txt LEOPOLDVILLt , Congo Republic , Jan. 19 ? The United Nations headquarters here hopes to be sending home by midsummer more than half the 18,000 U. N. , troops in the Congo . With the Moise Tshombe rebel independence regime in Katanga province humiliated and apparently broken , the central government stands unchallenged , at least for the moment . The Congo is wide open for a power grab such as that of Fidel Castro in Cuba or Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt . U. N. Advisers Needed Deprived of 40,000 Belgians who ran just about everything , the Congo is slipping into economic and financial chaos . The U. N. officials thus foresee a long need for troops and a longer and growing need for the 1,800 U. N. professional and skilled men and women who run things or are advising and training Congolese to take over . Five years is seen as a minimum , tiltho estimates for doing the job properly go up to 75 years . The rich Kasai region , the diamond state of the Congo , has been brought to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mutilated corpses mark the passage of marauding bands . Whole areas are in revolt and mission ' stations have been abandoned . 340 to 500 Die Reports from the region say that from 300 to 500 persons have died in the outburst which began Christmas eve . Tribesmen are on the march to try to snatch control of the region 's diamonds and other resources . The Congo civil operation is the biggest ever undertaken by the United Nations , and with military operations has cost 430 million dollars . Costs are running at 12 million dollars a month . In the beginning , the late Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold asked for 15 million dollars to do the whole job but within a month he saw that he Was badly wrong . In two and a half years , 232 United Nations persons , including Hammarskjold himself , have been killed . The U : N. wo n't say how many people its troops have killed . Congolese have died by the tens of thousands fighting among themselves , some estimates running as high as 100,000 . U. S. Gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The United States has met more than half of the U. N. 's 430 million dollar bill and ' has given to the Congo central government food , supplies , services and cash worth 125 million dollars . ' The United States air force , in ferrying U. N. troops to and from their homelands and supplying them with their ? often peculiar requirements , is operating the biggest airlift in history , surpassing in time and ton-miles the famed Berlin airlift.of 15 years ago . The job , if done commercially , would probably have cost half a billion dollars to date . The finances are in a mess and catastrophe is near . The government is spending at least three times its income and is already 500 million dollars in the red . The Congo currency has lost four-fifths of its value . When Swiss printers sent a bill for a planeload of 1,000 franc banknotes once worth 20 dollars each , the Congo government reportedly replied , " Run off some more and pay yourself . " Smuggling Is Common Smuggling and black markets are common . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a U. N. professor asked his economics class how the Congo 's problems could be solved , a student jumped up and said , " Kill the prime minister . " The administration is chaotic . " A minister 's power often ends with his desk , " a frustrated would - be reorganizer comments . Money sent to out of town offices often strays . Some teachers have gone 10 months without pay . In Belgian days , every office was run by Belgians . Congolese were clerks . The public services operate only if Belgians have remained or if the U. N. fills in with a skeleton service . The U. N. has been able to recruit only 600 teachers to replace , 500 Belgians , only 169 physicians to replace 800 . No American doctor has been attracted by the $7,500 a year salary plus expenses . Police are Menace The police without the Belgian officers are a menace . A householder , robbed 11 times in n year , caught a thief in his parlor at two in the morning ana marcnea mm to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job in the garden , " the thief said . The police let him go . A police car stopped a private car on a curve . along the four lane highway leading to the airport , accused the driver of failing to signal a left turn and then let him go on payment of a $20 bribe . The army , ? doubled to 60,000 and promising to absorb another 25,000 of Moise Tshombe 's Katanga troops , is paid American wages and soaks up a fourth of the government 's spending . It owes loyalty to no one , has already had three serious large mutinies and uncountable small ones . Two ex-sergeants promoted to generals , Joseph Mobutu and Victor Lundula , now promise to support the government and no longer line up their troops - against one another . Two other ex-sergeant generals have gone out of business . The armed men are an even bigger menace than the police . It is they who have killed most of their fellow Africans in the name of government , tribal feuds or just plain fun , lust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he goes power mad , " comments a victim . And , most dangerous of all , it is from among this armed group , that may most likely come the future rulers of the country . If such a man or men do emerge , they are apt to make Castro and Nasser look like America-loving angels . The armed gangs in and out of uniform make travel unsafe thru large areas . They have even stopped trains from running along sections of the main track . The destruction of two bridges now makes impossible train service between Stanleyville and Leopoldville on the Congo river in the north , and Elizabethville and Albertville in the south and east . Highways are going to pieces with no maintanence . Trucks are halted by lack , of spare parts but a thousand gift American trucks are on the way . Boat and barge traffic on the all-important Congo river is down to half . For a while ' the main port , Matadi , was silted up . Leave 169 Airports People and goods are taking to the air . The Belgians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleet . European crews backed by European mechanics now fly 50,000 passengers a month around the Congo , twice as many as in Belgian days . Most are Africans who , taking over Belgian jobs and salaries , are taking over Belgian ways . Soon after independence in July , 1960 , at least three-fourths of the 80,000 Belgians fled the Congo in a panic stirred by rape , murder and pillage . Some came back after U. N. troops arrived . Now planes from Europe are packed with returning Belgians and adventurers . About 40,00 Belgians are here but work almost entirely in business and industry . Hotels and apartments are jammed . Big Belgian plantations and mines , generally , are booming . Importers who operate on both the official and black markets never had life so good . Africans who promoted themselves into Belgian jobs , salaries , houses and cars are living high . Many others lower down the government payrolls have had their salaries quadrupled and are well off ? if they can collect their pay . All other Congolese are in a bad way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of working age had a job . Half of those jobs vanished with the Belgian flight . Leopoldville has grown from fewer than 300,000 persons to an estimated 800,000 . To get food , women are starting little gardens beside broad streets or in the rolling green countryside . In the country , Africans tend . to abandon the small plots which produced crops for sale , such as coffee and peanuts . No longer must they produce for the Belgian tax collector . The European buyers are more remote and getting the harvest to market is more difficult , Averted Another . Korea Native markets have fewer flashlights , pots and other goods for sale . And anyway , as ever , the abundant tropical nature will produce on its own enough roots and meat to sustain the body the natives say , so why work ? Despite all the problems and perils , the U. N. and American officials here are optimistic . They say things are bad now but were worse two years ago . The Americans say they have won in the Congo a major cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeezed out , " a diploma t exults . " We 've got a friendly government here . The Congo is the key to Africa . We could not have let in the Russians . If the U. N. had not done the job , we Americans would have had to do it by ourselves , with our own troops . " It 's a Rich Country Both the U. N. and the Americans here argue that the Congo is , by nature , a rich country . They point out the Belgians left a good system of transportation , commerce , administration , hospitals , primary schools , a splendidly built university . Most children are in school . Most people here can read and write altho only 17 have college degrees . But there seems to be an underlying mad quality of self destruction about the Congo . People tell the story of the hippopotamus who , not knowing the way across the Congo river , agreed to carry on his back a deadly scorpion who could not swim but knew the route . Halfway over , the scorpion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he . asked : " But why did you do it ? You knew we would both drown . " As the scorpion disappeared in the thick brown water , he replied : " That 's the way things are here . This is the Congo .
