Perched on observers ' chairs off to one side of the high-ceilinged hall that houses the U:N . Security Council , two rival delegations from the Congo last week waited eagerly to see which would be recognized by the U.N . as the legitimate voice of the Congolese government . In the end , as if talking over the heads of the Congolese , the Council decided to hear neither . For almost overnight the primary concern of the Security Council had shifted from the intricacies of Congolese politics to a crucial debate on the competence and authority of the U.N . itself . <P> The subject was the Congo , but the issue was whether the U.N . could hold the new ground it had staked out as an international midwife of newly born nations , or whether it should subside into the role of a debating society . <P> The challenge to the U.N . ' s new role came from Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Valerian Zorin who launched into a 75-minute attack on Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold and his conduct of the U.N . ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary-General in person , " cried Zorin , " ignore the lawful government of the Congo . They do not merely fail to help the government , but attempt to discredit it . They try to impede in every way the implementation of measures which the government is taking to restore order and normalcy in the country . They try to assist the countries of NATO and the U.S. in particular . . . in their imperialist designs in Africa . " <P> Zorin ended by demanding what amounted to a vote of censure of Hammarskjold and a directive sharply restricting his authority in the Congo . Dag Hammarskjold 's usually impassive face flushed with anger . " My record is on the table , " he said . " I stand by it . . . The U.N . is engaged in a major effort to give life and substance to the independence of the Congo . No misunderstandings , no misinformation , no misinterpretations of the actions of the U.N . should be permitted to hamper an operation the importance of which , I know , is fully appreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own , support the work of the U.N . in the Congo . " <P> Only Alternative . Springing to Dag Hammarskjold 's defense , newly installed U.S. Delegate James Wadsworth ( Cabot Lodge 's successor ) boomed : " U.S. policy in the Congo is simple . We support the U.N . wholeheartedly . We consider it the only satisfactory alternative to chaos , war and intervention . " Bluntly , Wadsworth ticked off what he said were the real reasons for Soviet rage at Hammarskjold . By closing the Congo 's airports and taking over the radio stations , the U.N . had weakened Premier Patrice Lumumba , whom Moscow had hoped to use as a cover for Soviet penetration of the new nation . If he fell , the Kremlin would have little hope of continuing the flow of Russian planes , matriel and military personnel with which , charged Wadsworth , Moscow hoped to establish " a Soviet satellite state in the heart of Africa .
