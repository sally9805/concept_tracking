The Dallas Cowboys once believed that they could win the East on the strength of their stunning defense . They were wrong . Balance is a requisite for success in the NFL , and this year the Cowboys have it . The defense is as stout as ever , and Dallas will win the Eastern championship with a suddenly potent offense  --  the running of Don Perkins and Mel Renfro , the passing of Don Meredith and the receiving of Bob Hayes , Pete Gent , Buddy Dial , Norman Pettis and Frank Clarke . The blocking of an offensive line that has been together long enough to become first-rate will afford the spindly-legged Meredith time to pass and enough weeks of good health to lead the team to the divisional title . // Coach Tom Landry , who in the past devoted most of his energies to fashioning the complicated but crushing defense , has now turned his considerable talents to souping up the Dallas offense . His first move was to shift one of his best defensive players from safety to running back . Mel Renfro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an All-League safety in 1965 . With luck and good blocking he could be an All-Pro halfback in 1966 . Whether he is depends on the speed with which he adjusts to the subtleties of his new role . // " He is still uncertain on his moves when he comes out wide , " Landry says . " His timing with the guards when they pull out to lead him is not good yet . He has to learn to wait for them . But I 'm sure he will . " // Given the wide threat of Renfro and the in-and-out slashing of Perkins , the Cowboys could have the best deep threat from a running attack in football . As of now the Packers are the best running team , but their specialty is short-haul banging . Perkins and Renfro have the speed to score from anywhere on the field . // Landry has installed a roll-out pass offense for Meredith , hoping to force opposing defenses into man-to-man coverage on either Renfro or Hayes , who is , as they say , the world 's fastest human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work on during the week , " Landry says . " And we think that Don is one of the better scramblers . He is very good at picking out a receiver while he is moving around back there . " // Meredith is , indeed , one of the league 's better scramblers . He is not quite in Fran Tarkenton 's class , but he has a better offensive line protecting him , which means that he does not have to be as agile as the Minnesota quarterback . Given time to unload the ball , he is a devastating passer , and he is throwing to the fastest set of receivers in the game . // " I think our offense will be better than it has ever been , " Meredith says . " I really do n't see how they can stop us . If I get in trouble I 've always got Renfro for a safety valve . I can throw him a three-yard pass and he turns it into a 60-yard touch , and the record book reads ' Meredith to Renfro for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the record book will also read " Meredith to Hayes for 60 and a touch , " since Hayes , the Olympic sprint champion , is on his way to becoming the finest deep receiver ever to play the game . Besides his 9.1 sprinter 's speed , Flanker Hayes has exceptionally sure hands and a real football sense , differing in this respect from most track men who have switched sports . He has good moves already , and these will get more sophisticated as he plays . // At split end the Cowboys have a former basketball star who did not play college football . He is Pete Gent , 6 feet 4 and 214 pounds , from Michigan State . In his third year with the Cowboys , he is finally acclimated to the pro game and is an excellent receiver . Because the Cowboys frequently flood one side of the field with Hayes and Renfro , Gent will be overlooked by some defenses , and this will be costly . He has the good hands and quick fakes of a basketball player and any overconcentration on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // There is little more that Landry can do to polish his defense , one of the best in either division . The front line , built around Bob Lilly and George Andrie , is second only to the Ram front four . Tough Lee Roy Jordan has matured into a knowledgeable , quick middle linebacker . He is flanked by Chuck Howley , a corner linebacker who has not received the credit he deserves , and Dave Edwards or Harold Hays . // The Dallas secondary is a capable unit , even though Landry has taken Renfro from his safety spot to spice the offense . Mike Gaechter , who replaces him , is just as fast and more experienced . Warren Livingston , Obert Logan and Cornell Green all have exceptional speed . Livingston and Green have 11 years of experience between them ; Logan , in his second year , was one of the good surprises of the Cowboy camp a year ago and is even better now . // With a decline in the quality of the opposition in the East and an increase in their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
