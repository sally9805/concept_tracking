" You have to say she 's kind of radical , " confided Emil ( " Bus " ) Mosbacher , as he watched the slim , white hull slide down the ways of City Island , N.Y . Along with 500 well-wishers , Mosbacher was on hand last week for the launching of Intrepid , the 12-meter yacht he will skipper against Australia in the America 's Cup this fall . It took only half an eye to see that she was a far cry from the old Weatherly Bus sailed to victory against the Aussies ' Gretel in 1962-or for that matter , from any other 12-meter ever put together . <P> Designed by Olin Stephens , the man responsible for three of the last four cup winners , * Intrepid is not a particularly graceful-looking boat . With a bobbed bow and a truncated stern , she is only 64 ft. long overall , 45 ft. at the waterline , compared with 68 ft. and 46 ft. for Columbia and Constellation . An obvious advantage is weight ; Stephens figures that he saved more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , says Stephens , without the usual heavy fore and aft overhang , the short-ended Intrepid will be less prone to lose speed by hobbyhorsing in rough seas around the Cup course off Newport , R.I. To keep the boat 's center of gravity low and thus increase her stability in a breeze , Stephens prescribed lightweight titanium for the top third of Intrepid 's 90-ft. mast , even went so far as to set the heavy sheet winches below decks rather than topside-which brought cracks that he ought to install sun lamps for the winch tenders . <P> Intrepid is most far-out way down under . Instead of a single rudder set on the keel , she has two-a main steering rudder set well aft on a long stabilizing skeg , plus a narrow " tab rudder " mounted on the unusually short keel . Controlled with its own wheel in the helmsman 's cockpit , the tab will perform something like the trim tabs on aircraft ailerons , which balance planes for level , effortless flight . When beating to windward , the tab should offset the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On reaches and spinnaker runs , the two rudders can be linked together for maximum steering control . <P> Rum Go . For all Stephens ' daring with the new $350,000 boat , he admits that " I have my fingers crossed . We 'll just have to see how it works . " If it does n't , the seven-member Intrepid syndicate has Constellation in reserve . Mosbacher has already been putting Constellation to use on weekend sail-handling drills , looking over a 27-man crew for the ten who will eventually make up his first team . Whatever boat Mosbacher sails , he expects a rum go from at least two other U.S. hopefuls : a rebuilt Columbia , which is being run by a West Coast syndicate , and American Eagle , which gave Constellation a pretty good battle in the 1964 trials . <P> Then there are the Australians . Mosbacher rated Gretel an " awfully good boat " when Jock Sturrock sailed her in 1962 . Sturrock now has the new Dame Pattie , and that boat , as Mosbacher says , " has been beating Gretel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gretel 's owner , Sir Frank Packer , has altered his boat for the third time , and won himself another series of trials , Sturrock &; Co. will almost certainly be at Newport in September . <P> *Ranger in 1937 , Columbia in 1958 , Constellation in 1964.
