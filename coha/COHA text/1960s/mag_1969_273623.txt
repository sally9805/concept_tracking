Showing the flag is an ancient ploy that has worn a bit thin . Richard Nixon 's decision to show American military might last week was an appropriate reaction in the face of severe North Korean provocation . But he may have overdone it somewhat . In response to North Korea 's destruction of a U.S. EC-121 spy plane over international waters , the President gave sailing orders to Task Force 71 , a 40-ship armada assigned the task of protecting future reconnaissance flights near North Korea . <P> The force included three attack aircraft carriers and an anti-submarine aircraft carrier , with a total of more than 200 planes , three cruisers , 22 destroyers , at least five submarines , five or six supply ships and , briefly , U.S.S. New Jersey , the world 's only operative battleship . A perplexing question is why so formidable a fleet was needed . <P> Risks Remain . Pentagon officials argued that defense of the lumbering spy planes requires many jet fighters . Ostensibly , the size and power of TF-71 were intended to discourage North Korea from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration . During the presidential campaign , Nixon had maintained that the U.S. should react to small provocations lest they grow into large incidents . There were plenty of hawks around last week to remind him of that remark . <P> It would certainly have been imprudent to deploy a force vulnerable to North Korean airpower . But there were risks in any case . Would Premier Kim II Sung look upon the force as a constraint or a challenge ? If the North Korean dictator chose the latter view , further conflict could easily develop . In fact , the North Koreans reacted sharply to the force 's presence . Kim announced an increase of 11% in his military budget as a result of the new U.S. " threat , " thereby raising North Korea 's annual defense spending to $561 million . <P> Costly and Limited . At week 's end it seemed that the Administration was drawing back from its show of strength . About 20 of the 29 surface warships of TF-71 were redeployed from the Sea of Japan to the Yellow Sea , possibly in response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the eastern side of the Korean peninsula to its western approaches . More important , it moves the ships farther from Soviet shores , making them less provocative to Moscow . In any event , it seems that TF-71 will be only a temporary measure . General Earle G. Wheeler , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told a special House investigating committee last week that TF-71 is " inordinately expensive " and can only be maintained for " a limited period of time . " Wheeler noted further that earlier attempts to protect the reconnaissance flights had proved " very expensive and relatively ineffective " and , had been stopped .
