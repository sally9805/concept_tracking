Even in the age of the atom , steel is still the vital measure of industrial might . The Soviet Union has made it national policy to catch up with U.S. steel production , the world 's largest , and the other large steel producing nations never cease jockeying for advantage . Since World War II , no nation has reached for big steel status with more success than Japan , whose industry is among the world 's most advanced and whose exports have raised the ire of competitors in both the U.S. and Europe . Now Japan has taken over from West Germany as the world 's third largest producer , having turned out 34 million tons of high quality steel in the fiscal year that ended in March v. 33 million tons for the Germans . <P> From southern Kyushu to northern Honshu , the classic brush-painting coastline of Japan has been transformed into dynamic montages of modern wealth . Fire and smoke belch forth from towering blast furnaces that gobble up a steady stream of coal , iron ore and limestone from huge supertankers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most modern steelmaking equipment , have 14 ore-to-ingot plants operating at nearly 95% of capacity and another four being built . Japan ranks second to the U.S. in up-to-date strip-mill capacity and produces 38% of its steel by the speedy , economical oxygen process , while only 10% of U.S. steel is made that way . <P> Unexpected Boom . The American occupation triggered the modernization of Japan 's steelmaking . Occupation planners declared the steel industry essential , thus enabling it to progress from a complete halt in production on V-J day to an output of 6,000,000 tons by 1951 , when the peace treaty was signed . At the same time , the old government monopoly , Japan Steel &; Iron Co. , was broken up into Yawata Iron &; Steel Co. and Fuji Iron &; Steel Co. , currently Japan 's two largest producers . Encouraged by the authorities , competition flourished ; today Japan has 62 steelmakers . But 55% of production is still accounted for by the nation 's big four , who are rounded out by Nihon Kokan and Kawasaki Steel . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the acknowledged leader of the Japanese steel industry : Shigeo Nagano , 64 , Fuji 's president . The son of a Buddhist priest and himself a Judo expert with a reputation for forcefulness , Nagano pressed for renovation and expansion of the industry despite official reluctance and occasional opposition from financial circles , who could not see so clearly as he the role steel would play in reconstruction . Following his lead , the industry inaugurated a $358 million , five-year capital expansion program in 1951 . Japan 's accelerated recovery , and the shipbuilding and railroad booms it brought , dwarfed even the most optimistic projections . Steelmen put $1.9 billion into a second five-year plan that doubled production , and in 1961 launched a third plan that will cost $3 billion , bring production to 42 million tons by the end of 1966.
