Efforts of Manhattan bankers to change the law have always been blocked by a coalition of small-town Republicans and solid Democratic opposition in the state legislature . Among the caged banking Goliaths : the Chase Manhattan ( assets : $8.5 billion ) , whose vice chairman is David Rockefeller , brother of New York 's Governor Nelson Rockefeller . <P> Last week , at the urging of Brother Nelson , the state legislature passed an omnibus banking bill that lifted the blockade . Its main provisions : 1 ) holding companies will be permitted to buy banks anywhere under state supervision ; 2 ) New York commercial and savings banks may open suburban branches , and suburban banks may now invade New York City . <P> As expected , there were suburban wails .
