THE GREAT FORGERY ( 501 pp. ) - Edith Simon-Little , Brown ( $5.95 ) . <P> Matthew Gorer is a painter , but there has been no one like him since Joyce Gary 's Gulley Jimson . Savage , idealistic , scruffy and lecherous , Gorer is at once a fiercely dedicated man with the humility of a prostrate priest and the arrogance that the world imposes on a neglected seer . <P> Scrounging Hell . The reader meets Gorer in London shortly before World War II on the night that he seduces Cassy Beaumont , which is the night that his unsuccessful one-man show closes . The teen-age daughter of an English father and a West Indian mother , Cassy is so pleased with the quasi rape and the beating that Gorer gives her afterward that she soon moves in with him . Their life together is the scrounging , violent hell without which she would have been disappointed . And Gorer keeps on painting , and cursing and talking-lewdly , sharply , wisely-and grabbing any woman who comes within his surprising reach . Commissioned by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country house , Gorer uses his idle time to seduce Mrs. Hanshawe . But this time Gorer gets his comeuppance . For Hanshawe retaliates by luring Cassy away from Gorer and marries her . <P> Lonely , embittered by disregard , Gorer decides to revenge himself on the world in one fell swipe . He sets out to forge a Holbein . The forgery is successful , critics hail the new discovery , and the picture is sold for 40,000 guineas . Then Gorer triumphantly reveals that he forged the painting . <P> The Maggots . Haled into court for fraud , Matthew Gorer does not defend himself ; instead , he lectures the court and the public on the arid conventionality of a society that accepts art only if it has been certified by recognized authorities . " So to show you what 's going on I set about painting a picture which everyone would praise without fail , for all the wrong reasons . I wanted to show up the pundits and the cranks , the speculators and the snobs , the whole bunch of maggots . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prison for a year . Gorer fails , too , to make the pundits say why a " masterpiece " with a certain signature becomes worthless when the signature is changed . <P> This question was raised and left unanswered in actuality by the postwar trial of Holland 's Han van Meegeren for forging Vermeers-the case that prompted Edith Simon to write this novel . The 44-year-old wife of a University of Edinburgh don , Author Simon was born in Berlin of German parents , did not learn English until her parents moved to Britain when she was 14 . Since then , she has published ten books in English , ranging from a distinguished study of the Knights Templars to The Golden Hand , a novel of 14th century England that ranks with the finest historical fiction of this century . Altogether , Edith Simon 's works comprise a virtuoso display of versatility .
