MY BROTHER BRENDAN by Dominic Behan. 159 pages . Simon &; Schuster. $4.50 . <P> <P> The late Irish playwright Brendan Behan ( The Hostage ) and his younger , less successful playwright brother Dominic ( Posterity Be Damned ) were once described as the most alarming combination since assault and battery . In this graceless little memoir Dominic sets out to recount some of the escapades that gave them their reputation . Although he sometimes strikes a rollicking note by writing in an Irish dialect as heavy as Kilkenny dew , all Dominic proves is that 1 ) Brendan , who died in 1964 , was especially unattractive and unmanageable when in his cups ; and 2 ) drunks seldom are very funny except to those who are sharing the same bottle . <P> <P> TELL THE TIME TO NONE by Helen Hudson . 249 pages . Duffon. $4.95 . <P> <P> Cowardice , pride , propriety , fear of fame-there are many reasons why writers choose to hide behind noms de plume . The author of this clean-cut gem of a first novel clearly was motivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of faculty politics and makes the ambitions and jealousies of her professors and their wives so sadly true that it is obvious she occupies , or once occupied , her own glade in the groves of academe . <P> <P> DE GAULLE by Francois Mauriac . 229 pages . Doubleday . $4.50 . <P> <P> French Academician Francois Mauriac , Nobel Prize novelist ( Therese ) , biographer ( Life of Jesus ) , political polemicist and poet , first became aware of Charles de Gaulle during the long night of German occupation . Unlike many of his countrymen , Mauriac has kept his vision of De Gaulle shining ever since . In this odd book-neither a biography nor a wholly accurate account of De Gaulle 's politics but a kind of personal political devotional-Mauriac , 80 , tries to explain just what it is about De Gaulle that commands his fealty . He attests that he is not obsessed with De Gaulle , but , unhappily , this does not prove to be true : Mau-riac 's quivering admiration simply is too great to be contained . The reader never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is merely reassured in passage after adulatory passage that it is there like a towering , providential Alp , and that De Gaulle is correct when he states with " calm certainty that he is the State and , it may not be too much to say , France herself .
