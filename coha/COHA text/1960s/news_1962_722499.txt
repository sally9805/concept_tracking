txt President Kennedy issued a stern warning . to the flight engineers ' union today to refrain from striking against three major airlines . The Government 's efforts to settle a contract dispute collapsed a few hours before Mr. Kennedy spoke . About 1,700 members of the Flight Engineers International Association were preparing to strike against Eastern Air Lines , Inc. , Pan American World Airways and Trans World Airlines , Inc. , but the union would not disclose exact strike plans . A top union official said that there would be no strike tonight . But he said that a strike would be called against one airline within forty-eight hours . He would not name the airline , raising the possibility that the union was considering a " divide and conquer " tactic of letting two airlines operate while trying to shut down the third . Gives Stern Admonition The President began his news conference this afternoon with ' , a stern admonition to the union to settle the issues without striking . Earlier , the union turned down a Presidential proposal to submit its contract dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Kennedy 's criticism was strongly phrased for a Democratic President talking about a labor union . He may have had in mind accusations , made since his attack on steel price increases two months ago , that he has been harder on business than on labor . A union spokesman said that the union would have no comment on the President 's remarks until tomorrow . Mr. Kennedy said that the nation 's welfare and economy would be seriously damaged by strike .

The strike would cause the immediate lay-off of some 60 , - ) 00 employes , the immobilization of 40 per cent of the naDontinued Continued From rage 1 , Col. 8 bon 's airline service and the loss of more than $1,000,000 a day from international flights , he said . The country 's balance of payments can not afford the loss , the President said . Mr. Kennedy outlined the effOrts made by the Government to settle the dispute in the last two years . The union has rejected or failed to cooperate in those efforts , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet their public responsibilities , to reconsider their action and to either submit this case to arbitration or agree with the carriers on some other means of settling this dispute without any interruption of operation , " the President said . Mr , Kennedy would not say what plans , if any , he had for dealing with a strike Question 1.1 It is conceivable , although unlikely , that he might try to seize strikebound carriers by administrative action . He might ask Congress for seizure power or power to compel the union and airlines to submit their dispute to arbitration  --  a step that the lines have already agreed to . His Presidential powers under the Railway Labor Act have been exhausted . It is also possible that the President might do nothing . In that event , the flight engineers ' union might face extinction in a long , hard battle . - Object to Training Clause Members of the rival Air Line Pilots Association , after undergoing the training and tests prescribed by the Federal Aviation ' Agency for flight engineers ' certificates , could move into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly , provided service personnel would gross the flight engineers ' picket lines . The engineers ' union claims the support of other key unions in the United States and abroad . The main issue in the dispute is how the size of jet cockpit crews will be reduced from four men to three . The flight engineers ' union fears that , in the process , the jobs its members hold will be absorbed into the pilots ' jurisdiction and it will be wiped out . The flight engineers ' union kas been trying to thwart that result by keeping out of its contracts any provision requiring its members to take pilot training . A special Presidential study Commission , three , Presidential emergency boards and a Presidential arbitration panel have all said . that the flight engineers on jets should have some degree of pilot training . Those , who successfully take such training should have prior rights to the jobs created by combining the positions of flight engineer and third pilot in the reduction of the jet cockpit crew , these panels have said . Those who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their jobs , according to the recommendations . The airlines favor these recommendations . The Administration 's view is that the flight engineers have been offered every chance to settle the dispute on a reasonable basis . The engineers assert that the pilots are engaged ' in a " job steal . " - The issue of jobs on the airlines has been complicated by the transition from piston-engine aircraft to the bigger , faster jets . With the jets , fewer crew members are needed to transport more passengers . Hoped for Settlement The concern over jobs is also being felt by workers in other industries in which rapid technological change is constricting the number of jobs . The Administration had hoped that a peaceful settlement of the airline dispute would help create a climate in which similar disputes could be resolved more easily . The dispute was one of the first in which the Administration intervened , and White House prestige was riding on the outcome . Asher Schwartz , attorney for the union , said that the union could not accept the President 's arbitration proposal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Made too limted by previous awards and recommendations , he said .
