Short Notices THE DOUBLE HELIX by James D. Watson . 226 pages . Atheneum. $5.95 . <P> <P> When he was only 24 , Chicago-born Author Watson helped solve the structure of the heredity-determining DNA molecule , a major feat for which he and British Scientists Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins eventually shared a Nobel prize . Now , 15 years later , he has written a highly literate day-by-day account of his experiences ( the title is drawn from the spiral-staircase shape of DNA ) . The book will lead readers to important discoveries of their own : scientific research is not necessarily the calm , orderly process so tritely portrayed in modern legend , and scientists are all too human . <P> <P> Watson describes his own shortcomings of laziness and lack of direction ; his narrow escape from physical attack by a female crystallographer when he challenged her theories ; the abrasive personality of talented Co-worker Crick ; an incredible high school-level error by brilliant Chemist Linus Pauling that temporarily threw him off course , enabling Watson and Crick to win the DNA race ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where much of the great work was carried out . Burdened by the complex details of DNA research , Double Helix does not quite close the gap between C. P. Snow 's " two cultures , " but certainly narrows it . <P> <P> BEAUTY BEAST by MacKinlay Kantor. 382 pages . Putnam. $6.95 . <P> <P> This is a book that should give pause to the Pulitzer Prize committee that awarded the palm to its author for a novel that was stronger but not much better ( Andersonville ) . The new novel 's problem is simple enough : What happens when a twice-widowed white woman falls in love with her male mulatto cook ? Pretty much what one would expect down on the Gulf Coast in 1854 . He is handsome and graceful and goes by the name of Beauty Beast . He knows what to do with herbs and French sauces , and he can play Mozart and lesser composers on the pianoforte . His mistress , Sidney Shallop , has never known anything more moving . <P> Of course Sidney 's happiness can not last and Beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that he goes to his death with pride in his blackness and with no regard for what in him is owed to inherited whiteness . That touch is convincing enough , but not the narrative style ( " When first Sidney saw Beauty Beast come walking with buoyant zeal , flesh of her nature lay scorched again " ) . There is something wildly outdated about such plantation-patented prose .
