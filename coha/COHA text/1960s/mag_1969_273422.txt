The heaven , even the heavens , are the Lord 's ; but the earth hath he given to the children of men . - Psalm 115 <P> While man is taking new steps into the heavens , religious thinkers are pondering again some of the issues that space travel raises for faith . In churches and synagogues , the flight of Apollo 8 was a favorite topic for sermons , particularly because of the astronauts ' reading the opening verses of Genesis as a Christmas Eve message to mankind. * A number of clergymen feel that growing knowledge of the immensity of the universe may prove to be a stimulus to renewed faith in God the creator . Contemplating the sight of the earth seen from thousands of miles in space , observes Episcopal Chaplain Malcolm Boyd , " might open up new dimensions in conceiving of God , of dealing with the enhanced mystery . " Whether or not this is a vain hope , a number of churchmen have suggested that the time has come for Christianity to produce an up-to-date " astro-theology .

A modest but perplexing dilemma would result from the discovery of intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe . The question then would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Extraterrestrial evangelism might not be necessary , suggests Dr. Per Massing of the Boston University School of Theology .

If there are beings on another planet , then they must be the object of another Providence . They are not the children of Adam , and so they are not a part of our salvation history , which is that of a fallen and redeemed race . "
