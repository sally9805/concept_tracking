" All of us ought to be against anything in our textbooks that would teach subversion or integration , " cried fiery Ross Barnett , a white supremacist who happens to be Governor of Mississippi . Last week Barnett got a new blunderbuss to crush the forces of darkness : he took over the selection of all public-school textbooks in Mississippi . No other U.S. Governor can boast such power . <P> Under the old ( and typically American ) system , Mississippi 's state superintendent of education appointed committees of teachers to recommend books to local school boards . But the system seemed perilous to the Daughters of the American Revolution , who found the words of many a " subversive " author passing before the eyes of schoolchildren . Among such authors ( most of them in standard anthologies of American literature ) : Novelist Jack London , Playwright Arthur Miller , Poets Carl Sandburg and Archibald MacLeish . <P> When the D.A.R . protested to former Governor J. P. Coleman in 1958 , he defended the book-buying system and managed to keep it intact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the D.A.R. , as well as with the equally agitated American Legion and Citizens ' Councils . <P> Up before the state house of representatives last week was a senate-approved bill empowering the Governor to appoint four members of each seven-man committee in some 40 categories of books . ( The Governor already heads a state board that buys books chosen by the schools . ) " Clean up our textbooks , " urged Barnett . " Our children must be properly informed of the Southern and true American way of life . " <P> Legislators pointed out that the Governor 's appointees need not even be educators . Said one house member : " You are setting into motion the greatest juggernaut of thought control ever devised by man . " But the majority ruled . By a vote of 82 to 44 , the house sent on the bill for Barnett 's signature .
