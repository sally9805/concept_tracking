txt The 1969 Legislature adjourned tonight after a final spurt in which the Republican - controlled body passed bills to increase pay for top appointed state officials and three New York City District Attorneys . The Legislature also voted to raise the expense allowances of legislative committee chairmen and senior minority members . In addition , Senate Majority Leader Earl W. Brydges , complaining that legislators are " grossly underpaid , " said a blue-ribbon committee of nonlegislators would be appointed to study the salary question and make recommendations in time for action by the next session of the Legislature . " Perhaps they will recommend additional compensation and allowances to reflect the value of these men , " the Republican leader said . Both houses passed a resolution authorizing the legislative leaders to establish the committee . Governor Rockefeller , in a surprise move , tonight signed into law a bill banning the use of busing by appointed school boards and the State Commis ' - sioner of Education as a means of integrating public schools . One of the Legislature 's final acts was to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York City this year to allow the members of mayoral tickets to appear together on the ballot in the same horizontal orl vertical column . The measure was sent back to be killed in committee in ' the Assembly , after the Republican leadership acknowledged ' that the votes for passage were not available . On the salary issue ; all 207 legislators receive an annual salary of $15,000 plus a lump-sum expense allowance of $3,000 . Some committee chairmen and ranking minority members receive additional expense allowances . Mr. Brydges receives an allowance of $21,000 , in addition to the regular $18,000 for a total of $39,000 ; the Assembly Speaker gets the same . The final gavel of the 192d session of the Legislature was cracked in the Senate at 10:10 P.M. by Lieut . Gov . Malcolm - Wilson , ending a 115-day meeting that began Jan. 8 . The Assembly had finisehd its business and adjourned almost an hour earlier , at 9:18 . The Legislature 's adjournment resolution had set 2 P.M. today as the time for finishing the year 's work , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-winded than usual and the clocks in both houses , by tradition , were stopped before 2 P.M. The windup was further delayed by unexpected snags in a bill to provide an additional $5-million for the SEEK program , which helps disadvantaged students attend college . But , with some mediation by Governor Rockefeller , the problem  --  which centered on an apparent attempt by Senate Republicans to deny SEEK - funds to the City University of New York ? was straightened out . Bill Is Amended The bill was amended to protect the university 's funds and the adjournment machinery cranked into motion again . The closing scenes of this session of the Legislature were a replay of all the adjournment scenes of sessions past . In ' flowery rhetoric everybody praised everybody else for being so helpful through the year . and for working so hard . The farewell handshakes and backslapping had much-of theaura of children saying goodbye on the last day of summer camp . Also a- replay were the contradictory partisan press releases issued by the leaders of the Republican majority and the Democratic minority . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said " the work of this session can best be characterized as an baccurate response to public mandate " and Senator Brydges said the Legislature " scored an A-plus . " The Republican Governor praised the Legislature for " a high degree of wisdom and statesmanship . " In predictable contrast , the Democratic minority leaders , Stanley Steingut in the Assembly and Joseph Zaretzki in the Senate , called it " the year of the great leap backward , " contending that the Governor and the Republican majorities , " marching relentlessly to the rear . . . have succeeded in dragging us back into the 18th century . " Even the pay-increase bills bore the stamp of tradition . Difference in Debates Curiously , the Senate and Assembly debates on the pay bill were quite different from each other . In the Senate most legislators complained about being underpaid and about being " clobbered " by the press every time they try to improve their financial lot . In the Assembly , however , most members said it was disgraceful that the Legis-1 lature was giving pay increases ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " budget for the state in March that made drastic cuts in aid to welfare , Medicaid and schools . One Assemblyman , Guy R. Brewer , a Queens Democrat , shouted during the debate : " I can not see how in God 's name we can cut aid to education and , be prepared to throw old peo ple out of nursing homes , put them in the streets , and then raise the salaries of these liquor commissioners and horseracing commissioners . " The raises for top state officials included increases from $32,000 to $33,600 for the Chairmen of the State Liquor Authority and the Harness Racing Commission , from $26 , - 200 to $27,500 for the Commissioners of the Liquor Authority and from $23,500 to $24.675 for the Commissioners of the Harness Commission . The pay increases for the appointed officials , which ranged as high as $1,900 a year , were contained in a bill implementing the $90-million wage contract the Rockefeller Administration recently negotiated with 132,000 of the state 's civil service employes . The appointed officials , who are not in civil service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state agency heads , the Secretary of State , the Counsel to the Governor , Secretary to the Governor , and the Budget Director ) , will receive the same 5 per cent salary increase as the civil service employes
