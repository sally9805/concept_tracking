LAWD TODAY ( 189 pp. ) - Richard Wright-Walker &; Co. ( $3.50 ) . <P> " It is a complex fate to be an American . " That this goes double for the American Negro , Novelist James Baldwin has made clear . As a spokesman for his generation of U.S. Negroes ( TIME , Jan. 4 ) , Baldwin demonstrates how complicated can be the business of defining what that fate is . Things were simpler for yesterday 's generation , which had its voice in the novels of Richard Wright , who died in 1960 , aged 52 . <P> Wright 's Lawd Today was never published during his life , and it predates Native Son , which established his reputation . It tells of a dreadful day in the dreadful life of Jake Jackson , a faceless phantom of insulted life from Chicago 's black ghetto . Greedy , but with never enough ham hocks and collard greens , lecherous , but always frustrated , aggressive , but always a victim ( even to his beaten , tumor-plagued wife , who cuts him up bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jake is no left-wing stereotype of a good man . He and society match each other in crude nastiness . The Depression and the code of " The Man " ( meaning the white man ) press down on him like the lid on a garbage can . <P> Common Demand . Speaking of Wright today , Baldwin observes : " Today 's racial manifestoes are being written very differently . " Where is the difference ? With Wright , the pain of being a Negro is basically economic-its site is mainly in the pocket . With Baldwin , the pain suffuses the whole man , so that he can not even stand the white liberals who would " offer " him the equality that is his by right . <P> <P> Wright today should be judged , Baldwin says , by " how accurately or deeply the life of Chicago 's South Side had been conveyed . " It is hard to judge . Even if half-true , Lawd Today is an appalling document . As an artist , Wright was as crude and humorlessly " sincere " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro of Baldwin 's generation would not be as credulous as was Wright 's Jake Jackson , who was dazzled by a preposterous parade of a mythical black army headed by " The Supreme Undisputed Exalted Commander of the Allied Imperial African War Councils unto the Fourth and Last Generations . " Yet Baldwin himself has admitted to having been tempted by the less bizarre but more sinister desperado politics of the Black Muslims . If Baldwin 's sights are higher than Wright 's , it is in part because Wright helped to raise them . Wright and Baldwin had had one thing in common : the demand to be treated as men . When this elementary thing is denied , no wonder fantasy comes as an only friend . <P> The Cage . Wright saw society as an iron cage for his Jake Jackson . There was no key ; the cage must be smashed . Nothing less than revolutionary Communism would do . But the Communists betrayed Wright as badly as Baldwin feels let down by the white liberals . The time came when he saw that colored comrades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comrades . Wright abandoned the fight and fled to Paris with his white wife .
