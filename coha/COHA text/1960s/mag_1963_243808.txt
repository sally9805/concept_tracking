The chance that any woman will give birth to live , healthy quadruplets is about one in 2,500,000 . So when X rays showed that Barbara Axe , 26 , was carrying quads , she felt challenged . She told her obstetrician : " I 'm snoopy . If you 're likely to make medical history , it would be nice to see it . " Last week she made it and saw it . <P> <P> Husband Philip , advertising promotion man for the Lima ( Ohio ) Citizen , was taking a nap when Barbara felt the bag of waters break . A registered nurse and already mother of three , she calmly phoned for an ambulance before awakening her husband . And at St. Rita 's Hospital , where Dr. Vernon Noble found her in excellent health , she got just the sort of treatment she had asked for : only a local anesthetic before delivery . Baby girl No. 1 ( 4 lbs . 2 oz. ) arrived at 3:27 p.m. ; No. 2 ( same weight ) at 3:29 ; No. 3 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3:40 p.m. ; and No. 4 ( 3 lbs . 12 oz. ) at 3:45 . As each baby was born , Dr. Noble held her up and the mother listened to their successive cries . <P> <P> Barbara Axe seemed faintly disappointed that the babies were all girls . But she had another kind of compensation . Around Lima , scarcely one out of 20 mothers watches the birth of her own children , but she had combined her curiosity with her condition to hit a 50 million-to-1 shot and see the delivery of her own quadruplets.
