The maharajah was then paying $585.60 a year to have his copy air-expressed to him each week ; 20,000 other overseas subscribers waited for their copies to reach them by ship . <P> This week , as TIME marks its 37th birthday ( first issue date : March 3 , 1923 ) , 544,000 copies of TIME 'S four international editions will be air-speeded everywhere in the free world-sending TIME 'S total worldwide circulation to a new high : more than 3,000,000 , with an estimated readership of 12,500,000 in 121 countries . <P> The breakdown : <P> <P> U.S. edition 2,480,000 <P> TIME Latin America 69,000 <P> TIME Pacific 100,000 <P> TIME Atlantic 160,000 <P> TIME Canada 215,000 <P> Worldwide 3,024,000 <P> The international editions are printed at plants in Tokyo , Melbourne , Havana , Paris and Chicago .
