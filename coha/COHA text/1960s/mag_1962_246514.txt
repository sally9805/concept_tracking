Ever since astronomers first analyzed the atmosphere of Jupiter and found a blanket of noxious gases thousands of miles thick , most scientists have assumed that the distant planet is devoid of life . But just because earthlings could not live there , says British Amateur Astronomer Axel Firsoff , is no reason to believe that Jupiter is not a populous place . Animals might well thrive even if their planet is covered with a limpid ocean of cold , liquid ammonia . <P> Life on earth , Firsoff points out in the British magazine Discovery , is based on the reaction of carbon compounds in water solution . But liquid water is not entirely necessary for life . Jupiter is apparently well stocked with ammonia ( NH3 ) , and Firsoff argues that the ammonia would be as satisfactory a solvent as water for supporting life . <P> " Ammono " chemistry , says the astronomer , is very different from earth 's familiar " aquo " chemistry , but there are vital similarities . Both systems produce some well-known compounds , among them the amino acids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the first living organisms evolved on earth , the atmosphere above the primeval ocean contained ammonia but no free oxygen . When oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and ammonia disappeared , life on earth adapted itself to the new conditions . The amino acids that form earth 's proteins , says Firsoff , are relics of the prehistoric conditions under which earth life was born . <P> The digestive systems of modern animals , Firsoff explains , depend on hydrolysis , a process in which proteins , sugars and other compounds are broken down in combination with water . Creatures that have ammonia instead of water in their tissues , would digest food by ammonolysis , i.e. , by combining it with ammonia . Instead of oxydizing food to liberate energy as earth 's animals do , Jovian animals would combine it with nitrogen , and the final product would be cyanogen ( CN ) 2 , a gas that is violently poisonous to life on earth . " Jovian animals , " says Astronomer Firsoff , " could breathe nitrogen and drink liquid ammonia . Whether they do remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
