txt California Gov . Ronald Reagan , while gazing at lofty presidential peaks in the distance , may be about to fall off a political cliff at home . His backers nationally , on July 21 , plan to beam a Reagan speech to the nation for a full prime-time half hour over the Columbia Broadcasting System . Yet , paradoxically , 10 days later he may find himself facing a recall election at home . Citizens for Reagan nationally already have bought the prime time July 21 . The Governor will preempt " Gentle Ben " that Sunday night . And the nation will see a tape of a hard-hitting anticrime , antiadministration speech ' . he Governor delivered last month in Indianapolis . But meanwhile the recall threat suddenly is serious enough to have frozen the smile on every pro-Reagan countenance in California . Governor Reagan has said from the start he is n't a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination ? only a favorite son . But as the Miami convention nears , it is clear the Governor will permit his name to be put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a candidate . With less than a month left before the GOP National Convention he is about to // *Reagan tries hand at brinkmanship // launch a fast-clipped national speechmaking swing . And besides the prime-time TV half hour July 21 , he will be interviewed on a nationwide TV show July 28 . His political fund-raising swing begins July 19 , through Amarillo , Tex. , Little Rock , Ark. , and Charlottsville , Va . On July 21 , the very day he arrives in Cincinnati for the National Governor 's Conference , the rerun of his Indianapolis speech will blossom on prime time . From Cincinnati he heads for Birmingham , Ala. , for another fund-raising thrust . And on July 30 he will fly off to North Carolina for a final foray before the Miami convention . Report denied Political pulses quickened around the country this week when a Boston newspaper wrote that Governor Reagan intended to use the July 21 telecast to announce his open candidacy . But one of his aides in Sacramento said flatly . " that is totally , unequivocally false . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Topeka , Kan. , explained it wo n't be an announcement , but his Indianapolis speech . And it will sign off with a plea for listeners to urge convention delegates from their states to remember Mr. Reagan at Miami . One California Republican close to the Governor says the Indianapolis speech " may be the Governor 's best speech this year . " Reagan backers in Topeka think , replayed nationally , it could help keep the front-running Richard M. Nixon from being nominated on the first ballot in Miami . Advertising planned " The reading we get back , " one spokesman there says , " is that many delegates leaning toward Nixon are n't leaning that way anymore . He is out twisting arms to get delegates . If he has 800 votes locked up , as he claims , why is he doing that ? We guess he is still 150 to 175 votes short of what he needs to he nominated . " Those who are circulating Reagan recall petitions at home , on the other hand , insist they have enough names already to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signatures of 780,414 registered voters . Edwin Koupal , cochairman of the recall move , says , " The recall is a success . We have 700,000 signatures already . By July 31 we will have 1.6 million . " He claims 20,000 petition carriers around the state . In Los Angeles , he says , " four offices are manned and swinging . And 85 people are precincting matching precinct numbers up with petition names ) around the clock in Los Angeles County alone . " The recall committee will mount a four-day " petitionthon " in Los Angeles , San Francisco , and Sacramento beginning July 19 , . the day Governor Reagan leaves for his national speechmaking swing . Advertisements bearing petitions will run simultaneously in newspapers in each city . All petitions eventually must go via county registrars of voters to the secretary of state in Sacramento . So far the secretary of state has only 52 authenticated signatures . That does n't mean the necessary 780,414 wo n't arrive by deadline July 31 . Petitions have a way of arriving in bunches at deadline time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60-70 percent of all signatures collected by volunteers usually turn out to be valid . If so , and the recall drive produces 1.6 million names as it predicts , there would be more than enough , after invalid names are winnowed out , to put the issue on the ballot . It would be the first time that a California governor faced recall . Petition bearers have made a run at other governors in the past , but never got far . Mr. Reagan 's predecessor , Democrat Edmund G. Brown , was threatened with recall three times . None of the moves ever amounted to much . ( Mr. Brown himself has signed one of the Reagan recall petitions . ) The Reagan recall effort is the most serious ever mounted against a statewide officer in California . The best that recallers have been able to do in the past is unseat city councilmen and mayors . On two occasions whole city councils in Pasadena and Long Beach have been recalled . And Los Angeles has kicked out two mayors in its day .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
