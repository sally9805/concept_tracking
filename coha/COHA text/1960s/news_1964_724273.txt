txt Despite Barry Goldwater 's talk of ending Federal farm subsidies and Hubert Humphrey 's answering cry that such a step would mean a " death sentence " for agriculture , the Republican Presidential candidate may reap a plump harvest of farm votes this autumn in the Great Plains states . Even if he loses considerable GOP support elsewhere , Sen. Goldwater now stands to hang onto most of the rural vote in the traditionally Republican terrain stretching from Montana . the Dakotas and Minnesota down through Kansas , Wyoming and Colorado . And the farmoriented electorate still bulks big enough to tip the balance in many of these states . This prospect emerges from Wall Street Journal interviews with scores of farm voteis in this land of cattle , wheat and sugar beets Their testimony suggests that Republican switching to Democrat Johnson is running much less strong hereabouts than in most of the U.S. ? perhaps less strong than anywhere except the South , where it seems almost negligible . And LBJ needs to pick up considerable GOP strength to achieve victory in this Great Plains region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most Republican farmers doubt Mr. Goldwater could end farm aid against Con ' eressional resistance or could make things . arse for rural pocketbooks than they already are . " I do n't like Goldwater much , but I 'll stick with the Republicans , " says Harold Schmidt , who farms near Riverton , Wyo . " It looks like a tossup to inc as to who would be better for farmers " Adds Keith Kimball , who raises sugar beets near Hysharn . Mont. : " Farmers are fed up with Government fat in programs , anyway . " Non-Farm IsNites In most rural minds , moreover , non-farm considerations are dominant . Many conservative-leaning GOP farmers plan to string along with Barry because they feel he would hold down the growth of Federal power . " I 'm for anybody who 'll stop the trend toward socialism , " says Ed Murray , a Manhattan , Kan. , cattleman and wheat producer . Many farmers say they suspect President Johnson is a wheeler-dealer involved in possibly still unrevealed scandals , as well as in the Bobby Baker and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between now and Election Day , however . A good many farmers . including a number of past Republican voters , seem to be on the fence so far . Oliver Wold , a Roseau . Minn. , farmer , likes Mr. Goldwater but says he 's hesitating about how to vote . " I 'm still just listening , " asserts noncommittal . Gaylord Brunckhorst , a rancher at Big Timber , Mont . Near Lander . Wyo .. rancher Sandy Mills nods agreement to the words of his neighbor , Riley Lockard : " There 's lots of talk about politics , but it sounds 50.50 right now . A lot of us just do n't know how we 'll vote . " Sen. Goldwater seems to be making few inroads so far among rural Democrats in this region . Many of these contend that even if President Johnson has n't done much for farmers lately , they would rather have LBJ 's finger on the nuclear trigger . " I 'm disgusted the present wheat program , but that other felloW ( Goldwater ) ... and that atomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sian , a Democrat who produces alfalfa , wheat and cattle on 800 irrigated acres near Pompey 's Pillar , Mont. : " You have to think of the country first and the way you earn your living second . " Echoes Democrat Bryan Patrick , a big rancher at Torrington , Wyo. : " That cattle prices were down so long is beside the point . Goldwater would have us in a war within a year . " Climbing Cattle Prices Others figure . though . that the recent recovery in cattle prices , lifting them some 10r ; above year-ago levels , has helped quell farmbelt worries about beef imports and averted some Demcicratic defections . " The meat import problem was the one farm issue ranchers were getting steamed up about , " wistfully says lifelong Republican W. D. ( Bill ) Farr , operator of a Colorado crop and cattle empire 50 miles north of Denver . " But the Democrats neutralized that with the meat import control bill and Government purchases of surplus beef . " By and large , though , agriculture remains an economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic " ins . " The Government 's index of prices received by farmers , at 236 in mid-September , stood significantly below the 242 reading of a year earlier and far below the record 313 touched in 1951 . Meantime , farmers ' costs remain near record heights . Even though Government payments to farmers may run at an unprecedented $2.2 billion or more this year . net farm income is expected to sag below last year 's none  --  toorobust $12.5 billion . Main reasons : Reduced cattle prices and lower earnings from wheat and cotton . Yet if their pocketbooks should continue to suffer , as some expect , a number of farmers reason that LBJ &; Co. would be more willing to rush to the rescue . " Things are going to et worse before they get better , " gloomily phtlicts Democrat William Brewer , a rancher near Casper , Wyo . " But they 're going to have to come around to us sometime ; people have to eat . " For one reason or another , President Johnson does figure to score relatively high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the corn , hog and dairy country east of the Great Plains . Wall Street Journal spotchecks suggest the Democratic ticket will do better than average among farmers in Minne. sota , Mr. Humphrey 's home state . Agriculture Secretary Freeman 's aides in Washington , naturally crediting Democratic farm policies . like to point to polls favoring Mr. Johnson in Minnesota . Iowa and Wisconsin and to more fragmentary pro-Democratic reports from Missouri , Illinois and Ohio . But in some of the Midwest states . rural strength can easily be outweighed by the growing urban-suburban vote ; here in the uncitified Great Plains , the farmer 's ballot tends to count for more . And while the Plains lacks great masses of voters , there 's a bloc of seven states here that boasts enough electoral votes to swing a close election ; all seven went for Richard Nixon in 1960 . Furthermore , there are scattered signs that the Johnson tide may have passed its peak in some states that have been reported leaning toward LBJ . A new poll by three South Dakota newspapers , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " from 68% of the vote in that state during September . while Mr. Goldwater 's share rose to 30% from 28% and the undecided vote to 12% from 4Ci . While this finding scarcely proves the GOP nominee will overtake LBJ 's lead , Democratic farm policy-makers find little comfort in the trend this poll suggests or in the widespread notion among rural voters that neither party is going to do much for farmers . " It wo n't make a nickel 's worth of difference who 's elected President " says Democrat Ralph Ikes. who raises sugar beets near the farm marketing and processing center of Billings . A number of Republicans echo his thought . To understand why Federal farm activity seems to have lost much of its appeal in the plp , ns , consider some " for instances " : Although the issue has lost some of its heat . a number of cattlemen still recall unhappily that the Government did n't do much to bolster sagging cattle prices in 1963 and early this year : until Congress passed the beef import control bill last summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying of " surplus " beef . Wheat growers are railing at present planting controls as " too complicated , " and they are griping because Government price supports . and thus income from bread grain marketings , are lower this year than last , Sugar beet growers in the irrigated regions of Montana , Wyoming and Colorado are boiling because they face a cutback in permitted plantings next year in order to prevent excess production . And there 's a general weariness of operating under Government checkrein of all kinds . Included are the prohibition against use of soil bank land for grazing , limits on amounts of Federally stored water which each farmer may use for irrigating crops , and even the price-propping feed-grain program which holds prices high enough to irk cattlemen but too low to suit many producers of corn , barley , oats and grain sorghums . " I sure do n't like farm programs the way they are , " complains Republic= Duane Beeson , cattle and grain producer of Burlington . Colo . " I 'd just like to get away from the controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what be wants on his own land and take his chances . " Democrat Douglas Stark of Laverne , Minn. , grumbles that " we ought to get the cost of production out of Government programs . but we 're not getting it on grains . " Still , few farm voters want to kill off Federal protection entirely , and some Democrats claim fear of losing Government help will turn many rural Republicans against Mr. Goldwater by Election Day- Anders Thorkildson , a Stephen , Minn. , wheat grower , contends many who voted for Richard Nixon in 1960 will switch to the Democrats even though " farm programs are a little bit crippled up . " Farmer Sherman Guston of Fort Washakie , Wyo. , asserts : " Goldwater never voted for anything for farmers . So I think a lot of Republicans will vote Democratic this time . " Maybe so . But a wide-ranging canvass of Great Plains voters fails to unearth any swarm of GOP deserters so far .                 @ @ @ @
