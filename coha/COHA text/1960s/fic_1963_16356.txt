RUE CASANOVA  --  NIGHT It is a mean , narrow street just off Les Halles , and the prostitutes are out on their love patrol . There are about twenty of them , in full war paint . Some are stalking their prey along the sidewalk , others have stationed themselves in doorways , waiting in ambush . We are now concentrating on a middle-aged , middle-class customer , who is walking down the street casing the merchandise . The floozies try to attract his attention , but he 's not buying . CAMERA MOVES IN on one particular broad stationed beside the dimly-lit entrance of a small hotel . She is a brunnette in her middle-twenties , wearing a black sweater , tight skirt buttoned down the front , and green stockings . A cigarette dangles from her lips , and there is a certain bored sexiness about her . An added attraction is the tiny dog which she cradles in her arm  --  a white toy poodle with a rakish green bow in its hair . The dog starts barking . The customer stops , looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pats the poodle . He 's a dog-lover . He 's a girl-lover , too . He asks her a frank question  --  a ten-franc question . Irma nods , flips her cigarette away , leads him into the hotel . There is no doorman , no bellhop  --  for nobody ever spends a whole night there . CAMERA MOVES UP the shabby facade of the hotel . DISSOLVE TO : HOTEL ROOM  --  NIGHT A dingy cubicle , most of it taken up by a brass bed . Irma is sitting on the edge of the bed , a cigarette in her mouth again , pulling on a green stocking . Beside her is the poodle . The CUSTOMER is putting on his coat . &nbsp; CUSTOMERTell me  --  how did a nice girl like you get into a racket like this ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEWell , actually , I was studying at the Paris Conservatory  --  I was going to be a concert pianist  --  Chopin , Debussy , and like that . Then , the night of my first recital  --  the piano cover fell on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , wiggles her fingers stiffly . The customer has taken some bills out of his wallet , and is putting them in Irma 's open bag , which is resting on a table . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE --  three broken fingers and a broken dream . After that I did n't care what happened to me  --  as long as I could feed myself  --  and my little dog  --  She picks up the poodle . The customer , quite touched , puts an extra bill in Irma 's bag . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( without even looking ) Thank you . DISSOLVE TO : ANOTHER ROOM AT THE HOTEL CASANOVA  --  NIGHT Just as dingy , but different wallpaper , a different arrangement of furniture , and a different customer . This time the man is at the basin , washing up , while Irma sits on the edge of the bed , fixing her makeup . The poodle is lying beside her . &nbsp; SECOND CUSTOMERDo you mind if I ask you a personal question ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEYou mean  --  why does a girl like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , actually , I 'm a Belgian . My parents were missionaries in the Congo  --  ( a catch in her voice )  --  but I do n't want to talk about that . &nbsp; SECOND CUSTOMER ( sympathetically ) I understand . He drops some bills in her handbag . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCESo now there 's just me and my sister  --  she 's in the hospital  --  needs three transfusions a day  --  you know how much a pint of blood costs these days ? ( customer drops in another bill ) Thank you . DISSOLVE TO : STILL ANOTHER ROOM AT THE HOTEL CASANOVA  --  DAWN BY NOW Irma , the ever-present cigarette in her mouth , is adjusting her clothes in front of a clouded mirror . A third customer , a tall tourist from Texas , is sitting on edge of the bed , putting on his fancy boots . He picks up his tengallon hat , shakes out the poodle , which has crawled inside  --  4  --  &nbsp; THIRD CUSTOMERSorry , pooch.

( he drops a bill into her bag ) Actually , I do n't even know my real name  --  you see , I was brought up in an orphanage  --  near Cherbourg . It was destroyed on D-Day  --  and I 've been sending money every week to help rebuild it  --  I 've already paid for a whole wing . The Texan takes the rest of his money out of his pocket , drops it in her bag . &nbsp; THIRD CUSTOMERThat 's all I have on me , ma'am . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEActually , it was bombed by the Eighth Air Force  --  not that I blame you Americans . But if you could see those poor orphans  --  sleeping on the floor , the rain coming in  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; THIRD CUSTOMER ( reaching into his pocket ) Do you all take traveller 's checks ? FADE OUT : Section Details STREET ON TOP OF MONTMARTRE  --  DAWN A street-cleaner is sweeping yesterday 's refuse along the gutter . Suddenly he stops , looks down , a sentimental smile on his face . Drawn on the cobblestones , in red chalk , are two intertwined hearts . He muses over them for a moment , then unsentimentally sweeps some water from the gutter across the hearts . The water turns red as it flows into a sewer . &nbsp; NARRATOR 'S VOICEThis , then , is the story of Irma La Douce . A story of passion , bloodshed , desire and death . Everything , in fact , that makes life worth living . CAMERA PANS UP Revealing the city spread out below . &nbsp; NARRATOR 'S VOICEThe place is Paris  --  the time is five o'clock in the morning .  --  5  --  ETOILE From high above we see the Arc de Triomphe  --  stolid , massive , lonely . No cars , no pedestrians  --  just three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NARRATOR 'S VOICEYou may have read in travel folders that Paris is a city that never sleeps . Do n't believe it . RUE DE LA PAIX A water-wagon , the sprinklers going full blast , is moving down the empty street toward the Place Vendome . &nbsp; NARRATOR 'S VOICEAt this time of the day , there 's nothing doing  --  unless you 're working for the Department of Sanitation . PLACE DE LA CONCORDE The big , deserted square lies in gray slumber . We move over to MAXIM 'S , in the Rue Royale . It is dark inside . A kitchen-helper is setting out the garbage cans , while a janitor is hosing off the sidewalk . &nbsp; NARRATOR 'S VOICEIf you want a night-cap at Maxim 's , it 's too late  --  it 's been closed for hours . EIFFEL TOWER The steel structure is outlined against the awakening sky . &nbsp; NARRATOR 'S VOICEIf you want to jump off the Eiffel Tower , it 's too early  --  it wo n't be open for hours . PONT ALEXANDRE III There is no traffic except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to early Mass . The lights on the bridge go out . &nbsp; NARRATOR 'S VOICESo if you 're looking for a little action , forget the high rent district , and come to our neighborhood . LES HALLES The citadel of food  --  all kinds of food  --  food everywhere you look  --  pavilions full of food , truckloads of food , sidewalks piled with food  --  food in crates , food in barrels , food in baskets  --  and through this labyrinth of food , people scurrying like ants , loading and unloading , buying and selling . &nbsp; NARRATOR 'S VOICEThis is Les Halles  --  the wholesale  --  6  --  food market .

This is where the girls are  --  or as we say , the poules . You can have your choice of Kiki the Cossack , Amazon Annie , Lolita , Suzette Wong , Mimi the Maumau  --  Out of the Hotel Casanova comes Irma , with poodle , and her Texas customer . He tips his hat and wanders off . Irma starts across the street . &nbsp; NARRATOR 'S VOICEAnd then , of course , there 's Irma La Douce . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck behind the fish market . Like all the other poules , she takes her coffee break in the bistro across the street . Irma enters the bistro . A neon sign reads CHEZ MOUSTACHE  --  BAR  --  TABAC.  --  7  --  BISTRO The place is crowded with floozies and other local characters . Everything is going  --  the jukebox , the pinball machine , a billiard match , and a couple of card games . At one of the tables , incongruously enough , a few people in evening clothes are eating onion soup . Behind the bar is MOUSTACHE , a portly man of sixty , with the face of a debauched choir boy . He wears a bar apron and an imposing mustache , and is pouring a drink for a customer . &nbsp; NARRATOR 'S VOICEThis is the owner  --  he 's known as Moustache . According to the police records , he 's a Rumanian chicken thief named Constantinescu . But when he bought this place it was already called Chez Moustache , and naturally it was cheaper to grow a mustache than to buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where Irma is waiting , hands her a pack of Gitanes . She wanders off toward the back room , passing the group in evening clothes . &nbsp; NARRATOR 'S VOICESometimes , at dawn , rich slummers drop in for a bowl of onion soup . But mostly , the clientele consists of the poules and their mecs . In the back room , four young men in loud suits and with their hats on , are engaged in a game of three-ball billiards . HIPPOLYTE , a flashily dressed six-foot-six lug with a gold front tooth , is shooting . Irma stops to watch .  --  8  --  &nbsp; NARRATOR 'S VOICEYou know what a mec is  --  how do you say it in English ?  --  a protector , a consort , a business manager  --  stick around , you 'll get the idea . Irma has taken out a cigarette and JOJO , a small weasly pimp with one arm , jumps up from a table to light it for her . Hippolyte misses a shot , tosses his cue to Jojo , removes the lit cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEHow are we doing ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCENot bad . ( opens her handbag ) Mostly tips . I had some real pigeons tonight . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTE ( taking money out of handbag ) Sometimes I wish you were twins . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( drily ) Thanks . Hippolyte kisses her on the neck , notices something tucked in her cleavage . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEWhat 's that ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEWhat 's what ? ( he reaches down , pulls out a folded piece of paper ) Oh , that . The last one did n't have any more money  --  so he gave me a traveller 's check . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTE ( sweetly ) Now is that nice , Irma  --  holding out on me ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEIt 's only ten dollars . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEAnd you were n't going to tell me about it ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEI was going to put it down as a deposit  --  on a hair-dryer  --  &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEA hair-dryer ? We 're partners , Irma  --  you would n't want to cheat me ? With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twists it around her back . This seems to be normal procedure , since none of the other mecs pay attention . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCELet go , Hippolyte . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTE ( tightening the pressure ) There 's such a thing as ethics , you know . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEYou 're hurting me , you big ox .  --  9  --  &nbsp; HIPPOLYTE ( another twist ) If you do n't like the way I treat you , why do n't you get yourself another guy ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( tears in her eyes ) I will , one of these days . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEWhy wait ? Why do n't you leave me now ? Jojo looks up from the billiard game . &nbsp; JOJOI 'd take her , anytime . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEOh , you would ! Abruptly he lets go of Irma , grabs Jojo by his shirt-front . &nbsp; JOJOIt was just a joke , Hippolyte . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEA joke ? So how come nobody 's laughing ? He lifts him off his feet , tosses him across the bistro like a cigarette but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Moustache picks up a siphon of seltzer-water , expertly aims a spritz at Jojo , who is sprawled unconscious on the floor . The water hits Jojo 's face , and he stirs . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTE ( to Irma ) Now go back to work . ( he slaps her on the behind ) . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( moving off ) Ox ! As she goes out the door , past Jojo who is leaning groggily against the wall , a POLICE SERGEANT comes into the bistro . &nbsp; NARRATOR 'S VOICEAnd so it 's one big happy family around here  --  the mecs , the poules , and the flics  --  or as you would say , the cops . The Sergeant walks up to the bar , takes off his cap , puts it down on the stool beside him . Moustache automatically pours him a Pernod . &nbsp; NARRATOR 'S VOICEYour statesmen and politicians , they keep talking about peaceful coexistence . But here , in our milieu , we really practice it . The attitude of the police is live and let live  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . While the Sergeant is sipping his drink , facing away from his cap , the mecs file by the bar , one by one , and drop some franc notes into the upturned cap .  --  10  --  &nbsp; NARRATOR 'S VOICEEvery other Friday , the flics would raid the Rue Casanova  --  just for the record . A few poules would be hauled to the station  --  they 'd pay a small fine  --  and twenty-four hours later , they 'd be back on the street . The Sergeant finishes his Pernod , without paying a sou , deftly puts on his cap , without spilling a sou , leaves with a jovial wave . &nbsp; NARRATOR 'S VOICEIt was a nice , friendly , civilized arrangement  --  everybody looked the other way , everybody kept his mouth shut , nobody got hurt . During this , Moustache has been stalking a fly with a swatter . Now he slaps it viciously . &nbsp; NARRATOR 'S VOICEExcept maybe an occasional fly . Moustache neatly sweeps the dead fly off the bar . DISSOLVE TO :  --  11  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambling between the stalls . His name is NESTOR PATOU . He is naive , wide-eyed , and there is an engaging grin on his face . Pinned to the tunic of his uniform is a medal , and from the way he twirls his baton one gathers that he is very proud of his exalted position . All in all , he looks like Little Red Riding Hood strolling through the forest . &nbsp; NARRATOR 'S VOICEAnd then one day  --  disaster ! An honest policeman came on the beat . Stopping in front of a fruit stand , the honest one picks a shiny red apple out of a box . The proprietor smiles at him . Nestor now takes a small change purse out of his pocket , opens it , fishes out a coin , hands it to the proprietor . He saunters off , eating the apple and twirling his baton . The proprietor looks after him , open-mouthed . RUE AVENUE  --  MORNING Nestor turns into the street of vice , munching on his apple and knowing from nothing . As he passes the patrolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile back . Seems like a very friendly neighborhood . But gradually , it begins to dawn on him that something is not quite kosher  --  the skin-tight dresses and the split skirts , the heavy makeup and the swiveling hips . One girl who attracts his attention is a post-graduate Lolita , in heart-shaped dark glasses , who is standing in a doorway blowing bubble gum . Another poule has a pair of tassels attached to her bodice . Nestor walks on , the grin on his face giving way to a pensive frown . Suddenly Irma 's poodle comes dashing across the sidewalk , starts yipping at his heels . As Nestor tries to shoo it away , Irma , cigarette in mouth , approaches from her doorway . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCECome here , Coquette. ( picks up poodle ) Naughty girl . &nbsp; PATOU ( studies Irma , then salutes ) Pardon me , mademoiselle  --  do you have a license ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( that 's a new one ) A license ? No . &nbsp; PATOUIt 's a violation of Ordinance Number 56 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us get away with it  --  &nbsp; PATOUNot me . And another thing  --  according to the  --  12  --  law , you 're supposed to keep it on a leash . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEOn a leash ? ( a glance at Coquette ) Oh , of course . I 'll remember that . ( she starts to move away ) &nbsp; PATOUJust a moment . ( Irma turns ) What are all you girls doing around here  --  at this hour of the morning ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEI do n't know about them  --  I 'm just walking my dog . &nbsp; PATOUI see . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEI have to take her out all the time . She 's got kidney stones . &nbsp; PATOUThat 's a shame . ( glancing down ) Look , if you do n't mind my saying so  --  ( whispers in her ear ) &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEOh . I 'm sorry . ( she fastens the bottom buttons of her skirt ) &nbsp; PATOUYou know , I 've never seen a girl in green stockings before . &nbsp; IRMA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and my underwear . &nbsp; PATOUGreen underwear ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCESay , you 're new around here , are n't you ? &nbsp; PATOUIt 's my first day . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEI thought so . &nbsp; PATOUOh , I 've been on the police force for six months  --  I was stationed in the Bois de Boulogne  --  you know , by the lake  --  where the children play ? ( pointing ) That 's how I got the medal . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEFor keeping the kids off the grass ? &nbsp; PATOUNo  --  I saved a little boy from drowning  --  mouth-to-mouth respiration . So they thought I was ready for bigger things , and transferred me here . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEYou 're going to like it here . &nbsp; PATOUI 'm not so sure . ( confidentially ) You know , if I were you , I 'd exercise that dog somewhere else . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEWhy ?  --  13  --  &nbsp; PATOUThose girls over there  --  something tells me they 're streetwalkers . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCENo ! &nbsp; PATOUYes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee , still in his work-clothes , comes hurrying up along the sidewalk . His name is ANDRE . &nbsp; ANDRESay , Irma  --  I just got off work  --  so I thought if you 're not busy  --  &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( giving him a blank look ) I beg your pardon ? &nbsp; ANDREIrma , it 's me  --  Andre  --  wholesale artichokes . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEI do n't need any . &nbsp; ANDREWhat 's the matter with you , Irma ? You want me to take my business to Kiki the Cossack ? &nbsp; PATOU ( to Irma ) Is is man annoying you ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCENo , it 's all right . ( to Andre , out of the corner of her mouth ) Not now . Come back later . &nbsp; ANDRE ( sotto voice ) Later ? I only got half an hour  --  ( a desperate idea ; turns to Nestor ) Look , officer , there 's a truck double-parked there . Why do n't you do your duty ? &nbsp; PATOU ( his suspicion aroused ) Maybe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He takes his work very seriously . &nbsp; PATOUI try . ( he salutes , turns away ) &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( to Nestor ) See you again sometime . &nbsp; PATOUI would n't be surprised .  --  14  --  He starts across the street , then glances back casually over his shoulder . Sure enough , Irma and Andre are entering the Hotel Casanova . Nestor looks after them for a moment , then marches into Chez Moustache . BISTRO The crowd has thinned out somewhat , the mecs are still at the billiard table , and a few of the poules are hanging around . Nestor makes his way to the bar , seats himself strategically so that he can observe the entrance of the Hotel Casanova through the window . He removes his cap , puts it down on the stool beside him , as Moustache comes up on the other side of the counter . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEWhat 'll it be , officer ? Cognac ? &nbsp; PATOUNo , no  --  I never drink while I 'm on duty . As a matter of fact , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small glass of Vichy water . As Moustache pours him the Vichy water , Nestor 's eyes wander back toward the hotel entrance . &nbsp; MOUSTACHELooking for something officer ? &nbsp; PATOUWhat do you know about that hotel ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHECasanova slept there in 1763 . &nbsp; PATOUI 'm not talking about 1763 . Just since I 've been sitting here , four couples walked in there . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEMonday is always a slow night . &nbsp; PATOUJust between us , do you have even a vague idea of what they 're doing in there ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHEI have a very definite idea . They 're making love . &nbsp; PATOUThat 's illegal . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEShows you the kind of world we live in . Love is illegal  --  but not hate . That you can do anywhere , anytime , to anybody . But if you want a little warmth , a little tenderness  --  a shoulder to cry on , a smile to cuddle up with  --  you have to hide in dark corners , like a criminal . Pfui ! &nbsp; PATOUI would n't call that love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; PATOUIt 's flagrant vice , and it must be stamped out . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEMy dear boy  --  your thinking is not only fuzzy , it 's economically unsound . And I know what I 'm talking about . I used to be a professor of economics at the Sorbonne . &nbsp; PATOUA professor ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHEFor six years . But that 's another story . &nbsp; PATOUThen you must agree with me that decent citizens have a right to be protected against  --  &nbsp; MOUSTACHEAll right  --  let 's take a decent citizen  --  married for twenty years  --  works hard all day selling baby carriages . In the evening , he wants a little fun , a little companionship . So he comes to the Rue Casanova  --  he meets a girl  --  she gives him a little companionship , he gives her a little money . The girl gives the money to her boyfriend  --  the boyfriend spends it on drinks , on cuff links , at the race-track  --  Moustache glances off in the direction of the mecs , who by this time , behind Nestor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; MOUSTACHE --  sometimes he even pays a little money to a policeman . &nbsp; PATOUBribe a policeman ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHEThat 's the beauty of it . Because the policeman takes the money and buys a baby carriage from the decent citizen . Thusly , money is kept in circulation  --  everybody 's prosperous , everybody 's happy . &nbsp; PATOUI do n't believe it . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEIt 's elementary . &nbsp; PATOUI do n't believe there are policemen who take money . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEOh , not all policemen take money . Some of the higher-ups have a more intimate arrangement with the girls . &nbsp; PATOUWell , there 's one policeman around here who is n't corrupt .  --  16  --  He rises , puts on his cap , without realizing that it 's lined with money by now . He starts toward the wall phone , stops . &nbsp; PATOUYou would n't know the number of the police station , would you ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHECentral 52-88 . But I would n't be so impetuous if I were you . Have your Vichy . Ignoring him , Nestor inserts a coin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Desk Sergeant ? This is Officer Patou . I want a police van sent immediately to the Hotel Casanova  --  a violation of Section 34 of the Criminal Code . . . No , not littering the sidewalk  --  that 's Section 43 . This is lewd and immoral conduct  --  ( reacting to something off-scene ) There goes another couple ! I 'm going to raid the place . He hangs up , returns to the bar . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEYou 're asking for trouble , my young friend . To be overly honest in a dishonest world is like plucking a chicken against the wind . You 'll only wind up with a mouthful of feathers . During this , Nestor has taken out his change purse , and paid for the Vichy . &nbsp; PATOUDo n't worry , old man . I know what I 'm doing . He starts out immediately , twirling his baton  --  then stops suddenly , realizing he does n't have his baton . He turns back to the bar . A smiling Moustache is standing there , holding the baton out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks after him , stroking his mustache thoughtfully . LOBBY  --  HOTEL CASANOVA It 's tiny and shabby . Behind the desk is a scrawny concierge , reading a newspaper . Nestor crosses the street from the bistro , and barging into the lobby , bangs his baton on the desk . &nbsp; PATOUDo you have a fire alarm here ? &nbsp; CONCIERGE ( looking up ) Yes , officer . In perfect work-order.  --  17  --  He points to a small , glass-enclosed alarm box beside the desk . Nestor breaks the glass with his baton , pushes the button . The alarm bell goes off piercingly . &nbsp; CONCIERGE ( in a panic ) Where 's the fire ? Nestor takes a match from the match-holder on the desk , strikes it , ignites the newspaper in the concierge 's hands . &nbsp; PATOURight here . As the concierge beats out the flame , there comes from upstairs the sound of doors being opened and an excited babble of voices  --  the alarm is evidently taking effect . Tearing down the stairs comes Coquette , the poodle . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; PATOUOh , no you do n't ! You 're under arrest ! Piling down the stairs now are girls and their customers , in various stages of dress and undress .

Girls on this side  --  men over here ! &nbsp; LOLITAWhat is this ? &nbsp; PATOUA raid . &nbsp; LOLITAOn a Monday ? It 's supposed to be every other Friday . More couples are trooping down the stairs , and everybody is milling around excitedly as Nestor tries to separate the poules from their customers . &nbsp; SUZETTE WONG ( a hooker from Hanoi ) Can I go back up and get my stockings ? &nbsp; PATOUNo ! Come on , come on . &nbsp; AMAZON ANNIE ( holding on to one of the men ) Well , at least you ought to pay me half  --  it was n't my fault . &nbsp; FIRST MAN ( to Nestor ) I do n't know what she 's talking about .

( takes out his wallet ) &nbsp; PATOUOh , trying to bribe an officer , huh ? From the street , there is the wail of an approaching police van . RUE CASANOVA The police van is just drawing up in front of the hotel . Two policemen hop down , and open the rear doors . Nestor emerges from the lobby , holds off the crowd of curious onlookers who are gathering .  --  19  --  &nbsp; PATOUBack . Everybody back . ( calling inside ) Okay , ladies  --  let 's go .

Out of the bistro across the street appear Moustache and several of the mecs , billiard cues in their hands . Irma is now approaching the van , cigarette in her mouth . &nbsp; PATOUJust a minute . No smoking in a police van . He jerks the cigarette out of her mouth , tosses it away . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEJust who do you thing you are ? DeGaulle ? &nbsp; PATOUInside . The mecs are watching the girls being loaded into the van . &nbsp; JOJOWhat do they expect us to do now  --  collect unemployment insurance ? &nbsp; HIPPOLYTE ( tossing a billiard ball in his hand ) It 's that new flic . One of these days I 'm going to catch him out of uniform , and then  --  Closing his fingers around the billiard ball , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poules has been loaded into the van . &nbsp; PATOU ( to the other two policemen ) Let 's go . As the policemen head for the front of the van , Nestor notices something lying in the gutter , picks it up . It 's a brassiere . &nbsp; PATOUWho does this belong to ? He tosses it into the van , climbs in with the girls , shuts the door after him . The van takes off . &nbsp; pp. 20-34 POLICE VAN It 's jampacked with poules  --  some sitting on the benches along the sides , the rest standing . Nestor leans against the rear door , his arms folded , a stern expression on his face . It 's all very confined and trying .

STREET As the speeding police van approaches an intersection , a small car darts out of the side street . At the last moment , the driver of the van swerves to avoid a collision . POLICE VAN The sudden swerve throws everybody in the van off balance . Nestor goes sprawling into the laps of the seated poules , and some of the other girls fall on top of him . He disappears from view under the pile-up of screaming , screeching poules . EXTERIOR POLICE STATION The police van draws up in front of the station . The two policemen stationed at the entrance open the rear door of the van . The sight that greets them is a mound of writhing female bodies . They disengage the girls one by one , unloading them from the van and shooing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of the pile , somewhat the worse for wear , his uniform in complete disarray .

POLICE STATION It 's a gloomy place , with discolored walls , a few desks , a booking counter , and a wire detention cage . The policemen are herding the poules into the cage .

The phone rings and the Sergeant picks it up . Nestor crosses to the cage . All the poules have been locked in , including Irma . There is standing room only . &nbsp; PATOU ( to Irma , through the wire ) About the little one  --  ( indicating Coquette )  --  do n't worry  --  we 'll feed her around here . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEBut none of that horsemeat you give to the police dogs .

He indicates a door beyond the cage , with a sign on it : J. J. LEFEVRE , Inspecteur de la Police . Nestor crosses to it , straightening out his disheveled uniform as well as he can . One button is missing . He knocks and there is a booming " Come in ! " from inside . Nestor enters . INSPECTOR 'S OFFICE In the small old-fashioned office , the INSPECTOR , his back to CAMERA , is bent over a wash-basin , rinsing his hands . He is wearing a black bowler . Nestor comes in , snaps to attention , salutes . The Inspector turns around slowly . Nestor 's mouth opens , and his salute drops to half-mast . Inspector Lefevre is the authoritative customer Nestor accused of trying to bribe him in the lobby of the Hotel Casanova . They  --  25  --  just look at each other  --  Nestor resuming a quivering salute , and the Inspector drying his hands . &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVRE ( surprisingly benign ) So you 're the new man in our outfit ? &nbsp; PATOUYes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you looked like . &nbsp; PATOUOh , you 've seen me before . &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVREI have ? &nbsp; PATOUDo n't you remember ?

It 's disgraceful ! &nbsp; PATOUWell , there were sixteen of them in the van  --  and they were resisting arrest  --  and I was resisting , too  --  I did n't lose my head  --  only my gun  --  but I got it back  --  &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVREAnd take off your cap when you 're addressing your superior ! &nbsp; PATOUYes , sir . He lifts his cap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mecs had deposited in his cap . A few bills swirl down gently past Nestor 's face . He has no idea where the money comes from . He looks up .

FADE OUT :  --  26  --  Section Details RUE CASANOVA '  --  NIGHT It is raining . The poules are on patrol again  --  in plastic raincoats , galoshes , carrying umbrellas . But in this kind of weather , customers are scarce . Down the street comes a man , and there is a hopeful stir among the girls . The collar of his suit is turned up against the rain , he is hatless , and he carries a small cardboard suitcase . As he comes closer , we see it is Nestor  --  a civilian by now .

Nestor pays no attention . Reaching the entrance of Chez Moustache , he looks in , then enters . It is very quiet . A few poules are sitting around , and at a table in the back , the mecs , with their hats on , are engaged in a game of belotte . Moustache is behind the bar , playing dice with himself . He looks up as Nestor comes in . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEA small glass of Vichy , right ? &nbsp; PATOUCognac , please .

I was a Colonel in the Foreign Legion  --  &nbsp; PATOUWas that before or after you were a professor of economics ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHENo , in between I was a croupier in Monte Carlo .

( glancing at his suitcase ) Besides , they do n't take anybody with luggage . On the bar , Coquette whines . At the card table , Hippolyte recognizes the whine , looks up . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEIrma ! ( he beckons to her ) Irma crosses from the bar to the table .  --  30  --  &nbsp; HIPPOLYTE ( snapping his fingers ) Let 's have it . Irma opens her handbag , and he reaches in and takes out a couple of bills . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEIs that all ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEIt 's the weather .

You ought to try it . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( drily ) And how about long underwear ? &nbsp; PATOUBy all means . I also used to put an old newspaper inside my coat  --  to keep my chest warm . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCELook , mister  --  I 'm in a very competitive business . She picks up the tea-cup , takes a couple of quick sips . &nbsp; PATOUWell , you have one advantage  --  at least you get indoors once in a while  --  and off your feet  --  ( catching himself ) I 'm sorry . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEForget it . She takes out a fresh cigarette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts the pack in her bag . &nbsp; PATOUYou really ought to cut down on it . ( Irma gives him a look ) I mean , one after another  --  &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEMind your own business . &nbsp; PATOUWell , if you want to smoke yourself to death  --  &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEOh. ( looking at him oddly ) I 've met fellows who 've asked me to do a lot of crazy things  --  but not to give up smoking . &nbsp; PATOUI did n't mean to get personal . But I like you  --   --  31  --  and when I was living in Dijon , there was this girl I was in love it  --  &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEAnd I remind you of her ? &nbsp; PATOU ( studying her ) As a matter of fact , you do n't look anything like her at all . But she was a heavy smoker  --  sixty cigarettes a day  --  and coughing all the time  --  An angry Hippolyte comes up behind Irma . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEWhat are you hanging around for ? I said out ! &nbsp; PATOU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without even glancing at him , Hippolyte puts a hand on his face , shoves him away . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( to Hippolyte ) All right , all right . We were just talking  --  &nbsp; PATOUAbout smoking . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTE ( to Irma ) Talk on your own time  --  not during working hours . He grabs her arm , twists it behind her back . She winces . &nbsp; PATOUI would strongly advise you to let go of the lady . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTE ( recognizing him ) Oh , it 's you . &nbsp; PATOUI will give you exactly five seconds . ( looks at his watch ) One  --  two  --  three  --  four  --  five  --  ( on the count of five , Hippolyte releases Irma ) That 's better . It really is n't , because Hippolyte lets go with a haymaker that sends Nestor reeling backward until he crashes into the card table . Moustache automatically picks up the siphon , aims a spritz of soda-water across the room . It hits Nestor 's face , revives him . He staggers to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players . Irma is gathering up her poodle and her umbrella . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEAnd do n't come back with any excuses . I need a hundred francs . Nestor has come up behind Hippolyte . He raises the  --  32  --  billiard cue , brings it down with all his might on Hippolyte 's head . The cue splinters , but Hippolyte does n't even blink an eye . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTE ( turning ) Hey , watch it . This is a new hat . ( he takes it off ) &nbsp; PATOUHad enough ? Hippolyte calmly puts his hat on the bar , lets go with another haymaker , sends Nestor sprawling across the billiard table . Another spritz from Moustache revives him . He looks around for a new weapon , picks up a billiard ball , heads unsteadily toward Hippolyte . By this time the other customers are on their feet , watching David vs . Goliath . Nestor comes stalking up to Hippolyte , tossing the billiard ball in his hand . &nbsp; PATOUNow I 'm mad . Now I 'm really mad . And when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIPPOLYTE ( to the other mecs ) Did you hear that , boys ? He 's a tiger ! He turns and laughs uproariously right in Nestor 's face . Nestor takes it for a beat , then shoves the billiard ball smack into Hippolyte 's mouth . Hippolyte coughs , splutters , tries frantically to get the billiard ball out , but ca n't . During all this , Nestor is pummeling away at him . Out on the sidewalk , Lolita becomes aware of the brawl inside the bistro.  --  33  --  &nbsp; LOLITA ( calling ) Hey , girls  --  a fight . The poules gather from all directions , umbrellas bobbing , press up against the window to watch . Hippolyte , backed against the wall , grabs Nestor , tosses him into a table , which collapses . The mecs look on stony-faced , while Irma is rooting silently for Nestor . Nestor gets to his feet , is about to renew the attack , then thinks better of it , turns to Moustache , holds his face out for another spritz . Moustache obliges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the stomach . The impact sends the billiard ball flying out of Hippolyte 's mouth . Nestor forces Hippolyte back onto the billard table , and Hippolyte tosses him over his head , causing the chandelier above to swing crazily . As Hippolyte rises , the chandelier hits him in the head , stunning him . Nestor staggers up , and getting an idea , swings the chandelier in the opposite direction . It clobbers Hippolyte again . Nestor repeats this process several times , till Hippolyte is practically out on his feet . Now all Nestor has to do is push him with one finger , and Hippolyte keels over backward into the pinball machine , bringing it down with him . The glass smashes , the balls roll out , buzzers buzz , bells ring , and the machine lights up like firewords on Bastille Day . The other mecs jump up from the card table . Irma is standing there with a triumphant smile on her face .  --  34  --  Nestor turns , finds himself confronted by the other mecs . &nbsp; PATOU ( challengingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumbers toward him . They stand face to face . Then Charlie grabs Nestor 's hand , and shakes it gratefully . One by one the other pimps step up and pump his hand in congratulations . The last one is Jojo , who throws his one arm around Nestor , kisses him on both cheeks . Nestor brushes them aside nonchalantly , crosses to the bar . &nbsp; PATOU ( to Moustache ) Cognac . ( to Irma ) Would you care for another peppermint tea ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCENo , thank you . ( to Moustache , who has poured the drink ) Put everything on my bill . Moustache nods . Nestor downs the cognac . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( to Nestor ) Shall we go ? &nbsp; PATOU ( blase ) Might as well . I 'm getting bored with this place . He picks up his hat and suitcase , elegantly ushers Irma out of the bistro. pp. 1-19 &nbsp; pp. 35-53 RUE CASANOVA It is still raining . Irma opens her umbrella , leads Nestor down the street , past the hotel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the entrance of a rundown apartment house . Irma presses the concierge 's bell . The door snaps open . Irma steps inside , closing her umbrella . &nbsp; PATOUWhere are we going ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEUp to my apartment . &nbsp; PATOUI thought you lived in the hotel . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEThat 's my business address . Come on  --  you 're getting wet . Nestor follows her in , and the door closes . STAIRCASE OF APARTMENT HOUSE Irma leads Nestor up the dimly-lit staircase , removing Coquette 's raincoat as they climb .  --  35  --  &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCENow do n't expect too much when we get up there . &nbsp; PATOUOh , no  --  not at all . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEI have no rugs  --  and no icebox  --  &nbsp; PATOUJust as long as you have an empty couch . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEAnd no couch . &nbsp; PATOUOh .

An electric blanket . &nbsp; PATOUYou do ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEIt was a present  --  from somebody with the American Embassy . &nbsp; PATOUMust be nice  --  an electric blanket  --  on a night like this . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEOnly it does n't work . They 've got a different kind of electricity there  --  AC or DC or something  --  &nbsp; PATOUToo bad . She unlocks the door to her apartment . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEDo n't worry .

IRMA 'S APARTMENT Irma switches on the light , closes the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slanted skylight and a narrow balcony  --  36  --  beyond it . In the middle of the room is a gaily-painted wrought-iron bed . There is a small bathroom , off . No kitchen  --  just an alcove with a two-burner stove and a table . Another alcove , covered by a curtain , serves as a closet . Several pairs of green stockings have been hung out to dry on wires strung across the window . Irma drops Coquette on the bed , kicks off her shoes , as Nestor looks around . &nbsp; PATOUIt 's very attractive  --  it 's got atmosphere . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( pointing at the skylight ) Used to be a studio  --  a painter once lived here  --  poor guy , he was starving  --  tried everything  --  even cut his ear off  --  &nbsp; PATOUVan Gogh ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCENo , I think his name was Schwartz .

Very good job . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEIt looked just awful when I found it at the Flea Market . She unzips her dress and it falls away . Nestor swallows , looks off . His eyes fall on the rain-streaked skylight , then wander to some newspapers stacked on a chair . &nbsp; PATOUCan I borrow a newspaper ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEYou want to read ? &nbsp; PATOUNo , of course not . ( picks up newspaper ) Can I take your stockings off ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( gesturing toward her legs ) Go ahead . Instead , Nestor turns to the window , pulls down the stockings hanging from the wires , starts to attach sheets of newspaper to the clothes-pins . Irma watches him with amusement , then sits on the bed .  --  37  --  &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEYou really are shy , are n't you ? &nbsp; PATOUMe ? Shy ? ( a feeble smile ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we live in . What I mean is , if you hate somebody , you can do it anytime , any place . But if you like somebody  --  you have to hide out in dark corners . He hangs more sheets of newspaper across the skylight . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( removing stockings ) You know , I 'm sort of glad about that girl in Dijon  --  with the cough  --  &nbsp; PATOUYou are ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEBecause frankly  --  in the police van  --  I thought that you 'd never in your life  --  &nbsp; PATOU ( quickly ) Oh , she was n't the only girl . I 've had more than one girl . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEHow many ? &nbsp; PATOUAltogether ? ( concentrating ) Let me see  --  &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEThree ? &nbsp; PATOUNot as many as that . Irma starts to remove her brassiere . Nestor turns discreetly toward the window , continues to cover it with newspapers . Irma scoots into bed and under the sheets , just her head and naked shoulders showing . She is still smoking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow beside her . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEWhat 's your name ? &nbsp; PATOUNestor . Nestor Patou . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEWell , do n't take all night , Nestor Patou . &nbsp; PATOUI wo n't . He steps away from the window , and undoing his tie , folds it neatly , puts it in his pocket . Then he takes off his coat , drapes it casually over the back of a chair  --  and it falls to the floor . Irma continues smoking , never taking her eyes off him . Nestor , somewhat ill-at-east , turns away , becomes aware that Coquette is watching him . He removes his shirt , is about to put it on the chair , then changes his mind , hangs it over the light fixuture , dimming the room . This gives him a little more courage . He  --  38  --  starts to unbuckle his belt . A side-glance at Irma . She keeps looking at him . &nbsp; PATOUDid n't you say you had a sleeping mask ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( with a knowing smile ) You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bed-table , pulls it over her eyes . Nestor removes his pants . Coquette is staring at him fixedly . He tries to shoo her away . She does n't move . Nestor advances on her slowly . Irma , in bed with the mask over her eyes , is waiting . Suddenly from off comes a series of piercing yelps from Coquette . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( sitting up ) What 's going on ? What are you doing ? THIRD FLOOR LANDING The door of Irma 's apartment opens . Nestor 's bare arm reaches out , unceremoniously dumps Coquette on the doormat . The door closes . The poodle starts whining and scratching at the door . FADE OUT :  --  39  --  Section Details EXTERIOR IRMA 'S APARTMENT HOUSE  --  DAY The rain has stopped , the sun is breaking through the clouds .

Nestor reacts to the voice . Irma crosses to the skylight , tears the newspaper away , opens the glass door and steps out into the balcony . EXTERIOR IRMA 'S APARTMENT HOUSE Irma leans over the railing of the balcony , calls down to Hippolyte in the street below . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEWhat do you want ?  --  40  --  &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEI want to talk to you ! &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEYou go to hell ! &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEI 'm coming up to get my clothes ! &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEJust a minute  --  She steps back into the apartment . IRMA 'S APARTMENT Irma comes in from the balcony , heads for the bathroom . Nestor is sitting up in bed with the bedspread tucked around him . &nbsp; PATOU ( nervously ) Who is it  --  that big ox again ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEUh-huh . She steps into the bathroom , grabs a toothbrush , then crosses to the closet , opens the curtain part way . It is jammed with Hippolyte 's gaudy suits , shirts , hats , ties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes which are old and crummy , pulls out a stringy tie . &nbsp; PATOU ( uneasily ) Look , if you two have something personal to discuss  --  &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEStay right where you are . She steps out on the balcony . EXTERIOR IRMA 'S APARTMENT HOUSE &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCECatch ! She tosses down the tie , the toothbrush , and the shoes . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTE ( picking them up ) What about my suits , and my silk shirts , and my jewelry  --  ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEThis is what you came with , and this is what you 're leaving with . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEWhy , you little  --  &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEYou 're lucky I do n't take back that gold tooth . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEI 'm going to come up there and break your arm ! &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEOh , you are ? ( she turns toward the door ) Tiger ! Come on out , Tiger . She beckons him to join her . Nestor gets out of bed , wraps the bedspread around himself , steps out onto the balcony reluctantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You want my friend here to beat you up again ?  --  41  --  Nestor , playing casual , rests his hand on the iron railing of the balcony  --  almost knocking over a flowerpot attached to it . He grabs the flower pot , holds it up threateningly . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTE ( growling ) You 'll be hearing from me ! He stalks away . &nbsp; PATOU ( after him ; suddenly brave ) And stay away . He replaces the flowerpot as Irma turns back into the apartment . IRMA 'S APARTMENT Nestor follows Irma in from the balcony . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEYou could beat him up again , could n't you ? &nbsp; PATOUNaturally . It 's just that I do n't like to pick on someone who is n't my size . Irma opens the hall door , and Coquette dashes inside . Irma picks up a bottle of milk and a long stick of bread , carries them into the kitchen . &nbsp; PATOUHow did you get mixed up with a character like that , anyway ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEYou should 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean  --  but he used to run around with other women  --  on my money . &nbsp; PATOUWhy do you have to have anybody at all ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEEverybody needs somebody  --  ( pointing at Coquette )  --  like she needs me  --  who wants to be a stray dog ? You 've got to belong to someone  --  even if he kicks you once in a while . She has filled the coffee pot with water , puts it on the stove , lights the burner . Nestor , meanwhile , is putting on his shirt and trousers . &nbsp; PATOUDo n't you have any family ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCENo . My mother was a very successful woman  --  used to have the same spot outside the hotel that I do . Then one day she met a guy and fell in love with him and quit . &nbsp; PATOUThat 's very romantic . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCERomantic ? It 's stupid . Gave up her career  --  for what ? Some slob from the market , who dragged those heavy sides of beef around till he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late for momma to make a comeback  --  she wound up as a cashier in the fish market . ( coming out of the kitchen ) The only smart thing she ever did was not to marry my father . &nbsp; PATOUYou mean you 're not  --  legitimate ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEThat 's right . You 'd think with a background like that I would have turned out no good . &nbsp; PATOUOh , I know you 're doing very well  --  but a girl like you  --  there are other kinds of jobs . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( lighting a cigarette ) This is n't just a job  --  it 's a profession . &nbsp; PATOUOf course . Somebody has to do these things . But in your case  --  I mean , now that I know you better  --  &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEOh , I get that all the time . Ran across a man the other night  --  he thought I was too good for this kind of work . And you know what he does for a living ? He 's a mortician ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEWhy is it that nine out of ten try to reform me ? You 're not one of those , are you ? &nbsp; PATOUWho , me ? Oh , no . I used to be one of those  --  petit bourgeois  --  but that was yesterday . I know better now . Irma steps into the bathroom , starts running a bath . The moment Nestor is left alone with Coquette , she starts growling at him . Irma returns from the bathroom . &nbsp; PATOU ( indicating Coquette ) I do n't think she cares for me . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEYou two better make friends  --  if you 're going to live here . &nbsp; PATOUWe better . ( a take ) Live here ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEWhy ? Do n't you like the idea ? &nbsp; PATOUSure I like the idea  --  it 's just that I had no idea  --  &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( picking up his suitcase and opening it ) Is that all you have ?  --  43  --  &nbsp; PATOUYes . Just my old uniform  --  and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those suits in the closet . ( Nestor hesitates ) Go ahead . Nestor crosses to the closet , examines the loud suits hanging there . Irma goes into the bathroom . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCELet 's see how you look in the brown one with the pinstripes  --  he hardly ever wore it  --  said it was too conservative . Nestor takes the coat off the hangar , puts it on . There 's room in there for two of him . &nbsp; PATOUI think the sleeves may be a little long . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( from bathroom ) Do n't worry about that . There 's a brown derby that goes with it . Nestor pulls his sleeve up , reaches for a derby hanging on a hook , puts it on . Dangling from the same hook is a pair of field glasses . &nbsp; PATOUWhat are these glasses for ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( from the bathroom ) For the races . &nbsp; PATOU ( taking the glasses off the hook ) They 're pretty powerful . He puts the field glasses to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathroom .

He reverses them . What he now sees is an enormous head closeup of Irma . &nbsp; PATOUI 'll bet nobody 's ever seen you like this before . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEYou 'd lose . &nbsp; PATOUThrough field glasses ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCENo bet .  --  44  --  &nbsp; PATOUYou know , when I first met you , I thought you were pretty . I was totally wrong . You 're beautiful . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEYou 're out of your mind . Or out of focus . &nbsp; PATOUWithout makeup , you look about fourteen years old . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEI wore makeup when I was fourteen  --  so I could pass for seventeen . And by the time I was seventeen  --  &nbsp; PATOU ( lowering glasses ) Never mind . I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a mirror ) This coat is ridiculous . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( from bathtub ) We 'll have it fixed . Just take it in to Maurice the tailor  --  &nbsp; PATOUAll right . But I wo n't wear the hat . ( tosses derby away ) &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( from bathtub ) You have to . It all goes together  --  the suit and the hat and the glasses  --  for when you go to the race track . &nbsp; PATOURace track ? ( starting into bathroom ) Who 's got time for the race track ? I 've got to find myself a job . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( looking up ) What do you mean  --  a job ? &nbsp; PATOUOh , I 'm sure I can pick up something around the market . Unloading trucks  --  or sweeping the stalls  --  ( Irma lowers her head ) What 's the matter ? No answer from Irma . Nestor sits down on the edge of the tub , raises her face toward him . There are tears in her eyes . &nbsp; PATOUDid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to make me feel cheap . &nbsp; PATOUCheap ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEHow would it look if I let you go to work ? You want the other girls to think I ca n't support my man ? &nbsp; PATOUIrma  --  &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEI want you to be better dressed than anybody  --  45  --  else  --  I want you to have more money in your pocket  --  I want to be proud of you . &nbsp; PATOUIrma , you do n't understand . I never felt like this about anybody . . . . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( tenderly ) That 's why I 'm going to work twice as hard for you as I ever did for any of the others . She puts her wet arms around him , pulls him toward her , kisses him lingeringly.  --  46  --  Section Details BISTRO  --  NIGHT Business as usual .

He is wearing Hippolyte 's cut-down striped suit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The colorless caterpillar has turned into a flashy butterfly , but he seems distraught and absentminded as he leans on his cue . Casablanca Charlie , who has been shooting , misses . &nbsp; CASABLANCA CHARLIE ( to Nestor ) Your turn . ( Nestor pays no attention ; Charlie snaps his fingers ) Hey , Tiger . Nestor half-heartedly makes a shot , then drops his cue on the table . &nbsp; PATOUI do n't feel like playing . Get somebody else . He walks over to the bar . &nbsp; PATOU ( to Moustache ) Give me a drink . &nbsp; MOUSTACHECoqnac ? Pernod ? Calvados ? &nbsp; PATOUYeah . And in that order . He looks out the window toward the street , as Moustache puts three glasses and starts to pour . &nbsp; PATOUWhy do n't you shut that damn jukebox off ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHEWhat 's the problem ? You 're sitting pretty  --  you got a gold mine working for you  --  &nbsp; PATOUAnd shut yourself off , too . He tosses down the cognac , starts on the Pernod . A young sailor comes bouncing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure seems eager . &nbsp; SAILOR ( to Moustache ) Say , I 'm looking for Irma  --  you know , the one with the green stockings and the bow-wow ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHE ( a look at Nestor ) She 's not here . Go away . &nbsp; SAILORI 've been away  --  Tangiers , Naples , Cairo  --  met up with a lot of dames , but there 's nothing like that Irma.  --  47  --  &nbsp; PATOU ( grabbing him ) Get out of here . &nbsp; SAILORWhat is this ? &nbsp; PATOUI know about you . You 're the one with Brigitte Bardot tattooed on your chest . He rips open the sailor 's blouse . There is a tattoo there , all right  --  but it 's not Bardot , it 's Napoleon . &nbsp; SAILORHey , you crazy ? Nestor shoves him away in disgust . The sailor staggers backward , lands in the lap of Amazon Annie , who is sitting at a table . &nbsp; PATOU ( turning back to Moustache ) She must know two sailors . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEThat 's a hell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downing third drink ) I just ca n't take it .

It 's a God-given talent  --  it was meant to be shared with the public . &nbsp; PATOU ( indicating empty glasses ) Again . RUE CASANOVA Irma , the poodle under her arm and a cigarette in her mouth , is crossing from the hotel toward the bistro . Coming in the opposite direction is Amazon Annie , leading the young sailor . &nbsp; SAILOR ( spotting Irma ) Hey , there 's the bow-wow ! &nbsp; AMAZON ANNIE ( dragging him into the hotel ) Come on , sailor . Keep rowing . BISTRO Irma enters , looks around for Nestor , comes up beside him . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEWhew , what a night !

She sets the dog down on the counter , takes a small jeweller 's box from her bag . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEHere 's a little present for you . &nbsp; PATOUWhat is it ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEA stickpin. ( opens box ) You put it in your tie . &nbsp; PATOUI do n't need it . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEYes you do .

Besides , if I stay away that long , I 'll lose my spot . &nbsp; MOUSTACHE ( coming up with cigarettes ) She 's got the best location on the street . &nbsp; PATOU ( to Irma ) We never have any time together . You 're out there all night , you sleep all day  --  &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( lights a cigarette from the old one ) If only Monsieur Camembert were still around . ( to Moustache ) You remember Monsieur Camembert , do n't you ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHEDo I ? Big spender . &nbsp; PATOUWho 's Monsieur Camembert ?  --  49  --  &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEThat 's what we called him  --  he was a cheese wholesaler at the market  --  used to see me twice a week  --  always gave me five hundred francs  --  so I did n't have to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went to cooking school , and I knitted sweaters , and I played solitaire  --  he was such a nice man . &nbsp; PATOUWhat happened to him ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEHis wife died  --  so he stopped coming around . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEIt was a great loss to all of us . Kiki the Cossack bursts in through the door . &nbsp; KIKI THE COSSACKHey girls  --  here comes another bus-load of tourists . The poules who have been hanging around the bistro rush out . Irma extinguishes her cigarette . &nbsp; PATOUIrma  --  stay here . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEYou 're sweet . Kiss me. ( he does ) You know , I 've been thinking . Maybe you 're right . I 'm going to give it up . &nbsp; PATOUYou are ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEI promise you  --  ( putting cigarettes in bag )  --  this is absolutely the last pack I 'll ever smoke . Coquette barks sharply . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( to poodle ) All right , all right  --  we 're going . ( to Nestor ) See you later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the other girls .

Pity I do n't have rubber pockets so I can smuggle some back to London . Haw ! Nestor has been watching and listening intently . He looks after the two Englishmen as they start out . &nbsp; PATOU ( pensively ) An Englishman  --  maybe that would n't be such a bad idea . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEIt 's worth a try .

It 's very simple , really . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEWhat are you talking about ? &nbsp; PATOUDo n't you see ? Irma 's going to have a rich lover  --  and it 's going to be me . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEYou 're mad . &nbsp; PATOUYes , I 'm mad . And desperate . But it 's the only way out .

Nestor is seated on a crate behind an upturned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a false beard and mustache , and his hair is parted in the middle . He wears a morning coat and an ascot , and overall looks like a roving ambassador from Schweppes . His striped coat and straw hat are hanging from a nail on the wall .

He steps behind the counter , glances out the window to make sure the coast is clear , then casually presses a button . pp. 20-34 &nbsp; pp. 54-69 RUE CASANOVA The iron doors of the sidewalk elevator alongside the bistro start to open . Like Venus rising out of the ocean , Nestor , as Lord X , emerges showly from the cellar . He stiffens his back , shoulders his umbrella , and flashing a V-for-Victory sign to Moustache inside the bistro , strides briskly around the corner  --  to the accompaniment of RULE BRITANNIA . He makes a slight detour , then crosses to the other side of the street where the Hotel Casanova is . &nbsp; KIKI THE COSSACK ( throwing him a kiss ) Hello , Uncle .

Now that I 'm president , I 'm going to get this organization moving ahead .  --  He leads her to the bar , and they seat themselves . Nestor 's cheek with the lipstick is away from Irma . &nbsp; PATOUHow did it go with his Lordship ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEFine . You know , I 'm beginning to like him a lot . &nbsp; PATOUIt 's a good thing that bridge fell on him  --  or I might be jealous . ( to Moustache ) Cognac . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEPernod for me. ( indicating Coquette ) Nothing for her . ( turning back to Nestor ) He 's getting a divorce . Maybe he 'll come to see me more often now . &nbsp; PATOUMore often ? I doubt it . I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOUCEOh , he 's got this big estate . . . . &nbsp; PATOUYou know what taxes are in England on a big estate ? Some of these lords have to scrounge around for a living . During the following Moustache , pouring the drinks , notices the lipstick on Nestor 's cheek . He tries to draw his  --  77  --  attention to it , in pantomime , but Nestor does n't catch on . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEIf he saw me three times a week  --  that 's fifteen hundred francs  --  just think  --  I could buy you a car  --  one of those sports models . Kiki thinks she 's such a hot shot because she got her guy a motor scooter  --  but wait till they see you driving up and down the street with the top down . And I 'm going to get you one of those little caps to go with it  --  Moustache , wiping the counter by now , casually takes a swipe at Nestor 's cheek with the bar-rag , trying to get the lipstick off . &nbsp; PATOU ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LA DOUCE ( peering around at his other cheek ) He 's trying to get the lipstick off . &nbsp; PATOULipstick ? Where did that come from ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEGood question . &nbsp; PATOUIt must 've been you . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEThat 's it ! &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEMe ? I was up in the hotel with his Lordship . &nbsp; MOUSTACHE ( to Nestor ) That 's not it ! The jukebox starts blaring DIS-DONC . &nbsp; PATOUOh , yes . It was at the board meeting  --  we were taking a vote  --  and one of the girls was doing a little lobbying  --  &nbsp; MOUSTACHEThat must be it ! &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEJust which girl was doing a little lobbying ? As if in answer to her question , Lolita comes twisting up . &nbsp; LOLITACome on , Tiger  --  how about it ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( to Lolita , sweetly ) You dropped something . &nbsp; LOLITAWhere ? She turns around and bends over . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEThere ! She boots Lolita in the behind , sending her sprawling on the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on the bar stool , with her arms folded . &nbsp; PATOUPlease , girls  --   --  78  --  Lolita pushes Nestor away , very deliberately kicks the bar stool out from under Irma , and she take a pratfall . As she gets to her feet , Nestor steps between them . &nbsp; PATOULook , I 'm the president here  --  Irma pushes him aside , faces Lolita . They stare at each other for a moment , then Irma reaches out , removes Lolita 's heart-shaped glasses , snaps them in two , and tosses the pieces away . &nbsp; PATOUNow that 's enough . Shake hands and make up . The girls eye each other for a moment . Then Lolita takes a couple of windups with her oversized handbag , brings it crashing down on Irma 's head . A beat . Irma slaps Lolita 's face . Another beat . Lolita grabs Irma 's hair , pulls her out of scene , and the fight is on for real . Nestor motions to Moustache , who quickly hands him a siphon of seltzer . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the sound o.s. , we gather that it is quite a brawl . Nestor lets go with a spritz in one direction , then in another . &nbsp; PATOU ( suddenly ) Oh no . You would n't  --  From what happens on his face now we deduce that Irma has tossed Lolita through the air . Nestor averts his head painfully  --  he ca n't bear to watch . With his eyes closed , he sends a spritz in the direction of the victim . FADE OUT :  --  79  --  LES HALLES  --  NIGHT , DAWN , AND EARLY MORNING Another montage of Nestor working himself to a frazzle  --  hacking a steer in half with a cleaver , disgustedly lugging a pig 's head , emptying a basket of live lobsters and getting his finger caught by one of them , building a pyramid of lettuce which collapses . Ultimately , dressed as a mec again , he collects his pay and heads for home .

You must 've lost ten pounds . &nbsp; PATOUFifteen . I just weighed myself on the meat scale . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEWhat do you expect ? Night after night  --  loading , unloading  --  in the window , out the window  --  on with the beard , off with the beard  --  you 're going to fall apart , kid . &nbsp; PATOUI do n't care  --  as long as I can keep her off the street . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEIt 's a hard way to earn an easy living . Nestor has taken a croissant out of the bag and , munching on it , staggers off in the direction of Irma 's apartment house .

IRMA 'S APARTMENT  --  MORNING Nestor , a wreck of a mec , comes climbing up the rainpipe , and with the last ounce of his strength manages to get over the railing of the balcony . He carefully opens the squeaking door , starts inside . IRMA 'S APARTMENT Nestor slips inside , takes off his shoes . As he moves into the room , we see Irma leaning against the mantel , wearing a robe and puffing on a cigarette . But Nestor does not see her . As he shucks off his coat and shirt , he suddenly realizes that the bed is empty . He slowly swivels his head around toward Irma , who is watching him icily . &nbsp; PATOUYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Irma keeps puffing away on the cigarette ) You promised me you would n't smoke any more .

Sometimes I was with Amazon Annie  --  and sometimes with Mimi the Mau-Mau  --  and sometimes with the twins . They all want me to handle them .

Irma crosses to the closet , pulls out Nestor 's old policeman 's uniform and his cardboard suitcase and tosses them at him . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEThis is what you came with . Now get out . &nbsp; PATOUYou 're not going to throw me out , baby . ( grabs her wrist , twists her arm behind her back , like Hippolyte ) Because you 're crazy about me , are n't you ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCELet go . &nbsp; PATOUYou 're going to buy me a new car , remember ? And a sports cap  --  &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCELET GO ! &nbsp; PATOUAnd when you buy be the cap  --  I want it with a little strap in the back  --  understand ! Irma breaks free , turns on him , spits in his face . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEThat 's what you 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and see how well you 'll do . You think you 're Numero Uno  --  I 'm Numero Uno . Go out in the street and ask the first man you see  --  ask anybody ! Nestor ca n't take that . He slaps her face . Irma , in tears , turns and rushes into the bathroom , slams the door and locks it from the inside . &nbsp; PATOUIrma . . . ( softly ) I 'm sorry . He is completely spent .

That 's his umbrella  --  and his eyepatch  --  and his solitaire cards  --  &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVREThank you , madame . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEWhere 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seine . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEOh , no ! &nbsp; PATOUIt 's a lot of nonsense . There is no Lord X. &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVREOf course there is n't . Because you killed him . Irma bursts into tears . Kiki comes over and puts a comforting arm around her shoulder . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEI saw the whole thing . He beat him up  --  stole his wallet  --  threw his body in the river  --  &nbsp; PATOUIrma  --  He takes a step toward her , but Inspector Lefevre stops him , starts going through his pockets .  --  94  --  &nbsp; PATOUNow wait a minute  --  ( an appeal ) Moustache , tell them . Inspector Lefevre finds Lord X 's billfold , shows it to Irma . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( nodding ) Yes , that 's the Lord's. ( tearfully ) He was such a sweet man  --  &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVREThe old , familiar pattern . Young policeman turns dishonest , becomes a mec , finally winds up as a murderer . It 's an open and shut case . &nbsp; PATOUWell , you 'll have to reopen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( loudly ) Sssh ! ( to Lefevre ) My client has nothing more to say at this time . &nbsp; PATOUYour client ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHEI have a law degree from the University of Grenoble  --  used to be one of the leading criminal attorneys in France before I was disbarred  --  but that 's another story . &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVRE ( to policeman ) Put the handcuffs on him . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEJust a moment . The accused has a right to confer with his lawyer .  --  95  --  He draws Nestor aside , out of earshot of the others . &nbsp; PATOUWhat are you trying to do ? Why do n't we just tell them the truth ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHEThe truth ? That 's dynamite . &nbsp; PATOUBut I 'm innocent . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEThe jails are full of innocent people  --  because they told the truth . What 's your defense ? You could n't have killed Lord X because you were Lord X  --  only you were n't really Lord X , you were a mec  --  only you were n't really a mec , you were working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hundred francs to pay for making love to your own girl , whom you could have made love to any night for free , except that you were too tired from making the money to give to Lord X to give to Irma to give to you . That 's the truth  --  and if you tell that mishmash to a jury , you 're a cinch to get fifteen years . &nbsp; PATOUWhat am I going to do ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHENothing . Just put yourself in my hands . ( turns to the police ) Gentlemen , my client admits his crime . &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVREHe does ? &nbsp; PATOUI do ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHEBut let us consider the motive . Why would a mec kill his girl 's best customer ? ( points to billfold ) For five hundred francs  --  when he could get that twice a week every week ? It would be killing the goose that lays the golden egg . ( indicates Irma 's suitcase ) Or maybe because they were running away together  --  because he was losing his meal-ticket ? That 's equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have had any girl working for him . &nbsp; KIKI THE COSSACKThat 's right . Irma has now stopped crying , and is listening attentively . &nbsp; MOUSTACHESo we are left with only one possible motive  --  jealousy . He was so much in love with Irma he could n't bear to have any other man touch her . Yes ,  --  96  --  Inspector , it 's the old familiar pattern  --  crime of passion ! Irma is now looking at Nestor in a new light . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCENestor  --  is that true ? &nbsp; PATOU ( drawing himself up to his full height ) Yes . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEYou did it because you loved me ? &nbsp; PATOUNow you know . Irma throws her arms around him , kisses him passionately . &nbsp; PATOU ( full of bravado ) And I 'd kill any other man who came near you . &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVRE ( drily ) Gets you right here , does n't it ? ( taps his chest ; then , bawling to policeman ) Take him away . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I 'll wait for you no matter how long it takes . The policemen separate the lovers , drag Nestor out toward the car . &nbsp; MOUSTACHE ( reassuringly ) You wo n't have to wait very long . This is France  --  a civilized country  --  l'amour toujours l'amour . When the jury hears my summation  --  two people in the gutter reaching for the stars  --  they 'll cry  --  they 'll cheer  --  they 'll carry him out of the courtroom on their shoulders ! DISSOLVE TO : pp. 70-81 &nbsp; pp. 97-112 PRISON COURTYARD  --  DAY From a watchtower on the wall , an armed guard is keeping an eye on a dozen prisoners exercising in the cobbled courtyard below . They are jogging around in a circle , each resting his right hand on the shoulder of the man in front of him . They wear shapeless suits , collarless shirts , berets , and wooden shoes . The scene is reminiscent of the famous painting by Van Gogh . Or maybe it was Schwartz . One of the prisoners circling around endlessly is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . &nbsp; PRISON GUARDHey , Patou . Patou ! Nestor breaks out of the circle , still jogging .  --  97  --  &nbsp; PRISON GUARDThere 's a visitor here to see you . Nestor follows the guard through the gate . VISITORS ' ROOM A wire screen divides the room . There are benches on either side , partitioned by other screens into individual cubicles . Several prisoners are seated , talking to visiting relatives . Pacing up and down on the visitor 's side is Moustache . A door opens , and the guard leads Nestor in , then takes up a position against the wall . Nestor spots Moustache , approaches the screen with a look of disgust on his face . &nbsp; PATOUOh , it 's you . You 're lucky I ca n't get my hands on you  --  &nbsp; MOUSTACHE ( hurt ) That 's no way to talk to your lawyer . They seat themselves , facing each other . &nbsp; PATOUSome lawyer . You were going to get me off scot free  --  crime of passion  --  they were going to carry me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't win ' em all . &nbsp; PATOUFifteen years of hard labor  --  for what ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHEIt 's too bad you did n't get sentenced to death  --  because then I could have had it commuted to life  --  and with good behavior , I could have gotten you paroled by Christmas . But a fifteen year sentence  --  that 's neither her nor there . &nbsp; PATOUNever mind that . Tell me about Irma  --  how is she ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHEShe 's fine . Here  --  I brought you a little souvenir . He pulls a green stocking out of his pocket , starts to push it through an opening in the wire mesh . Nestor pulls it the rest of the way . &nbsp; PATOUThanks . Why does n't she come to see me any more ? Why have n't I heard from her ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHEWell , she does n't want you to find out . &nbsp; PATOUFind out what ? ( anxiously ) She has n't gone  --  98  --  back on the street again , has she ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHEOh no , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still working in the fish market  --  as a cashier . &nbsp; PATOUThen what 's wrong ? I want to know . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEShe 's expecting . &nbsp; PATOUWho ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHEWho do you think ? ( holds hand in front of his stomach ) She 's out to here . She 's going to have a baby . &nbsp; PATOUA baby ? Are you sure ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHEWell , I 'd be greatly disappointed if it were anything else . &nbsp; PATOUWhen ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHEAny day now . &nbsp; PATOUListen , Moustache , I 've got to get out of here . I want to be with her  --  she needs me . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEHere  --  I brought you another souvenir. ( pulls a second green stocking out of his pocket , shoves it through the screen ) &nbsp; PATOUMore stockings ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHEAnd here 's another pair . And another  --  He is now pulling green stockings out of his hat and his sleeves , and pushing them through . &nbsp; PATOUHave you gone mad ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHEAnd one more  --  &nbsp; PATOUWhat am I going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want them , why do n't you throw them out the window ? But first , I would suggest that you tie them all together  --  &nbsp; PATOUWhat ? Moustache cocks his head at him slyly . DISSOLVE TO : PRISON WALL From a barred window high up in the wall , Nestor  --  99  --  plays out a green stocking . It is followed by a second stocking and a third stocking , all knotted together . As the rope of stockings snakes down the wall , CAMERA PANS DOWN to street level . Parked at the curb is an ancient car , with its motor running , and standing beside it , looking up tensely , is Moustache . From around the corner , a prison guard appears , carrying a sub-machine gun . Moustache glances around nervously as the guard hurries toward him . &nbsp; SECOND GUARDYou ca n't park here . Behind the guard 's back , the bottom stocking descends along the prison wall . &nbsp; MOUSTACHE ( quickly ) There 's something wrong with my motor . He lifts the hood of the car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment , then drifts over beside him , also sticks his head under the hood . Together they listen to the motor , which is idling roughly . Moustache backs up a step , throws a swift glance upward . Nestor has pried apart a couple of the iron bars , and climbing over the window sill , starts to lower himself down the knotted stockings . Moustache shuts his eyes painfully , ducks under the hood again . Nestor reaches the end of the stocking rope , drops to the ground . Seeing Moustache and the guard absorbed under the hood of the car , he joins them , peers over their shoulders . At that moment , the guard 's face lights up , and he hands his sub-machine gun to Nestor . Reaching for the idle screw , he adjusts it  --  and the motor  --  100  --  starts purring . The guard grins triumphantly at Moustache , and the three of them withdraw their heads from under the hood . Moustache slams it shut , Nestor hands the sub-machine gun back to the guard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nestor behind the wheel . The guard waves them on , and the car takes off , careens around the corner . As the guard resumes his rounds , he passes the green stockings dangling from the wall . Suddenly he freezes , turns around wide-eyed , follows the stockings up to the cell window . Then he starts blowing his whistle shrilly . DISSOLVE TO : Section Details IRMA 'S APARTMENT  --  DAY Irma , wearing a maternity outfit , is sitting in a chair knitting a baby garment  --  in green wool , naturally . Moustache was n't exaggerating when he said she 's " out to here . " Lying at her feet is Coquette . Suddenly the dog sits up , growling at a noise off-scene . Irma rises , crosses to the door , opens it  --  there is nobody in the corridor . As she turns back into the room , she sees Nestor standing in the open doorway of the balcony . He is still in his prison clothes . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( a scream ) Nestor ! &nbsp; PATOUSssh ! Irma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet him . They embrace lingeringly . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEWhat are you doing here ? How did you get away ? Nestor takes a small jeweller 's box out of his pocket , opens it to reveal a wedding ring . &nbsp; PATOUGive me your hand . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEDid they let you out ? &nbsp; PATOU ( taking her left hand ) Here  --  try this on . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEYou escaped , did n't you ? &nbsp; PATOUUh-huh. ( slipping ring on her third finger ) Hold still . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEOh , darling , why did you do it ? They 'll give you another five years . &nbsp; PATOU ( indicating ring ) I 'm afraid it 's too big .  --  101  --  &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEWhats this ? &nbsp; PATOUWe 're going to get married . ( removes ring ) &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEMarried ? &nbsp; PATOUWe want our baby to be legitimate , do n't we ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEYes , of course  --  &nbsp; PATOU ( glances tenderly at her bulging midriff ) How is the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked Coquette right off my lap . &nbsp; PATOU ( the proud father ) Takes after me . You know that when I was six months old I could change my own diapers ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCENestor  --  &nbsp; PATOUWhat is it ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEI ca n't marry you . &nbsp; PATOUWhat do you mean , you ca n't marry me . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEBecause I love you . &nbsp; PATOUYou love me so you ca n't marry me ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEThat 's right . Because it 's not our baby . You 're not the father . &nbsp; PATOUI 'm not ? ( grimly ) Who 's the father ? I 'll kill him . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEYou already did . It was Lord X. &nbsp; PATOULord X ? What makes you think  --  ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEA woman always knows these things . &nbsp; PATOUI do n't care . I 'll marry you anyway . I 'll bring it up just as if it were my own child . He kisses her . From a distance , comes the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sirens grow louder , Nestor hurries out onto the balcony , looks down . EXTERIOR IRMA 'S APARTMENT HOUSE Two police cars pull up with screeching brakes , and out scramble Inspector Lefevre and seven uniformed policemen . A couple of them stay behind to guard the entrance while the others led by Lefevre , dash inside . IRMA 'S APARTMENT Nestor ducks back in from the balcony .  --  102  --  &nbsp; PATOUThey 've got the place surrounded . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEMaybe you could go through the kitchen window  --  and over the roof . &nbsp; PATOU ( looking around the room thoughtfully ) No  --  I think I prefer the closet . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEThe closet ? That 's the first place they 'll look ! STAIRCASE OF APARTMENT HOUSE Inspector Lefevre and the policeman came pounding up the last flight of steps . Lefevre bangs on the door of Irma 's apartment . &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVREOpen up ! Police ! ( no answer ; he bangs again ) Come on , we know he 's in there . Still no reply . Lefevre nods to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , which gives slightly . Stepping back as far as they can on the landing , the two bruisers propel themselves toward the door again  --  and at the same moment , Irma opens it from inside . The two policemen go catapulting through the doorway and across the room . IRMA 'S APARTMENT Lefevre and the other policemen stalk through the door . The two bruisers are picking themselves off the floor . &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVRE ( looking around ) All right . Where 's Nestor ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEDo n't you know ? He 's in jail . You can visit him there every other Sunday . &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVRECute , huh ? ( to policemen ) Let 's search the place . The policemen spread out , looking in the kitchen , the bathroom and out on the balcony . Irma returns to her chair , resumes knitting . One of the policemen , DUPONT , pokes his head through one end of the curtain covering the clothes closet . At the same time , another policeman comes backing out through the other end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closet ) He 's not in there The other policeman also withdraws his head from the closet , and although he tries to keep his face averted , we  --  103  --  see that it is Nestor , back in his old police uniform . &nbsp; PATOU ( muttering ) Not in there . He busies himself with the search , constantly criss-crossing the paths of the other policemen , and trying not to reveal himself to Lefevre . Irma , knitting away , watches him nervously . Nestor squats and peers under the bed . He finds himself face to face with Dupont , who is peering under the other side of the bed . &nbsp; DUPONTNot under here . &nbsp; PATOU ( relieved ) Not under here . Meanwhile Lefevre has spotted a framed photograph of Nestor on the mantel . &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVRECome here , everybody . The policemen , including Nestor , gather around him and he holds up the photograph for them to see . &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVREThis is the man we 're looking for . The policemen all nod , as does Nestor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face , crosses back to the bed , looks under it again . Nestor quickly sticks his head into a cupboard . One by one the policemen are now abandoning the search , coming up to Lefevre and shrugging their shoulders . &nbsp; POLICEMANNo sign of him . &nbsp; PATOU ( echoing ) No sign of him . Dupont has returned to the mantel , and is studying Nestor 's photograph closely . &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVRE ( to Irma ) You tell Nestor he 'd better give himself up  --  or I 'll see to it that he spends the rest of his life behind bars . ( to the others ) Let 's go , men . As the policemen , Nestor among them , troop toward the door , Dupont goes back to the bed again and peers under it . &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVREWhat 's the matter ? &nbsp; DUPONTNothing . &nbsp; PATOULet 's go , men .  --  104  --  Lefevre marches through the door , the other policemen filing after him . Nestor is the last man out . A beat , then he backs into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Irma jumps out of her chair . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEOh , darling , did you hear that ? What are you you going to do ? &nbsp; PATOU ( crossing to her ) Well , the first thing I have to do is exchange the ring . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEWe ca n't get married now . You must run , you must hide . &nbsp; PATOU ( starts removing police uniform ) Nonsense . We 're going to have a big church wedding  --  with bridesmaids , and ushers and flowers  --  Moustache is making all the arrangements . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEBut they 'll catch you  --  they 'll lock you away . I 'm so afraid I 'll never see you again . &nbsp; PATOU ( taking her in his arms ) Do n't be afraid . Maybe a miracle will happen . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEI do n't believe in miracles . &nbsp; PATOUDo n't you ? When I first met you , you were a streetwalker  --  now you 're going to be a wife and a mother . Is n't that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bar , but there is no sign of the poules . At the end of the bar , somewhat apart from the others , stands Hippolyte . Moustache is just pouring him a drink . Over the scene comes the sound of receding police sirens . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEThey 're just wasting their time , looking for him in Irma 's apartment . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEDo n't worry . They 'll catch him . &nbsp; MOUSTACHENo they wo n't . Too much brains . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEYou mean Nestor is smarter than the whole police force ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHENo . But I am . They 're up against the mastermind. ( taps his forehead )  --  105  --  &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEI see . I 'll bet by now you 've got him on a boat to South America . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEGuess again . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTETo Hong Kong ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHEUh-uh . He 's right here in town . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEYou do n't say . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEIt 's ordinary common sense . ( confidentially ) You 've heard about a criminal always returning to the scene of his crime ? &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEYes  --  &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of looking there . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEYou mean he 's hiding under the same bridge where he  --  ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHEYeah , the Pont Royale. ( a gleam comes into Hippolyte 's eye ) Now look , Hippolyte , if you open your mouth about this to anyone  --  &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEMe ? Squeal on a colleague ? There 's such a thing as the code of the underworld , you know . He downs his drink . Moustache moves away from him , and picking up a glass full of carnations from behind the bar , starts to distribute them to the other mecs . The mecs put the flowers in the buttonholes of their lapels . As Moustache inserts a carnation in his own buttonhole , from o.s. comes the sound of a coin being inserted in the phone , and the dial spinning . Moustache looks off with a knowing smile . Hippolyte is at the phone . &nbsp; HIPPOLYTE ( keeping his voice low ) Desk sergeant ? Connect me with Inspector Lefevre  --  Just tell him I want to squeal on a colleague . DISSOLVE TO : QUAI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sirens screaming , come tearing down the Rue de Baune , turn into quai , and pull to a screeching stop at the Pont Royale . Out of the cars spill Police Inspector Lefevre , Hippolyte , and four policemen . Led by the Inspector , they scramble down the stairs toward the river bank .  --  106  --  RIVER BANK Once down the stairs , the police fan out looking for Nestor . The only soul in sight is a wizened man , sitting on the bank , fishing peacefully in the Seine . They check to make sure it is n't Nestor , then stand around helpless and disappointed  --  apparently they are on a wild goose chase . Suddenly one of the policemen spots something in the river , grabs the Inspector 's arm , points . Breaking through the surface of the water is what looks like a submarine periscope  --  but is actually an umbrella handle . It turns , scanning the horizon , then continues to emerge , followed by a homburg , and ultimately by Lord X  --  who is holding the up-raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Inspector , Hippolyte and the policeman gawk in complete disbelief at this apparition . Wading out of the water , and coming up the steps , is Lord X , dripping wet . He does it with the greatest nonchalance , as if it were the most natural thing in the world . &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVRE ( his eyes bulging ) You  --  &nbsp; PATOUI beg your pardon . He tilts his head , tries to dislodge the water from his ear with the palm of his hand . &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVREYou 're supposed to be dead . Murdered . &nbsp; PATOUAre you quite sure ? &nbsp; HIPPOLYTEI saw it with my own eyes . &nbsp; PATOUSorry to disappoint you , old boy . But other than a slight headache , I feel absolutely chapper  --  I mean , chipper . &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVREWe 've been dragging the river for the last nine months . Where 've you been ? &nbsp; PATOUFair question . Let me see  --  ( a beat ) I have n't the foggiest . All I remember is  --  the climate was rather wet . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small fish out of his coat pocket .  --  107  --  &nbsp; PATOUI trust this clears things up satisfactorily ? ( tipping his hat ) Cheerio  --  pip-pip  --  and carry on . He starts toward the stairs . As he passes Hippolyte , who is staring at him open-mouthed , he plops the fish into his mouth . Twirling his umbrella , he marches up the steps to the quai , while the Inspector , Hippolyte and the policemen look after him transfixed . DISSOLVE TO : Section Details CHURCH  --  DAY The bells are ringing . A wedding marquee has been set up over the entrance , and a group of curious onlookers are gathered around it . From inside comes organ music . CHAPEL The pews are filled almost to capacity with denizens of Les Halles and the Rue Casanova  --  butchers , fishmongers , and a scattering of civilians . Coming up the aisle is the wedding procession  --  the poules , dressed as bridesmaids , accompanied by the mecs , wearing carnations in their lapels . As they reach the altar rail , the bridesmaids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either side of the aisle . The last of the bridesmaids is carrying Coquette in a basket decorated with flowers . Irma approaches up the aisle , on the arm of Moustache . She is in a maternity wedding gown and white veil , and her face is positively radiant . But suddenly she winces with pain .  --  108  --  &nbsp; MOUSTACHE ( whispering ) Are you all right ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( under her breath ) The pains are coming every two minutes . &nbsp; MOUSTACHEJust try to hold on a little longer . They reach the head of the aisle and stop . Standing in front of the altar are a PRIEST and two altar boys . The organ music comes to an end . &nbsp; PRIEST ( glancing around ) Where 's the groom ? Moustache shrugs , raises his hands . Then he glances back toward the rear of the chapel where Jojo , the best man , is waiting . Jojo shrugs , raises his one hand . &nbsp; MOUSTACHE ( turning back to Irma ) Do n't worry . If worst comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears breathlessly at the rear of the chapel . He is back in his mec 's suit , and is just threading a carnation through his button-hole . Jojo falls in beside him , and they start up the aisle with measured tread .

He nods to the Priest . &nbsp; PRIESTNestor , wilt thou take Irma , here present , for thy lawful wife , according to the rite of our holy Mother , the Church ? &nbsp; PATOUI will . &nbsp; PRIESTIrma , wilt thou take Nestor , here present , for thy lawful husband , according to the rite of our holy Mother , the church ? &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCEI will . &nbsp; PRIESTJoin your right hands and repeat after me .

One of the mecs notices that his neighbor has a toothpick in his mouth , jabs him in the ribs . The offender gets rid of the toothpick . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( repeating after the Priest ) I , Irma , take thee , Nestor , for my lawful husband  --  to have and to hold , from this day forward  --  for better , for worse , for richer , for poorer , in sickness and in health  --  till death do us part .

Moustache signals to the Priest to speed it up . &nbsp; PRIEST ( reading faster ) OREMUS . BENEDI , DOMINUM ANNULUM HUNC , QUEM NOS IN TUO NOMINE BENEDICIMUS , UT QUA EUM GESTAVERIT FIDELITATEM INTEGRAM SUO SPONSO TENENS , IN PACE ET VOLUNTATE TUA PERMANEAT ATQUE IN MUTUA CARITATE SEMPER VIVAT .

He sprinkles the ring with holy water , hands it to Nestor , who slips it on Irma 's finger .  --  110  --  &nbsp; PATOU ( repeating after Priest ) With this ring I thee wed  --  and I pledge thee my fidelity . Irma , with a beatific smile on her face , swoons . Nestor and Moustache catch her , hurry her down the aisle , the rest of the wedding party following . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Moustache come past Inspector Lefevre , he claps a hand on Nestor 's shoulder . &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVREJust a minute , Patou . &nbsp; PATOUYes ? Moustache does n't stop but continues out of scene , with Irma draped around his shoulder . Irma glances back anxiously . &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVREI want to congratulate you . It was a touching ceremony . &nbsp; PATOUThank you . Nice of you fellows to show up . &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVREWe 're planning a little reception for you . At the police station . &nbsp; PATOUCa n't it wait ? My wife is about to  --  &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVRESome sort of hoax has been perpetrated , and I intend to get to the bottom of it . &nbsp; PATOUYou ca n't arrest me in church . &nbsp; INSPECTOR LEFEVREWho said anything about arresting you ? I want you to rejoin the police force  --  and help us solve this case . &nbsp; PATOURejoin the force ? I 'd like that .

As a matter of fact , I 'm about to have one myself . ( from off comes the cry of a newborn infant ) I 've just had it ! Excuse me . He rushes over to a door , marked BUREAU , in front of which the mecs are gathered . They step aside for Nestor , and he opens the door slowly . OFFICE Nestor peers in . Irma is obscured from view by the  --  111  --  bridesmaids , who are clustering around the couch on which she is lying . Moustache , with his coat off and his sleeves rolled up , is standing in the middle of the room , holding a baby wrapped in Irma 's veil . &nbsp; MOUSTACHE ( to Nestor ) It 's a girl . Smoothest delivery I ever had . &nbsp; PATOU ( touching the baby gingerly ) She 's beautiful . ( reacting ) You delivered the baby ? &nbsp; MOUSTACHEWhy not ? I used to be chief obstetrician in French Equatorial Africa , under Doctor Schweitzer . Nestor crosses to the bridesmaids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , covered with a blanket . &nbsp; IRMA LA DOUCE ( weak but happy ) Nestor  --  ( he sits on the edge of the couch , kisses her ) They 're not taking you away ? &nbsp; PATOUNever .
