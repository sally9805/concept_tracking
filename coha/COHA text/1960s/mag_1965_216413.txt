The case was serious enough to warrant a specialist , so into the Nairobi headquarters of the African Physicians ' Association strode Dr. Symon Thuita to handle it . As Dr. Thuita well knew , the best way to begin any examination is by taking the patient 's pulse . " If the pulse leaps like a frog , " he explained , " the problem is in the throat . If it jumps like a cow , it is in the gastric system , and if it is smooth as a snake , then it is in the belly . " <P> To protect himself against infection , Dr. Thuita slipped an antelope horn into his trousers , carefully allowing the prong to protrude from his fly . Then he tested the patient 's credibility by placing a live toad in his mouth . If the toad jumped down the patient 's throat , he was clearly a malingerer . If not , he was truly a victim of that all too common African malady , nightmare . The toad stayed put , so Dr. Thuita smeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dried snakeskin , and advised him to take a long swim . Prognosis : excellent . <P> <P> Tools of the Trade . Symon Thuita is an M'ganga , which is Swahili for witch doctor , and he is one of Kenya 's best . His adept handling of the Nairobi nightmare case marked another step forward for the fledgling A.P.A . Its ultimate aim is to mold the new republic 's 6,000 witch doctors , as well as 100 or more Indian ayurvedics , or herbalists , into a kind of copy of the American Medical Association which will carry black magic into the 20th century , just as Africa 's politicians have done for tribalism . <P> <P> Kenya 's witch doctors are an impressive lot . Clad in ostrich plumes , tarbooshes , beaded caps , seashell belts and fur aprons , they emit noises even stranger than their appearance as they stalk along with pebble-filled antelope horns , porcupine quills and fly whisks . Their satchels of leopard or monkey skin bulge with the tools of their trade : magical elixirs ( miti-shambd ) , dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They represent the only form of medical attention paid to nearly 80% of Kenya 's 8,000,000 Africans and Asians , despite a government program that has spent $9,000,000 in the past year to erect 160 modern medical centers and 266 dispensaries . Even some whites turn to the resident M'ganga now and then . <P> <P> On the Spot . The A.P.A . is headed by a pair of grizzled Nairobi medicine men , M'ganga Ngari Kinyugo and Ayurvedic Vaid Bhagwandas Patel , and has attracted 2,000 members from Lake Victoria to Mombasa , charges dues of 280 a month , holds monthly meetings , forms committees and clashes with the government , just like medical associations elsewhere . It also feuds with rival organizations , notably one called African Repairs , whose aim is simply the repair of Africans but whose choice of name is unfortunate . Said one almost-member : " It sounds too much like a society of garage mechanics . "
