" Christianity begins in the home , " says the Rev. Donald V. Roberts , 36 , and for him it is literally true . Last week Presbyterian Roberts conducted dedication services at the first American Protestant church ever organized in Moscow : one room of his new apartment , near Moscow University and the Red Chinese embassy . About 75 people crowded into " Christ Church " for the ceremony , and U.S. Ambassador Foy Kohler and Britain 's Sir Humphrey Trevelyan read Scripture lessons . <P> Formerly pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Tonawanda , N.Y. , Roberts in 1962 became the first Protestant chaplain ever assigned to Moscow 's U.S. colony . With his wife and daughter , he spent a year in Room 306 of the Sovietskaya Hotel , holding services on alternate Sundays at the British and American embassies . Finally the Soviet agency responsible for helping foreigners found him two adjoining apartments in a new building . Roberts had the wall separating his two living rooms torn down to create an area large enough for his church . <P> Following services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children of the congregation in the Roberts ' bedroom , study , dining area and one of the double apartment 's kitchens . " It 's a mishmash , " Roberts admits . " This is the place where we worship , where we have our friends , where I work , where the baby plays . " Small as it is , Roberts ' church outshines the facilities afforded Father Joseph Frederic Richard , latest of the Roman Catholic priests who have ministered to Americans off and on in Moscow for 30 years ; the chapel in Richard 's apartment holds only 40 people . <P> Roberts has friendly relations with some members of the Russian Orthodox <P> Church , although no Russians attended his dedication ceremony . He thinks that Christ Church , with its makeshift , homespun quality , is appropriate to the role of Christianity in the Soviet Union and is a better symbol of what the church means than a cathedral . " A church is n't a building , " he says . " It 's a fellowship of people who come together to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church in the home is one way of saying that every home has within it the potential of becoming a church . It has been said that religion is an opiate . I know differently . I know of faith in God as an awakening . "
