Her qualifications for the secretarial job on the Washington staff of Maryland 's Senator-elect Joseph Tydings , 36 , were pretty impressive . She was an ultraloyal Democrat who had worked seven days a week for Tydings during the election campaign , could type 90 words a minute , take dictation at the stopwatch speed of 100 words per , and seemed a cinch for the job . But a girl ca n't have everything . It came out that leggy , blonde Mary Ellen Terziu , 23 , also moonlighted her nights away as a bunny at the Baltimore Playboy Club . Up went the chances of the 200 other applicants for the job , and down went Mary Ellen 's . To make her Christmas unforgettable , her Playboss fired her for having " political affiliations . " Oh , Tydings of comfort and joy . <P> <P> " Making 70 is no time for congratulations , " boomed Australia 's Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies as he celebrated his threescore and ten last week . " It 's the end of the road , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 71 . " But the acid old statesman with the snow-white mane and beetling black brows did seem to be mellowing after 16 years as Down Under 's chief of state . He surprised newsmen with a rare birthday interview , chatted breezily for half an hour , even posed for cameramen before shooing them away with word that on doctor 's orders he will take the month of January off for a vacation " on the bosom of the deep-where there are no telephones , no interviews and no speeches . " <P> <P> " Hi , " beamed the pretty young thing , " I 'm Mowena Glunch . " Well , she was n't , of course . She was Inez Chapin Mutton , 18 , and she was one of 98 white-gowned young ladies being presented to society at the Debutante Cotillion and Christmas Ball at Manhattan 's WaldorfAstoria . The very In thing this year was to introduce yourself to the postdebs and Ivy Leaguers trudging down the reception line as another girl entirely , so everybody had the most awful time sorting out Elizabeth Funston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 18 , and Fernanda Kellogg , 18 . But then the ritual began as always with the Coming Out Waltz , followed by the Garland Dance , the Polka Sleigh Ride and the Christmas Star , in which the gals kneel in the dark , hold candles and sing carols . Meyer Davis ' band struck up Every thing 's Coming Up Roses , swung into rock ' n ' roll for the watusi , frug and monkey lovers . And before anybody realized it , it was 3 a.m. - and Good Night , Ladies . <P> <P> Had he chosen law , his famous father could have greased the ways a little . But Thomas E. Dewey Jr. , 32 , wanted to make it himself in finance . Make it he did . A vice president of Wall Street Investment Banker Kuhn Loeb &; Co. at 31 , he has now been elected one of the youngest general partners in the firm 's 97-year history . All this after his Princeton graduating class ( 1954 ) made him its second choice for " least likely to succeed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what else can you do on a Sunday in New York ? " asked Ethel Kennedy , 35 , as she whirled round Manhattan 's Rockefeller Center ice-skating rink with the Senator-elect and five ( Michael , 6 ; Courtney , 8 ; Kathleen , 13 ; David , 9 ; Joe , 12 ) of their eight children . What else , indeed ? <P>
