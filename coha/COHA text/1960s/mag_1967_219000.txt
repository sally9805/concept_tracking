" THERE 'S no business like global business " might be called the theme of this week 's cover story on the expansion of American industry abroad . Traditionally , in this year-end issue , TIME presents a comprehensive view of major trends and portents in the economy . This year the spotlight centers on the dramatic internationalization of U.S. enterprises-the reshaping of American companies into complex supranational entities . <P> <P> The cover story , written in New York by Spencer Davidson , drew heavily on reports filed from financial world capitals , where TIME 'S reporters keep constant tab on economic developments . A principal pivot was Correspondent Robert Ball , who is based in Zurich but whose beat is business anywhere in Europe . The two-page study of " The Nervous Year " in U.S. business that supplements the cover story was written by Gurney Breckenfeld . Reporters and correspondents across the country tapped their business sources for that story , with an important part of the reporting being done by the Washington Bureau 's Juan Cameron , whose beat is economics as it relates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in overall charge of the project . <P> <P> WE begin nearly every week of " " the year with the possibility that our biggest story-the cover-is liable to change any time up to a few hours before we are scheduled to go to press . The one issue when such a change is unlikely is that which appears in the first week of the year . That issue-next week's-is reserved for the Man of the Year . By traditional definition , he ( or she ) is the person who , in the judgment of the editors , dominated the news of the past year and left an indelible mark - for good or ill-on history . A year ago we chose not an individual but a whole generation that was making a special impact on life all around the world : " Youth : Twenty-Five and Under . " <P> <P> This year , as usual , readers are writing in to suggest or guess who the choice should or will be . One letter wryly suggested that our 1967 choice should add a chapter to last year 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and semi-facetious suggestions has included Girls Who Look Good in Mini skirts , The Beatles ' Guru , the Sands Hotel Vice President Who Slugged Frank Sinatra , and Sgt. Pepper . While most of the proposals have been of a more serious nature , it is remarkable that this year , while we have received a heavy flow of suggestions , no individual or idea is clearly favored among our readers . <P> For what the editors thought , we can only say : see TIME next week .
