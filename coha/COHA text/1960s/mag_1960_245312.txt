" When the average Frenchman feels worried about the situation , he buys Le Monde , " muses Le Monde 's Editorial Director Hubert Beuve-Mry . " We have learned to increase the print automatically during periods of worry and uncertainty , and our circulation jumps to 300,000 during times of crisis . It is events such as the accouchement of Brigitte Bardot or Queen Elizabeth which send our competitors ' sales soaring . For us it is a political crisis . " <P> Last week Le Monde 's sales indicated a period somewhere between uncertainty and crisis . Contained in Le Monde 's 16 somber pages were reports on worldly woes , from the U.N.-to the Congo . But it was an article near the bottom of Page One that commanded the French citizen 's closest attention . Signed by " Sirius , " the piece predicted that unless Charles de Gaulle soon ends the Algerian war , France will plunge back into chaos worse than that from which he rescued it in 1958 . <P> <P> Running the Gamut . That gloomy forecast deserved attention if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hubert Beuve-Mry-the editor of France 's most respected daily . Beuve-Mry , 58 , a grave , greying man with a permanently skeptical arch to his brow , has modeled Le Monde after his own image . Like its editor , Le Monde is more conservative than Catholic , more trenchant than traditional , more republican than radical , more pro-French than anti-American , more non-Communist than antiCommunist . At a time when much of the French press ranges from sycophantic toward De Gaulle to uncritical , Le Monde has been his most respectable-and most persistent-critic . No one knows better than Beuve-Mry how difficult it is for the foreigner to classify Le Monde . " We have , " he says , " run through the whole gamut of American adjectives - leftist , independent , authoritative , highly respected . " It has been all these . And in its day it has taken many unpopular stands , and some odd ones . <P> Le Monde 's circulation , ranging from 215,000 to a crisis-created 300,000 , ranks it only sixth among Paris ' dailies . As a dutiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of so many speeches and diplomatic exchanges that admirers compare it to the New York Times . Le Monde makes few concessions to the average reader . Says Beuve-Mry : " It has a stern aspect-no photographs , no cartoons , no short stories . " <P> In this very refusal to kowtow to popular taste lies one strength of Le Monde-and of Editor Beuve-Mry . The son of a Paris jeweler , Beuve-Mry earned a doctorate of law , went to Prague in 1928 , where he became a correspondent for a big Paris paper , Le Temps . The experience was shaking . Beuve-Mry discovered that the news columns of Le Temps , like those of many another prewar French daily , were for hire . After the appeasement of <P> Hitler at Munich , which Le Temps applauded , Beuve-Mry quit the paper in disgust , returned from Prague to Paris and later joined the Resistance .
