The Southern Presbyterian Church is a gently , insistently conservative group , both theologically and politically . Its 928,056 members , 99% white , officially support racial integration , applaud those of their churches that practice it , do not chide those that do n't . They see merit in testing the literal Bible by scholarship-yet many quietly hold that every word is true . They hearken more closely to Calvin than do their more numerous Northern Presbyterian cousins . They anxiously question the need to lose their identity in ecumenicism . Last week , though under the pervading pressures of world Christianity to become a bit more liberal , they stuck politely to their moderate views . <P> Meeting in Huntington , W. Va. , the denomination commissioners defeated scholarly Dr. Frank Caldwell , president of Louisville Theological Seminary , in his liberal bid for the top post of moderator . But to beat him , conservatives cautiously picked a man less distinguished for conservatism than for middle-of-the-road moderation . Squeaking in by a vote of 229 to 218 was the Rev. William H. McCorkle , 61 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for " higher life insurance . " <P> " Earlier in life I fought a constant inner urge to go into church work , " he recalls . " I was praying , but I did n't feel I was doing what the Lord wished me to do . One night I sat alone with the Bible and settled the matter . I wrote in the Bible , ' Tonight I give in . I 'll do whatever you want me to do . ' " He became one of the most decorated Navy chaplains of World War II . After collecting the Silver Star for tending a wounded marine under fire , McCorkle finished the war as an Annapolis chaplain . Now he tends a 1,100-member church in Bristol , Tenn. , and describes himself as a " garden variety pastor . " <P> If ecumenicism has to come , Southern Presbyterian conservatives prefer a face-saving union with the Reformed Church in America , a smaller , 230,210-member body concentrated in the Northeast and Midwest . Yet Moderator McCorkle is not an unyielding roadblock to unity : " Eventually I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families will be as one . " <P> The assembly rejected an overture by the Presbytery of Northwest Missouri to bar meetings in cities where discrimination is generally practiced in hotels and restaurants , reaffirmed their stand , first taken in 1954 , that calls enforced racial segregation " out of harmony with Christian theology and ethics . " And the commissioners did get around to some emancipating : by a vote of 249 to 173 , they approved a proposal for women to become ordained deacons , elders or ministers .
