 | Women Who Drink Too Ruch Behind the facade of comfortable homes and respectable job are thousands of women who need help ? desperately IN WEST VIRGINIA the wife of a traveling salesman spends Friday afternoon cooking dabs of various foods and putting them in dishes in the refrigerator . She is just groping her way out of four days of heavy drinking . She is fabricating leftovers so that , when her husband returns , he will think she has eaten something during the week . In California a young mother comes to from a blackout during a weekend of drinking when her husband has been away . She finds herself at an upstairs window , an empty box of crackers beside her . In the yard below , her two children are crying in their playpen . Bits of cracker litter the lawn ? her aim was not very good . She has no idea how long it has been since she fed the babies properly . This is the life , tragic beyond measure , of a woman alcoholic . Here is how a handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived for six long years in a small New York State city . Her husband had brought her there from Manhattan with their small son in the hope of " curing " her heavy drinking . " My husband was in charge of the second shift at the plant , so he 'd be at home mornings . I 'd fix breakfast . I 'd do laundry . I did more laundry  | than anyone in town ; this was to show him I felt fine . He 'd leave in the early afternoon , and I 'd feel off the hook for the moment . Then I 'd pretend I was a real member of the community . I 'd make a few phone calls . I 'd pick up Peter at kindergarten . I 'd chat with his teacher -- through the car window . I could n't get out of the car . I was sick all afternoon until I had a drink . " I always tried to wait until five . And people say alcoholics do n't have will power ! Then began the business of getting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle . By t lie time your husband has started marking the bottles , this becomes a life 's work . You drive across town to get new ones , and you 're always scared of being caught . " In New York I had always looked for occasions ' for drinking , but now I was n't bothering with that . Mostly I drank alone . I drank until I passed out . " The alcoholic , typically , will go to almost any length to pretend that his alcoholism is n't there . And if the alcoholic is a woman , the guilt that drives her to hide may be particularly heavy . Most people feel , and she feels cruelly herself , that she is betraying everything a woman should be ? wife , mother , keeper of the home , ideal of men . Of all alcoholics she is probably the most tragically hidden . The American Medical Association and other professional groups have now officially recognized alcoholism as a disease , for which no cause has been positively identified . Most psychiatrists feel that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an incomplete explanation . The best modern thinking is that alcoholism stems from a combination of psychological , social and physiological factors . Many kinds of people can be alcoholics ? the shy young housewife or the respectable grandmother . Sex , degree of wealth , even one 's moral upbringing have very little to do with it . Women alcoholics are protected by the privacy of home . But it is important to find them , to help them face realities . Just because they are women , the rules of alcoholism will not change . Unless they are helped to stop it short , their drinking is sure to be a long , slow descent into hell . In Ellen 's case , the psychological and social factors were glaring . She grew up with deep uncertainties about herself . " I was told I had no looks , no charm , no interest for anyone . " When she was i8 , she eloped with a young man whom her family regarded as so unsuitable that they disowned her . The marriage lasted less than a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with a New York night-club set that drank hard . To get gloriously high soon became the point of an evening out . By the time she was 20 she was familiar with the three-day hangover . She remarried at 25 . It was a wartime marriage and , when her husband was overseas , " my drink- ing got very bad . I was drunk most of the time . " When her husband removed her from Manhattan , she was already an alcoholic in the two crucial respects by which alcoholism is defined . She was using drink to meet almost every problem , and its use had gone far beyond her control , was blotting out her ability to function as a person , wife and mother . Ellen appears to be the classic case of a troubled girl in a drinking environment ? but what about Brenda ? Brenda 's father was a minister in an Indiana city ; the family atmosphere was one of intellectuality . " My parents expected me to go to college and have a career ? which is just what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had no more than a dozen drinks in her life . Yet the minute she found herself on her own , she almost flew to liquor . No one had to introduce her ; she discovered it by herself . For 20 years Brenda kept by day her status as a graduate student , then a teacher , later a government economist . At night , her occupation was drinking . " I 'd go home at five o'clock , lock the door ? I lived alone ? and start the rat race . I could n't have friends to dinner ? I 'd be drunk by the time they got there . My eccentricity was to pick up stray alley cats and take them home with me . I was so lonely , you see . " Or what about Alice ? Her girlhood was nothing like Brenda 's shy , only-child one . She was one of six children , pretty , popular and gay . Her father was a lawyer in Texas politics , and when she married , at 19 , the son of the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But her husband turned out to be a weakling , and when Alice divorced him it was a local scandal , damaging to her father 's political career . She went to San Francisco , " feeling that my life was really over . " Through her pluck , energy and charm , she earned her own living , made new friends . She remarried in her 30 's , this time into the sort of life she had been raised for . " I adored my husband . I had so much to live for , so little reason to drink ! We had a beautiful country place . I was helping raise three of my nieces and nephews ? we always had a houseful of young people . Life was never gayer or brighter . " I did n't admit for a moment that my drinking was a problem . But the drinking built up over a period of years . Eventually I was up to a quart a day . Once we were to give an important dinner party . I did n't take a drink all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra maid ; I had everything all ready . Then I took a drink . Then a second . When the guests arrived they were a blur . I led us all into the dining room very nicely , indicated where each guest was to sit ? and then sat down on the floor and could n't get up . " Statistics on the prevalence of alcoholism are necessarily estimates . According to Yale 's Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol , there are  | somewhat more than five million sufferers in the United States . How many women does this include ? Researchers , on the slim evidence available , have long held that there is one woman alcoholic for every five and a half men ? thus some three quarters of a million women . Yet there are those who suspect that the proportion of women is really much higher . They note , for example , that in big cities closed Alcoholics Anonymous meetings ? for alcoholics only ? are nearly evenly divided as to sex . And Dr. Ruth Fox , medical director of the National Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says , " In this past decade I have seen 1292 alcoholics ? 789 males and 503 females . I think this means that the figures around the country are way off . " How can the woman alcoholic be helped ? She and all those concerned for her need first the relief of knowing that alcoholism is a common , treatable disease , not a guilty sin . If the great burden of shame could be lifted from the word " alcoholism , " more women at an earlier stage might face their drinking patterns honestly . Many shy people take a drink or two at parties to thaw themselves out . But if , through compulsive drinking , a woman 's habitual behavior becomes embarrassing either to herself or to others , her drinks are creating more problems than they are solving . This is the time for her to stop completely . To do so , she needs to know the truly lethal effect of alcohol on alcoholics . If an alcoholic permits any alcohol at all to enter her system , she will be helpless before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such thing as the alcoholic who can safely drink . Few alcoholics can stop drinking all by themselves . They need the support of people who are willing to understand the magnitude of their battle . Ellen , Brenda and Alice eventually were guided into Alcoholics Anonymous . They came by slow and painful routes . Ellen finally landed in a hospital , with her husband telling her he wanted a divorce and custody of Peter . Ellen granted both . " Then one day a friend asked me if I was ready for A.A. I thought it was some kind of religion . But I was ready to try anything . " Ellen has not had a drink for five years now . She found that A.A. offered something that no medical or psychiatric help can give in such steady doses . " Its power is people . For the first time in many years I was a member of a community that understood and accepted me as I was . Oh , the relief ! " Brenda tried three different psychiatrists . The third said , " Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For two years . But after he dismissed me I thought I could drink again , and within a month I was back where I 'd started . " Then , one day , after she had read Marty Mann 's New Primer on Alco- holism , * she telephoned A.A. She was invited to attend a meeting that night , and was offered cab fare . Brenda was so touched by this offer that she went to the meeting . " I now go to meetings regularly , " she says . " I have n't had a drink in three years . " Alice says , " It was my husband who finally said to me , You go to A.A. ? or else ! ' Fear is not always a good motivation for alcoholics , but in my case it worked . I went for four months , reluctantly , and still drinking somewhat . I made a great show of being sober . But then I de-cided I did n't like myself very well . I began going to A.A. with a real willingness to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life far richer than it used to be . Ellen has bloomed in her work with a public-relations firm . She says , " Yes , there is a joy in sobriety ? but probably not the kind of joy most people imagine . It 's the joy of being able to cope with emotional problems . I used to be frightened to get on a bus by myself ! Now I take on all kinds of things . There is no sudden pride in this . The recovery of an alcoholic is the work of years .
