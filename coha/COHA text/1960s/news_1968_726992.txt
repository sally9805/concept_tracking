txt Senator Robert F. Kennedy said today that he could not support President Johnson for renomination and would decide in the next few days whether to enter the Oregon and California primaries as an active Presidential candidate . Late today , one of his principal advisers said it was likely that he would do so . But Senator Kennedy 's sudden projection of himself into Presidential discussion did not set off a bandwagon rush among other Democrats . A survey of Democratic members of Congress from 23 states , for instance , produced the general advice that he stay out of the primaries . The consensus of the survey was not that Mr. Kennedy should not seek the nomination . It was rather that he should go to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August unscarred by primary battles and ready to take command of a divided convention . Asks Kennedy Stay Out The Kennedy developments did not deter Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota from entering himself today in two more Democratic primaries ; in Indiana and South Dakota . Senator McCarthy , an announced candidate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Tuesday . He is entered in both the Oregon and California primaries . The Minnesota Senator expressed the wish today that Senator Kennedy stay out of the primaries . Then , he said , if his own bid failed at the Democratic ' National Convention in Chicago in August , the McCarthy delegates would be free to switch to Senator Kennedy . This statement was termed " Important and helpful " by a source close to Senator Kennedy , but there was no official reaction from the Kennedy office . In an interview . Senator Kennedy also suggested that he would like to cooperate with Senator McCarthy in trying to deny renomination to President Johnson . But he was vague about details of what he had in mind . The New Yorker did not foreclose the possibility that he might endorse Senator McCarthy 's candidacy , rather than mounting his own . Nor did he rule out some other course . But the greatest likelihood appeared to be that Mr. Kennedy would enter the Oregon and California contests and possibly the South Dakota primary . He has until March 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it has been placed by state officials . The Oregon primary is on May 28 , the California and South Dakota primaries on June 4 . Around the nation there was consternation in Democratic ranks . Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago , one of the most important Democratic leaders in the nation , issued a statement saying he would continue to support President Johnson . Mr. Kennedy said in the interview that he did not expect help from Mr. Daley . Gov . Harold E. Hughes of Iowa , a Senatorial candidate and a representative Midwestern Democrat , said he would " hate to see the Democratic party torn apart " by a Kennedy challenge for the nomination . Another Democratic Governor , who declined to speak for the record , said he had expected to head , an uncommitted but " pro-Johnson " delegation to the convention but was not sure that that would be possible if Mr. Kennedy became ? an active candidate . The Governor said Senator McCarthy would not , win : any delegates in his state . He added that he had not had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unruh Move Reported In California , Assembly Speaker Jesse M. Unruh , a powerful Democrat and a friend of the Kennedy family , was reported to be lining up a delegate slate on the Senator 's behalf . He was said to be making the argument to other Democrats that Mr. McCarthy had no chance for the nomination and that the Minnesotan 's " realistic " supporters would ultimately switch to Mr. Kennedy . California 's Attorney General Thomas Lynch , who heads the Johnson delegate slate , said he remained " strictly for Johnson " although he described himself as an " old friend " of Mr. Kennedy 's . California sources said Mr Unruh had recently commissioned a private poll tha showed that in a primary race against a McCarthy slate and the Johnson slate that would be headed by Mr. Lynch , Sena tor Kennedy would get 46 per cent of the vote , the Lynch slate 21 per cent and Mr. McCarthy 13 per cent , with the rest undecided . A Democratic party chairman in a major Eastern state said privately that it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said one of the things he was thinking about was the question whether Mr. McCarthy 's strong showing in New Hampshire meant that President Johnson could be defeated in November . If so , he said , Mr. Kennedy 's rationale might be that it would be easier to replace Mr. McCarthy as the anti-Johnson candidate now than after Mr. McCarthy had campaigned in other primaries . He expressed a doubt that appeared widespread among Democrats  --  that Mr. McCarthy can win the nomination away from the President , even if the latter is unusually vulnerable . Goodwin 's View Richard N. Goodwin of the faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , once an assistant to President Johnson , more recently a McCarthy campaign worker in New Hampshire and always a close associate of the Kennedy family , said that at least until Mr. Kennedy made his intentions clear " I intend to go to Wis-I cousin and help win the primary " for Mr. McCarthy . Mr. Kennedy can not legally enter the Wisconsin primary , on April 2 , for which the filing deadline was Feb. 29 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , which borders Minnesota . Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon telephoned Mr. Kennedy from Portland to warn him that if he entered the primary in that state , and if Mr. McCarthy stayed in , they would throw the state to President Johnson . Mr. Morse , like the other two senators , is an outspoken critic of the Vietnam war . From the Republican side , only one prominent voice was heard . Representative Gerald R. Ford of Michigan , the House minority leader , said he believed Mr. Kennedy was interested in the Vice Presidency " if he can get together with Lyndon Johnson . " Asked if he thought a partnership between Mr. Johnson the war President and Mr. Kennedy the war critic was feasible , Mr. Ford said both men were " practical politicians , and strange combinations have been put together in the past . " That particular combination would be regarded as very strange by Mr. Johnson 's political advisers , who were expressing fears today that Mr. Kennedy 's entrance into the primaries ? would produce a " nasty fight " that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These sources said Mr. Johnson still had no plans to campaign in Wisconsin but that he and his aides would take closer personal direction of his campaign than they had done in New Hampshire . There were no indications as yet of any major strategy change by the Johnson forces . Like other politicians , they were busy trying to assess Mr. Kennedy 's intentions and possible impact on the race . They were also busy pointing to the statements by Mayor Daley and Governor Hughes . Johnson sources said also that former Mayor John V. Kenny of Jersey City , a powerful Democratic leader in New Jersey , would stand behind the President . No Signs of Backing Away Other than for Mr. McCarthy 's suggestion that his delegates might ultimately go to Mr. Kennedy , if the latter did not contest the primaries , the McCarthy camp showed no signs of backing away from a contest . The Senator 's formal entry into the Indiana and South Dakota primaries were the best evidence of this . He said he had planned to do so before Mr. Kennedy 's interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect was to assure that no primaries would be open for Mr. Kennedy to be a lone anti-Johnson candidate . Mr. McCarthy 's entry into Indiana  --  the primary will be on May 7 ? could precipitate an'other clash with Mr. Johnson , whatever Mr. Kennedy does . In that state Gov . Roger D. Branigin , a Democrat , is considering running as a stand-in for the President . But another result of contested primaries in Indiana and South Dakota might be to make Senators Birch Bayh of Indiana ' and George of South Dakota , both Democrats , choose sides . This could damage their own re-election campaigns , lboth of which are regarded as I close . The major problem produced by Mr. Kennedy 's re-examina'tion of his Presidential prospects and Mr. McCarthy 's adamancy is that in a threecornered campaign with Mr. Johnson or a stand-in for him , they would split the anti-John , son vote , McCarthy supporters pointed out that Mr. Kennedy had made no move to enter the race until the New Hampshire primary had demonstrated a strong potential for an anti-Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal fervor that no one really believed Mr. McCarthy could win the nomination from the President or defeat the Republican candidate in the fall campaign . Mr. Kennedy himself said today that it would be " conceivable but damned tough " for anyone " to put it all together " and defeat the President at the national convention . Asked if he believed he had a better chance to do so than Mr. McCarthy , he said that he " would n't he considering doing it " if he did n't think he " had something to contribute . " The conversation with Mr. Kennedy left no doubt that he had , made a personal decision Ito enter in some fashion the ' intraparty struggle over the war in Vietnam , and other issues . This was the context in which he said , " Obviously , I ca n't support the President . " There was no suggestion , however , that he was thinking of bolting the party in case the President won the nomination at Chicago . What Mr. Kennedy and his , associates are still mulling over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to help deny the nomination to , the President . Both he and his closest advisers made it plain that the most likely decision would be for him to enter the California and Oregon primaries , and perhaps the South Dakota primary . But Theodore C. Sorensen , who was special counsel to President Kennedy and who was in Washington today as an adviser to Robert Kennedy , said there was still a Kennedy I faction ? including Mr. Sorensen  --  urging " the political realities " upon the Senator . This was not a matter of urging him not to run , Mr. Sorensen , now a Manhattan lawyer , said ; it was more nearly a matter of trying to channel his strong impulse to run into the most constructive course . Mr. Kennedy and all his supporters are describing him as under a " moral compulsion " to play a part in the party struggle on Vietnam . Thus , they say , his " reconsideration " of his own role began with the success of the Communist Tet offensive , and was given impetus by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier this week . This testimony left Mr. Kennedy with no hope for a change ' in policy by the Johnson Administration , he said today . It coincided with Mr. McCarthy 's strong showing in the New Hampshire primary , demonstrating that the Democratic party was divided whether or not Mr. ' Kennedy got into the race . Last November , in asserting , on a television program that he ' would not be a Presidential candidate , Mr. Kennedy said : " It would immediately become a struggle between President Johnson and me , as an overly ambitious figure trying to take the nomination away from President Johnson , who deserves it because of the fact that he is not only President but served the Democratic party and the country as President for four or five years . " The Senator said today , however , that the New Hampshire results had shown that he could run against Mr. Johnson without incurring such criticism . At the same time , he continued , the " turnaround " in the public view of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been urging him not to enter the Presidential race . He denied that in a meeting with Senator McCarthy yesterday he had told the Minnesotan that he ? Mr. Kennedy  --  would make a more effective candidate . He said he had congratulated Mr. McCarthy on his New Hampshire showing and expressed . the hope that if both ran in the California and Oregon primaries there would be no animosity between them . The " important thing , " Mr. Kennedy said , perhaps in explanation of his hope for cooperative action with Mr. McCarthy , is " to get enough votes against . what we 're doing at the moment . " This was a reference to the Johnson Administration 's policy in Vietnam . Mr. Kennedy apparently meant that even if he and Mr. McCarthy split the vote against President Johnson , their combined total would still demonstrate the extent of anti-Johnson , antiwar sentiment . He and his associates regard such a demonstration as more important than the delegates to be won by primary victories .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
