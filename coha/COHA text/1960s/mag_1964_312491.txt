U.S. newspapers , magazines , radio and TV were n't expected to observe the month-long moratorium on politicking , since they analyze and sift the political winds the year round . If the U.S. press seemed to be treading lightly on the subject of politics after President Kennedy 's death , that was only because most politicians were n't giving them much to report-except Lyndon Johnson , who is already a past master at combining the nation 's interests and his party 's fortunes . <P> Thus , when the moratorium ended last week , it was hardly surprising that the press leaped enthusiastically back into the business of keeping the current political score . With undisguised impatience , the New York Daily News exhorted Republicans " to make up for lost time " and also suggested a first move : " An all-out attack on Chief Justice Earl Warren 's commission to investigate the Kennedy murder , plus a drive to persuade Congress to give Warren &; Co. the heave . " So that none of its readers would miss the point , the News detailed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earl Warren Supreme Court 's long-standing tenderness toward Communists , any report this commission may give birth to will be open to suspicion of pro-Communist and anti-conservative bias . " <P> Out of Action . With President Johnson a seeming cinch to lead the Democratic Party 's campaign in 1964 , most newspapers went elephant hunting-and found plenty of game . Columnist Roscoe Drummond reignited the torch that he has been carrying all fall . " The unresolved question " about Henry Cabot Lodge , U.S. Ambassador to South Viet Nam , wrote Drummond , " is not whether Mr. Lodge is going to resign his ambassadorship and become an open , active and campaigning candidate for the nomination-but when . " In some quarters , added Drummond hopefully , Lodge was considered " a more formidable contender " than Nixon , Goldwater or Scranton . <P> Senator Goldwater was widely , and perhaps prematurely , held to have been nudged well out of the action . " The Draft Barry Goldwater Drive moved forward again , " reported Richard T. Stout of the Chicago Daily News , " but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissenters from this view , among them U.S. News &; World Report , which declared that the U.S. Senator from Arizona " remains out in front as the truce ends . " <P> <P> On the other hand , Pennsylvania Governor William Scranton , heretofore a reluctant possibility , now seemed to some editorial analysts to have moved a lot nearer the money . Said the New York Herald Tribune : " He appears to have just the combination of qualities , both personal and political , that the Republican Party needs to oppose Lyndon Johnson . " <P> <P> All-inclusive . Governor Scranton was just one of a bevy of Republican presidential contenders whom pundits measured like handicappers at a racetrack . Sample form sheet , from Scripps-Howard Correspondent Jack Steele : " Goldwater still the front runner . . . Rocke feller 's chances seem to have been helped little , if any , by the sag in Goldwater 's fortunes . . . Nixon has gained most on the surface , but has stirred little enthusiasm among party pros . " As for Scranton and Ambassador Lodge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of voters . "
