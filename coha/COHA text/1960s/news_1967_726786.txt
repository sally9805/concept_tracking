txt On March 24 , 1966 , Mayor Lindsay called a news conference to make this announcement : " The city has a plan to speed the construction of a new Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx . The plan will cut through the red tape and eliminate unnecessary delays that have marked construction of public facilities in the past . By speeding action at every possible point , we plan to complete the construction of Lincoln Hospital in five years . " City officials interviewed last week , more than 20 months later , said they " hoped " the hospital would be completed five years from now . Herman Badillo , Bronx Borough President , said that the proposed hospital was only one of 12S capital budget projects : hat behind sch. - Atile in " There is money in the capital budget for every one of them ? some of the projects have been budgeted since 1964  --  but nothing is being done . Nothing is being built . " As a Democrat and a possible future candidate for Mayor , Mr. Badillo can not be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem he is discussing is classically nonpartisan . For as long as any city employe can remember there has been a frustrating lag between the time money is allocated in the capital budget for a construction project and the time a hospital , school , park or firehouse is actually completed . Many agencies get involved in every city job . Meridian Management Company , which is studying Iriethods to speed up construction for the Bureau of the Budget , estimates that 12 to 20 departments are involved in most projects and that from 167 to 300 operations must be handled between a capital budget allocation and the completion of a project . The nature of most of those operations was revealed by Richard Shively , general manager of Meridian , who said the best way to speed up a city project was to have one man assigned " to hand-carry the papers from one guy to the next . " At the moment , according to the City Planning Commission , the city has still failed to spend $1.2-billion allocated for construction in past capital budgets . The capital budget-64 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's listing of funds to be spent for public construction , building repairs and equipment purchases . After considering requests from municipal departments and borougk presidents , the planning commission prepares a document that must be approved by the Mayor , City Council and Board of Estimate . Two Separate Budgets The 1967-68 capital budget , which covers the year beginning last July 1 , lists $1,058 , - 775,797 appropriated for more than 600 projects . The capital budget now being prepared for 1968-69 is expected to be just under $1-billion . ( The capital budget is separate from the city 's expense , or operating budget , which totaled $5.2-billion for 1967-68 . ) The 128 precincts in the Bronx range from Lincoln Hospital , which it is estimated will eventually cost $75-million , to three bus shelters costing a total of $5,000 on Pelham Parkway . The three-sided wooden shelters , which are expected to take 30 days to build , have been in the budget since July 1 , 1966 , The Parks Department , which has the primary responsibility for the construction of the shelters near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later this month . Illustration of Duplication " We hope construction can begin this winter , " said a department official , who asked not to be identified . " I do n't know why it took this long . " Look , we work in a bureaucracy , there 's a lot of papers , a lot of red tape , a lot of other agencies got Involved in this : the Transit Authority , the Bureau of the Budget , the Department of Water Supply , Gas and Electricity , a lot . " Another indication of the problems of the bureaucracy is the fact that Meridian employes spent three months early this year studying the capital budget problem before they learned that City Administrator Timothy W. Costello 's staff had been doing the same thing for a year . The offices of both Meridian and the City Administrator are at 250 Broadway . Dr. Costello and Mr. Shively Independently came to the same conclusion  --  that many of the hundreds of separate operations being handled one by one could be done at the same time . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained capital budget projects in Bronx are not being built . a hospital could submit his preliminary plans for review by the Hospitals Department and the Bureau of the Budget at the same time . In the past , the architect delivered the plans to the Hospitals Department , which had to approve them and deliver them to the Budget Bureau . The advent of simultaneous  --  or parallel  --  operations has speeded construction schedules by about 10 per cent this year , according to Mr. Shively . " But almost all projects run into snags , " he said . " It 's like poking a big elephant  --  we 've got it standing , but it certainly is n't moving yet . " Mr. Badillo , who was . Relocation Commissioner under former Mayor Robert F. Wagner , said that capital budget projects moved faster under the Democratic Mayor . " Most ? of them  --  maybe 90 per cent  --  were behind schedule under Wagner , but ' a few were pushed because every Commissioner knew the Mayor was behind them . " Mayor Lindsay said , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of such techniques as parallel operations and the efforts of , his new . Public Works Commissioner , Eugene E .. , Hult . But he ' did not mininiize the magnitude of . the problem . " Sure it takes too long , " the Mayor said . " It always has within memory and still does despite our intention and intensive effort to speed things up . " This is one of the vexing frustrations of . government . Everything should be done faster but there are too many political and bureaucratic hindrances , delays and obstructions . It 's an unending fight and we are fighting it constantly . " A Case in Point The parallel submission procedure developed in Dr. Costello 's office was tried for the first time on the Lincoln Hospital job . But , although the nine-acre site was acquired at the same time that early planning of the building was done , the schedule announced by Mayor Lindsay fell apart , partly because of nine months of discussions over how many beds the hospital should have . The Mayor announced the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a 920-bed hospital . In separate interviews this week , Commissioner Hult , whose department is respon-sible building , said there , would be 950 beds and Dr. Costello said there would be 925 . A Department ' of Hospitals spokesman finally said he was n't sure how many beds there ' would be . " That hospital 's been in bad shape for quite a while , " he said . " There 's a lot of red tape involved . You 'll have to talk to Public Works to find out what 's going on . " For his part , Mr. Hult said : " We 're almost ready to break into preliminary planning . Public works does the planning and supervises the design and construction . 1 do n't know what held everything up . You 'll have to talk to hospitals about that . " Costs Go Up and Up During the discussions , in which Federal and state health agencies also took part , the estimated cost of the hospital climbed with rising construe tion costs . When Lincoln Hospital was placed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The 1967-68 figure is $66,742,000 , of which $3,690,000 is now allocated . The Department of Hospitals proposed figure for the 1968.69 budget is $74,452,000 . Because of the accelerated program , progress is visible at the new hospital 's site , an area bounded by Park and Morris Avenues ' and 145th and 149th Streets . " Keep Off ? Department of Real Estate " signs guard vacant stores and small apartment houses as two bulldozers move the debris of already demolished buildings . During three interviews about the Bronx projects , Mr. Badillo repeatedly said that the city needed a top-ranking official whose sole duty would be to supervise capital projects . Mr. Shively proposed middle-management level " project managers , " each of wham : would be responsible for the progress of from , 6 to 10 projects . betting Things Done " We need a deputy mayor for construction , " the Borough President said .

" We ca n't complain about the middle class fleeing the city when we 're not doing the things that a normal citizen has the right to expect ? building schools and libraiietr ' There are 23 new Bronx Schools  --  listed in this year 's capital budget . Complaints about the ' length of time it takes to build them have come up again and again at a series of community meetings that Mr. Badillo has sponsored . Cites Student Need At a meeting last month in Christopher Columbus High School , Mrs. ' . Mary A. Shaw talked about ' the need for the proposed Herbert 1-1 ,  --  ; Lehman High . School ' to bursts : applause from . an audience of several hundred ' residents of " the northeast Bronx . " This school was built ' for 1,800 students , " she . said of Columbus High . " Now it has 3,300 on double session . We needed the new school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and nine months on design and I hear they 're arguing about where to put the music room . We could n't care less where they put the music department . . . Our children need a new school . " , The $13-million Lehman High School  --  which is to be built partly on a platform above the Hutchison River . Parkway , at Tremont Avenue ? first appeared in the capital budget on July 1 . " We have approval for preliminary plans on that school and we 're ready to go , into contract plans , " said , Arthur Palette , superintendent of construction for , the Board of Education. ? " There were many problems , many people had to be brought together . We hope to put bids out in November of 1968 . " Lights for Baseball A smaller item which went into the budget on July 1 , 1966 was $112,500 for lights at two baseball diamonds in Franz Sigel Park at the Grand Concourse and 153rd Street . " We started moving on baseball lights last spring , " the unidentified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot  --  of paperwork'and design involved and you have to go back and forth with Budget and - with Water Supply , Gas and Electricity . I hope we can get those lights up soon . " In a memo to the City Planning Commission two years ago , Arthur F. Klein , supervisor for plans and construction of the Metropolitan Museum of Art summarized the back and forth movement involved in any ' capital budget project . Mr. Klein outlined 39 major steps from the budget allocation to awarding of construction contrarts . Six of the steps were : ( 4 ) Agency prepares preliminary design contract ; ( 5 ) Agency submits preliminary design contract to Mayor 's office ; ( 6 ) Mayor 's office refers preliminary design : contract to Budget Director 's office ; ( 7 ) Budget Director 's office refers . preliminary design contracts to Mayor 's ' office ; ( 8 ) Mayor , approves preliminary design contract bYlertificate ; . ( 9 ) - Agency awards preliminary design conThe steps are then roughly repeated four times with the rd " preliminary design con-wtraocts tract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " final design contract , " " final design drawings " and " bids . " The papers go back to the Bureau of the Budget at least four times ' during the months a capital project is moving . The procedure ' was established , as Mr. Klein wrote , " to assure the people of the City of New York that the capital improvements are being done under a system of scrutiny which would eliminate unfair practices , collusion and acts which would result in the improvements being higher In cost and lower in quality . " One high city finance official viewed the constant auditing of capital projects by the Budget ' Bureau , " Comptroller 's office and sponsoring agency this ' The whole system is designed to protect the public against Boss , Tweed . It 's protection against huge graft . The only trouble is ' that the delays Ind paperwork cost more than any civil servants could possibly steal . "
