TWO more dissimilar Olympians would be hard to imagine . Al Oerter is 32 and white , a hulking 260-pounder who lives with his wife and two children on suburban Long Island and works as supervisor of the computer communications department at Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp . Bob Beamon is 22 , black and bearded , a gangling 160-lb. product of the streets of New York who attends the University of Texas at El Paso on a track scholarship-and says that he would rather be playing basketball . Last week in Mexico City , each in his own way demonstrated what the Olympic Games are all about . Oerter , the proud veteran , hurled the discus 212 ft. 6 in. , five feet farther than he had ever thrown it in his life . He set a Games record and became the first trackman ever to win his event in four successive Olympics . Beamon , the precocious newcomer , competing in his first Olympics , leaped 29 ft. 2 in. on his very first try , to smash the world long-jump record by an improbable margin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special inspiration at the Olympics , " says Oerter . It is an inspiration that has driven him to triumph over his own physical limitations . Not once has Oerter gone to an Olympics as a favorite . In 1956 at Melbourne , the U.S. 's Fortune Gordien was picked to win ; in 1960 at Rome , Rink Babka , another American , expected to take the gold medal ; in 1964 at Tokyo , CzechoSlovakia 's Ludvik Danek was the reigning world recordholder . Last week the man to beat was the U.S. 's Jay Silvester , who only a month before had broken the world mark with a prodigious heave of 224 ft. 5 in . Oerter defeated them all , despite the fact that ever since 1963 he has been suffering from a slipped cervical disc that causes him agony and forces him to wear a surgical collar when he competes . In the Olympics , however , he takes the collar off . " These are the Olympics , " he explains . " You die for them . " <P> At Tokyo , Oerter had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hemorrhaging from a ripped rib cartilage , and still he set an Olympic mark of 200 ft. 1 in . In Mexico City , he slipped in the rain-soaked discus ring and tore a thigh muscle . Relaxants and ice treatments numbed the pain for the finals , and on his third toss he won his fourth gold medal . Oerter immediately began thinking ahead to Munich in 1972-and the possibility of a fifth title . " I think I can continue to improve until I 'm 40 or so , " he said . <P> The Olympic long jump was supposed to be a two-man contest between the U.S. 's Ralph Boston and Russia 's Igor Ter-Ovanesyan , coholders of the world record ( 27 ft. 4 in . ) . Beamon 's unpolished jumping style made purists shudder and write off as a fluke his indoor world record of 27 ft. 2 in. last March . Sometimes he took off from his right foot , sometimes from his left . He often did not bother to count his strides on the approach . In the qualification trials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the finals on his last try .
