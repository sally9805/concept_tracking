If the thronlbosis is found to be extra-cranial outside the cranial area of the brain , an operation is possible . If it is intra-cranial , Salinger said the doctors explained , you can not operate . An operation might have been required , some medical authorities said , had it been necessary to relieve pressure on the brain from blood flowing from a burst vessel , to take out a blood clot , or possibly to tie off a bleeding vessel . Parted in Morning Kennedy made a rush return trip to West Palm Beach less than a dozen hours after his father had waved him cheerily on the way to Washington this morning .

By that time , Kennedy was at his desk in Washington and his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news to him by telephone shortly after noon . At 4 o'clock , the White House announced that Kennedy planned to leave an hour later to hasten back to Florida . Ho did n't get away quite that fast .

Again tonight , as on the trip from Palm Beach to Washington this mornin g , the plane cabin was pressurized at sea level although it flew at 22,000 feet . Usually the pressure is kept around a 2,500-foot level and bringing it down to zero was designed to case the cold . Aids said the condition is considerably better . Key Aids Make Trip Before leaving Washington , Kennedy had met for 55 minutes with the National  --  Seenrity council . He brought with him on the flight to Florida two key aids , Theodore K.

One change was announced in Washington : The lighting of the Christmas tree on the ellipse of the White House , traditionally done by the President , will be ierformed by a substitute . Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson will turn on the lights at dusk tomorrow . Financed Son 's Campaign Possibly no other father in history ever played such a major role in making his son President as did Joseph P. Kennedy . He not only supplied that incredible , competitive drive ? " I do n't think Much of people who have it in them to be first but who finish second , " fie said  --  but he also came thru with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation 's richest men ; who made possible the long , tedious , expensive primary campaign that led to the Democratic nomination for his son . At a time when many business men looked upon Franklin D. Roosevelt with horror , Kennedy supported him vocally and financially . In turn , Kennedy got the support of Roosevelt ? he was named head of the Maritime commission , head of the Securities Exchange commission , ambassador to Great Britain during World War II . Despite his early support of Roosevelt , he became identified as a conservative . Indeed , one of the objections to his son , John , was that he might be dominated by a too conservative father . So during the political campaign little was seen of Joe Kennedy . Undoubtedly he conferred with his son often . But he stayed so discreetly in the background that reporters covering the candidate rarely if ever saw him . President 's Father Suffers StrokeCAP tVtrenhoiol Joseph P.
