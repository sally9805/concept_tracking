Bossy cow cow Honey bee bee Oleomargarine oleobutterine Alfalfa-hey ! <P> Only a cow college could boast a cheer like that , and only the University of California could boast a cow college like Davis . Northernmost of Cal 's nine campuses , Davis is the M.I.T. of California agriculture . <P> Now , growing at a dizzy rate on the Central Valley flatlands near Sacramento , Davis aims to be something more : a first-rate university with a vast campus of 3,710 acres . Already it has 4,900 students and 300,000 books ; soon it will triple both , becoming the rural rival of Cal 's urban jewels , Berkeley and U.C.L.A. <P> " Cal Aggie Spirit . " Davis began in 1905 as Berkeley 's farm . Ag students went up there , 60 miles north , to practice planting and harvesting . As mass-farming grew , Davis trained managers and technicians ; to broaden their education , it opened a liberal arts college in 1951 . Then in 1959 , to help accommodate California 's burgeoning college population , Davis was spun off entirely from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now has graduate students in 118 fields , from art to range management to thermodynamics . A thriving new engineering college is keyed to California 's thriving aerospace industry . By 1965 , Davis will boast the world 's largest colony of subhuman primates ( 10,000 animals for biomedical research ) and a Big Science cyclotron costing $2,257,000 . By 1970 , it expects to have law and medical schools . <P> With its " Cal Aggie spirit " - corn- fed coeds , boys in cowboy boots , and an honored honor system-rural Davis seems almost anachronistic in the age of urban universities . That is precisely its pitch . " Our isolation is important , " says genial Chancellor Emil Mrak , 62 , a noted food technologist who used to teach at Berkeley . To justify his $10 million-a-year building program , Mrak has only to point at California 's jammed cities and freeways . Davis appeals as an oasis-part farm , part suburbia-where everyone still knows everyone else . Cars are disdained in favor of bicycles , a 700-lb. pig snuffles outside the chancellor 's window , new dormitories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human-scale motto is " divide and congeal . " <P> Space to Think . Davis is not about to drop its super-cow-college learning . Foreign students ( a high 10% of enrollment ) are there mainly for that purpose . California 's $3 billion-a-year farm industry still needs trained talent . But Davis now has more than twice as many liberal arts students as regular aggies . Engineering enrollment has jumped 48% in the past year . Like all Cal campuses , Davis takes only the top 12% of California high school students ( out-of-staters need a B+ average ) . One result : a new Phi Beta Kappa chapter . Another : Cal President Clark Kerr 's own son attends Davis .
