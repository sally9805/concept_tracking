At 2:30 a.m. one day last week , the U.S. finally found some allies in its struggle to prevent chaos and Communism in the Dominican Republic . By a narrow 14-5 vote , barely enough for the required two-thirds majority , the Organization of American States , meeting in Washington , agreed to create the hemisphere 's first inter-American military force and send it to help U.S. troops keep peace in Santo Domingo . Argentina , Brazil , Colombia , Costa Rica , Panama and Honduras swiftly laid plans to send contingents of men . Other nations would follow their lead . <P> More than that , the OAS was now talking of sending a team of distinguished Latin Americans to act as trustees in the Dominican Republic 's foundering political affairs . The team would possibly be composed of three former chiefs of state : Venezuela 's Rmulo Betancourt , Costa Rica 's Jos Figueres , Puerto Rico 's Muoz Marin . Their mission : to organize a provisional government and oversee a return to some sort of democratic normalcy in that confused , sorely wounded little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic decision for the OAS . It came only after a week of spectacular , sometimes desperate maneuvering in the halls of the Pan American Union , the White House , the United Nations and key Latin American capitals . In seeking Latin America 's aid , the U.S. left no doubt about its determination to carry on alone-uncomfortable though that might be . A presidential adviser put it bluntly . " At one point , Hitler was in a Munich beer hall with only seven people . Somewhere along the line we missed taking action . Never again . " <P> The U.S. was accused of blatant imperialism , of cynical intervention in the affairs of a helpless neighbor , of violating every tradition of the OAS . Sitting in his Puerto Rican exile , deposed Dominican President Juan Bosch blamed the U.S. for all the trouble . " This was a democratic revolution smashed by the leading democracy of the world ! " he cried . " I belong to a world that has ended politically . " <P> A Charter Violation . The Dominican revolution was hardly democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Latin American world that often closed its eyes to Castro Communism . In a strictly legalistic sense , the swift U.S. response indeed violated Articles 15 and 17 of the OAS charter , prohibiting military intervention in one state by another . Yet from its very birth the OAS has been nothing if not an instrument for hemispheric peace and security ( see box ) . Moreover , a 1954 resolution adopted at Caracas took the first tentative step toward defining the Communist menace .
