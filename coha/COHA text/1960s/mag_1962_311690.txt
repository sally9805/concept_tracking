" What is poetry ? Why , sir , " roared Dr. Johnson to his ever-attentive Boswell , " we all know what light is , but it is not easy to tell what it is . . . It is much easier to say what it is not . " <P> Poetry is not , unfortunately , what most poets are writing in English today . In the last 20 years , the English-speaking world has produced no major poet and scarcely a score of those minor bards who assiduously tune the lyre of language till another great man is ready to take it up . But if quality is lacking , quantity is not . In the 16 years since World War II , more poems have been composed in the U.S.-last year more than 200,000 were submitted for publication-than were written in ten centuries between Beowulf and the Bomb ; and in Britain , poetic production has approximately doubled in a decade . What 's more , sales of poetry on records are tuned to unprecedented volume . U.S. poetry buffs have bought 50,000 platters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late Dylan Thomas reading Dylan Thomas . And poetry readings have been box office in the U.S. for the first time since Oscar Wilde took lily in hand and plunged into the cultural night of Illinois . <P> The Revolution . Along with poetry 's popularity , and adding to it , has come a striking change in poetry 's style and content , a vigorous evolution that may yet become the second great poetic revolution of the century . The first revolution , which rolled over the language during the decade beginning in 1910 , was an American revolution , a revolt of the vernacular launched by Ezra Pound , T. S. Eliot and Robert Frost-all of them still alive and writing , but not writing much . In the early ' 30s , the heirs of the revolution , led by Britain 's W. H. Auden , turned to what Poet Archibald MacLeish called the " invocation to the social muse . " <P> But as the ' 30s stumbled toward catastrophe , poetry blundered deeper into obscurity and ambiguity , into the talented but precious minutiae of Wallace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrimshaw , a cathedral carved in a cherry pit . Poetry became a world unto itself , a self-sealing vacuum in which poets engaged in a conspiracy of mutual approval , safe from the embarrassing questions of the bewildered public , safe from what Poet Stefan George called " the indignity of being understood . " <P> Two events smashed this intellectual trade union : 1 ) a beery , gusty , word-wildered Welshman named Dylan Thomas and 2 ) World War II . Poet Thomas , with his golden rain of words and his great brass gong of a voice , reminded poetry of its origins in ritual and chant . And the war forced poets to face political , social and spiritual realities . At first , the horror of it all seemed to numb them ; the war itself produced no genuinely great poetry in English . But such poets as Karl Shapiro , Randall Jarrell , Richard Eberhart and Britain 's Henry Treece were moved to describe their military experiences in rough-edged verse that some did not like but all could understand . Suddenly the poets were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept right on communicating .
