Just as secular schools have discovered the need for " new math " and " new reading , " churches have had to devise new ways of teaching religion . No U.S. denomination has spent more time and money ( $5,000,000 ) solving the problem than the 3,227,157-member Lutheran Church in America , which last week introduced the most modern and most comprehensive Christian education program in the nation 's history . <P> Nine years in the making , the Lutheran Long Range Program combines sound scholarship , modern educational theory and a correlated curriculum for every teaching agency of the church . The aim is to provide a cradle-to-the-grave " life involvement " with religion , and the more than 400 texts range from colorfully illustrated kindergarten paperbacks to bibliography-laden study books for adult courses . The lessons have been carefully geared to the learning capacities and interests of the students . Thus for eight-year-olds , who are learning how to play and live equably with classmates , the title of the Sunday church school book is Fellow Workers for God . If they attend a vacation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World . <P> Modern in Tone . For some Lutheran conservatives , the curriculum is almost painfully modern in tone . There is a candid text for teen-age students on Love , Sex , and Life , and a seventh-grade Sunday school course on the Gospels admits that there is a considerable discrepancy among the Evangelists ' accounts of the Resurrection . Another seventh grade text explains the grandeur of God by making this comparison : " When you stand before a 6-ft. 10-in. basketball player , you feel like a runt . " <P> At all levels , teaching material has been carefully vetted in the interests of interfaith good will . Biweekly newspapers for children will describe Jewish feasts of the season , and explain what the Vatican Council means to Roman Catholics . Says Dr. W. Kent Gilbert , executive secretary of the Board of Parish Education and director of the project : " It is an attempt to understand what the beliefs of others are , rather than try to render judgments about people . " <P> Church-Tested . Gilbert says that the ultimate success or failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000 , when three-year-olds now learning about God will have become church leaders . But the Lutherans have painstakingly tested it . For four years draft texts were tried out in 62 congregations , and rewritten in the light of weekly critical reports submitted by the churches . The pilot parishes reported that their teen-age group classes went up in attendance as the program unfolded .
