DEAR SIRS : You merit respect as veteran opponents of capital punishment and no doubt hoped to advance the abolitionist cause with your editorial on " Playing God " The Nation , Sept. 2 . Alas , your means betrayed your purpose . Dragging Pat Brown out of his deserved obscurity to say a few words against legal mui der is the rough equivalent of asking Humphrey for his mature reflections on self-reliance , or inviting Curtis LeMay to lecture on the sanctity of life . By his own admission , Brown refused to stand between the gas chamber and forty-two of the sixty victims whose cases came before him as governor of California A " notably kindly " man , you say ? When you come right down to it , a weeping executioner is more offensive than an impassive professional . And were Brown also to repent  --  now that political pressures have subsided  --  of having supported Johnson 's war , having sent cops onto the Berkeley campus , having smeared an opponent for " being soft on homosexuals , " this would hardly make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will to destruction followed by prudently deferred regrets  --  this has by now become an established tradition in the Democratic Center So Brown , stripped of his power , now wishes that he " had commuted every single one " of the capital punishment cases .

DEAR SIRS : Those who oppose the election of Humphrey are burying the second Reconstruction . This is 1876 and Nixon is Hayes , though not as kind or honest . The sellout of the first Reconstruction caused more American deaths than the Vietnamese War  --  and among both races ; the end of the second will cause even more .

EDITORIALS As We See It Most voters are understandably unhappy with the three leading Presidential contenders , Nixon , Humphrey and Wallace . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast " against " rather than " for . " Even many of those who vote for Wallace and LeMay  --  at least outside the Deep South  --  will be casting protest votes . Comments on the choice offered voters range from " dismal " ( Walter Lippmann ) and " distasteful " ( Tom Wicker of The New York Times ) to the unprintable . Apart from the Wallace constituency , those who have decided to vote despite their dismay and distress will be influenced in the main by one or the other of the following arguments . Some feel , as Mr. Lippmann does , that the Republican Party , even with Nixon at the helm , is better able to govern than the tired , discredited , sharply divided Democratic Party . Others argue ? David Broder is one  --  that in the unhappy situation in which most voters now find themselves the man is more important than the party . Mr. Broder is impressed by the fact that " from the rich array of talent in the Republican Party , Richard Nixon chose Spiro T. Agnew for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed ruins of the Democratic Party , Hubert Humphrey found Edmund S. Muskie . " While The Nation is inclined to agree with much of what Mr. Lippmann has to say about the Republican Party , if we were to make a selection on the basis of likability , we could discover in ourselves a preference for Humphrey and Muskie . But a central issue in this year 's election transcends parties and personalities . In the 1964 campaign the electorate was offered what it had every right to assume was a choice  --  not an echo  --  on the vital issue of the war in Vietnam . The choice seemed clear-cut : a military victory through escalation ( Goldwater ) or " no wider war " ( Johnson ) , which implied an honest effort to seek settlement through negotiation . The electorate gave Johnson an overwhelming mandate to pursue the policy he had unambiguously stated , but even before Election Day he had quietly set in motion preparations for escalation . In retrospect , the dubious Gulf of Tonkin resolution , so frequently cited as the basic authorization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning for the unannounced course of action he had determined to follow . A self-respecting electorate would be most unwise to permit such a deliberate deception on a matter involving the honor and security of the United States to go unrebuked . We recognize , with Lincoln , that an element of moral ambiguity may be inherent in politics , but there are limits beyond which ambiguity can not be made to stretch . We consider the President 's deception about his intentions in 1964 to be an affront to the ethics of political leadership in a democratic society . We could not possibly have endorsed President Johnson if he had sought re-election , regardless of whom the Republicans might have nominated . Nor can we endorse Vice President Humphrey , even though Richard Nixon is his principal opponent . We have not forgotten that when the Administration  --  with the cooperation of N.B.C. ? decided to rebuke Martin Luther King after he had come out against the Vietnamese War , it was Mr. Humphrey who undertook the unsavory-assignment . We have never thought of the Vice President as merely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the contrary , we have always assumed that the Vice President agreed with the President 's policies , , including the decision to escalate the war ; his own statements over the last four years , deliVered with characteristic fervor , make his position quite clear . To assume otherwise would be to place a very low evaluation indeed on the Vice President 's courage , intelligence and integrity . Nor can we endorse the Nixon-Agnew ticket  --  not even as a protest , not even to offset the possibility that Wallace may tumble the election into the House . As we have said many times , while we regard Nixon as an intelligent , hardworking , astute politician , we also regard him as a man without settled principles , values or convictions  --  a view that finds striking confirmation in his egregiously irresponsible selection of Spiro T. Agnew for a running mate . If Nixon gets to the White House ( a prospect we do not relish ) , he will owe his election to the performance of the Johnson-Humphrey Administration , capped by the disgraceful spectacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say what we think about the Wallace-LeMay ticket . In deciding to make no endorsement , we have considered the possibility that the election may be thrown into the House , but we do not think this likely ( see article on page 425 of this issue ) . It has been urged that failure to endorse the HumphreyMuskie ticket will injure the chances of some excellent Democratic nominees , but in our view these nominees will fare better to the extent that they can separate their campaigns from the national ticket . Humphrey not only has no coattails to offer them ; he is trying to ride on Muskie 's We are impressed by the fact that many of the Congressional leaders of the Democratic Party who were for Humphrey before and during the Chicago convention are now unwilling to give his candidacy active support , although most of them would welcome the support of Senator McCarthy . If the Vice President had spoken out against what happened at Chicago , in the convention and on the streets , he might have , been able to restore a measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not rallied to his support . The fact is that the Johnson-MeanyDaley axis has done nothing to help these critics and is , in a variety of ways , conniving at their defeat . In Illinois , for example , the Democratic Senatorial nominee , William Clark , is. , not receiving the party support to which he is clearly entitled . It is said , also , that if the Democratic nominees for President and Vice President are defeated , the party will fall apart and the pieces will be picked up by the old guard . But the Democratic Party is not going to fall apart , and the forces of the " NeW Politics " have a good chance in 1972 to win the victory they did not win this year . Time is running out on such bosses as Barr , Tate and Daley , and on such , " labor leaders " as George Meany . Even though the All-Negro National Committee of InTHE NATION/ October 28 , 1968 419 quiry has voted not to endorse Humphrey ( he notified Rep. John Conyers on September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee , a broadly based group of Negro moderates and militants with 1,000 members in thirty-two states , to discuss issues of interest to Negroes ! ) , those Negroes who do vote , North and South , will probably be for Humphrey and Muskie . In many states the effect may well be to make Negroes the base of the Democratic Party , which this year has been deserted by so many of the elements that made up the New Deal coalition . Julian Bond , the Rev. Channing Phillips , Charles Evers , Aaron Henry and others are campaigning for the HumphreyMuskie ticket  --  not with an excess of enthusiasm but to preserve the position that Negroes have won in the party . It is reasonable to assume , therefore , that the party will be refashioned between now and 1972 through pressures operating from within , such as the New Democratic Coalition ( see article on page 427 ) and from without , such as the New Party , the Wallace adherents and the various new national constituencies It is said , finally , that citizens are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not like the proffered choices . But this ignores the fact that abstaining is a kind of vote  --  a vote of no confidence ( Wisconsin provides a place on the ballot to register such a protest ) ? and that under present circumstances it can be a very effecive way of using the franchise . Old coalitions are falling apart , new coalitions are trying to form . As long as the electorate dutifully lines up behind the candidates whom the Democratic and Republican Party professionals see fit to run , the professionals will continue to offer candidates whose chief virtue is that they defer to the professionals . But let it be seen that a significant segment of the public has emancipated itself from a fanciful duty to vote for someone  --  anyone  --  and is reserving its endorsement for a candidate it likes , then the parties will find such men . ( That they would not be hard to find was evidenced this year by the presence of Governor Rockefeller in Miami and Senator McCarthy in Chicago . ) A " lesser evil " is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country must seek is a greater good . Whereas reasons can be cited for voting for Nixon or voting for Humphrey , there are at least as good reasons this time around for passing : the country might get a new deck of cards . We hope nonetheless that there will be a large turn-out of voters on November 5 . The feeling of distaste expressed by many voters for the Presidential nominees gives . added importance to the contests in the Senate and House . Here is where voters sharing our point of view should invest their time , money and energy . Candidates endorsed by The Nation include the following : Senators Seeking Re-election .

' Columbia : Onus of Violence In the lull between police actions at Columbia last spring , members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Harvard University professor of law and former U.S. Assistant Solicitor General . The release of the Cox Commission Report in the form of a paperback volume entitled Crisis at Columbia ( Random House ) will help to correct some of the false impressions promulgated by the news media about Columbia 's campus insurrection . In the carefully measured cadences of a lawyer 's brief , the report redistributes the onus of the disturbances , hitherto heaped largely upon the students , to all the other participants : administration , trustees , faculty , police and community . The report definitively abolishes from respectable discourse the demonologistic theory that Columbia 's troubles began when Mark Rudd and a few others got past the Admissions Committee . It flatly rejects " the view that ascribes the April and May disturbances primarily to a conspiracy of student revolutionaries . " In this reassessment , it is impossible to avoid the implication , however much explicitly rejected by the commission , that Columbia University 's trustees and administrators were inept and intransigent in their handling of the issues and events . As adults and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's well-being , the members of an administration must hold themselves accountable to higher standards of truth , charity and efficiency than any other segment of the university . One can safely draw the conclusion that the students were correct when they insisted that the administration 's claim to authority was impaired by arbitrary and unresponsive attitudes and prac , ' tices . The iepori describes the administration 's " cold in difference , " its " resort to improvisation , " its analyses and 14 ' expectations which " proved utterly false , " and its willing , ness to match SDS ( Students for a Democratic Society ) in " mutual desire " . . . for . . . " further confrontation . " The report also dispels any doubts about the symbolic if not immediate seriousness and justice of the two principal demands of the strikers : abandonment of the racially embroiled gymnasium and severance of institutional ties with the war-embroiled Institute for Defense Analysis . The commissioners evidently share large areas of agreement with the dissident faculty and striking students ; yet they strongly condemn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buildings when ordered to do so by the administration under threat of forcible eviction by the police . Faculty who stood before the buildings and who thus encouraged ' the students are also severely condemned . The report attributes the large-scale injury and excessive violence  --  veritable police riots  --  ultimately to a per ? culiarly long list of imperfect arrangements and negative features associated with Columbia University : sub5 , , standard dormitories ; overcommitted and underpaid faculty ; unrepresentative trustees ; urban blight . The commissioners , whose exemplary commitment to the defense of liberal values and rule of law shines through on every page , might have pondered an alternative interpretation of Columbia as a university . It may very well turn out that the thousands of Columbia students who have now learned the art and acquired the courage of resisting illegitimate ' and corrupted authority will be needed in the darkening perspective of this country 's future in ways as yet unanticipated by fact-finding commissions . The reason why the unbearable tensions of the war in Vietnam , the breakdown in national political processes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere may not lie in any egregious defects of Columbia 's administration , campus or facilities . In the light of Chicago , it may rather be that Columbia 's faculty and stuff body stood closer to the realities of what it will take to prevent this country 's latent potential for fascism from k overwhelming the commissioners ' fine-honed sense of liberal proprieties . A keener sense of self-preservation , if not of charity , would have helped to improve this important document . Can we really condemn a college generation which is demonstrably better informed , socially and politically more involved , ethically more sensitive , and mentally and physically more courageous than the ' youth of any previous generation in. our history ? Are these not the qualities and capacities upon which the preservation of our democracy utimately depends ? MARYIN HARRIS The Legion vs .

Foster , the 69-year-old judge-advocate of the American Legion county organization . A " semi-retired " construction engineer , Foster had never heard of Marcuse until last May , when an antiMarcuse editorial appeared in a San Diego paper and was picked up by American Legion Post No. 6 . Almost overnight the post raised $20,000 to donate to the university to buy up Marcuse 's contract . The university declined the offer . " The Marcuse matter , " Foster says portentously , " was brought ' to my attention by certain officials of the community here whom I 'm not privileged to name , who hoped the Legion would move because otherwise there might be considerable trouble on the campus here . " The Legion 's role , it would appear , was that of protector of the university against Marcuse , who had been accused by papers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dissent is a serious offense in San Diego County , which counts among its chief sources of revenue defense plants , no less than twenty-one military bases , and retired military personnel . The Navy-Marine payroll alone dumps $1.2 million a day into the San Diego economy . For a while , however , Marcuse is likely to remain a thorn in the side of San Diego 's militant conservatives . The Universityx chancellor , Dr. Willivam McGill , does not favor dismissing profe'ssors at the behest of the Legion and the John Birch Society ; even if he did , he would find himself in difficulty with his own faculty and students , and a nucleus of liberals who read the Los Angeles Times in preference to the Copley papers . Two or three times a week , Dr. McGill goes around to civic clubs and similar groups , trying to convince them that Dr. Marcuse is only a man of ideas , after all , ' and not a menace to the government of the United States  --  or even of San , Diego County . Although he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely outcome is a prolonged deadlock . The university will not be the easy mark that show business was in the fifties . Brothers in Arms When soldiers are used against war protesters ? Chicago being a case in point  --  the demonstrating youth frequently chant " join us " to the GIs called in to break up their street and park assemblies . But one group of Regular Army soldiers who were in the Chicago call-up did n't need to hear the chant on Michigan Avenue and in Grant Park . Stationed at Fort Hood , Tex. , the forty-three black soldiers ( twenty-six of them veterans of Vietnam ) sat down in a parking lot and refused to budge when they learned that their new commander was to be Mayor Richard Daley . Said one : " We feel that we 've done enough for our country . We should n't have to go out there and do wrong to our own people . I ca n't see myself spraying tear gas on my fellow people . " . After vain pleadings by the soldiers ' division command-421 er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men give up their protest , the forty-three were arrested and led off to the Fort Hood stockade . " A lawful order must be obeyed , " said a Pentagon general . " It 's as simple as that . " But as Time observed , in one of the few published accounts of the Fort Hood soldiers ' strike : " It is not , of course , by any means as simple as that . " According to Time , " the Army may well be summoned into action in Negro ghettos in the future , and the generals are troubled by the possibility that black soldiers will find that they owe higher fealty to the black community than to the U.S. Army . " " The problem is so fearful , " said one officer , - " that we wo n't even discuss these people as Negroes . " The Army seems to be handling the forty-three as gingerly as court-martial justice allows . But perhaps the problem is even greater than the Army imagines .. It was evident  --  first in Grant Park and later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Hilton Hotel Incident , " The Nation , September 16 ) ? that the protesters for the most part got along fine . with the National Guard soldiers and that the latter seemed to feel little hostility toward the protesters . At one tense moment the Illinois National Guard was ' even cheered by the crowds when they replaced the brutal Chicago policeforce that had been surrounding the Hilton and attacking bystanders as well as members of the anti-war group . The protesters talked freely to the National Guard soldiers , even though the latter remained silent , under orders not to respond . But there were smiles from the soldiers , and individual protesters quipped that they looked like the guy next door and asked them what they were doing pointing bayonets at their ' neighbors . In this one-way conversation it was obvious that the young anti-war whites had their own ideas about soul brothers , and many of the soldiers rappeared.to be getting the message . Perhaps white soldiers will come to feel as did the forty-three black soldiers at Fort Hood and refuse to shove their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Daleys and the other leaders with fixations on a distorted idea of " law and order " turn for their shtick troops ? ' Newsroom ' Switches On During the San Francisco newspaper strike last year , the local educational television station , KQED , offered an hour of news each day as an emergency measure . When the strike ended , the program went off the air . Now , however , thanks to a $750,000 grant from the Ford Foundation , it is back , and better than ever . Mel Wax , KQED public affairs director , has assembled a group of skilled reporters who each weekday offer viewers Newsroom , an hour of intelligent , literate reporting and analysis . The Newsroom staff does such an excellent job of digging up and interpreting the news as to make the offerings of the commercial stations seem pale and monotonous . The program brings in a wide variety of guest commentators and also runs short films on various personalities and topics . This " opening up " of the hitherto mechanical , headline-reading format for disposing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the San Francisco area , and KQED 's innovations are now being imitated by several of the local commercial broadcasters . It is quite likely that the Newsroom coverage of the Walter Baskett shooting , in which an off-duty policeman killed a 28-year-old Negro , led to the reopening of the case and to a murder indictment against the police officer . The program has offered continued and detailed coverage- of this case , which is the biggest local story in San Francisco and one whose repercussions might possibly lead to the reorganization of the police department and the resignation of its chief , Thomas Cahill . Newsroom also keeps a sharp eye on other aspects of the San Francisco scene  --  race relations , education , entertainment , urban renewal , conservation , etc . The success of this undertaking suggests that vast potentialities in television  --  for news programs as well as other kinds of programs  --  have , yet to be realized .
