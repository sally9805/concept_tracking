 | How New Methods and Changing Attitudes are Affecting the Battle over Birth Control For years , population experts have been warning of a doom threatening mankind ? a worldwide " population explosion " likely to prove as disastrous to the human race as nuclear war itself . Throughout most of recorded history , the experts explain , the race between births and deaths has been nip and tuck . Disease and starvation carried off men , women and , especially , children almost as fast as new babies could be born to replace them . Some tribes lost the race altogether and became extinct . During the great plagues and epidemics , the world 's population actually decreased . In other years it increased very slowly . Then , with the appearance of modern science and public health , death rates dropped to a fraction of their former level . As a result , the world 's population broke out of bounds . John D. Rockefeller III , in 1963 , dramatically described the effect : " It took mankind the whole period of recorded time until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion . It took only a century to add the second billion . It took somewhat over 30 years to raise the world population to three billion . And , at the present rate of increase , only fifteen years will be required to bring the figure to four billion . Worst of all , almost nothing was being done to curb this pell-mell slide toward a " standing room only " disaster . . But now changes are beginning to occur . Today , for the first time , population experts are beginning to feel some hope that the battle to save mankind from crowding itself to death may yet be won . The years 1964 and 1965 , they report , may prove to be the turning point . Here are the grounds for their optimism . Progress in the U.S. Here in the United States , overpopulation never seemed an immediate threat . We had vast areas waiting for the plow , granaries bursting with food , cities eager to grow , industries ready to expand their production . Moreover , as our c  | death rate gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons . Newly-married couples could see for themselves , just by looking around them , that families of moderate size generally prospered while large families frequently suffered crushing handicaps . Mothers of limited families were not worn out at 40 by excessive childbearing and child-rearing . Each child got more attention , and a better start in life . Seeing this , more and more couples chose to limit their families to the number of children they could care for adequately ? and many of them found readily available the various means and methods to achieve this limitation . The result was a dramatic example of how mankind can adjust itself to the changing needs of a changing environment . A new family pattern was established , based on two or three children instead of six or eight . The threat of overpopulation in the United States , it appeared , was diminishing . But sociologists , welfare workers , ministers and others concerned with social affairs gradually came to realize that the problem had not really been solved ; it had only been swept under the carpet . For , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there remained a large underprivileged section of the population , right here in the United States , who were as cut off from modern methods of family limitation as the most isolated peasants in rural Pakistan or Haiti . Some of these families had never even heard of birth control . Many others knew about it , and desperately wanted to limit their families ? but did n't know where to go , what to do , or how to pay for birth-control service . The medical needs of these families were cared for by welfare departments and publichealth clinics , which provided free maternity services and hospital deliveries and well-baby clinics ? but offered no help whatever when it came to family limitation . Yet these were precisely the families , of course , who were least capable of raising large numbers of children adequately . Now , at last , the United States seems on the verge of reaching this hard core of the problem . In community after community , public agencies are beginning to include birth control among the health and welfare services available to the underprivileged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement to make birth-control services available to all American families met with fear of opposition from the Roman Catholic Church . That church , it was widely believed , opposed family planning . Hence , legislators , welfare administrators and hospital authorities ? even those who believed in birth control ? refused to make it available in public institutions or under public auspices for fear of " the Catholic vote . " Today all this is changing . A responsible spokesman for the liberal Catholic 52 position , the Reverend John A. O'Brien , Research Professor of Theology at the University of Notre Dame , has stated bluntly : " Instead of Catholics being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as so many non-Catholics imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed . Family planning is encouraged , so that parents will be better able to provide for their offspring . " Similarly , Father William J. Gibbons , S.J. , of Fordham University , has declared that the size of the family " should take into account the physical and mental health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which they live . " Father John L. Thomas , S. J. , of St. Louis University , has said : " Granted present nuptiality rates , age at marriage , and advances in health care , no country can long make reasonable provision for its population increase unless a good percentage of its couples take some effective steps to regulate family size . " Recently , four of the largest Catholic dioceses in the country have established " Family Planning Information Centers " to instruct couples in the " morally acceptable use of the rhythm system " of birth control . Catholics continue , of course , to oppose methods of birth control they deem " artificial " or , more precisely , contrary to the natural law . But , in community after community , it has recently become possible to work out compromises on terms acceptable to both Catholic and non-Catholic groups . New York City , which is 47 percent Catholic and which has long had a Catholic mayor , is one outstanding example . As recently as 1958 , none of New York 's municipally-owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of patients , or referred their patients to such services . Then Dr. Louis Hellman , director of obstetrics and gynecology at one of these city hospitals , asked the permission of his hospital 's board of directors to do so . The board , including its two Catholic members , gave him the goahead . On the morning of July 16 , 1958 , the first patient was scheduled to receive the new service . She was a young woman with diabetes who already had had three children ; another pregnancy would threaten her life . Half an hour before her appointment with Dr. Hellman , the city 's Commissioner of Hospitals ? a non-Catholic ? interfered . He ordered Dr. Hellman not to treat th , patient . Now the fat was in the fire . Thy Protestant Council of New York spoke out strongly against the commissioners stand . So did leading Jewish spokesmen . Ministers and rabbis preached sermons attacking it . New York 's foremost newspapers carried editorials supporting the right of patients , including city-hospital patients , to medical birthcontrol service . City officials at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " blow over soon . " But it did n't blow over ; the issue of the diabetic mother deprived of the service she needed held the attention of the whole city week after week . And even Catholic voices were raised to question the wisdom of fighting on such an issue Thus Monsignor J. D. Conway , while referring to the hospital ban on birth control as " admirable , " declared that " little permanent good will be accomplished and much harm done " by fighting to retain the ban . The Catholic weekly Commonweal noted that " other citizens can not expect Catholics to change their beliefs or their practices . . . but neither can Catholics expect to control the beliefs and practices of others . " Mayor Robert F. Wagner indicated that he was n't going to be the stumbling block . " As a practicing Catholic , " he declared , " I am opposed to contraception . That 's my own opinion . I emphasize again that I will not interfere with the decisions of the Board of Hospitals and the commissioner . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment . " On September 17 , just two months after the original incident , the Board of Hospitals withdrew its ban . In 1963 , a second issue arose in New York City : Should city welfare workers refer welfare recipients to the newlyestablished birth-control clinics ? By now both Catholic and Protestant leaders were eager to avoid a fight . In the interim , a great deal of discussion of the problem had taken place , including an influential article* in Goon HouseKEEPING by Dr. John Rock , a prominent Catholic physician . And this time there was no fight . Early in 1964 , City Welfare Commissioner James R. Dumpson , himself a Catholic , issued instructions to his staff authorizing birth-control referrals for welfare recipients . Compromises making birth-control services available through public agencies and at public cost on terms acceptable to both Catholic and non-Catholic groups have similarly been worked out in Baltimore , Dallas , Denver , Washington , D.C. , and several other cities . States like California , Florida and North and South Carolina have moved in the same direction . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds to make birth-control services available to residents of the District of Columbia . The details of the compromises vary , but the broad outlines are similar . First . it is agreed that no one should be " pressured " to adopt birth-control measures against his or her will . Thus the New York regulations specify that birth-control information and supplies shall be provided only to patients " who wish to avail themselves of such health services . " It is also generally agreed that when birth-control information and materials are made available under public auspices , the method acceptable to Cathalics ? that is , the rhythm method ? hould be among those offered . Patients should be allowed to choose among nethods for themselves . Finally , it is agreed that no Catholic n a public position should be required o violate his conscience by participatng in a birth-control program he does tot approve . Thus the New York City tospital regulations specify : " Physicians , nurses and other hospital personel who have religious or moral obections should be excused from participation in contraceptive procedures . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of population experts s the recent development of new nethods of birth control , The pill " is , of course , the best mown . By taking one " birth-control " till daily for 20 days in each menstrual cycle , a woman can effectively prevent conception . About two million American wives are successfully using this nethod today . But other methods are n various stages of research and development . One is a pill to be taken by husbands ather than wives . Another is a pill which need not be taken every day but only the morning after . A third is a pill to be taken once a month , and a fourth is a vaccine which might protect against unwanted pregnancy for several months on end . None of these rear methods is yet ready for general use but research on them all is progressing . Yet another new method , already generally available , is a " vaginal foam " which requires no physical examination or doctor 's prescription . Though somewhat less effective than " the pi : : ' or mechanical methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who find other methods objectionable . Vaginal foams are being nationally advertised , and in most states are sold over the counter in drugstores One serious shortcoming of all birthcontrol methods now in use is that they are wide open to " patient failure " Husband or wife must do something to make the method work . Human nature is fallible , and even the best method will fail if husband or wife forgets to follow instructions . The most remarkable of the new birth-control methods eliminates this kind of " patient failure " altogether . It is a small plastic or stainless-steel device which can be readily inserted into the uterus by a physician , and then left in place for years . Neither wife nor husband need do anything more until they are ready to have their next baby . Then the wife returns to her physician to have the device removed . ( This method is not 100 percent effective . It is possible for a woman 's body to expel the device without her knowledge ; and cases have been known when a woman became pregnant even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these occurrences are extremely rare : the method is rated very effective . ) In vast nationwide field trials , these devices are now being tried out h thousands of American women under the auspices of more than 30 leading @#  | medical centers and planned-parenthood clinics . Similar studies are going on in Chile , India , Korea , Pakistan nd other countries . When produced in large quantity , the plastic inserts should cost only a few cents each . Catholics and the rhythm method . While Catholic authorities have always apposed " artificial " methods of birth ontrol , they have long accepted the rhythm method , which depends on calculating the time of the release of an ) vum , or egg , by one of the wife 's ovaries , and then refraining from sex elations during the days preceding and ollowing . Its shortcoming is the impossibility of predicting accurately the day m which an ovum will be released . In : 951 , Pope Pius XII himself expressed he hope that science would eventually lace the rhythm method on a " sufciently secure basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals and o research centers suggests that Pope Pius 's hope may soon be realized . For several days before an ovum is eleased , physiologists have learned , subtle hormone changes take place in woman 's body . Thus the way is open develop a test which will detect these changes and hence signal the aproach of ovulation several days in advance . If a simple , economical test of is kind can be developed , the rhythm : ethod may become one of the safest all birth-control methods ? a long ep forward for non-Catholics as well s for Catholics . Research is also under way on methis which would trigger the release of o ovum on a specified day . This , too , would make the rhythm method more reliable . Outstanding Catholic scientists like r . Rock have expressed confidence . at research will also develop other entirely new means of family limitation which will prove both highly reliable and acceptable to the Catholic conience . Veed for more research . But population experts have long been discouraged the paltry sums available for such search . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nited States Government , through the tional Institutes of Health and other encies , has been spending nearly a : lion dollars a year on cancer and art research and other medical studies nut only a pittance on populationntrol research . A few years ago , it seemed likely that this issue , too , might ad to an open clash between Cathos and non-Catholics . But once again Protestant and Catholic leaders spoke out together Episal Bishop James A. Pike , for example , called on the government to launch more research in this area , and Father O'Brien of Notre Dame de:nded that " the National Institutes of alth be authorized to conduct a crash gram on human reproduction in all its phases . " was America 's first Catholic President , significantly , who changed American policy on this point . Not long bePandora i Gee whiz , what makes a girls ?

That Catholic and Protestant laymen agree , to a considerable extent , about birth control is shown in a recent public-opinion poll which asked this question : " Right now , Catholics are forbidden by the Church from using artificial birth-control devices . Would you like to see the Catholic Church decide to allow Catholics to use birth-control devices ( contraceptives ) or would you oppose that ? " Here are the answers among the public generally and among Catholics intervi-ewed : Total Public Catholics % % could allow 52 49 ) t allow 15 32 ) t sure 33 19 Results to date . The first effects of ese and other changes are already coming apparent . Following World ar II , the U.S. was experiencing a population explosion of its own . For n years in a row , more than 4,000,000 babies were born annually ? balanced only 1,000,000 deaths a year . Then e downswing began . The birth rate 11 from a peak of 124 babies per 1,000 omen of child-bearing age in May 57 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some experts are erecting that this year , for the first time ace 1950 , the American baby crop ay fall below 4,000,000 . Progress in other countries . The fall the U.S. death rate began more than century ago , and continued to drop adually . Thus we have had several generations in which to adjust our birth to to our death rate . But today 's underdeveloped countries do not have . at much time . Control of killing seases has been introduced in these countries quite suddenly , so that poputions are skyrocketing . On the island Mauritius , in the Indian Ocean , the death rate fell from 36 to 14 per thoudad in five years . On the island of aiwan ( Republic of China ) the death tte is down to 8 per thousand ? but the ' birth rate is still 37 per thousand . Thus the danger arises that such countries , ready overpopulated in terms of their limited resources , may double their populations again within a single generation . No one doubts that birth rates in these countries will eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catastrophe ? The answer , it now appears , is " May- Japan is one dramatic example of access . In 1950 , her birth rate was very high and her resources limited . hen methods of family limitation ' ere made freely available . Married couples responded with alacrity . Withi a single decade , the birth rate was at in half . Japan , however , is a highly-industrialized country . To date , no underdeveloped country has had similar re-sults , Need for U.S. aid . Underdeveloped countries , with the help of U.S. foreign aid , have had success in rapidly lowering their death rates ? especially their infant death rates . They have hail moderate success in raising their productivity , also with U.S. aid . But the additional food , shelter and clothing - produced do not necessarily improve the standard of living . On the contrary . in some countries production increases are barely sufficient to supply the increasing population . Hence it has appeared , even to the most fervent supporters of U.S. foreign-aid programs . that our money is being poured down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most miserable subsistence for rapidly-ballooning populations . Yet , as a matter of national policy . the U.S. , in the past , refused to help other countries with this most urgent of all their problems ? even countries like India and Egypt , which were eagerly seeking such aid . Once again it was President Kennedy who retailored American policy . The United States , it was announced in 1963 , would thereafter " help other countries , upon request , find potential sources of information and assistance on ways and means of dealing with population problems . " Role of the United Nations . Changes also have been occurring on another front . The United Nations , in addition to its efforts to keep the peace , is concerned in many quieter ways with the economic and medical progress of the underdeveloped nations . But the U.N . aid programs , like those of the U.S. were long plagued by the fact that population growth was outstripping agricultural and industrial progress in many parts of the world . And with so many Catholic countries represented in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be free to help on this front . But just as Catholics and non-Catholics inside the United States have been slowly forging a compromise on birth control acceptable to both parties , so progress toward agreement is being made among nations . The United Nations General Assembly , by a vote of 69 to 0 , resolved to study the relationships between population growth and economic development and to seek solutions to the problem . Thus , help may soon be available from the U.N . as well as the U.S. The threat , of course , is still with as . No one is so blind as to believe that the problems engendered by the population explosion have already been solved -- but the future no longer looks hopeless . For experience has shown that men of good will , sitting down together to consider what needs to be done , can , with the aid of scientific research , solve the population problem as they have solved so many other problems throughout mankind 's history .               @ @ @ @ @ @
