txt Western America is searching for new and equitable sources for water ; it must also determine where future water needs will be greatest . Last of nine articles exploring these crucial water-policy choices . Notions about canals on Mars were never as intricate as the reality of California 's vast State Water Project . It 's 80 percent completed . It 's partly operational . For more than a year now , its keystone feature , the world 's highest earth dam located at Oroville-700 feet high and made of 78 million cubic yards of earth and rock ? has been storing water . Engineering problems solved in building this state-long system of canals , tunnels , pump lifts , and the like , will doubtless show the way for years for other big-scale water schemes . If not for Mars , at least for western North America and arid parts of Africa and Asia . - California leads nation California calls it the largest single water project in the world to be financed all at once . A single appropriation paid for all but certain incidental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the water delivery business almost from the beginning of state history in 1850 . The state 's mining companies , mutual water companies , municipalities , irrigation , and reclamation districts have , it is widely agreed , led the nation in developing water transportation systems . Together they have accumulated immense water know-how . // *California nears water goal // They have devised a huge body of water law . They had to . In this state the water needed for agriculture , industrial enterprise , and city growth always has been availableL-but somewhere else . Soon after the turn of the century , both San Francisco and Los Angeles began going to far-off mountain areas for added water supplies . Southern California later : took the initiative for developing the Colorado River as a major water source . Today California has some 4,000 separate organizations and agencies dealing , in one way or another , with water . It was n't until after World War II that - the State of California itself concluded it had to go into the water business . : People , water separated Eighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas  --  Sacramento , .. San Francisco , Los Angeles , San Diego . But 70 percent of the state 's water supply originates in rivers north of San Francisco . Rome built aqueducts and tunnels throughout Italy , Spain , and Gaul , including one that still keeps the Trevi Fountain flowing . These were engineering marvels , but they served relatively small distances and populations who were modest water users compared to Californians . Wasted water put to work It takes 400 barrels of water to process just 1 barrel of crude oil in Los Angeles . It takes 100,000 gallons to cool 1 ton of steel . It takes the California householder ? or any ' American householder , in fact-150 gallons Of water daily just for his own share of - what is required for washing , cooking , drink.ing , plumbing , and heating . - Meanwhile water was wasting from Cali:iornia 's upstate rivers  --  the Feather , the Sacramento , the Eel , and others  --  into the Pacific in acre-feet by the millions . An acre-foot of water is equal to 325,900 gallons ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the depth of one foot . To store and deliver this wasted water downstate was , as it still is , the purpose of the State Water Project . The voters of California approved the project in 1960 by voting in favor of a bill known as the Burns-Porter Act . This authorized the issuance of $1.75 billion in general obligation bonds . It is to this move by the voters that the State Department of Water Resources refers when it speaks of the project as " financed at one time . " . Some qualifications arise from the fact that now the state will probably have to increase its interest on the bonds if it is to attract buyers for them all . It has had to defer certain project facilities until it can figure out how to finance them . It has reduced the scope of others . It has made some cost cuts by improving its procedures . Even so , say state officials , there will probably have to be another bond issue some day . Population growth by 1990 , the state reckons , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water  --  from an augmented Colorado flow , from desalinization , and so on  --  will not by then have been accepted . Meanwhile , the state is getting revenue from power generated by power plants developed in connection with Oroville Dam . And water districts throughout the state have contracted for enough water to pay for the project 's cost . Its annual delivery capacity will be 4,230,000 acre-feet . To supply them , the completed project will operate almost 700 miles of aqueducts . The Romans built complex structures , but nothing like these . The tunnels are as big as two-lane highway tunnels . The open canals , some like great rivers , are concrete lined . The system includes two nuclear reactors to run the electric pumps that lift water 2,000 feet over the state-dividing Tehachapi Mountains . Water concept changes Already water is serving parts of the San Joaquin Valley scarcely 100 miles north of Los Angeles . In the early 1970 's , water will reach the region dominated by Los Angeles that extends south another 100 miles to Mexico . It looks now as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an acre-foot . Colorado River water imported into the area sells for approximately $37 . Water districts will blend the two figures into some kind of realistic rate , depending on the market . More and more the old concept of water as a free right is giving way to the view that it is a purchasable commodity . Western water specialists say the time will come when people will have to be much more conscious than they are , even today , that they pay for every drop they use . If water development for the coming century follows the pattern cut out by California ? the transport of water over long distances , over mountains , and through deserts ? engineers will undoubtedly study numerous problems solved here . California had to figure out how to lift water over record heights and then keep it from flowing down hill too fast . It also had to fmd a way to move it across the biggest earthquake fault in North America , which the canal cuts across in the Tehachapi Mountains . To solve this , the engineers simply de- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building tunnels . Just building Oroville Dam required de . veloping enough new techniques for earth movng to set precedents for years . Today 's exploratory talks about eventu. ally linking the California water system with the Pacific Northwest 's mighty Columbia River call for even more venturesome engi. neering . The United States Bureau of Recla ? mation is researching , for instance , the possibility of using a plastic tube under the ocean , along the continental shelf . Canada and Alaska report Spokesmen for western Canada and foi Alaska considered in detail the needs they foresaw for using all the water in their areas . At the same time they indicated that eventually they might have surpluses they would be glad to export . It may be prophetic that the State of California has completed contracts for the purchase and transmission of electric power from both the Bonneville Power Administra. tion and Canada . The first deliveries of Pacific Northwest power were made to Cali fornia 's new pumping plants on April 1 , 1968.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
