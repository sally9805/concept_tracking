p ublic apathy  --  and official resistance  --  had stymied our attempt to expose Sen. Tom Dodd 's misuse of office for personal gain . Now , as we tried to figure out some way of overcoming these obstacles , I recalled some of Dodd 's aborted investigations , of which I had learned ) while still on Dodd 's staff ) from Carl Perian , staff director of Dodd 's Juvenile Delinquency Subcommittee . One such investigation  --  of the illegal traffic in lethal fireworks  --  had been called off by the senator after three representatives of the industry called on Dodd . Later . they told Perian , they returned to give the senator a contribution . But this was only one of several cases . No single activity gained more publicity for Senator Dodd during his first term than his probe into the unremitting portrayal of violence and depravity on television . And for a time none of his ventures seemed to hold out such promise of public benefit . Psychologists told the Juvenile Delinquency Subcommittee that prolonged exposure to television " action " shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brutality . A new generation had grown up in front of the television set . From 1961 on , Dodd 's Juvenile Delinquency Subcommittee staff gathered impressive information proving that this kind of programming had come to dominate the prime viewing hours on the three major networks . The staff was prepared to show that the steady diet of crime . sex and violence had been 4.111 II , Idesignee. for the American public by a solidi eit ; up of top vision executives in ordui to jack up ratings and advertising income . I learings began , the television tiii kguls were summoned and t heir records subpoenaed . Apprehension mounted among the network top brass . Resigna-tions were accepted from programming executives , plans for new " action " shows were hastily abandoned . and promises of improved fare were piously made . Then in July , 1961 , the subcommittee received information that clearly identified President Robert Kintner of the National Broadcasting Company as the personal architect of the violence craze on NBC-TV , and subcommittee aides industriously prepared for hearings that would expose to public view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the shabby considerations that dictated the type of programs saturating the home screen and the minds of its millions of young viewers . The NBC empire drew protectively around Kintner . According to the Juvenile Delinquency Subcommittee counsel , Paul Laskin , a subcommittee subpoena for NBC documents was evaded , and company officials committed perjury in an attempt to shield Kintner from personal responsibility for the network 's programming practices . A former NBC vice president , David Levy . contradicted other company officials by singling out Kintner as the driving force behind NBC programs of crime , sex and violence . A crucial point in the subcommittee investigation was thus at hand . The staff pressed for a showdown with its mighty adversary , and for a resolution of the conflicts in sworn testimony . But then Dodd began to back off . Ile rejected all pleas to carry forward the NBC probe , and he abused chief counsel Laskin savagely in the presence of NBC officials for " persecuting " NBC . He eventually fired Laskin for " disloyalty . " When a second subcommittee counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South Dakota University Law School ) , presented a legal argument for pursuing the NBC investigation that was almost identical with Laskin 's , Dodd locked it away and never acted upon it . Dodd shut down the investigation , and forbade publication of the crucial executive-session testimony . He rejected one staff report after another on the investigation . and finally specifically forbade any mention of the Kintner-Levy conflict . On his orders . the watered-down report he finally approved was shown to NBC officials for their clearance before it was distributed to the other senators on the subcommittee . NBC Vice President Peter Kenney reported back that , while his company conceded the report was " fair " to NBC . it would , of course , prefer no report at all . Dodd obligingly never made the report official . Some staff members bitterly deplored Dodd 's decision as a sellout . But we had to accept the fact that , for some reason , he was determined not to proceed against Kintner . Still , we hoped that the general investigation into television practices was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revived . In both 1963 and 1961 Dodd requested and received subcommittee budgets of about $200,000 ? with completion of the television probe as his stated main objective . Perian mapped out a set of hearings . His proposals called for a new look at the three major networks . plus a probe into smaller groups of independent broadcasters . One afternoon Carl invited me to a private showing of a special film the subcommittee staff had spliced together from segments of a dozen top-rated programs . The opening scene concerned a Western gunslinger who liked to shoot people " right between the eyes . " Another featured a prolonged and sadistic beating of a young man with heavy chains by a mob of hoodlums . There was a torture sequence in which the victim 's lips were seared off with a blowtorch . Then came the in- evitable fistfights. the stabbings. maimings , sniper killings and mass murders that make up the nightly entertainment of the American public , with its 25 million young viewers . When it was over 1 was almost sick to my stomach . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after night , year after year , will do to people  --  especially all those millions who are unbalanced to start with ? " Carl asked . " The scenes we just saw were from shows produced by the three major networks . They were all condemned by the committee at the last hearings , and the networks apologized for them and said they 'd do better . Instead , they 've put all this garbage in syndication for reruns . A new network , Metromedia , bought the worst of it . It 's as if they used our 1961 hearings as a shopping list . Metromedia stations are now showing almost as much crime and violence as the three major networks put together . And they 're showing these programs earlier in the evening , 10 an audience made up largely of children . " Tables were prepared for Dodd comparing the Metromedia channels and the other broadcasters . Subpoenas were drawn up for Metromedia officials and their files . But Dodd refused to issue them . " It would n't be fair to single out this one independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We figured that this might be a stall , but the staff dutifully ran another survey  --  on Storer Broadcasting , Westinghouse and other independents . Carl told Dodd , " We have no real basis for investigating the others . They devote less than thirty percent of prime time to shows that feature violence . For the big networks the figure is fifty percent . For Metromedia it 's eighty percent ! " But the answer from Dodd was still " no . " Carl followed him over to the Senate floor to make a last appeal . " If we let Metromedia get away with this , after all our brave pronouncements , it will make a mockery of our whole investigation , " he told the senator . " I told you before . Carl . I 'm not investigating Metromedia . " Dodd said . " That 's final . " " Even if they 're the worst ? " " Everything is relative . Carl . I do n't want to hear another word about it . " Dodd turned away . He remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During Dodd 's first probe into television in 1961 Carl had asked Metromedia to send him several of its Iihns for monitoring . That warning signal had touched off an intensive wooing of Dodd by Metromedia executives . First came a series of invitations to social events from Mrs. Florence Lowe . an attractive widow , appropriately titled " Coordinator of Special Projects . " As the months passed , the Dodds were wined and dined ever more frequently by the tireless Mrs. Lowe . Then Metromedia President John Kluge took a hand He began to entertain the senator , even had the Dodd family to his Beverly Hills home , recently purchased from Frank Sinatra . Kluge 's attentions gave the Dodds a new social prominence . In the summer of 1965 they were hontmed at a lavish party at Kluge 's estate nt Vit - g4114a , 10 which Cabinet mumhers , senators , a Supreme Court Justice , and Washington columnists and celebrities were transt tried on a special bus . Ann the gifts poured in a television set from Mrs. Lois e. imported champagnes from Kluge. testi- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were other financial contributions from friends of the Kluges and of Florence Lowe . For instance , in October , 1964 . Mrs. Lowe steered millionaire Mortimer Gordon to Dodd . " I think that the two of you will become good friends , and I know Morty will be your ardent and meaningful supporter , " she wrote . At their first meeting " Morty " had a $1,000 contribution ( or his newly found friend . There was never a format probe of Metromedia . To this day no bona fide committee report on the four-year television probe has ever been issued . Other investigations followed the same pattern . In 1961 Senator Dodd requested and received the vacant chairmanship of a special unit within the Antitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee . This unit had a number of tasks , one of which was to investigate abuses within the insurance industry by which the public could be defrauded . Dodd held this responsibility at a time of increasing criticism of insurance practices from ordinary policyholders , from students of the industry , and finally from members of Congress . Letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained that their insurance costs were unconscionably high , that they had been hoodwinked by fast-talking insurance men , that their automobile and hospitalization policies , maintained for years at great sacrifice , had been peremptorily canceled without just cause , that their benefits had been diluted by the line print . Insurance lobbyists had answers to all these charges  --  and others  --  and they deserved to be heard . But the need for a full-fledged Senate investigation into the little-known insurance world could scarcely be disputed . The very existence of Dodd 's subcommittee presupposed such a probe ; the volume and gravity of the complaints demanded it . There was , however , to be no general investigation of the insurance industry , Instead , to the industry 's great relief , Dodd con ducted two trivial inquiries , one into the practices of foreign insurers that competed with American firms , the other into fly-by-night companies that were irritants to the great established corporations . In 1964 , moreover , Dodd actually diverted his staff to the task of finding ways in which he could be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " were held in his office with groups of insurance officials , and plans were made for such projects as turning over to private insurers the government insurance on grain in Commodity Credit storehouses . There were complaints about Dodd 's inactivity , but it was not until we saw the documents that I found out how profitable the goodwill of the insurance companies was for Dodd . Our records , which probably told only a part of the story , showed that Dodd received more than $24,000 in testimonial gifts , honorariums , fees and favors from sources within the insurance industry after he became responsible for investigating it . Some $4.000 of the sum came in the form of testimonial gifts from insurance executives and salespeople . Another $4,500 came in fees for pro-insurance speeches . And $6,000 came as " finder fees " for helping a real . estate speculator , Manlio Liccione , obtain loans totaling a million dollars from two insurance companies . When Drew Pearson broke a story on this incident , indignant spokesmen for the companies rushed forward to deny that Dodd had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Liccione gave the game away . Contacted by the Hartford Times at a Florida resort , he confirmed that Dodd had been his go-between with the companies ' executives . " Tom did nothing wrong . and I was very happy to let him earn some extra money , " said Liccione . And from the time Dodd began " investigating " insurance abuses , he stopped paying his own insurance bills . By 1965 these unpaid premiums amounted to $3,500 . But the Charles McDonough Agency of Hartford did n't bother to collect . There were no nasty ultimatums or cancellations . Dodd had solved the " lapsed-policy " problem for himself , if for no one else . Far into the night we planned together the next phase of our campaign  --  Drew Pearson and we four former members of Dodd 's staff . Marjorie Carpenter . Terry Golden , Mike O'Hare and I. The Pearson columns would resume regularly , we agreed , and other newsmen would be invited to share our material . And there was more . " I have friends in the Senate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I 'm going to talk to them . I think it 's time we had some speeches urging a public investigation . " We drove homeward in a state of high excitement . " I do n't see how they can avoid public hearings , " cried Oregon 's Sen. Wayne Morse a few days later . The long Senate silence on the Dodd case was broken . It was April 13 , 1966 . He was incredulous , Morse declared , over an Associated Press story which said that the Senate Committee on Standards and Conduct : the Ethics Committee ) was to shut down the Dodd investigation quickly , without public hearings , and quietly draw up a report behind closed doors . " The record ought to be made public . " exploded Morse . " The . American people are entitled to it . because it has become public business . " Morse turned to press reports that the committee and the Justice Department were devoting primary attention to uncovering how we had furnished the Dodd documents to the press , instead of evaluating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the facts are , but I know the press and the people are going to continue to ask the controlling question : What about the contents of the documents ? Are they true or false ? I do not think 1 need to tell anybody in this body my feelings alsiiit stool pigoons nr hettavers trust , huh those quest its me a televant to the question of tete , miming 11111110110 ' ur , cauli ! " Morse then s lidded the Ifixq ol sera l , . ; aaplien Voting of Ohio . a small tail fiery septuagenarian , who each ? aatt made public a complete record of his income and assets , " It has seemed ... that the committee 's proceedings have been shrouded in a cloak of secrecy , " Young began . " I feel it would be in the best interests of the Senate and of the nation if the committee were to conduct open hearings on the subject without delay . Certainly , were a Senate committee to be investigating similar charges against any high official in the Executive Branch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter would be fully aired before the American public . Have we the moral right to create a double standard of conduct . one for the Executive Branch and another for the Legislative ? " The Ethics Committee could not continue mute when senators began voicing misgivings . Prompt assurances were given by chairman John Stennis of ' Mississippi that the committee would be thorough and unhurried . Vice Chairman Wallace Bennett . a Utah Republican , a past president of the National Association of Manufacturers , and an elder of the Mormon Church , went further . " The Senate itself is on trial , " lie said . Though noncommittal about public hearings , he promised that the complete record of committee actions would eventually be made public . On the day after the speeches by Morse and Young , the Pearson columns resumed , as promised . The opening column related how $47,000 raised by Dodd in a series of political events on October 26 , 1963 , had been diverted to Dodd 's personal use , without the payment of income taxes . Added to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100.000. apparently a magic figure to the press . This time we could feel the impact immediately . Pearson 's disclosures caught the attention of Richard Harwood , a feature writer for the Washington Post , who now asked for an interview with Dodd . A few weeks before . Harwood had done an article friendly to the senator . so Harwood was rewarded with an interview . It was not with Dodd , to be sure . but with David Martin , who was now the senator 's chief assistant . Dodd 's plan , we later learned , was to use Harwood to launch a trial balloon in answer toPearson 's charges , This disaster .

Testimonial dinners enable a law man to remain in office . They are part of the American way of life . ' ' Predictably . the " American way of life " was seized upon by cartoonists and pundits far and wide . For the first time Dodd 's affairs began to receive widespread press attention . Prompt and alarmed challenges to Dodd 's version rolled in  --  from the White House all the way down to the Connecticut precincts . President Johnson , asked about his attendance at two of Dodd 's " tax-free testimonials , " said that he had never attended a dinner that he knew was being held " for anyone to obtain funds for personal use . " Sen. Clifford Case said that even if Dodd could establish that the money was really intended for him , his conduct was improper . The receiving or giving of contributions . apart from campaign purposes , Case said . was " thoroughly bad public policy . " Sen. John Williams described Dodd 's contention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all the political money he had diverted to personal use . Four members of the Ethics Committee told the Washington Star that Dodd 's contention was new to them . and Senator Bennett said , " I have never been a party to that good old American tradition . " For a year I had wondered what Senator Dodd 's explanation of the missing treasure would be when we finally confronted him . The ploy of the tax-free gift must have been conceived in fear of the Internal Revenue Service . But it seemed tome that in the long run this explanation would raise as many legal problems as it solved . A large percentage of the testimonial donations came from people who had efficial business with Dodd as a senator . Taking money from people whom he had officially aided was questionable enough , even when the contributions were politica/ . But at least this had the sanction of common usage . To accept these contributions as personal gifts , however , was bound to raise black questions about vote-buying. influence-peddling , conflicts of interest , violation of state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the standard SiOla or io offer . ing from Washington lobbyists to the from the International Latex Corp . The universally adverse reaction jolted the senator . Though within three months he would offer exactly the same explanation , with rhetorical embellishments as to the prevalence of $100,000 appreciation tributes rcommon as nutmegs in Connecticut , common as raindrops " ) , Dodd now branded Martin 's statement as completely an . authorized , and returned to his former policy of silently hiding behind the Ethics Committee . At this point , chairman Stennis decided to call Marjorie , Michael , Terry and me in secret session before a special subcommittee , composed only of himself and vice chairman Bennett . Though not well known to the public . John Stennis enjoyed a considerable reputation for astuteness among his colleagues . He had once been a judge , and he carried about him an air of the courtroom . But it was not for these qualities that Stennis was chosen , above 99 colleagues , to he chairman of the committee to investigate other senators . It was also because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of senators , a natural oligarch instinctively hostile to outside intrusions into the privacy of the Club . " Remember this , " said Drew Pearson 's associate , Jack Anderson , " Stennis may not have any use for Dodd , but he loves the Senate . And if he can help it , he 's not going to let the Senate be dragged through the mud . He may decide to sacrifice Dodd for the good of the Club , or he may decide to cover up for Dodd for the same reason " On the afternoon of April 1966 . Marjorie , Terry . Michael and I were brought before Stennis and Bennett , one by one . The questioning focused on three subjects : Dodd 's fund-raising ventures , his relationship with Julius Klein. and airline travel for which Dodd might have improperly billed the Senate . Six days later Stennis announced that the Ethics Committee would conduct public hearings " on matters relating to the alleged relationship of Sen. Thomas J. Dodd and Julius Klein , owner of a Chicago public-relations firm . " The announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vindication of a year and a half of effort . But not to Jack Anderson . He was more worldly-wise . " Why did they pick the Klein case ? " he asked . " We used it first in the column . because we wanted to start off with the small stuff and work up . They may he setting the stage for a whitewash . " Weeks passed without word of when the hearings would be held or of how wide would be their eventual scope . Talk of the Dodd case died out , as reporters waited for a lead from the committee . Into this vacuum moved the senator and his attorneys . On May 6 , Dodd . with great fanfare . filed the live-million-dollar , 14-count libel suit against Pearson and Anderson that he had long planned . It charged an illegal conspiracy between the columnists and the es-employees who had burglarized his files . I assumed that the libel suit was a multipurpose ploy , intended to stop the Pearson columns . frighten the " es-employees , " give Dodd a public-relations boost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of Dodd 's affairs was known to us and hence to the Ethics Committee . But if Dodd and John Sonnett. his chief attorney , were engaging in psychological warfare . they must have been dis-appointed with the results . There was no break in the ranks of the prospective witnesses against Dodd . Pearson and Anderson continued to pour it on in their column and showed their determination to light the libel suit to a successful verdict . In a key decision they won a court order permitting interrogation of the senator in the pretrial deposi-tions . Suddenly Dodd backed away from the suit he had launched with such publicity . He dropped 10 of his original t4 counts and began to ask for oos11 ) . nunicnts . In December . 1967. he the libel suit entirely . Early in June the Ethics 0 ) 1111161rue minaunceil that the laald-Klein hear-11 las would begin ini the ' , : 2nd of the ninth . The details of these hearings were incredible and confusing , and ould soon fade away . But the insight into Dodd 's character that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and skeptical senators , would not be so easily forgotten . As he talked of the treacheries committed against him , he forgot his stage manners . He leaned forward . His eyes seemed to glitter . His hands clenched and unclenched . He spoke repeatedly of " the Soviet terror apparatus , " intimating that if he had n't been fighting it , he would n't be under investigation . But it was n't just the Communists who were out to get him . While he had been campaigning in Connecticut in October , 1964. he said , everyone in the state knew that his closest associates were traitors . " I was surrounded by people who were betraying me , and nobody ever told me about it until the campaign was over , " he said . Before the hearings were finished , he was convinced that the committee , too , was betraying him . During the testimony of a witness friendly to Dodd , a faint pounding could be heard , caused by workmen down the hall . The disturbance was so minor that Stennis , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halt the testimony . But Dodd stormed to his feet and precipitated this bizarre exchange : Donn : Ca n't we have that hammering stopped ? STENNIS : We are trying to have it stopped . If it disturbs you DODD : I ca n't hear the witness with the hammering . I hope it is not prearranged . BENNETT : I object to the statement that it is prearranged . Donn : I do n't say it was prearranged . I said I hoped it was not prearranged . STENNIS : Let 's not make an issue out of that , Senator Dodd . DODD : I just do n't think we ought to have hammering going on while this important witness is testifying . SONNETT ( trying to gel Dodd to sit down I : Let me take a fresh start at it . STENNIS : Wait just a minute . Senator Dodd says he can not hear . DODD up again ) : I ca n't hear with that hammering , and I do n't think anyone else can . STENNIS ( aghast ) : All right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Short recess ) No one could tell exactly when the blow had landed that had so decisively damaged Dodd , but it had happened . He had about him the telltale look of guilt , the scent of humiliating defeat . When the gavel came down for the last time , the press stridently demanded to know when hearings into the more serious charges against Dodd would begin . Senators agreed that the Dodd investigation could not end at this point without touching off a nationwide cry of " whitewash " and " cover-up , " which would be far more damaging to the collective image of the Senate than the revelation of one senator 's misdeeds could ever he . For months chairman Stennis said noi hing ive . Nniverdict was issued on I he Klein ease . Then , in Noveinher. 1966 , Stennis amp lanced that new public hearings wutdrl Is lick !

" 1 needed the money , This has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay off one , and in order to do so I had to borrow from another . I ca n't remember beyond that ... I got in the hole in 1956 , and I was never able to get out , and some of these things had to be paid off . I used what money I had to do some of it . and then I would be behind , and I would have to get help from somewhere else . . . and that is the best I can tell you . That is really all I know about it . " The words came haltingly , as Senator Dodd testified in his own defense at the fifth and final session of the Ethics Committee 's public hearings into his " political and official finances . " It was , ironically enough , St. Patrick 's Day , 1967 . Dodd 's appearance had changed markedly since the Klein hearings . His once celebrated white mane was now lusterless , and there was a gauntness in his lined face that emphasized its high cheekbones and Roman nose His eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toneless . He had the look of a noble but ghostly old Indian chief , totally unable to comprehend the meaning of captivity . F rom Stennis 's viewpoint the hearings must have seemed a triumph of precision and control . Whereas the McCarthy hearings in 1954 and the Baker hearings in 1964 had dragged on rancorously for weeks . the Dodd hearings were winding up on their fifth day , exactly on schedule , after a pace so fast that the press had been able to digest only a fraction of all that had been revealed . For Stennis the golden mean had been achieved . Enough misconduct had been laid out to discredit Dodd and set the stage for some discipline that would pacify the press and public . But enough had been concealed to spare the Senate 's honor and avoid an exposure of the deep-seated abuses that command tenacious , if covert , support on Capitol Hill . The Klein hearings had apparently been an experiment  --  a dry run in which Stennis and the committee tested the witnesses , the Dodd defense , the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those hearings had taught Stennis. among other things , that if order was to prevail , if a belligerent self-defense by the senator was to be avoided , Dodd must be indicted out of his own mouth and tried by the Senate on the basis of facts conceded by his own lawyers . Dodd thrashed . fumed . struggled , resisted and fought Stennis at every turn , hurling one legal challenge after another at the committee . It heard each one , and rejected them all . " Senator Dodd is receiving the benefit of every right known to American jurisprudence , and some that are not known , " Stennis said . The committee staff was ready for hearings in September , 1966 , but Dodd was not yet prepared to submit . So Stennis delayed , until November , until January . until March lways tightening his net , qu ietly cow wiling private negotiations Over aim ; of " stipulations , " by which would admit the basic facts of 11 ) e charges against him , while leaving open t he question of intent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that public hearings would begin on March 13 . Dodd was told that if he would not sign the stipulations , the committee was prepared to prove its claims , point by point , over the course of several weeks . Dodd must have realized that an hour-by-hour public revelation of his complicated machinations would destroy his reputation once and for all . Finally , on March 11. he surrendered . John Son ? net signed his name to 116 statements of fact . The long wait had achieved its objective , Dodd . no longer struggling , had been gathered in . In those 116 statements of admitted fact , and in the tables and bank statements and reports that accompanied them , Dodd conceded the accuracy of the committee 's case . He admitted having raised , at seven fund-raising affairs . at least $203,000 that had never been publicly acknowledged or reported . Most of the $203.000. the stipulations revealed . was spent for nonpolitical purposes  --  home renovations. personal air travel for himself and his family , club dues , limousine service to a racetrack , household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the hearings ended , Marjorie , Michael , Terry and I met to evaluate what had happened . The abrupt termination of the case , with so much left unexplored , mystified and dismayed us . It seemed to us that the privilege of secrecy which protected both a senator and the Senate from exposure could not be in the public interest . We decided to make a formal appeal to the committee to reopen the investigation . I drew up a 2.000-word letter that cited 24 cases in six broad areas that the bearings had neglected . The letter was signed by all four of us , and a copy was sent to each member of the Ethics Committee . A week passed without answer or acknowledgment from any of the six senators . I then made contact with the Washington Post . to determine whether the letter was newsworthy . Two hours later Managing Editor Ben Bradlee gave the order to remake the front page and to print the complete text of the letter and a story on its contents . The following morning , the 100 senators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any others who were interested could read , with their morning coffee , what we had told chairman Stennis and the committee . The first response from the Ethics Committee to the Post 's publication of our letter came from vice chairman Wallace Bennett . Our allegations , he said . were being considered by the committee and might have a bearing on its recommendations . But Stennis remained adamant , and in the end his formula for a limited inquiry prevailed . In the ensuing weeks committee spokesmen offered a variety of reasons for the restrictive policy . Stennis assured senators that no attempt would be made to prove or even to suggest that Dodd had violated any law . That , lie said , was not the Senate 's function . Sen. Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota . a member of the committee . elaborated : " We did not raise any dui ? HI. ; which we thought involved i ? law . either the Internal Reveniaor the Corrupt Practices Act , or any other law that might he brought to bear on this case . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to existing law , but when the committee reached the point where we thought we were impinging on existing law , we refrained from going into the question of illegality with reference to any actions attributed to the senator from Connecticut , " Thus , the committee had adopted the curious position that when a violation of ethics turned out to be so serious as to constitute a violation of law , the Senate must cease to pursue it . McCarthy also explained why other large areas of Dodd 's conduct were not to be considered  --  such matters as the " finder fees " Dodd received for obtaining commercial loans for would-be borrowers . Since no specific rule on this matter had been established by the Senate . McCarthy said . the committee did not want to single out Dodd . The ethical morass in which the Senate as a body was submerged was starkly revealed here . Any Cabinet member or ordinary bureaucrat would be automatically dismissed in disgrace for engaging in the practice . But what was outlawed in the Executive Branch was not even to be investigated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a United States senator . By the last week in April the Ethics Committee had reached a unanimous verdict . Manfully , Stennis decided that Dodd should be the first to know , and that he . as chairman . should tell him . On the morning of April 27 , 1967 , Stennis went to Dodd 's suite , funereal in dress and solemn in manner , the committee report in his hand . He was led immediately into Dodd 's private office , where the senator waited with his wife , Grace . Stennis shook hands with Dodd and bowed to the senator 's wife . " I have the report , Tom , " he said softly . " It 's not all good . " Indeed it was not all good . As Stennis reported to the full Senate a few minutes later , it condemned Dodd for converting to personal use " at least $116 , - 083 " that was raised ostensibly for political purposes , and for obtaining on seven different occasions identical reimbursements for travel expenses from both the Senate and private organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess , or I 'm not half the lawyer I think I am . " With those words . Russell Billiu Long , the Senate 's No. 2 Democrat , volunteered himself as Senator Dodd 's floor defender against the Ethics Committee 's censure charges . " Why , this man has n't done anyhi ! , it has n't been done before by ter senators , ' ' Long said . " Half the members of the Senate Ethics Committee could n't have survived the investigation given to Torn Dodd 's affairs , ' ' On reflection , he broadened h is indictment : " Half of the Senate could n't have survived such an investigation ! " " Members of the Senate . . " There was a melancholy note in the rich Southern voice . Ninety senators , perched gravely behind their diminutive , antique desks , looked toward Sen. John Stennis , standing erect and stolid , a sheaf of papers before him . " We are not prosecutors . We have not been . It is our duty , however , to present this matter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a senator was under way . For two hours Stennis , plainly and without embellishment , cited facts and figures . Then he concluded : " If we pass up this matter , then sometime , somewhere , in some way , something big will slip out of this chamber , and a lesser standard or lesser rule or lesser conduct will have to be accepted . Sad as it is and I say it is sad for every one of us , for the senator from Connecticut and for the rest of us  --  I do not believe we can afford to do it . " The Concaving day , when Senator Dodd rose to present his long-awaited defense , he looked well . The Senate floor was inherently more to Dodd 's liking as a battleground than the witness chair . Here there was an honored place for dramatics , for acting , for performance Oratory had always been his forte , and he well knew that in oratory facts do n't really count . Not only was he no longer under oath , he was constitutionally immune from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat him with their customary deference . It would be his word against the word of those who were absent . His posture was properly humble hewas a beleaguered man , seeking only to save his honor . His voice was finely tuned . He knew this was the most important performance of his life . " Is there anyone the asked , who has not felt in some  --  perhaps fleeting moment of anguish that goodness has suddenly fled the world ? That all of the canons of justice have been repealed ? That the minimum requirements of human decency have been suspended ? A moment , I mean , when without deserving it , you come under general attack ; when you know the attack is unjust , yet others deny or doubt what you know ? " Any senator sitting there on the floor could be betrayed by his staff into such a predicament , Dodd suggested , and . as the Senate listened in rapt attention , he insisted that his apparent transgressions were actually the work of distortions , half-truths and lies by his former aides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . no dismissed employees had sought to do what Boyd and Carpenter had done . " Dramatically he raised his right hand . " I swear now , and I will swear forever , I am telling you the truth . If I had to face my Maker in a minute , I 'm telling you the truth , and may the vengeance of God strike me dead if I 'm doing otherwise ! " Dodd looked around the chamber , his gaze pausing on the face ot first one senator , then another . " I have walked among you . I have talked with you . I have lived with you for more than eight years . Does any one of you know that I have ever lied to you ? That have done any dishonorable thing , ever broken my word , ever cheated you , ever said I would do this and then done something else ? Is there anyone here who says I lied ? Get up ! If I lied  --  get up and say so ! " He looked across the chamber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is at stake . I would rather be dead than dishonored . " For three hours he held his judges spellbound . Then he concluded : " I do not ask for mercy . I ask for justice . " As he made his way off the floor . senators grasped his hand warmly . On the third day general debate began . One by one , the members of the committee  --  Senators Bennett , Pearson , Monroney , Cooper and McCarthy  --  defended in detail particular aspects of the charge that chairman Stennis had laid down in broad outline . Stennis himself was , throughout , the commanding , if sometimes distant , figure . There was surprising sentiment for Dodd . Great waves of emotion would surge from the Dodd camp and wash across the floor , only to dash ineffectually against the clifflike Mississippian and recede . As the week progressed . Dodd , now without a script and perhaps encouraged by the disposition of other senators not to question him closely , descended further and further into evasion and distot lion , then to demonstrable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and retrained from humiliating him . But it is in the nature of debate , however circumscribed , that s , saier or later someone will ( Lace a confrontation with I he truth . It happened when freshman Sen. Charles Percy of Illinois rose to speak . Percy addressed himself to the key question of Docici 's insistence that he personally bad never misled anyone into believing that any of the testimonial dinners were for campaign purposes , though his friends might mistakenly have done so . Percy had a letter in his hand , taken from The Neu ' York Times of May 28. 1967 . It had purportedly been written in 1963 by Dodd himself to Vice President Lyndon Johnson just before a series of Dodd Day testimonial affairs . Silence settled over the Senate as Percy began to read : Dear Lyndon , First of all allow me to thank you again for your generous offer to come to Connecticut to assist me in my forthcoming campaign . ' Author 's italics . ... " Percy asked Senator Dodd if he had , in fact , written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Dodd snapped back . blanching . A crisis point had been reached in the debate . one from which Dodd 's fortunes never recovered . Only something spectacular could turn the tide now , Russell Long told his confidants . Long had thrown himself wholeheartedly into Dodd 's defense . He had harassed , without stint. the various presentations of Ethics Committee members . He had tied the Senate in procedural knots to delay the hour of reckoning . Each day he had come to battle equipped with co.orful charts and graphs which he c aimed would prove that Dodd . far f-urn profiting out of campaign funds , was actually deep in the red . Adroitly Long juggled figures which , when challenged , he admitted he could not authenticate at the moment . " I am the only man who understands Tom Dodd 's finances , " he said . Irrepressibly he pointed again and again to a chart covered with figures which demonstrated , he said , that Dodd was blameless and had profited " not one red copper cent " ? until Stennis forced Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , " just imagination " and " not in the realm of reality . " Now , with Dodd 's case apparently all but lost , Long tried to mount one last major oration . He paced up and down the aisles , waving his arms . He cited every authority from Jesus to his old Uncle Earl . Dodd was an " honorable , high-type. lovable man . " Boyd was a " rotten apple in the barrel . . . a corrupt , immoral , deceitful scoundrel . " Drew Pearson was a " crocodile . " Screaming at the top of his voice , Long denounced Michael O'Hare with maniacal fury : " That crook , that thief . that liar , that scoundrel , that bandit  --  if you can think of another crime , let 's put that in there too ! That murderer ! He is trying to murder a man 's political career ! " Senators and newsmen alike were incredulous as the Assistant Majority Leader of the United States Senate wandered ranting through the Senate aisles . The evidence against Dodd was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) wants us to eat that fruit . " he hollowed , " Well , I ' in just not going to eat it . " For seven hours , as hope for a final vote that day fair led and disappeared , Asia ; rambled on . Si onietimes he seemed to have lost touch with reality . I ) odd covered his eyes when his defender lapsed into his old bayou stories . The Connecticut senator had by now begun to crumble visibly . " How many times do you want to hang me ? " he shouted . " You want to do it ? Do it done with mei Do away with me ! " The parliamentary machine ground slowly toward a vote . " Have I used the testimonials to enrich myself or live lavishly ? " Dodd cried out . It was June 21. the seventh day of debate . " I do n't think the public wants my head ! " he shouted . His face was scarlet ; his clenched fists flailed the air . " What the people want is a clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a single senator .... It is shameful that I have to go through all this ! " His voice broke , and in a whisper he said . " I hope it never happens to any one of you , what has happened to me . " June 22 : " I do n't understand all of this . I do n't know whether you 're trying to build a gallows or a courtroom . " June 23 : " Whatever fate befalls me . I am satisfied that history will justify me . You know me well enough to let your consciences be your guide . " W ith a crushing force the votes came at last . Long 's motion to soften the censure was defeated 92 to 2 . Only Long and Abe Ribicoff of Connecticut stood with Dodd . As voting began on the censure resolution itself , Senator Mansfield took Dodd 's arm and escorted him out to the Marble Room , just off the Senate floor . When the vote was finished , but before it was announced , an emissary went to Dodd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peers had voted to condemn him . only four had voted " nay " ? Long , Ribicoff . Thurmond of South Carolina and Tower of Texas . Dodd 's eyes filled with tears . Later he addressed the Senate : " I think a grave mistake has been made .... In my heart I have no feeling of wrongdoing . If 1 did , I do not think I would show up here again . But only time can tell that . " As tears crept down his cheeks , he was again led off the floor . In the days before the trouble came , Tom Dodd was fond of an old Al Smith quote that he used often in his speeches : " I know the difference between right and wrong , " he would say . " If I ever do wrong you must hold me accountable , for you will know that it was intentional , " But lately he had taken to a new motto : " There ought to be a rule regulation , or law so a man knows whether he is doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he kept insisting , to the standards he had encountered along the path to high office . My first reaction was to think of him as a hypocrite . Yet , underneath his delusions and self-pity , there was , I had to concede , a trace of honest bafflement at the chain of events that had brought him down . I began again to look on Tom Dodd with , I think , some of the understanding and sympathy I once had for him . So much of his early career had been aihairahle : his work against crime : his kprojects to help i mod werished youths ; his unheralded tight for civil rights when it was an unknown cause ; his role at Nuremberg , where , amid the ashes of Nazi depravity. he had represented , not unworthily , the principles of justice , decency and international law . In his early years in politics he had often rejected expediency. defied the party bosses and battled for idealistic goals . Here was a man with a capacity and an instinct for high public service who seemed destined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only an empty or venal man , his story would be unimportant . It is what he might have become , had the system through which he rose encouraged his strengths instead of his weaknesses , that gives to his fall an element of tragedy and a claim to significance . When Tom Dodd turned to politics in Connecticut , he entered a world in which public office was generally expected to be an avenue to private enrichment . State legislators held high-salaried sinecures in the state administration to assure their support of the governor 's programs . Well-placed politicians made fortunes in connection with highway contracts , real-estate purchases , legal practice before state commissions . and other enterprises connected with government . Dodd observed that such customs were making wealthy men out of some of his political contemporaries , so he began to learn . The technique of the $100-a-plate dinner Dodd learned from the state 's Democratic chairman , John M. Bailey , who held one , sometimes two , every year . The proceeds were supposed to go for the legitimate expenses of running the party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money raised was never announced , nor was any public accounting of its use given or expected . Of course . Connecticut had a law governing campaign contributions , but there was never an official check into such reports . The inevitable result was that Dodd and other politicians came to regard the matter of political money as their own business and no one else 's . When Dodd entered the House of Representatives in the early 1950 's , he found that its ethical climate was merely an extension of what he had left behind in Connecticut . Covert trimming was a congressional institution . protected by a network of secrecy . Congress had decreed , for instance , that the public must not be told who was on a congressman 's staff , or what congressmen did with their government allowance for office supplies , or how much of the taxpayers ' money a congressman spent while junketing in Paris or Rome or Rio . So more than 100 congressmen quietly placed their wives and other relatives on their office payrolls ; many members regularly pocketed large portions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each session , the body departed more or less en masse for the world 's pleasure spots to conduct investigations . Recurring scandals and spectacles eventually forced a reluctant Congress to lift somewhat its veil of secrecy , but most avenues to petty profiteering remained open . Deceit was also formalized in other , more dangerous , ways . There was the " teller vote , " a method of voting on public measures that permitted the individual congressman to conceal his stance from his constituents . If , after a teller vote , a record vote on the same issue was demanded , 40 to 60 congressmen sometimes switched sides , often reversing the outcome of the original ballot . One might think that such studied cynicism at the heart of the legislative process would he a matter of shame to the Congress . But these vote reversals occurred year after year and were regarded merely as occasions for cloakroom jests . Dodd rose higher , to the Senate of the United States , and one by one he discovered its authorized duplicities . A senator who is vacationing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invariably listed in the Congressional Record as " present " on quorum calls or " absent on official business . " The Congressional Record , assumed by historians and judges to be an accurate transcript of debate , a record on which treatises and judicial decisions are based , is actually in part a work of fiction . Each evening , after the Senate adjourns. the Official Reporter 's office is crowded with senators and aides busily rewriting the day 's discussions . It is not just the bad grammar that is reworked . The substance is often changed , even reversed . Whole paragraphs are deleted , entire pages are added , and the Record is transformed from an account of what was , to a scenario of what its participants would like it to seem . Small matters ? Perhaps . But the small things as well as the large set the moral tone of an institution . With deceit in voting , in debating . in payrolls. in expense allowances enshrined by custom and protected by secrecy . it is a small step to graver abuses . Dodd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was even more calculatedly dissembling than the Connecticut statute . A senator could collect a million dollars and report only $10,000. with no questions asked . Such a law . and its cynical nonenforcement , was an open invitation to fraud . In the 40 years of the law 's existence , during which some 16 , - 000 reports had been filed . not a single violation had ever been reported to the Justice Department by either the Senate or the House . The Bobby Baker case showed how easily it could be done . When the Senate Finance Committee seemed on the verge of adopting a tax amendment that was highly unfavorable to certain savings-and-loan associations , the adversely affected businesses promptly promised Baker $100,000 to spread among influential senators . The offering amendment was withdrawn soon thereafter . When , during the Baker probe , a finger of guilt was pointed at Sen. Robert Kerr and others , had not the chairman of the investigating committee . Sen. Everett Jordan . declared , " We are not investigating senators " ? Dodd could expect that it would always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform in the Congress defeated by overwhelming margins . " A senator is the judge of his own conduct . " Sen. Everett Dirksen would say and his colleagues would nod approvingly . And so the Senate appeared to Dodd not as a harsh and exacting judge , but as a permissive and protective accomplice . His occasional inanities in debate would always appear in the Record as words of wisdom . His absences would be reported as presences . His vacation trips would not only be paid for by the Senate but would be billed as " official huinies , " I lie honoraria and limier ! , . e ; ; and gifts were excused Irian the lirollibitions that covered all governuent officials men ( congressmen and senators . I-hs fraudulent campaign reports would always he accepted at face value . He could use his official allowances to buy birthday presents . wedding invitations and the like , and no one would know . He had reason to consider himself immune from investieation - above the law . And there was the need for money , ior the symbols of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end . After all the struggle and all the sacrifices . there had to he a commensurate reward . But the monetary rewards of government service are modest . To the man whose very livelihood is tied to the caucus and the ballot box , politics is a fearsome gamble . In each new campaign he mortgages everything ; society risks nothing . If he loses any of the recurring tests of strength , he may be finished , bankrupt and forgot. ? ten . In American politics there is no place for the loser . The child of wealth can play at the game of politics without staking his total existence on it . He is spared the meaner considerations that constantly beset his poorer counterpart . For Dodd , as for many another there was in defeat no family estate to retire to . no inherited fortune to give solace . And so Tom Dodd , hardened by the indignities of politics , disillusioned by its shabbiness , alienated by its brutality and its indifference to his survival , his fears , his needs . at some point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service does not in itself bestow . The ethical standards he had encountered along the way had fed his weaknesses , not his strengths . and , compromise by compromise . he had fallen . " There is no victory here for anyone , and no victory against anyone , " proclaimed John Stennis , after the overwhelming vote for censure . " I feel that the adoption of this resolution , in a way . is a new start for the Senate . " And he promised that the committee would begin work on a code of ethics . Certainly the Dodd case had shown some of the reforms that were needed : an absolute ban on any form of outside income for members of Congress that bears a relation to public issues or public business ; annual disclosure of all income and assets by members of Congress ; public financing of election campaigns . with strict reporting laws and the prohibition of large private contributions ; removal of the loopholes from the conllict-of-interest and bribery stag utes ; tight controls on lobbyists , including itemized reporting of all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Congress shields its internal operations from the public . If present salaries and expense allowances are inadequate , Congress should increase them so that the costs of public office are paid openly . But did the Senate really want " a new start , " as Stennis suggested ? Or would it wait confidently , as in times past , for the restoration of public indifference ? The answer would depend , in the end , on the unrelenting insistence of the American people that the temple must be cleansed . The light was all over . The Senate chamber was at last silent . Tom Dodd could assess the extent of his ruin . His colleagues had censured him , but he was still a senator , with undiminished seniority . He still presided over Senate investigations into crime and delinquency . He remained a member in good standing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at a time of deepening national division over the Vietnam war . In his fortress on the Senate Judiciary Committee he continued to pass upon the qualilications of judicial nominees and to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice  --  which was meanwhile supposed to he investigating him . The White House needed his vote more than ever , now that a congressional revolt against the President 's program was underway And so , in his hour of public disgrace , Tom Dodd announced that henceforth he would carry on in the Senate as if nothing had happened . that he would run for a third term in 1970. and that he was confident of being re-elected . In a sense it would be the people of Connecticut who decided his ultimate fate . And in this circumstance he saw a glimmer of hope . There had always been something almost mystical about his faith in his ability to explain things to the folks at home . He was , above all else , a campaigner . He would get back there on the old circuit , in the church basements and lodge halls and on the picnic grounds , out where he could talk to people . There they would see it all differently .
