One of the world 's rarest furs is the North Pacific sea otter , for the simple reason that except for an occasional poacher 's pelt , none has been available for more than half a century . Lustrous dark brown and noted for their durability and warmth , sea-otter skins were prized by Russian czars even above sable . Chinese mandarins heaped huge rewards on Siberian seamen daring enough to cross the Bering Strait and trap sea otters in the Aleutians . But two centuries of intensive hunting brought the near extinction of the species . By 1912 , when Russia , Canada and Japan joined the U.S. in prohibiting further trapping , scarcely 500 sea otters remained . <P> Now , sea otter is coming back on the market . Under protection the herds have multiplied to a present population of some 40,000-enough so that Alaska has begun harvesting a strictly controlled number of pelts . Last week more than 100 buyers representing the world 's top fur houses converged on the Seattle Fur Exchange to compete for Alaska 's initial harvest . In less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who revived the trade as a state-owned enterprise , presided over the sale of 826 skins . The record-breaking top price : $2,300 per skin , paid by George Liebes of Dallas ' Neiman-Marcus for four male pelts , each more than 5 ft. long and 30 in. wide . <P> Liebes had come with carte blanche from Stanley Marcus to buy the finest four skins to be made into " the most extravagant lady 's sport coat in the world , price no object . " What might the coat cost ? " Oh , maybe $20,000 , " said Liebes . Adds Alexander Ehrlich of Manhattan 's Bergdorf Goodman , who was commissioned by Alaska to produce a sample , full-length cape to stimulate interest , went on to buy 30 pelts : " With all the couturiers looking for something new , this is the ideal time to introduce this fur . Now it 's up to the women . " And perhaps to the men as well . Ed Shepherd , in charge of Alaska 's sea-otter trade , recalls that the fur was once lavished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at all surprised to see knee-length sport coats of sea otter for men .
