How soon can a live-virus poliomyelitis vaccine , taken by mouth , supplement or replace the Salk-type , killed-virus vaccine , which must be injected ? Not until many tricky questions about safety and effectiveness have been answered , the U.S. Public Health Service has ruled . Last week the National Foundation , which supported Dr. Jonas E. Salk 's work with marching dimes , announced grants totaling $300,000 to speed answers to key questions about the live-virus vaccine prepared ( also with help from foundation funds ) by Cincinnati 's Dr. Albert Sabin . Recipients : <P> Yale University ( $81,308 ) , for Dr. John R. Paul to study the extent to which attenuated ( weakened ) strains of virus , used in the vaccine , may revert to viru lent types during multiplication in the subject 's digestive tract . Specifically , what is the best dosage to give protection , and do bigger doses carry greater risk of in creasing virulence ? <P> Baylor University ( $170,884 ) , for Dr. Joseph L. Melnick ( formerly on Dr. Paul 's Yale staff ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 250 of them to receive the vaccine . Here , too , signs of reversion to virulence will be sought ; also , evidence of how much protection accrues to contacts who " catch " the live virus from vaccinated subjects without being vaccinated themselves . <P> Western Reserve University ( $57,387 ) , in Cleveland , for Dr. Frederick C. Robbins to find out how the vaccine will work if fed to newborn infants . Question is whether polio antibodies , inherited from the mother and conferring " passive immunity " for a few months , will interfere with the child 's developing its own antibodies for lasting " active immunity . " <P> Not covered by the National Foundation grants are two other U.S. - made oral vaccines . One , prepared by Dr. Herald R. Cox for Lederle Laboratories , is being tested by the University of Minnesota . The other , from Dr. Hilary Koprowski of Philadelphia 's Wistar Institute , is also being tried at a number of institutions . Both , like the Sabin vaccine , have been given to millions of people outside the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
