Brittle good intentions glare out from the bright pages of this year 's children 's books , but most are sad failures , lacking equally in anything resembling either joy or pain . Publishers are like elderly relatives who come to visit-they coo , they tweak too many cheeks . Worse than relatives , they also play up to parents by dropping names , and they charge high prices to do it : this year 's list includes several books for very small children that cost upwards of $3 , putting an unnaturally high price on a child 's natural impulse for destruction . <P> A Is for Awful . Among the books most bragged about are the most notable flops . Jean Stafford 's Elephi is repellingly saccharine , worse even than Lesley Frost 's ( the poet 's daughter ) Really Not Really , in which life ( really ) and fantasy ( not really ) are carefully trussed into sweet little packages . Poets Ogden Nash and Phyllis McGinley , both of whom are capable of better things , have written companion books ( Girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and awful . <P> The bulk of the season 's books appear to have been written in an afternoon , then printed early next morning . There are countless books filled with topical trivia , like Countdown for Cindy , the story of a blushing girl astronaut . There are stacks of books so eerily old-fashioned that their manuscripts must have been found in somebody 's attic , like Susan Peck , Late of Boston . And there are mountains of dull and dutiful books dedicated to teaching children everything from fishing to fission . Mostly , there are far too many books whose size and gaudy color will no doubt divert the uncertain shopper 's eye from the enduring children 's classics . But among the 1,600 children 's books published in the U.S. last year are a few that are the best in years : <P> NUTSHELL LIBRARY , by Maurice Sendak ( Harper &; Row ; $2.95 ) , is a box of four delights , tiny enough for a child to hide away and keep . All the stories are both written and illustrated by Sendak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of them has a function : one teaches counting , another the alphabet , a third offers a strong moral ( you should care ) , and the fourth praises the wonders of chicken soup with rice . <P> THE MEANEST SQUIRREL I EVER MET , by Gene Zion , illustrated by Margaret Bloy Graham ( Scribners ; $3 ) , is a shy warning that there are mean squirrels in the forest too . Hero Squirrel has all his nuts stolen by M. O. ( for Mean Old ) Squirrel , who tries to sell them at the Squirrel Cafe , but is politely scolded , reforms and , in the end , teaches the little squirrels how to play ice hockey with a hazel nut . <P> LITTLE OWL , by Reiner Zimnik , illustrated by Hanne Axmann ( Atheneum ; $3.50 ) , is a translation from German of a tale about a peeping-owl . The illustrations convey with charm and mystery a mocking view of the foolish fears that isolate adults from the pleasant world of children and small animals . <P> SLEEP BOOK , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is his best in years . Its illustrations are properly outlandish , and its verses are zany and catchy enough for many rereadings . It is to be read to a child in bed in the hope of encouraging him to join the rest of the animal kingdom in slumber ; so : <P> Everywhere , creatures have <P> shut off their voices . <P> They 've all gone to bed in the <P> beds of their choices . <P> They 're sleeping in bushes .
