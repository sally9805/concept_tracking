The cloud-capped towers and echoing canyons of Manhattan have long been a beacon for immigrants , a bonanza for photographers and a familiar profile to its citizens . But in the past five years , new towers have reared skyward , old landmarks have disappeared , and vistas have opened with such suddenness that a returning native would scarcely know the place . Manhattan is in the midst of a building boom that in volume , value and variety is unmatched in the history of the human race . Even oldtime Manhattanites have been startled into a sharp awareness of their city 's dramatic angularity and inexhaustible enterprise as they peer at it from their new tower offices , or come upon an open plaza where once there was only a narrow sidewalk . <P> This sudden architectural flowering is only an outward manifestation of the spirit of the world 's richest and most incredible city-a clangorous concatenation of wealth and squalor , the crowded island that is a center of culture and a hotbed of crime , a place where everything is for sale , and anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasure ranges from apartment houses to bus terminals , from office buildings to slum-clearance projects ( see color pages ) . <P> Culture Complex . This week with John D. Rockefeller III on the stage , Leonard Bernstein on the podium , Jacqueline Kennedy in the audience , and a nationwide TV audience looking on . Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts made its debut with the opening of the $15.4 million Philharmonic Hall . It is still surrounded by a pocked and chugging wasteland of bulldozers and derricks , power shovels and cement mixers , which will eventually be a 14-acre landscaped park containing a repertory theater , a theater for dance and operetta , a library-museum , a building to house the Juilliard School of music , and ( by 1965 ) the new $35 million Metropolitan Opera House . When completed in 1966 , Lincoln Center will be a $142 million complex , and the most important cultural center in the U.S. <P> Ten blocks to the south , there was a different kind of opening with its own brand of superlative : the tallest hotel in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of crescent on Seventh Avenue between 52nd and 53rd streets . Like its rival , the 46-story still-unfinished New York Hilton a block away , the Americana will help remedy Manhattan 's constant shortage of public rooms by supplying them in all sizes and shapes . There are 41 of them in all , seating a total of 11,290 diners ( the seven kitchens occupy nearly an acre and contain such housewifely nightmares as dishwashers capable of sterilizing 15,000 pieces of glass or crockery an hour and potato-peelers that can skin 75 potatoes a minute ) . Very Important People may be whisked upstairs in a private automobile elevator without setting foot on sidewalk . <P> 30-Story Insects . The bill for this vast renovation job dwarfs some small nations ' total budgets . In 1961 the total value of private construction prospects in the city 's five boroughs , not including public works or utilities , amounted to $1,184,100,000 . Part of the 1961 boom is attributable to the rush to get under the wire before the new zoning regulations* went into effect .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
