" It is laborious , but we advance , " was the word sent to Charles de Gaulle last week by his top negotiator , Louis Joxe , Minister for Algerian Affairs . In a secret meeting place near the Swiss border , Joxe 's French delegation and that of the Moslem F.L.N. , headed by Foreign Minister Belkacem Krim , were in the " final stage " of drawing up the cease-fire agreement that will end the seven-year Algerian war . There have been reports of an impending truce for months , but this time it seemed so close that one of the few remaining points at issue reportedly was De Gaulle 's insistence that he himself be allowed to announce the accord . <P> Agreement has been hammered out on a dozen points , among them : <P> &gt; Both sides agree to a referendum to take place in Algeria , with a yes or no vote on the question , " Do you approve of Algerian independence and cooperation with France ? " <P> &gt; France gives up its claim to the Algerian naval base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settles for a 30-to 40-year lease . <P> &gt; All Europeans in Algeria automatically become citizens for the first five years of independence , but may then opt for French citizenship . Those Europeans who wish to retain French citizenship from the start will be treated as " privileged " foreigners , with property guarantees and their own schools , but they must remain politically inactive . <P> &gt; F.L.N. promises wide amnesty to all Moslems who served in the French administration or armed forces . <P> &gt; F.L.N. agrees not to publish a white paper on French atrocities or to stage any " Nurnberg Trial " of Frenchmen , either in person or in absentia . <P> &gt; France agrees to Algerian sovereignty over the Sahara , provided that French oil interests are respected . <P> &gt; The cease-fire will be immediately followed by the setting up of a " Provisional Executive " with the specific job of handing over the government to the F.L.N. as soon as possible . <P> &gt; The task of policing the cease-fire will gradually be turned over by the French-army in Algeria to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20% French troops . <P> Slow Death . As peace appeared ever closer , the S.A.O . seemed ever more desperately determined to prevent it . During a single morning last week , 54 S.A.O . plastic bombs exploded in the Moslem quarter of Oran , burying families in the debris of tumbled tenements . The French army , torn between loyalty to De Gaulle and reluctance to give up Algeria , continued to show convenient blindness toward S.A.O . activities : Jeeploads of terrorists openly wore army-type uniforms and S.A.O . armbands . But there were signs , too , that the army was becoming increasingly disgusted with the S.A.O . <P> From time to time , army patrols cordoned off entire blocks in Oran and Algiers and seized quantities of S.A.O . guns and grenades in house-to-house searches . <P> The S.A.O . promptly made good its losses : a group of Europeans raided an Oran warehouse and made off with 205 pistols , rifles and submachine guns .
