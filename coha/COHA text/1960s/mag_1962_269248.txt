" I do n't know what 's wrong , " muttered Defending Champion Arnold Palmer on the eve of last week 's British Open at Troon , Scotland . " My back hurts . My drives are straying off to the right . I do n't know if I 'll ever learn how to putt again . I 'm just terrible-and I do n't even want to talk about it . " A photographer caught Palmer in a rare moment of pique ( see cut ) , after a 4-ft. putt went awry during a practice round . But his complaints cut few divots with Britain 's bookmakers , who installed him as the 2-to-1 favorite , or with his fellow pros . " Do n't you worry about old Arnie , " drawled Sam Snead . " ' There ai n't nothin ' wrong with him that a two-stroke lead wo n't fix . He 's just trying to sweet-talk that tough old course into lyin ' down and playin ' dead . " <P> Hard by the Firth of Clyde , the 84-year-old Troon course has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capricious shrew . It was at Troon in the 1923 British Open that 21-year-old Gene Sarazen , cocky 1922 U.S. Open champion , teed off into a howling gale sweeping in unannounced from the slate-grey firth , shot a horrendous 85 , and caught the next boat home . Even in the sunniest of weather , the championship 7,045-yd. course is a clutching jungle of harsh gorse , spiny Scotch broom and impenetrable whin bushes . Ditchlike burns and sheerfaced bunkers dot the threadbare fairways ; the postage-stamp greens are stubbly and unpredictable . Commuter trains clatter past while golfers sweat over tricky putts , and yowling jet airliners swoop low to land at Prestwick , only two miles away . <P> " It 's Impossible . " Britain 's best golfer , 49-year-old Dai Rees . who lost to Palmer by one stroke last year , failed to survive the 36-hole cut ; so did Gene Littler , the 1961 U.S. Open champion , and South Africa 's Gary Player , winner of the 1961 Masters . Complaining bitterly about the smaller British ball. *young Jack Nicklaus , conqueror of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29 ) . sprayed himself out of contention with a first round 80 . " An 80 ? " he moaned . " It 's impossible . I ca n't shoot 80 . " <P> But if Nicklaus and the rest were be wildered by Troon , Palmer was not . Wearing longjohns , his sore back swabbed with liniment , he fired a first-round 71 that left him tied for third . " I 'm leaving putts hanging all over the map . " he groaned as he headed for the clubhouse . And if that was the kind of sweet-sour talk old Troon liked to hear , it certainly worked . <P> Next day , Palmer 's cold putter suddenly turned hot : he shot a three-under-par 69 that put him two strokes ahead of the fast-fading pack . The critical play came at the fearsome . 485-yd. eleventh hole- " the worst hole I 've ever played , " said Palmer-where three players already had scored sextuple-bogey elevens and Nicklaus later staggered to a ten . Splitting the narrow fairway with a No. 1 iron . Palmer sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just 20 ft. from the pin . Coolly , he stepped up and sank the putt for an eagle 3 . <P> " It Was Shocking . " On the final day , Palmer took a lesson from his wife . " You 're moving your head when you putt , " she said . " I am ? " " Yes , you are . "
