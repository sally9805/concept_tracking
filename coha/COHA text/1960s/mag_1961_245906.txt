When the going gets rough on the overcrowded floor of the New York Stock Exchange , brokers with any ailments-sprained shoulders , sunburns or broken arms-pin red crosses on sleeve or back to warn off scurrying colleagues . Last week even brokers thus armed could hardly avoid a jostling . In furious trading inspired by the new bull market , volume on the exchange in one day leaped to 7,080,000 shares , highest mark in 5 years . The tape ran late so often that the warning clock that signals the tape 's tardiness was lit for hours at a stretch . As active stocks climbed to new highs , brokers let out great whoops . Trading on the American Stock Exchange was also heavy and hectic , with the biggest daily volume ( 3,872,420 shares ) since 1929 . <P> Observing all this bustle , New York Stock Exchange President Keith Funston decided that it was time to pin a red cross on speculators lest they get hurt . Disturbed by reports that many investors were scrambling to buy shares in firms " whose names they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose prospects are , at best , highly uncertain , " Funston delivered a sharp warning : " It is impossible to get something for nothing . Stock prices go down as well as up . Do n't invest on the basis of tips and rumors . " <P> Most brokers believed that the heavy speculation was being done by semipro investors who were switching from sound to risky investments ( often in the more volatile over-the-counter market ) in the hope of a quick killing in the rising mar ket . Bankers , also concerned about the speculative spree , reported a startling number of fund transfers from savings accounts to brokerage firms . Funston 's warning slowed the market down a bit ; volume slacked off and prices steadied . But by week 's end the market was off and running again . It gained 7.05 points for the week to close at 683.68 ( on the Dow-Jones industrial average ) , less than 2 points below its alltime high .                   @ @
