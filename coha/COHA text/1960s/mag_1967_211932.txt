In a decade of performing in the West , Indian Sitar Master Ravi Shankar , 47 , has won a devoted following among musicians from Jazzman Dave Brubeck to Beatle George Harrison . But only one notable Westerner has ever performed with him : Violinist Yehudi Menuhin , 51 , longtime apostle of Indian culture and faithful practitioner of yoga . The two met in India in 1952 , and Menuhin persuaded Shankar to play last summer at the Bath Festival in England . In what both performers termed " an experiment , " Menuhin practiced his violin for two days under Shankar 's coaching so that he could sit in on a raga . Clad in a raw-silk tunic and sitting cross-legged amid a haze of incense , Menuhin might indeed have passed for a native fidllist , except that he did not rest the head of his fiddle on his toe in the traditional Indian manner . <P> <P> The experiment was such a success that Shankar and Menuhin decided to expand on it in a London recording studio .

Menuhin plays two ragas worked out by Shankar ( the rest of the album is given over to a solo by Shankar and a performance of Enesco 's Sonata No. 3 by Menuhin and his pianist sister Hephzibah ) . On the first , a violin solo , Menuhin spins out a contemplative opening cadenza , progresses to some pizzicato syncopations , then , over the pitty-pat of tabla ( drums ) , skips and slides through a series of jaunty embellishments on the theme . On the second , he and Shankar engage in a long , rousing call-and-response pattern and a roller-coaster ensemble of rising and falling arpeggios , which leads , over steadily accelerating rhythms , to a climax of rhapsodic abandon . <P> Throughout the scored passages as well as the improvisations , Menuhin displays not only his accustomed technical brilliance but also an amazingly supple and knowing way with the complexities of the Indian musical idiom .
