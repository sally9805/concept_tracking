txt The renewed United Nations pressure on France to evacuate her naval base near Bizerte is unlikely to cause any great change in the French attitude , according to informed diplomatic quarters here . The new pressure came in the form of a resolution voted last night by the General Assembly at the close of a fiveday special session . ' Sixty-six nations voted for the resolution , none opposed it and thirty countries , including most of France 's allies , abstained . France boycotted the session . Niger and the Ivory Coast were absent . Tunisian leaders hailed the vote as a diplomatic victory . They said the next move was up to France . The resolution of the General Assembly calls for compliance with a Security Council demand of July 22 for a pull-back of all forces to positions they occupied before French and Tunisian forces began fighting July 19 . It declares that France 's presence in Bizerte against Tunisia 's wishes is a threat to peace and calls for negotiations leading to complete French evacuation of the base near Bizerte . Persons acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a settlement on Bizerte because of French considerations , and not because of the United Nations stand . Last April Presi- dent de Gaulle characterized the sessions of the General Assembly as " scandalous and tumultuous . " Two principal pressures are believed to be guiding the French leader . They are : 1 . The need to settle as quickly as possible France 's remaining overseas conflicts . The main conflict is in Algeria . The Bizerte question is closely linked to it . 2 . The need for France to devote her strength to meeting the Berlin crisis . U. S. to Press for Talks Adlai E. Stevenson pledged the United States last night to work " unflaggingly " to bring Tunisia and France together for talks . Virtually everyone in the United Nations agrees such talks are essential . Tunisia , as the aggrieved party , has gained the international diplomatic victory she was seeking , General de Gaulle is believed on all sides to desire a solution whatever the United Nations ' position . The combination of Tunisian diplomatic satisfaction and of the French leader 's desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end to the stalemate . This stalemate consists of ' French demands for a return to the normal situation prevailing in Bizerte before the fightling broke out and of the Tuinisians ' refusal to ease their ( pressure until France accepts the principle of evacuation . French Ask Guarantees The French feel they must have guarantees from the Tunisians that popular demonstrae tions or other attempts toe interfere with communications between the scattered points of the base will not recur . They . propose talks to deal with this , situation . The lack of such guarantees has led France to refuse to comply with the Seceirty Council injunction calling for a return to positions occupied before ' the fighting . France now occupies points outside the base , notably in Bizerte , which controls the entrance to the channel from the sea to the harbor . The General Assembly reaffirmed the Security Council 's injunction . Mongi Slim , the Tuniisan delegate , firmly barred any talks with France on any subject other than the methods and timetable of complete French evacuation . Unfortunate Results In the Western view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary to end the stalemate but also unfortunate in some of its results . It gave the Soviet bloc an opportunity to renew its propaganda drive against the Allied system of foreign bases . It gave Cuba a springboard to attack the United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay , which for Cuba is another Bizerte . The session showed up strains within the French Community of African nations . The former colonies felt obliged to side with Tunisia in the vote . The session also caused a breach in North Atlantic solidarity . Four members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , Turkey , Iceland , Denmark and Norway , sided with the majority . . The United States and Britain felt unable to forget the Atlantic alliance in the face of the Soviet threats to Berlin . They were thus made out to be unmindful of the rights of small nations . As Mr. Stevenson acknowledged , the United States did not have an easy role in abstaining on the vote .                  @ @ @
