The House of Representatives normally reapportions its 435 seats according to population changes reflected in each national census . And the last census established an average state population increase of 18.5% . No fewer than 25 state 's face the perils of reapportionment , either because they outstripped the average and gained seats , or because they fell below the average and lost . <P> Some states have already reapportioned with a minimum of confusion . Arizona laid out three congressional districts 14 years ago against the day the state outgrew its present two . This year , the Arizona legislature merely put the 1947 plan into effect , ignored the fact that the First District ( Phoenix ) has four times the population of the eight northern and eastern counties that comprise the new District Two . Maine , down from three Republican seats to two , simply split the state , left Incumbents Stanley Tupper and Peter A. Garland the problem of facing one another in the state 's First District . <P> <P> Eight Plus Three . In most states , however , party balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tactics are outwardly subtle . New Jersey Republicans chivalrously agreed to give the state 's 15th seat to booming Democratic Middlesex County ( pop . 433,856 ) , which deserved it . But by splitting Middlesex , the G.O.P. saved both Fifth District Republican Peter Frelinghuysen Jr . and Third District Republican James C. Auchincloss , who had shared not only Middlesex but also the inevitable danger of being defeated by its growing Democratic strength . More often , reapportionment is crude . North Carolina Democrats , obliged to cut twelve districts to eleven , worked a dachshund-shaped gerrymander ( a system of redistricting named after Elbridge Gerry , who , as Governor of Massachusetts in 1812 , designed a legislative district in the shape of a salamander ) in the Piedmont area designed to chew up lone Republican Charles Jonas . <P> Crudest and cruelest of the current reapportionment battles , however , was in California . Because population in ten years had increased by a whopping 48.5% , the state gained eight additional House seats , the largest pickup of any single state . In control of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats lovingly reworked boundary lines . Their handiwork ensures that all eight additional seats will probably be filled by Democrats . So will three other , normally Republican , districts , where lines were re-formed to include decisive numbers of Democrats . California Republicans , who worked much the same gerrymander ten years ago when they dominated the legislature , could only howl.
