In northern France 's cathedral city of Amiens one afternoon last week , 35,000 French farmers raged through the heart of town , smashing windows and stoning cops in a riot that left 70 farmers and 50 police injured . By general agreement , France 's farmers had legitimate cause for complaint : although they make up 25% of the population , they get only 10% of the national income. * De Gaulle 's abolition of a parity index hitching farm prices to market prices had hit them hard . But the indignant farmers at Amiens ( pop.100,000 ) were pushed into a rampaging mood by right-wing agitators who broke up their gathering with cries of " Vive null and " Algerie Franaise ! " The head of the farmers ' group was himself stoned to unconsciousness as he tried to quell the agitators . <P> Behind the violence at Amiens lay a desperate effort by France 's right wing to strike back at Charles de Gaulle on the mainland .

For Algeria 's European settlers , the most ominous move of all was the jailing ( on charges of " plotting against the security of the state " ) of 48-year-old Publisher de Srigny .

But last week , as police hauled him off to Algiers ' Barberousse Prison to join 1,000 imprisoned Moslem rebels , he muttered to himself over and over again : " A De Srigny in Barberousse ! It is impossible ! It is incomprehensible ! " Time to Talk . Said one Algerian Moslem happily : " Whatever is bad for De Srigny is good for us . " De Gaulle 's new assertion of authority over Algeria posed a problem to the leaders of Algeria 's five-year-old F.L.N. rebellion . Millions of uncommitted Moslems might become less eager to support the harsh cries of the rebel leadership . From neighboring Tunisia , rebel leaders leaked word that they were about to request peace talks on the basis of De Gaulle 's Algeria-wide self-determination offer of last September .                   @ @
