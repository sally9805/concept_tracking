Pope John <P> Sir : <P> What a happy choice for Man of the Year ! My congratulations on the splendid article , which did full credit to the outstanding Christian of the 20th century . I write as a Protestant with a John Knox background . <P> <P> CHARLES S. DREW St. Louis <P> Sir : <P> John XXIII is a marvelous example of how the immensities of theological disagreement can be transcended by simple human warmth and love . He has , above all , obeyed his Master 's command to love thy neighbor . <P> <P> ROBERT L. CAPIZZI Philadelphia <P> Sir : <P> What a bad choice ! Do you not know that we live in a post-Christian age ? Neither Christianity nor the Pope moves human history . Moreover , in 1962 , J.F.K. deflated both Blough and Barnett and checkmated Castro and Khrushchev . <P> <P> DEAN W. KOHLHOFF <P> Jacksonville , Ill . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Pope John dominated world Christendom , but John F. Kennedy dominated the world . <P> <P> TERRY D. ARANOFF The Bronx <P> Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is something left that Bobby ca n't manipulate . <P> If the White House cancels its subscription , I 'll take two . <P> <P> ROBERT M. CALVIN Chicago <P> Sir : <P> Pope John has neither begun a " revolution in Christianity " nor has he brought " Christianity to a new confrontation with the world . " Rather the reverse is true-the world has brought Christianity into a new confrontation with its own outdated and archaic beliefs and customs . <P> It is the Marxist and non-Marxist left movements of this age that command the attention of the peoples of the world . It is the left movements and the non-left reaction to these movements that are the salient characteristics of the 1960s . <P> <P> MICHAEL MCCRACKEN <P> President-elect <P> Young Peoples Socialist League Denver <P> Sir : <P> A most excellent choice . <P> One of the greatest aspects of this Council is not only the apparent freedom of the bishops in discussion and perhaps policymaking , not only the change in tradition and practice , but also-and more important-the as yet obscure but growing idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even outside the Church of Rome . Also , it is most encouraging to see the evident conciliation taking place in the Roman Catholic Church in regard to the " Separated Brethren . " Now we Protestants must take a closer look at ourselves to see if we will use and have used the mind and spirit of Christ instead of narrow provincialism in our dealings with Rome and with one another . ( THE REV . ) RICHARD PARKER YAPLE <P> First Christian Church <P> Cimarron , Kans . <P> <P> Ransom &; Tribute <P> Sir : <P> Glad to see TIME Dec. 28 call the Cuban ransom deal what it actually is : tribute . <P> I have never been so disgusted with my country as I am with it over this business of the ransom of the Bay of Pigs prisoners . <P> It is fine to give food and drugs to a needy nation , but please , not with the stigma of letting some rat like Castro force us to give it to him as tribute . <P> <P> EUGENE E. CARLTON San Bernardino , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
