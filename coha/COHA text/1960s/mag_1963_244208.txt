Says Alfred Renton Bridges ( every one calls him Harry ) , for 30 years the controversial boss of West Coast dock workers , in his Australian cockney accent : " If someone wants to get me out of this job , the best way would be to call me a ' labor statesman . ' " Yet that , in effect , is what a lot of people who do not want him out of his job are calling him nowadays . Examples : <P> &gt; Says Eisenhower 's Secretary of Labor James Mitchell , who now lives in San Francisco : " Next only to John L. Lewis , Bridges has done the best job in American labor of coming to grips with the problems of automation . " <P> &gt; Says Clark Kerr , president of the University of California and a specialist in labor-management relations : " Anyone who 's seen Bridges off and on over the years has to be impressed with the changes that have been made since 1934 . In 1934 longshoremen were sort of leftovers from society , men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aristocrats of labor . " <P> &gt; Says Stanley Powell , president of the Matson shipping line : " I do n't know how the guy who sat at this desk 30 years ago felt about Bridges , but I know it was a hell of a lot different from the way I feel . I admire his ability to keep his word and get his union to back him up . " <P> Such tributes stem from the fact that Bridges , far more than most labor leaders , has faced the challenge of automation . In 1960 his International Longshoremen 's and Warehousemen 's Union reached an agreement with management 's Pacific Maritime Association . Under that pact the employers can introduce as many labor-saving machines as they wish - at a price of $5,000,000 a year in retirement and other benefits for Bridges ' boys . The agreement is paying off for both shippers and dock workers . <P> Stinking Copra . Last week a crew of six San Francisco longshoremen finished the nine-day job of unloading 7,000 tons of stinking , oil-laden copra from the Liberty ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holds , hoisted it into a vacuum tube that shot it into a conversion plant . A few years ago 18 men would have worked two weeks to unload the Silvana . <P> Similarly , it used to take six days to transfer a load of passenger cars off Matson 's Hawaiian Motorist ; the ship can now dock , unload and be back at sea in seven hours . Where 14-man gangs worked twelve shifts to load cargo containers into a Matson ship , a ten-man gang can now perform the complete loading job in just two shifts . <P> Under the agreement , Bridges gave up most of his union 's featherbedding " work rules " - although not precisely in any spirit of generosity . His longshoremen now get a basic $3.19 an hour for a guaranteed 35 hours a week . The agreement 's kitty permits a 25-year man to retire at 62 , draw a $220 monthly pension for three years , $115 after that ( when Social Security begins ) . If an I.L.W.U. man works until 65 , he gets an additional lump sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work , he continues to draw 35 hours of pay a week . The deal is so good that last year the I.L.W.U. had some 25,000 applicants for 2,600 openings . <P> The shippers have no beef , mainly because they save in dock charges-up to $2,500 a day-when ships turn about faster .
