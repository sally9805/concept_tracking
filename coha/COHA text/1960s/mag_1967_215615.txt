As the South Vietnamese Air Force DC-3 approached the mountain resort town of Dalat , Premier Nguyen Cao Ky left the passenger compartment , took over the controls and skillfully guided the plane down onto the tiny airstrip . Soon after landing , he summoned reporters to the lovely presidential palace once used by President Diem and announced that he would run for President in the Sept. 3 elections . <P> Did that mean that Ky would be the ruling generals ' military candidate against the five civilians who have so far thrown their hats into the ring ? Yes , said Ky : " There will be no other military candidate . " As for General Nguyen Van Thieu , Chief of State and Ky 's chief rival among the generals , Ky said : " I will never oppose him , but I do not think General Thieu will run . " Then he added thoughtfully : " Although nothing is certain in Viet Nam . " <P> It was a prudent afterthought . Back in Saigon , Thieu announced that it was " entirely possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all , he said , " we want a hard campaign , with as many candidates as possible . " Thieu allowed as how he had an informal election staff already at work and planned a number of " inspection tours " throughout Viet Nam in June , but as a matter of " little tactics " might delay a formal declaration of his candidacy until the July 5 filing deadline . It all spoke well for Viet Nam 's evolving sense of democracy , if perhaps not so well for the internal harmony of the nation 's military establishment , which is about equally divided between supporters of Ky and Thieu.
