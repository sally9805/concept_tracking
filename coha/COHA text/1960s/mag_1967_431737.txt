 | The Great Research Boondoggle LasT OCTOBER in Washington , D.C. , newsmen were summoned to a press conference le offices of the Bureau of Social : Ice Research , Inc . There publi , n was announced of a new book hich the Federal Bureau of Ingation was assailed for exaggerthe nation 's crime rate . Headlines carried the sweeping : k . Less publicized was this fact : national Aeronautics and Space ) inistration ( NASA ) ladled out , 000 to finance the study . Why ? ) 1y because NASA thought thatsponsoring such research , so remote from its official mission , would , in the words of a Washington Post reporter , lend it an image of " social concern " ! Fantastic as it may seem , the foregoing is a fairly typical episode in today 's Washington . At this moment , when we are being told that government is paring expenditures to the bone , scores of similar projects are being financed in the sacrosanct name of " research " by a maze of government bureaus . What we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it has mounted to absurd proportions . No one denies that U.S.-supported research has led to gains in military @# THE READER 'S DIGEST M  | technology , health and science . But this government-subsidized " research and development , " now the second largest item in the bloated federal budget , has multiplied five times in the past decade ? to a staggering total of $16 billion a year . Inevitably , this unchecked proliferation has brought on vast boondoggles , and also a regrettable waste of scientific manpower . Researchers and scientists are alarmed . Famed biologist Dr. Paul A. Weiss , now on the staff of New York 's Rockefeller University , says that the excessive federal largess has encouraged " shoddy , redundant , uncritical and ill-conceived research . " Basil O'Connor , president of the National Foundation-March of Dimes , - says , " The log-rolling and sheer waste which accompany ill-advised , massive government appropriations could undermine the public 's confidence in the whole scientific enterprise . " Most concerned of all is Congress . A half-dozen committees have launched full-scale investigations , audited books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After years of hacking his way through the complex jungle of federal research , Rep. Richard Roudebush , of the House Science and Astronautics Committee , concludes that there have been " senseless , tragic abuses of legitimate scientific inquiry . " The Indiana lawmaker says bluntly : " The public has been taken . " Here are the main reasons why : Everybody 's in the act . Recently , the Library of Congress tempted to index the government sprawling research program . A months of digging , the Library 's perts reported that no one in federal government knows precisely how many government-support laboratories are in operation , where they are located or what they doing . The Defense Department , Atomic Energy Commission , National Institutes of Health , National Science Foundation NASA are the giants of federal research . But more than 30 of agencies have hopped aboard bandwagon . The Office of Education in the Department of Health Education and Welfare spends than $100 million a year on research ventures , among them : " Understanding the Fourth-Grade Slump in Creative Thinking . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in minute detail the difference between curved and crooked pickles . The Commerce Department a private accounting firm to mine why shipping rates are 1 on imported goods than on expo ones . Among the explanations : more expensive to load and cargo than to unload it . " Chairman John Rooney , of the House aspriations subcommittee over Commerce , blew up . " Did you to spend $95,000 to find that out asked . " Any hatch boss on  | Brooklyn waterfront could have given you the answer , without cost . " One consequence of the research craze is that federal agencies have orbited into areas far beyond their legitimate purview . For example , despite the reams of election analyses offered by news media , the National Science Foundation has doled out taxpayer dollars for a computerized study of the 1966 Maryland gubernatorial campaign . Much of the federally financed research fails to meet what a House Government Operations subcommittee has termed " the test of urgency . " The number of trivial projects has led one prominent scientist to exclaim : " We see bewildered youngsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fashionable words from recent literature , then reshuffling and recombining them into another conglomerate , both un1gested and indigestible . Narrow pecialists lavish their pet techniques in yet another dozen ways n what has already been superbundantly established to everyone 's satisfaction . " Many projects are " makework . " Sen. William Proxmire , of the Senate Appropriations Committee , has repeatedly accused federal officials of engaging in " research for he sake of research , " in costly projcts of little benefit to the taxpayer . And the worst offender of all , " Proxmire adds , " is the National Institutes of Health . " The Senator maintains that there can be no justi-93 fication for NIH support last year of such marginal projects as " A Social History of French Medicine , 1789-1815 " ( $11,782 ) ; " Emergence of Political Leadership : Indians in Fiji " ( $10,917 ) ; and " Changing Patterns of ( Moslem ) Family Life " ( $28,755 ) . The research bug has also bitten the commanding generals of the War on Poverty . Hardly a month goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucrative contracts to private researchers who operate what the magazine New Republic terms a " profitable parasite industry at the fringes of government . " National Analysts Inc. , a Philadelphia research firm , was asked , for instance , to gauge " low-income " reaction to " It 's What 's Happening , Baby ! " , a nationally televised rock ' n ' roll show extolling the Job Corps . Critics roasted the program as " tasteless , degrading and obscene , " but OEO shelled out $39,000 to determine why some underprivileged youths reacted favorably to it , while others did not . The National Science Foundation has financed individual foreign junkets of what might well be considered dubious worth . Consider the case of Stephen Smale , a University of California mathematician working on an NSF project who spent the summer of 1966 traveling in Europe , with taxpayers picking up the $6556 tab . A virulent foe of U.S. policy in Vietnam , Smale had organized California demonstrations  | aimed at halting troop trains . In Paris , he helped draft an anti-American resolution . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press conference at which ? although he attacked Moscow 's repressive intellectual atmosphere ? he called what his own government was doing in Vietnam " much more dangerous and brutal " than the Soviets ' massacre of Hungarian freedom fighters ten years earlier . Outraged , Representative Roudebush fired off an angry letter to NSF director Leland Haworth , insisting that federal tax funds should not be used to send abroad individuals who would " run down the policies of the United States government . " ? Universities scramble for the dollars . Government agencies annually underwrite $2 billion in university research alone . Intensive investigation convinced the members of the House Subcommittee on Research and Technical Programs that massive research grants have actually harmed higher education by " excessively diverting scientific manpower from teaching . " Rep. Henry S. Reuss , chairman of this group , estimates that more than 40,000 faculty members have left the classrooms to work on federally financed research . He echoes the warning of Dr. W. T. Lippincott , a professor of chemistry at Ohio State University , that government support of research is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ever faced . " One institution , the University of California , receives $400 million a year in federal research funds ? and leading members of its faculty are apprehensive about this . Sociology professor Robert A. Nisbet recently charged that many of the research projects at California and other large public universities could " more easily and appropriately be placed in non-university settings . " He noted disapprovingly the growing practice in many universities of opening Washington offices , manned by " experts in the art of catching the scent of dollars over the horizon . " ( More than two dozen colleges and universities now employ Washington lobbyists . ) Several colleges receive more than 40 percent of their operating budgets from federal research projects . The vast majority of these grants go to a relatively few universities . Result ? Says a North Dakota educator : " The small institutions have been subject to so much faculty raiding by the more successful applicants for federal research funds that higher education of acceptable quality is moving beyond the reach of many young Americans . " ? Smoke screens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress to question the massive research expenditures earmarked for " national defense . " But the Special Investigating Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee uncovered a shocking situation when it probed the Aerospace Corporation , a " non-profit , " Pentagon- created missile-research firm . To put it bluntly ? and the subcommittee did ? Aerospace officials have been getting fat at the public trough . For instance , president Ivan Getting received a pay hike of $45,000 when he left private industry ( Raytheon Co. ) and joined Aerospace at $90 , - 000 a year ? a salary more than double that paid to Defense Secretary Robert McNamara . In addition , Getting was given a $350,000 lifeinsurance policy , a retirement program that costs taxpayers $9000 a vcar , and an expense account that revered such incidentals as $3113 for transporting his yacht from Massachusetts to California . Investigators for the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee uncovered a similar situation when ey audited the books of another vernment-financed research firm . ne of its vice presidents , apparently nable to make ends meet on a $42 , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another $22,381 n taxpayer funds for the mortgage ayments and caretaker fees of his rivate estate . From 1956 to 1964 , the entagon funneled more than $40 million into this firm . Yet nowhere n the government files are records f its contract negotiations to be ound . Appropriations Committee Chairman George Mahon says flatly that the records , required by law , " do not exist . " Then consider the infamous case f Project Mohole , unveiled in 1961 s a " truly exciting " attempt to gain knowledge of our planet 's structure by boring a hole three miles beneath the bottom of the Pacific Ocean into the mantle of the earth . National Science Foundation officials assured Congress that the project would cost no more than $2o million . Within five years they had hiked the price tag to $127 million ! Why the spiraling cost ? The record shows that an NSF panel set up in 1961 to review potential contractors rated the Texas firm of Brown and Root as least qualified of five companies under consideration . Nevertheless , Brown and Root ( with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with White House connections ) was later awarded the Mohole contract , at a price almost double the lowest bid . By 1966 , Project Mohole was so far behind schedule that disgusted members of the House Appropriations Committee refused to approve that year 's $19.7 million request . But at this point the President made an extraordinary appeal for the restoration of funds , as did administration lobbyists . Then came the bombshell . It became known that shortly before the President turned the screws on a reluctant Congress , the family of Brown and Root 's board chairman , George Brown , had contributed $23,000 to the " President 's Club , " a Democratic fund-raising group . Outraged Congressmen now killed off Mohole ? at least temporarily . ? Research dollars are used to influence public opinion . The Pentagon , often accused of news man- agement , contracted in 1966 for a $69,400 study of public reaction to controlled press releases and the withholding of information . The project was canceled only after Rep. John Moss , crusading chairman of the House Subcommittee on Government Information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . " The Office of Economic Opportunity announced with fanfare last year that it would hire prominent social scientists to conduct " independent " " appraisals of the War on Poverty . What the OEO did n't say was that anti-poverty officials would retain absolute authority to prohibit publication of the investigators ' findings . " These scholarly studies of the War on Poverty will be used to defend future budget requests and to persuade public opinion , " the Washington Post commented sharply . " The public , which is paying for them , would like to see the adverse results as well as the favorable ones . " FIFTEEN MILES from downtown Washington , in Springfield , Va. , stands the Clearinghouse for Federal Scientific and Technical Information , a brick-and-glass monument to government 's obsession with research . Occupied for less than three years , the 30,000-square-foot warehouse is already bulging at the seams . Nearly half a million federally financed scientific reports are stacked in piles 15 feet high , and as many as 65,000 more are expected this year . Government publicists grandiosely speak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists dissent . Dr. Paul Weiss , for one , argues that the sheer number of reports is no more indicative of progress than " the amount of junk mail reflects economic growth . " It is time , he says , to replace the fetish of unfettered research with the maxim that scientific inquiry " should have a purpose and be selected with a sense of relevance . " At its current rate of increase , th annual price tag for federal research is expected to reach $20 billion bpi 1970 . Here is an opportunity for a political leaders who believe in r sponsible government to expres themselves . Here is a specific ar where , irrefutably , the monstrou federal budget can be cut ? now . @#
