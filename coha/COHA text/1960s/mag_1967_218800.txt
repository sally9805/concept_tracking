Arriving at Manhattan 's NBC news studios , leased for the premiere of the Public Broadcast Laboratory ( TIME , Nov. 10 ) , Executive Director Av Westin last week found a note left by the regular occupants . " The moneymen of Huntley-Brinkley , " the message read , " hope you do-gooders do good . Good luck ! " PBL will need some luck ; it did n't do so good . <P> For a project that promised " to use television as it has never been used before , " the 21-hour program seemed rather familiar . Correspondents skipped breathlessly across the mayoralty-campaign battlegrounds of Gary , Cleveland and Boston , concentrating on the racist atmosphere . The commercial networks had been there before , and about as thoroughly . A raw one-act satire about racial attitudes in the south-Day of Absence , by Negro Dramatist Douglas Turner Ward-was allowed to run from here to eternity : 60 minutes . <P> PBL came most powerfully to life during a " confrontation " -a free-for-all discussion of racial antagonisms in which " someone in that crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Negroes gathered in a Chicago studio to blast away at one another . A Negro evangelical preacher reported that " our program is to try to solve the problem with love . " " When he says Christian love , " snorted Black Revolutionary Russ Meek , " he means Uncle Tomism ! You 're a disgrace to the race ! " A Negro adolescent follower of Meek said : " I 'm for violence , because we have pleaded for the last 400 years ! " A Negro woman snapped : " I 've been integrated all I need to be integrated ! I 've got these freckles and this red hair as a result of the rape that took place on my great-grandmother in Mississippi ! I do n't need any more integration ! " <P> Notwithstanding its fiery moments , the debate was curiously lopsided ; whether by accident or design , there was no white adversary present who could summon the intelligence and articulation to represent a moderate point of view . <P> Some of the southern stations in PBL 's 119-station line-up opted out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicious of the tone it would take . But most of them were expected back by this week . Fred Friendly , who as TV consultant to the Ford Foundation helped get the project started , confessed that he was " very disappointed " with the first broadcast . But , he added , quite properly : " Wait till next week-that 's the great thing about TV. "
