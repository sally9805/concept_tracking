Next to a conclave of cardinals , probably the most secret religious assembly is the annual meeting of The Mother Church , The First Church of Christ , Scientist . Last week more than 7,000 of the faithful showed up in Boston to hear the yearly report on how their made-in-America faith is doing . Names and church standing were carefully checked before admission tickets were granted , and reporters of other faiths were barred from the four auditoriums where the proceedings were held . <P> The curbs help keep secret such statistics as membership figures , but they do not hide internal dissension : there is none . Christian Science is autocratically governed by a board of five directors with lifetime tenure who make all the major decisions for the church . Among them is the choice of Christian Science 's president , who serves for a year as chief spokesman for the faith . The leader presented to this year 's meeting was German-born Edward Froderman , a trustee of the church 's Publishing Society , who gave up a vice-presidency of a Chicago bank 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baker Eddy 's healing doctrine . <P> Quickening . Mrs. Eddy passed on , as Christian Scientists put it , in 1910 , but her spirit looms heavily over the church . Christian Science still affirms her central belief that evil-including physical illness-can be conquered through faith and understanding , although members are free to consult doctors if they want to , as Mrs. Eddy herself did . Along with the Bible , her major work , Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures , is regarded as divine revelation , but there is never any theological debate in the church about how it should be interpreted . Christian Scientists feel that there is no need to modernize her teachings , and , says Board Chairman Inman Douglass , " within the church organization there is no controversy on this point , no differing of opinion , no liberal and conservative wings . No , nothing like that . " <P> Christian Science in the past has often seemed as sober and conservative as its best-known creation , the daily Monitor ( circ. 190,000 ) . Now there seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both at home and abroad . U.S. " branches " of the Mother Church total 2,449 , up 106 in a decade , and foreign branches now number 819 . Best outside guess at membership : 400,000 . Forty new Christian Science clubs have been formed on U.S. college campuses . <P> Modernization . Lately , too , a number of relatively young members have taken over responsible positions in the church and tried to modernize its approach to evangelism . Among the signs of change : the $700,000 Christian Science Pavilion at the New York World 's Fair , a paperback edition of Science and Health . <P> Says Harvard-trained Robert Peel , of the church 's Committee on Publication : <P> " Like many small groups , we started with a great deal of persecution and were put on the defensive . But as the movement has grown , Christian Science has begun to reach out to society as a whole . "
