Beaches are a matter of personal taste . Under the impression that popularity spells quality , the timid tourist is apt to want his beaches garnished with multicolored parasols , well-lotioned nymphs , and even a lifeguard thrown in for good measure . But a few intrepid travelers still like their beaches au naturel , and more and more are discovering that some of the most beautiful , unspoiled beaches in the world are to be found between two remote little towns named Antalya and Anamur on the south coast of Turkey . Framed against the Taurus mountain range that rises sharply to the north , and edged with orange , lemon , olive and fig trees , the 100-mile " Turkish Riviera " is every adventurer 's midsummer daydream come true . It offers every variety of beach , from powdered sand to pebble to worn rocks . Here and there , cool mountain streams spill over steep cliffs into small , semitropical coves , and everywhere unexploited ruins lend an air of timeless tranquillity . Marble columns stand cool and sublime amongst pine trees , crusaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jut out into the ocean . Most wonderful of all , the coast is virtually devoid of tourists . The reason is simple enough . Most of the Turkish Riviera has barely been touched by the 20th century . The hotels are few and Spartan , the food is good but unfamiliar , the night life is nil , and travel is tortuous . Overland , the only means of reaching the coast from Istanbul is a two-day trip over winding , pot-holed roads . But none of these problems plague most visitors to the Turkish Riviera-they come by sea . Crowded out of Monte Carlo and tired of touring the Greek islands , members of the international yachting set have begun to drop their anchors and their passengers near Turkey 's untrammeled delights . Among the yachts that recently graced the port of Antalya were the three-masted schooner Sylvia , owned by Fiat Vice Chairman Gianni Agnelli , and the black 245-ton schooner Taitu , owned by Italian Builder Giorgio Varvaro . The Turkish government is slowly becoming aware that it has a priceless tourist asset in the area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Istanbul to a modest $12 in order to lure newcomers . Since the cut rates went into effect eight weeks ago , the flights have been jammed . Turks and a few adventurous Europeans are heading for the place where a good room on the beach costs only $1.50 to $3 a night , and a seven-room house ( with plumbing ) goes for about $150 monthly .
