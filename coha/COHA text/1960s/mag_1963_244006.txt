Four Communist soldiers from North Korea last week started a nasty little war of their own . Sneaking across the military demarcation line that divides Korea into Communist north and U.S.-supported south , they hid beside a road some six miles from the Joint Security Area at Panmunjom . At 5:30 a.m. , a Jeep bounced along the rutted road carrying three U.S. enlisted men of the 9th Cavalry Regiment , bound for an observation point on a nearby hill . They never made it . The North Koreans blasted the Jeep from the road with a shower of grenades . Pfc Charles Dessart , 19 , of Drexel Hill , Pa. , and Private David Seiler , 24 , of Theresa , Wis. , were killed ; Pfc William Foster , 26 , of Baltimore was badly wounded . <P> Death in the Reeds . Instead of retreating to their own lines , the North Korean quartet pushed on south , passing safely through the 2,000 yards of the demilitarized zone , crossing the Imjin River , and entering a grassy bottomland bordered by reeds the height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm boy , who raced to notify South Korean military police . Joined by a detail of U.S. troops , the police challenged the invaders , who opened fire , killing Corporal George Larion , 24 , of Davison , Mich. , and a South Korean policeman . <P> Two of the Communists died in the 25-minute running fire fight , but the other two escaped and were trailed northward by a growing force of G.I.s and South Koreans . Four helicopters flew low overhead , and their prop wash parted the reeds and kept the running North Koreans in sight . At midafternoon , exhausted and surrounded , each Communist pulled the pin from a grenade , fell upon it and committed suicide . <P> The four North Koreans , it turned out , had carried bundles of civilian clothes ( including a coat bearing the label of a Seoul tailor ) , faked South Korean identity cards , rations for 15 days and $4,000 in U.S. money . Obviously , they had intended to infiltrate South Korea , but why had they jeopardized their mission by the ambush of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been spotted by a U.S. patrol and had therefore opened fire . <P> Bloodthirsty Marauders . But it is also possible that , after a decade of the half-forgotten Korean armistice , marked only by minor skirmishes and routine infiltration attempts , the Chinese-dominated North Koreans now want to prod and poke the U.S. For days , the North Korean radio has been ranting that the " U.S. imperialist troops ' - must be driven from South Korea . Al week 's end a sizable group of Communist soldiers boldly penetrated 500 yards into the U.S. sector and waged a two-hour skirmish with U.S. patrols . <P> U.S. Marine Corps Major General George Cloud called the 176th meeting of the Military Armistice Commission at Panmunjom and delivered a blistering attack on his Communist opposite number , sleepy-eyed General Chung Hwan Chang , demanding that he curb his " bloodthirsty marauders . " Chang insolently replied that North Korea was not at fault and that , undoubtedly , " you have deliberately murdered some of your own personnel in a scheme serving your political purposes . " When Cloud displayed a collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chang picked up " a pistol and made as if to shoot the American . " Where is your dignity ? " snapped Cloud . General Chang put the pistol down .
