To Navy weaponeers used to thinking in terms of quick-firing 5-in. guns or huge Polaris missiles , the assignment at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington was far out of line . Their task : to make a gun that could be fired point-blank inside the human head-not to kill but to save . The unusual technical feat required even more unusual ammunition : a piece of hair only one two-hundredth of an inch in diameter and one-fourth of an inch long , which had to pierce something even less resistant than a toy balloon , and do it with such delicate force that it would not come out the other side . <P> But Harrison P. Hagemeyer , 62 , a retired lab machinist , took on the job , for a good personal reason , and made the gun . Last week the Navy was confident that eventually it will save many lives . <P> The man behind the gun was Georgetown University 's Neurosurgeon John P. Gallagher , who wanted a safe way to treat aneurysms in the brain . Aneurysms are like blisters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an artery balloons out . The stretched wall is so thin that any rise in blood pressure caused by excitement or strain may burst it . Occasionally and unpredictably , the break is self-sealing and the scar may make the artery wall stronger than before , but more often a fatal flood of blood is spilled into the brain cavity . Usually , the aneurysm first develops a warning leak that causes a severe headache and stiff neck , and a test will then show blood in the spinal fluid . Among the estimated 100,000 cases of brain aneurysm each year in the U.S.-most of them caused by congenital weakness of an artery-probably 50,000 patients ' lives might be saved if the patients could be treated effectively in the aneurysm 's early stages . But how ? <P> Hair of the Hog . Even getting at the aneurysm , which is nearly always at the base of the brain in the arterial traffic rotary ( " circle of Willis " ) , is a major operation . It involves sawing through and lifting a flap of skull and moving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment has been to tie off the aneurysm at its stem with a tiny silver clip , or close the artery with clips on each side of the stem . Dr. Gallagher was not satisfied with these methods because merely touching the aneurysm to attach a clip might cause it to burst with disastrous results . To destroy the aneurysm with no risk of bleeding , he wanted to clot all the blood inside it . To make the blood clot , he needed to get a foreign body into it-such as a hair . And to get the hair in without disturbing the aneurysm , he needed a hair gun . So the Navy made him an air hair gun . It is a muzzle-loader , works on air at 50 lbs . pressure . <P> The hair , though thin , had to be stiff . Dr. Gallagher tried hair from the heads of Orientals . No good . He tried coarse eyebrow hairs . Not much better . Then he found that hog 's hair was scaly enough to cause clotting , and stiff enough to be fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tail .
