Fifty-Fifty Some are muddle-headed enough to think they can have a nonproliferation nuclear treaty and a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union as well . They are mistaken . The treaty , which 8o countries have approved but nobody has yet ratified , limits the number of military nuclear powers to five : The US , Russia , Britain ? and France and China , which had no part in drafting it and are singularly uninterested in what happens to it . Mr. Nixon , who seems to believe that American ratification of the treaty will do the Soviet Union a favor , opposed Senate action on it when the Russians marched into Czechoslovakia . But it will come up again when the Senate convenes on January 6 , at which time it certainly ought to be ratified . But there ought also to be acute public awareness that it will be worth little if the United States and Russia get into a new arms race . Countries like Israel and India are likely to spurn the treaty in that event , others will follow and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the most , there will be not five but ten or twelve nuclear powers in the world , which may be why Arthur Goldberg last week gave mankind only a 50-5o chance of survival . Article VI of the treaty obliges this country and Russia to negotiate on halting their nuclear arms race " at an early date . " If such missile talks get going , President Nixon could try to persuade the Russians to give up their primitive anti-ballistic missile system , presumably by promising that the US wo n't try to develop a more sophisticated ABM . But how much does Nixon want to head off an arms race ? He and his people have talked and seem still to be talking almost entirely in terms of more missiles , more bombers , an ABM that will be effective against Russia as well as China . The Nixon men show a deep interest in what they call comparative destruction . Their argument has been that even though the US has more missiles than Russia , we lag in the relative amount of destruction we ) can inflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Soviet Union . So they 'd like a missile edge of about ten to one . ( According to Defense Secretary Clifford , the US missile edge over Russia is now about three to one . ) A ten to one edge would be eveh less tolerable to Russia than the present three to one margin is . The target of missile talks ought to be a cutback to what Clifford 's predecessor , Robert McNamara , called parity . At that point , neither superpower has got nuclear superiority , . but they have " mutual capability to destroy one another " which , McNamara told Congress , provides both of them with " the strongest possible motive to avoid a strategic nuclear war . " Parity is probably well below the levels of missiles now existing in both countries . Congress was loath to heed McNamara , however , and it kept trying to make him acquire more strategic weapons than he felt he needed . Finally , his and President Johnson 's arms were twisted into an initial ABM allotment of $1,195,600,000 . Under Nixon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1.00 billion , for the President-elect has announced he agrees with senators who said in the debate on the defense appropriations that a " thin " ABM aimed ostensibly at shooting down Chinese missiles is insufficient , what 's needed is a " thick " ABM defense against Russian missiles . Last week 's Russian budget forecast a slight cut next year in arms spending as a percentage of total government expenditures . The Russians are spending about $50 billion on defense , to this country 's $74 billion . But Nixon 's campaign headquarters said on November 3 that Nixon " hoped " by 1972 to have raised US defense spending to a whopping $87 billion ? a figure which . assumed a Vietnam peace . Will that be the view of President Nixon and Secretary of Defense Laird ? Presumably it is not the view of the outgoing Secretary , who spoke the other day of the " useful benefits " to ourselves and the Soviets from an early agreement to limit strategic offensive and defensive missiles . What happens if this country and Russia push on with large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ? Carl Kaysen warns that " each side could believe it had a first-strike capability ; its MIRVs could be used to attack the adversary 's fixed missile launchers and its ABM defenses to intercept " missiles . That would signal the end of the balance of terror , McNamara 's parity concept , and in due course much of the world 's population . Long before then , a nonproliferation treaty would have ceased to hold anyone 's interest . By getting into a new arms race , this country and Russia would be destroying the nonproliferation treaty , by cynically requesting others not to acquire nuclear weapons at the very time they were furiously adding to their own already vast stocks of such weapons . It is almost two years since Hans Morgenthau warned what the outcome of such a double standard must be : " As long as the present nuclear powers continue to compete for the accumulation of nuclear weapons and delivery systems as instruments of their national policies , there appears to be no possibility of preventing other nations from following suit . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world edges closer and closer to a point of no return on the road to a nuclear , third and last world war . Few statesmen have had a graver responsibility than now falls to Richard Nixon . Mr. Nixon 's Cabinet Watching the President-elect present his Cabinet to the nation over television recalls a remark that Richard Nixon made about himself , and another that Senator Thruston Morton of Kentucky made about Mr. Nixon during the campaign . " I am not blessed with particular social grace , " the candidate said . Sen. Morton 's remarks occurred in the course of discouraging the assumption , common at the time , that either Governor Nelson Rockefeller or his brother , David , would surely turn up in any Nixon Cabinet . " This fellow , " Sen. Morton said , speaking with prescient informality of his friend Richard Nixon , " is not about to have anybody around him that he will have to play second fiddle to . " Much else , and much that is good , is to be said of Mr. Nixon 's choices for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff . But the trait acknowledged by him in that glancing way and noted by Sen. Morton has had and predictably will have more to do with the shape and tone of the Nixon Presidency than any other single factor . His Cabinet reflects it and affirms his determination , announced plainly and often , to be the unquestioned master and the only star performer in his Administration . He said when he introduced the chosen twelve that he did not want and had not assembled " a Cabinet of yes-men . " This they are not . But , taken as a group , they do not promise the " superior or even great leadership " in their fields that Mr. Nixon professes to expect and tells the country to expect of them . Certainly they do not comprise the Cabinet that Mr. Nixon had told the nation to expect , " a Cabinet made up of the ablest men in America , leaders in their own right and not merely by virtue of appointment . " What his Cabinet appointments indicate , beyond all else , is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he is . So the country is still left with the question , oddly open about a man so long in national office and in the public glare , of how good Richard Nixon really is and whether he is fitted to be President . We know , however , from the President-elect 's Cabinet choices , quite a lot about him and his approach to the Presidency that previously had either to be surmised or accepted as true , simply because he and others said it was true . We know , for example , that he values competence more than commitment at the peaks of government . He values the competence of generalists , men who by repute can do anything , or at least and in theory tell other people what to do and how to do it , more than he values the competence of specialists at the power level ( it is , he said proudly , " a Cabinet not just of specialists but of generalists " ) . We also know , and this is now beyond dispute , that Mr. Nixon seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from the black , the poor , the estranged young . He claims for himself , and he has appointed men to whom he attributes , " a passionate concern " for the country 's cheated millions and " a passionate ' missionary zeal " to bring " our people together . " But Mr. Nixon expresses the passion very coolly and his Cabinet appointments do not express it with discernible warmth . The only Negro in the Johnson Cabinet is displaced . There is no Negro in the Nixon Cabinet . The awkward display at the introductory TV extravaganza of one Negro designated for reappointment , the Mayor of Washington , said all that needs to be said and more than should have to be said in evidence of a ' fundamental and critical lack of social sensitivity ( " social grace " aside ) on Mr. Nixon 's part . With this said , we note with something more than a modicum of hope that the Nixon Cabinet , viewed narrowly as an instrument of government , is of a higher quality than might have been expected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of pronounced commitment to the policies of the Kennedy-Johnson years may be a very good ' thing indeed , if it does not carry with it an equivalent lack of commitment to anything more than getting by with the least for the least and getting Mr. Nixon reelected in 1972 . The absence of a single Democrat in the Cabinet proper is interesting but not mightily disturbing , since the only prominent Democrat known to have turned down a place in it is Sen. Henry M. Jackson of ' Washington , who as Secretary of Defense would have sensationally failed to satisfy Mr. Nixon 's avowed yen for a regime of " new men with new ideas . " Vice President Humphrey , who was invited and declined to take the marginal Cabinet post of Ambassador to the UN , would have demeaned himself if he had astounded Mr. Nixon by accepting the offer . Sen. Eugene McCarthy , who was asked by a Nixon emissary whether he would be interested in the same job , would have been miserable in it and the possibility , never a real one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promise that he would replace Mr. McCarthy with another Minnesota Democrat , Congressman John Blatnik . Richard Nixon being the partisan Republican he is , it is just as well for him and his Administration that he wound up with an all Republican Cabinet . William P. Rogers , who is to be the Secretary of State , presumably meets Mr. Nixon 's proclaimed requirement that his appointee to that office agree with the President-elect 's " strong convictions about the necessity for strengthening the United States , dealing with the Soviet Union from a position of strength , and negotiating where we can a reduction of the tensions that might lead to war " ? and also " join with mein cleaning house in the State Department . " We have to say " presumably " because Rogers ' current views on foreign policy are a total blank . As President Eisenhower 's Deputy Attorney General and Attorney General , he put what little muscle there was in the federal effort of those years to enforce compliance with the Supreme Court 's finding of 1954 that racial segregation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the US delegation to the UN in 1965 , he did all that Johnson policy and his modest rank permitted in the interest of human rights everywhere . His record as an official and as an exi:remely successful private lawyer substantiates Mr. Nixon 's estimate that " His judgment is good . He is cool . He is a superb negotiator . " But , and to say it is not to derogate William Rogers , his primary value to Mr. Nixon lies in his past friendship with and loyalty to the President-elect , who has reason to know that he can expect his Secretary of State to conduct himself and Nixon 's policy precisely as Mr. Nixon wishes . And that , with the possible exception of scratchy Governor George Romney of Michigan ( Housing and Urban Development ) , is the quality that Mr. Nixon clearly sought above all others in the rest of his Cabinet . Rep. Melvin Laird of Wisconsin ( Defense ) sounds in his voluminous statements on military policy so like Mr. Nixon in the same areas that either could have borrowed confidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hatchet man in the campaign ( " I say the things that he ca n't say " ) , Mr. Laird embarrassed his leader on more than one occasion , but their continued rapport suggests that it was clone to order and supports the assumption , valid on other grounds , that Secretary Laird will be the new President 's aggressive but obedient servant at the Pentagon . Banker David Kennedy of Chicago , no kin to the Kennedys , would have been a welcome addition to the John Kennedy Cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury , his assignment for Mr. Nixon , and he is known among money men here and abroad as an impressively able though conservative fellow with an active social conscience . California 's Lt. Governor Robert Finch , who by virtue of his departmental job ( Health , Education , and Welfare ) is , after the President-elect , the keeper-inchief of the Nixon Administration 's social conscience . He ' is a liberal by comparison ? but only by comparison ? with Governor Ronald Reagan . Finch , like the prospective Secretary of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in addition , a former assistant who will be just that , on a grand and possibly constructive scale , in the new Administration . If the foregoing seems uncharitable ( and it is in a way ) Mr. Nixon 's choice of an Attorney General justified our basic doubt that his Administration will be as alive to the deepest needs of this country as he believably says he wants it to be . John Mitchell is a partner in the Nixon law firm , he managed the Nixon campaign , and he conceived and delivered the disgraceful assurances to Southern Republicans that guaranteed Mr. Nixon 's nomination on the first ballot at Miami Beach . If his view of the federal role and of constitutional requirements prevails ? and it may not , the circumstances and pressures around the country being what they are ? the federal power will be used to the minimum to further social justice , and to the maximum to further " law and order " in its simplest and insufficient meaning . Mr. Nixon said in presenting Mr. Mitchell to the nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , one who recognizes the necessity to assure justice as well as law and order . " That will take some proving , by Attorney General Mitchell and by Richard Nixon . Boston Pot Party Only three remotely scientific studies of the physiological and psychological effects of marijuana have been reported in the United States , the most recent of them 22 years ago . Thirty-four soldiers in the Canal Zone were given marijuana in the early 1930 's ; they were seen to have improved appetites , some loss of inhibitions , higher pulse rates , drowsiness , but no impairment of ability to perform psychological and neurological tests . A second study , done for the famous LaGuardia Report in 1944 , involved 72 prisoners , more than half of whom were " users . " That experiment found in subjects a loss of steadiness , impaired intellectual functioning , feelings of relaxation , self-confidence , loss of inhibition , and no personality change . In 1946 the effects of smoking marijuana were studied in a group of prison subjects who were " chronic " users . Subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became listless and indifferent and lost some ability to perform in tests of concentration and manual dexterity . The experiments ? all poorly controlled ( the Canal Zone study did not report the type or dosage of marijuana used ) ? can be confirmed anecdotally by thousands of potential felons who have made smoking pot part of their daily routine . Certainly the studies are a shabby basis for the thirty-year " information " program of the late Narcotics Bureau and for the skein of laws proscribing marijuana . While traffic in drugs ? especially this one ? increases despite it all , medical science has been discouraged from learning what it can about the flowering tops of the hemp plant . Now , Science magazine , in its December 13 issue , reports the first new marijuana research since 1946 and apparently the first , controlled clinical work done in the US . The research , sponsored by the Boston University Medical Center , involved 17 subjects who were given marijuana to smoke in the laboratory , supplied through the courtesy of the Narcotics Bureau . Dosage was controlled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and comparisons were made of effects on users and persons who had not smoked pot before . The scientists , Dr. Andrew T. Weil , now of Mt . Zion Hospital in San Francisco ; Dr. Norman E. Zinberg , of Harvard ; and Miss Judith M. Delsen , of the Boston University School of Medicine ? have by their own account improved on the methodology of all previous experiments . Their findings in the main are consistent with their summary of earlier investigations . They found , for instance , a moderate increase in heart rate , eye redness , etc. , but somewhat surprisingly no change in pupil size or in blood sugar levels ( to account for appetite stimulation ) . Reactions differed in chronic users and so-called " na ? ve " subjects , the " heads " getting " high " more readily while the " straights " had less intense subjective experiences ( although they showed impaired performance on simple intellectual and motor tests ) . The physiological and psychological effects of one inhaled dose of marijuana reached maximum intensity within a half hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hours . While pot heads may legitimately ask " So what else is new ? " the study may have a pacifying influence on parents and officials who fear the drug on the basis of unsubstantiated horror stories . According to the Science report " no adverse marijuana reactions occurred in any of our subjects . " The study confirms some common assumptions and dispels others . Pupil dilation is probably in response to candlelight at pot parties , not to the drug itself . Nonusers do not have the same intense " high " as chronic users , apparently either because they expect too much from the experience , or because of some kind of " pharmacological sensitization " that requires several experiences to assert itself , or because suggestion plays a part in getting high . Chronic users perform as well or better on some tests than they do without the drug , thus leading to the suspicion that " maintaining effective levels of performance for many tasks ? driving for example ? is much easier under the influence of marijuana than under that of other psychoactive drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user a false sense of improved functioning . The Boston study provides the basis for a " longitudinal " study of marijuana smokers , occasional followup research designed to learn whether the longterm use of marijuana , like the long-term use of tobacco , has any adverse effects . There is currently , in the scientific literature , no study to indicate that it does or does not .
