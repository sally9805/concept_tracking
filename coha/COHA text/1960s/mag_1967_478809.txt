People who live on the Eastern Seaboard are likely to think that the National Singles Championships which are held early in September at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills , New York , chop off the official tennis season the way the World Series chops off baseball . They come after a series of tournaments during the summer that has included among others the French championships at the Racing Club in Paris , the English championships at Wimbledon , and a series of tournaments in Newport . Southampton , and the national doubles at Longwood . But for the players who lead the world in " amateur tennis " Forest Hills represents only a major , though not the major , stop in their rounds . Tournaments that engage the best tennis talent in the world happen all year long ? in Asia , Africa , South America , Australia , and both indoors and outdoors here in this country . Like most tennis enthusiasts I play more than I watch , but I have often wondered how a tournament like the Nationals is run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referee of the tournament this year and the new treasurer of the United States Lawn Tennis Association , to escort me behind the scenes , which he enthusiastically and efficiently did . On the second day of the tournament I was standing in the marquee at the Stadium with Mr. Davies when John Newcombe came in to play his first-round match . Newcombe had won Wimbledon earlier in the season , and he was seeded number one at Forest Hills . Mr. Davies introduced us . " How 's your back ? " I asked . " I hear it 's been giving you trouble . " " No , " he said in Australian , " it 's Harper 's ' WTImine , December 1967 my leg . It 's a pinched nerve in my back , but it 's my leg that bothered me . " He rubbed his right thigh . " Is it all right now ? " Mr. Davies asked . " I had a hit this morning , " Newcombe said , " and I did n't fee/ a thing . " After Newcombe went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You look puzzled . He had a hit does n't mean that he got bit . It 's the Australian way of saying that he had a rally with someone to warm up . " Mr. Davies , who is a real-estate man , a two-star general in the Air Force Reserve , and a member of the Landmarks Preservation Commission in New York , used to play tennis well enough to take part in national championships . Now in his early fifties , he is one of the large , enthusiastic crowd that makes the tournament at Forest Hills work . " It takes more than four hundred people to put this show on , " he said . These four hundred do not include the players . There are one hundred and twenty-one committee members , all of whom belong to the West Side Tennis Club , comprising twelve committees which , in a manner of speaking , grease the skids so that the players slide into the right slots at the right times with the right equipment . There are , Mr. Davies told me , " about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys . " It takes twenty men with rollers , line markers , sod tampers , and other gadgets to take care of the finely cut turf of the courts , and there are security guards and ushers and ticket takers . These are the only professionals ; the tournament is rather more amateur in the membership of its operators than of its players , though it is heresy to say so . " We start getting ready for next year 's tournament , " Mr. Davies explained , " the minute this one is over . Let me show you what goes on here in the marquee . " The marquee , a long yellow and blue striped tent that closes the horseshoe of the Stadium , is the nerve center of the tournament , and the brain in charge of the nervous system is the Referee . This year it was Mr. Dan Johnson , a large man with a square face , white hair , and an air of quiet authority . " Once the first ball is hit , " Mr. Davies explained , " all decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player should be disqualified , for example . if he does n't turn up precisely on time for his scheduled match . He determines which matches will be played in the Stadium , which on the " Grandstand " court , the " Fieldstand " court , or the Field courts , of which there are thirteen , all continually busy in the early rounds of the tournament . " You realize , " Mr. Davies said , " that this is n't just one tournament ; it 's five tournaments ? in addition to the men 's singles , there 's women 's singles , men thirty-five to forty-five , senior men 's , forty-five and older , and senior women 's . " Behind the front row of boxes ( in which seats for the full eleven days of the tournament cost . $100 ) the marquee is divided into segments by wooden railings . One segment is the Referee 's headquarters , where there is a battery of telephones with a couple of volunteers to man them . These phones are connected with the " Sun Deck " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just about as far away as one can get and still be at the West Side Tennis Club . It is to the Sun Deck that the male players report to find out when their matches are scheduled and on what courts . Another phone connects with the women 's locker room , from which female contestants are dispatched . Mr. Johnson said to me , " If there are any questions I can answer , do n't hesitate to ask me . " I suggested that he must be a pretty busy man , and he replied , " It 's like being the captain of a ship . It takes a lot to get . it away from the pier and a lot to get it landed , but it pretty much runs on its own once it gets going . " Next to the Referee 's pen is another about the same size from which umpires and linesmen , who sit in still another pen next . to it , are dispatched to the courts on which they are to serve . The umpire is provided with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet longs with the names of the contestants of the match , one set for the master scoreboard just outside the marquee and one for the court where the match is played . " Where do you get the umpires and linesmen ? " I asked Mr. Davies . AFTER HOURS " No problem , " he said , " they come from all over , from as far as the West Coast . They come for the honor of it and for the love of the game . They get nothing . They pay their own way ; they pay their own hotel bills . They 're recommended by their regional associations / of the United States Lawn Tennis Association who qualify them . I say they get nothing . They get a few free drinks and an occasional free meal , and , of course , they get abuse from the spectators from morning to night . " " What about the ball boys ? " I asked . " You know , " he said , " all that 's changed . It used to be considered an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids clamored to be allowed to do it . They came from tennis clubs , sons of members , from private schools , from all over . Now we have to beat the bushes for them and we pay them eighty cents an hour . It takes a good many months to train them . Perhaps you 'd like to see how the operation at the Sun Deck at the club works . " The terrace of the clubhouse , a sort of 1910 Tudor mansion , was crowded . Famous tennis faces , looking rather older than one remembered them , were engaged in earnest conversation ; girls in tennis dresses ( the miniskirt is at home on a tennis court ) gazed up at young men in tennis clothes carrying sheafs of rackets . It was any clubhouse during tournament week only a little more so . The Sun Deck opens out of a second-floor room with a bar where a group of men waiting to play their matches and a few old-timers were watching a baseball game on television . On the Sun Deck behind a green railing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses . " It 's five-three in the third set on twelve , " one of the men said . " They ought to be off there in a few minutes . " Mr. Davies introduced me to Mr. DeWitt Davis , who was in charge of the Sun Deck operatioas . Behind Mr. Davis was a large white-board on which was written " Order of Play " with black crayon and below it hastily printed pairs of names and court numbers . Matches that had been completed that day were crossed out with a large X , and in the upper right of the board was the legend : PLAYERS BE READY TO PLAY EARLY TODAY . HEAVY SCHEDULE . Next to the clubhouse wall was a counter with four or five phones on it , connecting with the marquee , with the men 's and women 's locker room , with the umpires ' and linesmen 's booth and the pen where the ball boys are corralled next to the Stadium . " The remarkable thing about this tournament , " Mr. Davis said , " is that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act as much like professionals as we do . What would you like to know ? " " I 'd just like to watch , " I said . " Help yourself , " he said . He introduced me to a young man dressed and ready to play , who was leaning against the parapet . He said I was from Harper 's and the young man smiled and said , " I 'm a tennis bum . " Ile was Clark Graebner , the only United States player who was seeded in the men 's singles and , as it turned out , the second American to reach the finals at Forest Hills since Tony Trabert won it in 1955 . By chance I had met the finalists of the tournament within a few minutes . " Perhaps you 'd like this , " Mr. Davis said and gave me several dittoed sheets from a loose-leaf notebook . They were headed " Sun Deck Operations " : " . . . keeping matches going smoothly and following one another quickly on twenty or so courts at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscientious effort and the application of persistent ingenuity . .. " There followed specific instructions which would seem to cover every possible exigency ? missing players , missing water jugs , missing ball boys , what to do if " during play on the field courts . . . the crowds are getting out of hand " ( answer : " the admissions committee should be notified " ) ? but there are things that can not be anticipated that require " persistent ingenuity . " There were , after all , 229 players signed up for the several tournaments ( the largest number , 128 , was for the men 's singles ; 78 women played in the women 's singles ) , which means approximately 110 matches or better than a hundred scheduled opportunities for miscalculation , misunderstanding , or mishap . Mr. Davis and his cohorts on the operations committee seemed cool in the face of these possibilities . AFTER HOURS " The tournament at Wimbledon , " Mr. Davis said , " is run by professionals . " I did n't have an opportunity to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I discovered that there is a wistfulness bordering on envy at Forest Hills not only about the prestige of Wimbledon but , more importantly , about how it manages to be a **29;2283;TOOLONG proposition every single day of the tournament . At Forest Hills the only complete sale of all 12,246 seats in the Stadium happens , if it happens at all , on the day of the finals ; during the early days of the tournament a good crowd is about half that number . The weather for the tournament this year was almost perfect ? bright skies free of smog , enough breeze to wave the flags on the upper rim of the Stadium but not enough to bother the players , and pleasantly cool . The rainy summer had been kind to the turf of the courts , though even when they have got a bit brown , it is possible to " green them up with top dressing in a couple of days , " according to Mr. Henry Benisch , the president of the club with whom I watched part of a match from the marquee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during tournament week , and put in much more time talking with the men who were greasing the wheels than in watching tennis . I made an attempt to talk with the woman in charge of " player hospitality , " but the public-relations people , who are hired professionals , had thrown up some sort of smoke screen around her which did n't seem worth circumventing . I did get a list of the activities planned for the players ; they did not lack for entertainment or hospitality when their day 's work was done . My pleasantest , and in some respects most instructive , afternoon at the tournament was on the day of the " round of sixteen " ? the fourth round , that is , just before the quarter finals . There was a show between Stadium matches of tennis fashions for women in which , I am fairly sure , no self-respecting tennis players would be caught dead . ( " It happens every year , " one of the more prominent officials said , " and it gets worse every year . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't get it . " ) When the girls in their pink ( sic ) sneakers got off the center courts with their pink ( sic ) rackets , Mr. Davies sat me down under an awning at the end of the marquee just below the loudspeaker control booth , and brought several of his friends who were serving in official capacities to fill me in . The match in progress was between Rafael Osuna , the Mexican who was champion in 1963 , and the Australian , Owen Davidson , who was going to become the new tennis " pro " at Wimbledon this autumn . No one whom I saw in the tournament played with the style , deftness of touch , and good humor of Osuna , though Davidson beat him in five sets . Through two of the sets Werner C. Bruchlos , a member of the Operations Committee who that day was in charge of the marquee operations , sat with me . He is the president of the company that publishes The American Banker magazine . ( He told me that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were used by a number of the tournament players , though he already has nine rackets in his locker . I would guess that Mr. Bruchlos is in his middle sixties . ) " It 's up to our committee to get the players on the courts . You have to keep one eye on each player , " he said ; " they vanish in the wink of an eye . We have to see that they have towels , a water cooler , salt tablets , orange juice , and Coke . Osuna always wants chocolate bars at the last minute , for that last-minute bit of energy . I do n't know why he ca n't remember to get his own . " He laughed affectionately ; it was quite apparent that Osuna was a player of whom he was fond . " You have to be sure that the buys have a change of clothes and that they report on time . Between the third and fourth sets if the players want to rest and change they have to be back on the court exactly ten minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manfredi , in charge of the Medical Service Committee , told me that his regular job is physician to the athletes at Columbia University . We almost had a delivery in the Stadium the other day , " he said , " a seven-months pregnancy . We 're pretty well equipped for almost anything . " There is another physician beside himself and a nurse on hand during the tournament and a medical " tent " which , he explained , is a room under the Stadium . " Players come for shots , for strapping , for supports , and , of course , for tennis elbow . We have a pretty good system for treating tennis elbow . We also treat the committeemen , and two bartenders came in yesterday with cuts on their hands . " I asked about the men who play in the senior tournament , the old boys over forty-five , and I referred to them as the " heart-attack squad . " " For a number of years , " he said , " I 've advocated getting cardiograms with the applications for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Also , I asked about the spectators . " I 've never seen tennis fans intoxicated , " he said . " They 're a very moderate crowd . People occasionally get sick in the stands but not , from drink . " Tennis has a reputation for being a " gentleman 's game , " and someone , I am told , who was commenting on the finals of the tournament over television , said that it has a reputation for being snobbish ; this raises several interesting questions . Only in Australia has tennis achieved the stature of a national sport , and more there than anywhere tennis champions are national heroes . Unquestionably the climate has something to do with this : tennis there can be played al year round and potential champions can ( and evidently do ) think of little else . I asked Mr , Davies if one of the famous former winners of the Nationals , an Australian , was an interesting fellow , and he replied , " Interesting ? Well , he does n't know about anything or care about anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to remember how recent-1y golf was considered a snobbish game that only the rich had time and money to play ; public courses were extremely rare , and there were always more caddies in the caddy house than players who needed them . A similar declassing of tennis is , Mr. Davies assured me , taking place . There are many more schools with tennis teams than there used to be . The USLTA has a vigorous " juniordevelopment program " operating on a nationwide basis in which tennis professionals are teaching thousands of youngsters . There are many more tennis clubs than there used to be . But in my estimation one of the strongest opponents of democratizing tennis is the shadowy line that separates the amateur player from the professional . In a very real sense the best players on the world circuit of amateur tournaments are on the equivalent of salaries ; they make their livings , and their families ' livings , with their rackets . They are supported by tennis associations and by participation in tournaments . Those who are consistent winners as amateurs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather trumped-up ( it seems to me ) professional tournaments . Everyone knows that amateurism in topflight tennis is a sham , and nearly everyone would like to do something about it . The first step is to do what golf has long done ? hold open tournaments . " We 're all for it , " one of the officials at Forest Hills said when I asked him what he thought . " England and France and Australia and so on are all for it . It 's the Iron Curtain countries and the small countries that vote it down every year . " ' " 1 ' The real amateurs at Forest Hills were not the players ( though some , of course , were ) but the men and women who put on the show , kept it going smoothly , and because they love the game give up their jobs ( temporarily ) or their vacations to run this complicated business operation . All around the globe this winter and during the spring there will be similar groups of men and women working doggedly at similar problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly hooked a man will not let him go . *The players at the Nationals , for example , are put up in a good New York hotel at the expense of the tournament and are given lunch in their own special tent each day at the Club . " Since this article was written , the British Lawn Tennis Association announced on October 5 , 1967 , that professionals will be invited to participate in the Wimbledon tournament in 1968 , a brave step in the right direction , and one that is likely to break the tradition of what the British call " shamateurism.
