A DECEPTIVE atmosphere pervades Washington whenever one Administration gives way to another . Power seems to ebb steadily until the incumbents appear to be little more than caretakers . Yet , until Jan. 20 , Johnson and his lieutenants retain considerable authority . By exercising it , the Democrats can create commitments-and problems - that will affect Richard Nixon for months or perhaps years to come . <P> Since November , foreign-policy decisions have been subject to formal consultation between the old leaders and the new . On the domestic side , however , there has been some effort to create " plenty of momentum , " as one Administration aide put it , to keep Great Society programs thriving . <P> Fundamental Change . Last week the Department of Housing and Urban Development gave the first operating grant - $19 million to Seattle-under the Model Cities program , which was enacted in 1966 . Twenty other grants are anticipated this month . Similarly , the Labor and Defense Departments last month expanded their Concentrated Employment Program , which trains jobless men for posts on military installations . On all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conduct a full review . <P> At Health , Education and Welfare , Secretary Wilbur Cohen recently began a fundamental and potentially far-reaching change in federal policy governing the eligibility of relief recipients . At present , some potential recipients must undergo investigations of need that often prove demeaning . Under Cohen 's proposed ruling , eligibility would be established on the basis of the applicant 's own declaration . Twenty-seven states already use this controversial practice , usually relying on spot checks to discourage fraudulent declarations . Cohen has not yet issued a formal ruling to make the system nationwide , but he is likely to do so-and that would pose a serious problem for his successor , Robert Finch . If Finch were to reverse the ruling , he would surely enrage the liberals who have been arguing for the change for years . If he were to enforce it , he would anger critics of the welfare program who believe that the change would only encourage widespread fraud . <P> Northern Issue . Another problem concerns the enforcement of school desegregation . Until recently , Washington has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South , withholding federal subsidies from 113 of them for failure to comply with HEW guidelines . Now the Government is considering similar action against one school district in Middletown , Ohio , and another in Union Township , N.J. , both of which stand to lose their subsidies if they do not meet federal integration requirements . At present , HEW has 63 investigators in the South and only 40 in the rest of the country . By mid-January , the number outside the South will be increased to 68 ; investigations in nearly 40 Northern jurisdictions are under way . The entire issue of desegregation guidelines will be an extremely touchy one for Nixon , who was elected with strong support from the white suburbs yet would like to improve his low standing among Negroes.
