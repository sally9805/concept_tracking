Sixteen months ago , gun in hand , Fidel Castro came out of the Sierra Maestra range in eastern Cuba and liberated the island from dictatorship . Last week , gun in hand , Castro returned to the Sierra . This time he was the hunter . <P> The prey was Captain Manuel Beatn , one of the growing number of officers in Castro 's army who think that Communists have perverted and appropriated Castro 's revolution . Beatn popped up on the Sierra 's southern slope a fortnight ago , leading a band of 60 to 80 men . He reached an army garrison , captured arms . <P> To smash him , Castro sent a small combined unit of militia and regulars under the command of a major . Instead , Beatn killed the major . Out from Havana on the run hurried an alarmed Fidel with his army chief , Juan Almeida , and his Armed Forces Minister , Brother Ral , at his side . Pelted by spring rains , they slogged last week through calf-deep red mud seeking out the new rebel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
