Viewing the permanent marriage crisis in Hollywood , the late Robert Benchley took the position that , like cinematography itself , the whole thing is an illusion ; there really are no more divorces among film stars than among dentists , only more publicity . But , faced with never-ending divorce bulletins from Hollywood , puritans are certain that actors , unlike decent people , have the morals of hamsters . Cynics feel that actors-like hamsters-have the same unsteady morals as decent people , differ merely in having too much time , money and inclination . Psychologists set forth that anyone who becomes an actor in the first place must be a narcissist , yearning for ever-new romantic mirrors to provide adoration . Whatever the truth , from Hollywood last week the sound of distant sundering was louder than usual . <P> Red-haired Lucille Ball , 48 , who had once said of her 19-year-long marriage that she " never expected it to last six weeks , " divorced Desi Arnaz , 43 , calling the last few years a " nightmare " during which Desi became hysterically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beverly Hills mansion or when he could not find a jacket he wanted to wear . The split : for Lucy , their two children , half of their $20 million Desilu TV interests , the leaky mansion , two station wagons , a cemetery plot at Forest Lawn . For Desi : the other half of the $20 million , a golf cart , a membership in a Palm Springs country club , a truck , several horses . <P> Lank Model Suzy Parker , 27 , a redhead whose peculiar talent is to make bones look even more appealing than flesh , finally conceded that , after almost five years with Paris Reporter Pierre de la Salle ( one child ) , it was all over . Some months ago , Suzy had given an interesting description of her marriage : " An American girl is against everything a Frenchman stands for . I 've been told I ca n't cook , I ca n't sew , and I 'm not fit to be a wife . If I speak French to him , he speaks English . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak French . It 's O.K. ; I 'm playing along with the game , and when the right moment comes I 'll let him have it right between the eyes . " <P> Terrible-tempered Bette Davis , 52 , charged her fourth husband , dour Actor Gary Merrill , 44 , with extreme cruelty , asked for alimony , will have a new co-star when she takes The World of Carl Sandburg to Broadway in September . <P> At an acrimonious custody hearing , Anna Kashfi turned on her ex-husband , Marlon Brando , and sneered . " You slob . " <P> TV Actor Efrem . Zimbalist Jr. , star of 77 Sunset Strip , left home and , the knowing say , will seek a divorce . The trouble : his wife , Stephanie Spalding , likes horses and he does n't . Also , he likes Starlet Kipp Hamilton and she , naturally , doesn't.
