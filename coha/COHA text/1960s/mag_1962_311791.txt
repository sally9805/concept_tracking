" There was once a town in the heart of America where all life seemed to be in harmony with its surroundings . " It had fertile farms , prosperous farmers , birds in the trees , fish in the streams , and flowers blooming gaily along the roadsides . Then a white powder fell from the sky like snow , and a fearful blight crept over the land . Cattle and sheep sickened ; hens could not hatch their eggs . Strange illnesses appeared among the people ; children were stricken at play and died within a few hours . The birds sang no more , the fish in the streams died , and the roadsides were lined with browned vegetation as if swept by fire . <P> Such is the picture drawn of the future in Silent Spring , a new book by Rachel Carson , whose The Sea Around Us earned her a reputation not only as a competent marine biologist but as a graceful writer . Miss Carson 's deadly white powder is not radioactive fallout , as many readers will at first assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against which Miss Carson has taken up her pen in alarm and anger , putting literary skill second to the task of frightening and arousing her readers . Published this week , the book has already raised a swirl of controversy about the danger to man and wildlife of those modern chemical compounds that have vastly increased agricultural production , banished some diseases , and kept at bay the most bothersome and harmful of insects and rodents . <P> As Miss Carson sees it , the accomplishments are not worth the price . She explains that no single town has suffered all the misfortunes from spraying and dusting that she describes ; " yet every one of these disasters has actually happened somewhere , and many real communities have already suffered a substantial number of them . A grim specter has crept upon us , and this imagined tragedy may easily become a stark reality . ' ' <P> As Bad as the Borgias . The bulk of Miss Carson 's book is support for this nightmare curtain raiser . In a chapter titled " Elixirs of Death , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into use at the end of World War II . All of them are dangerous , she says without reservation . Already they are everywhere : in soil , rivers , ground water , even in the bodies of living animals and humans . " They occur in mother 's milk . " she says , using emotion-fanning words , " and probably in the tissues of the unborn child . " And worse is to come . " This birth-to-death contact , " she warns , " contributes to the progressive buildup of chemicals in our bodies and so to cumulative poisoning . We are in little better position than the guests of the Borgias . " <P> There is no doubt about the impact of Silent Spring ; it is a real shocker . Many unwary readers will be firmly convinced that most of the U.S.-with its animals , plants , soil , water and people-is already laced with poison that will soon start taking a dreadful toll , and that the only hope is to stop using chemical pesticides and let the age-old " balance of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
