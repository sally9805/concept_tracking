Into the Senate committee hearing room came a wan blonde . Her hair was done up in a sort of beehive style . Her name was Gertrude Novak , and she was a $7,385-a-year clerk of the Senate Small Business Committee . Appearing last week before the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration as the first public-hearing witness on the affairs of Bobby Baker , former secretary to the Democratic Senate Majority , she told a story of stock ventures and mortgages that would have baffled brighter-looking blondes . <P> She recalled how her husband had given Baker $12,000 in February 1960 to buy 3,600 shares of stock in Milwaukee 's Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corp. , then split a $54,000 profit with Baker 13 months later . Wisconsin 's Republican Representative John W. Byrnes was another who bought that stock ; his 100 shares , for which he paid $2,300 , are now worth around $24,000 . Byrnes , who had helped Mortgage Guaranty get a tax-relief ruling from the Internal Revenue Service , insisted that the stock deal was not a conflict of interest . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits to charity . <P> The Mortgage Guaranty stock profit was about the only pleasant memory Trudy Novak could muster . The Novaks , she said , lost every penny of a $107,000 investment in Baker 's Carousel motel in Ocean City , Md. , when Baker sold out at a loss . A $15,000 investment in a Baker-suggested electronics stock was nearly wiped out when the price fell . Then , 21 months ago , Alfred Novak was found dead in the garage at his home ; the District of Columbia coroner ruled the death a suicide . <P> What Trudy Novak seemed to remember most vividly was the way Bobby Baker tossed bundles of money about like so much laundry . Frequently , she said , she would stop by Baker 's Capitol office to pick up sizable sums for the Carousel 's operating expenses . It was always in cash . Once , she said , she found his desk stacked with nearly $15,000 in $100 bills . Baker himself rushed off to the Senate floor , leaving Trudy and his secretary to count out $13,300 for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mr. Baker , " she said , " in that he was handling that much cold cash . " <P> Most of what Witness Novak had to say was already public knowledge ( TIME , Nov. 8 ) . But her appearance did accomplish one thing : it at least generated some sort of start to the hearings - after eight weeks of shilly-shallying by a Senate committee all too obviously reluctant to undertake an investigation that might hit close to home .
