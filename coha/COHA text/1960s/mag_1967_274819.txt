A Louder Voice for Laymen <P> Roman Catholic education in the U.S. was in the midst of a full-fledged upheaval last week . College after college an- nounced that it was opening up its board of trustees to laymen . Jesuit-run St. Louis University , up to now governed by 13 priests of the order , said that it will shift to a board on which laymen will have an 18 to 10 majority . Father Paul C. Reinert will step aside as board chairman-to be replaced by Daniel L. Schlafly , a layman . Chicago 's Loyola University said that for the first time in its 97-year history laymen will be named as trustees . Still another Jesuit School , the University of Detroit , will turn over half the seats on a new 16-man trustee board to the laity . <P> Other Catholic schools have similar plans . Last week the Congregation of Holy Cross , which operates the University of Notre Dame , reorganized the school 's governing board ; under the new setup the six priests who currently make up the board will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holy Cross Fathers approved another mixed lay-clerical board for the University of Portland , which they also control . Cleveland 's John Carroll University is working along the same lines , and New York 's Fordham University , which has been experimentally allowing its 36-member lay board of advisers to vote on school matters along with its eight Jesuit trustees , may well make the practice permanent . <P> The transfer of power symbolizes not only the increasing role that laymen now play in the administration of many Catholic universities , but also the postconciliar emphasis on their position in the church . For many schools , a contributing factor is a Maryland court decision last year declaring unconstitutional state aid to colleges that are totally religious in spirit and atmosphere . Fordham 's President Father Leo McLaughlin admitted as much last week . " In the not too distant future , " he said , " the Supreme Court will have to consider the question raised by the Maryland court , and , if that principle is upheld , changes will have to be made within the structure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and state aid . " Otherwise , he warned , many of them will have to close their doors .
