The Outrage , at best , is a 97-minute rehash of the vivid Japanese classic Rashomon . At worst , it is a clear case of Occidental death . In remaking Director Akira Kurosawa 's 1952 Oscar winner , the producers have added a bumper crop of cactus , presumably hoping to repeat the success of The Magnificent Seven , a western based on Kurosawa 's epic tale of the samurai . Assigned to this prickly task are Star Paul Newman , Director Martin Ritt and Photographer James Wong Howe , all covered with pay dirt from their triumphant collaboration in Hud . The result this time is a slick , shallow olio of rape , murder and violence . <P> Like the Japanese original , the American remake weaves four differing versions of a crime into a philosophical conundrum about the nature of truth . While waiting out a thunderstorm at a desolate western whistlestop , three men fall to reminiscing about all the sex and sinnin ' that came out at a badman 's trial for murder . Seems a Southern dandy ( Laurence Harvey ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a woodsy glen by a notorious Mexican bandit ( Newman ) , who bound the husband to a tree and then raped the wife . Later , the husband was found dead and the case came to trial . Whether he was killed in a fair fight , murdered by his dishonored wife , or done in by his own hand , depends on which of the protagonists ' testimonies can be believed . One of the trio gathered at the depot is a thieving old prospector ( Howard Da Silva ) , who finally admits that he was an eyewitness to the crime but claims that none of the stories told at the trial were wholly true . <P> Unfortunately , before the prospector relates his own near-farcical version of what happened , The Outrage has already set the audience snickering . Even Howe 's limpid , meticulous photography can not redeem the dialogue , which the actors often appear to be addressing to Destiny rather than to one another , perhaps out of kindness .

" And in the film 's bumbling climax , ironic tragedy turns to fatuity when Harvey belly-whoppers into a clump of sage , staggers to his feet , notes a bejeweled dagger protruding bloodlessly from his chest and announces coyly : " Ah tripped .
