Brazil has the world 's eighth largest population , the twelfth largest gross national product , and it takes up nearly half of South America ; yet Americans as a whole know little of this huge nation 's origins and history , its culture and personality . Out of admiration as much as acumen , Publisher Alfred A. Knopf has filled the gap by publishing two volumes of the classic social history of Brazil written by Gilberto Freyre , 63 , Brazil 's great scholar . <P> <P> The first volume , written in 1933 and translated into English in 1946 , dealt with the Portuguese colonization and the establishment of Negro slavery on the coffee and sugar plantations . Freyre 's second volume , written in 1936 , has now been translated by Harriet de Onis , mother of the New York Times 's Brazil cor respondent . Titled The Mansions and the Shanties ( Knopf ; $10 ) , the book traces the growth of the cities in the 19th century and the breakdown of slavery ( formally abolished in 1888 ) , and cheerfully argues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miscegenation . " Perhaps in no other country , " writes Freyre , " is it possible to rise so quickly from one social class to another , from one race to another , from one region to another . " <P> Freedom from Father . In the Brazil of the early 1800 's , the wealthy whites , who lived in mansions with their families and slaves , were completely segregated from the free Negroes , who lived in shanties . The mansions dominated the cities . Owners ventured as little as possible from their homes , which were much like richly furnished prisons . Their wives and daughters lived in secluded rooms without win dows and glimpsed the outside world only through shutters and grilles , " which separated the home from the street as though from an enemy . " <P> But the British , who came to exploit the rich Brazilian market , broke down many of the social barriers . They " unshadowed " Brazil , leaving it open , plain and more English . Shutters were replaced by glass windows ; verandas were built so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . The streets were paved , lighted , and generally " emancipated " from the wealthy . <P> This new " Europeanization " also liberated Brazil 's sons , who in patriarchal Brazil had been completely at the mercy of their tyrannical fathers . Under the influence of European liberalism , they rebelled and deserted family business for the law or the arts . They were even determined to look as little as possible like their hearty fathers . They cultivated ill health and the appearance , writes Freyre , of the " conventional Jesus of the Crucifixion . " It became the fashion to die young . " To die old was for the bourgeoisie , for the rich planters , for the obese vicars , for the favorite plantation slaves . ' Geniuses ' died young and , if possible , of tuberculosis .
