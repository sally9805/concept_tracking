When Mrs. Thomas A. Taylor went out to weed her garden in Alexandria , Va. , one recent morning , she found everything swarming with strange-looking insects . <P> Some were crawling out of their shells . <P> They were making a noise that sounded like a rusty saw in a hickory log. * The creatures tiptoeing through Mrs. <P> Taylor 's tulips were the vanguard of the 1962 class of the periodical cicada-more popularly known as the 17-year locust . Her swarm was the forerunner of a wave called " Brood II , " which will soon take over most of the Eastern seaboard from North Carolina to Connecticut . According to Dr. B. A. Porter , entomologist at the Plant Industry Station in Beltsville , Md. , the 1962 plague should be in full swing ( and cry ) by the end of May , should taper off about the first of July . <P> American cicadas have a long and well-documented history ( those were grasshoppers , not cicadas , in Biblical plagues ) . <P> Actually , there are two Fine Old Families amongst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted in Connecticut in 1724 , fourteen hatches ago ; Brood X was first recorded in 1715 . This explains why gardeners , who do n't know about the broods , will be puzzled to find another visitation this year , when the last-they remember distinctly-was only nine years ago in 1953 . That was Brood X. To complicate things further , there are Southern branches of the cicada family that appear every 13 years , and in some unfortunate areas , the 17-and the 13-year tribes overlap , sometimes hit exactly the same hatching years . <P> The most noticeable damage done by cicadas is to young fruit trees , and may take months or years to become evident . <P> The trouble comes when the female lays her eggs . She picks a tender twig , saws a slit in it with a rasplike ovipositor on her stern , lays her eggs in the slit , and soon dies . The weakened limbs may break or die too . After several weeks the eggs hatch , the larvae crawl out and drop down on the ground where they bury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the first hot day of May , they climb out of the ground , shed their shells , sprout wings and start a plague . <P> Are 17-year locusts any good to anybody ? Dr. Leland Howard , a pioneer entomologist , decided in 1885 that they might be good to eat . His report : when broiled they are flabby-nothing but skin ; most palatable method is to fry them in batter , when they remind one of shrimps . <P> But , he concluded : " They will never prove a delicacy . " <P> * According to Department of Agriculture Leaflet No. 340 ( The Periodical Cicada ) , the noise goes : " Tsh-ee-EEEE-e-ou " ... or sometimes , " AH-O-oo. "
