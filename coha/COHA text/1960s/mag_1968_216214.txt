INSTANT REPLAY : THE GREEN BAY DIARY OF JERRY KRAMER . Edited by Dick Schaap. 286 pages . World . $5.95 . <P> <P> " We 've got to be whipped . We 've got to be cussed . ... He whipped us , but we needed whipping . " This is no simple disciple of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch talking , but a professional football player trying to attain the mystical condition of " upness " or " winning attitude , " which , according to American tradition , has to be artificially induced by alternate whippings and strokings from an older man . <P> <P> Jerry Kramer slaves for the Green Bay Packers-the football equivalent of the Radio City Rockettes-a group that habitually barters personal freedom for perfection . His tamer has been an emotional virtuoso named Vince Lombardi , a cross between the late General Patton and a good Italian mama : a raging , weeping computer who can get his players down on Tuesday , up on Wednesday , buried on Thursday and winning on Sunday , virtually at will . <P> Scared of Daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Replay is more or less the result . He shows that all was not beating and moaning in Lombardi 's bedlam . " Tomorrow , I imagine , Coach Lombardi 'll pat him on the head , rub his back , scratch his ears , and everybody 'll feel a little better , " he writes of one player . At other times , Coach leads his bulls in song . All very sincere , all very calculated . What makes the diary interesting is that the author knows exactly what is being done to him , chooses it , and even in some twisted way enjoys it . He describes Lombardi as primarily a child psychologist ; but perhaps athletes have to become as little children to win championships . For instance , one of the Packers , age 33 , finds himself concealing an ice-cream cone behind his back . Excellent attitude . The emotional regression will stand him in good stead on Sunday . Scared of Daddy , he is all the more likely to terrorize the rest of the block . <P> <P> Kramer has mixed feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk a lot about the money , as if that were motive enough . But Kramer knows better . What justifies it for him finally is the comradeship and sense of celebration when the pounding stops-the feeling Victorian families must have had at Christmastime . The charade ends with Daddy happy for the moment , and a new trophy on the shelf : an unprecedented third world championship mounted on a field of broken collarbones . This psychic manipulation complements the military planning of the Packer High Command . Kramer starts on Tuesday-by Thursday it is too late-working up " an anger , then a hatred , " to the point where on one occasion he considers kicking a fallen opponent in the spine . What kind of victory , what kind of money , justifies this corrupt make-believe is a problem he confesses is beyond him . <P> Dreams of Broadies . Yet the Packers come through as genial a bunch of sadomasochists as one could hope to meet . " Dr. " Willie Davis , so named because he " made the women feel so good " ; Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herd of broadies grazing on martinis " ; Bart Starr , the resident nice guy . The types , allowing weight for age , can be found in all the best schoolboy fiction .
