Well into 1967 , U.S. corporate leaders are still adding up very handsome figures for 1966 . Items : <P> &gt; Pan Am , which was spared the 43-day machinists ' strike , soared on full seats and heavy military charters . The strike did cost it a $12 million payment to rival TWA and the other four affected lines under a mutual aid pact , but profits nevertheless increased 61% to $84 million . Flying into 1967 , Pan Am got a big boost last month when it finally won permission as the only nondomestic carrier to fly its international passengers across the U.S. <P> &gt; Alcoa shrugged off the Administration 's price-hike rollback of October 1965 , came through 1966 with sales up 18% , profits up an astonishing 40% , to $106 million . Alcoa , the world 's largest aluminum producer , last month led the industry to a modest price increase , which President John D. Harper insists is necessary to give the ebullient industry one thing it lacks : " a more adequate return on invested capital . " <P> &gt; General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though its 1966 sales fell 6.8% behind 1965 's record . Dollar sales eased only 2.4% , but profits , beset by higher costs , slumped 16% to $1.8 billion . Ford , too , felt the chill : profits down 12% to $621 million despite record sales . Looking ahead , G.M. 's board gave 1967 a vote of confidence last week , maintained the company 's 85 quarterly stock dividend . <P> &gt;Anaconda prospered on high world copper prices and swelling U.S. demand . Through a nearly strike-free year , the company 's sales surged to ten figures ( $1.2 billion ) for the first time , while earnings swelled by 67% to $132 million . In the fourth quarter , profits rose 116% over the same period in 1965 . <P> &gt; U.S. Steel , which surprised Wall Street last fall by raising its dividend from 50 to 60 , was not being overconfident after all : even though the company 's profits slipped 11% to $249 million for all of 1966 , earnings rebounded 22% in the fourth quarter . " About what we expected , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign that the industry 's major sales problem-the big steel inventories built up by its customers during 1965-had about run its course . <P> &gt; Union Carbide , second only to Du Pont in chemicals , achieved its fifth straight record year , with profits up 2% to $231 million on sales of $2.2 billion , despite what Chairman Birny Mason Jr . called " adverse factors " - mostly strikes-which brought on a fourth-quarter squeeze . Mason 's continuing expansion program is moving Carbide close to Du Pont , whose 1966 earnings fell 5% to $389 million . <P> &gt;R . J. Reynolds , the No. 1 tobacco company , raised its 1966 earnings by 3.4% to a record $138 million-with a lot of help from sales of non-tobacco products ( Hawaiian Punch juice , Chun King foods ) . Despite the health furor , there is plenty of fire in the company 's smokes . Its Camels and Salems remained at the top of their markets , while Winston edged out American Tobacco 's Pall Mall for the first time as the best-selling brand of any kind .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
