The Red Guards have failed so far to make good their boast to export the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the rest of the world . But some signs of Mao Tse-tung 's new way of doing things have cropped up in Red China 's embassies abroad . Soon after he unleashed his teen-age zealots in Peking , Mao dispatched an order to his diplomats : act in a proletarian way , do your own dishes , tend your own garden , wear simple clothing , be frugal . <P> Obeying orders , Chinese diplomats have put aside Western suits for Mao-type tunics . The wife of the ambassador to Morocco has just returned from Peking with the new look for diplomats ' wives - short bobbed hair and pantaloons . Embassy libraries have been stripped of non-Mao books . The Red Chinese embassy in Bern has put away such art treasures as the horse statuette from the Tang period , which once was proudly shown to Swiss visitors as a masterpiece of Chinese culture . In the trade exposition in Algiers , guests now are confronted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revolution . This Way Out . " Embassy staffers in Cairo replaced statues of Venus and other classical figures with a huge photo of Mao . <P> Out of the Swim . Mao 's orders have made the Chinese diplomats more standoffish than ever . When the Cultural Revolution was announced , China 's new ambassador to Algeria , Tseng Tao , had just begun to relish swimming at Algiers ' spacious El-Kettani Club , a meeting place for the country 's elite . Now he is seldom seen outside his for bidding embassy . Actually , Peking 's emissaries are so isolated that they have little to do . But there was a flurry of activity in the Moscow embassy last week . In the latest round in the Sino-Soviet controversy , the Kremlin announced that all remaining Red Chinese students - estimated at 65-must be out of the country by month 's end . <P> Guests at last week 's National Day receptions were struck by the difference from previous celebrations . Instead of the Scotch and gin of yesteryear , only Chinese rice wine was served at most places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maw-tai . <P> The few diplomats abroad who converse with foreigners seem less than enthusiastic about the Cultural Revolution , privately blame the excesses of the Red Guards for bringing Peking a bad press throughout the world . Publicly they keep a discreet silence . After all , just by living abroad the diplomats have made themselves logical targets for the xenophobic Red Guards when-and if - they return home .
