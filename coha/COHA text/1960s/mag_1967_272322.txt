When Wilt Chamberlain was with the San Francisco Warriors , local sportswriters tended to regard him as an oversized goon who could dunk the ball but rated zero on team play . WILT SCORES 50 , WARRIORS LOSE , the headlines often read . The crowds were down on him , too . " I ca n't love a 7-ft. 1-in. loser , " said a fan at the time . So two years ago , San Francisco gladly traded Wilt to the Philadelphia 76ers . Last year the Warriors fired Wilt 's coach , Alex Hannum , after a front-office squabble , and he also wound up in Philadelphia . Good riddance ? Undeniably-for Chamberlain and Hannum . <P> Last week the two old Warriors led the 76ers against San Francisco in the finals of the National Basketball Association championships . And revenge , ah , it was sweet . Not that it was easy . The 76ers won the first two games of the best-of-seven series , but the Warriors ' big gun now is Rick Barry , 23 . Scoring 55 points in one game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two victories in the next three games , and returned home trailing by only three games to two . <P> Yet there , in the sixth game , it ended . The Wilt Chamberlain of the 1966-67 season is a complete ballplayer-no longer concentrating on scores for the record book , instead setting up plays for teammates , scrambling downcourt to fight for rebounds and break up Warrior attack patterns . In the first five games , Wilt had scored only 82 points , but he had contributed 37 assists and picked off 148 rebounds . In the final game , he scored 24 , with four assists and 23 rebounds . At the very last , his defensive play was the difference . Behind by only a point with 15 seconds to go , the Warriors still might have won if Barry had been able to see anything but Wilt looming between him and the backboard . Barry 's hopeless shot sailed far off target , and the 76ers picked up another two points on a foul . Final score : Philadelphia 125 , San Francisco 122 , thus giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustration over the fact that he had never been on a title-winning team .
