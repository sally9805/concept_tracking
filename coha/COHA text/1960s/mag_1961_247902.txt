SHADOWS IN THE GRASS ( 149 pp. ) - Isak Dlnesen-Random House ( $3.75 ) . <P> <P> A long time ago , in Africa , Isak Dinesen saw two lions attack an ox . Unarmed but for a stock whip , she flew at the kings of the jungle and lashed them into retreat . <P> Unarmed but for a pen , Isak Dinesen , 75 , has spent the 27 years of her writing life routing the brute realities of the 20th century from her prose . Minute in output but masterful in style and content , Storyteller Dinesen ( Seven Gothic Tales , Anecdotes of Destiny ) pursues gothic romance in preference to realism , the aristocratic spirit above democratic camaraderie , fate before fact . She is Denmark 's finest living writer and one of the world 's best . No less a fan than Ernest Hemingway told his 1958 Nobel Prize audience that the award should have gone to Isak Dinesen . <P> She calls her latest autobiographical book a " papyrus from a pyramid , " and though it is not fiction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medieval Persia and 19th century Italy in which Author Dinesen has sometimes set her tales . In Shadows , she reminisces about the decade ( 1921-31 ) when she ran a coffee plantation in the Ngong hill country of Kenya , an Africa now dead beyond recall and yet startlingly alive in these recollections . Characteristically , her theme - the relation of master and servant-would embarrass many contemporary writers to the roots of their social consciousness , but from her it evokes feudal harmonies rooted in a blood consciousness as profound as the roles of father and son , husband and wife . Her mood-dry , elegiac , wounded yet unbleeding-strongly echoes that of the aristocratic author of the brilliant 19th century Sicilian chronicle and recent bestseller , The Leopard ; this somehow befits a woman whose African nickname was " Honorable Lioness " and whose real name and title are the Baroness Karen Blixen . <P> Dark Roots . What the baroness does in this book is scarcely tangible enough to describe . She dips a branch of memory into the pool of the past until it is crystallized with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if painted by Henri Rousseau . Who else , one wonders , would have attained a great reputation as a healer merely by holding a Barua a Soldani , a letter from a king ( Denmark 's Christian X ) , to the chest of a young native writhing in agony from a badly fractured leg ? As the letter became a relic , stiff with blood and grime , and passed from hand to hand in a cabalistic pouch , it also became " a covenant signed between the Europeans and the Africans - no similar document of this same relationship is likely to be drawn up again . " Many writers affect to understand Africa ; Author Dinesen accepts and respects its opacities ( " All roots demand darkness " ) . She draws a memorable portrait of Farah , her face-conscious Somali majordomo , " unfailingly loyal , a cheetah noiselessly following me about at a distance of five feet , or a falcon holding onto my finger with strong talons and turning his head right and left .
