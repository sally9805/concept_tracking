Anyone who believes , as I do , that Buckpasser may be the best American-bred horse of the last 30 years will share the general disappointment over his loss to stablemate Poker and to Assagai in Saturday 's Bowling Green Handicap at Aqueduct . Buckpasser has been nothing less than sensational during his two and a half seasons of racing . More important than the accumulation of 24 wins in 27 races and $1,342,204 in earnings is the fact that the son of Tom Fool and Busanda has shown the one quality all horsemen appreciate : he has done virtually everything that could be asked of a champion . This includes winning sprints , setting the world record of 1:323/5 for the mile , toting respectable weights in handicaps and beating his elders at weight-for-age over distances up to two miles . From Saratoga to Hialeah and Santa Anita , neither track conditions nor the opposition ever seemed to bother him . // But Saturday , after running up a victory streak of 15 ( just one short of Citation 's modern record ) , Buckpasser finally encountered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much even for him . The reason he was in the mile-and-five-eighths Bowling Green is that it is contested over the Aqueduct turf course , and if Buckpasser , who had never raced on grass , won that race , Owner Ogden Phipps intended to fly him to Paris , where he would face many top European horses  --  all of whom have raced exclusively on turf  --  in the July 2 Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud at a mile and nine-sixteenths. // Phipps and Trainer Eddie Neloy had wisely decided that if the best horse in the U.S. was to be part of any such overseas mission , he would have to be tested as severely as possible . This meant entering the Bowling Green against Assagai , Charlie Engelhard 's 1966 grass-course champion . When Racing Secretary Tommy Trotter assigned Buckpasser 135 pounds and Assagai 127 pounds it meant giving away eight pounds to an established turf runner . Moontrip , who won the Bowling Green in track-record time a year ago with 112 pounds , was back with 113 , and Dunderhead got in with a skimpy 107 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both in the Bowling Green and at Saint-Cloud , was assigned 112. // The other part of the test called for Buckpasser to be shod in French racing plates , which , in order to preserve grass courses , are considerably flatter than ours and without toes or calks . Buckpasser worked in his new shoes before the Bowling Green and , although Neloy was pleased , Jockey Braulio Baeza said his horse was sliding around the turns . // He said it again after the Bowling Green and added glumly , " Buckpasser was beaten by a combination of three things : the grass , the shoes and the weight . For the first half mile he seemed to be fine , but the rest of the way he was sliding all around . " Meanwhile Jockey Bill Boland was playing his role perfectly with Poker . Dictating his own slow pace when the rest of the field took back at the start , Boland let Poker open up three lengths . When it came time to run on the far turn , Assagai just did n't have it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in front , by a length and a half , with Assagai three lengths ahead of Buckpasser . Dunderhead was fourth and Moontrip last . All but Buck-passer wore American shoes , giving them an advantage of up to five lengths , according to some racing experts . // When it was over , Ogden Phipps had the expression of a man who might have been wearing uncomfortable new shoes himself . " If Buckpasser must run in those shoes in Paris the trip is off , " he said . It is a pity that the champion failed this test , and even more of a pity that Parisian racegoers , who have such a great appreciation of excellence in horses , will be denied the opportunity of seeing Buckpasser next week .
