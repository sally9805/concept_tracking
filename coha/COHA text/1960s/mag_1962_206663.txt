The moon 's visible face has long been mapped , its plains and craters named , its cold curves charted . But as U.S. engineers continue their multibillion dollar effort to get the first man-carrying spacecraft to the moon , U.S. astronomers study the earth 's only natural satellite with steadily increasing intensity . For if its visitors are to survive , science must provide them with lunar information that has so far defied centuries of observation . <P> Photographs taken through the great telescope at California 's Lick Observatory , and released last week , reveal the moon 's pockmarked crust in astonishing detail ( see cut ) . Forbidding mountains loom above broad valleys and sharply defined crevasses , just as they will appear to approaching astronauts . But for all their clarity , the pictures leave a vital question unanswered . What is the moon actually made of ? <P> Even the finest optical telescope has yet to supply an answer , so Astronomer David D. Cudaback peered beneath the moon 's surface with a vastly different type of instrument . Using the 32 dish-shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent three months measuring the moon 's own electronic transmissions . He traced the variations in the moon 's electrical characteristics , tracked its composition through yards of abstruse equations and decided that its outer surface is just barely denser than the empty space around it . <P> The moon , says Astronomer Cudaback , is probably covered by a thick porous layer that is as light and airy as finespun cotton candy . It is also possible , he says , that there is a foamy crust of crumbly , crackerjack-like material or a lunar honeycomb with cells intact and filled with gas . The moon got that way , he figures , because it has been bombarded with meteors for billions of years . Striking the moon 's skin with enough energy to melt 100 times their own mass , the meteors liquefied rock or whatever else they hit , splashing gobs of molten material all over the lunar landscape . <P> Dr. Cudaback 's theory may well supply important information for tomorrow 's astronauts , but it also intensifies their problems . The moon 's frothy covering is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
