txt Stiffer regulations against cigarette advertising now seem possible , a congressional survey by The Christian Science Monitor discloses . Certainly , the climate now is right for such action . ? Nearly all of the 200 members of the House who responded to this survey said they were convinced that " there is sufficient medical evidence now available " to persuade them that cigarette smoking is a " serious health hazard . " ? By more than 2 to 1 the 200 respondents expressed a belief that " more should be done in terms of legislation to alert the public to these hazards . " ? Again , by more than a 2-to-1 margin , the respondents said they would favor a stronger warning on cigarette packs . ? Most significant , there was nearly a 2-to-1 margin in favor of " extending this warning to cover all advertising . " ? To the question , " Would you favor authorizing the Federal Communications Commission to regulate the time and types of programs on which cigarette advertising may appear ? " almost half said yes . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighted // " yes " to this question : " Would you favor an eventual ban on cigarette advertising in all media ? " This response does not indicate immediate action of this far-reaching nature now is likely . But it could well be the handwriting on the wall . ? Also , 60 congressmen said " yes " to the qUestion : " Would you favor authorizing the FCC to regulate the total amounts of ciga  --  rette advertising the broadcasting media may carry ? " ? The weight of House opinion is clearly against such action at this time , however . The main theme in the negative votes was , " What more can be done ? " and " You ca n't save people from themselves . " Many expressed worry over " where this could lead us . " Wrote Rep. Samuel L. Devine ( R ) of Ohio : " If regulation and controls are extended , government necessarily would be expected to move in additional areas , such as liquor , etc . " Mr. Devine points out that he is a nonsmoker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( D ) of Texas , another nonsmoker , says : " I see no point in telling someone else not to smoke . " Rep. Jerome R. Waldie ( D ) of California writes : " Unhappily , I am a confirmed smoker unable to break the habit . Perhaps I would not have started knowing then what we know now . " Rep. Don Edwards ( D ) of California ' - called the smoking question " very important . " Mr. Edwards favors- an eventual ban - on cigarette advertising in all media . Rep. Lionel Van Deerlin ( D ) of California - commented : ? " The record of cigarette labeling legislalion which passed in the 89th Congress will show that I offered an amendment that would have required the warning on both wide sides of a cigarette package , rather than the narrow side . I was unsuccessful . " It is my feeling that it would be unfair to infringe on certain advertising media if we are unwilling to impose tighter controls on the sale of cigarettes ( e.g. , cigarette vend : ing machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws may pro . hibit sale to minors ) . Contradiction seen " I should also like to see an end to the cynical contradiction that finds one branch of government warning against the health haZard of smoking , while another  --  the Department of Agriculture --  -- spends money to encourage cigarette smoking in foreign markets . " , , Rep. Emanuel Celler ( D ) of New York urges that cigarettes bear the following warning : " Warning : Cigarette smoking is dangerous to health and may cause death from cancer and other diseases . " He has introduced a bill to achieve this end which reads : " Such statement shall be located in a conspicuous place on every cigarette package and shall appear in conspicuous and legible type in contrast by typography , lay out , or color with other printed matter on the package . " Rep. Henry Helstoski ( D ) of New Jersey also has introduced a bill calling for a stronger warning on the cigarette pack . Of an " eventual ban to all cigarette advertising , " Rep. Floyd V. Hicks ( D ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might eventually reach that position . " Rep. Joseph P. Vigorito ( D ) of . Pennsylvania cites his support for a bill ( that he , too , has introduced ) " which would force cigarette manufacturers to more , positively label each package to emphasize the hazards . " More legislation ? To the question : " Should more be done in , terms of legislation to alert the public to these hazards ? " Rep. Benjamin B. Blackburn ( R ) of Georgia pens in this comment : " Particularly among youth . " Comments A. Sydney Herlong Jr . ( D ) of Florida : " I do n't believe there is a person in the United States who is not aware of the hazards of cigarette smoking . If people want to smoke them , knowing this , no amount of federal legislation with reference to advertising will stop them . " Staying up late at night  --  and burning the candle at both ends  --  is also detrimental to one 's health . Do we want to enact a national curfew ? or close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Pelly ( R ) of Washington would favor an eventual ban on all cigarette advertising : He pens in this comment : " I would favor federal grants by the Public Health Service to the states to provide public education through the schools and otherwise on the hazards of smoking . " Rep. Elmer J. Holland ( D ) of Pennsylvania has this to say : " I am convinced sufficient publicity has been given to acquaint the public with the hazards of smoking . If they wish to continue to smoke , knowing the possible outcome , then it is their business to die the way they wish . " Political muscle involved One congressman who wanted to remain anonymous said this : " Let 's face it , though . When you combine the money and power of the tobacco and liquor interests with advertising agencies , newspapers , radio , and television , all of whom profit from the astronomical advertising budgets involved , there is too much political muscle involved to expect much accomplishment . " Another congressman responded in this way : " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is also true of other items consumed by the public . In a free society where does one draw the line as to what may or may not be advertised , or when and how ? " And another congressman writes : " The State of Arkansas once had a prohibition on cigarettes , and even prohibited the distribution of cigarette paper with smoking tobacco . It was a vain law . " Rep. John J. Duncan ( R ) of Tennessee : " It would appear that alcoholic beverages are a much greater hazard to health than Congressional Quarterly Pinpointing the habit By smoking status according to age , chart shows the percentage distribution of the United States population 17 years and over . is tobacco . Should such restrictions extend to beer and other such beverages ? " I am a nonsmoker , but if we are going to regulate one item , we should consider all others . I think there has been an abundance of advertising and information on such so-called hazards of smoking . But it has caused nothing but increased consumption . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
