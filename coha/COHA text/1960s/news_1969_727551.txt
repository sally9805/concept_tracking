txt The possibility of a detente between Communist China and the United States is a growing , nagging concern to the Soviet leadership . One of the most delicate diplomatic tasks for the Nixon administration , in fact , may well be how to ease Washington 's relations with Peking without antagonizing Moscow . Peking 's growing assertiveness is not lost on the Kremlin . When the Russians . occupied Czechoslovakia , the Chinese responded with a slashing attack on Soviet policy . Since then they have begun to reemerge from their diplomatic cocoon . The number of visitors to Peking from Africa and Asia has increased . The Chinese have made more visits to Albania , paid attention to Romania , and even uttered some pleasant words about Yugoslavia . The most disquieting initiative , from Moscow 's point of view , came with the Chinese proposals for another meeting with the U.S. in Warsaw on Feb. 20 . Peking suggested // moves treabl ?

In the past , Peking has demanded that the United States pull out of Taiwan and recognize Communist China 's authority over the island . Now it appears to the Soviets that Peking is softening its demands . It seems to be calling merely for the withdrawal of the fairly modest contingent of U.S. forces on Taiwan . In Washington , however , diplomatic sources doubted that the Chinese approach of Nov. 26 contained any significant difference from earlier such proposals . In " particular , they said that the language used in reference to Taiwan was similar to that used in the past . ? In the light , of these proposals , the Russians have become even more suspicious than usual of U.S. intentions , particularly since American policymakers now talk of reviewing Washington 's China policy . This concern apparently is not discussed with Western diplomats here but it has been a subject of conversation with the neutrals . And it is reflected in recent articles about the Warsaw talks . There has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most recent issue of the monthly Now Mir carries a review of half a dozen books on China published in 1967 and 1968 . And the book dealer 's list for 1969 recently added another title : " The U.S.A. and China . " Linked to negotiations Soviet edginess over a possible Sino-American demarche is linked with the Vietnam negotiations in Paris . Last year Moscow became the principal backer of Hanoi , and Peking 's proposal for a kind of " peaceful coexistence " pact with the U.S. has an ominous ring for the Russians . ? Writing in the Dec. 25 issue of New Times , well-known commentator Dmitry Volsky interprets the Peking proposals as a bid to reassert its role in Asia by making a deal with the United States . The Paris talks , he says , persuaded the Chinese that some settlement in Southeast Asia is inevitable and that if they want a say they will have to reassert their role . The easiest way is.to talk with the United States . " . . , It is not a proper'settlement in Vietnam , not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , " writes Mr. Volsky . " They are afraid they might miss the ' bus - and be left without a say in the problems of Southeast Asia . And it is from Washington 's hands that they expect to get the bus ticket  --  naturally for a suitable price . " ' Cover for collaboration As for the U.S. side , Mr. Volsky ' sees American business covetously eying the Chine-se market . The Americans , he says , area afraid of being outdistanced by other capitalist countries  --  notably West Germany , which , also to the Soviets ' growing dismay , is doing more and more business with the Chinese . Still another Soviet commentator recently accused China and U.S. " reactionary circles " of joining forces against the Soviet Union . " Chinese-American peaceful coexistence is only a hypocritical cover for collaboration being planned on an anti-Soviet basis , " he declared . Analysts here believe that such suspiciousness reflects the Russians deep-seated fear of China . Not in the short run perhaps . The Soviet Union has a concentration of troops and missiles along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any military threat . But there is an undercurrent ofuneasiness among the Soviets stemming from the awareness that they are living next to 700 million Chinese along a tremendous frontier and that their own eastern lands are sparsely populated . Matching of initiative In the opinion of some Western diplomats , Washington in the month ahead will have a difficult course to steer in its China policy . The dilemma will be how to open a dialogue with China without letting the Russians think it is directed against them . It is felt that the U.S. can not afford to take any initiative toward the Chinese that is not matched with an equal initiative to Moscow . The U.S. , in their view , must make itself available to both sides . These diplomats further note that while it may be in the U.S. interests to cultivate ties with China , the Soviet Union remains the more reasonable of the two powers-It is more realistic , they say , for the U.S. to be on closer terms with the Communist power which has recognized the daggers of promoting world revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
