THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment AOTUMBA , a town near Mexico City , has a general store called La Gran Sociedad . MONG the committees of the Royal Entomological Society of London is a Committee for the Protection of British Insects . Line NEw YORK 'S newest underground Happening , the twenty-four-hour ticket line at the Metropolitan Opera House , takes place every weekend in a bleak , drafty Lincoln Center tunnel that is governed , appropriately , by the Parks Department . Unrehearsed , unsponsored , and , we suspect , unwelcorned by the authorities who rule the Center , this persistent cultural event is composed of several hundred chilly opera buffs who are drawn together on Saturday by an irresistible urge to buy tickets on Sunday . The Metropolitan doles out a week 's supply of tickets five weeks in advance  --  two per opera to a customer  --  at noon on Sunday . Since there are usually . between six hundred and nine hundred people standing in line by the time the box office opens , most performances sell out in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line as a permanent institution was guaranteed by a chronic shortage of tickets . The old Metropolitan , with a subscription rate of seventy per cent , put a minimum of seven hundred and forty-four blocked-view seats on public sale for every performance . The new Metropolitan , with many-more subscribers and few side-view seats , has increased its financial security by reducing the supply of tickets at the box office ; the number now ranges from two hundred and fifty on Mondays and Fridays , when subscribers fill ninety per cent of the house , to about six hundred for a Saturday matinee , when the subscription rate drops to eighty per cent . Standing room is stabilized at a hundred and seventy-five places per opera  --  fifty fewer than in the old house . As for new subscriptions , they are practically impossible to obtain ; the Metropolitan has a waiting list of three thousand would-he subscribers . Excluding benefit performances ( which can cost up to fifty dollars a seat ) , the grand total of non-subscription operas scheduled for the regular 1966-67 season is seven . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that getting into any Ntetropolitan performance has become a highly organized endurance contest . Properly speaking , the opera line consists of two lines , containing two kinds of people . The aristocrats are the standees ; poor , young , musically sophisticated , and inclined to be philosophical about physical hardship , they arc the heirs of a tradition of camping-out-tohear-opera that goes back to the opening of the old Metropolitan , in 1883 . The parvenus are the seat buyers , whose overnight line began with the opening of the new house . Generally speaking , they are indoor types , older and wealthier and permanently enraged over the difficulties they encounter at the box office . Each of the two lines begins to form early on Saturday morning , with a handwritten register . Applicants are signed up in numerical order by " the keeper of the list " ? the first person in line  --  and are ordinarily required to report hack for roll call every two hours . Between checks , everyone is free to wander about : the seat line vanishes into restaurants and warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunnel wall and settle down to books , transistor phonographs , and word games . Anyone who misses a roll call has his name struck off the list and must start again from the end of the line . Exceptions are granted to people who are attending opera and concert performances , provided they show their tickets to the keeper of the list . We dropped by Lincoln Center on a recent chilly Saturday evening and found everything in full swing . Mr. Anthony van der Linde , a tall , thirtyyear-old Dutch diamond sorter , produced a schedule and informed us that the most popular performances of the week in question would be two " Don Giovanni " s and a " Bohme . " Three Wagner ope ras ? " T ristan , " " Loh e n-grin , " and " Meistersinger " ? were runners-up , and , finally , there was a non-subscription r ' r 10 r a ri c e of " Lucia , " for which , he assured us , plenty of seats would he available . We signed up on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we were told to go home for the evening . " Attendance is a little low tonight , because of the cold weather , so Pm going to make the next roll call at 4:30 A.M. , " van der Linde said . We wandered across the tunnel to chat with David Smith , who was acting as the unofficial chief of the standees . Mr. Smith , a short man of twenty-seven with blue eyes , brown hair , a firm jaw , and an even disposition , told us that he was a foreman in a plastics factory and that he spent just about every weekend of the season in the standee line . " I thoroughly look forward to coming down here , " he said . " I 've made a lot of friends and some enemies , because I try to run things fairly . Most of my people are regulars and know the rules , but there are always a few troublemakers , who have to he watched . The Lincoln Center and the Metropolitan security men recognize and respect these lines  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storming the box office  --  hut they 've made it clear to us that we have to maintain order during the night . I see to it that my people do n't block doorways , become noisy , or litter the pavement . " At four-thirty on Sunday morning , we returned to the tunnel , to find Smith tucked away in his sleeping bag and van der Linde , heavy-eyed , hoarse , and shivering , preparing to call his roll . Seat-line people were straggling down the ramp from Sixty-second Street under harsh electric lights , bundled up in blankets , heavy coats , capes , hats , scarves , and hoots . Two girls shot out of a taxicab just as their names were called ; a group of college students hailed van der Linde as they sprinted down the ramp . A few names were struck off the list and , after a pause for rearrangement , van der Linde gave everybody his new number . We moved up to 31 . No. 30 , in front of us , was a short , volatile Spaniard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he came in from New Jersey every weekend to buy Family Circle seats . " My wife and I met as standees in the old Metropolitan , but we had to stop going when the children were small , " he said . " Now that we can afford to sit , it 's so difficult to get tickets . I have a theory that the Metropolitan regards this line as a process of purification ; they fix it so you have to suffer to see an opera . Of course , it has to he a good opera , with a good cast . I stood in line once for ' Antony and Cleopatra ' and then dropped it from my repertoire . " No. 32 , behind us , turned out to be Mrs. Lydia Edwardina McKnight , an eighty-year-old opera lover who is a Metropolitan landmark . " I run a music school at the Y.11.1. - Y.W.H.A. in Eastchester , and I come down here every weekend , " Mrs. McKnight said , peering up at us from a nest of scarves . " I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm certainly not going to stop now just because they make it hard for us to get seats . I can sleep anywhere . Opera is my life . " At 8:30 A.M. , there were a hundred and sixty seat buyers and a hundred and thirty-seven standees waiting in the tunnel . Van der Linde and Smith moved down the lines , calling off names and pushing people into place . " The policemen told us that if you form groups and talk loudly they 'll throw you out , " van der Linde said . " Please stay behind one another ; it 's for your own benefit . " " What time did you get in line , to be up front ? " a woman in a mink coat asked . " I was here last night , Madam , " van der Linde formally replied . " Oh ! " she said , horrified . An elderly man standing behind her remarked bitterly that the Metropolitan ought to find a better place for the lines . " In Vienna , you assemble in a heated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why- not here ? " " Sir , this tunnel belongs to the Parks Department , " van der Linde said , " You should complain to the city , not to the Metropolitan , " " I may do that , " the man said morosely . At ten-thirty , van der Linde called the roll again and , this time , handed numbered tags to the first two hundred and fifty people . A hundred and fifty more seat buyers at the end of the line would have to shift for themselves , he told us . " The Metropolitan people recognize our tags and the standees ' list , and they admit the lines into the house on this basis , " he said . " When you think about it , we do all the work for them . " We Clutched our tag firmly and walked out for a breath of fresh air before eleven o'clock , when the line would be locked in . En route , we paused to chat with several late arrivals . Albert McGee , a lawyer , who held No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , he told us , he had snatched up in a moment of madness from his living room . " It 's a family heirloom , but at the crack of dawn you do n't think about things like that , " he said . " I only knew that it was light . " Mr. McGee , who was going to the new Metropolitan for the first time , planned to buy two tickets for " Meistersinger . " A little farther along , at No. 120 , we found Miss Marion Schwartz , a social worker , who was picking up " Don Giovanni " seats for friends from out of town . " Metropolitan tickets make wonderful presents , because everybody knows they 're so hard to get , " she told us . At eleven-thirty-five , the glass doors that separated all of us from the basement of the Opera House opened and both lines moved up to the sun-drenched main floor . There the lines diverged ; the standees stayed in the south lobby , and the seat buyers shuttled across the marble floor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Robert Jackson , a tall , dignified Metropolitan security man , walked down the seat line greeting his regular customers through a cloud of cigar smoke . " My problems begin at noon , when the lobby doors are opened to the public , " Mr. Jackson told us . " You have no idea what people think up to try and get tickets the easy way . They push into the line ; they try to bribe people who are already there ; they say it 's an anniversary or a birthday ; they plead and they threaten . One man showed inc a badge and told me he Was a parole officer . Another bought two tickets for an opera at one window and then sneaked over to another window and tried to buy two more for the same performance . He knew it was against the rules , but he did n't seem to think the rules applied to him . " Under Jackson 's benevolent but alert gaze , we bought two tickets for " Dun Giovanni " and took up a position against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up several pairs of Family Circle seats  --  for different evenings  --  and skipped happily away . Mrs. McKnight , after a brief argument with the ticket agent at her window , who seemed to know her well , bought two balcony seats for every performance . Miss Schwartz waltzed by with " Giovanni " scats and a happy smile . McGee , who turned up somewhat later , came away with his gold chair and four orchestra seats  --  two for " Meistersinger " and two for " Lohengrin . " " It did n't seem right to buy for only one performance after waiting in line for hours , " he said . " I guess I 'm hooked . " ? THE instructions for preparing a product called 3-Minute Oats advise boiling for five to seven minutes . Frimho ) s Frolic NOT so long ago , we spent a happy day riding the rails with a fine old friend of ours , Mr. Ernest M. Frimbo . Mr. Frimbo is the world 's leading railroad buff . He has travelled close to two million miles by train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He drops us a line from time to time , generally choosing to write on gaudy special stationery run up for crack expresses now long gone . His latest letter arrived one morning in December , and it was an invitation . The notepaper had a colored picture of a columbine in the upper left-hand corner . Just below the flower the words " The Columbine " were printed in a tasteful script . The columbine is the state flower of Colorado , and The Columbine was a train that used to run from Chicago to Denver . It was discontinued twenty-five years ago . I am inviting you to accompany me on an excursion arranged by the Electric Railroaders ' Association Frimbo wrote . The train will go up the Harlem Division tracks of the New York Central to North White Plains , then over the Hudson Division tracks to Harmon , where there will be a tour of the shops and the repair facilities , and then down over the Spuyten Duyvil Bridge and on the West Side freight-line tracks in Manhattan down to Thirtieth Street . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an S Class electric locomotive , built in 1906 . Of course , that is not quite so grand as a steam locomotive  --  my first love  --  but at least it is not a diesel . We will cross the Grand Central Loop and the New York &; Harlem s-ye . There will also be a surprise ! Meet me on the upper level of G.C.T. at 9 sharp . Yrs. , E. 11.1 . Fatmao P.S. : I know you like to be informed of my totals , and I have done some adding , and the figure as of the week before Labor Day , 1966 , is one million nine hundred and six thousand seven hundred and eighty-one miles . I do n't expect it will get much bigger before I see you . The day we met Frimho at Grand Central Terminal was perfect cold and clear and cloudless . We arrived on the upper level at the stroke of nine , and found our friend waiting for us . He was looking extraordinarily fit . His skin was pink and firm , his eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professes to prefer had weather , because , he says , then he can think of all the hundreds of grounded planes , and all the thousands of people who are sitting in airports listening to had music and not getting where they want to go , but he obviously enjoys good days when they come along . The last time we had seen him , seven or eight months earlier , he looked a little depressed . He had been hoping to go to Yugoslavia and Turkey in the summer and ride on some of the steam trains along the Adriatic and in Anatolia , but his plans had fallen through . A friend of ours who was with us at the time tried to cheer him up , saying , " Why do n't you go to Greece instead ? " Frimbo stopped looking depressed and started looking angry . " Greece is mostly diesel , " he said . Frimho was wearing an old gray tweed suit with blue stripes , which he keeps for such occasions , and he was standing at the front of our train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That is Engine No. 110 , " he said as soon as he caught sight of us . " She 'll he pulling us today . Sixty years old and still pulling a train That 's more than I can say about most people I know . When I first came to New York , in 1912 , it was in a train with an engine about like that one , as I recall . Grand Central was being built  --  it was in very much the same shape that Penn Station is in right now  --  and the tracks on Park Avenue were an open cut . " A number of boys with cameras began to cluster around No. 1 10 , and one of them politely asked Frimho to step hack , so that he could get a better shot . Frimbo looked disgusted . " There are two kinds of railroad buffs , " he said . " Class A is strictly utilitarian and informational . Class B , which I am afraid is what this person is , is what we call a daisy picker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a good turnout , at least . And I was almost forgetting the surprise I promised you . Look down the train and tell me what you see . " We did so , and said that we saw seven coaches and a diner . " Exactly , " Frimbo said . " A diner . I ca n't remember that there ever was a dining car on any train on the West Side line . Years ago , there was passenger service on the West Side , but that was only the Dolly Varden , which was a train that consisted of one coach and ran in the middle of the night . It ran at a11 only because the railroad was legally obliged to maintain passenger service . The franchises given to the railroads in the old days often included requirements like that . My stepmother 's grandfather sold a large tract of land to the Pennsy outside Cincinnati with the proviso that the railroad erect a small flag stop on his land . The station was n't any bigger than a rabbit hutch , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to stop , even if it was the Cincinnati Limited . Those delightful days are gone , but today we will consume a meal , or part of one , as we roll down the West Side of Manhattan . My friends will be beside themselves with jealousy . " Frimbo consulted his watch . It is a pocket watch , modern and small , which he likes because it keeps good time and because whenever he opens its case  --  an alligator one  --  it automatically winds up . " Time to get aboard , " be said . " You may have noticed that the engine is facing due south , into the heart of Grand Central Terminal . That 's because we are about to swing around one of the loops  --  semicircular pieces of track right under the station . Then we 'll he headed in the right direction . They put m two loop tracks when they built the station , so commuter trains would n't have to hack and foul everything up , and this will he only the second time I have ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forties . " We followed Frimho aboard the train and through the coaches to the one next to the diner . The coach was full of noisy and happy buffs , and many of them recognized him . " Why , hello , Ernest ! " one huff said . " Have n't seen you since Richmond . " The National Railway Historical Society had held a meeting in Richmond over the Labor Day weekend . " A fruitful weekend , " Frimbo said . " Bad Southern cooking but good Southern steam locomotives . " At one end of the coach , two young men had set up a bookstall , and Frimbo went straight to it . They were offering about thirty tides , and Frimbo bought twenty-four books and pamphlets and whatnot , including " Articulated Cars of North America , " " Rapid Transit Lines in Boston , " and " The Steam Railroad Calendar for 1967 . " While he was paying for his purchases , the train started , passed around the loop , and headed for North White Plains . Frimho settled down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aisle from him was a serious-looking young man wearing a Cavalier EE Auto 35 camera . The young man looked shy , but he also looked as though he very much wanted to say something to Frimbo , and pretty soon he plucked up courage , " Mr. Frimbo , " he said formally , " I must tell YOU that you left a serious impression on me last year when you spoke before the Railroad Enthusiasts . I wonder if I might ask you : What is your favorite train ? " Frimho considered . " I guess the Broadway Limited , " he replied . The young man ventured another question . " Mr. Frimbo , I am faced with a tough decision , " he said . " I am more of a passenger-coach fan than anything else , and I , with some other fellows , have the opportunity to bay one . On the other hand , I could spend that money riding around the country on trains . Would you give me your advice ? " " It 's a tough choice , all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain . Ride . Do the U.S. Cover as much ground as you can . In five years , you wo n't be able to go from coast to coast by train . I have travelled one million nine hundred and fourteen thousand seven hundred and eight miles , by my latest reckoning , and I have never regretted a single mile . " " Mr. Frimbo , I will take your advice , " the young man said firmly . " I admire you . You are like an encyclopedia . I would just love to copy some of your life , if at all possible . I have travelled ten thousand two hundred and ninety-two miles this year . " He paused , and Frimbo said , " Good . " man The young said , " Thank you , sir . I think I will step into the dining car . " Frimho turned to us , trying to look displeased . " You see bow I am forced to act as housemaster , " he said in a whisper . Suddenly his eye was caught by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have reached Melrose , " he said , in his usual voice . " That little branch line over there was always used when F.D.R. was President to transfer his train from the New Haven tracks corning out of Penn Station from Washington unto the Central line , to take him up to Hyde Park . A friend of mine had to work out the Presidential route and always accompanied that train , which ran at night and carried special armor-plated cars . Everything was kept very secret . " He laughed . " For anyone who knew anything about trains , it was n't much of a secret . That branch line is the only piece of track connecting the N.Y. , N.H. &; H.R.R. and the N.Y.C. , and , short of floating the President across the Hudson River on a car barge , it was the only conceivable route his train could use . " Our train reached North White Plains a few minutes later and stopped for a while , so that the daisy pickers could get a few snapshots . Then it started back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the junction of the Harlem Division and the Hudson Division . The wye is a short , curved piece of track connecting the two divisions , and even Frimho had never been on it before . It is normally used only by freight trains . He was much pleased when the train stopped briefly on the wye , waiting for an allclear signal on the main-line tracks of the Hudson Division , and he got to talking about railroad language . " It 's a good language , and etymologically sound , and it gets inc irritated when ignorant people start miscalling things , " he said . " Take that station of my step-mother 's grandfather . It was a flag stop , because you put up a flag when you wanted the train to stop , but most people , not knowing any better , would call it a whistle stop . A lot of good it would do to blow a whistle at a thundering express train . And take milk trains . Over and over again I 've heard people say , ' Sorry we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' meaning they had to take a local . They just do n't think . If a milk train stopped at every flag stop , the milk would be sour before it got near the city . The milk train is actually the fastest train there is . And another thing . I remember once watching a long freight roll by out in New Mexico with a friend of mine and his oung son . ' Look , Son , here comes the caboose , ' this dumb friend of mine said to his kid . ' You can always tell the rear end of the train by the caboose , because " caboose " means " rear end . " ' That got me boiling . The caboose , I told him , is the end of the train , but it certainly does n't mcan the end of the train , because it is the office of the conductor , who is the head of the train , and it is his car  --  he can fix it up the way he wants . The word is derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . ' At least , that 's what every railroader believes . " At Harmon , Frimbo joined the tour of the railroad sheds , but he did n't say much . He remembers the days when the sheds were used to repair steam engines , and the sight of a lot of disabled diesels clearly gave him no pleasure . But he perked up when we got hack on the train and headed for the Spuyten Duyvil Bridge  --  the little drawbridge , under the Henry Hudson Bridge , that leads to the West Side freight-line tracks . " We will now proceed to the diner and participate in a historic event , " he announced . The diner was offering sandwiches , and Frimbo ordered a hamburger and ate it with great enjoyment . The train crossed the drawbridge and made its way through Inwood Hill Park , Fort Try-on Park , Fort Washington Park , and Riverside Park , staying close to the Hudson . All around it were bare trees , and , try as we could , we were unable to make out a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Washington Bridge . We saw very few people , too ; the tennis courts just below the lighthouse were occupied , and one woman and one dog were taking the air . Frimho looked contented . " I call this the Invisible Manhattan , " he said . " If an outsider were to approach this city for the first time on these tracks , he would think Manhattan was a small hill town . Soon we 'll leave the country and enter a tunnel , and go downtown in darkness behind all those funny broken windows you can see from the West Side Drive , but for the moment we can enjoy a railroad-preserved rusticity . Roads bring filling stations and pizza parlors , but a railroad likes trees . " Below Seventy-second Street , the train emerged from the tunnel and headed south through an open cut between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues . ? Before the cut was constructed , in 1929 and 1930 , the trains had used tracks on those avenues . They were allowed to go no faster than four miles an hour , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as a Tenth Avenue cowboy , who cleared the way . Frimbo likes the cut , because from it it is possible to see  --  in the block above the Jost Brothers Jewelry Mfg . Co. , at 514 West Forty-eighth Street  --  a small and battered grape arbor in a hack yard . Upon leaving the cut , the train entered the Thirtieth Street Freight Yards , which railroad men call the St. John 's Park Freight Station the name of the original ter-minal of the line , south of Canal Street , a building that was torn down years ago . Here we stopped , on a steel viaduct overlooking the yard , and Frimbo descended from the dining car to get a better view . This was the penultimate stop of the excursion , and the engine moved to the northern end of the train , in order to take us hack uptown . It was getting dark , and a few clouds , the first of the day , glowed pinkly over the rooftops of AVcehawken and Hoboken . Frimbo ? led us hack to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I look forward to 1967 , " he said . " I expect to ride on trains in Australia and Czechoslovakia , among other places , and by this time next year I 'll be into ml third million . " He paused to examine a small blueprint of a passenger coach , which he had come across in his briefcase . We noticed that the polite young man who had promised to take Frimbo 's advice had resumed his seat across the aisle and was also examining Frimbo 's blueprint . After a while , Frimbn looked up and saw him . " Would you like to have this ? " he asked . It was obvious that the young man would , but he was too shy to say so , and so he said , " No , thank you . " The youth busied himself with a briefcase of his own , and then said that he had forgotten his cap in the dining car , and left his seat . Frimbo did n't say anything , but pretty soon he got up and tiptoed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slipped the blueprint into the young man 's briefcase , and tiptoed hack to his own seat , sitting down with a sigh . " A frolicsome trip , " Frimbo said .
