The doors of the rundown mansion in Caracas were open wide , and the crowd spilled out to the street . From a flag-draped speaker 's dais inside , a red-faced orator roared into a microphone . " We are proud that the bankers do n't like us. ' ' said Dr. Gonzalo Garcia Bustillos , 35 . " The oligarchic classes hate us , and we are proud of it . Our strength is with the working class and with the youth . ' ' In front of him , a student claque chanted , " Less rich , less poor , less rich , less poor . " and from outside came shouts of " Rusia no ! Yanquis no ! Latinoamrica si ! " <P> The meeting was the first Caribbean conference of Christian Democracy , Latin America 's newest and possibly its fastest-growing political force , though it has yet to win power in any of the hemisphere 's 22 nations . Described by Garcia Bustillos , the Venezuelan Congressman who opened the meeting , as " international but not an International , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalism and Communism . They preach a social revolution that must use orderly and just means . They advocate immediate agrarian reform , demand careful state regulation of corporate profits , and complete labor union , freedom . Says Lenidas Xausa , 28 , city councilman in Prto Alegre , Brazil : " The future of Latin America will be decided between Christian Democracy and Communism . " <P> Magna Carta . Latin America 's Christian Democrats share a common heritage with the powerful European Christian Democratic parties , led by Germany 's Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and Italy 's late Premier Alcide de Gasperi . Like the Europeans , they base their philosophy on the famed Rerum Novarum encyclical of Pope Leo XIII , issued 70 years ago and known as " the Magna Carta of Labor " because it advocated labor unions and insisted that the state guarantee to the worker a fair share of the fruits of his labors . <P> The movement gained its first Latin American foothold in Argentina during World War I , spread to neighboring Uruguay and Chile in the late 1920s . But only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perils of Communism have become increasingly clear to many Latin Americans , has Christian Democracy begun to show vitality . Chile , where the party has been operating for 25 uninterrupted years , is still its strongest bastion . Led by dynamic Senator Eduardo Frei , 50 , the Christian Democrats won 20% of the vote in the 1958 presidential elections , believe that " within a few years " they will be the strongest of Chile 's five major parties . <P> Campus Victory . In Venezuela , operating as the Copei party , Christian Democrats won a surprising 16% of the votes in the 1958 presidential elections , now cooperate in Winner Rmulo Betancourt 's coalition government , and won last month 's hotly contested Student Federation elections at the University of Caracas , whose student leadership was once almost completely Marxist .
