The late Jan Mller had little sympathy with conventional notions of beauty ; his visions were tormented , and he purposely painted them as bluntly as he knew how . As could be seen last week at a retrospective exhibition at Manhattan 's Guggenheim Museum , Mller was a painter of extraordinary power and skill : even at his most grotesque he fascinates where a lesser talent would only repel . <P> In the 35 years of his life , German-born Jan Mller knew few moments of tranquillity . When he was ten , the Nazis arrested his father for campaigning against Hitler , and though friends managed to secure his release through bribery , the elder Mller realized that he and his family had to flee . The Mllers went to Prague , only to find the city overburdened with refugees already . For Jan Mller , life became one long search for a home-in Switzerland , in Amsterdam , in Paris . When World War II broke out , the French interned the boy as a German ; when the French surrendered , he fled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jan got to Spain , to Lisbon , and finally to the U.S. He worked as a dishwasher , a factory worker , a day-camp instructor ; but in 1945 he decided to devote himself to painting . He studied at the Art Students League , six months later switched to the school run by Hans Hofmann , the most influential teacher of U.S. abstract expressionism . But Mller could not follow so doctrinaire a master for long . <P> By 1950 he had started working in a mosaic style which , though still abstract , was tightly disciplined . But the mosaics did not satisfy him either . " Abstraction is no longer enough for me , " he said . " So I 'm returning to the image . The image gives one a wider sense of communication . " <P> Time Ticked Away . For his subject matter , Mller often used episodes from the Bible , from Shakespeare and Goethe . He did a series of landscapes and also a number of figure paintings which , like The Accusation , had no literary source . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grim humor , the mood of despair persists . The composition of his landscapes is brilliant ; but the landscape is so clogged with color that it becomes airless , a kind of prison . In the figure paintings , his creatures are chalky , emaciated scarecrows that stare out from cruel masklike faces . They accuse , torture , mock ; they crouch on each others shoulders , ride each other 's naked backs . To a large extent , the theme of Jan Mller 's work is humanity devouring itself . <P> The despair was intensified by the state of Mller 's health . Since the age of 13 he had suffered from attacks of rheumatic fever . In 1954 a plastic valve was inserted into his heart to replace a damaged natural valve . The new valve made a ticking noise with every heartbeat , a cruel reminder that the operation had been only partially successful and that time was running out . Four years later , having worked feverishly to the end , Jan Mller was dead .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
