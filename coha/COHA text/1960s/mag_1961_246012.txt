Except for a few cooking fires , it was dark when the seven truckloads of Portuguese soldiers came . They took me and many of our village down to the river . I heard many shots , and four men near me fell into the river . Then a Portuguese soldier stuck me many times in the back with the knife on his rifle . He kicked me into the river . I grabbed a branch and it carried me downstream . I crawled out and lay all the next day in the bush . Some friends found me and carried me here , where they are making me well . <P> His black body starkly thin against the white sheets , the speaker was Jean Felix , 22 , a refugee from the nine-week-old revolt in Portuguese Angola . Two bayonet thrusts had gone completely through his chest ; one had cut a kidney in half . He was recovering in the Christian Medical Institute Hospital at Kimpese in the Congo , 20 miles north of the Angola border . <P> Walking , hobbling on crutches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been streaming across the border at the rate of over 800 a day since the revolt began . All have their stories of indiscriminate Portuguese brutality . Pedro Neves , 30 , took a bullet in the leg when two Portuguese army planes strafed his village of Tumbi . Twelve-year-old Andre Destino 's village of Boa Nuta was first strafed , then raided by troops in trucks . They shot and killed his father and brother , left him for dead with his left buttock shot away . " I estimate we 've killed 30,000 of these animals already , " bragged one Portuguese army officer in Luanda . " There are perhaps 100,000 of them in revolt-and we intend to kill every one of them when the dry season starts late in May . " <P> Both estimates are probably way too high . Congo observers , working with the scraps of information that leak out past the iron censorship that Dictator Antonio de Oliveira Salazar has clamped on Angola , think as many as 7,000 Africans have been killed-many without reason , since probably no more than 2,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black rebels have given the Portuguese provocation enough for savagery . Working in bands of 20 to 30 , the rebels paint their faces red to make themselves " invisible , " smoke marijuana for " bullet proofing , " wear their trousers inside out as a means of identification on hit-and-run raids . Intent on terrorizing whites indiscriminately , they are not content just to kill ; they also mutilate , plucking out eyes , severing hands . Altogether , the rebels are estimated to have killed some 600 Angolan whites . Last week the Portuguese , who all along have claimed that the revolt was not spontaneous but instigated from the outside , reported that army troops had captured 71 well-armed Ghanaian guerrillas fighting alongside the rebels . Rebel leader Holden Roberto , who directs the rebellion from his Leopoldville headquarters , has insisted that his U.P.A. has not had help from Ghana , professes to scorn Nkrumah as too leftist . But Ghana and Guinea have fostered a rival Communist-dominated group called the Movement for the Liberation of Angola ( M.P.L.A. ) , and Nkrumah 's meddlesome African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion in Angola .
