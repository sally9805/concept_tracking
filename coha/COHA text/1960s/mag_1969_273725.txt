Richard Wellington McLaren likes to tell a story that says a great deal about his main concern as Nixon 's chief trustbuster . There was an executive whose firm had been taken over by a con glomerate . Wrote the executive to a friend : " You ask me what it 's like to work for a conglomerate ? Well , it 's just like being a mushroom . First , they keep you in the dark for months . Then they throw dung all over you . Then they can you . " <P> Assistant Attorney General McLaren is trying mightily to dispel the dark . Since January , when he switched from lucrative private practice as a lawyer defending companies in antitrust cases , he has flailed conglomerates for evils ranging from excessive economic concentration to " human dislocation . " Proud that Republicans " have historically been vigorous enforcers of antitrust , " McLaren is becoming the most active-and visible-trustbuster since the days of Teddy Roosevelt ; his broadsides have helped chill investor enthusiasm for multimarket companies . <P> Getting Out of Hand . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for trustbusters " lies in the area of conglomerate mergers . He charges that his Democratic predecessors , by taking the position that mergers of companies in unrelated businesses were not subject to existing antitrust law , " let the merger movement get clear out of hand . " In rapid succession , he has announced actions against three big conglomerates . His trustbusters are contesting Ling-Temco-Vought 's takeover of Jones &; Laughlin Steel ; ITT 's acquisition of Canteen Corp . and Northwest Industries ' attempt to buy up B. F. Goodrich . Such mergers , McLaren says , are forcing " a radical restructuring " of the economy . The restructuring that he is talking about is not based on valid economic grounds , he contends , but rather on financial considerations . He is confident that the courts will agree with him . <P> Undeniably , conglomerate mergers have dramatically accelerated the concentration of U.S. industrial power ( see Corporations ) . Yet McLaren 's view of them is disputed by many experts on legal grounds , and his ideas stumble on some basic contradictions . While he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he insists that in the case of conglomerates size alone is potentially anticompetitive . Therefore , he is not likely to miss an opportunity to challenge " giant acquisitions " even if no actual restraint of trade is involved . This action , he believes , would tend to retard such possible abuses of economic power as reciprocity . He fears , for example , that a huge diversified company would be tempted to " systematically use its tremendous purchasing power to make sales " by inducing suppliers to buy its own products .
