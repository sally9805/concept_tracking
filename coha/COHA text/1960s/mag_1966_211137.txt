All summer long the world of physics has suffered from scientific confusion-all because experimenters from Columbia University and the State University of New York announced that they had demonstrated that nature 's laws of symmetry are not inviolate . Now , less than three months later , order has apparently been restored . At a conference in Berkeley last week , scientists from the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) sided with symmetry . Their own more comprehensive experiment , they said , showed no evidence of a violation of symmetry . <P> Center of the scientific storm is a subatomic particle called the eta meson , which lives for only a billionth of a billionth of a second before breaking down into three smaller particles called pions-one positive , one negative , one without any electrical charge . According to the laws of symmetry , the positive and negative pions should have identical energies . But when a team led by Columbia University 's Dr. Paolo Franzini examined 1,441 photographs of eta-meson decay in the Brookhaven bubble chamber ( TIME , July 8 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pion apparently had more energy than its negative counterpart-a significant violation of symmetry . <P> Reversing the Field . In their experiment at Geneva , the European physicists also studied eta-meson decay . They analyzed 10,665 photographs of tracks made by pions in the CERN spark chamber , and in their larger , more reliable statistical sample , they found no significant difference in the energy levels of positive and negative pions . <P> Because the Brookhaven bubble chamber has a fixed magnetic field , the positive pions that Franzini studied always curved in one direction , while the negative pions went the other way . If the field had been uneven for any reason , the higher positive-pion energy levels detected at Brookhaven might well have been erroneous . In the CERN spark chamber , the magnetic field was periodically reversed to make sure that positive and negative pions would both be subject to any variations in the field . <P> Though most scientists at the Berkeley meeting privately sided with the CERN findings , none would state flatly that symmetry had , after all , been restored . Franzini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brookhaven in an attempt to confirm the violations they reported ; still another team led by Columbia University Physicist Leon Lederman will attempt a similar experiment , and the CERN scientists plan to make more tests of their own . " The evidence from the CERN experiments is by no means conclusive , " says Franzini defiantly . " Many more experiments are needed before we can say who is right . "
