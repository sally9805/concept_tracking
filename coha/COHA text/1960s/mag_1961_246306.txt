Man 's genius has devised an impressive variety of electronic brains that solve impressively complicated problems at lightning speeds . Some can be taught to play commendable chess , translate languages ( though poorly ) and compose music . For all their versatility , however , they remain incorrigible simpletons ; before they can solve the simplest problem , their human masters must laboriously explain-in a setting-up process called programing-just what the computers are expected to do . This week Raytheon Co. of Lexington , Mass .. proudly claimed an electronic brain which , according to its developer , can at least profit by its own mistakes . <P> " We have not tried to duplicate the neural networks of the human brain , " says Richard Witt , 35 , chief of advanced development for Raytheon 's communication and data-processing operation . " Rather , we have duplicated the human learning process-experience , trial and error , correlation of new facts with past experience . " The Cybertron K-ioo gets some outside help : it is equipped with a " goof button , " which a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this advice stolidly , the Cybertron thereafter does not repeat the error . <P> One of the machine 's first tests was to distinguish sonar signals bounced off a submarine from those bounced off a porpoise , the ocean floor , or schools of fish . Even an ordinary computer could solve the same problem , but only after a tedious programing telling it exactly how . The Cybertron was merely fed a variety of sounds - several thousand-and after some diligent work by Witt on the goof button , it soon learned to discriminate infallibly . The Cybertron responds by flashing lights on its console , can give not only " yes " ( the submarine ) and " no " ( the porpoise ) answers but a broad variety of " maybes " ( sounds like a sub ) . <P> Cybertron 's adaptive intelligence does not end there . Having learned how to solve a given problem , it slips the answer to a tenacious portion of itself called AIDE ( for Adapted Identification Decision Equipment ) , thus clearing its own mind for further study . AIDE never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the K-100 designed to control traffic , forecast weather , interpret electrocardiograms . Says Dr. Claude Shannon . Donner Professor of Science at MIT : " The Cybertron appears to be an important advance in an extremely important area of research . "
