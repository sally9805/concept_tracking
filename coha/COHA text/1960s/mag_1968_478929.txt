The long , lonely war waged against LBJ by a nearly unknown young Democrat named Allard K. Lowenstein is one of the great political stories of the decade . Lowenstein became a pivot man in the bitter and unfinished struggle to reshape the divided Democratic party , a hero for students and dissident party workers , and a slandered villain for both the Right and the New Left . This is how the battle was fought . The organization of it all , defeating Lyndon Johnson , starts as far back as March 1967 , though few people realized it at the time . It is a period of national malaise ; the country seems to be sucked deeper and deeper into a hopeless war and there seems to be no political alternative to the President in the coming campaign . it is a time of mounting frustration for most Americans . The peace movement seems to be coming to a decisive point ; it is not yet respectable but it is becoming more so all the time . It is not yet a political movement but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the war are hoping to keep the peace movement from becoming too radical and thus searing other more moderate Americans who are uneasy with both the war and with draft-card burning . I am doing an article on Martin Luther King , whose role seems vital in the protest , and I go by to see Allard Lowenstein , an adviser and friend of King 's . Lowenstein , who is playing an increasingly important role in the politics of dissent on the war , spends the lunch talking about the role of the moderate Left in trying to dominate the opposition to the war ; it is going to be people like Norman Thomas ; they are trying to broaden the base of the peace movement . The liberals are badly divided and frustrated at this point . They are largely Democrats , their party is in power , and their party made the war . They are under attack now as they have not been for more than thirty years from people on the Left ; worse , their critics are younger and have more appeal with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young liberals left in the 48 THE MAN WHO RAN AGAINST LYNDON JOHNSON country with any kind of appeal on the campuses , and that appeal stems more from his personal efforts , his interest in young people , his countless appearances on campuses , than it does from his particular political philosophy . Now at this lunch Norman Thomas ' name comes up again and again . " What ! " says Lowenstein aghast . " You 've never met Norman Thomas ? Friday at our house . You 've got to come . Norman Thomas is the most beautiful man in America . " Off we go to Lowenstein 's apartment in Manhattan on Friday . It is an extraordinary evening . Norman Thomas , almost blind , is there , and so is Frank Graham , former North Carolina Senator who was successfully red-baited years ago . With Thomas and Mrs. Roosevelt , Graham formed the trinity of Lowenstein 's political heritage ; they are all people he describes as " sweet , " a word he uses often . Mrs. Lowenstein , young , quite pretty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as about twenty students , none of whom know each other . It is the mark of a Lowenstein gathering that no one knows anyone else , but everyone knows Lowenstein ; they all get together to share the common goal , which is whatever Lowenstein dictates . But Lowenstein is not there . Lowenstein is flying in from someplace where he has just made a rousing speech or two , and he is circling overhead , unable to make the introductions . The students are angry about American life and the war , and they are giving Norman Thomas a very hard time . One of them ? a young girl with Radcliffe-length hair ? is describing the war . Someone points to me and says that what she is saying is n't true and that I was once there . She turns and says , " We do n't give a damn whether you were there or not . " She continues with the argument , pouring it on Mr. Thomas : the war is racial and genocidal , it is the white man deliberately killing yellow men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do it a little more quickly ? Mr. Thomas , frail in all but voice , argues that Vietnam was a mistake , it was too much vanity , it was a nation more proud than wise ; but it was not genocide . The girl continues , getting angrier and angrier : Vietnam is the logical extension of American life . Vietnam was inevitable , given the moral corruption of this country . Again , Thomas argues back : no , it is a mistake , many of the people in charge of this country feel about Negroes the same way you do . This country made a mistake but it is not a racial mistake . Do those generals . the girl shrieks , do those generals feel anything about Negroes ? Yes , says Mr. Thomas . Eventually , as the evening is breaking up . Lowenstein arrives , rumpled as ever . He introduces everyone to the people they have just spent the evening with , and packs everyone off to a West Side reform-club meeting where he then spends half the night attacking Johnson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party of Eleanor Roosevelt , will not permit Johnson to run again . Johnson will be beaten . The politicians are wrong . No one is for Johnson . It is in the air . Volunteers are asked for . A few put their hands up . It all seems very vague , and somehow Lowenstein is hard for me to take seriously ; I have the same reservations about him that I have about Humphrey , that he is somehow intellectually promiscuous , that he jumps around from cause to cause , that all liberal causes are equal , that he is somehow the perpetual student leader , that there is a lack of toughness and discipline in him . We had first met ten years ago in Nashville , Tennessee ; Lowenstein was an old friend of my roommate Fred Graham ( then a law student , now Supreme Court reporter for the New York Times ) . They were friends from Yale , where they used to wrestle ; Lowenstein is a physical cultist , and works out wherever he goes in America . Every town with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that time Graham introduced him as ( a ) the oldest student leader in America , ( b ) someone who knows everyone in America . That image of him has not changed over the years in my mind , though it will start to change now . May 1967 Martin Luther King is speaking at Berkeley on Vietnam and there are 5,000 cheering people in the audience as well as several people sitting in trees for a better look . One of them is Allard K. Lowenstein . He is just in from some California school to the south , he is passing through to give some focus to the dissent on Vietnam . organizing it , channeling it . All the ads that are appearing in the New York Times ? Mister President , College Editors Protest Your War ; Mister President , Student Council Presidents Reject Your War ; Mister President , Peace Corps Returnees Will Not Condone ? are the work of Al Lowenstein . Can we have dinner , I ask . Have to fly off to Oregon , he says . Meetings there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These kids . No one really knows how alienated they are . Trying to keep them in the system is very very hard . They 're bitter and they 're angry . They really resent this society . Of course there are a lot of things in this society that are very resentable . " August 1967 Sitting on the patio of the Continental Hotel in Saigon with John Chancellor , I match his depressing stories about official Washington with my depressing stories about unofficial and official Saigon . A young man , very clean-cut , watches us for about twenty minutes , then comes over , identifies us correctly . and asks , quite surreptitiously , if we have seen Lowenstein . ( Thirteen months later at the Democratic convention Chancellor will recall the moment and refer to the young man as " Lowenstein 's advance man . " ) I saw him in New York , I answer . No , says the young man , he 's here now . Sure enough , several hours later Lowenstein materializes ; it is election time in Saigon and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his team of observers , but he has failed to pick Lowenstein . Al has flown over , Air Lowenstein , to judge the elections , since he intends to criticize Vietnamese politics in the year to come and he does not intend to be one-upped by people asking , were you there ? He is there , though of course observing a Vietnamese election is almost as futile as participating in one . Nevertheless he seems to be known to everyone in Saigon , particularly underground politicians . Lowenstein beavers around Saigon , returns to New York to file a minority report on the elections and continue the embryonic organizational work of the Dump Johnson movement . It still looks like a pipe dream . But protest against the war is constantly growing in America ; the migration is inevitable , always hawk to dove . I remember what Galbraith said about the conversion process : " It 's easier than you think because we believe it and we 've thought it out and they have n't . " Lowenstein is inevitably optimistic ; he is working hard at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early network . At this point the organization is largely Lowenstein and Curtis Gans . The Dump Johnson movement formally began on August 15 with Lowenstein 's speech to the National Student Association , which is his great stomping grounds ; he was the last NSA president before it became tied to the CIA and he has continued to nurse his relationship with the organization , keeping up his contacts and , in the last year , channeling the efforts of its leaders against the war . By August all the NSA leaders ' letters to the President and to Rusk were still unanswered and the feeling of frustration , of being ineffectual , is massive . Lowenstein moves in to direct it to national purposes . " The feeling at that meeting , " says one kid . " was that we had gone just as far as we could go through the normal procedures . They just acted as if we did n't exist , and we were n't serious . And we did n't want to go into the resistance , at least not yet . So we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last stop on the way . " Lowenstein has always been a target of the radical Left ? a symbol of the liberal anti-Communist in their midst ? and their antagonism would intensify in the year to come . Even as he was speaking , the Students for a Democratic Society element of the NSA picketed him with signs reading : " Do n't listen to the CIA Agent Downstairs . " Lowenstein sees the kids as a vital link in any attempt to beat Johnson . He thinks any movement must come from within the Democratic party , and though there are many nominal Democrats opposed to the President , the party apparatus will support Johnson , and labor , increasingly conservative , will also support him . Thus the place of the apparatus and labor must be taken by someone who can energize the ideas , and do the legwork and the dirty work of the movement . What better answer than the kids ? Because of this , the radical Left sees Lowenstein as manipulative , using its contemporaries for his own work , exploiting them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Lyndon Johnson . " Hubert Lowenstein , " one SDS kid will call him a year later . But the meeting goes well ; the kids are ready to try it , to try anything . Lowenstein promises them , somehow , a candidate . The next day he flies to New York to be with Mrs. Allard IC . Lowenstein who is about to have a baby . At 9:00 A.M. , Mrs. Lowenstein starts her labor pains . The doctor assures Lowenstein that the baby will not come until the next day . At 10:00 A.M. , a distraught Mrs. Lowenstein looks up to see Curtis Gans dragging Al off to an organizational meeting in Washington . First things first . " Back by 2:00 P.M. , " he says . Then he catches the shuttle , attends the meeting , and returns to meet his new son , Frank Graham Lowenstein . October 1967 Lowenstein is always ebullient . Probably that 's one of the reasons the New Left does n't like him , just as a lot of liberals now dislike Humphrey for the optimism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark time . Lowenstein is no Humphrey . He sees all the darkness , and sees it as clearly as they do ; but he is resilient , optimistic , and keeps saying that the system can work , which is to them a sign that he does not really mean what he says about darkness , that it is not to him darkness but just a dark issue upon which he can campaign . We have lunch , swapping notes on Vietnam and the campaign . His early organizational days are difficult , yet he is optimistic as ever . The older liberals are also giving him a hard time . The Joe Rauh liberals , " in Lowenstein 's phrase ( Rauh does not think anyone can be to the left of him , says one observer of them both , and Lowenstein , who does not think anyone can be to the left of him , is to the left of Rauh ) , are dubious about the attempt to take Johnson on directly ; they believe it will only enrage the President and make him more intractable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the 1968 convention . ( " When was the last time you heard of rallying millions of people to a plank ? " asks a momentarily amused Robert Kennedy . ) The factional quarrel sim50 THE MAN WHO RAN AGAINST LYNDON JOHNSON ply reflects the extraordinary division within the liberal ranks both because of the war and because of changing goals and values . Some older liberals such as Galbraith are cooperating ; " he was the first major figure in the country who actually encouraged us , " says Lowenstein . Though the war is not going well and no one believes the predictions of the President or the Generals , no one believes either that this has been transmitted to the public . Johnson is the sitting President ; the mythology still holds : the politicians tell the press that the President is invincible , and the press tells the population that the President is invincible , and the politicians read in the press that the President is invincible . Invincibility by mythology . Lowenstein is still looking for a candidate and is convinced he will have one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile , he and Gans have worked out a system . They go into state after state creating their network . Gans compiles the lists of people who might be favorable : ADA lists , names given by friends . Anything for a base in each state . Then Lowenstein appears in a chosen area and holds two meetings , one a private session with the local politicians or political activists who might be favorable and the other a public one . The public one is used to convince the normally nervous politicians . This is , after all , the Democratic party , and at the beginning there is no reason to believe that what Lowenstein and Gans are doing is very much different from the other one thousand quixotic political suicides which are offered to a politician each year . The politicians are nervous at the private meetings , but not opposed . The public meetings , in contrast , usually go much better , with bigger attendance and more enthusiasm than the politicians expect . ( " This is a year , " Galbraith said in August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians are wrong . " ) So the public meetings encourage the politicians . There were several crucial moments early in the campaign , Lowenstein says . One came in Wisconsin . Lowenstein and Gans considered this a particularly tough state because the anti-Vietnam feeling there was violent and had largely been taken over by the radical Left . So the problem was to induce some moderates to move towards the issue . They had the name of Don Peterson of Eau Claire , an ADA board member . Their notes said that he was a good man , the best kind of citizen-liberal , but it would take " one hell of a selling job . " Lowenstein 's first appraisal of Peterson was that he was " nervous but sympathetic , " which was not unusual in those days ; a lot of people were sympathetic but uneasy about a political challenge which might reflect on their patriotism . Lowenstein met with Peterson , taking several hours to explain what he was doing and why . Finally Peterson looked up at him and said very simply , " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to talk to some of my people first . " A few days later he called to say he was in , In Minnesota , they also held an early September meeting ; like Wisconsin , Minnesota was crucial because its convention was an early test ( which would show unexpected McCarthy strength ) . Lowenstein had expected about fifty people at a church meeting and instead found several hundred . Still , the nervousness was there ; an old friend of Lowenstein 's who was a state official told him , " I ca n't be seen with you . But my wife will work for you . And if you can meet me tomorrow privately we can talk a little and I can give you a few names . " After the meeting Alpha Smaby , a member of the Minnesota legislature , signed up ; she had a particularly impressive reputation in Minnesota politics and Lowenstein was elated . She was the first elected public official to come out for them . " Her coming over meant that it was more than the out-left and the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Respectable is a key word and helps separate Lowenstein from the radical Left . Lowenstein still believes in the system , and its limits on dissent . Lowenstein believes that by working through the respectable student leadership , through the middle class , you could most effectively spread the word . He was at his best this way , suitably idealistic . " The Dump Johnson movement was a typical Lowenstein operation , " says one friend who has watched him work over the years . " It was Lowenstein working outside the normal apparatus , functioning almost out of his own hip pocket , using his own personal contacts and his own charisma , not responsible to anyone above him , and influencing people to the right of him . That 's his great strength . talking to these clean-cut young kids , getting them back into the system . He does n't work nearly as well to the left , and he loses his patience ; it 's as if he does n't think people have the right to be to the left of him . Al likes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get revolutionary , he does n't like it . The trouble is , they 're bound to in this country because someone like Lowenstein is trying to work within the system and save it , but of course he does n't have the support of the system . The system does n't give a damn about being saved . So he starts these movements , like the Mississippi Freedom Democratic party , but when they get stalled or bounce off the system the kids get discouraged or become more radical , just like the Mississippi Freedom Democratic party did . And they break with Al and he gets hurt . and they become a little cynical . Now this Vietnam thing , he 's perfectly type-cast for it . There 's no one for outlining moral questions in practical terms and exciting people to the challenge ahead like Lowenstein . But what happens if it fails ? Will you have more disillusioned kids , turned off by the process , thinking Lowenstein fooled them ? " November 15 , 1967 Lowenstein 's candidate will be Gene McCarthy . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Robert Kennedy ; when Lowenstein finally asked him , he said Yes it should be done , but Lowenstein should see Kennedy since Kennedy had a much broader base , an indication of how strongly McCarthy , who actively disliked Kennedy , felt about Johnson and the war ) . Lowenstein , of course , had been in Kennedy 's camp for two years ; Kennedy was clearly the heir apparent for a generation of young men in their thirties and forties who still harbored liberal instincts but who felt that the goals and values of American life had changed . He saw the same darkness that many of these young social critics saw , and his language and his attitude seemed to fit the times : a tough-minded view of the reality of the country , a hope that nevertheless it could still he turned around . Kennedy had sought deliberately that position of leadership , but now in 1967 he was in a particularly difficult position . He was young , he seemed to have a very good chance for a future race , and he was tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a challenge in his own party . If anything , he dominated the party and the area of dissent too strongly at this point . The liberals all waited ; if Robert Kennedy made a move , they would make a move . If he did n't make a move , there would be no move . The Kennedy organization functioned well at the top , many of the brightest and most talented young men in the country were ready to go to work , but there was no grass-roots coalition on issues . One man made it all or broke it all . Here Lowenstein differed ; he was determined to go ahead whether or not Kennedy made the race . They were friends now , though originally very different in their politics . Lowenstein had supported Kennedy for the Senate in 1964 and afterwards had become an informal adviser . a valuable connection to New York reform circles for Kennedy and a valuable reporter for him on what was happening among young people . But in September Lowenstein , who had been urging the race all year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come ; it was past the time of writing magazine articles on the ghetto and making speeches in the Senate on Vietnam ; the army was ready , it would march , the President was ripe to be beaten , it could all be done . The enemies Kennedy would make by running were enemies he already had . The friends he would win were more important , for they would he dominant in American life in the decade to come . By the time of the convention , the party , which was obviously badly shattered , would be very glad he was making the race , but most of all he had to run this year . the issue went far beyond normal party loyalty ; it was a question of moral imperative . Lowenstein , of course , was not the first person to offer Kennedy advice on a 1968 race . In late 1967 almost everyone he met offered him advice , half of them telling him to go , half telling him not to go , and he was caught in the middle . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on social issues , he was getting just the opposite advice from people whose judgment he trusted on political matters , the professionals who were telling him , no it could n't he done , he would destroy himself in the party if he tried . At any rate Kennedy heard Lowenstein out and admired his sincerity and idealism and intensity and then finally , reluctantly , said No , he could not go . he had just talked with Mayor Daley and Chairman X and Governor Y , and they had all said the same thing , you ca n't do it , it 's not your year , you must wait ; we like you , we loved your brother , and we think very-favorably of you for 1972 . And so Robert Kennedy reluctantly passed this on to Lowenstein , saying simply , I 'm sorry , I ca n't do it . Lowenstein had looked at him for a long time and then answered , " The people who think that the honor and the future of this country are at stake do n't give a shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're going to do it and we 're going to win , and it 's a shame you 're not with us because you could have been President . " Then as he left , he said that he was going ahead with the plan and that if Kennedy changed his mind it would be too late , he would not be able to come over . After he lost Kennedy , Lowenstein went to George McGovern , long a leading and articulate dove in the Senate ( " If George McGovern had made the race 1 never would have entered , " Kennedy once told friends ) , a man not well-known nationally because the Kennedys had so dominated the liberal wing of the party . But McGovern had a difficult race coming up in South Dakota ; he did not want to turn Lowenstein down , so he suggested Lowenstein go out to South Dakota for a couple of clays and sample the water and see whether it would be possible to make both races and just what the mood at home was . Lowenstein spent several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposition did not seem strong enough to defeat McGovern , it would make things difficult for him if he were a Presidential candidate as well . He would have to run two campaigns very different in tone and it would eventually be at the least embarrassing and possibly even disastrous . McGovern did not close the door on the race ; indeed he hinted that if no one else would do it , they should come hack to him . Then he suggested Lowenstein talk to Gene McCarthy . Lowenstein did , and McCarthy was ready . He had already thought about the necessity of the race , he sensed some of the changes in American politics , including the fact that , while he lacked national exposure , the exposure would have to come to anyone challenging the sitting President , that you can now make a candidate in about two or three months . He accepted . Gradually there is a change in one 's view of Lowenstein ; he no longer seems the college debater and college stu52 THE MAN WHO RAN AGAINST LYNDON JOHNSON dent council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politically but that somehow you never took that seriously . " I always thought of him , " said one friend of his earlier days . " sitting there in the back of his parents ' restaurant running his various campaigns and organizations . " Rather there is a new toughness and fiber to him ; it is as if the challenge of this particular campaign is worthy of all that energy which up to now was diffused in so many different directions . Now he he seems consumed by his task and somehow toughened by it . The Dream Lowenstein 's political origins were not that different from many others of his generation . He is thirty-nine , son of good upper-middle-class Jews ; he saw the American dream work in his own family ? a family that went from poverty to a decent life while Europe burned ? saw the New Deal transform the sons of immigrant parents , give them respectability ; he believed in the American dream , which worked with sufficient coaxing . That generation believed in certain assumptions of American life , that it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success , yet it had not lost its sense of cause and issue ( which would primarily focus on the question of race in the late Fifties and Sixties ) . In the late Sixties . Lowenstein was , in a sense , a refugee from the New Deal , hoping to make the dream work again . " The spirit of Eleanor Roosevelt hovers over this meeting , " he told one group trying to put together an anti-Humphrey coalition in June 1968 . " We want to regain the country which our civics teachers taught us about , the country that inspired our parents to tell us democracy is the best way to bring about social revolutions . " As a young boy Lowenstein kept a map of Spain on his wall , and he always retained Spanish relief work among his many causes ; indeed , one of the Lowenstein legends among his college friends goes like this : someone calls his house and asks for Al . " Al 's not here , " answers his mother . " He just left for Spain ... you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a long time Lowenstein flitted in and out of liberal causes , sampling reform work in New York , a trip to South Africa , then to Europe to work for Spanish political refugees , integration work in the South , even working for a time for Senator Hubert Humphrey . ( " Al never was too good on Hubert 's staff , " says one friend . " He was always saying yes to every request , putting Hubert 's name on everything , when his job really was to keep Hubert 's name off everything . " ) There was one serious romance during this time with Barbara Boggs ( predictably he refused to give her an engagement ring because he would not support South African mines ) , the daughter of Congressman Hale Boggs , a romance and engagement jeopardized by Lowenstein 's almost spastic travels , and the conservative Catholic Boggs family 's deep-seated opposition ; finally thefamily broke it up . ( The Boggs ' other daughter later married a young reporter for the New York Times named Steve Roberts . Roberts , like Lowenstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand why Boggs was so nice to him . " Then one day realized ? it was because I was n't Lowenstein . " ) During all this time Lowenstein seemed to specialize in causes rather than jobs . In 1961 he taught and served as assistant dean at Stanford ; he left after taking the student side in a student power question . Ile went from Stanford to North Carolina State , where he taught political science for two years and eventually clashed with state authorities over his support of local Negro demonstrations . The head of the state senate told reporters it was disgraceful , North Carolina paying this man $7,500 a year and he 's messing around with the blacks . Reporters called up Lowenstein and he said , yes , it is disgraceful , $7,500 a year is much too little . There was a furor over whether he would be reappointed . Finally he was ; the moment he won the academic freedom point , Lowenstein resigned . " Al was always the moralist , " said someone who knew him well in those days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every issue from the moral point of view . But finally there was some doubt . Was he forcing the moral issue ? Did he always have to see himself in a moral light ? Is there a moral issue in everything ? Or do you create a moral issue in order to keep being fluid , to avoid responsibility and settling down and growing up ? " But another friend from the same era believes the Dump Johnson movement and Lowenstein 's chance to have a Congressional seat will give him what he has always needed in American life , a base and a platform . " Most of the doubts about Al came not so much because of his causes , but because with his causes he had no normal job . He was going against the puritan ethic of American society : A man is talented ? Therefore he should have a job , write a thesis , help his career , work for some Senator , teach , do something from nine to five , and then have his ideals . So people looked at Al and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with causes from nine to five and they had their doubts . But the Dump Johnson thing has given him a national platform already and if he wins the Congressional seat it will be even better . People will be more sympathetic because he 'll have a title and a position , and they 'll be reassured . " December 1967 Lowenstein goes on " Meet the Press , " a rare appearance for someone who is a non-Establishment figure . The interview reflects the general disbelief that he is serious or that the movement can affect anything . Spivak : " Will you support President Johnson if he gets the nomination , or will you bolt the party ? " Lowenstein : " If the President were renominated on his present program and the Republican party offered a candidate who was giving an alternative to what is happening in the war and at home as a result of the war , I would feel my obligation as an American was to support that candidate who gave the best hope of reversing what I consider a policy leading the country toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reasons that the press seems mystified as to what is happening , or regards it as unlikely that this sort of effort would develop , is that it does not yet understand in general the depth of feeling among a great many of us that the country which we love very deeply is heading toward a very serious disaster and that under these extraordinary circumstances our obligation is to find ways of reversing that disaster . If you foreclose the options in politics by saying you can not oppose a sitting President , you can not do this , you can not do that , then the frustration has to spill over into a nonpolitical or nonelectoral protest . . . . I can fully understand why if the political people and the media say you can not reverse the policies through politics , people in frustration may turn to other means and have begun to do so . ...

" January 1968 Al Lowenstein 's life and position are forever complicated . Though the McCarthy campaign is getting minimal attention in most of the press , his backers are beginning to be optimistic ; they are trying to convince McCarthy that the pace is somewhat different from that of a Senate race and they think they are breaking through . But Lowenstein 's position in the campaign is vague . He is still working for the Dump Johnson movement , and the Dump Johnson people have taken over the McCarthy campaign ; people like Gans and Sam Brown who emerged from the early meetings are the key people and so are the kids that Lowenstein helped recruit for the drive , and they will all go into New Hampshire . ( The Kennedys have always wanted McCarthy to enter New Hampshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate instinct was to go into Massachusetts , which he did , and stay out of New Hampshire , which he almost did ; then Lowenstein and a few others put enormous pressure on him , arguing he must make every test , that the very fact New Hampshire is considered hawkish and Wisconsin dovish means that he must go into New Hampshire and do well , otherwise a victory in Wisconsin is meaningless . ) But Lowenstein 's relationship with McCarthy is curiously ambivalent . Part of it is formed by the suspicion within the McCarthy camp that Lowenstein is an agent for Kennedy ( and there is already some very strong anti-Bobby feeling in the McCarthy camp ) . Much of it is a question of style : Lowenstein and Kennedy get along well because they are both basically evangelical , they believe a man can make a difference , that the country can be turned around . McCarthy is quite different .

Lowenstein wanted him to announce his candidacy there , but anti-Lowenstein forces had dissuaded him . Lowenstein , sensing that these people wanted some hope and energy poured into them , some fire to keep them going , pulled out all the stops , and gave a rip-roaring speech about what they were going to do to Lyndon Johnson . McCarthy was appalled . He considered Lowenstein demagogic and he did not like the incendiary quality of the speech .

Possibly when Lowenstein is around , McCarthy senses he is listening to a voice of the Kennedys . Yet Lowenstein is increasingly optimistic . He is convinced that McCarthy has a real chance in every primary ahead and he believes Kennedy will someday have to enter the race . The Tet offensive has hurt Johnson badly . Johnson 's credibility has always been at stake on this war , going back to 1964 when he ran as a peace candidate and then almost immediately expanded the war . The real question on Vietnam which neither Johnson nor the party had faced in 1964 was : all the way in or all the way out ? Thus , immediately after the election Johnson 's credibility began to he doubted by the intellectual judges within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and year by year , that doubt had grown . Johnson , it would turn out , was not a particularly good politician ; he was always willing to maneuver for short-term popularity without sensing the longterm consequences . Every time Vietnam came up as an issue , Johnson would fend off his critics . He would fly to Hawaii . or to Vietnam , or bring a Congressional Medal of Honor winner to the White House , or fly Westmoreland home to talk to the nation and the Congress , and each time he did this it would work : the doves would retreat , healing their wounds , the polls would show the people still loved the President and the war after all . But the price was a dangerously high one ; he was buying time for the war by expending his own personal credibility . When finally the reality of the war , that it was unwinnable , that all the basic American suppositions about Vietnam were fallacious , would surface with a terrible finality , Johnson would be a hollow man . Johnson on his best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the war had ravaged his effectiveness at home and abroad . His much-discussed , much-praised consensus , it would turn out , was a convenient consensus of the moment , not an idea or a consensus of what Americans might be , but rather the parceling out of varying parts of the pie to varying interest groups , good interest groups , bad interest groups , in the hope that this would somehow give them what they wanted and prevent their judging him too harshly on other matters ! Lyndon Johnson had turned out to be a bad politician . That helped Allard K. Lowenstein a lot . April 9 , 1968 , Alabama The impossible has happened : Johnson has been dumped . He has withdrawn , sensing further defeats in future primaries . culminating in California , where his strength is minimal . McCarthy is a handsome victor in Wisconsin . Kennedy is in the race , and most people see Kennedy eventually defeating McCarthy in enough primaries and taking over the leadership of the dissenting Democrats . But for the moment Lowenstein is caught in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instyle , in loyalty . Rumors swirl that he will desert McCarthy fur Kennedy . But Lowenstein invited McCarthy into the race and can not desert him . There are , of course , entreaties . Kennedy is having trouble with the Jews . the liberals , and the kids , and Lowenstein would be an excellent bridge for bringing them back . Kennedy has kids , but as he points out , somewhat sadly , he has the B and C kids and McCarthy has the A kids . There is some talk of a New York Senate race for Lowenstein , if Lowenstein were acceptable to the McCarthy people . " It could he fun , " Kennedy says , we could really shake them up . " But the McCarthy people are dubious and the Senate idea is junked . You running for Congress , " Kennedy says , is like the Pope running for parish priest . " Kennedy suggests a possible job in an Administration . Lowenstein rejects the bureaucracy . Except for one job , he adds . " I know what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where the action is . Yes , nods Lowenstein . But he can not go over to Kennedy though his relationship is strained with the McCarthy camp , particularly in New York where the anti-Kennedy feeling is often as strong as the anti-Humphrey or anti-Johnson feeling . But in late March the rumors have persisted that Lowenstein will defect and Kennedy , hearing them , spots Lowenstein on a bus filled with New York Democrats and asks if it is true . Lowenstein says no . Kennedy retreats to the back of the bus and then scribbles a note to Lowenstein : " For Al , who knew the lesson of Emerson and taught it to the rest of us : ' They did not yet see , and thousands of young men as hopeful , now crowding to the barriers of their careers , do not yet see if a single man plant himself on his convictions and then abide , the huge world will come round to him . ' From his friend , Bob Kennedy . " The loyalty endears Lowenstein more than ever to Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the McCarthy people . Looking for a way out of this bitter split , he decides to concentrate on his own Congressional race , and failing to get a nomination in the city , is invited to run in Nassau County , Long Island . He still works in the McCarthy campaign but it is a loyalty curiously tempered by a basic belief in another man . July 4 , 1968 He is the Democratic Congressional nominee from Nassau County 's fifth district , having won a carpetbagger 's victory-14,881 to 10,908 ? over Albert Vorspan. who is a resident of the district , a candidate with good liberal credentials and the backing of the organization . The Lowenstein victory was put together more on energy than organization . What was notable about it was , first , the rallying of many McCarthy kids , some of whom had become a little disillusioned with McCarthy in recent months , and of Kennedy people who also went to work for him . It was also marked by the appearance of high-school kids . ( Lowenstein 's young people get younger and younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a good thing . ) Lowenstein also organizes the Coalition for an Open Convention in Chicago , a last-minute attempt to bring together the forces that oppose Humphrey and get up some anti-Humphrey momentum . Lowenstein sees Humphrey as much weaker than the delegate counts indicate but propped up by the basic split between the Kennedy and the McCarthy forces . McCarthy is unable to make a real gesture toward the Kennedy people ; he did not like Robert Kennedy in life and he will not say about him in death things he refused to say while he was alive . The Kennedy people , shattered , are largely unable to move toward McCarthy . There are too many bruises and there is too great a difference of style ; the best of the Kennedy people , who might he attracted because of the issues , find no place in the McCarthy campaign for themselves , and McCarthy does not really want them . Kennedy , like his older brother , always had the ability to make intellectuals feel they were of value in the inner circle , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a loneliness and an austerity to McCarthy 's decision making . He is an intellectual . No other intellectuals need apply . Lowenstein 's coalition is an attempt to go to the second- and third-level people in both camps . It is marginally successful at best . The McCarthy people at the top are dubious , regarding it as an attempt to take McCarthy 's campaign and hand the work over to some other candidate ( McGovern Teddy ? ) . Young Mary McCarthy is asked if she 's going to the Chicago organizing meeting . No : " Just one thousand friends of Al Lowenstein at the meeting , " she says . The meeting itself shows again the deep splits . The good Democrats , the middle-aged and even younger people , with whom Lowenstein has worked all year , are strongly anti-Humphrey , but they are Democrats first . and they are leery of a meeting which will offer a resolution calling for a refusal to back Humphrey ; that would tie their hands and hurt them back home . They have already taken a stand which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be read out of the party . For some of the young radicals , however , the Democratic party is at best a passing phase ; they gave it a chance , and look what it did . A fourth party beckons and they are anxious to come out of the meeting with a resolution pledging everyone there not to support Humphrey if nominated . It is the kind of split Lowenstein has faced all year . Then he leaves his position as chairman of the meeting and speaks against the radical motion . He wins and saves the fleeting for the older , more traditional Democrats . But one of his toughest critics , Paul Cowan , whc broke with Lowenstein over their year in Mississippi , rejecting liberalism for radicalism , writes of the meeting : The half-conscious assumption of most of the adults there is that liberals like Eugene McCarthy or Al Lowenstein can contain the new rebels more effectively than Hubert Humphrey , Richard Nixon , or George Wallace . They will encourage people like Reverend Jesse Jackson ISCLC man in Chicago , manager of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caucus to speak ? protect their civil liberties ? hut discourage them from acting out their ideas ? exalt unity to prevent disruption . The McCarthys and the Lowensteins are the most effective champions in the country of the order that the upper-middle-class Americans who support them want to maintain . . . Al Lowenstein , whom the Estahlishment press is billing as the founder of the New Politics , is in fact the ideal spokesman for the new politicians . He is bright enough and brave enough to communicate with the dissident groups his contemporaries fear , and enough of a master of manipulation and persuasion to keep many of the dissenters inside the framework of conventional politics .... Still , Lowenstein and the new politicians who make up the majority of his coalition will be ramembered as sad figures , not as heroic or evil ones . In another year Lowenstein might have been Franklin Roosevelt or Lyndon Johnson , a genius who created a pluralistic consensus and saved the country , or the villain who destroyed democracy by insisting on unity at all costs . But not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healer . No man can play the role for which Lowenstein has cast himself . . . . " August 1965 A Sunday flight with Lowenstein to Manhattan . Kansas , where he will address the annual meeting of the NSA on the first anniversary of the Dump Johnson movement , at a time when the McCarthy movement , despite its earlier victories , looks like a failure . Inevitably we will fly at the least convenient hour and arrive at the least convenient time ; and eating and drinking will be impossible . ( Lowenstein does not care about food and drink . He drinks chocolate milkshakes for breakfast ? fuel ? and has Coke with dinner . ) On the way out we talk about the campaign . A few weeks ago he thought Humphrey could be stopped . But McCarthy has been a little lethargic . The Kennedy people have moved to McGovern , but right now Humphrey is far ahead on arithmetic . A stewardess comes over , excited because there are politicians aboard . She is introduced to Lowenstein , who is a genuine Congressional candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to go to Vietnam to kill some gooks . There are gooks on both sides , he says . That 's tough , she says . We arrive in Kansas City about 1:00 A.M. , are met by 56 THE MAN WHO RAN AGAINST LYNDON JOHNSON five young people , Lowensteinites , college graduates , all part of his great apparatus , all enthusiastic . They are young and clean-cut and they regale him with all the inner gossip of NSA ; it is like being with a star football player when he returns to the campus after a. year 's absence . They are among the handful who organized the Dump Johnson movement a year ago . On the way to Manhattan there is a great review of that historic battle , all very good stuff for me , but it is 4:00 A.M. , New York time , and oppressively hot , and 1 fall asleep . We arrive at the motel . Lowenstein apologizes for my discomfort . Impeccable manners . The next morning we are supposed to meet him at 10:00 A.M. With great effort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three hours later still no Lowenstein ; but his press secretary , Mary Lou Oates , is sighted . She is through with it all , she says . It 's all over , everyone in Kansas is freaking out . It 's the California kids , the California kids , they 're behind it all , they 're way out ahead with drugs and Speed and they 're bewildering these other kids at the convention and making them freak out . There 's no hope . Where is Lowenstein . I ask . I left that job , she says . At 4:00 P.M .. Lowenstein shows up , running , spinning , bouncing off people . " Being a friend of Lowenstein 's , " Jack Newfield once said , " is like being on a hold button on a phone . " Everyone comes running to tell him something urgent . Lowenstein deals in nothing that is not urgent . But the question is , can he still cut it ? He is one of the last great hopes of liberalism . Will even the clean-cut kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the society could work . Did he lie ? Well , everyone is talking about his own personal hang-ups . " A bad sign , " says Lowenstein . " They 're turning inward . When things are going well , they tell you about the political stuff they 're working on . Now it 's all personal . They feel so damn ineffectual . They feel activism is meaningless . They 're all too tired and too beaten out . A year later all they can see is the collapse . They ca n't see what they 've accomplished . . . " Someone runs over to him . " Okay , what 's your problem ? " Lowenstein says . The kid begins by saying , " I hope you have n't come to tell us what we can do and how we can do it because we do n't need any more of that crap , " and ends by telling him , " The only thing to do this year is go for the Congress . " There are surprisingly few McCarthy buttons around , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCarthy buttons than you would expect . Lowenstein spends the afternoon as if at a reunion . In the late afternoon , we go to hear Tom Hayden speak . Hayden is young , tough-minded , a member of SDS , a visitor to Hanoi . He is not a particularly good speaker , but he is revered by the New Left . At the workshop he discusses Chicago plans and needles Lowenstein : " The professional CIA-oriented politicians who occupy one part of McCarthy 's campaign . . . " The New Left is constantly trying to attack Lowenstein as a CIA member . It has no proof . He was the last head of the NSA before its CIA subsidy , yet the attacks continue . ( " I 'm not saying he 's a CIA agent , " said Warren Hinkle in one of the milder radical Left attacks . " But he has to be very naive or very unlucky . .. . " It all has a familiar ugly ring . ) The Yippies say Hayden will nominate a pig for President . The pig will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris for the peace talks . Someone asks Hayden about the possibility of violence in Chicago . " I believe in violence , " he says . " I think this country will change only by violence , but I 'm against it in Chicago because we 're bringing people who do n't know each other onto terrain they do n't blow and the police do know . " That night there is a debate between Robert Scheer , Hayden , and Joe Duffey , a theologian from Hartford who supports McCarthy . Lowenstein chooses not to participate ; he is in a weak position because these kids all want to go to Chicago and McCarthy has come out against demonstrations in Chicago , which binds Lowenstein . Both Scheer and Hayden are annoyed by his copping out . Scheer is an excellent debater , perhaps the best orator of the New Left , dramatic , strong . painting a wide and broad canvas of American evil staining the world . He says , " Without the radical peace movement there would have been no McCarthy campaign . We forced them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al Lowenstein going to support Hubert Humphrey ? " ( In the audience Lowenstein whispers , " He makes his living off me . He told the students earlier that he came here only because I told them not to go to Chicago . " ) If McCarthy comes out and says Wait until 1072 , then nice a man as he is , he sold you out . " There are several more attacks upon McCarthy and the campaign . In the audience Lowenstein whispers , " All year the radical Left said , do n't go into the McCarthy movement . It 's a plot to make the peace movement look weak . Now they want sympathy for how well they did , even if cheated because the system ca n't work . They want it both ways . " Now Hayden is saying that the situation will soon be one " when you will have to decide whether to be a good German or not . No candidate for President will be safe to speak in this country . . . . " Later Lowenstein speaks . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up being set for midnight . So at midnight , with Scheer and Hayden and a determined delegation of SDS kids in his audience , Lowenstein begins to total up the board on the year to see what they accomplished . They ended the " inevitability of Lyndon Johnson 's election and we might have clone more except for June fourth . We did it without a major name , money , or the mass media . We showed that the system is not so resistant to change but that it is badly corroded . Now , however , we know more about what we 're dealing with . . . . Even the most recalcitrant of leadership has become more responsive on Vietnam . Hubert Humphrey found out that he always agreed with Robert Kennedy on Vietnam . " Then , as he is speaking , the SDS people put on what is called guerrilla theater . Someone tagged " Big Daddy " ( the Left 's nickname for Lowenstein ) plays a recorder and invites a bunch of kids on to Chicago . The students arrive , do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in khaki . Lowenstein stops and waits until the pageant is over . " The kids who went to Chicago were just machine-gunned by someone from SDS , " he says . Applause . " But on the basis of past experience , they will recover . " The intensity of feeling against Lowenstein among the New Left is really astonishing . It is very deep and very bitter ; he is probably their foremost enemy . In a generation where liberalism is weak on the campus and they are so strong , Lowenstein is one of the last effective liberals competing with them , and thus a very real target . He continues : " The McCarthy people turned around public feeling on the war , made the opposition to it respectable , and only a small minority in the country now believes it can be won . This is the last stand of decaying institutions which have not met the needs of time . So that despite the enormity of your disappointment and my disappointment there are still some positive signs . The exalting fact is that ordinary people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and future of their country and they did and out of this will come the kind of America we want . " A series of questions follow , mostly about whom he will support . He does n't think it will he possible to support Humphrey . " Is there a chance you will support Humphrey ? " someone asks . " Extremely remote , " he says . " So we wo n't be surprised if you do , " says the same student . The questions continue . Have American values caused Vietnam ? Is Vietnam just a moral extension of America ? Lowenstein grapples with it . " What we have in this country is the miseries of abundance , " he says . " It is here that liberalism has been a failure . We grew up , a generation of us , with the assumptions of liberalism , that when you got rid of poverty and injustice you were happy . But that is not true , people are not more happy . " The questions continue to come in , largely from the SDS kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confession of failure , and finally Lowenstein responds : " The problem with radical rhetoric is that it 's very good , it 's the best rhetoric there is in assessing liberal failures . It 's very accurate there . But then with their own programs they give little more . As much as we liberals have failed and 1 think our failures are obvious now , I do n't see any easy alternatives . We did change some things , we learned some things , and the fact that Bob Kennedy was murdered and Gene McCarthy was disorganized does n't show me by David Halberstam .3 that the system wo n't work . " He finishes and as he leaves the podium he is joined in a semi-debate by Hayden and Scheer ; they want him to tell the kids to go to Chicago ( " But do n't you want to prove that it 's a rigged convention ? " asks Scheer innocently ) . They keep pushing him on this , reminding him that he had been in previous demonstrations , and finally Lowenstein , exasperated , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't have any programs . I can see events where I 'll be as much a part of the resistance as you are . I hope it does n't happen . But I do n't think the final evidence is in that we 've lost everything we started out to do and that we ca n't get out of the war . I think with the removal of Johnson they will understand the political crush of the war and they 're opportunistic enough to get out . " But Hayden and Scheer think that in discussing the success of the Dump Johnson movement Lowenstein has underestimated the role of the Vietcong and the Tet offensive . " You 're leaving out the Tet offensive , " Hayden says , " the fact that the war was unwinnable . " Lowenstein answers , " That 's just it . We did n't have the Tet offensive when we went in last November but we went in anyway . " Friday , August 23 , 1965 Lowenstein arrives in Chicago , a city swelteringly hot and filled with police . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Biafran pin . " They come and ask you and you ca n't turn them down . You ca n't say , ' This year I 'm busy , come back in a year when my own country is less turbulent . ' " He is in Chicago juggling his many roles : McCarthy pioneer , Kennedy scout , Congressional nominee , aging student leader , possible New York delegate , and white liberal with considerable black contacts . ( He is a board member of Dr. King 's SCLC . Since almost every other board member is a black Baptist minister , he was first listed on their programs as Reverend Allard Lowenstein . He called up a staff member to correct it and point out that he was Jewish . The next time he was listed as Rabbi Allard Lowenstein . ) Mostly he is part of a loose coalition which is trying to stop Hubert Humphrey . Nominally that coalition is pro-McCarthy but there is the belief that in the week of the convention McCarthy will behave as he has in the last three weeks , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the vacuum , and thus that it will not be McCarthy . Earlier in August McCarthy went to Maine for a five-day vacation with the omnipresent Robert Lowell . Kenneth Curtis , the Democratic Governor of Maine , who was wavering on Humphrey , had been softened up and was waiting for a phone call , perhaps even a meeting . It was a great five days but they never called the Governor . Now a strategy emerges : hold for McCarthy and McGovern as best you can , unite on a peace plank , try and force a split between Humphrey and Johnson on their Vietnam 58 THE MAN WHO RAN AGAINST LYNDON JOHNSON position , hope the alliance shatters , and then start picking up the pieces , holding Humphrey off on a first ballot . Behind all this is the hope that Ted Kennedy can be nominated . There are some indications from Hyannis Port that under certain conditions it might be done . It would have to be a draft of sorts and it would have to be delicate . The Kennedy people are not particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the open for the Presidency , miss it , and then feel the steel trap of the Vice Presidency snap around their man . Lowenstein is committed to McCarthy as long as McCarthy has a chance , but it is quite clear that most of the McCarthy people have given up hope ; McCarthy has his part of the convention but it is not likely to grow . Lowenstein goes off to see some Negro leaders , particularly the Reverend Jesse Jackson . Jackson is perhaps the man in the King organization most likely to fill the leader 's place , perhaps even the prototype of a. new Negro leader iu the North . He is young , handsome , dynamic , a fine fiery speaker , sort of Afro-mod-Baptist . Jackson had been leaning toward Humphrey ( as were many older and more traditional Negro leaders ) , for McCarthy 's failure to touch the nerve in the ghetto was a significant failure of his campaign ; he simply refused to talk in a different Lone , with more passion and more concern to any segment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps even deserved it , but he believed that there were not twenty-five different kinds of Americans ; he felt his record and what he was saying on the ghettos were enough . But they wanted passion and tangible signs of concern ; they were not white America ; their problems were greater and they would not be addressed in the same low key as white America . But now Rev. Jackson is shifting back toward McCarthy . Part of it is enormous pressure by the Kennedy-McCarthy people on Jackson , plus intense pressure on McCarthy to go and talk with Rev. Jackson 's people . He is considered crucial ; for though he is not well-known in the white political world , he may well be the most prestigious black still working inside the system . His credibility is great and his endorsement would be of immense value . He has been cool toward McCarthy , feeling the reservations that many Negroes feel : but about a month before the convention McCarthy had met with him and spoken to his church , one of the few times the McCarthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now do n't you go out there and condescend to my people . Do n't you talk down , " Jackson had told him . " You just go out and drop your load . " It had gone well and Jackson 's estrangement from Humphrey was intensified . Now on Friday night he was telling Lowenstein that he was thinking of endorsing McCarthy . " Hubert Humphrey is a grape of hope that has been turned into a raisin of despair by the sunshine of Lyndon Johnson , " he said . Saturday , August 24 , 1968 The question is : will Allard K. Lowenstein be on the New York delegation ? At present he is not . thanks to an extraordinary amount of internal shuffling and bickering among people , since he has been a particular thorn to them all year . But now , under national exposure , it is becoming more difficult to keep Lowenstein off the delegation . He is a national figure within the party and an explosive , articulate speaker , one of the major critics of the war , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning there is pressure to put him on the delegation . Lowenstein finds it all very funny . " Even Humphrey is going around saying he wants me on the delegation , " he says . " There 's a conga line . They 're all on it . They all really want to keep me off the delegation . But they also want to make sure that someone else gets the blame . " Almost anyone else would he annoyed by all this shuffling around ; not Lowenstein . He enjoys it . It means more intrigue , more meetings pro , more meetings con , more wheeling and dealing . He loves the wheeling and dealing as much as he loves the moral issues . " Al is a political nymphomaniac , " a friend says . Sunday , August 25 , 1968 Allard Lowenstein the cheerleader : spreading good cheer , optimism , and hints of Teddy Kennedy . The McCarthy people are gloomy and depressed ; at caucuses the hint that Kennedy might be willing to run brings a marked change in the atmosphere , a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of stopping Humphrey . Lowenstein feels that the direction of the convention is good ; there is an easing of the bitterness between some of the Kennedy and McCarthy people on the peace plank and a growing awareness of the problems the Humphrey people have trying to get out from beneath Johnson 's vanity on Vietnam . But there are problems everywhere . " Some of the P McCarthy people are going around pleased because they think Unruh is for them . But the opposite is true . If he 's for them it 's a sign he thinks the game is over and he just wants to make his own separate peace with the California peace people , tidy up his lines for the next Governor 's race . If he holds , that means there 's a chance , " Lowenstein says . There are also myriad problems in Chicago . The phone system has broken down completely , with an assist from Mayor Daley and Illinois Bell ( Daley 's motto is no communications is good communications ) . In the lobby of the Hilton there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They rarely work . " It 's all electronic but they get overheated and burn out , " laughs the desk clerk . Lowenstein spends the morning darting in and out of meetings , trying to keep troops in line , and most of it is spent at a Coalition for an Open Convention meeting where fourth-party rumblings are more than rumblings . They are ready to march , people like Marcus Raskin of the Institute for Policy Studies , and Sanford Gottlieb of SANE . But there is a defeated quality to the meeting . Everyone is physically and emotionally spent . They have run out of money , and out of unpaid volunteers , and out of gas . Lowenstein tells them they are 816,000 in the hole , " but it 's really much more . " A good many people at the meeting want to break out of the party right now and issue their fourth-party statement . " This party means nothing , " one of them says , " and the sooner we get on with electing Richard Nixon the better . You people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is over . So let 's start working for a new party and 1970 and 1972 . " Someone gets up and says the only problem about the fourth party is whether to draft McCarthy right now or wait until after the convention , Otherwise we let all the discontent with Humphrey and Nixon get funneled to Wallace , and the politicians will read all the wrong signs from what happened during the year . " Lowenstein holds them off . " If we do this now it 'll be like issuing a statement saying McCarthy ca n't win . It will be an admission of defeat and it will strengthen Humphrey and I do n't think we 're defeated yet . " He holds them off ; a decision is delayed until after the convention . We drive off to another meeting of McCarthy people . Raskin rides with us . He is talking about his new party , " the young third-tier labor leaders , and the radical farmers . " It sounds very far away . The next meeting reflects more of the same frustra- tion : how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they protest too much , wo n't that solidify the Humphrey people ? McCarthy disdains leadership while these people spin around in the vacuum . They do n't know where to go and who is to lead them , Lowenstein gives brief advice and hustles off to lunch with Ronnie Dugger , the Texas liberal . To Dugger , Lowenstein delivers a long lecture on the liberal possibilities of Amarillo . Amarillo . The possibilities are very great , it seems , and have long been neglected by other Texas liberals . " All over Amarillo they kept asking me , Why does n't someone come up and integrate us with that liberal crowd from Austin . " The subject of the fourth party comes up . Lowenstein is edgy about it . When he was running out on Long Island the Liberal party heard he might favor a fourth party and it called him in to question him about this and other stands he was taking . " How do you feel about fourth parties ? " one of the Liberals asked him . Some have done very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he answered . There was a gasp . Lowenstein was turning out to be just as bad as they had heard . " Which ones ? " he was c sited . " Well , for example , the Liberal party , " he said . By Sunday evening it has become somehow clear that a Humphrey nomination will not bring sad tidings to just Waverly , Minnesota , but that it may well mean a disaster of consummate magnitude , bringing down the party 's best Senatorial and Congressional people , purging the state house of Democrats , costing the towns their aldermen " and many of our best dogcatchers , " in the bitter words of one Kennedy backer who had been warning all year of this and was now being believed . " There must be about three or four Humphrey people who 've come up to me and told me that I was right about Humphrey and the fact that he would n't be able to change back to the old Humphrey overnight . " The polls reflect Humphrey 's weakness ; but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the six weeks that he has been campaigning he has not caught fire because he can not catch fire . His style is hopelessly outdated , and he does not , can not perhaps . sense the new styles , the new issues and the seriousness of the objections to him . There is talk about Mayor Daley wanting Teddy ; Daley is clearly unable to go for McCarthy . He may be better in the polls and he may even be a winner , and Daley likes winners above all else , but he is just too irregular , too unpredictable , he does not know the language . Today Daley and Illinois caucus and delay their decision three days , which starts an escalation of rumors . This makes an interesting situation because of Daley 's dual power . His police are already behaving like thugs and pushing everyone around , but everyone is quiet about it ; the Kennedy , McCarthy , and Humphrey people , because his votes are still too important . He may be an SOB , but he can deliver the convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on Teddy , he appears to be playing an interesting game . He is hinting at it , without committing himself . Daley and Jesse Unruh meet , spreading even more rumors . Lowenstein starts to grow more and more optimistic . That night , on the way to dinner , he is interrupted by a man from Wyoming who comes over to introduce his wife . " This is the fella I told you about , Margaret . The one who came out last year and made that speech about Johnson . Said it could be done and by God he was right . Well , young fella , you 're all right . " Lowenstein protests that it is people like the man from Wyoming who did it . He is growing euphoric : Teddy seems ready to go . " Everyone will now act according to character . Johnson will try to screw Humphrey , because he 's Johnson . That coalition will shatter . McCarthy will hold his strength but not pick up . Then they will turn to Teddy . " Monday , August 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Draft Teddy . Done so quickly they are made of paper . Dick Tuck , the prankster , is distributing Humphrey-Connally buttons designed to terrify the liberals 60 THE MAN WHO RAN AGAINST LYNDON JOHNSON that are left in the Humphrey camp . Lowenstein is chasing from caucus to caucus . The New York caucus is a particular zoo . It is filled with reporters and hangers-on , nearly doubling its size . So they ask all non-delegates to stand up and no one stands up . So they ask all delegates to stand up and everyone stands up . So they make everyone leave the hall , then let them back in , one at a time , delegates only . So the caucus starts , three hours late . Lowenstein heads for still another private meeting and I slip downstairs to have lunch with three McCarthy friends , upper-middle rank . The conversation is filled with the kind of love-frustrationanger which has marked the entire McCarthy campaign . While caucus after caucus of varying states are dying to see him , he is aloof and proud ( he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the convention , to storm in and flex some might , some polls , and some determination in caucus after caucus is ebbing . Some of his people in these delegations are pleading with him to give it one more try ; the Humphrey thing is coming unstuck . But he can not do it . Those qualities about McCarthy , observable early in the campaign , the loner , the individualist , the mocker of the American system , have now hardened . There is the quality of brilliance when he wants to be brilliant ; at his best there is no one quite like him in American politics , his very detachment allows him to soar above the pettiness and the old blocs and to talk of real visions , of appeals to individual conscience . But there is arrogance bordering on perversity and more , the pride , the ferocity , the refusal to do anything he disdains , even if it is for a larger end . He did not like Robert Kennedy while alive , he will not say anything gracious about him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delegation he needs , in a private meeting , a Kennedy delegation , and not mention Robert Kennedy 's name . Nor will he glad-hand . Or pander . Every man chokes on something ; Eugene McCarthy chokes on pride . So now at lunch the varying McCarthy stories are being told , told in the frustration and the irritation and the numbness of this convention . " He took us a long way . He went alone and we went a long way with him , " one of the people says . " He gave us back something of ourselves . " But another interjects : " Yes , he took us a long way . But he screwed us . We gave him a lot . We invested a lot in him , a hell of a lot of us . He owed us more than he gave us , It was n't enough . Oh sometimes he even laughed at us . " " I 'm not going to leave this thing bitter , " the first man says . " He took us further than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we be like this week if we were here and he had n't tried ? How would we feel about ourselves ? Look , you ca n't expect him to change . lie 's this kind of man . That 's all there is . He is n't going to change for you . For him this convention is like taking out the garbage . " " But it is n't changing for us . It 's changing for the issue which brought us all into it . " Then a quick discussion on how McCarthy views man : he does not believe man is perfectible . He thinks man has failings , and God looks down from on high and maybe good things can be done and maybe they ca n't and you ca n't push it too far . A Kennedy man with a touch of bitterness suggests that it is too bad that McCarthy had such a protective press at the end ; that the warts on Bobby were always exposed , but that McCarthy 's weaknesses were often hidden , discussed only in the inner circle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first man , " I 'm not going to feel badly about what was written about Bobby . Gene went in first and he did the right thing . Some of the things you 're complaining about , kissing this ass , and kissing that ass , going to this caucus , are going to look pretty damn small fifty years from now and a lot of the things he did are going to look pretty damn big if anyone 's left around to judge . " We discuss the security situation . It is oppressive . Security is unpleasant in the first place , no one likes it ; but the better the security people are , the quicker and more clinical they can make their job . But this is another thing . Daley 's people , particularly his plainclothesmen , are pushing everyone around . The Mayor is clearly mounting a disaster ; he does not think the Yippies have the right to protest , since they are not in the party . ( In the middle of the Ribicoff demonstration , when RibicotT came of age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daley 's people . fourth row of the phalanx , turned to another and said . " He ai n't so much ; I hear he ai n't even organization . " s Worse , they do not have votes . So there is no point in compromising with them , giving them Soldiers Field . Daley looks at them and gets angry ; he listens and it is worse . It is all changing so fast . ( When one of his chief deputies in a suburban area lost his area to a peace candidate , Daley was perplexed : What went wrong ? Was the garbage collected ? Did they need garbage pails ? ) There is something ominous about the entire police setup , the vast hordes of them around the Hilton , the arrogance of them at the Amphitheatre . Lowenstein , for instance , was arrested and detained for more than thirty minutes because he walked in with a copy of the New York Times ; he was creating a fire hazard , it seems . Tuesday , August 27 , 1968 A convention is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not a matter of who is the best-informed person , or the best-organized , or the most creative ; it is a matter of who functions best at 2:00 A.M. , who bears best the lack of sleep . At 3:00 A.M. everyone is still trying to react to the events of the previous day , or more accurately , the rumored events of the previous day . Better men may have fallen , the way is open to those men of greater endurance . ( " This all would n't have happened , " Robert Kennedy once said of the choice of Lyndon Johnson as Vice President , " except we were all too tired last night . " ) Everything is disorganized ; either one has not eaten at all , or one eats lunch three times as a means of seeing three different sets of people . There is a sense of touching everything and touching nothing ; one is at the center of action and yet feels that the action must be elsewhere . Are you at the convention hall ? Then the action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yippies ? Then it must be at the hall . If you are with McGovern , then it must be with McCarthy . New York ? Then with California . Lowenstein naturally thrives on this . The rest of the world has come round to his way of living . He lives like this all the time and he is at home here , spinning off people , wheeling and dealing . ( " God , am I glad to see you . I 've been looking all over ... " And then he sees someone else over this person 's shoulder , breaks contact , and rushes off . ) He is surrounded by coteries of young men . Can they all be student-hody presidents ? He dispatches them on their many missions of mercy , one to look for James Wechsler , the New York Post columnist , and to hold him ( " he 's rather short and wears bow ties . . " ) , one to call Dick Goodwin 's room , one to find Mark Raskin , one to find chocolate malts , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to the Amphitheatre that night he is optimistic and getting more so . The tough Vietnam plank dictated from Washington that Humphrey has accepted does not bother him . " Clarifies the convention . It 's clear now . Connally is Humphrey 's Thurmond . Humphrey 's going to pay a heavy price for this . " He is fairly optimistic about the peace plank , supposed to be voted on that night . The Teddy boomlet is still in the background but it is surfacing fast now . Events are starting to get ahead of themselves . Behind Lowenstein 's optimism is the belief that Teddy will accept a draft under certain conditions , and he senses that those conditions will be met , that McCarthy will make the move . The thirst for Teddy , the craving for him is very real and it reveals , if nothing else , the party 's bankruptcy ( the fact that it has the sitting President is largely disguised here ) . It is badly torn , disorganized , factionalized , and its leadership is largely in the past ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on issues that are increasingly irrelevant ; in the cities where new reputations might be made , the Democratic leaders are more often than not tied to corrupt , corroded machines , or at least neutralized by the machines . The party looks for fresh blood ; it finds a thirtysix-year-old Kennedy . The Teddy boomlet reflects the desperation of the moment . Teddy rumors swirl , from the floor to TV , back to the floor , then fed back again to reporters . In a press room , a reliable friend grabs me , and says , " Teddy 's on his way here , I know it and that by David Halberstant G1 is a fact " ; whereas , of course , Teddy was on his way at that moment across his Hyannis Port living room . Meanwhile there are other rumors . McCarthy has conceded . Around the hall it goes . McCarthy concedes . Someone in the McCarthy camp is screaming , How can he do this to us ? Goodwin is holding a press conference to deny it . On the floor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convention goes its dreary way , two different worlds swirling around each other , the old one , used as a base from which the modern electronic one can operate . The floor seems to be quieting down . One senses that the Teddy boomlet is ebbing . Kennedy will once again ask that his name not be presented . Late this night , I have drinks with an old friend . What are you doing , he asks me . Covering Lowenstein , I answer . " Oh that guy , " he says . " Is n't he the one who 's been working behind the scenes for Terry Sanford for Vice President ? " Wednesday , August 28 , 1968 The Teddy boomlet died last night , and the reasons are still a matter of some confusion . McCarthy met with Steve Smith , who was serving as Teddy 's eyes here . Both sides have different versions of what happened What is clear is that they talk different languages ; the Kennedys ' is sharp , blunt .. McCarthy more opaque , more mystic . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does say . McCarthy gave what he felt were clear and present signals . Stephen Smith did not thus interpret them . Probably had he spent the entire year as a McCarthy lieutenant he would have understood that McCarthy was implying that he knew he could not win and he was releasing his delegates , if they wanted him to . They thought that somehow he was insisting upon a pure and complete draft and for them to make the first step . In addition , word of the meeting soon leaked out ; it was bound to ; Chicago for a week is a city without secrets . But the Kennedys , who were very edgy about this whole thing , believed McCarthy had deliberately leaked it , as a means of making the whole thing messy . The leakage did make the thing messier , and above all the Kennedys did not want a messy fight . They really did not want the nomination at all . They did not think this would be a particularly good year , they were still shattered from the assassination , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Teddy to go , to save the party , was intense , and growing stronger all the time , and the Kennedys are not great waiters . Given an option of waiting their normal turn for some race , as everyone else has done , and going at a precocious age against all normal odds and tradition , they will go fo-r it . If it could be done quietly and sprung at the last minute they would accept ( it really would have been a draft ) , sensing that despite all the factionalism , their young fresh face could defeat Richard 62 THE MAN WHO RAN AGAINST LYNDON JOHNSON Nixon 's stubble-lined face in a close race . The role of Daley in all this is at best devious . He was a figure in it ; he did in a way encourage the boom-et by holding back on Sunday . Yet when it seemed ready to go ( and it would have gone ; Teddy Kennedy was very nearly nominated in the party 's desperation ) he quickly moved to deflate it . Daley later claimed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course he knew Kennedy would not do . The more likely explanation , and one believed by the Kennedy people , is that Daley was trying to flush Teddy out in the open and then spring the Vice Presidency on him , having first proven his availability . Either way Daley would have emerged as the kingmaker . Teddy did not bite ; the young Irish are as shrewd as the old Irish . With Teddy goes the last of Lowenstein 's hopes . The night before . he was elated , the impossible seemed possible ( " the greatest miracle of our time is about to happen , " he told one friend who needed a little bucking up ) . Now he lacks both the votes and the candidate . Even the peace plank is in trouble . Though the Administration plank is hardline and Humphrey is swallowing it , the Humphrey people have come up with a slick defensive move , an amendment to the main plank put up by more moderate Humphrey forces ( Clark Kerr , Victor Reuther , etc . ) . Anxious to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healed , they are now pre-selling their amendment , which is more dovish than the Administration position . The idea is that the Administration position goes through and then the Humphrey forces join the peace forces and come up with the good moderate position . Some of Lowenstein 's people have been saying that the amendment looks good and he is trying to hold the line . " I spent two years of my life fighting this . We did n't want it then , and we do n't want it now . " he tells a Negro woman . " I 'm not going to give these people respectability . Tell them they wo n't have our votes . Tell them they can get their votes from Texas . " It is the first time I have seen him angry . The proposed moderate amendment has changed the basic balance on the Vietnam plank ; some big states , such as Ohio , Michigan , and Pennsylvania , which might have gone for the peace plank are now swinging the other way . " They wo n't have our votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hawk amendment , " And the moderate amendment never conies to a vote ; its sponsors realize they can not bring the peace people around . It takes the steam out of the peace plank . It will now go down to defeat . Now , steadily , the entire convention becomes a scenario of the party 's bankruptcy . Even in the Vietnam plank debate the emptiness is obvious . Most of the men arguing for the peace plank have been silent for four years , brought to the podium now to rekindle the Kennedy flame ; they are men like Theodore Sorensen who felt in March that the issue was not worthy of Bob Kennedy making therace . It is one more sad note for the party that even here , among its dissenters , there is little in the way of fresh young leadership . One listens to Sorensen and senses that in some ways the radicals are right , that the Cold War put the liberals of this country too much on the defensive , that for some the price paid in fending off the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proving one 's basic anti-Communism , took too much out of them . In the years the Democrats have been in power ? and thus in a sense the liberals ? the power of the Pentagon has grown to the point where it is to a younger generation the issue of American life . One senses that one era is ending for the party ; perhaps slowly , in the embers here , another is beginning . There is no guarantee of it . At almost the same time , Daley 's police unleash themselves against the Yippies , cracking heads indiscriminately . It is , like the convention itself . a symbol of the inability to handle real problems . The Yippies have come here and failed ; their turnout was far below what they expected and needed . The radical Left accuses Lowenstein of manipulation , though of course that is their own game : manipulation and provocation . And who in Chicago have they manipulated ? Why Richard J. Daley , of course . For it is true that they have shouted foul words in unison and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse , even against the Mayor . And the Mayor . the Mayor whose face turns red at off-color stories and who does not like his deputies to play around ( though alcohol is a permitted vice , indeed almost an expected sign of weakness of the flesh ) , the Mayor sent the cops after those kids . He would show them ; if their protests were meant to provoke , why , the Mayor would honor that protest , he would be provoked . If the Democrats had shown that they could no longer cope with the country , the Mayor would use their convention to prove it . All of this has taken place while Hubert Humphrey is being nominated . The dream of all those years coming home , finally so tarnished , and Humphrey was unable to stop it , or worse to try to stop it at least ; to say something . He was offering himself , he would deal with Brezhnev and de Gaulle and the Joint Chiefs though he is too weak and eroded to deal with Daley even of ter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling Muriel that he could not understand why the young no longer loved him and why the liberals had turned on him . On the floor Lowenstein is trying to get to the podium to make a motion to adjourn until the city does something about the police ( an interesting motion which , given the anger of delegates , might have carried ; enough had been roughed up by then ) . In the New York delegation , John Burns refuses to let him use the microphone ( which is probably not turned on anyway ) so he has to go to the podium . But no one can get near the podium . The Illinois delegation blocks it , and the Illinois delegation is blocked by great circles of plainclothesmen . As Lowenstein moves forward he is hemmed in by the plainclothesmen . They refuse to let him move forward . " I 'm a delegate from New York trying to make a motion , " he says . " No , you 're not , " one says . " You 're not going to make a motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sonny . Be a good boy . Push off . " one of them says . " There are federal agents here and they know what you 're doing and you 're going to be in trouble . " As he leaves the floor he is grabbed by a New York reformer , an angry one . " Why is n't Teddy being put in nomination ? " " Because the big shots do n't want it , " he answers . " The big shots did n't want Lyndon Johnson beaten and it did n't stop you . Why do n't you do something ? " she screams at him . " I do n't know who appointed me Jesus Christ . Is n't there anyone else here ? " Later he is grabbed by a series of television reporters , and he gives them something . To one : " This convention elected Richard Nixon President of the United States tonight . That 's like electing Arthur Goldberg Mayor of Cairo . I never thought it would happen . " On it goes ; he heads toward a final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet , pledge themselves to come back again , and then hold a candlelight walk back to the city . ) As he goes off to the caucus , the fatigue finally showing . I remember what Ronnie Dugger said about him , recalling a visit Lowenstein made to Texas last August . " He did n't even have a candidate at that time . But he came down and he was organizing and putting it together , telling us it could be done , that we were not alone . That was very important , that we were not alone . And then I remember taking him to the airport afterwards and watching him walk up the ramp , and I thought , my God , there goes one man trying to take on the entire system alone , and I felt a certain chill . It was pretty damn impressive . " Thursday . August 29 , 1968 The full recognition of what has happened spreads all over the city ; if there is one thing that binds people here , it is a desperate urge to get away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention , Mr. O'Dwyer ? asks a radio reporter , shoving his little beeper at Paul O'Dwyer , and O'Dwyer , bless him , does not analyze the role of the Left , or the Right , or the Center ; he says very simply , " It 's a horror . " ) Even Lowenstein is dejected . He runs around from meeting to meeting , arguing fourth parties and Vice Presidential nominations ( shall they use nominations for the Vice Presidency as a means of attacking the convention ? ) . But it is all gone . He is still bothered about whether or not he should have put Kennedy 's name in nomination , even without the great powers ; he is convinced that the support was there , that they could have done it without . Daley . But can you inflict the nomination on a man who does not seek it , the surviving son of a tragedy-riddled family in such a particularly violent year ? No , you ca n't , he thinks , and then he talks about all that was riding on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone into it , what the consequences may be , and be is uneasy . In the afternoon , McCarthy 's farewell and it is excellent . He is at his best : But what of the great issues which we raised ? the war and the question of priorities for this nation ? Because that was the substance of our commitment . The other reforms of procedure and process and party were secondary . It would appear that we lost on the platform fight . And in a quantitative sense , any kind of numerical measure , you would have to say that we did lose at this convention . But that was not the measure of the judgment which was passed in this country . So what we can do is go on to continue to present to the people as best we can for judgment between now and November the issues we have been raising for nine months in this country . . . I think that the outlook is one that must be reassuring : one of confidence and of optimism ? not really of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exist in the minds and in the hearts of the people of this country . I think we can say we were willing to open the box and to see what America was . We had that kind of trust and that kind of confidence . And when we opened it , we found that the people of this nation were not wanting . " It is very good stuff ; he is speaking extemporaneously and yet the words have a precision and a finality to them . They will be around a while . I mention this idea to a boy who has worked all year for McCarthy . And the kid says , " He 's a great loser . " Then downstairs to wait for Humphrey 's press conference . He will announce his Vice President . He is forty minutes late , and this is a busy day . We are all restless . I ask one reporter who covers him if he 's often late . " He 's always late , " says the reporter . " He 's incompetent . He ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone he 's already convinced . " McCarthy said of him yesterday in a long interview with the Chicago Deily News : " Hubert 's all right on decisions . He usually makes good ones . It 's when he starts to talk that anything can happen . I remember in 1954 when everyone was talking about the new Humphrey and how mellow and tempered he was . And he went out to speak to a labor group in Ohio and suddenly it 's in the papers about Ike being a canary in a gilded cage while back in the kitchen the blackbirds were eating up the public pie , and upstairs everyone was sunny and light , while downstairs in the cellar there were white creepy crawly things everywhere . So I asked him , ' Hubert what happened to the new Humphrey ? ' and he answered : ' I heard the whistle blow . ' " Tuck 's parody and satire paper claims that Humphrey will nominate Agnew " to dispel the reports of the Eastern Establishment press that there are serious differences between him and Nixon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the " most exciting and challenging race since Franklin Roosevelt . " I am nervous but the lightning fails to strike . Thursday night , riding to the convention hall , the impossible happens . Allard K. Lowenstein ? after 18 months of 2,367 speeches in 1,392 cities , 70 per cent of them under 50,000 population , 288,021 miles of travel , and 678 missed meals ? has laryngitis . He can not talk . He writes messages to friends . He has a sprayer for his throat . His aides have asked the TV commentators what they use for their throats and the answer is nothing . Nevertheless he sprays and swallows . His wife , Jenny , finds this very amusing . She is a woman who bears her burdens well , the thousands of young people swarming in and out of her home . wearing her clothes , tending her child . Or at least she did until 5:00 A.M. today . Lowenstein , taking pity on the weak , had promised to turn their room over to McCarthy kids to sleep in . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to sleep . But at 6:30 the kids come by and demand the room and Lowenstein gets up , Jenny with him , she very angry , protesting , " I do n't care if they 're wounded . I do n't care if they 're dying . " Then they give the room up . He kept introducing them to me , " she recalled later , " and I kept refusing to be introduced . Perhaps I 'll never be a politician 's wife . " " What do you think he 's running for ? " someone asked her . " Some minor deity , " she said . " Are you sure it 's minor ? " On the Floor The local Jewish War Veterans post calls up , demanding that Lowenstein apologize to the Chicago police . This is a typical Daley move ; he calls his man with the Jews , who calls his man with the JWV , and thus the Jew is reprimanded , not by Mayor Daley. the Mayor is never touched by thiscriticism , he is above it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuasion ) . Tonight Daley is making a comeback . Somewhat bruised by all the attention he received Wednesday , he is making a Thursday comeback . On the way to the hall the street corners are crowded with Daley supporters and in the hall itself the claque is at the ready . This is the age of television and perhaps a more subtle man might disguise his claque , make it look like a spontaneous claque , but not Daley ; a claque is a claque and a convention is a City Hall meeting . They are all there , they sit together , wear the same clothes , carry the same signs , have the same faces , sitting there row on row , and at signals from the floor below , they cheer . " We Love Daley . " No impact . Had he dispersed them through the hall and left out a few signs he might have fooled someone . During the session , they show the film on Robert Kennedy ; it would always be hard to bear , but in this setting , following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this good and decent and strong young man . It underscores the emptiness and the ugliness of the rest of the week . On the floor the movie touches off a deep-rooted emotion and demonstration . People begin to sing " The Battle Hymn of the Repu , blic . " Singing for Kennedy , against Chicago , angrily and bitterly . Carl Albert , who was working for Humphrey ( they had , after all , the peace plank and the Presidency and the Vice Presidency , and the Credentials , they had already won , for whatever it was worth ) , Carl Albert is a stylish man , and so he relentlessly gavels it down ; after five days of banality he realizes that five minutes of singing is too much , and he moves to silence it . It goes on for nineteen minutes . It takes We-Love-Daley demonstrations finally to silence it . Now the dissidents are trying to nominate Vice Presidential candidates but this is difficult ; you have to reserve time in advance , and they can not get time . The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in of delegates arrested and tear-gassed . David Hoeh , the chairman of the New Hampshire delegation , is arrested for using a credit card in the security machine . It flashed green . His arrest at the end seems symbolic ; I had last seen him December 4 in Manchester , New Hampshire , pleading with McCarthy to enter the state . Only twenty-one days , he pleaded . McCarthy shook his head . Okay , only fourteen days then , he pleaded , we can do it , and then finally grabbing me , asking me to convince McCarthy to do it ; somehow his arrest seems to end it as his pleading had begun it . On the floor , Wisconsin is nominating Julian Bond and asking for Allard K. Lowenstein of New York to second it . Like Edward Kennedy , Julian Bond is too young , even legally too young , and it would not Work . Allard K. Lowenstein has laryngitis . But even so Carl Albert is afraid and Hubert Humphrey is too weak , and they will not let him speak . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
