In the 53 years since Albert Einstein published his general theory of relativity , it has withstood determined attacks and ingenious experiments by other scientists anxious to test its validity . Although no experimental results have contradicted the theory , they have not been precise enough to rule out opposing theories that differ in small but significant details . Now a new technique has been used to check out Einstein : interplanetary radar . Preliminary radar tests also have failed to find a flaw in general relativity , a scientist from Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Lincoln Laboratory announced last week , and radar soon should provide results accurate enough to help confirm the theory-or to seriously undermine it . <P> Last year , during two intervals when Mercury and Earth were on opposite sides of the sun , a team led by Physicist Irwin Shapiro bounced high-frequency signals from M.I.T. 's exceptionally precise Haystack radar antenna off the planet Mercury . On their way to and from Mercury , the signals , which travel at the speed of light , had to pass close to the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , solar gravity should have actually slowed them down , lengthening their 23-minute round-trip time to Mercury by one five-thousandth of a second . <P> Detecting so minute a change was no easy task . Using data gathered by the Haystack antenna and by other observatories , the researchers plotted both Earth 's and Mercury 's orbits to a degree of accuracy never before obtained ; it was essential to know Mercury 's exact distance at the time of the test to calculate the difference in round-trip time caused by solar gravity . <P> Eight Gigahertz . The M.I.T. team also had to design a new radar transmitter that would operate at eight gigahertz ( pronounced with hard gs ) , which is 8 billion cycles per second . Radar beams of lower frequency would be significantly slowed down by electrons in the solar corona , making it difficult to separate out the delay actually caused by the sun 's gravity . Corrections for Mercury 's surface irregularity had to be calculated ; round-trip time to a Mercurial valley would be longer than to a mountaintop . It was also essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might interfere with the attenuated , incredibly weak return signals , which , Shapiro says , had " less than a thousandth of the power that is expended by a housefly walking up a wall at a speed of one millimeter a century . " <P> Painstaking preparations paid off . As Mercury began to move behind the sun , M.I.T. computers detected increasing delays in the return of radar signals slowed by the sun 's gravitational field . Plotted against the theoretical delays predicted by the Einstein equations , the actual delay time formed a remarkably similar curve , increasing to approximately one five-thousandth of a second just before Mercury passed behind the sun . <P> Test results , which Shapiro regards as only preliminary , could be inaccurate by as much as 20% , and still leave some room for doubt about relativity . But refinements in the radar technique could soon reduce the uncertainty to less than 1% , he says , and further confirm or definitely overthrow Einstein 's general relativity .               @ @ @ @ @ @
