In recent weeks , militant leftist students have been interrupting worship at West German Protestant churches , which they claim are unconcerned with the real problems of the world . Among other things , the demonstrators have demanded that ministers turn their services into group discussions on such topics as the immorality of capitalism . Since no pastor has yet seen fit to accept this demand , the agitators have occasionally littered the churches with copies of a bitter fiscal parody of the Lord 's Prayer : <P> Our capital , which art in the West , <P> amortized be thy investments ; <P> Thy profits come , <P> Thy interest rates rise <P> in Wall Street as they do in <P> Europe ; Give us this day our daily turnover , <P> and extend to us our credits , <P> As we extend them to our debtors ; <P> Lead us not into bankruptcy , <P> But deliver us from trade unions , <P> For thine is half the world , <P> The power and riches <P> for the last 200 years . <P> Mammon . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Cuba . Last week Radio Progreso in Havana broadcast an interview with a campesino named Apolinar Hernandez , 60 , who out of gratitude for his new life since the glorious revolution is teaching his children a prayer of thanksgiving to the bearded Maximum Leader : <P> " Our Father , who is Fidel , who is with us sinners , free us from the power of Pontius Pilate , who is Lyndon Johnson , and from imperialism . Viva Communism , viva Fidel ; he is in the fore , and we behind him . We must always be at his side . Amen . "
