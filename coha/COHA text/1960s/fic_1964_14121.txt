About the year 1800 , an American sealing vessel , the President Adams , at anchor in an island harbor off the coast of Trinidad . The stage is part of the ship 's deck . Everything is unnaturally clean , bare and ship-shape . To one side , a polished , coal-black cannon . The American captain , AMASA DELANO from Duxbury , Massachusetts , sits in a cane chair . He is a strong , comfortable looking man in his early thirties who wears a spotless blue coat and white trousers . Incongruously , he has on a straw hat and smokes a corncob pipe . Beside him stands JOHN PERKINS , his bosun , a very stiff , green young man , a relative of DELANO 'S . THREE SAILORS , one carrying an American flag , enter . EVERYONE stands at attention and salutes with machinelike exactitude . Then the THREE SAILORS march off-stage . DELANO and PERKINS are alone . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO There goes the most beautiful woman in South America . JOHN PERKINS We never see any women , Sir ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , the flat dull sea , and a sky like a gray wasp 's nest . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I was n't talking about women , I was calling your attention to the American flag . JOHN PERKINS Yes , Sir ! I wish we were home in Duxbury . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO We are home . America is wherever her flag flies . My own deck is the only place in the world where I feel at home . p. 3 JOHN PERKINS That 's too much for me , Captain Delano . I mean I wish I were at home with my wife ; these world cruises are only for bachelors . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Your wife will keep . You should smoke , Perkins . Smoking turns men into philosophers and swabs away their worries . I can see my wife and children or not see them in each puff of blue smoke . JOHN PERKINS You are always tempting me , Sir ! I try to keep fit , I want to return to my wife as fit as I left her . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake you up . You should let  --  a little foreign dirt rub off on you . I 've taught myself to speak Spanish like a Spaniard . At each South American port , they mistake me for a Castilian Don . JOHN PERKINS Are n't you lowering yourself a little , Captain ? Excuse me , Sir , I have been wanting to ask you a question . Do n't you think our President , Mr. Jefferson , is lowering himself by being so close to the French ? I 'd feel a lot safer in this unprotected place if we 'd elected Mr. Adams instead of Mr. Jefferson . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO The better man ran second ! Come to think of it , he rather let us down by losing the election just after we had named this ship , the President Adams . Adams is a nervous dry fellow . When you 've travelled as much as I have , you 'll learn that that sort does n't export , Perkins . Adams did n't get a vote outside New England ! p. 4 JOHN PERKINS He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning the election . I 'm afraid I 'm a dry fellow , too , Sir . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Not when I 've educated you ! When I am through with you , Perkins , you 'll be as worldly as the Prince Regent of England , only you 'll be a first class American officer . I 'm all for Jefferson , he has the popular touch . Of course he 's read too many books , but I 've always said an idea or two wo n't sink our Republic . I 'll tell you this , Perkins , Mr. Jefferson is a gentleman and an American . JOHN PERKINS They say he has two illegitimate Negro children . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO The more the better ! That 's the quickest way to raise the blacks to our level . I 'm surprised you swallow such Federalist bilge , Perkins ! I told you Mr. Jefferson is a gentleman and an American ; when a man 's in office , Sir , we all pull behind him ! JOHN PERKINS Thank God our Revolution ended where the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're like the rest of the Latins , they 're hardly white people , they start with a paper republic and end with a toy soldier , like Bonaparte . JOHN PERKINS Yes , Sir . I see a strange sail making for the harbor . They do n't know how to sail her . p. 5 CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Hand me my telescope . JOHN PERKINS Aye , aye , Sir ! CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO With telescopeI see an ocean undulating in long scoops of swells ; it 's set like the beheaded French Queen 's high wig ; the sleek surface is like waved lead , cooled and pressed in the smelter 's mould . I see flights of hurried gray fowl , patches of fluffy fog . They skim low and fitfully above the decks , like swallows sabering flies before a storm . This gray boat foreshadows something wrong . JOHN PERKINS It does , Sir ! They do n't know how to sail her ! CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I see a sulphurous haze above her cabin , the new sun hangs like a silver dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to us . JOHN PERKINS What else , Sir ? CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO The yards are woolly the ship is furred with fog . On the cracked and rotten head-boards , the tarnished , gilded letters say , the San Domingo . A rat's-nest messing up the deck , black faces in white sheets are fussing with the ropes . I think it 's a cargo of Dominican monks . JOHN PERKINS Dominican monks , Sir ! God help us , I thought they were outlawed in the new world . p. 6 CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO No , it 's nothing . I see they 're only slaves . The boat 's transporting slaves . JOHN PERKINS Do you believe in slavery , Captain Delano ? CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO In a civilized country , Perkins , everyone disbelieves in slavery , everyone disbelieves in slavery and wants slaves . We have the perfect uneasy answer ; in the North , we do n't have them and want them ; Mr. Jefferson has them and fears them . JOHN PERKINS Is that how you answer , Sir , when a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DELANO Do n't ask me such intense questions . You should take up smoking , Perkins . There was a beautiful , dumb English actress  --  I saw her myself once in London . They wanted her to look profound , so she read Plato and the Bible and Benjamin Franklin , and thought about them every minute . She still looked like a moron . Then they told her to think about nothing . She thought about nothing , and looked like Socrates . That 's smoking , Perkins , you think about nothing and look deep . JOHN PERKINS I do n't believe in slavery , Sir . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO You do n't believe in slavery or Spaniards or smoking or long cruises or monks or Mr. Jefferson ! You are a Puritan , all faith and fire . p. 7 JOHN PERKINS Yes , Sir . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO God save America from Americans ! Takes up the telescopeI see octogonal network bagging out from her heavy top like decayed beehives . The battered forecastle looks like a raped Versailles . On the stern-piece , I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satyr , or something with its foot on a big white goddess . She has quite a figure . JOHN PERKINS They ought n't to be allowed on the ocean ! CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Who ought n't ? Goddesses ? JOHN PERKINS I mean Spaniards , who can not handle a ship , and mess up its hull with immoral statues . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO You 're out of step . You 're much too dry . Bring me my three-cornered hat . Order some men to clear a whaleboat . I am going to bring water and fresh fish to the San Domingo . These people have had some misfortune , Perkins ! JOHN PERKINS Aye , aye , Sir . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Spaniards ? The name gets you down , you think their sultry faces and language make them Zulus . You take the name Delano  --  I 've always thought it had some saving Italian or Spanish virtue in it . p. 8 JOHN PERKINS Yes , Sir . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO A Spaniard is n't a negro under the skin , particularly a Spaniard from Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians . Once you get inside a Spaniard , he talks about as well as your wife in Duxbury . JOHN PERKINS ShoutingA boat for the captain ! A whaleboat for Captain Delano ! A bosun 's whistle is heard , the lights dim . When they come up , we are on the deck of the San Domingo , the same set , identical except for litter and disorder . THREE AMERICAN SAILORS climb on board . They are followed by PERKINS and DELANO , now wearing a three-cornered hat . Once on board , the AMERICAN SAILORS salute DELANO and stand stiffly at attention like toys . NEGROES from the San Domingo drift silently and furtively forward CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I see a wen of barnacles hanging to the waterline of this ship . It sticks out like the belly of a pregnant woman . Have a look at our dory Bosun . JOHN PERKINS Aye , aye , Sir ! By now , about twenty blacks and two Spanish sailors have drifted in . They look like some gaudy , shabby , unnautical charade , and pay no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rigging calls out a single sharp warning in an unknown tongue . Then they all rush forward , shouting , waving their arms and making inarticulate cries like birds . Three shrill warnings come from the rigging . Dead silence . The men from the SAN DOMINGO press back in a dense semicircle . One by one , individuals come forward , make showy bows to DELANO , and speak p. 9 FIRST NEGRO Scurvy , Master Yankee ! SECOND NEGRO Yellow fever , Master Yankee ! THIRD NEGRO Two men knocked overboard rounding Cape Horn , Master Yankee ! FOURTH NEGRO Nothing to eat , Master Yankee ! NEGRO WOMAN Nothing to drink , Master Yankee ! SECOND NEGRO WOMAN Our mouths are dead wood , Master Yankee ! CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO You see , Perkins , these people have had some misfortune . General hubbub , muttering , shouts , gestures , ritual and dumbshow of distress . The rigging , hitherto dark , lightens , as the sun comes out of a cloud , and shows THREE OLD NEGROES , identical down to their shabby patches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying willow tops ; each is picking bits of unstranded rope for oakum . It is they who have been giving the warnings that control the people below . Everyone , DELANO along with the rest , looks up . DELANO turns aside and speaks to PERKINSIt is like a Turkish bazaar . JOHN PERKINS They are like gypsies showing themselves for money at a county fair , Sir . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO This is enchanting after the blank gray roll of the ocean ! Go tell the Spanish captain I am waiting for him . PERKINS goes off . Sharp warnings from the OAKUM-PICKERS . A big black spread of canvas is pulled creakingly and ceremoniously aside . SIX FIGURES stand huddled on a platform about four feet from the deck . They look like weak old invalids in bathrobes and nightcaps until they strip to the waist and turn out to be huge , shining young negroes . Saying nothing , they set to work cleaning piles of rusted hatchets . From time to time , they turn and clash their hatchets together with a rhythmic shout . PERKINS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Benito Cereno , he sends you his compliments , Sir . He looks more like a Mexican planter than a seaman . He 's put his fortune on his back : he does n't look as if he had washed since they left port . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Did you tell him I was waiting for him ? A captain should be welcomed by his fellow-captain . I ca n't understand this discourtesy . JOHN PERKINS He 's coming , but there 's something wrong with him . BENITO CERENO , led by his negro servant , BABU , enters . BENTTO , looking sick and dazed , is wearing a sombrero and is dressed with a singular but shabby richness . Head bent to one side , he leans in a stately coma against the rail , and stares unseeingly at DELANO . BABU , all in scarlet , and small and quick , keeps whispering , pointing and pulling at BENITO 'S sleeve . DELANO walks over to them CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Your hand , Sir . I am Amasa Delano , captain of the President Adams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your lucky day , the sun is out of hiding for the first time in two weeks , and here I am aboard your ship like the Good Samaritan with fresh food and water . DON BENITO CERENO The Good Samaritan ? Yes , yes , we must n't use the Scriptures lightly . Welcome , Captain . It is the end of the day . p. 11 CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO The end ? It 's only morning . I loaded and lowered a whaleboat as soon as I saw how awkwardly your ship was making for the harbor . DON BENITO CERENO Your whaleboat 's welcome , Captain . I am afraid I am still stunned by the storm . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Buck up . Each day is a new beginning . Assign some sailors to help me dole out my provisions . DON BENITO CERENO I have no sailors . BABU In a quick sing-song : Scurvy , yellow fever , ten men knocked off on the Horn , doldrums , nothing to eat , nothing to drink ! By feeding us , you are feeding the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a pretty way of talking . What do you need ? DELANO waits for BENITO to speak . When nothing more is said , he shifts awkwardly from foot to foot , then turns to his SAILORSStand to , men ! The AMERICAN SAILORS , who have been lounging and gaping , stand in a row , as if a button had been pressedLay our fish and water by the cabin ! The SAILORS arrange the watercans and baskets of fish by the cabin . A sharp whistle comes from the OAKUM-PICKERS . Almost instantly , the provisions disappearCaptain Cereno , you are surely going to taste my water ! p. 12 DON BENITO CERENO A captain is a servant , almost a slave , Sir . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO No , a captain 's a captain . I am sending for more provisions . Stand to ! The AMERICAN SAILORS stand toRow back to the ship . When you get there , take on five hogsheads of fresh water , and fifty pounds of soft bread . FIRST SAILOR salutes and goes down the ladderBring all our remaining pumpkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladderMy bosun and I will stay on board , until our boat returns . I imagine you can use us . DON BENITO CERENO Are you going to stay here alone ? Wo n't your ship be lost without you ? Wo n't you be lost without your ship ? BABU Listen to Master ! He is the incarnation of courtesy , Yankee Captain . Your ship does n't need you as much as we do . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Oh , I 've trained my crew . I can sail my ship in my sleep . Leaning over the railing and callingMen , bring me a box of lump sugar , and six bottles of my best cider . Turning to BENITOCider is n't my favorite drink , Don Benito , but it 's a New England specialty ; I 'm ordering six bottles for your table . BABU whispers and gestures to DON BENITO , who is exhausted and silent p. 13 BABU Une bouteille du vin to NEGROESMy master wishes to give you a bottle of the oldest wine in Seville . He whistles . A negro woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle , which she holds like a baby BABU ties a rope around the bottle BABU I am sending this bottle of wine to your cabin . When you drink it , you will remember us . Do you see these ribbons ? The crown of Spain is tied to one . Forgive me for tying a rope around the King of Spain 's neck . Lowers the wine on the rope to the whaleboat CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Shouting to his SAILORSPick up your oars ! SAILORS Aye , aye , Sir ! CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO We 're New England Federalists ; we can drink the King of Spain 's health . BENITO stumbles off-stage on BABU 'S arm JOHN PERKINS Captain Cereno has n't travelled as much as you have ; I do n't think he knew what you meant by the New England Federalists . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Leaning comfortably on the tail ; half to himself and half to PERKINSThe wind is dead . We drift away . We will be left alone all day , here in this absentee empire . Thank God , I know my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch them , Sir . Brown men in charge of black men  --  it does n't add up to much ! This Babu , I do n't trust him ! Why does n't he talk with a Southern accent , Like Mr. Jefferson ? They 're out of hand , Sir ! CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Nothing relaxes order more than misery . They need severe superior officers . They have n't one . Now , if this Benito were a man of energy a Yankee JOHN PERKINS How can a Spaniard sail ? CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Some can . There was Vasco da Gama and Columbus No , I guess they were Italians . Some can , but this captain is tubercular . JOHN PERKINS Spaniards and Negroes have no business on a ship . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Why is this captain so indifferent to me ? If only I could stomach his foreign reserve ! This absolute dictator of his ship only gives orders through his slaves ! He is like some Jesuit-haunted Hapsburg king about to leave the world and hope the world will end . JOHN PERKINS He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DELANO Perhaps it 's only policy , a captain 's icy dignity obliterating all democracy  --  JOHN PERKINS He 's like someone walking in his sleep . p. 15 CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Ah , slumbering dominion ! He is so self-conscious in his imbecility No , he 's sick . He sees his men no more than me . This ship is like a crowded immigration boat ; it needs severe superior officers , the friendly arm of a strong mate . Perhaps , I ought to take it over by force . No , they 're sick , they 've been through the plague . I 'll go and speak and comfort my fellow captain . I think you can help me , Captain . I 'm feeling useless . My own thoughts oppress me , there 's so much to do . I wonder if you would tell me the whole sad story of your voyage . Talk to me as captain to captain . We have sailed the same waters . Please tell me your story . DON BENITO CERENO A story ? A story ! That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to beg for stories back in Lima . Now my tongue 's tied and my heart is bleeding . Stops talking , as if his breath were gone . He stares for a few moments , then looks up at the rigging , as if he were counting the ropes one by one . DELANO turns abruptly to PERKINS CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Go through the ship , Perkins , and see if you can find me a Spaniard who can talk . DON BENITO CERENO You must be patient , Captain Delano ; if we only see with our eyes , sometimes we can not see at all . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I stand corrected , Captain ; tell me about your voyage . p. 16 DON BENITO CERENO It 's now a hundred and ninety days This ship , well manned , well officered , with several cabin passengers , carrying a cargo of Paraguay tea and Spanish cutlery . That parcel of Negro slaves , less than four score now , was once three hundred souls . Ten sailors and three officers fell from the mainyard off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , as they were beating down the icy sail . We threw away all our cargo , Broke our waterpipes , Lashed them on deck this was the chief cause of our suffering . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I must interrupt you , Captain . How did you happen to have three officers on the mainyard ? I never heard of such a disposal , it goes against all seamanship . BABU Our officers never spared themselves ; if there was any danger , they rushed in to save us without thinking . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I ca n't understand such an oversight . BABU There was no oversight . My master had a hundred eyes . He had an eye for everything . Sometimes the world falls on a man . The sea would n't let Master act like a master , yet he saved himself and many lives . He is still a rich man , and he saved the ship . DON BENITO CERENO Oh my God , I wish the world had fallen on me , and the terrible cold sea had drowned me ; that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through ! p. 17 BABU He is a good man , but his mind is off ; he 's thinking about the fever when the wind stopped  --  poor , poor Master ! Be patient , Yankee Captain , these fits are short , Master will be the master once again . DON BENITO CERENO The scurvy was raging through us . We were on the Pacific . We were invalids and could n't man our mangled spars . A hurricane blew us northeast through the fog . Then the wind died . We lay in irons fourteen days in unknown waters , our black tongues stuck through our mouths , but we could n't mend our broken waterpipes . BABU Always those waterpipes , he dreams about them like a pile of snakes ! DON BENITO CERENO Yellow fever followed the scurvy , the long heat thickened in the calm , my Spaniards turned black and died like slaves , The blacks died too . I am my only officer left . BABU Poor , poor Master ! He had a hundred eyes , he lived our lives for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CERENO In the smart winds beating us northward , our torn sails dropped like sinkers in the sea ; each day we dropped more bodies . Almost without a crew , canvas , water , or a wind , we were bounced about by the opposing waves through cross-currents and the weedy calms , and dropped our dead . Often we doubled and redoubled on our track like children lost in jungle . The thick fog hid the Continent and our only port from us. p. 18 BABU We were poor kidnapped jungle creatures . We only lived on what he could give us . He had a hundred eyes , he was the master . DON BENITO CERENO These Negroes saved me , Captain . Through the long calamity , they were as gentle as their owner , Don Aranda , promised . Don Aranda took away their chains before he died . BABU Don Aranda saved our lives , but we could n't save his . Even in Africa I was a slave . He took away my chains . DON BENITO CERENO I gave them the freedom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cargo or cannibals . But it was Babu  --  under God , I swear I owe my life to Babu ! He calmed his ignorant , wild brothers , never left me , saved the San Domingo . BABU Poor , poor Master . He is still a rich man . Do n't speak of Babu . Babu is the dirt under your feet . He did his best . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO You are a good fellow , Babu . You are the salt of the earth . I envy you , Don Benito ; he is no slave , Sir , but your friend . DON BENITO CERENO Yes , he is salt in my wounds . I can never repay him , I mean . Excuse me , Captain , my strength is gone . I have done too much talking . I want to rest . BABU leads BENITO to a shabby straw chair at the side . BENITO sits . BABU fans him with his sombrero p. 19 JOHN PERKINS He 's a fine gentleman , but no seaman . A cabin boy would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainyard . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Paying no attentionA terrible story . I would have been unhinged myself . Looking over toward BABU and BENITOThere 's a true servant . They do things better in the South and in South America  --  trust in return for trust ! The beauty of that relationship is unknown in New England . We 're too much alone in Massachusetts , Perkins . How do our captains and our merchants live , each a republic to himself . Even Sam Adams had no friends and only loved the mob . JOHN PERKINS Sir , you are forgetting that New England seamanship brought them their slaves . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Oh , just our Southern slaves ; we had nothing to do with these fellows . JOHN PERKINS The ocean would be a different place if every Spaniard served an apprenticeship on an American ship before he got his captain 's papers . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO This captain 's a gentleman , not a sailor . His little yellow hands got their command before they held a rope  --  in by the cabin-window , not the hawse-hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those easy calms  --  inexperience , sickness , impotence and aristocracy ! p. 20 JOHN PERKINS Here comes Robinson Crusoe and his good man Friday . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO We do n't beat a man when he 's down . BENITO advances uncertainly on BABU 'S armI am glad to see you on your feet again , That 's the only place for a Captain , sir ! I have the cure for you , I have decided to bring you medicine and a sufficient supply of water . A first class deck officer , a man from Salem , shall be stationed on your quarter deck , a temporary present from my owners . We shall refit your ship and clear this mess . DON BENITO CERENO You will have to clear away the dead . BABU This excitement is bad for him , Yankee Master . He 's lived with death . He lives on death still ; this sudden joy will kill him . You 've heard how , thirsty men die from overdrinking ! His heart is with his friend , our owner , Don Aranda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looks confused and shaken BABU scurries off and brings up the straw chair . BENITO sits CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Your friend is dead ? He died of fever ? DON BENITO CERENO He died very slowly and in torture . He was the finest man in Lima . We were brought up together , I am lost here . p. 21 CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Pardon me , Sir . You are young at sea . My experience tells me what your trouble is : this is the first body you have buried in the ocean . I had a friend like yours , a warm honest fellow , who would look you in the eye  --  we had to throw him to the sharks . Since then I 've brought embalming gear on board . Each man of mine shall have a Christian grave on land . You would n't shake so , if Don Aranda were on board , I mean , if you 'd preserved the body . DON BENITO CERENO If he were on board this ship ? If I had preserved his body ? BABU Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO You have the figurehead ? BABU You see that thing wrapped up in black cloth ? It 's a figurehead Don Aranda bought us in Spain . It was hurt in the storm . It 's very precious . Master takes comfort in it , he is going to give it to Don Aranda 's widow . It 's time for the pardon ceremony , Master . Sound of clashing hatchets CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I am all for these hatchet-cleaners . They are saving cargo . They make an awful lot of pomp and racket though about a few old , rusty knives . DON BENITO CERENO They think steel is worth its weight in gold . A slow solemn march is sounded on the gongs and other instruments . A gigantic coal-black NEGRO comes up the steps . He wears a spiked iron collar to which a chain is attached that goes twice around his arms and ends padlocked to a broad band of iron . The NEGRO comes clanking forward and stands dumbly and like a dignitary in front of BENITO . Two small black boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which they support on a velvet cushion . BENITO springs up , holds the ball , and raises the cane rigidly above the head of the negro in chains . For a moment , he shows no trace of sickness . The assembled blacks sing , " Evviva , Benito ! " three times p. 22 BABU At one side with the Americans , but keeping an eye on BENITOYou are watching the humiliation of King Atufal , once a ruler in Africa . He ruled as much land there as your President . Poor Babu was a slave even in Africa , a black man 's slave , and now a white man 's . DON BENITO CERENO In a loud , firm voiceFormer King Atufal , I call on you to kneel ! Say , " My sins are black as night , I ask the King of Spain 's pardon through his servant , Don Benito . " Pause . ATUFAL does n't move NEGROES Your sins are black as night , King Atufal ! Your sins are black as night , King Atufal ! CAPTAIN AMASA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you later , Yankee Captain . DON BENITO CERENO Ask pardon , former King Atufal . If you will kneel , I will strike away your chains . ATUFAL slowly raises his chained arms and lets them dropAsk pardon ! WOMAN SLAVE Ask pardon King Atufal . DON BENITO CERENO Go ! Sound of instruments . The BLACK BOYS take BENITO 'S ball and cane . The straw chair is brought up . BENITO sits . FRANCESCO then leads him off-stage p. 23 BABU Francesco ! I will be with you in a moment , Master . You must n't be afraid , Francesco will serve you like a second Babu . DON BENITO CERENO Everyone serves me alike here , but no one can serve me as you have . BABU I will be with you in a moment . The Yankee master is at sea on our ship . He wants me to explain our customs . BENITO is carried off-stageYou would think Master 's afraid of dying , if Babu leaves him ! CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I can imagine your tenderness during his sickness . You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BABU You say such beautiful things , the United States must be a paradise for people like Babu . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I do n't know . We have our faults . We have many states , some of them could stand improvement . BABU The United States must be heaven . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I suppose we have fewer faults than other countries . What did King Atufal do ? BABU He used the Spanish flag for toilet paper . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO That 's treason . Did Atufal know what he was doing ? Perhaps the flag was left somewhere it should n't have been . Things are n't very strict here . p. 24 BABU I never thought of that . I will go and tell Master . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Oh , no , you must n't do that ! I never interfere with another man 's ship . Don Benito is your lord and dictator . How long has this business with King Atufal been going on ? BABU Ever since the yellow , fever , and twice a day . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow . You should n't call him a king , though , it puts ideas into his head . BABU Atufal had gold wedges in his ears in Africa ; how he wears a padlock and Master bears the key . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I see you have a feeling for symbols of power . You had better be going now , Don Benito will be nervous about you . BABU goes offThat was a terrible thing to do with a flag ; everything is untidy and unravelled here  --  this sort of thing would never happen on the President Adams . JOHN PERKINS Your ship is as shipshape as our country , Sir . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I wish people would n't take me as representative of our country : America 's one thing , I am another ; we should n't have to bear one another 's burdens . p. 25 JOHN PERKINS You are a true American for all your talk , Sir ; I ca n't believe you were mistaken for a Castilian Don . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO No one would take me for Don Benito . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some traveling actor from a circus ? CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO No , Cereno is a great name in Peru , like Winthrop or Adams with us . I recognize the family features in our captain . An OLD SPANISH SAILOR , grizzled and dirty , is seen crawling on all fours with an armful of knots toward the Americans . He points to where BENITO and BABU have disappeared and whistles . He holds up the knots as though he were in chains , then throws them out loosely on the deck in front of him . A GROUP OF NEGROES forms a circle around him , holding hands and singing childishly . Then , laughing , they carry the SPANIARD off-stage on their shouldersThese blacks are too familiar ! We are never alone ! Sound of gongs . Full minute 's pause , as if time were passing . DELANO leans on the railing . The sun grows brighterThis ship is strange . These people are too spontaneous  --  all noise and show , no character ! Real life is a simple monotonous thing . I wonder about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Benito hesitated himself in telling it . No one could run a ship so stupidly , and place three officers on one yard . BENITO and BABU returnA captain has unpleasant duties ; I am sorry for you , Don Benito. p. 26 DON BENITO CERENO You find my ship unenviable , Sir ? CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I was talking about punishing Atufal ; he acted like an animal ! DON BENITO CERENO Oh , yes , I was forgetting He was a King , How long have you lain in at this island , Sir ? CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Oh , a week today . DON BENITO CERENO What was your last port , Sir ? CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Canton . DON BENITO CERENO You traded seal-skins and American muskets for Chinese tea and silks , perhaps ? CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO We took in some silks . DON BENITO CERENO A little gold and silver too ? CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO just a little silver . We are only merchants . We take in a dollar here and there . We have no Peru , or a Pizarro who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll find things have changed a little in Peru since Pizarro , Captain . Starts to move away . BABU whispers to him , and he comes back abruptly , as if he had forgotten something importantHow many men have you on board , Sir ? p. 27 CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Some twenty-five , Sir . Each man is at his post . DON BENITO CERENO They 're all on board , Sir , now ? CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO They 're all on board . Each man is working . DON BENITO CERENO They 'll be on board tonight , Sir ? CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Tonight ? Why do you ask , Don Benito ? DON BENITO CERENO Will they all be on board tonight , Captain ? CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO They 'll be on board for all I know . PERKINS makes a sign to DELANOWell , no , to tell the truth , today 's our Independence Day . A gang is going ashore to see the village . A little diversion improves their efficiency , a little regulated corruption . DON BENITO CERENO You North Americans take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchant ships go more or less armed ? CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO A rack of muskets , sealing spears and cutlasses . Oh , and a six-pounder or two ; we are a sealing ship , but with us each merchant is a privateer  --  only in case of oppression , of course . You 've heard about how we shoot pirates . BABU Boom , boom , come Master . BENITO walks away on BABU 'S arm and sits down , almost off-stage in his straw chair . They whisper . Meanwhile , a SPANISH SAILOR climbs the rigging furtively , spread-eagles his arms and shows a lace shirt under his shabby jacket . He points to BENITO and BABU and winks . At a cry from ONE OF THE OAKUM PICKERS , THREE NEGROES help the SPANIARD down with servile , ceremonious attentions p. 28 JOHN PERKINS Did you see that sailor 's lace shirt , Sir ? He must have robbed one of the cabin passengers . I hear that people strip the dead in these religious countries . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO No , you do n't understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a beggar or a noble , often both ; they have no middle class . With them it 's customary to sew a mess of gold and pearls on rags  --  that 's how an aristocracy that 's going to the dogs keeps up its nerve . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO It 's odd though , that Spanish sailor seemed to want to tell me something . He , ought to dress himself properly and speak his mind . That 's what we do . That 's why we 're strong : everybody trusts us . Nothing gets done when every man 's a noble . I wonder why the captain asked me all those questions ? JOHN PERKINS He was passing the time of day , Sir ; It 's a Latin idleness . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO It 's strange . Did you notice how Benito stopped rambling ? He was conventional consecutive for the first time since we met him . Something 's wrong . Perhaps , they 've men below the decks , a sleeping volcano of Spanish infantry . The Malays do it , play sick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doped beggars on deck , two hundred sweating murderers packed below like sardines  --  that 's rot ! Anyone can see these people are really sick , sicker than usual . Our countries are at peace . I wonder why he asked me all those questions ? p. 29 JOHN PERKINS Just idle curiosity . I hear the gentlemen of Lima sit at coffee-tables from sun to sun and gossip . They do n't even have women to look at ; they 're all locked up with their aunts . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Their sun is going down . These old empires go . They are much too familiar with their blacks . I envy them though , they have no character , they feel no need to stand alone . We stand alone too much , that 's why no one can touch us for sailing a ship ; When a country loses heart , it 's easier to live . Ah , Babu ! I suppose Don Benito 's indisposed again ! Tell him I want to talk to his people ; there 's nothing like a well man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ siesta , Yankee Master . His siesta is sacred , I am afraid to disturb it . Instead , let me show you our little entertainment . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Let 's have your entertainment ; if you know a man 's pleasure you know his measure . BABU We are a childish people . Our pleasures are childish . No one helped us , we know nothing about your important amusements , such as killing seals and pirates . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I 'm game . Let 's have your entertainment . BABU signals . The gong sounds ten times and the canvas is pulled from the circular structure . Enclosed in a triangular compartment , an OLD SPANISH SAILOR is dipping naked white dolls in a tar-pot p. 30 BABU This little amusement keeps him alive , Yankee Master . He is especially fond of cleaning the dolls after he has dirtied them . The OLD SPANISH SAILOR laughs hysterically , and then smears his whole face with tar OLD SPANISH SAILOR My soul is white ! BABU The yellow fever destroyed his mind . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as his face , is defiled with pitch ! BABU He says his soul is white . The structure is pushed around and another triangular compartment appears . A NEGRO BOY is playing chess against a splendid Spanish doll with a crown on its head . He stops and holds two empty wine bottles to his earsThis boy is deaf . The yellow fever destroyed his mind . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Why is he holding those bottles to his ears ? BABU He is trying to be a rabbit , or listening to the ocean , his mother  --  who knows ? CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO If he 's deaf , how can he hear the ocean ? Anyway , he ca n't hear me . I pass , let 's move on . The structure is pushed around to a third compartment . A SPANISH SAILOR is holding a big armful of ropeWhat are you knotting there , my man ? p. 31 OLD SPANISH SAILOR The knot . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO So I see , but what 's it for ? OLD SPANISH SAILOR For someone to untie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knot from DELANOIt 's dirty , it will dirty your uniform . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Let 's move on . Your entertainment is rather lacking in invention , Babu . BABU We have to do what we can We are just beginners at acting . This next one will be better . The structure is pushed around and shows a beautiful NEGRO WOMAN . She is dressed and posed as the Virgin Mary . A Christmas crche is arranged around her . A VERY WHITE SPANIARD dressed as Saint Joseph stands behind her . She holds a Christ-child , the same crowned doll , only black , the NEGRO BOY was playing chess againstShe is the Virgin Mary . That man is not the father . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I see . I suppose her son is the King of Spain . BABU The Spaniards taught us everything , there 's nothing we can learn from you , Yankee Master . When they took away our country , they gave us a better world . Things do not happen in that world as they do here . p. 32 CAPTAIN AMASA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary . BABU Yes , the Bible says , " I am black not white . " When Don Aranda was dying , we wanted to give him the Queen of Heaven because he took away our chains . JOHN PERKINS The Spaniards must have taught them everything ; they 're all mixed up , they do n't even know their religion . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO No , no ! The Catholic Church does n't just teach , it knows how to take from its converts . BABU Do you want to shake hands with the Queen of Heaven , Yankee Master ? CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO No , I 'm not used to royalty . Tell her I believe in freedom of religion , if people do n't take liberties . Let 's move on . BABU Kneeling to the Virgin MaryI present something Your Majesty has never seen , a white man who does n't believe in taking liberties , Your Majesty . The structure is pushed around and shows ATUFAL in chains but with a crown on his head BABU This is the life we believe in . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spanish flag ! p. 33 CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Please do n't ask me to shake hands with King Atufal ! The canvas is put back on the structure BABU You look tired and serious , Yankee Master . We have to have what fun we can . We never would have lived through the deadly calms without a little amusement . Bows and goes off The NEGROES gradually drift away . DELANO sighs with relief CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Well , that was n't much ! I suppose Shakespeare started that way . JOHN PERKINS Who cares ? I see a speck on the blue sea , Sir , our whaleboat is coming . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO A speck ? My eyes are speckled . I seem to have been dreaming . What 's solid ? Touches the ornate railing ; a piece falls onto the deckThis ship is nothing , Perkins ! I dreamed someone was trying to kill me ! How could he ? Jack-of-the-beach , they used to call me on the Duxbury shore . Carrying a duck-satchel in my hand , I used to paddle along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn much there . I was always shooting duck or gathering huckleberries along the marsh with Cousin Nat ! I like nothing better than breaking myself on the surf . I used to track the seagulls down the five-mile stretch of beach for eggs . How can I be killed now at the ends of the earth by this insane Spaniard ? Who could want to murder Amasa Delano ? My conscience is clean . God is good . What am I doing on board this nigger-pirate ship ? p. 34 JOHN PERKINS You 're not talking like a skipper , Sir . Our boat 's a larger spot now . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I am childish . I am doddering and drooling into my second childhood . God help me , nothing 's solid ! JOHN PERKINS Don Benito , Sir . Touch him , he 's as solid as his ship . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Don Benito ? He 's a walking ghost ! BENITO comes up to DELANO . BABU is a few steps behind him DON BENITO CERENO I am the ghost of myself , Captain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood . I was a child , too , once , I have dreams about it . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO StartingI 'm sorry . This jumping 's just a nervous habit . I thought you were part of my dreams . DON BENITO CERENO I was taking my siesta , I dreamed I was a boy back in Lima . I was with my brothers and sisters , and we were dressed for the festival of Corpus Christi like people at our Bourbon court . We were simple children , but something went wrong ; little black men came on us with beetle backs . They had caterpillar heads and munched away on our fine clothes . They made us lick their horned and varnished insect legs . Our faces turned brown from their spit , we looked like bugs , but nothing could save our lives ! p. 35 CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Ha , ha , Captain . We are like two dreams meeting head-on . My whaleboat 's coming , we 'll both feel better over a bottle of cider . BABU blows a bosun 's whistle . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ranks BABU It 's twelve noon , Master Yankee . Master wants his midday shave . ALL THE NEGROES Master wants his shave ! Master wants his shave ! DON BENITO CERENO Ah , yes , the razor ! I have been talking too much . You can see how badly I need a razor . I must leave you , Captain . BABU No , Don Amasa wants to talk . Come to the cabin , Don Amasa . Don Amasa will talk , Master will listen . Babu will lather and strop . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I want to talk to you about navigation . I am new to these waters . DON BENITO CERENO Doubtless , doubtless , Captain Delano . JOHN PERKINS I think I 'll take my siesta , Sir . He walks off BENITO , BABU , and DELANO walk toward the back of the stage . A scrim curtain lifts , showing a light deck cabin that forms a sort of attic . The floor is matted , partitions that still leave splintered traces have been knocked out . To one side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a dirty missal ; above it , a small crucifix , rusty crossed muskets on one side , rusty crossed cutlasses on the other . BENITO sits down in a broken throne-like and gilded chair . BABU begins to lather . A magnificent array of razors , bottles and other shaving equipment lies on a table beside him . Behind him , a hammock with a pole in it and a dirty pillow p. 36 CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO So this is where you took your siesta . DON BENITO CERENO Yes , Captain , I rest here when my fate will let me . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO This seems like a sort of dormitory , sitting-room , sail-loft , chapel , armory , and private bedroom all together . DON BENITO CERENO Yes , Captain : events have not been favorable to much order in my personal arrangements . BABU moves back and opens a locker . A lot of flags , torn shirts and socks tumble out . He takes one of the flags , shakes it with a flourish , and ties it around BENITO 'S neck BABU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save his clothes . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO The Castle and the Lion of Spain . Why , Don Benito , this is the flag of Spain you 're using ! It 's well it 's only I and not the King of Spain who sees this ! All 's one , though , I guess , in this carnival world . I see you like gay colors as much as Babu . BABU GigglingThe bright colors draw the yellow fever from Master 's mind . Raises the razor BENITO begins to shakeNow , Master , now , Master ! p. 37 DON BENITO CERENO You are talking while you hold the razor . BABU You must n't shake so , Master . Look , Don Amasa , Master always shakes when I shave him , though he is braver than a lion and stronger than a castle . Master knows Babu has never yet drawn blood . I may , though , sometime , if he shakes so much . Now , Master ! Come , Don Amasa , talk to Master about the gales and calms , he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calms , the more I think of them the more I wonder . You say you were two months sailing here ; I made that stretch in less than a week . We never met with any calms . If I 'd not heard your story from your lips , and seen your ruined ship , I would have said something was missing , I would have said this was a mystery ship . DON BENITO CERENO For some men the whole world is a mystery ; they can not believe their senses . BENITO shakes , the razor gets out of hand and cuts his cheekSanta Maria ! BABU Poor , poor Master , see , you shook so ; this is Babu 's first blood . Please answer Don Amasa , while I wipe this ugly blood from the razor and strop it again . DON BENITO CERENO The sea was like the final calm of the world On , on it went . It sat on us and drank our strength , crosscurrents eased us out to sea , the yellow fever changed our blood to poison . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us stood by you ! DON BENITO CERENO Yes , my Spanish crew was weak and surly , but the blacks , the blacks were angels . Babu has kept me in this world . I wonder what he is keeping me for ? You belong to me . I belong to you forever . BABU Ah , Master , spare yourself . Forever is a very long time ; nothing 's forever . With great expertness , delicacy and gentleness , BABU massages BENITO 'S cheeks , shakes out the flag , pours lotion from five bottles on BENITO 'S hair , cleans the shaving materials , and stands off admiring his workMaster looks just like a statue . He 's like a figurehead , Don Amasa ! DELANO looks , then starts to walk out leaving BENITO and BABU . The curtain drops upon them . DELANO rejoins PERKINS , lounging at the rail JOHN PERKINS Our boat is coming . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO GailyI know ! I do n't know how I 'll explain this pomp and squalor to my own comfortable family of a crew . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in a Negro , something that makes him fit to have around your person . His comb and brush are castanets . What tact Babu had ! What noiseless , gliding briskness ! p. 39 JOHN PERKINS Our boat 's about along side , Sir . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO What 's more , the Negro has a sense of humor . I do n't mean their boorish giggling and teeth-showing , I mean his easy cheerfulness in every glance and gesture . You should have seen Babu toss that Spanish flag like a juggler , and change it to a shaving napkin ! JOHN PERKINS The boat 's here , Sir . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO We need inferiors , Perkins , more manners , more docility , no one has an inferior mind in America . JOHN PERKINS Here is your crew , Sir . BABU runs out from the cabin . His cheek is bleeding CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Why , Babu , what has happened ? BABU Master will never get better from his sickness . His bad nerves and evil fever made him use me so . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I 've nicked him , Don Amasa . He cut me with his razor . Do you think I will die ? I 'd rather die than bleed to death ! CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO It 's just a pinprick , Babu . You 'll live . BABU I must attend my master . Runs back into cabin p. 40 CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Just a pinprick , but I would n't have thought Don Benito had the stuff to swing a razor . Up north we use our fists instead of knives . I hope Benito 's not dodging around some old grindstone in the hold , and sharpening a knife for me . Here , Perkins , help our men up the ladder . Two immaculate AMERICAN SAILORS appear carrying great casks of water . Two more follow carrying net baskets of wilted pumpkins . The NEGROES begin to crowd forward , shouting , " We want Yankee food , we want Yankee drink ! " DELANO grandiosely holds up a pumpkin ; an OLD NEGRO rushes forward , snatches at the pumpkin , and knocks DELANO off-balance into PERKINS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with his fist . All is tense and quiet . The SIX HATCHET-CLEANERS lift their hatchets above their heads CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO FuriousAmericans , stand by me ! Stand by your captain ! Like lightning , the AMERICANS unsling their muskets , fix bayonets , and kneel with their guns pointing at the NEGROESDon Benito , Sir , call your men to order ! BABU We 're starving , Yankee Master . We mean no harm ; we 've never been so scared . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO You try my patience , Babu . I am talking to Captain Cereno ; call your men to order , Sir . p. 41 DON BENITO CERENO Make them laugh , Babu . The Americans are n't going to shoot . BABU airily waves a hand . The NEGROES smile . DELANO turns to BENITOYou must n't blame them too much ; they 're sick and hungry . We have kept them cooped up for ages . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO As the NEGROES relaxForm them in lines , Perkins ! Each man shall have his share . That 's how we run things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what his claims . NEGROES Standing back , bleating like sheepFeed me , Master Yankee ! Feed me , Master Yankee ! CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO You are much too close . Here , Perkins , take the provisions aft . You 'll save lives by giving each as little as you can , Be sure to keep a tally . FRANCESCO , a majestic , yellow-colored mulatto , comes up to DELANO FRANCESCO My master requests your presence at dinner , Don Amasa . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Tell him I have indigestion . Tell him to keep better order on his ship . It 's always the man of good will that gets hurt ; my fist still aches from hitting that old darky . FRANCESCO My master has his own methods of discipline that are suitable for our unfortunate circumstances . Will you come to dinner , Don Amasa ? p. 42 CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I 'll come . When in Rome , do as the Romans . Excuse my quick temper , Sir . It 's better to blow up than to smoulder . The scrim curtain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with silver has been laid out . The locker has been closed and the Spanish flag hangs on the wall . DON BENITO is seated , BABU stands behind him . As soon as DELANO sits down , FRANCESCO begins serving with great dignity and agility FRANCESCO A finger bowl , Don Amasa . After each statement , he moves about the tableA napkin , Don Amasa . A glass of American water , Don Amasa . A slice of American pumpkin , Don Amasa . A goblet of American cider , Don Amasa . DELANO drinks a great deal of cider , BENITO hardly touches his CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO This is very courtly for a sick ship , Don Benito . The Spanish Empire will never go down , if she keeps her chin up . DON BENITO CERENO I 'm afraid I sha n't live long enough to enjoy your prophecy . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I propose a toast to the Spanish Empire on which the sun never sets ; may you find her still standing , when you land , Sir ! DON BENITO CERENO Our Empire has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another month . I wish I could say the same for myself . My sun is setting , I hear the voices of the dead in this calm . p. 43 CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO You hear the wind lifting ; it 's bringing our two vessels together . We are going to take you into port , Don Benito . DON BENITO CERENO You are either too late or too early with your good works . Our yellow fever may break out again . You are n't going to put your men in danger , Don Amasa ? CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO My boys are all healthy , sir . DON BENITO CERENO Health is n't God , I would n't trust it . FRANCESCO May I fill your glass , Don Amasa ? BABU New wine in new bottles , that 's the American spirit , Yankee Master . They say all men are created equal in North America . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO We prefer merit to birth , boy . BABU motions imperiously for FRANCESCO to leave . As he goes , bowing to the CAPTAINS , FOUR NEGROES play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle is supposed to have been in the French Convention , and voted for the death of the French King . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO This polite and royal fellow is no anarchist ! BABU Francesco is very ancien regime , he is even frightened of the Americans . He does n't like the way you treated King George . Babu is more liberal . p. 44 CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO A royal fellow , this usher of yours , Don Benito ! He is as yellow as a goldenrod . He is a king , a king of kind hearts . What a pleasant voice he has ! DON BENITO CERENO GlumlyFrancesco is a good man . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO As long as you 've known him , he 's been a worthy fellow , has n't he ? Tell me , I am particularly curious to know . DON BENITO CERENO Francesco is a good man . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I 'm glad to hear it , I am glad to hear it ! You refute the saying of a planter friend of mine . He said , " When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he is a devil . " DON BENITO CERENO I 've heard your planter 's remark applied to intermixtures of Spaniards and Indians ; I know nothing about mulattoes . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO No , no , my friend 's refuted ; if we 're so proud of our white blood , surely a little added to the blacks improves , their breed . I congratulate you on your servants , Sir . BABU We 've heard that Jefferson , the King of your Republic , would like to free his slaves . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Jefferson has read too many books , boy , but you can trust him . He 's a gentleman and an American ! He 's not lifting a finger to free his slaves . p. 45 BABU We hear you have a new capital modelled on Paris , and that your President is going to set up a guillotine on the Capitol steps . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Oh , Paris ! I told you you could trust Mr. Jefferson , boy , he stands for law and order like your mulatto . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CERENO I 'm afraid I 'm just a provincial Spaniard , Captain . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Let me tell you about Paris . You know what French women are like  --  nine parts sex and one part logic . Well , one of them in Paris heard that my ship was the President Adams . She said , " You are descended from Adam , Captain , you must know everything , tell me how Adam and Eve learned to sleep together . " Do you know what I said ? DON BENITO CERENO No , Captain . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I said , " I guess Eve was a Frenchwoman , the first Frenchwoman . " Do you know what she answered ? DON BENITO CERENO No , Captain Delano . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO She said , " I was trying to provoke a philosophical discussion , Sir . " A philosophical discussion , ha , ha ! You look serious , Sir . You know , something troubles me . DON BENITO CERENO Something troubles you , Captain Delano ? p. 46 CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I still ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scurvy , why did it kill off three Spaniards in every four , and only half the blacks ? Negroes are human , but surely you could n't have favored them before your own flesh and blood ! DON BENITO CERENO This is like the Inquisition , Captain Delano . I have done the best I could . BABU dabs BENITO 'S forehead with cider BABU Poor , poor Master ; since Don Aranda died , he trusts no one except Babu . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Your Babu is an uncommonly intelligent fellow ; you are right to trust him , Sir . Sometimes I think we overdo our talk of freedom . If you looked into our hearts , we all want slaves . DON BENITO CERENO Disease is a mysterious thing ; it takes one man , and leaves his friend . Only the unfortunate can understand misfortune . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I must return to my bosun ; he 's pretty green to be left alone here . Before I go I want to propose a last toast to you ! A good master deserves good servants ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the scrim curtain falls , concealing BENITO and BABUThat captain must have jaundice , I wish he kept better order . I do n't like hitting menials. p. 47 JOHN PERKINS I 've done some looking around , Sir . I 've used my eyes . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO That 's what they 're for , I guess . You have to watch your step , this hulk , this rotten piece of finery , will fall apart . This old world needs new blood and Yankee gunnery to hold it up . You should n't mess around , though , it 's their ship ; you 're breaking all the laws of the sea . JOHN PERKINS Do you see that man-shaped thing in canvas ? CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I see it . JOHN PERKINS Behind the cloth , there 's a real skeleton , a man dressed up like Don Benito . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO They 're Catholics , and worship bones . JOHN PERKINS There 's writing on its coat . It says , " I am Don Aranda , " and , " Follow your leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PERKINS I saw two blacks unfurling a flag , a black skull and crossbones on white silk . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO That 's piracy . We 've been ordered to sink any ship that flies that flag . Perhaps they were playing . JOHN PERKINS I saw King Atufal throw away his chains , He called for food , the Spaniards served him two pieces of pumpkin , and a whole bottle of your cider . p. 48 CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Don Benito has the only key to Atufal 's padlock . My cider was for the captain 's table . JOHN PERKINS Atufal pointed to the cabin where you were dining , and drew a finger across his throat . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Who could want to kill Amasa Delano ? JOHN PERKINS I warned our men to be ready for an emergency . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO You 're a mind reader , I could n't have said better myself ; but we 're at peace with Spain . JOHN PERKINS I told them to return with loaded muskets and fixed bayonets . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Here comes Benito . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BABU brings out BENITO 'S chair . BENITO sits in itIt 's good to have you back on deck , Captain . Feel the breeze ! It holds and will increase . My ship is moving nearer . Soon we will be together . We have seen you through your troubles . DON BENITO CERENO Remember , I warned you about the yellow fever . I am surprised you have n't felt afraid . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Oh , that will blow away . Everything is going to go better and better ; the wind 's increasing , soon you 'll have no cares . After the long voyage , the anchor drops into the harbor . It 's a great weight lifted from the captain 's heart . We are getting to be friends , Don Benito . My ship 's in sight , the President Adams ! How the wind braces a man up ! I have a small invitation to issue to you . p. 49 DON BENITO CERENO An invitation ? CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I want you to take a cup of coffee with me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasted such coffee as my old steward makes . What do you say , Don Benito ? DON BENITO CERENO I can not leave my ship . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Come , come , you need a change of climate . The sky is suddenly blue , Sir , my coffee will make a man of you . DON BENITO CERENO I can not leave my ship . Even now , I do n't think you understand my position here . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I want to speak to you alone . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I am alone , as much as I ever am . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO In America , we do n't talk about money in front of servants and children . DON BENITO CERENO Babu is not my servant . You spoke of money  --  since the yellow fever , he has had a better head for figures than I have . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO You embarrass me , Captain , but since circumstances are rather special here , I will proceed . DON BENITO CERENO Babu takes an interest in all our expenses . p. 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you about your expenses . I am responsible to my owners for all the sails , ropes , food and carpentry I give you . You will need a complete rerigging , almost a new ship , in fact , You shall have our services at cost . DON BENITO CERENO I know , you are a merchant . I suppose I ought to pay you for our lives . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I envy you , Captain . You are the only owner of the San Domingo , since Don Aranda died . I am just an employee . Our owners would sack me , if I followed my better instincts . DON BENITO CERENO You can give your figures to Babu , Captain . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO You are very offhand about money , Sir ; I do n't think you realize the damage that has been done to your ship . Ah , you smile . I 'm glad you 're loosening up . Look , the water gurgles merrily , the wind is high , a mild light is shining . I sometimes think such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Abraham and Isaac . It seems as if Providence were watching over us . JOHN PERKINS There are things that need explaining here , Sir . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Yes , Captain , Perkins saw some of your men unfurling an unlawful flag , a black skull and crossbones. p. 51 DON BENITO CERENO You know my only flag is the Lion and Castle of Spain . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO No , Perkins says he saw a skull and crossbones . That 's piracy . I trust Perkins . You 've heard about how my government blew the bowels out of the pirates at Tripoli ? DON BENITO CERENO Perhaps my Negroes CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO My government does n't intend to let you play at piracy ! DON BENITO CERENO Perhaps my Negroes were playing . When you take away their chains CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I 'll see that you are all put back in chains , if you start playing pirates ! JOHN PERKINS There 's something else he can explain , Sir . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Yes , Perkins saw Atufal throw off his chains and order dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DON BENITO CERENO I have the key . You ca n't imagine how my position exhausts me , Captain . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO I can imagine . Atufal 's chains are fakes . You and he are in cahoots , Sir ! JOHN PERKINS They do n't intend to pay for our sails and service . They think America is Santa Claus . p. 52 CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO The United States are death on pirates and debtors . JOHN PERKINS There 's one more thing for him to explain , Sir . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Do you see that man-shaped thing covered with black cloth , Don Benito ? DON BENITO CERENO I always see it . CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Take away the cloth . I order you to take away the cloth ! DON BENITO CERENO I can not . Oh , Santa Maria , have mercy ! CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO Of course , you ca n't . It 's no Virgin Mary . You have done something terrible to your friend , Don Aranda . Take away the cloth , Perkins ! As PERKINS moves forward , ATUFAL suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BABU Dancing up and down and beside himselfLet them see it ! Let them see it ! I ca n't stand any more of their insolence ; the Americans treat us like their slaves ! BABU and PERKINS meet at the man-shaped object and start pulling away the cloth . BENITO rushes between them , and throws them back and sprawling on the deck . BABU and PERKINS rise , and stand hunched like wrestlers , about to close in on BENITO , who draws his sword with a great gesture . It is only a hilt . He runs at BABU and knocks him down . ATUFAL throws off his chains and signals to the HATCHET-CLEANERS . They stand behind BENITO with raised hatchets . The NEGROES shout ironically , " Evviva Benito ! " You too , Yankee Captain ! If you shoot , we 'll kill you . p. 53 CAPTAIN AMASA DELANO If a single American life is lost , I will send this ship to the bottom , and all Peru after it . Do you hear me , Don Benito ? DON BENITO CERENO Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ! BABU He is as powerless as you are . DON BENITO CERENO Do n't you understand ? He has been holding a knife at my back . I have , been talking all day to save your life . BABU Holding a whipDo you see this whip ? When Don Aranda was out of temper , he used to snap pieces of flesh off us with it .
