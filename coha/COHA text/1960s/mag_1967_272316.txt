As the air war entered a new and hotter phase , the skies above North Viet Nam were thick with U.S. planes - and with Communist flak . U.S. pilots flew an average of 243 sorties a day , hitting several targets that they had never be fore been permitted to bomb , but care fully avoiding throwing any knockout punches . As the monsoon rains cleared , U.S. jets blasted MIG airfields for the first time and hit new targets in the port city of Haiphong and around Hanoi . For the time being , they left un touched the large Phuc Yen strip north west of Hanoi , the base for nearly three-fourths of the North 's 120 MIG fighters . <P> They also steered clear of the core of Hanoi and the docks at Haiphong , where most of the aid from Russia and China flows into North Viet Nam . <P> Carrier-based Navy jets screeched through MIG-cluttered skies to hit the MIG base at Kep , northeast of Hanoi , with 250-lb. bombs and cluster bombs that spray thousands of lethal metal fragments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run way , control tower and oil-storage tanks , but apparently caught few , if any , MIGs in their hardstands ; an orange cloud of billowing smoke was visible al most 20 miles away . Flying out of bases in Thailand , a dozen Air Force Phantom jets then scorched the new MIG base at Hoa Lac , damaged or destroyed at least seven of the dozen or so MIGs on the ground in one raid , and then returned later in the week for a second attack . All told , the U.S. lost eleven attack planes in the week 's raids , but U.S. jets knocked down five MIGs and lost only two planes in several furious dogfights over the North 's cities . <P> At least six of the 16 U.S. pilots who lost their planes were rescued , a few of them - Navy Ensign James Laing for one - after having ejected from their aircraft in midair . <P> Aggressive Pursuit . For almost two years , the Navy and the Air Force have been asking for permission to hit the North 's jet airfields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 of the 521 U.S. planes thus far lost over Viet Nam have been brought down by MIGs ; antiaircraft fire has downed most of the others . But MIGs frequently force a U.S. fighter-bomber to jettison its payload or to fly into a heavy curtain of flak in order to evade their pursuit , and lately they have been more aggressive in challenging U.S. planes . Red China last week claimed to have shot down three U.S. aircraft over its territories , including an automatically controlled reconaissance plane . But U.S. pilots report that they have so far chased no North Vietnamese MIGs to the Chinese border , and their generals feel that Hanoi is unlikely to exile its air force to China now that the U.S. has attacked two of its bases .
