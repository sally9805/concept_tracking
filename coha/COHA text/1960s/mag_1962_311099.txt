Hard-eyed little Bill Hartack , 30 , has twice won the Kentucky Derby , four times been acclaimed racing 's leading jockey . Working up to this year 's Derby , Hartack could count himself well pleased - or so it seemed . His mount was Mrs. Moody Jolley 's Ridan , a Kentucky-bred speedster who had won ten of his 13 starts and once equaled the world record for five furlongs in a casual , early-morning breeze . <P> But Hartack was unimpressed . He told the owners that Ridan ( Nadir spelled backwards ) was impossible to rate , could not be held back for a run in the stretch , probably could not go the 1-mile Derby distance . He lost the mount and wound up on George Pope 's Decidedly , a handsome grey colt that had never won a stakes race . The handicappers gave him no better than a 15-to-1 chance . Said Hartack : " I came down here for only one reason-to win . " <P> On race day , as 15 sleek thoroughbreds paraded to the post , all eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite Sir Gaylord , was out of the race - he had pulled up lame the day before-and the smart money figured Ridan at 2 to 1 . Breaking perfectly , the horses pounded around the fading arc of the clubhouse turn , fought for position on the rail . As they swept into the back stretch , Hartack might have permitted himself a grim smile . Up ahead , Ridan refused to obey the commands of Jockey Manuel Ycaza and spurted into a three-length lead . Ycaza stood bolt upright in the stirrups , desperately trying to hold the stubborn colt back . It was a losing fight . <P> At the stretch turn , exhausted , Ridan bore out and began to fade . The lead changed hands three times . In mid-stretch , Ridan gallantly came on again-only by now it was too late . On the far outside , Hartack was making his move . Chopping viciously with his whip , he drove Decidedly past the winded Ridan , past all the others . At the finish , Decidedly was 2 lengths in front . <P> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third Kentucky Derby victory around his horse 's head , Bill Hartack heard the time : 2 min. ? sec. , and a new record , a full second better than the old mark set by Whirlaway in 1951 , with Eddie Arcaro aboard .
