Wherever the U.S. economy is going , one thing is plain : not in many months has there been a better chance for the consumer to pick up bargains . <P> Out from the Chicago headquarters of Montgomery Ward last week began to flow 5,500,000 Christmas catalogues that tantalized customers-and irked competitors . Prices have been cut an average 7.8% below those in the last catalogue . Portable typewriters have been slashed from $119.50 to $107.75 , electric shavers from $20.57 to $17.95 , some bicycles from $32.95 to $29.88 . Bigger cuts have been made in toys . Said an excited executive of competing Sears , Roebuck , which immediately rushed out a lower-priced supplement to its Yule catalogue : " They 're giving the business away . " <P> While price cutting in 1960 has been confined largely to the overstocked appliance industry , it is spreading . Eagle-eyed shoppers can find bargains in medium-and lower-priced furniture lines , housewares , drugs , cosmetics , cameras and sporting goods . Many stores are doing their cutting in special sales , e.g. , Manhattan 's Macy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even those of the discount houses . <P> <P> Buyers ' Market . The shrewd bargainer can get good discounts on 1960 autos if he finds a dealer with a hefty backlog . Cuts on 1961 " models are harder to find . They are selling too well . Goodyear is slicing its winter tire prices from 10% to more than 15% on popular sizes . American Motors was the only U.S. automaker to raise its 1961-model prices-by $10 to $60-and the Frigidaire division of General Motors announced last week that it is " holding the price line " on 1961-model appliances . Even Robert Burns took big ads to boast price cuts in its Panatela cigars from two for 27 to two for 25 . <P> Prices of newer homes , which have traditionally increased yearly , are merely standing still . " It 's definitely a buyers ' market , " said Frederick Hastings , president of Chicago 's Homefinders Inc . " There have been more houses on sale than at any time in the last five or six years . Tight money had a great deal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic activity . " <P> One of the unusual features of the new competition is that merchants who are stressing quality instead of price say they are doing well . Manufacturers and distributors of hardware , meeting in Manhattan last week , reported that U.S. consumers are spending more freely for many higher-priced items for home , lawn and garden , passing up cheaper articles . <P> Despite the price trimming , most businessmen , already caught in the profit squeeze , do not see any general across-the-board price cutting ahead . They think consumers may be waiting for this . But when it does not come , retailers think that consumers will step up their buying .
