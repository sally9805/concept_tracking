California 's Edgar Kaiser , 56 , is an uncommonly sentimental tycoon . Whenever he sees his father , the legendary Henry J. Kaiser , 82 , he greets the old man with a warm hug and a kiss . Two weeks ago , when Edgar was decorated with Brazil 's Order of the Southern Cross , the tears flowed freely down his cheeks . On business matters , however , Edgar Kaiser is eminently dry-eyed . Finally stepping out of his father 's long shadow , he has taken full charge of the family 's 100-company empire and spread the business into 40 countries on six continents . Last week , as the last of their major companies reported for 1964 , the Kaisers toted up profits of $46 million on sales of $1.3 billion . For their major manufacturing arms , it was the brightest year since Henry J. started making steel , building ships and breaking production records in 1941 . <P> Rising on Risks . Next week Edgar Kaiser will jet from his headquarters in Oakland , Calif. , to Venezuela , where Kaiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is building the $137 million Guri Dam . Meanwhile , Kaiser Aluminum is busy putting up new plants in West Berlin , Turkey and Japan . Kaiser Steel has just closed the largest trade deal in Australia 's history : with a local partner , it will sell $600 million worth of iron ore to Japan over the next 15 years . Kaiser Cement &; Gypsum this month opened a mill in Florida , and later this year will start up another in New Jersey , thus invading the eastern U.S. market . <P> Like his father , Edgar rushes in where the timid fear to tread , following the company 's slogan- " Find a need , and fill it . " Optimism is the cornerstone of the Kaiser philosophy , and Edgar argues with folksy persuasion that the world 's needs are bound to rise so fast that he would be foolish not to try to meet them . <P> Such a philosophy obviously has built-in risks . Kaiser has taken on an extraordinarily heavy debt load , which both limits the payment of cash dividends and makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last year his engineers lost $16 million , largely because a Kaiser dam in Greece was washed out by floods . A dike-building project in Israel was damaged when the Dead Sea overflowed-for the first time since the days of Moses . Other businessmen often wonder why Kaiser is deeply committed in such unpredictable areas as Latin America ( where Kaiser-Willys is the continent 's biggest auto producer ) , or India ( where Kaiser operates the country 's largest aluminum plant ) , or Ghana ( where Kaiser is building the $196 million Volta Dam and an aluminum plant that will be served by it ) . To such questioning , Edgar gives a disarming answer : " How are you ever going to give these people the opportunity to know us unless you work with them ? "
