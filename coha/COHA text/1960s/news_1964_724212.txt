txt Washington If private polls were the same as real ballots President Johnson could forget about the election . They are n't , however , and nearly every observer here believes that the presently indicated big Democratic majority on the polls wo n't look the same next Nov. 3 . No doubt about it , as of this minute Mr. Johnson is sitting pretty . Senator Goldwater looks like one of the most under underdogs in years . But Mr. Johnson faces awkward problems . They lie right ahead . Every problem means a decision and every decision leaves a minority of discontent . A whole lot of minorities could mean a majority . Difficult Choice President Johnson 's 3-to-2 advantage in opinion polls seems unrealistic for election day . Here are some of the problems he faces . Vietnam : This might well be the toughest of all . The United States-aided campaign is n't going well . The administration certainly hoped to shore up things till after the election , but the possibility is now that things wo n't wait . He may have to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in deeper , which would alienate many ; or he can withdraw altogether , which would give Senator Goldwater a field day . In fact the Republicans show every sign of hitting the Vietnam issue no matter what happens , arguing that it reveals administration ineptitude , indecision and softness toward communism . Meanwhile there 's the so-called " white backlash " at home . Will Negro riots stop in big cities in the next two months ? Nobody knows . But with one in four teen-age Negroes unemployed and standing on street corners there seems no end to racial pressure . Theoretically the United States is prosperous and once more Mr. Johnson has emphasized it , but unemployment still hangs close to 5 percent , and it will probably take a lot more than the President 's well-advertised antipoverty program to get full employment . Detroit voters in the Michigan primary this past week indicated existence of a " white backlash. " although voting in other areas of the state clouded this interpretation . Voters in the heavily Democratic Motor City approved the so-called " Homeowner 's Rights " ordinance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house to anyone for any reason . This , then , would permit housing discrimination . It was opposed both by Gov . George Romney and Mayor Jerome Cavanaugh . Embarrassing Moment Counterbalancing this to some degree was the defeat in the same Democratic primary of Rep. John Lesinski , the only Northern Democrat to vote against the Civil Rights Act , by Rep. John Dingell , a liberal Democrat . The two were pitted in a reapportioned district . The vote was fairly close . The administration now has new trouble in the Bobby Baker case . It could n't have come at a more embarrassing time . Many Democrats hoped the Senate had swept the thing under the rug for good . The case involves Robert G. Baker , former secretary of the Senate majority and one-time friend of President Johnson . Mr. Baker 's nemesis and erstwhile business associate is Don B. Reynolds , Maryland insurance man . Sen. John J. Williams ( 131 of Delaware now charges that builder Matthew McCloskey , former finance chairman of the Democratic Party , appointed Ambassador to the Republic of Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big District of Colombia stadium , including $25,000 channeled into the 1960 Democratic campaign . Senator Williams charged in the Senate that Mr. Reynolds received the $35,000 as agent for the performance bond , kept $10.000. and passed the balance on to the Democrats . Mr. McCloskey denies this . President Johnson has ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate . Senator Goldwater is already using this issue . Democrats wanted to sweep Vietnam under the rug , he told a crowd this week , but could n't because they found Bobby Baker already there . Left Action Charged Prospect is that the Baker case will be reopened but that Senate hearings wo n't come until after the election . Besides the Baker case there is a lesser controversy in New York City . It is charged that the Johnson-backed Mobilization For Youth , an antipoverty organization , has attracted some Communists , or left-wing extremists . to its staff . City Council President Paul R. Screvane promises ' a full report promptly . Washington weighs controversies like these and considers none of them apt to be decisive in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
