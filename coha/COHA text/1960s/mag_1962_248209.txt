For a few hours last week , as the Cuban crisis blotted out everything else , all work came to a standstill at the long-awaited Mexico City meeting of hemisphere finance ministers on the state of the Alliance for Progress . The session was less than two days old when President Kennedy sent an emergency message summoning home U.S. Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon . Before he left , Dillon did put the Latins at ease on one point . The U.S. , he said , was prepared to replenish the coffers of the Inter-American Development Bank , would also provide $1 billion in aid next year to match the $1 billion earmarked last year . <P> Without Dillon the delegates got down to work analyzing the Alliance 's disappointing first year . Many Latin American nations complained that the U.S. was quick to commit funds but slow to disburse them . In a spirit of selfcriticism , they also noted their own shortcomings . Only half of the countries had completed or were close to completing development plans , either short-or long-range . Eight countries had adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the rest were simply conducting studies . Large-scale housing is still in the planning stage ; improved schooling is hardly under way ; the shortage of doctors and nurses is still acute . <P> <P> For one of the most general complaints about the Alliance-that it fails to reach down to Latin America 's impoverished masses-the delegates proposed that two top Latin American statesmen be chosen to work independently , and , as their imaginations dictate , to spread the Alianza 's message . Favored candidates : Colombia 's ex-President Alberto Lleras Camargo and Brazil 's ex-President Juscelino Kubitschek.
