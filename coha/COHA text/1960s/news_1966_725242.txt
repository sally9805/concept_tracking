txt The controversy has a lot of people up in the air . Like Mrs. Rubi Lorans , a 30-year-old New York housewife . And Hugh Warren , a tennis-playing Chevy dealer from Ada , Okla . And Edward Telford , a California highway official . Mrs. Lorans is up in the air because she lives there  --  in a 30-story apartment house built over an eight-lane approach to the George Washington bridge that connects New York City and New Jersey . Mr. Warren is up there because he plays tennis on a court built on the " air rights " dyer the Ada reservoir . Mr. Telford is n't as literally up in the air ; he 's just unhappy about the whole idea of air rights , fearing the motorist stands to lose . The use of air rights is nothing new . The Pan Am Building in New York and the Prudential Building and Marina Towers in Chicago are all built on leased air rights  --  but they 're private structures constructed over private rights-of-way . The current controversy , however , concerns the trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  over public rights-of-way , especially highways . The Two Views Such developments " are probably generating well - over $10 million a year in public revenues , to say nothing of what they 're say , Mg public bodies " on facilities , such as schools , of their own , and " the sum could run well over $100 million a year in five or 10 years , " says Walter R. Kuehnle , former president of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers . Maybe so , counters Mr. Telford , but structures over highways threaten to ruin nearby attractively planted areas , compound congestion , lead to utter paralysis in times of national emergency and " destroy the value of the motor operator 's investment ( gasoline taxes ) by forcing him to drive through tunnels . " The movement certainly has gotten- off the ground in the past few years . " Four or five years ago air-rights developments involving public facilities were practically unheard of , " says Mr. Kuelude . Now , in New York alone , there are four apartment buildings over the George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slated for this . year over subway yards in Harlem and subway tracks in Brooklyn ; an apartment house over a new school has been approved for the Bronx , and a high school will shortly be built over a parkway in the Bronx . In Washington , the General Services Administration successfully used aesthetics as an arguthent in favor of its proposal to build a $48 million Labor Department building over the entrance to an underground freeway . " The building ' will actually protect the city 's appearance by hiding a gaping gulch , with all that traffic pouring through it , from public view , " says a GSA official . Congress has considered air-rights development sufficiently promising for combating blight to incorporate a provision in the Housing Act of 1964 enabling the Government to pay up to 75% of the cost of building parks over roadways and other facilities in urban renewal areas . The Bureau of Public Roads has approved a civic center over an interstate highway at Fall River , Mass. , and soon expects to approve an apartment project over the interstate system in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grows , however , so does the grumbling .. Tenants on the lower floors of the George Washington bridge apartments , for example , are up in arms over auto exhaust and noise from the traffic below . ( But not Mrs. Lorans ; she likes it there . ) Mr. Telford , chief of California Division of Highways ' district 7 , which covers Los Angeles , Ventura and Orange counties ( with 8 million cars and 4 million people ) , fears that airrights construction will make it especially difficult to doubledeck freeways if that becomes desirable . Indeed , Mr. Telford already is pushing for authority to doubledeck a highly congested portion of the Santa Ana Freeway in downtown Los Angeles . The grumbling might be having some effect . Donato Melaccio , assistant deputy commissioner of New York City 's department of real estate , says the city would like to sell air rights over the main library on 42nd Street , a favorite building of New Yorkers . " But we just do n't think it would be publicly acceptable , " he says . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate to have a government building of just three or four stories on that land . " Some of the public , of course , is all but ecstatic over some of the projects . Businessmen in Ada , Okla. , excited over the city 's plan to turn a reservoir rooftop into tennis courts , ended up donating all the materials and funds needed for the job . P. S. Karr , the park superihtendent , figures the eight courts in a conventional location would have run at least 850,000. not even including land costs .
