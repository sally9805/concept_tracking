Negroes-particularly middle-class Negroes-often complain that the only blacks who ever get into print are athletes , performers , rioters and occasional politicians . They ask : What about the rest of us ? The ones who are going to school , making it through college , getting engaged , marrying , succeeding at a job ? The rather lame answer can only be that , here and there , more black faces are beginning to appear in society and business columns of a few newspapers scattered across the country . But where Negro success makes surefire copy is between the covers of Ebony magazine . <P> Appropriately enough , the magazine that honors success is one itself . After 22 years of publishing , Ebony has a circulation of 1,054,932 , almost all of it Negro . It bulges with ads ; revenue totaled $7,000,000 last year . Its publisher , John H. Johnson , puts out three other magazines as well : Jet ( circ. 453,095 ) , a pocket-size weekly of news tidbits ; Tan ( 121,392 ) , a monthly combination of homemaking advice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a literary monthly . Since he is also board chairman of Supreme Life Insurance Co. and owns a cosmetics company , Johnson is one of the wealthiest Negro businessmen in the U.S. <P> From a Negro Angle . The Johnson publications are straightforwardly of , by and for Negroes . News of the world is almost exclusively colored black . The July issue covered the funeral of Bobby Kennedy by running photos of the prominent Negroes who attended : Cleveland Mayor Carl B. Stokes , Rafer Johnson , Mrs. Martin Luther King Jr. , among others . The accompanying story was a perceptive account of Bobby 's growth as a civil rights leader . In a previous issue , U.S. Senators got their pictures in the magazine only because they happen to frequent the Senate restaurant presided over by a Negro maitre d'hotel , Robert Parker Jr . Said the story : " Even for Senator Richard Russell ( D. , Ga. ) , who is not noted for his high esteem for Negroes , ' there is only one maitre d ' in the U.S.-Parker . ' " <P> An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his adult life , Johnson , 50 , is less the brilliant innovator than a shrewd judge of the Negro community . He has been careful not to get too far ahead of the times-or too far behind . He started Ebony , he said in his prospectus , " to emphasize the brighter side of Negro life and success . " As the darker side has come more into view , Ebony has adjusted . Last winter , Senior Editor Lerone Bennett Jr . provoked considerable controversy and a stern rebuttal from the New York Times when he wrote an article debunking Abraham Lincoln as the " embodiment of the American racist tradition . " As part of the same mood , whites have been replaced by Negroes in ads in the magazine , though some readers are upset because Ebony continues to run ads for hair straighteners and skin lighteners.
