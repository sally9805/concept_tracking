ORCHESTRAS The Elite Eleven <P> When the Ford Foundation awarded an $85 million grant to U.S. orchestras five months ago , it was paying tribute to the nation 's richest and most underrated cultural asset . The symphony orchestra has long been a mighty factor in the creative life of U.S. communities , but most Americans , cowed by a self-consciousness about European culture , have never acknowledged it . <P> Actually , when it comes to making symphony music , the Old World is not only inferior to the U.S. , it is n't even old . The New York Philharmonic , for example , was founded in 1842 , is 40 years older than the Berlin Philharmonic ; the St. Louis Symphony ( 1885 ) predates both Amsterdam 's Concertgebouw Orchestra and the London Symphony . Indeed , by most any yardstick , U.S. orchestras outstrip their counterparts on the Continent . Last season the Vienna Philharmonic performed 50 concerts and the London Symphony 32 , while the Philadelphia Orchestra played 179 and the Boston Symphony 206 . Of the world 's 2,000 orchestras , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . France , by contrast , has only two professional symphony orchestras outside Paris , Britain only six outside London . <P> What is more , the quality of the top U.S. orchestras has developed to such a marked degree in the past few years that the Big Five-Boston , Chicago , Cleveland , New York and Philadelphia - are being crowded for honors by numerous other contenders . The first to surface was the Pittsburgh Symphony under Conductor William Steinberg . Through unstinting musicianship and an easygoing charm , Steinberg has molded his orchestra into a precision instrument of the highest caliber ( TIME , Sept. 11 , 1964 ) . Moving west , there are no fewer than five more orchestras which , by the outstanding efforts of their masterbuilder conductors , now merit room at the top with the Big Five and Pittsburgh , comprising , in all , what might be called the Elite Eleven . <P> &gt; DETROIT SYMPHONY operates under the successful " Detroit Plan , " which this season accounted for contributions of $275,000 from 185 corporations , and a broad base of individual support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchestra . " Sweden 's Sixten Ehr-ling , 48 , who replaced the venerable Paul Paray as conductor in 1962 , has tempered the heavily romantic repertory favored by " Papa Paray " with stiff doses of modern music , has sharpened the ensemble playing into machine-tooled precision , and has added a velvety sheen to the orchestra 's sound with the addition of 23 new musicians this year . Intense , sharp-featured Ehrling has brought a dashing and vigorous new image to the Detroit podium . <P> &gt; HOUSTON SYMPHONY has come a long way from the days when it played Old Black Joe for encores and accompanied a wrestling match at a war-bond rally . The secret of the Houston 's success today is Sir John Barbirolli , 66 , whose solid musicianship , gained during a long career as conductor of such ensembles as the New York Philharmonic and Britain 's Hall Orchestra , compensates mightily for the lack of depth in his players . Mindful that attendance had skidded with the modernist programming of Leopold Stokowski ( 1955-61 ) , Barbirolli plays it safe and sticks close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound as fresh and breezy as the Southwest itself .
