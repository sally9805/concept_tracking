" Good morning , comrades , " intones the announcer pleasantly to all South Viet Nam . " You are listening to Radio Liberation . " With that , the clandestine transmitter broadcasting from North Viet Nam begins seven hours of Marxist propaganda , spiced with Vietnamese folk songs . <P> This is the voice of the Communist enemy in Viet Nam , or , as the Reds call their organization , " the National Front for the Liberation of South Viet Nam . " Technically , the Front is in overall charge of the bitter war being waged by the Viet Cong Communist guerrillas . One of its most important but less-known functions is to administer the one-third of South Vietnamese territory controlled by the Reds . In fact , it runs what amounts to an entire separate government . <P> Talk &; Chop . Formed three years ago , the Liberation Front has a " cabinet " composed of South Vietnamese ; the " chairman " is Nguyen Huu Tho , 53 , a Saigon-born , French-educated lawyer . But naturally , he is only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ho Chi Minh . The Front 's " capital " is believed to be the Viet Cong 's military GHQ , which is situated deep in the jungle 75 miles northwest of Saigon , conveniently close to the Cambodian frontier , and protected by a maze of fortifications plus 1,000 elite troops . From there , a disciplined apparatus extends through provincial and district levels , down to the smallest village where the Reds roam . <P> First task of the Front , in an area under guerrilla influence , is to indoctrinate the populace . An estimated 4,000 propaganda squads follow Red guerrilla units into villages . The Front even publishes 30 crude newspapers . New fly sheets appear daily , accusing the Americans of everything from introducing whores into Buddhist monasteries to gouging out , frying and eating children 's eyeballs . The Front uses harsher methods : more than 10,000 local government officials have been assassinated in the long war , usually by beheading . <P> Above all , the Reds strive to set up a rudimentary regime that will appear to rival the Saigon government . Boldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of villages . The guerrillas levy taxes , circulate their own currency , even operate a primitive postal system , complete with censors and stamps printed in Hanoi . For weeks , Radio Liberation has been triumphantly boasting that the organization held its " second national congress " early in January in a secret " liberated area . " The 150 delegates were said to have demonstrated " a mood of patriotism as mighty as the Mekong River . " <P> Battle of Presences . The Front claims it gets so many volunteers from the countryside that guerrilla recruits are turned awry for lack of physical fitness , boasts that it is winning the battle for men 's minds in its areas . That is probably an exaggeration ; in one guerrilla-harassed village recently , a survey by the Saigon government revealed that only 10% of the people collaborated with the Viet Cong willingly .
