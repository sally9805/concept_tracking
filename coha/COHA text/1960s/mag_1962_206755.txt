Two for the Seesaw . Gittel Moscowitz is a slob . Also a kook . Number one , she lives in the Village and looks it . She is 29 but she still wears ballet flats , black tights and bulky knits , and her hair is like something she maybe found under a bed . Add to which she is having her second ulcer and living on cottage cheese , as everybody can plainly see from the mess on the front of her bulky knit . But Gittel has a career . She is known as Gittel Mosca on the stage-of the 92nd Street Y.M.H.A. Gittel has push . For years she picked up her unemployment check every week and rode the subway uptown to study interpretive dancing with Jos Limn . And Gittel has principles . No matter how terribly she is tempted , she never sleeps with a man on the first date . Unfortunately , Gittel also has a heart as big as Hadassah . She supports half the dead-beatniks who shack up with her , and sometimes she even pays their train fare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is the happy-go-unlucky heroine of this earthy , funny , warm and surprisingly wise little comedy adapted by Isobel Lennart from the Broadway success ( 1958-59 ) by Playwright William Gibson . Like the play , the film tells the story of Gittel 's affair with a visiting fireman who has run out of steam , a lawyer ( Robert Mitchum ) from Omaha whose problems gee with Gittel 's . She has been a doormat for men , he has been a lap dog for his wife . He needs self-reliance , she needs self-respect . <P> In the course of their brief affair the lawyer and the slob laugh , cry , work , play , fight , love , live . And at the end of the affair , they are wiser and stronger than they were before . For the first time in his life , the lawyer loves as a grown man loves , taking what he wants and leaving what he does n't ; and what he does n't want , he decides , is to spend his life with Gittel . The shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life she refuses to give herself to a man who does n't want her self . She sends him home , and home he goes to make a new and hopeful start . <P> Seesaw has its ups and downs , among them MacLaine and Mitchum . On Broadway , Anne Bancroft opened her veins and transfused the audience with hot red gouts of life and laughter ; in the film , MacLaine turns on her talent like a spigot , and out comes a cooler flow of charm and humor . On Broadway , Henry Fonda was a mirror skillfully held to reflect the heroine ; in the film , Mitchum is just another blank wall in her cold-water flat . Still and all , in the passage from Broadway to Hollywood , not too much of the Gibson has been spilled .
