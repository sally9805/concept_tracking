Sherwood Harry Egbert , president of Studebaker-Packard , barreled down the test track at the company 's South Bend plant one day last week in a sleek sports coupe , the likes of which no U.S. motorist has ever seen . Still shrouded in deep corporate secrecy , the new car was nonetheless already the talk of Detroit . Christened Avanti ( Italian for " Forward " ) , it is finless , aerodynamically clean , and fast ; it may well prove the most talked-of car turned out by any U.S. automaker since Ford Motor Co. introduced its first Thunderbird . <P> The Avanti is harddriving , flamboyant Sherwood Egbert 's own brainchild . Ever since he took over faltering Studebaker-Packard in February 1961 , Egbert has been painfully aware that the company badly needs some avanti pointing . Stuck with his predecessors ' designs , Egbert saw Studebaker sell only a paltry 72,155 cars last year , managed to turn a $3.1 million loss into a $2.5 million profit only by selling off the company 's plastics division to Monsanto . <P> Loewy 's Wave Length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Egbert had the 1962 Lark enlarged and face-lifted . This March was Studebaker 's best sales month in two years , and despite a 38-day strike ( TIME , Jan. 26 ) , production of the 1962 models has already surpassed Studebaker 's entire 1961 output . But for Egbert this was only the barest beginning ; he long ago decided that to win a real new lease on life Studebaker must overcome its total identification with the plain-feathered Lark by bringing out an entirely new and daring car . <P> To get what he wanted , Egbert turned to famed Industrial Designer Raymond Loewy , who was responsible for the handsome 1947 Studebaker that had an important influence on the style of postwar U.S. autos . Flying to California early in 1961 to meet Loewy , Egbert roughed out a small sketch . " I knew at once , " says Loewy , " that we were on the same wave length . " <P> The Power Look . The Avanti , says Designer Loewy , " looks power . " Its sloping , grill-less hood bears only single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low-slung air scoop . Its high , rounded rump tucks under at the bottom like that of a rabbit in full flight and the waist of the car is slightly indented in Coke-bottle fashion-a design feature previously used only on supersonic jet fighters . Inside , reflecting Egbert 's love of flying , the Avanti resembles a plush airplane with instruments set in neat , easy-to-reach groups , has two bucket seats in front , and a bucket bench for two in the rear . With a fiber-glass body mounted on a steel chassis and an engine of 300 h.p. or more , the Avanti will go from standing to 60 m.p.h. in a scant 6.7 sec. -a performance rivaling that of the hottest European sports cars . It is expected to sell for about $4,500.
