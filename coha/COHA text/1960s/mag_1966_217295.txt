The bombing of the DMZ marked an anniversary of sorts . Two years ago this month , the U.S. launched its aerial punishment of the Communist North with the retaliatory raid against Communist PT-boat installations in the Gulf of Tonkin . Six months later , it became a daily routine . The American campaign from the skies is running some 670 sorties a day over both North and South Viet Nam , rivaling that of the Korean War . For the third time , Navy jets returned to the big oil-storage tanks outside the port of Haiphong , claimed afterward that cumulative destruction of the complex now stood at 90% . Though monsoon clouds hampered raids north of the Red River , American planes elsewhere in Ho Chi Minh-land pounded 41 smaller fuel depots , bridges , flak sites and more than 230 barges . <P> Never before has tactical air power been used so intensively to help fight a ground war . As a result , American pilots in Viet Nam must possess a versatility unknown to their World War II counterparts . They man a varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phantom jets to windmilling Skyraiders . Their work is peculiarly dangerous , involving multiple threats from sky and ground ; more than 300 American planes have been shot down . It takes guts and guile . <P> Yellow Birds . Typical of the breed-and to many the hottest pilot-is U.S. Air Force Major James Kasler , 40 , of Indianapolis , who is dubbed by his wingmates a " one-man Air Force . " A World War II tail gunner and six-kill ace in Korea , Kasler in five months of flying missions over the North has limped home four times with his F-105 riddled by flak or MIGs , has seen 30 SAM missiles ( " They 're long , very slender and a dirty-yellow color " ) zoom up in his vicinity , tangled in the longest dogfight with MIGs thus far in the war ( 17 minutes ) . Six weeks ago , Kasler flew as co-leader of the raid on Hanoi 's oil installations . <P> But his forte is the fine art of target spotting-the No. 1 challenge of a war in which U.S. airmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities , must search out isolated objectives against a foe supremely skilled at camouflage . Says a fellow pilot of Kasler : " He is part hawk . " Blue-eyed Kasler has his own explanation of the job . " When you know where to look for ground targets , " says he , " suddenly they start popping into your vision . When you look at rivers , you are looking for camouflaged boats under overhanging trees . You look for roads running up to rivers . They have to traverse a river somehow , so somewhere near that area are pontoon bridges or barges , motor tugs or ferries . "
