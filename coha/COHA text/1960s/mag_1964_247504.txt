THE PRESIDENCY <P> Off on a three-day tour of politicking and party fund raising in the Mid west , President Johnson landed at Detroit 's Metropolitan Airport in a ten-passenger Air Force JetStar . Where was Air Force One , the giant , four-jet Boeing liner the President usually rides ? Well , explained an aide , on purely political trips like this one the Air Force bills the Democratic National Commit tee for presidential transportation . The tab for Air Force One is $2,350 an hour , for the JetStar only $522 . <P> In fact , what the cost-conscious Lyndon Johnson saved was a drop in the bucket compared to what he raised . In Detroit , 74 of the party faithful paid $1,000 apiece for cocktails and a presidential handshake . Then the President went to Cobo Hall where 1,700 paid $100 apiece to dine with him . <P> There were some ordinarily Republican faces in the Democratic crowd . At the head table sat longtime Republican Henry Ford II , who has announced he will support Johnson in November but who had never before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat John Gordon , president of General Motors Corp. , and seven of his top executives . Cracked the President : " I am proud and inspired and stimulated that there is a Ford in my future . And with Jack Gordon here to night , I hope there is a Chevrolet . Lady Bird and I have waited so , so long to be a two-car family . " And the two automen , who have labor-contract negotiations opening this week , have waited so , so long for a President who , they hope , might not be inclined to interfere on the side of labor . <P> Next day at Minneapolis-St . Paul International Airport , the President was greeted by a shouting crowd of 2,500 , including a corps of red- white-and blue-costumed high school cuties who billed themselves as " Ladies for Lyndon . " At the Minneapolis Sheraton-Ritz Hotel , more than 100 Democrats paid $1,000 each for a presidential cocktail party . Later Lyndon spoke to some 2,000 at a $100-a-plate dinner in the Minneapolis auditorium .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
