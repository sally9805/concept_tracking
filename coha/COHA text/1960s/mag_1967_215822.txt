None could deny that the S.S. Independence was a capital ship for an ocean trip . Adding to the normal opulence of the liner 's staterooms and saloons were ballroom and calypso bands , an assortment of fandango dancers , cabaret singers and social directors , and enough rich food and free Virgin Islands rum ( for those who tired of the domestic champagne ) for a well-sated cruise of indefinite duration-and all at the bargain price of $250 a head . The nation 's Governors , after 58 national conferences ashore , had decided to try the unpath 'd waters for No. 59 . If last week 's excursion between Manhattan and the Virgin Islands was devoid of accomplishment , it provided at least some echoes of the myriad laughter of the ocean waves that Aeschylus once heard . <P> There was robust George Romney , up with the dawn and jogging about the sun deck in his sneakers , later chiding asthenic reporters : " I was up while you fellows were still asleep . " At safety drill , Romney and Ronald Reagan found themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the prescribed orange life jackets , but the putative rivals , jacketless , were plainly determined to either sink or swim on the strength of their own buoyancy . <P> Kismet Kid . When they serve any public purpose at all , Governors ' conferences occasionally allow presidential candidates to win adherents . This time there was no movement . Rhode Island 's John Chafee warned fellow Republican moderates to " get hustling " for Romney . " Now , " said Chafee , " is the time to speak up . " If any new Romney fans did , their words were lost in the cha-cha beat . Lenore Romney pronounced Chafee " brilliant . " The resolutions committee , meanwhile , was deliberating in a chamber aptly named the " children 's playroom . " The more controversial resolutions were either watered down or defeated . <P> Nelson Rockefeller took Bonamine pills to ward off seasickness , but was otherwise chipper . He lectured on the political dividends of promoting culture , huddled a number of times with Romney , and insisted : " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score , Reagan first answered wittily enough : " I have a carry-over from my previous occupation . I never take the other fellow 's lines . " Then Ronnie lapsed into supersincerity by saying that " the convention , the party and the people of the U.S. will make that decision . It is not relevant what someone 's personal desires might be . " Translation for first voters : " Can I help it if I 'm the kismet kid ? " <P> One of the few bits of significant news to develop was Romney 's bulletin that he was buying half an hour of CBS 's prime time on Nov. 15 , when he will substitute for Dundee and the Culhane . Did he intend to announce his candidacy ? That , teased Romney , was a " possibility . "
