txt Now that men have trod the moon , planetary science will never be the same again . Those rock samples , so carefully nested in their vacuum boxes , denote a new order of planetary investigation . Although apparently failing from overheating , their seismograph functioned well enough , if briefly , to indicate the high value of such instrumentation on the lunar surface . Men have gone to another world and seen it for themselves . They sampled its surface and planted instruments no unmanned spacecraft has yet been able to put there . Scientists can never again be content merely to study that world from afar . People ask what scientists have learned from the astronauts ' brief stay in the Sea of Tranquillity . So far , they 've learned very little . The discoveries will come // *Apollo proves value of manned flights // in the months ahead as the samples are studied . Even more will be learned if data comes in from the instruments left behind . But at the important level of awareness of new research opportunities , Apollo 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study the planets with a directness and in detail never possible before . Even as the astronauts headed back to earth , the seismometer placed on the moon was believed to have recorded a shudder  --  the first moon quake ever recorded . If scientists in Houston interpreted the instrument 's squiggles correctly , it means the moon is " alive " like the earth  --  a matter of argument among scientists for years . Prelude to drama The unmanned probes that have scouted the moon , Venus , and even now are heading for Mars , wrote the prelude to this drama . But they could n't have done what astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin Jr , did in a few hours on the moon . And theirs was the simplest of the assignments planned for Apolloutype exploration . No unmanned probe now could gather and return to earth carefully selected samples of moon stuff over the range the astronauts worked . To develop such a probe would involve a costly effort to produce hardware elaborately complex and probably more expensive than the task could justify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laser reflector the astronauts placed on the moon . This was designed to passively reflect light beams sent from earth in precision studies of earth-moon relationships . As of Wednesday , however , it had been a failure . The mirrorlike device designed to reflect the laser beams had yet to be located by astronomers after several attempts . A task for men But putting a tricky instrument like that seismograph in place is again a task easier done by men . An unmanned lender could put down a cruder version of the instrument . However , the ability of men to place and align such equipment could be matched only by needlessly elaborate mechanisms in an unmanned craft . And , in the future , as men roam more widely . over the moon 's surface , as they establish bases , they will far outstrip the capacity of unmanned probes . They will , in crude terms of cost , be the cheapest means of planetary exploration . Dr. Lee DuBridge , presidential science adviser , pointed this out in an interview just before he took office earlier this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men , with their ability to make repairs , to use judgment and change programs , and to gather information , will be the least expensive means of carrying out many kinds of space research . Cost to go down He was thinking of men in earth-orbiting , laboratories as well as on planetary expedi tions .. In both types of activity , unmanned probes will continue to have an impertant , role . But it will take men to bring . many ! of the big advances in knowledge . Also , as space flight develops , the cost ' ? of sending men will go down , and the ease , of doing so will improve . Dr. Thomas Paine , administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administra= tion , emphasized this in a press conference just after Eagle had settled on the moon . The astronauts had taken control of the craft to overshoot their planned landing site by some four miles . The planned site was a shallow rocky crater . It might have wrecked an unmanned craft coming in blindly . Dr. Paine noted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by quick perception and action . Such an ability , he said , outweighs a good deal of the present cost advantage of sending unmanned vehicles to explore the planets . He added that costs of men have already decreased in the Apollo program . He forecast they would drop significantly in the 1970 's , especially as reusable spacecraft are developed . Dr. George Mueller , NASA associate administrator for manned space flight , has put some numbers on the cost savings so far . America 's first satellite , launched by one of Dr. Wernher von Braun 's rockets in 1958 , cost about a million dollars a pound to put in orbit , he notes . Dr. von Braun 's Saturn 5 moonship launcher can orbit payloads at only about $500 a pound . That 's a two-thousandfold cost reduction . That 's only a beginning to Dr. Mueller . " To make space activity the commonplace utility it will eventually be , " he says , " we are going to have to reduce the cost of transport to $50 per pound , and in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space engineers will do this . Of course , transport is only part of the cost of space flight . There are elaborate life-support equipments and other apparatus , to say nothing of complex ground support . But costs everywhere should come down as space flight becomes more common . Advantages loom Costs will tumble both for unmanned and manned missions . However , as space flight does become cheaper , the tremendous advantages of sending men to explore the planets will loom steadily larger . Throughout the 1960 's , it has been fashionable for some scientists to decry what they called the expensive prestige-seeking stunt of manned flight . It 's hard to see how they can maintain that attitude now .
