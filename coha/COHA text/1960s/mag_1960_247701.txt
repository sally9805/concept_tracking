THE WATERS OF KRONOS ( 176 pp. ) - Conrad Richter-Knopf ( $3.50 ) . <P> Life and literature are not as far apart as some critics like to believe , and few books seem truer to life than those in which the author indulges his nostalgia . Writers as various as Marcel Proust , Thomas Wolfe and James Thurber separately discovered that " you ca n't go home again . " In The Waters of Kronos , Novelist Conrad Richter adds an extra dimension to this truism . His hero grasps what countless other men have sensed : you can never really leave home . Novelist Richter has written a dozen books ( The Trees , The Fields , The Town ) in which the American grain stands out like a pledge of authenticity . His latest is guaranteed , with all its flecks of sentimentality , to stir any reader who has ever tried to break away from his home town . <P> When John Donner tries to return from the West to his birthplace in Pennsylvania , he is an old man , and Unionville has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Donner has been ill , and he is perhaps a little unbalanced as well . The local graveyards were moved up to high ground when the valley was flooded , and as he stands before the graves of his family , Donner is swept away by memories . In his fevered imagination , his boyhood Unionville exists again . He walks the streets , peers into houses , recognizes old friends and acquaintances . He even visits his father 's store , and there an old confusion leaves him helpless to speak his feelings . Like many a boy , he had never been able to bridge the distance between himself and his father . Now , as he relives the situation as an old man , the gap seems hardly narrowed . Was his father his enemy , or was he what he seemed to the rest of the town , a cheery backslapper with embarrassing cliches and Biblical quotations ? <P> As Donner 's memory reaches full crest , a whole town passes in review-the poor , the well to do , the occasional suicide or murderer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hard work , kindliness , Pennsylvania Dutch stubbornness and no-nonsense Lutheranism . Now Don ner knows that he loved all this . To the love for his mother , the constant in his life , is now added an insight far different from and more imaginative than the anti-daddy theme so often at the heart of current fiction : " That all those disturbing things seen and felt in the father , which as a boy had given him an uncomprehending sense of dread and hostility , were only intimations of his older self to come , a self marked with the inescapable dissolution and decay of his youth . " <P> On its simplest level , The Waters of Kronos is a long way from being original , but Author Richter 's treatment of his story is , and his style has the pleasurable maturity of old wine . Like most mature writers , he has turned , at 69 , to the secret recapitulations that round out a lifetime ; almost of necessity he is grave , but never boring .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
