All season long , while Notre Dame 's Fighting Irish piled up victory after vic tory , Coach Ara Parseghian played the persistent pessimist . " It is impossible to go through a season undefeated , " he in sisted . " Teams are too evenly matched these days . " Now the only thing that stood be tween Notre Dame and its first perfect season in 15 years was a so-so Southern California squad that had lost three out of nine games . True , U.S.C. had some thing worth fighting for- a possible Rose Bowl bid- but the Irish had some thing worth more : the national cham pionship . " This is our Rose Bowl , " said Coach Parseghian , and few of the 83 , - 840 fans in Los Angeles Memorial Col iseum could have believed in their hearts that they were about to witness the upset of the year . <P> Bookmakers made Notre Dame an eleven-point favorite , and the spread looked puny at half time . A 25-yd. field goal started off the Notre Dame scor ing-and then Quarterback John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's top college player , took charge of the relentless Irish attack . A 21 - yd. pass to All-America End Jack Snow made it 10-0 , and a pitchout to Halfback Bill Wolski hiked the score to 17-0 . In the Southern Cal dressing room , Coach John McKay tried to buoy up his downhearted Trojans : " If we can score the first time we get the ball in the second half , it 's a brand-new ball game . " Upside Down . Southern Cal scored all right , striking 68 yds. in nine plays to cut the gap to 17-7 . But it still seemed like the same old ball game . Time after time , Irish receivers broke into the clear to haul in Huarte 's whistling passes . <P> Notre Dame marched to the Southern Cal 9- only to lose the ball on a fumble Back came the Irish again , and this time Fullback Joe Kantor got the touchdown - only to have it nullified by a holding penalty . By now it was the fourth quarter , and bored sportswriters amused themselves by making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Then everything turned upside down Trojan Quarterback Craig Fertig passed Fred Hill and Rod Sherman made clawing catches , Halfback Mike Garrett slipped away from Notre Dame tacklers as if he were coated with grease From his own 8 , Fertig marched the Trojans to the Notre Dame 23 . Then he rolled out , lofted a pass to Hill in the end zone , and the Irish lead was 17-13 . <P> " Rose Bowl ! " With only 41 min. left , Parseghian decided to eat up the clock ' But now the aroused Trojans held for downs , got the ball back on the Notre Dame 40 , and went to desperate work A run failed , two passes fell incomplete . Finally , on fourth down , chased by Irish blitzers , Fertig threw to Sherman , who skipped into the end zone for the TD that made it Southern Cal 20 Notre Dame 17 . The clock read 1 min. 35 sec . <P> " Rose Bowl ! Rose Bowl ! " screamed Southern Cal rooters . But Notre Dame has never been a quitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whispered briefly in his ear . No deception now ; everybody <P> knew what Huarte was going to do
