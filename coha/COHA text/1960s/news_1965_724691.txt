txt What 's ahead The most extensively integrated American orchestra  --  the Symphony of the New World ? is forming in New York . It will give its opening concert May 6 in Carnegie Hall , followed three clays later by a repeat performance in Harlem . Thirty-six Negro and 52 white musicians will sit in the symphony under the baton of Benjamin Steinberg . Other American orchestras have included Negroes . But none has ever had them in so high a proportion . The orchestra hopes for an orbit outside the traditional concert world . It will play whenever possible ? in communities with low-income families . Music 's most magnificent festivals freque ; , tly fall on birthdays . " ' This year the world will mark three major anniversaries with an outpouring of great music . Helsinki for years has honored the Finnish composer , Jean Sibelius , with a weeklong festival . This year it observes the centennial of his birth . And it is expanding the festivities to three weeks ( May 15-June 4 ) . Several noted artists and four orchestras , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the world 's oldest symphonies , the Musikelskabet Harmonien of Norway , observes its 200th anniversary in Bergen ( May 19-June 5 ) . As at Helsinki , the Cleveland and Berlin orchestras will also perform . Boston 's Handel and Haydn Society , the oldest active chorus in the United States , is marking its 150th anniversary . It started its observance March 28 with the world premiere of " The Passion According to Saint Luke , " a commissioned work by Randall Thompson . In October the Society will host 14 choral groups from 11 nations . A fledgling offshoot from the Metropolitan Opera goes on the road next season . The newly formed Metropolitan Opera National Company will take four operas to 70 North American cities . First performance is scheduled for April 20 at Indianapolis . Twenty-eight singers ? most of them new , young talent ? will make the first tour . They were picked from 1,300 singers after a year of auditions . The troupe will stage Rossini 's " Cinderella , " Bizet 's " Carmen , " Puccini 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Trends ... More color than ever next season may trigger two trends in American television . All but two of NBC 's 29 evening programs will come in color . ABC is hiking its prime evening color shows by at least six hours . And even CBS , the last to surrender to the bigger costs of color , is about to embrace it . With this new emphasis TV may become mostly a spectacle medium at first , with less stress on verbal and intellectual substance . But more new color sets will be sold ? perhaps two million more next year . All new sets must now , by law , include ultra-high-frequency receivers . This would markedly expand the UHF market . And that , in turn , could lead to greater program diversity . Prerecorded tapes are being pushed toward a wider market . Angel Records has put a complete opera on four track stereo tape , recorded at 33/4 inches per second  --  the first major label to do so . The work is Puccini 's " Tosca , " starring Maria Callas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Angel tape of " Tosca " runs slower yet maintains the same high level of sonic quality  --  and at a price no higher than the bulkier stereo disc version . Such pioneering is expected to speed the demand for stereo and hi-fi tapes of serious music . Most buffs of prerecorded music have leaned to popular fare  --  jazz , and light claSsics . How and why ... Back in Hollywood 's heyday , the big studios had plenty of room . They faced out on surrounding empty vistas  --  lots of them . But suburbs and cities have crowded the studios , and land values have ballooned . Old studio lots are now more valuable to developers than directors . Caught in this squeeze is Metro-GoldwynMayer 's 135 acres in Culver City . So MGM has staked out 1,500 acres 30 minutes away by freeway . It hopes to build a vast new studio there with plenty of wide-open vistas . Many believe this site will someday become a massive complex serving three major studios  --  MGM , 20th Century-Fox , and Columbia . Talks to that end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
