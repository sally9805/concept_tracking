THE COLLECTED SHORT STORIES OF CONRAD AIKEN ( 566 pp. ) - World- ($6) . <P> <P> Reading through a big collection of short stories is like staying too long at a noisy party . Individual impressions blur ; one woman waiting uncertainly with an unlit cigarette becomes all women with that mannerism , and a silly remark made once too often makes fools , unfairly , of all who repeat it . Similarly , the impression persists that at least one-quarter of these Conrad Aiken stories begin with characters waking up in the morning , and that most of his women have " the blackest and fiercest eyes I have ever seen . " The repetitions may not be important-short stories are not meant to be read end to end-but they do suggest the limitations of Author Aiken 's range of concern . <P> His prose is unvaryingly correct , well cut and sometimes a little oldfashioned . <P> He describes love affairs frequently , but writes less well of men and women than of men alone . Events are less important to him than inward torment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama . But within these limitations his best stories are of a very high order , and they might seem the product of genius rather than of painstaking craftsmanship if one could not see the techniques of their construction in other , slightly less successful stories in the collection . The familiar Silent Snow , Secret Snow is the prize of the lot-a brilliant evocation of a young boy 's thoughts as he drifts happily into madness . Reality fades as the boy 's mind is diverted to the beauty of a perpetual , invisible snowfall , and this quiet , sifting snow that slowly obliterates the outside world is an instance of the rare , masterfully created literary symbol that never seems literary . <P> Gehenna is a short , impressive interior monologue that dallies with madness , and The Dark City is a skillfully done story of a happy father who , without abandoning his happiness , has a moment 's clear vision of evil . Two other stories - The Last Visit , concerned with adultery , and Mr. Arcularis , which chillingly deals with the no man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully ended in the O. Henry manner . These are the author 's best , and they are a pleasure to read ; few literary telescopes show the dark side of the moon as vividly .
