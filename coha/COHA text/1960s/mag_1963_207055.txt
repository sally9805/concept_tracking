In conceiving of the Alliance for Progress as a bold ten-year program to develop Latin America , planners counted on massive U.S. Government aid-but also on at least $300 million a year in direct U.S. private investment . Instead of plunging in , U.S. investors are pulling out of Latin America ; in the first nine months of 1962 brought home $37 million more than they invested . From three sources last week came ringing indictments of the Alliance and its failure to generate any enthusiasm among businessmen . <P> Profits Low , Risks High . The first indictment came from the 26-man Commerce Committee for the Alliance for Progress ( COMAP ) appointed by Secretary of Commerce Luther H. Hodges to make a businesslike appraisal of the program . Reported COMAP 's Chairman J. Peter Grace , 49 , international-minded president of W. R. Grace &; Co : the Alliance " in its present size and form can not succeed . " Investors are frightened away by the " unfavorable business climate " in Latin America . Profits are low , risks high . The U.S. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with grants and loans to encourage Latin Americans to enact laws more hospitable to private investment . The committee recommended greater tax incentives and deductions as a cushion against heavy losses . Even then , concluded Grace , " it is unlikely that normal conditions attractive to foreign capital can be created for a number of years . " <P> In a separate opinion-later endorsed by Grace-David Rockefeller , president of the Chase Manhattan Bank , and two other COMAP members argued that the incentives and grants are only " stopgap " remedies . In the long run , " encouragement of private enterprise , local and foreign , must become the main thrust of the Alliance . " The U.S. , says the Rockefeller group , " should concentrate its economic aid program in countries that show the greatest inclination to adopt measures to improve the investment climate , and withhold aid from others until satisfactory performance has been demonstrated . " <P> No Joint Effort . Still a third powerful criticism came from the Harvard study group of businessmen and intellectuals who in 1960 sounded the original call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study group complained that the Alliance " is not an alliance . It has lapsed into a unilateral U.S. check-writing program . " The solution , said the group , is for Latin Americans , like Europeans during Marshall Plan days , to join in a regional organization to establish priorities for spending aid money . <P> In 18 months the U.S. has committed $1.6 billion to the Alliance . But the results so far , as COMAP 's Grace says , indicate only that " we are in great danger of suffering a major defeat to our strategic interests in this hemisphere . "
