txt Midwest : Chicago The Supreme Court decision spotlights several Midwest states as prime prospects for congressional redistricting . South Dakota 's First District , for example , has 46 percent more people than the ideal 340,257-district average . The Second District has 46 percent fewer people than the average . Both are rural districts . In Ohio , the urban 12th District in Columbus had 682,962 people as of the 1960 census : the rural 15th District near.Zanesville had only 236,288 people . The congressman from Indiana 's 11th District ( Marion County , Indianapolis ) represents 697,567 people , the congressman from the rural 9th District represents 290,596 . The average district size in Illinois figures out to a population of 420,048 . But the 10th District has 552,582 people ; the 6th District has only 278,703 . In Michigan despite last year 's congressional redistricting legislation , the Upper Peninsula District is 25 percent under the state average of 411,790 : the 15th District in Detroit is more than 20 percent above the average . Tennessee 's Memphis District is 58 percent oversize : its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state average-district size of 396,343 people . As of Feb. 18 , however , the Supreme Court decision had prompted no specific new redistricting pressures in Tennessee , South Dakota , Ohio , or Illinois , although South Dakota and Ohio expect renewed pressures for state legislative action to redraw the lines of congressional districts . ( Most Midwest legislatures will not be in regular session again until January , 1965 . ) More definite reactions to the decision were reported in Lansing and Indianapolis . Michigan Lt. Gov . T. John Lesinki Feb. 18 proposed that the Michigan Legislature be urged to revise its redistricting law of last summer , and August Scholle , director of the state AFL-CIO , threatened to file suit to bring this about . In Indiana former State Sen. Nelson Grills said he will file suit in both state and federal courts to force Gov . Matthew Welsh to call a special session of the Indiana General Assembly to take un them atter of reapportionment . Robert Nelson New England : Boston Political leaders in Connecticut appear resigned to the fact that the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gov . John N. Dempsey is expected to call a special session of the state 's General Assembly for the latter part of March to handle the apparently necessary redistricting . Of the six New England states only Connecticut has what can be considered a wide disparity in the size of the districts represented by its members in the lower branch of Congress . Despite substantial population shifts over the past several decades Connecticut congressional-district boundaries have not been changed since 1911 . And since 1930. when the state became entitled to a sixth seat in the United States House of Representatives , because of increased population , Connecticut has elected the extra congressman on a statewide basis rather than upset existing district-boundary lines . The First District , the state 's largest , now has 689,555 inhabitants , and the Fourth District presently contains 653,589 persons . These compare with the Fifth District , the state 's smallest , which has a population of 318,942 . The disparity between the biggest and smallest district is thus 370,613 persons . George B. Merry West : San Francisco How to effect uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send out of their states to Congress is bubbling briskly on Western legislative stoves . California has an average of 414,000 residents for each one of its 38 congressional districts . The biggest disparity is between the Fifth District , in the city-county of San Francisco , and Los Angeles ' 28th District . The Fifth District has 301.172 residents as compared with Los Angeles ' 28th District with 588,933 residents . The reason the 28th District has 96 percent more than the Fifth stems from a state requirement which provides that assembly districts inside San Francisco must remain intact when congressional districts are formed . Otherwise , the Fifth could have obtained a population slice from San Francisco 's other congressional district , the adjoining Sixth which has 439,144 . Arizona 's First District has 53 percent of the state 's population . The Second District has 30 percent , and the Third District only 17 percent . " I would say this makes Arizona about the third worst state , " in terms of the inequities the Supreme Court is pinpointing , says the University of Arizona 's Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all sure " just which state is first , " or . in this case , the worst . The Arizona Legislature is said to be " scared " about the disparity which shows 663,510 residents in the First District and only 198,236 in the Third . State lawmakers are still debating how to remedy the imbalance . Oregon leaders are well aware of the disparities in their congressional districts . The Second District has only 265,164 residents , while the Third District has 522,813 . The Second District comprises more than half the state , but the sparse eastern half . The Third is a little pocket on the Columbia River that takes in only Multomah County and Portland . Harlan Trott States assess redistricting order : Page 17
