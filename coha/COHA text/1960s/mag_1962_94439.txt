The U.S. has successfully defended the cup 17 times in a monotonous procession of easy victories . In every race since the first in 1851 the U.S. has had the better crew and , with one exception  --  in 1934 , when Britain 's Endeavour challenged  --  has always had the better boat . // This is Australia 's first try for the cup , and this week the Aussie challenger , Gretel ( see cover ) , arrives on the East Coast . Within another week Gretel will be tuning up , in the company of her trial horse , Vim , on the 24-mile America 's Cup course off Newport , R.I. // The challenger is the first 12-meter ever designed or built in Australia . Gretel was born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Australia 's general reputation for imaginative pioneering , has prompted speculation that Gretel might be the first of a new and better breed of 12-meter sloop . // On the eve of Gretel 's debut in U.S. waters her designer , Alan Payne , has released an exclusive preview ( cutaway below ) . To the casual eye there is precious little of Gretel that seems exotic or revolutionary . Considering the rigid rules governing the size , materials and construction of a 12-meter , this is understandable . Of necessity , improvement is limited to subtleties . As Designer Payne admits , " I have n't made any brilliant discoveries ... just tried to make small things a little bit better than ever before . " Australia 's success this September will depend largely on whether all the " small things " add up to a better boat . // Payne took into consideration the fact that the cup is seldom contested in heavy weather . Gretel is designed more for maneuverability than heavy going . Match races are won in seconds  --  and seconds are lost by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide the crew with a responsive boat is implicit in Gretel 's powerful , high-speed deck gear , refined running rigging and hull design . If Gretel 's gear lives up to its expected efficiency , the Australian crew could be cut from a normal complement of 11 to possibly eight , to eliminate weight , windage and confusion . While emphasizing sail-handling ability , Payne has sought to preserve the sail-carrying quality of a strong , stable hull . In fact , in her first runs in Australia Gretel went best to windward in a stiff breeze . This versatile balance of power and quick handling should make her slippery , agile and elusive in tacking duels . More than pure speed , match racing requires a prompt , lively boat that can hold its momentum in sudden turns . // Gretel 's inconclusive trial bouts with Vim in Australian waters this spring served chiefly to train the crew and test her sails . She has 46 sails , and these , as well as her rigging and gear , need further testing , modification and adjustment before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is good enough to win the cup .
