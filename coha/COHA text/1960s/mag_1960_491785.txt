Last fall , when the curtain rang up on the disgraceful spectacle known as the TV Quiz Scandals , cynical observers of the current scene derived a certain wry amusement from watching the various means by which different individuals and groups within the industry attempted to salvage something of their tarnished reputations , Some rallied behind a banner bravely emblazoned " Who , Me ? " Some sought absolution at the public confessional ; others simply clammed up . And at one point the Columbia Broadcasting System tried to remind the public that television did have a loftier side by cadging credit for Broadway 's newest dramatic hit , The Miracle frorker . There was , in fact , a measure of merit to this claim . The play , depicting the struggle of Annie Sullivan , Helen Keller 's teacher , to control the blind , deaf , mute child 's wild rages and open her terrible isolation to the world of communication , had first been presented by CBS on Playhouse 90 in 1957 . And the network 's publicity department wanted to be sure people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated a poignant theme as maturely as the supposedly more sophisticated theater  --  and , what 's more , had done it first . Fred Coe , who produced The Miracle Worker on the stage between assignments for CBS , was accordingly asked to deliver a few kind words to the effect that the introduction of so harrowing a subject to the mass audience was a testimonial to TV 's courage and artistic integrity . Coe refused to play the company game . it was a tribute only to Playhouse 90 , the one show that had the guts to tackle such a tough , factual story , " Coe said . " William Gibson submitted his play to more than a dozen producers , but everybody was afraid of it until he went to Playhouse 90 , which had just gone on the air . The telecast was so faithful to the original script that we merely expanded a few scenes in the transition to the stage . " One of the things that has set Playhouse 90 apart from most other television shows has , indeed , been its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offbeat character studies . It has explored topics ranging from the moral climate in a town after a lynching to the abuses of intense competition for prizes in a children 's summer camp . It has looked into the corrupting influence of power on labor leaders , industrialists and politicians . the neuroses Although Playhouse 90 draws an average audience of 20,000,000 , the industry marks off a major evening show with fewer than 30,000,000 viewers as a disappointment . Advertising and TV executives cite the figures as proof that there are not enough eggheads to justify one of the most expensive operations in the medium . Sponsors pay $355,000 for each hour-anda-half program-5228,000 for air time and 5127,000 for production costs ; but that is only part of the total . CBS foots the bill when the production budget is exceeded , an occurrence on more than half the shows . The two installments of For Whom the Bell Tolls last March ran 5210 , - 000 over the budget . The network also absorbed a heavy loss during the 1958-59 season when one third of the show remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3,000,000 last year . It is an old , melancholy story that culture is an expendable luxury when accountants begin to cast a fishy eye at the cost of supporting it . Rumors popped up about a year ago that sponsors and CBS were ditching Playhouse 90 for a more " popular " format that would fetch a higher rating . Then something with very few precedents happened . Each season some 200TV programs are canceled without a murmur of protest from the millions of people who watch them , but reports of Playhouse 90 's imminent departure brought howls from the public . CBS stations were bombarded with letters that were variations on the same theme : The show was one palatable morsel in a mess of tripe . " Playhouse 90 is a national asset like the Come'die Francaise , " John Crosby declared in his syndicated column . " To me , it 's shocking that the fate of Playhouse 90 should be at the whim of a sponsor , as shocking as if the repertoire of the ComMie Francaise were determined by the guy who owns the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fork Times ' critic , observed : " The fabulously resourceful TV industry has found no difficulty putting pap on a paying basis . But for any program dedicated to the pursuit of creativity and quality , TV still poses a dishearteningly uphill fight . " Motivation experts decided , however , that ratings do not reflect the purchasing power of a loyal , selective audience , and the network announced that Playhouse 90 would be retained  --  but on a biweekly instead of weekly schedule . " The economics of television are all against a weekly hour-and-a-half dramatic show , " said Mike Dann , vice president of CBS programing in New York , " but we never had any intention of dropping Playhouse 90 . We just wanted to cut our loss on air time . Revlon was looking for a show to replace the Sixty-Four Thousand Dollar Question  --  if you 'll pardon the expression  --  and was willing to take The Big Party on alternate Thursday nights . Playhouse 90 became our best program buy as soon as the stiff overhead was reduced , It 's fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blunt truth is we had to keep the Playhouse alive . Nothing in our line-up brings us more prestige . We know there are viewers who do n't watch any other show . Except for a few monthly spectaculars , it 's the only program reviewed by newspapers throughout the country on every turn at bat because it always tries to say something provocative . " Then , just last month , another schedule shift seemed to indicate once again that Playhouse 90 was nearing the end of the line . The program was taken out of its regular slot on alternate Thursday nights , and is now to be telecast at irregular intervals as a special feature . CBS insists , however , that the move was designed not to ease Playhouse off the air but to bolster its impact on the public , and points out that the budget has been increased approximately 540,000 per show to allow the use of more stars . " The change was made to give the series a more glamorous publicity buildup " John Cowdin , the network 's public-relations chief , explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big splash as the only ninety-minute program on the air , but this season there are about two hundred and fifty specials competing for top billing . We believe the best way to insure the future of the Playhouse is to put on the same number of shows , but spot them so that each one will be an event rather than just another program viewers take for granted after a while . " The close attention the trade gives to Playhouse 90 makes it both the most praised and the most criticized program on the air . TV columnists generally watch second-rate dramatic series only once or twice a season because the stupefying repetition of plots defies comment . Their unfavorable reviews , consequently , are scattered pot shots . But when Playhouse 90 puts on a flop  --  and it has had clinkers  --  every critic sees and lambastes after the fashion of a disappointed parent who expects better things of a precocious child . Everyone associated with Playhouse 90 cultivates an attitude of tolerant agreement with the blasts . As a rule , the staffs of shows are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aging sopranos are , but the Playhouse people constantly refer to their failures as though they feel obliged to prove they are not above the imperfections of ordinary folks . The twenty producers , directors , writers and actors I interviewed were like so many reformed sinners racing to admit their past indiscretions . " If a booby prize were given to the director of the worst dog ever put on the air I 'd be a leading contender with both Eloise and Manacle , " says John Frankenheimer , one of TV 's bright young men . " Eloise was a satire on cafe society seen through the eyes of a little girl living at the Hotel Plaza in New York . I had no faith in the story , so I loused it up with music and a mob of celebrities who fell over each other . 1 misinterpreted completely the motivation of Manolete , the famous bullfighter. 1 played it as a death wish instead of a struggle with himself . " Having made his confession , Frankenheimer waits confidently for you to mention , in all fairness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Heavyweight , The Comedian , Old Man and The Days of Wine and Roses . The men who have worked on Playhouse 90 strike no phony poses , though , in taking bows for the show 's chief distinction . This is its resistance to the pressures  --  by sponsors , the network and propagandists  --  which arc responsible for so much banal programming . No group has fought more strenuously or more successfully to present the controversial themes that pump vitality into the electronic gadget sometimes called the " idiot box . " Objections to about thirty of the first 125 plays on the schedule were raised by sponsors on the grounds that the material had limited appeal for the mass audience , or , more importantly , might offend racial , religious or social groups among consumers . Denouncing advertisers who censor ideas that stimulate intelligent discussion of current problems is a popular and worthy pastime . However , a company that spends several million dollars on a program to promote its product may understandably have reservations about arousing prejudices that can result in damaging retaliation at retail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and artistic values in TV , the creative boys generally have as much chance of winning as a taxpayer has of disputing a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service . By contrast , the box score of the arguments over Playhouse 90 's selections tells a different story . It reveals that the opinions of the sponsors and CBS prevailed in just two of the thirty hassles . One script was indeed changed so drastically that the writer felt its significance was destroyed , but the other case involved only two words . The one seriously distorted play was Rod Serling 's A Town Has Turned to Dust , shown in June , 1958 . The story originally was based on the murder of Emmett Till , a fourteen-year-old Negro boy who was killed in Greenwood , Mississippi , in 1955 after he whistled at a white woman . An all-white jury acquitted the woman 's husband and his half-brother of the crime , although a witness identilied them as two of the three men who had abducted the boy . Martin Manulis , the producer of Playhouse 90 , suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after it condoned a lynching . " I told Manulis I had tried to do the identical story for the United States Steel Hoar two years earlier , with a play titled Noon on Doomsday , and l did n't want to be put through the wringer again , " Serling recalls . " Noon on Doomsday was unrecognizable after the sponsor butchered it . The locale was changed from the South to New England , the lynching was eliminated and the characters mouthed nothing but platitudes . " U.S. Steel , on the other hand , contends that Noon on Doomsday was never intended  --  even by Serling himself  --  to be a dramatization of the Till case , and that the changes they requested were merely to improve the quality of what was " a pretty superficial story . " When it came to A Town Has Turned to Dust , Serling says , " Manulis promised he would buck my play through the opposition that could be expected from the six sponsors Playhouse 90 had at the time , but they ganged up on him . We never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Three revisions were demanded in A Town Has Turned to Dust to make it irrelevant to the Till case . The setting was moved to the Southwest in the 1870 's , and the victim was changed from a Negro to a Mexican boy . Serling underscored the moral that bigotry leads to self-destruction by having a guilt-ridden sheriff , who made only a token effort to stop the lynching , commit suicide . One sponsor , the Allstate Insurance Company , vetoed that ending  --  suicide often leads to complications in settling policy claims  --  so the sheriff was dispatched in a gun fight . Although the play was widely lauded , Serling still is resentful that his script was robbed of its pertinence to the headlines . Measured in decibels per word , the loudest rumpus ever kicked up in television was triggered by two words which were not heard on Plit ) 4rouse 90 's Judgment cal Nuremberg last April . The program was based on the postwar trials of Nazis accused by the Allies of genocide . Claude Rains portrayed an American judge presiding at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the presiding judge , Rains struggled to keep his contempt for the defendants from intruding on his unbiased appraisal of the evidence until a visiting Congressman intimated that it would be advisable to treat the Nazis leniently and curry their support for an eventual showdown with the Russians . Then the judge exploded in a denunciation of men who had sanctioned the extermination of innocent people in gas ovens . But the audience had to guess the fate of the victims . At the climax of the speech the sound track was silent for two seconds while Rains ' lips moved . An engineer in Hollywood pulled a switch , cutting the phrase " gas ovens " off the air . The order came from a higher-u p who never has been identified . One of Playhouse 90 's three sponsors is the American Gas Association , Herbert Carlborg , editor  --  a TV euphemism for censor  --  of scripts for the CBS network , had approved the reference togas ovens . " I was watching the show at home and for a moment I thought there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then 1 realized what had happened . It was utterly stupid , unnecessary censorship . " The next day some newspapers upbraided the American Gas Association for throwing its weight behind the switch . " It was a false accusation , " insists Nick Kcesely , the company 's liaison man with the program . " We never objected to the mention of gas ovens for fear that the public would connect our product vv ith the Nazis ' crimes . We merely asked the director to specify that they used cyanide gas . just to be correct technically . He refused to insert that one word , ' cyanide , ' in the speech , but that was as far as we pressed the point . " Television people asserted the incident was exaggerated out of all proportion by newspapers seizing upon an excuse to smear a competitor for advertising . The press retorted that the principle involved warranted the uproar . The affair probably a ill be rehashed if Congress decides , as an aftermath of the quiz scandal , to investigate allegations that the networks ' catering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is detri-mental to the public interest . When the furor subsided , the dramatic department evidently realized that its resistance to pressures had been carried to an absurd extreme in rejecting the valid request on the cyanide gas . It since has co-operated readily on two suggestions from the front office  --  as a concession to international amity . One of these concerned the premiere of the present season . Last July CBS announced Playhouse 90 would open the season on October first with an adaptation of Alas , Babylon , Pat Frank 's novel of a Florida town isolated after a hydrogen-bomb attack on the United States . Three weeks later , following news of Premier Khrushchev 's forthcoming visit , the show was postponed . CBS had good reason to he chary of muddying our relations with the Soviet Union . In September , 1958 , Playhouse 90 had presented The Plot to /gill Stalin , a fictitious story done in documentary style in which Khrushchev hastened Stalin 's death by withholding a medicine that could have saved his life when he suffered a stroke . Mikhail Menshikov , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a filthy slander , " and the U.S.S.R. expelled Paul N iv en , the CBS correspondent in Moscow . " It was a mistake to do the play as a documentary , " Herbert Carlborg concedes . " Our consultant on the script was Harrison Salisbury , The New York Times ' Moscow correspondent , but we should have had positive proof of a conspiracy to murder Stalin and Khrushchev 's complicity in it . " A wary regard for international relations also prompted the other front-office suggestion heeded by Playhouse 90 . David Davidson 's Target for Three , the season 's substitute premiere , told of a revolutionist in an unidentified Latin-American country who became more oppressive than the dictator he deposed . To forestall yelps from Fidel Castro , only one character was permitted to wear a beard . On many occasions the production staff  --  and the audience  --  would have been much happier if sponsors ' objections had been heeded . Another violent reaction was provoked in January , 1959 , by .4 Quiet Game of Cards , put on by Herbert Brodkin despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The story dealt with six successful men who had been meeting in a sociable weekly poker game for years . One player , a merchant bored with prosaic middle age and obsessed by the idea that dangerous gambles are essential to man 's fulfillment , hatched a monstrous scheme . Arguing that a crime was justified if it served a useful purpose , he proposed that the group arouse the town to action against a gang of juvenile delinquents by murdering an elderly high-school principal under circumstances which would make it appear that he had caught the young hoodlums ransacking the school and been killed by them . The merchant 's friends were horrified at first , but finally they confessed that the scheme held a morbid fascination for them and agreed to collaborate on it . At the crucial moment , however , the merchant and an accomplice could not bring themselves to strike the fatal blows . The appalling realization of their moral deterioration hit them a minute later when the principal was killed trying to restrain hoodlums who had broken into the school . " We knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plot after the first rehearsal , " says Barry Sullivan , who played the leading role . " We tried to find a more plausible motive and get around that cornball coincidence at the end , but we could n't come up with a tenable twist . That 's the hazard of doing live TV . There is n't time to whip up a new cast and rehearse another play when you 're stuck with a turkey . We just hoped the audience would accept .4 Quiet Game of Cards as a thriller and forget it as soon as the late movie went on . " Sponsors took a double beating on the show . Never before did so many people miss the closing commercial . CBS executives admit that the switchboards in broadcasting stations throughout the network were swamped with protests immediately after the final curtain . Viewers were indignant that they had been asked to believe men with a sense of community responsibility would resort to the murder of an innocent bystander to solve a social problem . The play also was assailed for spouting an amoral philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brodkin says , " but I do deny the thesis was amoral . Actually , it tried to make the highly moral point that no man can play God . The message did n't come through , but we were handling a pretty abstruse idea , and the higher you aim the harder you fall on your face when you miss . " The show even was attacked for taking an underhanded poke at the hypocrisy of American businessmen . That was the one laugh I got from the mess . I 'm a hidebound Republican , the farthest guy from a liberal or an agitator you ever saw . I go for controversy because it 's good drama . Any show with integrity is bound to offend someone . A play on narcotics addiction will antagonize dope peddlers . I 'd rather irritate people with an honest , provocative story , though , than play it safe and bore them . When viewers arc mad enough to holler , you 've kept them awake , at least . " Actually , however . Playhouse 90 's staff is constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is all the more startling when the subject treated can be expected to arouse protests from organized groups , as was the case last year in two plays which the trade jocularly described as giving equal time to the abuses of labor and those of big business . The Rank and File , a thinly disguised account of Jimmy Hoffa 's career , told how a union was exploited by a labor leader 's lust for power . The network braced for blasts from organized labor , particularly Hoffa 's Teamsters Union , but only one complaint was received . The most admirable character in the play was a labor official , a graduate of New York 's City College , who refused to abandon his principles and go along with the boss . A student at the college groused that the fellow was portrayed as an idealistic jerk . Tire Raider showed the unethical tactics employed by both sides in a proxy fight for control of a corporation . Only two of the several hundred organizations representing industrial managements protested with mild rebukes that the methods depicted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well above the average in sophistication , it bridles at overt references to sex , no matter how delicately the subject is treated . In The Ninth Day , eight people believed they were the sole survivors of the human race seventeen years after an atomic cataclysm . Since the six adults in the group were too old to have children , a boy and a girl just reaching maturity were the only possible progenitors of civilization . The young couple dutifully married and conceived a child , then gradually discovered the romantic as well as the physical aspect of love . The awareness of their 62 T 11 C SAT UltuAY EVEN IN ? pOST ( Continued from Page 60 ) spiritual attachment was the dominant theme , yet many viewers criticized the play for implying that the basis of marriage was no different from the prearranged mating of animals . Special care was taken last spring to avert squeamish protests to In Lonely Expectations , a psychological study set in a home for unwed mothers . Attention was focused entirely on girls whose misguided search for affection had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give a typical cross section of parents ' attitudes , to spell out the girls ' anguish when their babies were put out for adoption , and to project the bleak atmosphere of such an institution . Men reacted much more sympathetically to the program than mown , who were outraged that their families had been exposed to a discussion of illegitimacy . A hca v y percentage of the mail from women berated the show for encouraging promiscuity by making the institutions too cozy or excusing the girls ' disgrace by saddling the blame on their parents . During its comparatively brief run Playhouse 90 has stumbled repeatedly over the mass audience 's curbs on sex , but the show has made a sizable dent in another TV taboo  --  against the downbeat , or unhappy , ending . In the never-never land of escape entertainment , all brides are beautiful , malefactors go to their dooms and the virtuous live happily ever after . On Playhouse 90 , however , villains do not always get their comeuppance , characters inspired by noble motives sometimes wind up with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently falls on a situation holding no promise of relief from despair . Downbeat endings have featured so many of its award-winning shows that the device is a trade-mark of Playhouse 90 . Two notable examples last year were Old Man and The Days of Wine and Races . The latter play concerned a young couple who were chronic dipsomaniacs . With the help of Alcoholics Anonymous , the husband finally managed to straighten himself out , but when he tried to reform his wife , she refused to give up her glass crutch . The last scene showed her walking out on him and their child , murmuring , " Everything looks so small and shabby in the daylight . " In Old Man , adapted from a story by William Faulkner , a convict sentenced to fifteen years on a Louisiana chain gang was assigned temporarily to rescue work during the great Mississippi flood of 1927 . After saving a pregnant woman at the risk of his life the convict could have escaped , but his peculiar sense of obligation to society impelled him to surrender . The warden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , covered up his mistake by listing him as a captured fugitive , an offense that added ten years to his sentence . The convict accepted the penalty stoically : " If that 's what the law says , I reckon you got to abide by it . " For a while reviewers were inclined to go overboard for Playhouse 90 's downbeat endings as a welcome change of pace from the happy hokum cloying the air . During the last year , however , they have remarked on numerous occasions that the program 's emphasis on taut realism smacks of arty pretension . Rod Serling , who has contributed his share of grim scripts , was asked what he thought of the comment . " It 's perfectly true , " Serling said . " When you work on the Playhouse you have a tendency to climb on a soapbox and yell , ' Look how adult 1 am , ma ! ' I 've been guilty of it myself , so I know a deliberate pitch is made for the snob appeal of downbeat endings . Everyone who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's what makes it unique . " Editor Herbert Carlborg confirmed Serling 's analysis . " More leniency is permitted Playhouse 90 than any program on the network because its high quality tempers complaints . We know some material will offend parts of the audience , but no apology is necessary when it is treated with dignity . " A possibly more realistic explanation for Playhouse 90 's relative freedom from pressures was given by Guy DellaCioppa , vice president of CBS programing in Hollywood . " The three sponsors cancel out each other 's objections , " he said . " This is one case where the heavy expense of a show is an advantage . If one sponsor were footing the hill , he would want to use innocuous stories , but with two other companies in the picture he does n't have absolute control of the show . Playhouse 90 is closer to the editorial independence of newspapers and magazines than any other dramatic show , A publication has so many advertisers that one can not dictate its policy and , to a limited degree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the show also is a big factor in their hands-off attitude . " One test of the latitude that sponsors grant shows is their willingness to pay extra for quality , and Playhouse 90 always has held a favored position in this area . It was the first program to give creative people  --  writers and directors  --  the same fees as performers . At the time . in 1956 , the top price in the business for scripts was 53500 . Playhouse 90 set a minimum of 57500 and offered up to 510,000 , the maximum then paid to an actor . And until the recent budget increase , i he director of a show generally received the same fee-510,000 ? as the star . Another thing that sets Playhouse 90 apart  --  and leads to all sorts of complicaLions  --  is the production staff 's insistence on doing the plays as live performances . With few exceptions , most dramatic programs are presented on film or electronic tape , a procedure that enables the director to reshoot a scene when an actor muffs a line or something goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain that the technical and artistic quality of a play suffers when it is filmed in advance of the actual showing . " That 's an argument heard only in New York , where the boys want to get a monopoly on big dramatic shows , " says Hubbell Robinson Jr. , who originated Playhouse 90 and is now an independent producer . " It was valid a few years ago , but electronic tape has been improved so much thatan expert ca n't tell the difference between a live and a taped show today . " John Frankenheimer disputes his former boss . " When a play is taped in short , interrupted sequences , actors lose the spontaneity and continuity of a live performance . They do n't give their best efforts because they know a scene can be done again if it is n't right the first time . A cast is hopped up psychologically when there 's no margin for error . " Spontaneity can , of course , also entail headaches , especially when a cast is creating characterizations in an original play . Someone invariably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shambles of the show , The worst nightmare was Diane Varsi 's attack of the jitters in February , 1959 , in The Diuguling Girl , her TV debut . Miss Varsi missed a week of rehearsal , recovering from a nasty facial injury suffered while making a movie . And when she did report to Playhouse 90 she was disturbed by the emotional problems which caused her to quit Hollywood three weeks later . On a taped show there would have been ample time to replace Miss Varsi in the leading role , but Playhouse 90 had to stick with her and sweat out her strained performance . The telecast of In Lonely Expectations almost ended tragically when Susan Harrison , a young actress getting her first big chance , was so carried away by her emoting that she fell down a flight of stairs . Fortunately she was not hurt , and few viewers realized that the fall had not been written into the script , but for an agonized moment everyone 's heart seemed to freeze . Comedians have in some respects been the worst offenders . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy dramatic roles that funnymen traditionally yearn to play , Jack Carson put so much undisciplined intensity into one show that the network had to assure many viewers he had not been drunk during the performance . Art Ca rncy , impersonating a writer who sacrificed everything for success , changed the interpretation of The Velvet Alley by going into his emotional breakdown five minutes too soon . Nor are comedians the only actors who occasionally get the bit in their teeth . " Rod Steiger had a field day in A Town Has Turned to Dust , " Serling recalls . " He stretched a juicy death scene at the climax right into the closing commercial . " At that the most costly flights of runaway enthusiasm have not been those of the actors at all . The 5440,000 expense tab for the two installments of For Whom Nye Bell Tolls last March contained an item that could have been designated as : " Gratifying staff 's whim  --  S150.000 . " We were hooked when Fred Coe , the producer , and John Frankenheimer , the director , got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a program supervisor at the time . " They were convinced that Jason Robards Junior , was the only living actor who could play the lead . That meant the show had to be done in New York because Robards was appearing on Broadway in The Disenchanted . I tried to tell them Hollywood was full of competent actors as good as Robards and that we had much better facilities here for the outdoor scenes , but they would n't listen . On any other show Coe and Frankenheimer would have been ordered to fit an actor to the budget , but you 're not supposed to annoy Pla ) . house 90 's creative artists with mundane problems about money . They got Robards . " The chief supporting roles went to Maureen Stapleton and Eli Wallach , costars of another Broadway play , The Cold Wind and Nye Worm . Since three principals were tied up with stage commitments , most of the rehearsals could not begin until midnight , a factor that necessitated four weeks of overtime pay for technicians . Among other things , I 0,000 square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses had to be hauled to a studio on New York 's lower East Side . For all that , the ambitious project left the critics cold . The majority panned it as a sprawling , contrived show . " They were right , " Coe says . " The play was n't suitable for TV , but I do n't regret taking a shot at it . 1 like to think it was a distinguished disappointment that was good publicity for the industry . " The funny part of the whole thing is that the sponsors felt the same way about it . The three participating companies squelched rumors of Playhouse 90 's finish by renewing their options for this season . " We bought the show again for the touch of class it gives us , " says adman Mickey Johnson , who represents the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company . " We sponsor eight other shows , but none of them has the Playhouse 's prTeslitiEge. , NWDe like to stand on the side lines and let it splash on us. "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
