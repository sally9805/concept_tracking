To hot , rainy Monrovia last week came 16 heads of government and four senior ministers from 20 independent African nations . The occasion : the African Heads of Government Conference , the largest African summit meeting ever held . <P> Though the host and chairman was President William Tubman of Liberia , the man chiefly responsible for the conference was Flix Houphouet-Boigny ( pronounced hoof-K&gt; boyn-yee ) , 55 , President of the flourishing Ivory Coast . A physician and plantation owner who served for 13 years in the French Assembly before his country became independent , Houphouet-Boigny is a sharp contrast to the rabble-rousers who make most of Africa 's news , and he is slowly gaining respect as a leader who recognizes that shrill demagoguery is no solution to Africa 's ills . Months ago he conceived the idea of a conference of all African leaders , with the modest aim of soberly exploring their common problems . As it turned out , the delegates who came to Monrovia represent a majority of independent Africans - some 95 million of free Africa 's 186 million citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.A.R. , Morocco , Guinea , Ghana and Mali ( the Congo and South Africa were not invited ) . Originally , Guinea 's Sekou Toure and Mali 's Mobido Keita accepted . But Ghana 's Kwame Nkrumah , who destroys everything he can not lead , talked them both out of going . <P> Chosen : the West . As chief of by far the most populous country represented . Nigeria 's Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa did most of the talking . The participants agreed on their " unswerving loyalty ' ' to the U.N . They censured the arrest of Katanga 's Moise Tshombe in the Congo , nuclear testing , South Africa 's racial policies . They laid the groundwork for technical and economic cooperation , scheduled a second meeting in Lagos later this year . But as Houphouet-Boigny planned , the conference was primarily an initial , amiable stab at getting acquainted . <P> Houphouet-Boigny has already modeled his hopes for Africa in miniature in the " committee of Brazzaville , " the economic union of twelve former French West Africa states set up last month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , Houphouet-Boigny says : " We have chosen , frankly , the West . We do not wish to engage in war ; we do not wish to have the enmity of any group . But we know how to choose our friends : those who will not impair our liberty . " Houphouet-Boigny would ultimately like to see the same sort of solidarity emerge from the Monrovia nations . " Our hope is that Africa will become a huge Switzerland . " <P> Houphouet-Boigny is well aware of the wreckers . " We see the Russian efforts on our continent at the moment , encouraging a policy of hate and war between Africans . If we are naive enough to sever relations with the West , in the end we will be invaded by the Chinese , and the Russians will impose Communism on us . " <P> To the U.S. , which has tended to open its cold war purse strings in areas where it was scared rather than where it was confident , Houphouet-Boigny 's inference is plain : the West would do well to watch - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
