txt One month ago I would have accepted unquestioningly your editorial of June 7 characterizing as ill-considered the action of the Senate in- voting to ban all foreign aid to countries dominated by communism or Marxism . Today I question whether we should extend substantial foreign aid to any of the countries in Europe and Asia . Your conclusion that the Senate action is foolishness triumphant is not readily accepted , if based on the position that economic aid ex , tended ' to the countries of the world has in most cases redounded somehow to the benefit of the United States . Our people ought to know that , as any intelligent , observant traveler can testify , we are throwing most of this money away if we think we are getting any favorable result in terms of gratitude or a willingness on the part of Europeans to eschew communism . Attitude Toward U. S. With a Falangist guide , I recently toured Spain . It took very little questioning to find out that the middle and upper classes hold America in contempt , in sharp contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are everywhere evident as tourists and business proprietors . The people are generally sure that the United States is paid back  --  by Spain  --  for instance , usuriously . The attitude was dramatically summed up for me by a conservative Spanish intellectual who told me that our foreign aid is regarded as intended to keep autocratic government in power , to maintain the status quo . When I asked this thoroughly educated-professional gentleman whether Americans like me should use this argument to convince our naive Congressmen that we are throwing our money away , he said , " No . If you stop giving this money our workers who now make less than a dollar a day will be worse off . " This incident sums up the story from one end of Spain to the other . This ambivalent attitude on the part of our beneficiaries emphasizes the fact that this role of brother 's keeper is suspect . Deprived Classes But I go further ; I saw and heard enough of the Spanish people to know that the word communism means to too many deprived people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They see nothing in the American capitalistic system , because their own Government and their upper classes as well as their radical agitators peddle the same sort of slander as does Russia about an America whose streets teem with beggars who by the millions give the lie to our vaunted prosperity . I am no longer convinced that our experts in the Truman and Eisenhower Administrations knew all the answers . I am no longer convinced that the answer to the economic and political unrest that pervades most of the world lies in the free use of money that we can not afford to keep throwing away . I am certainly not convinced that if we stop giving Spain , Yugoslavia and other countries money ( as distinguished from food that might be necessary to fend off starvation ) in the hope of thwarting Moscow , the Reds will take our place by providing the aid that we have been giving all of these people . It has not been demonstrated that Russia has the means . I am convinced , in short , that the American people must make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in our monetary power to straighten out the world . HARRY G. LIESE . New York , June 7 , 1962 . Relief for Car Owners Asked To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Commissioner Barnes ' romantic statement to describe the flow of traffic on Broadway , i. e. , " just beautiful , " can also and fallaciously describe a resort town 's feelings when the people who have made it alive during the summer months suddenly leave and take their business with them . Mr. Barnes also stated poetically that of course business men would complain about the new traffic regulations , but that New York City streets were no place to park cars . And using another philosophical approach to the traffic problem , Mr. Barnes suggested that it would take five years to untangle . Judging from what is happening to certain business areas of the city , Mr. Barnes might do just that . In about five years his operation would be a huge success , except that the patients , in this case the small business man , the wholesaler and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in this city ) , will have died beyond revival . So far as the car owner is concerned , it only aggravates him to pay a city sales tax , or a compensating use tax , and various gasoline taxes only to find that he can not use his car in the city unless he wants to be ticketed , look for a metered parking space which usually is n't there , or pay up to $3 a day to park his car in a garage or lot ! Whatever happened to the city garages which were supposed to have ' been built , together with the low parking rates ? If the paying customer supports the economy of any city , especially one the size of New York , and the car owner is an ' essential part of this economy , it is up to the city administration to make the use and parking of cars a pleasure and not the hardship that it is now . SAMUEL H. SCHWALB . New York , June 5 , 1962 , Reporting on Fall-Out Statement That Testing Poses No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YORK TIMES : Will the American public actually share in its Government 's relief that " fall-out from nuclear tests through 1961 may result in forty deaths a year from bone cancer and leukemia in the present population of the United States and cause serious genetio defects in 110 children of the next generation " and that this is negligible because " the danger of harmful effects from fall-out is small in comparison to the danger of miniilar sicknesses from natural causes " ? Will the American public be reassured to learn that these results of extensive Government study " played a key part in the Presidential decision that the United States could resume atmospheric testing without posing an undue health hazard to the world 's population ? " That anything causing forty deaths to innocent persons a year and serious genetic defects in 110 children of the next generation can be considered a negligible health hazard proves to what sophistry we have come . Are we so conditioned to the commercials for the " better " smoke , the " better " car , the " better " deodorant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than what " . ? Why bother to seek cures for polio when more people die from cancer ? Why bother to stamp out crime in San Francisco , say , when there is a higher rate in New York ? Probably fewer people die from slipping on icy sidewalks than do from tumbles in slippery tubs , but should the city then take no steps to keep the sidewalks clear ? Have these forty people who are to die each year , these 110 Ohildren to be born with serious genetic defects been asked if they axe prepared to be our tribute to thee Mino-taur ? No man has the right to say that such innocent victims are to die as a means to an end , Such sophistry and inhumanity should shock the nation as it seldom has been shocked , but I fear there will be little more reaction than fruitless letters such as this . JOHN GOODWIN . New York , June 3 , 1962 . Mental Ills Under Medicare To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The Administration 's answers to questions on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Times on June 1 may lead to some misunderstanding regarding coverage of costs for hospital care for mental illness . It is true that the plan would not pay for stays in mental or tuberculosis hospitals , This is the traditional exclusion under Federal public assistance laws because of responsibilities normally carried by state governments . However , the King-Anderson bill would include payments for hospital care of an eligible person treated for mental illness in a general hospital . In other words , the illness is not the criterion , but rather the nature of the institution in which the care is provided . This is an important distinction in view of the increasing use of general hospitals for short-term treatment of the mentally ill . Last year more patients were admitted for psychiatric treatment in general hospitals than were admitted to mental hospitals . Discharges after relatively short periods of hospitalization for mental illness demonstrate that these illnesses can and should be covered under any insurance provision ? private or public  --  to help people meet hospital costs .
