The Dodger left-hander did not even equal the mark of 18 strikeouts , a feat achieved by only two men , including himself , since 1900 . He did , however , match a performance equaled by 43 other National Leaguers since 1900  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Moeller and Stan Williams hurt the Dodgers . Podres failed for the ninth and 10th consecutive times to complete a game , Moeller for the 11th and 12th times ; Williams gave up 10 runs in 10 innings . At home the team record was only 19-17 . Philadelphia finished its best home stand in five years ( 9-4 ) and climbed to seventh . After his first complete game in nearly a year , Chris Short was asked why he was two minutes late coming to bat in the fifth inning . " I was changing my sweat shirt and the buttons kept popping every whichway , " Short answered . St. Louis batters were hitting every whichway : .289 BA , 53 runs and a team high of 11 homers for the week . And there were shutouts by Cardinals Larry Jackson , Ray Sadecki and Curt Simmons . New York had neither good hitting nor good pitching . The Mets proved to be opportunists , however , scoring 10 runs on just four hits in one game . Their secret : 16 walks from the Dodgers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done better had they not hit into so many double plays . In one game they hit into five , raising their total to 71 and putting them on course for the league record of 166 set by the 1958 Cardinals . Pittsburgh was inconsistent , losing by scores such as 4-3 and 5-0 and winning by 13-3 and 17-7 , but hung on to third place . Chicago was even more erratic . The Cubs started the week by winning a doubleheader , then three days later they were shut out twice . Chicago did get four wins , two by 21-year-old Cal Koonce , who pitched the team 's first complete game in 24 tries , and two by 33-year-old Bob Buhl . Interspersed were five losses , more than enough to keep Mrs. Charlie Metro , wife of the Cubs ' head coach , well fed . Her husband takes her out to dinner each time the Cubs lose . Houston 's Dick Farrell dined on aspirins . He took nine one day to deaden the pain in his side . Farrell then pitched his third straight three-hitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In all , the Colt .45s batted .207 and lost four of five . Don Mc-Mahon had one exceptionally bad day . After missing the team bus for the trip from New York to Philadelphia , he hurried to the railroad station , missed a train and had to wait an hour for the next one . That night he worked in relief and gave up a hit that beat Houston . Cincinnati Coach Pete Whisenant had somewhat the same trouble . He received a phone call in his hotel room at 12:30 p.m. urging him to rush to Candlestick Park for a 1 o'clock game . Whisenant smiled : he knew the Reds were playing a night game . Minutes later Manager Fred Hutchinson called . It was n't a night game . As it turned out , the Reds would have been better off had they not shown up : they lost three games to the Giants . One of the Reds ' defeats came when San Francisco 's Ed Bailey hit a grand slam off Joey Jay , one of his partners in the J &amp; B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bob Bolin each won twice as the Giants took over first place . // AMERICAN LEAGUE He began his career as a catcher , but when he broke his left hand he pitched batting practice to stay in shape . Since then Earl Wilson of Boston has always been a pitcher . His closest link with Sandy Koufax was the obscure fact that he was born in the same year , 89 days before the Dodger pitcher back in 1935 . Last week , four days before Koufax pitched his no-hitter , Wilson became the 52nd American Leaguer to pitch a no-hit game . Lou Clinton and Gary Geiger each hit three homers , and Bill Monbouquette pitched a four-hitter and a five-hitter as the Red Sox won five of seven . New York had the same record . The Yankees won the longest game ever played ( seven hours ) when Jack Reed hit a home run in the 22nd inning against the Tigers . Reed had the bunt sign on the first pitch but was allowed to swing away at the second . Two days later the Tigers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cleveland 's Al Luplow noticed that the bunt sign was off . He faked a bunt on the next pitch , took a short backswing and hit a two-run homer . Catcher John Romano was bruised on the head , collarbone and both legs by foul balls in one game , but Manager Mel McGaha was even more concerned that his team lost five of seven . Kansas City 's Dick Howser was more badly hurt : he suffered a broken bone in his hand . His replacement , former Angel Billy Consolo , had seven hits in his first 12 at bats . Chicago did not even average that many hits a game . The White Sox did score 19 runs , all after two were out , and won three games . Although Detroit went 31 innings without scoring , the Tigers , mostly thanks to shutouts by Jim Bunning , Paul Foytack and Hank Aguirre , split eight games . Rocky Colavito 's .412 hitting and 10 RBIs also helped . There were 11 shutouts in the AL , with Baltimore 's Milt Pappas and Steve Barber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wrong end of a shutout for the fifth time , losing 1-0 . Los Angeles ( see page 16 ) won games with home runs , sacrifice flies , hitting splurges and good relief , and stayed in the pennant fight . Poor relief work cost Minnesota four games . Camilo Pascual shut out the Yankees , but that win was drowned in six losses . Washington played tight ball , and although the Senators lost four of seven , they never finished more than three runs behind . Fine pitching by Claude Osteen ( 22 ) , Steve Hamilton ( 25 ) , Tom Cheney ( 27 ) and Dave Stenhouse ( 28 ) enabled the Senators to cut their team ERA from 5.96 to 4.19 in eight weeks . This did not bring many victories , but it gave the Senators a youthful , if last-place , appearance. // Boxed statistics through Saturday , June 30
