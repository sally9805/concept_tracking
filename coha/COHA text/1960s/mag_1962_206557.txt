There was a time when the West counted the anniversaries of the Russian Revolution with some hope that one year the Communist regime would collapse . That time is long past . Russia celebrated the Revolution 's 45th anniversary last week , and as revolutionary regimes go , 45 years is a considerable stretch . In the 4 decades following the French Revolution , for instance , democracy toppled monarchy , the bloody Terror crushed democracy , Bonapartism replaced terrorism , and despotism succumbed to the restoration of Bourbon royalty . <P> In the same span of time , the Russian regime , which Lenin thought could last scarcely three months , has had its own brief democracy , its own long terror , its own despotism . Never mentioned in the anniversary speeches are the 1,500,000 who died in the three-year civil war , the 10,000,000 who perished in the famine of the ' 20s and in Stalin 's later ruthless collectivization drives , the 7,000,000 to 10,000,000 who were imprisoned or murdered in the maniacal purges of the ' 30s and ' 40s , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in open war or secret terror all over the world . <P> Khrushchev himself bases his whole political posture and power on a condemnation of these Stalinist " excesses . " That is supposed to settle it . While no one seriously today predicts a return to Stalinist terror , the fact remains that the philosophy that made the terror possible has in no way been repudiated , but only softened around the edges . Yet in the West there is a growing tendency to shift all the guilt and all the villainy to " Stalinist " Red China and to presumed pro-Chinese partisans within the Kremlin . <P> Smile for the Camera . The fact that Moscow is no longer the undisputed capital of world Communism , and that there is , unquestionably , a Sino-Soviet split ( see following story ) , is once again reviving the old , tempting speculation that some day Russia and the West will make common cause against China . Historian Arnold Toynbee suggested years ago that Christian Russia and the Christian West would stand together against the Chinese . Later , France 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe " ( Russia ) faced with the " yellow masses of China . " Now aging Pundit Walter Lippmann argues that " the true interest of Russia is to make peace in Europe and , with the West . . . to recognize that the containment of Red China is becoming more important than any other Soviet interest . " <P> This pipe dream was reinforced by Red China 's attack on India . Furthermore , according to some weird reports from the Caribbean last week , the U.S. and Russia seemed joined in a cordial effort to defuse Castro 's Cuba . If one could believe the stories , some Soviet skippers happily waved and peeled tarpaulins off missiles on their decks for the benefit of U.S. surveillance cameras . One Red crew even sent a bottle of vodka up to the pilot of a hovering U.S. Navy helicopter .
