In the last year before Castro , Cuba had 6,600 physicians ; since then , 2,000 doctors have fled Cuba , and 1,500 of them are in the U.S. A fortnight ago , in a Miami auditorium , the " Faculty in Exile " of the University of Havana 's once highly rated School of Medicine graduated 152 exiled doctors who had taken its refresher course in medicine and qualifying courses in English . After that , the doctors took the tough screening examination set up by the U.S. Educational Council for Foreign Medical Graduates ; about 80% are expected to pass . Since most states make U.S. citizenship a prerequisite , the Cubans still can not get licenses to practice privately . But there is a big and insistent demand for them in doctor-starved public hospitals . So Castro 's loss is a U.S. gain . <P> Miami 's efforts to fit refugee Cuban doctors into U.S. medicine , to restore their self-respect and to make use of their skills , originated in an unfortunate incident a little more than a year ago . A difficult emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of a long , hard day , and nerves were frayed as the surgeons hurried to get out of the operating room . Even so , a surgeon trained in Cuba was shocked to hear a colleague bark at a male scrub nurse : " Get out of my way , you Cuban nigger ! " The surgical nurse was an exile who had been a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Havana . <P> Slash the Red Tape . The story got to Dr. Ralph Jones Jr. , chairman of the University of Miami 's Department of Medicine . An expert at slashing red tape , " Buck " Jones moved fast . " By noon of next day , " he says , " we had found nearly a third of the Havana medical faculty-working as nurses and orderlies , or opening lobsters in restaurants , or running cars at the beach hotels . " By that night , in a gallant gesture , Dr. Jones put all the Cuban medical teachers on salary as visiting professors at his own school . <P> Obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other Cuban doctors - many of them with some U.S. medical training-living around Miami . So with a core group of Cubans from the Havana University staff ( all but half a dozen of the 155 pre-Castro professors and assistants have fled ) , Buck Jones set up the Faculty in Exile . With U.S. volunteers joining in as tutors , the Cubans were offered a total of 80 hours a week free in graduate medical courses , plus English . <P> By last week , 700 of the 900 who took the faculty 's courses had passed the Educational Council exams . <P> Psychiatric Training . Almost to a man , the doctors say that they left Cuba because they could not stomach the loss of freedom under Castro-for themselves as physicians , for their children as future citizens . Castro 's policies have made a mockery of medicine . To head one reputable clinic , the regime nominated a janitor . In a major clinic it installed the barber as administrator , with the switchboard operator as his assistant . Says one displaced doctor : " Practice is terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other antibiotics , no hormones . If you need another medicine , you may have to phone dozens of pharmacies to get it . " * <P> One who quickly made good in the U.S. <P> is Dr. Sergio Leiseca , 40 , who had several years of U.S. training in pre-Castro days .
