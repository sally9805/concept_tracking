Any multimillionaire can surely afford to seek out the world 's best medical care . If he happens also to be the father of the President of the U.S. , his search can command unlimited assistance . But picking a hospital for Joseph P. Kennedy , victim of a severely paralyzing stroke five months ago , was no problem at all . Last week the former ambassador was flown to the world 's largest hospital of its kind : Manhattan 's pioneering Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation , overlooking the East River at 34th Street . That Kennedy could face a long program of intensive treatment was evidence of how much he had improved . <P> The 73-year-old patient was indeed a special guest . He was put up in Horizon House , a five-room , ranch-style home built on the institute grounds as a demonstration model of a stepless , stairless dwelling tailored to the needs of wheelchair patients . There , visits from his anxious family would be more convenient than if he were in one of the usual four-bed wards . But Kennedy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more non-millionaire Americans who are the victims of similar strokes , and the measures to be taken to treat those problems will be the same . <P> Dominant . President Eisenhower and Sir Winston Churchill had relatively mild strokes from which they recovered fully and quickly . Ike had no limitation of movement , and the slurring of his speech lasted only a few days . Joe Kennedy 's case is far more typical . A clot clogged an artery and cut off the blood supply to a major part of the left side of his brain . <P> Since he is righthanded , this left hemisphere of his brain was dominant ; in it are the nerve controls for muscles on the right side of his body . Perhaps even more important , the left hemisphere contains the language center through which he receives and interprets the written or spoken word , and formulates ideas to be expressed in words . <P> The hemiplegia ( " half paralysis " ) in such cases tends to fall into a set pattern , and treatment is similarly standardized . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the leg . If a patient can lift his arm at all . or if he can raise his leg an inch from the bed , chances are good that he will be able to walk again . <P> Inactivity is the patients ' worst enemy ; their muscles atrophy and tendons shrink . <P> At the institute , the basic therapy is to see that patients have little idle time . <P> Compulsive . Most hemiplegics are compulsive personalities , which may be why they get strokes . " Our patients are used to moving fast and getting things done . " explains Jack Hofkosh , 40 , chief of physical therapy . " They like the busy pace here at the institute . Though rehabilitation is necessarily slow and monotonous , the patients put in a grueling day , with their every activity directed toward resuming a normal life . "
