Surgeons listened in wonderment when Dr. Irving S. Cooper first described his " ice scalpel " and a new way to shoot liquid nitrogen through the brain to freeze part of the thalamus as a treatment for Parkinson 's disease ( TIME , July 6 , 1962 ) . Now , Dr. Cooper 's cold is surgery 's hottest technique - a tool for treating a dozen or more conditions in all parts of the body . <P> Called cryosurgery , from the Greek kryos ( cold or frost ) , the new method actually involves neither ice nor scalpel . The surgeon inserts a thin cannula ( tube ) that kills offending tissue with liquid nitrogen 's intense cold ( - 196 C. , or 321 below zero F. ) . Usually no tissue is actually removed , and the body 's natural clean-up system removes the debris . Virtually bloodless and almost painless , cryosurgery can be done on patients who remain fully conscious or only lightly anesthetized . In some cases cryosurgery is used only to relieve symptoms , but in others it achieves actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise : <P> PITUITARY GLAND . Just about the hardest part of the body for a surgeon to get at is the pea-sized pituitary gland ( see diagram ) , producer of a few master hormones that govern the production of dozens of " slave " hormones . An overactive pituitary causes Cushing 's syndrome , some forms of gigantism and adult overgrowth , and some cases of virilism in girls and women . Removal or deactivation of even a normally active pituitary helps some patients with advanced cancer of the breast or prostate , and diabetes victims going blind from bleeding of retinal arteries . <P> Merely to locate the pituitary , encased in a bony box like a bomb shelter in the middle of the skull , is a highly delicate , dangerous procedure , and surgeons have tried several approaches . Dr. Robert W. Rand and his team at U.C.L.A. go in through the nasal passages and the sphenoid bone that lies behind them . First , the patient 's head is clamped in a stereotactic device that enables the surgeons to take bearings in three dimensions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ultracold cannula . Dr. Rand found that temperatures as low as - 70 C. maintained for as long as 17 minutes had no appreciable effect on the stubbornly resistant pituitary . So he dropped the temperature inside the gland to between - 170 C. and - 190 C. With a probe-or sometimes with two , one in each lobe-held at this freeze level for 15 minutes , Dr. Rand 's group has safely achieved the desired degree of pituitary destruction in more than 50 cases . Other neurosurgeons agree that for the pituitary , the supercold technique is " superior to all the rest " - such as scooping out the pituitary with a tiny , long-handled spoon , always with the danger that too much of the pituitary would be left . <P> TUMORS . A noncancerous but far from benign tumor is the angiofibroma , which develops in the nasal passages and equips itself with a huge blood supply . When the tumor is removed by ordinary surgery , patients lose an average three pints of blood ; some have lost as much as eight , and died on the operating table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dr. Mansfield F. W. Smith pioneered a cryo-surgical technique for the removal of angiofibromas with negligible bleeding .
