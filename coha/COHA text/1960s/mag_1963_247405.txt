When Fred J. Borch was named executive vice president of General Electric 15 months ago , the implication was as blaring as the horn on a G.E . diesel locomotive ( TIME , Aug. 10 , 1962 ) . The post has existed only off and on in G.E . ' s history , and is usually reactivated to accommodate an heir apparent . By picking Vice President Borch for it , the board cleared the way for the retirement of Ralph Cordiner , chairman and longtime chief executive . Cordiner has wanted to retire to his 1,800-acre West Florida cattle and citrus ranch , but postponed his departure long enough to untangle the lengthy list of suits arising from 1960 's price-fixing decree against G.E . and 28 competitors . Last week Cordiner , 63 , announced that he will step down in December . President Gerald Phillippe , 54 , will move up to chairman , and Borch , at 53 , will become the president and chief executive of the nation 's fourth largest manufacturer . <P> No Room for Stumbles . Brooklyn-born Fred Borch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in remarkably good shape . The major credit goes to Ralph Cordiner , who succeeded Charles E. ( " Electric Charlie " ) Wilson as chief executive in 1950 and promptly ordered the most drastic reorganization in G.E . ' s 71-year history . Cordiner did not radically change the product mix , which is spread almost equally among heavy electrical equipment , electronics , consumer goods and defense orders ( G.E . is the fifth biggest defense contractor ) . But he decentralized operations and management , making each of 112 department managers a minor president with responsibility for his own budget , pricing and policies . The managers answered to a lean headquarters staff in Manhattan , which was left free for more long-range planning . Cordiner ruthlessly removed managers who stumbled ( " It was not the best of times around G.E . at first , " recalls one G.E . executive ) , and decentralization was to blame for much of the company 's price-fixing mess . But it also streamlined G.E. , spurred on department managers and sent business soaring . From sales of $2.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . shot up to 1962 sales of $4.8 billion and earnings of $265.8 million . The figures for 1963 's first nine months have set a record . <P> <P> Scientific Sales . Despite this fine position , Fred Borch will still have some problems . Two large and significant departments-atomic power and the new line of lower-priced digital computers - are both still in the red . And with world competition rising fast , the world 's largest electrical equipment maker has some overcapacity . Taking up that slack will be the job of the marketing experts , who under the Cordiner revision won commanding power at G.E . The company 's $300 million annual expenditure on research is the largest of any U.S. corporation , but it is G.E . ' s marketing men rather than its researchers who have the final say on how products will be designed , produced and sold . <P>
