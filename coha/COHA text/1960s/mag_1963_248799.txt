" I am the Rolls-Royce of the fashion trade , " says Manhattan 's Mainbocher , and it is a simple statement of fact . At 72 , the short , round little man with the synthetic name can boast that his clothes are the most carefully made , the slowest to change , and among the most expensive in the world . If the upper-class look characterizes the lines of both Mainbocher and Balenciaga , " Main 's " clothes look like older money . <P> Mainbocher is also the great loner . He disregards the feverish pitch of the Paris houses and shows his collections at his own dignified pace ( his butler serves ice water instead of champagne ) . Last week two audiences-one of society women and one of fashion pros , both as carefully hand-picked as the members of a royal wedding-were admitted to the off-white salon on Fifth Avenue , sat reverently on couches and little blue chairs to watch six mannequins parade in 150 designs while the aging master explained them in a well-modulated whisper . <P> The news was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buttons all over . But sweeping innovations and fancy pace-setting are never the point . A Mainbocher is a Mainbocher , and the woman who wears it expects to go on wearing it for years . Which is almost necessary at those prices-the average price of a mere suit is $1,000 . <P> Mainbocher is the master of the throwaway : a little tweed jacket that suddenly turns out to be lined with sable , a simple something buttoned up to the neck that unbuttons-if you just happen to feel like it-to reveal a splash of Schlumberger or Verdura in emeralds and diamonds . He was making the sleeveless sheath long before Jackie Kennedy made it a clich . <P> The One &; Only . Mainbocher 's name is usually pronounced even by himself as if it were French ( Main-beau-chez ) , but he is as American as blue jeans . He was named Main Rousseau Bocher ( pronounced Bosher ) when he was born 72 years ago on the West Side of Chicago . His mother wanted him to be a painter , his father wanted him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singer . He had to change his plans when , just as he was about to go onstage for his debut in Paris , he lost his voice . <P> Unable to sing a note for three years , he became editor of the French edition of Vogue , and was so successful in the fashion world that in 1930 he opened his own salon . Mainbocher came to New York in 1939 , where he profited by the wartime blackout of France as the fashion center of the world . Today he is America 's sole exemplar of the big-name custom-only couturier . Unlike such top U.S. designers as Norman Norell and James Galanos , he does not distribute his models through department stores ; anyone who wants to buy a Mainbocher has to come to the Fifth Avenue salon . <P> The Appointment . And it is by no means as simple as that , either . Unless she comes with an introduction from an established client , the would-be customer is confronted by a formidable lady with a foreign accent who takes her name and informs her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a stall that gives the office staff a chance to check her social background and financial status . When she arrives for her appointed showing , there are seldom more than two other customers in the salon .
