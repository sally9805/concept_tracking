Even some Australians agree that Melbourne lies somewhere " behind the black stump " or , in current American , that it is a district of Squaresville . But Melbourne has its hipsters too , most notably a curvy , carrot-haired former choir singer named Diana Trask . Promoted from choir to nightclubs , Diana used to do Waltzing Matilda for visiting Americans . Discovered by Frank Sinatra and soon signed up by Columbia Records in New York , she has cut a series of briskly selling singles : Matilda , Long Ago Last Summer , Our Language of Love , I 'm So Lonesome I Could Cry . Now , with her first album , titled Diana Trask , she is beginning to strike the trade as pretty fair dinkum . <P> The voice is considerably more seasoned than the career . Although its owner is barely 20 , it has a comfortably upholstered sound and is used with discretion . To put new juice into jaded numbers , Songstress Trask has a habit of singing tantalizingly off pitch for a number of bars , or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crack of her high-heeled foot , breaking and reshaping the beat . The image goes with the voice : in her nightclub appearances she frequently appears in a skintight , flesh-colored satin skirt and turquoise sweater with matching eyelids , and bumps and swivels her way through a repertory that is by turns sexy , solicitous , folksy and dramatic . There is not a mingy number in the lot . <P> Other pop records : <P> Circulate ( Neil Sedaka ; RCA Victor ) . A first album by one of the more promising talents to emerge from the pop thickets in recent years . Singer Sedaka mercifully prefers his songs ungimmicked. and he gives a fine , fresh gloss to numbers such as All the Way , We Kiss in a Shadow , Everything Happens to Me . A songwriter as well as performer , Sedaka contributes a ballad with a better-than-average literacy count : I Found My World in You . <P> Wonderland by Night ( Bert Kaempfert and his Orchestra ; Dacca ) . An import from Germany that rocks on its mistily melodic way like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vintage Prom Trotter ' 35 . <P> Tour de Chant ( Michel Louvain ; Coral ) . A French-Canadian singer with a voice full of sighs , swoops and quavers his way through a pleasantly relaxed nightclub turn . Most of the songs will be new to U.S. listeners , but every so often Louvain slips in an oldie , e.g. , C'est le Print emps ( It Might as Well Be Spring or Viens Plus Pres ( Mama , Teach Me to Dance ) . <P> Will You Love Me Tomorrow ( The Shirelles ; Scepter ) . A nighttime lament by a new female quartet that throbs its sentiments with rough tenderness . That " love light in your eyes ' " may not survive the dawn , but it has booted the Shirelles to the top of the pop charts . <P> Exodus ( Hollywood Studio Orchestra ; United Artists ) . The most successful film score since . Bridge on the River Kwai , rendered in apocalyptic sound . Viennese-born Composer Ernest Gold , a veteran of two decades of film scoring ( On the Beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his colleagues how to write a mystery in a web of strings and nostalgia in a flute 's falling sigh . The film 's haunting theme hints of a talent for better things .
