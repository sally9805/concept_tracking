Not in the 30 years that the Gallup poll has been canvassing voters in Britain has there been such a drastic swing in public preference for a political party . Three months ago , Harold Wilson 's Labor government had been riding high with an 18% lead over the Conservatives . By last week Wilson 's party had not only lost its handsome lead but had actually slipped behind the Tories . <P> What bothered Britons was Wilson 's drastic program to rescue the pound : the six-month freeze on wages , prices and dividends , to be followed by another six months of " restraint . " His plan angered almost everyone , from 23,000 doctors on Britain 's health plan , who were required to forgo a 15% salary increase , to the 25,000-member civil service union , whose newspaper called Wilson 's measures " a monstrous breach of faith . " The powerful Trades Union Congress reluctantly agreed to continue to support Wilson 's wage policy , but discontent is so great within its member unions that the T.U.C. endorsement may be overturned at next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tactics brought bitter resentment in Parliament . As a maneuver to speed the passage of a wage-price freeze , Wilson attached the measure as a rider to an earlier bill that had already been debated in Commons . The effect was to bar debate there on the substance of Wilson 's measure-which of course brought an angry outcry from the opposition Tories . Conservative Leader Ted Heath rose in the House to remind Wilson that , during last year 's election campaign , the Prime Minister himself had described a wage freeze as " monstrously unfair " and " repugnant to all parties in this country . " When the debate issue was put to a vote , Wilson won-though with a sharply reduced majority . Dozens of Laborites clearly shared Heath 's view that so important a measure should be fully debated in the House . At least two dozen of Wilson 's followers abstained , in protest against the steamroller tactics . <P> As the politicians argued , the British Treasury released figures showing that the country 's reserves declined in July by only $70 million ( to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disbelief . In fact , most British financiers suspected that Britain had drawn as much as $420 million to $560 million from its emergency account with the Federal Reserve to cover up the true magnitude of July 's loss . <P> For all his tough measures , Wilson has not succeeded in restoring sterling to a strong , buoyant position . As a result , the talk in Britain among politicians and economists has turned increasingly toward devaluation of the pound as the only option left to Wilson if sterling comes under another severe attack .
