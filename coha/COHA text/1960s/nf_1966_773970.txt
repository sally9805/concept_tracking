txt // Principles of Motion Economy Through the pioneer work of Gilbreth and other investigators , certain rules for motion economy and efficiency have been developed . Some of the most important of these principles are the following : 1 . The movements of the two hands should be balanced and the two hands should begin and end their motions simultaneously . 2 . The hands should be doing productive work and should not be idle at the same time except during rest periods . 3 . Motions of the hands should be made in opposite and symmetrical directions and at the same time . 4 . The work should be arranged to permit it to be performed with an easy and natural rhythm . 5 . Momentum and ballistic-type movements should be employed wherever possible in order to reduce muscular effort . 6 . There should be a definite location for all tools and materials , and they should be located in front of and close to the worker . 7 . Bins or other devices should be used to deliver the materials close to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to insure adequate illumination , proper workplace height , and provision for alternate standing and sitting by the operator . 9 . Wherever possible , jigs , fixtures , or other mechanical devices should be used to relieve the hands of unnecessary work . 10 . Tools should be pre-positioned wherever possible in order to facilitate grasping them . Through the application of these principles , it is possible greatly to increase the output of manual labor with a minimum of fatigue . Work Simplification Programs In recent years , it has become common practice to conduct work simplification or methods improvement programs in industry . These programs usually have as their objective the reduction of manufacturing costs throut'h the participation of many persons . For example , in a work simplification program conducted by a large electrical manufacturing company , anticipated annual savings contributed by some 3000 supervisors was estimated to approach $7,500,000 . The concept of work simplification was introduced by Allen II . Mogenseft in the I930 's and eniphasiied worker participation as a means of achieving // maximum cost reduction . In the widespread adoption of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has been recognition of the need to acquaint many people with the aims and objectives of methods improvement programs . This orientation should take place at all levels , not only to bring about greater acceptance of methods improvement programs , but also to provide the knowledge of good methods design to all persons who may benefit from such information . Thus , it has been found profitable to present the programs to members of management ( including the president of the company ) , product engineers , process engineers , tool engineers , foremen , group leaders , and key operators . Frequently , the company suggestion system may be incorporated as part of the work sim plification program . It is customary for the methods engineers to conduct a training program as a basis for implementing the work simplification programs . These pro-grams may be given in one continuous session , but more often are limited to a series of two- or three-hour sessions held once or twice each week . In one large company , the course consists of twenty hours and covers the following topics : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charts . Multiple-activity charts . Principles of motion economy . Usually , the participants in the program are asked to apply the principles that they have learned to one or more operations being performed in their respective departments . Through the discussion of these problems , they are able to appreciate the benefits to be derived from a methods improvement program . Also , these people , being closer to their jobs than the methods engineers , can often suggest methods improvements that would escape the trained methods engineer . Most of the principles that are applied in methods improvement pro-grams have the tendency to reduce the content of a job method . Though this is done to reduce the skills required to do the job , it may result in jobs that are boring and monotonous and lead to little worker satisfaction . Some people are of the opinion that perhaps the industrial engineer has gone too far in reducing the job to its simplest components , and that it has been a serious mistake to have a worker performing a job requiring so little human potential . They10 suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor effectiveness can be increased and unit cost reduced by having the operator assume greater responsibility for the work he does , especially the quality of his work , and that he should have closer identity with the product he turns out . There is evidence to show that job enlargement may be both desirable and profitable in some cases , and some general rules pertaining to work design " appear to be developing that will aid in sound work methods design . Value Analysis An activity that is closely related to both methods improvement programs and to purchasing and that is being used increasingly in industry and the government is value analysis . " Value analysis is an objective study of every item of cost in every component part , subassembly , or piece of equipment . This includes a study of the design , the material and the process in a con-tinual search for other possible materials and new processes . " 12 Value analysis involves the evaluation of an item 's function and relates its effect on the end product . The purpose of it is to attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the function of the item . Just as in the work simplification approach , value analysis uses a ques-tioning attitude and asks some key questions : What is it ? What does it do ? What does it cost ? What is it worth ? What else will do the job ? How much will it cost ? It is obvious from the questions that value analysis is concerned with func-tion , cost , and value . It probably tends to put more emphasis on materials than the traditional methods analysis or work simplification programs . At the same time , it is an important ingredient of a total cost-reduction program . Suggestion Systems An important source of ideas for cost-saving improvements is the suggest ion system . The purpose of the suggestion system is to motivate the worker to // present any ideas he may have on ways in which the company can be operated better . As a reward for submitting his suggestion , it is common practice to pay the worker a percentage of the annual savings that will result . Some companies have found it difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , many companies have found them to be an invaluable source of cost-saving ideas and are happy to pay out large sums of money each year in order to encourage the continuance of this stream of potential savings . Social and Economic Effects of Methods Study As was pointed out at the beginning of this chapter , modern industry is constantly searching for better methods . When a business ceases to move forward it will lose ground and may eventually fail . It is for this reason that the major companies have organized industrial engineering departments , work simplification and value analysis programs , suggestion systems , and other methods of achieving reduced costs of manufacturing their products . One of the consequences of these programs has been increased mechani-sation , which , in turn , has led to the production of more and more goods per man-hour . Among the long-range benefits derived from this increased output have been : higher real wages , an improved standard of living , a shorter work week , and a reduction of the physical rigors of the job . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these may have a marked effect on the worker and are probably uppermost in his mind . It is obvious that in order to have methods improvement , there must be continuous changes in the status quo . This will invariably lead to worker resistance because it is normal to resist change . And if a worker is " laid off " as a result of methods changes , he , and perhaps his fellow workers , probably will be bitter about the change . In order to avoid this situation some com-panies have adopted the policy that no employee will be " laid off " as a result of methods changes . // 5 . How do you account for the fact that only a small percentage of companies use suggestion plans ? 6 . In seeking an improvement , what are some of the questions you might ask about each of the therbligs required in the operation of removing your pen from your pocket and writing your name on a sheet of paper ? 7 .

Is it possible for a company to be using good methods even though it does not have a methods improvement program ? 10 .

CASE PROBLEMS Jacobson Foundry One of the high production operations in the Jacobson Foundry consists of removing sand cores ( 8 " x 16 " x 1 " ) from drier plates ( plates on which cores are stacked while in the drier ) and then placing them in wood storage boxes ( 18 " x 18 " x 10 " deep ) , for moving to the molding department .

Illinois Machine Company The Illinois Machine Company manufactures tremendous quantities of automatic screw machine parts for use in its line of handcraft tools .

CHAPTER EIGHT Work Measurement Work measurement ( commonly referred to as " time study " ) is concerned with the determination of the amount of time required to perform a unit of work . For many years , its principal use was for wage-incentive purposes ; however , present-day industry finds many uses for work measurement , and it has become one of management 's most important tools . Increasingly , it has been used to measure indirect labor ( e.g. , maintenance workers and materials handlers ) and office work . Work measurement is used to determine the amount of time required by a qualified worker , using a standard method and working at a standard work pace , to perform a specified task . The time required for this task is commonly referred to as the " standard " or " allowed " time . Origin of Work Measurement Frederick W. Taylor is credited with having introduced work measurement or time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Midvale Steel Company in 1881 . While serving with Midvale as a gang boss and foreman , Taylor was confronted by questions such as : " What is the best way to do the job ? " " What equipment should be used ? " " What is a fair day 's work ? " In attempting to answer these questions , he studied each of various jobs for the purpose of finding the best method . He taught the worker how to use the new method , maintained the working conditions so the worker could do the job properly , established a time standard for accomplishing the work , and then paid the worker a premium for doing the work in the prescribed time and manner . " With Taylor , as with the factory manager 136 // today , work measurement was a tool to be used in increasing the overall efficiency of the plant , making possible higher wages for labor , and lower prices of the finished products to the consumer . " ' Uses of Work Measurement Data Analysis of the many manufacturing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclose most of them to depend upon time . Without using some unit of time it would be virtually impossible to plan and schedule production , to make cost estimates on new work , to balance production lines , or to control labor costs . If standard or allowed times are to be used , they should , for greatest accuracy , be obtained by a formal system of work measurement . The standard or allowed time values are usually determined for each of the operations required in the manufacture of a product and are com-monly expressed in hours per piece or per 100 pieces . Standard times may be used for any of the following purposes : The balancing of production lines for new models or new products . The balancing of crew activities on those jobs requiring several workers . Planning and scheduling the flow of production through the plant . Making cost estimates on new products or new models . Providing a basis for cost determination . Providing a basis for wage-incentive plans . Establishing supervisory objectives and providing a basis for meas-uring supervisory efficiency . It should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often justified for other than wage-incentive purposes . Work Measurement Equipment Following its introduction by Taylor , for many years , the most common way of determining time standards was through the use of the stop watch . Although used less frequently today , it still is in common use for measuring certain jobs . Figure 8-1 shows a decimal minute stop watch of the type used extensively in industry . This watch has a sweep hand that makes one rev-olution per minute ; therefore , each division on the large dial represents one one-hundredth of a minute . // Other timing devices that have been used to a lesser degree in industry are the motion-picture camera , the time-recording machine , and the Servis recorder . When the motion-picture camera is used , it is most frequently driven by a synchronous motor drive at a speed of 1000 , 100 , or 60 frames per minute ( see Figure 7-6 ) . This permits the measurement of time in either thousandths or hundredths of a minute or in seconds . The time-recording machine ( see Figure 8-2 ) , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small cabinet through which paper is drawn at a constant rate of speed . The tape has a printed scale in tenths of an inch , each division representing one one-hundredth of a minute . The machine has two keys , similar to those on a typewriter , and when these keys are depressed , marks are printed on the paper . By depressing one key at the end of each element and the other key at the end of the cycle , the time lapse for each element and for the cycle may be obtained . A number of automatic recorders have been developed that may be attached to a machine to record working time or idle time . There are various ways of activating these recorders . They may be started by a control on a machine , by means of the vibration of a machine , or by other means . Work Measurement by Stop Watch The steps usually performed in the making of a stop-watch time study are as follows : 1 . Securing permission from the supervisor for making the study and explaining to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job method for improvements , standardizing the job method , and recording on the observation sheet complete information about the job and operator . 3 . Breaking the job down into elements and recording these elements i n detail on the observation sheet . 4 . Determining and recording the times for each of the elements . 5 . Rating or leveling the operator 's performance . 6 . Providing allowances for personal time , fatigue , machine delays , and so forth . 7 . Calculating the standard or allowed time . Standardizing the Job Method It is important that the work measurement analyst give consideration to the present job method prior to determining the time . Oftentimes , the methods being used are poor , and obvious improvements are in order . Whenever possible the job methods should be altered prior to the taking of the time study in order to insure that the analyst 's efforts are not being wasted on a job that may soon undergo change . The importance of standardized job conditions should not be underestimated , since any variation in job conditions or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perform the task . For this reason , it is difficult to set accurate time standards on those jobs that are undergoing frequent change , involve large fluctuations in materials , or contain other // Where there is a choice of operators of whose performance the study may be made , it is common practice to choose one who is neither the very best nor the poorest . Before approaching the operator , the analyst should secure the supervisor 's permission and , where applicable , clear with the union . The supervisor should inform the operator in advance that a work measurement study is to be made , explaining the purpose of the study . At // no time should the study be made without the operator 's knowledge ? and never in secret . The information on the observation sheet should be accurately recorded . It is important that all information that may be used to identify the opera-tion and describe the conditions prevalent at the time of the study be put down carefully . Also , it is essential that a dimensioned sketch of the work-place showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or attached to the observation sheet . Recording the Job Method When an operation is being timed , the job should be broken down into separable parts and each of the parts timed . These parts are called elements // and contain a series of motions that can be identified , described , and recorded . ( As an illustration , elements are listed on the observation sheet shown in Figure 8-3 . ) In separating an operation into elements , it is recommended that ( 1 ) the elements be as short as can be conveniently timed , ( 2 ) man-time be separated from machine-time , ( 3 ) constant elements be separated from variable elements , and ( 4 ) the elements have clear-cut beginning and end points . Each element should be recorded in sufficient detail so that the job method is completely described and could be duplicated in identical fashion at a later date . Determining the Time After the operation has been divided into elements the next step is to determine the time for each element . The two most commonly used methods of timing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snapback or repetitive . In continuous timing , the analyst starts the watch at the beginning of the first element and allows it to run for the duration of the study . At the end of each element , he observes the watch reading and records it in the proper place on the observation sheet . At the conclusion of the study , the time for each element is determined by subtracting the time for the beginning of the element from the time at the end . In snapback or repetitive timing , the watch is started at the beginning of each element ; at the end of the element , the watch is read , the watch is snapped back to zero , and the time is recorded on the observation sheet . This process is repeated for each element for as many cycles as desired in the study . Each of the methods described above has obvious advantages over the other and in the hands of experienced work measurement analysts probably results in about the same degree of accuracy . However , the continuous method is generally considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eliminates the possibility of leaving out delays , and eliminates the necessity for snapping the watch back to zero . The observation sheet shown in Figure 8-3 illustrates the use of the continuous method . The time required to perform a job may be expected to vary slightly from cycle to cycle . Even if the operator works at a constant pace , some variation may be anticipated because of such things as the difference in exact position of materials or tools , difference in exact locations in which parts are disposed of , and variations in watch readings . Since work measurement is a sampling process , the analyst must insure that he times a sufficient number of cycles to give an adequate sample from the statistical population or universe from which the values have been drawn . It follows that the greater the number of cycles timed , the more nearly the results // will be representative of the activity being measured . The greater the inconsistency of the time values for an element , the larger the number of observations that will have to be taken to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the number of observations required to provide the desired level of accuracy , Mundell suggests the use of formulas such as the following : In addition to the formulas given above , Mundel and others have prepared tables and nomograms that may be used to determine the number of observations required to give the desired level of accuracy . After securing the time values , the representative time for each element must be calculated . Most organizations use the arithmetic average , but some prefer to use the modal or most frequently occurring time . This representative time is then multiplied by a rating or leveling factor to get the normal time . Rating the Operator 's Performance In order to adjust the operator 's performance to that of the normal or standard operator , most organizations rate or level each element of the time study . The Society for the Advancement of Management Committee on Rating of Time Studies has defined rating as follows : Rating is that process during which the time study man compares the performance of the operator under observation with the observer 's own concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been devised in industry . Some organizations rate pace or tempo of movement only ; others take into account skill and effort . No matter what system is used , the judgment of the work measurement analyst is required , and this allows room for possible error . The magnitude of this error , however , is surprisingly small for well-qualified analysts . The majority of work measurement analysts rate each element of a time study , although many prefer to rate the overall study . The rating factor is most frequently expressed as a percentage of normal performance ( normal performance = 100 per cent ) , and normal time for each element may be calculated as follows : The normal time is not the time allowed for the job , because it must be increased by any additional time allowed for interruptions , the operator 's personal needs , and delays beyond his control . Determining Allowances The normal time for an operation represents the amount of time the average operator would require when working at the normal pace and disregarding any additional time for personal needs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an operator can not be expected to maintain this pace throughout the workday , and additional time in the form of allowances is usually provided to cover such items as personal needs , rest for overcoming fatigue , machine delays , materials delays , or other unavoidable delays . The allowance for personal needs varies from about 2 per cent to 5 per cent for light work . For more rigorous work this allowance may be increased to as much as 50 per cent . Inasmuch as modern industry has taken many steps to eliminate the causes of fatigue , and " fatigue " is a vague phenomenon that is difficult to measure , many companies do not make an allowance for it . Other companies have worked out satisfactory figures by trial and error . In many cases these figures are based upon the total weight lifted or moved by the worker and may amount to as much as 30 per cent or more . Special allowances for machine delays , materials delays , materials variations , and similar events beyond the control of the operator , are usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ratiodelay or work sampling study is a particularly useful method of determining these allowances and will be discussed later . This method , which is a statistical sampling technique utilizing a large number of random observations by // an analyst , may be used to determine the percentage of time a machine is clown and the reasons why it is n't operating . The standard or allowed time is determined by increasing the normal time by the total amount of the allowance as follows : Standard time = Normal time x ( 100 + allowance in per cent ) 100 Work Sampling 1 n 1934 L. H. C. Tippett ' described a statistical approach that he had used in the English textile industry to measure operator and machine delays . He found this method to be quite effective for determining the cause of loom stoppages in the factories he was studying . R. L. Morrow5 , who was one of the first persons in this country to use Tippett 's method , called it " ratio-delay . " The ratio-delay method began to find gradual use in American industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featured in an article by C. L. Brisley6 in Factory Magazine and renamed " work sampling . " Since 1952 work sampling has gained widespread usage in the following ways : To measure the working and non-working time of men and of machines to use in estimating delay allowances . To estimate the per cent of utilization time of machines and equip ment , such as machine tools , fork-lift trucks , elevators , overhead cranes , and so forth . To estimate the per cent of time devoted to each of the duties included in the jobs performed by such people as maintenance personnel , office workers , managers , and nurses . To measure a task for the purpose of establishing a time standard on it . Work sampling has become a popular tool for use in areas such as those listed because it is easy and convenient to use , possesses known reliability that can be established at the outset , and operates without the use of the stop watch or other timing devices . Work samplingas the name impliesis a sampling technique based // upon the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the occurrences in an adequate , random sample of observations of an activity will follow the same distribution pattern that might be found in a lengthy , continuous study of the same activity . This may be represented by the following proportion : *It should be noted that the 50 observations used in this example is a much smaller number than normally would be required and in actual practice hundreds of observations may be necessary . It follows then that ( based upon the observations ) the operator was working 40/50 of the total or 80 per cent of the time and was idle 10/50 of the total or 20 per cent of the time . The simple approach given in the example just cited illustrates the manner in which work sampling may be used . The key to the accuracy of the technique is in the number of observations . A greater number of observations provides a higher degree of accuracy . The question of how many observations are necessary to insure a certain level of accuracy may be calculated through the use of standard formulas based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent and an accuracy of ? 5 per cent are satisfactory , the number of observations required may be obtained by the following formula : $ Thus , the work sampling method consists of taking a number of intermittent , randomly spaced , instantaneous observations of the activity being studied and from this determining the per cent of time devoted to each aspect of the operation . To illustrate the manner in which this may be done , let us consider a man operating a fork-lift truck . By means of 50 instantaneous observations taken at randomly spaced times , the operator was observed and tally marks were noted to indicate whether be was working or idle ( definitions have to be predetermined to establish what constitutes " working " ) , as indicated below : // At the time the study is initiated , it is common practice to estimate p in order to get an estimate of N. Then as the study progresses , the values of p can be calculated and N redetermined . The procedure for making a work sampling study consists of essentially the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including definitions of the states of activity to be observed . 2 . Plan the sampling procedure , including : An estimate of the percentage of time being devoted to each phase of the activity . The setting of the accuracy limits desired . An estimation of the number of observations required . The selection of the length of the study period and the program ming of the number of readings over this period . The establishment of the mechanics of making the observations , the route to follow , and the recording of data . 3 . Collect the data as planned . 4 . Process the data and present the results . As indicated earlier , work sampling has a number of advantages over conventional work measurement methods . Among these are the following : It is economical to use and usually costs considerably less than a continuous time study . It can be used to measure many activities that are impractical to measure by time study . It is n't necessary to use a trained work measurement analyst to make the observations . Work sampling measurements may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sampling measures the utilization of people and equipment directly . It eliminates the necessity of using the stop watch for measurements . It provides observation over a sufficiently long period of time to decrease the chance of day-to-day variations affecting the results . Even though work sampling is a valuable tool , it has limitations , namely : 1 . Normally , it is not economical for studying work at a single location // or where work is highly standardized and can be studied by conventional work measurement methods . 2 . It is of little value in helping to improve work methods and does n't offer some of the opportunity for methods analysis that accompanies time study methods . 3 . Management and the workers may not understand statistical work sampling . 4 . Some of the observers may not adhere to the fundamental principles of sampling and may bias the results . Elemental-Motion Time Systems Since the end of World War II there has been increasing usage of elemental-or basic-motion time systems for establishing time standards . These systems , which have been devised by several large companies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average time for a person to perform a basic motion or therblig should be relatively constant . Most of the systems ( " methods time measurement , " " work factor , " " basic motion times , " " method time analysis , " " basic time survey , " elemental time system , " and so on ) consist of tables of standard time values for performing various types of basic motions ? move , reach , position , and so forth . The time values may be applied to any type of operation that may be resolved to the basic motions , eliminating the necessity for using the stop watch . Figure 8-4 illustrates the time values used in one system . The procedure used in setting a time standard is to break the job method down into basic motions and then apply the appropriate time values for each motion . The sum of these time values becomes the standard time for the job . Additional time for allowances may have to be added in some cases depending upon the job being analyzed and the system being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following advantages for their use : 1 . Time standards may be set in advance of the performance of the job . 2 . It makes the analyst motion-conscious and facilitates obvious improvements in methods . 3 . Production lines may be balanced in advance . 4 . Cost estimates may be made in advance of making the product . 5 . The use of standard data is facilitated . 6 . It facilitates choosing between alternative methods . 7 . It facilitates training supervisors to be methods-conscious. // Standard Data Many organizations have adopted systems for synthesizing time standards from previously determined time values . These time values , which may be obtained from stop-watch time studies or from elemental-motion time systems , are accumulated in the form of times for elements that are common to many jobs and are frequently referred to as standard data . Through the use of these data , new time standards may be set on many kinds of jobs without the making of a time study . This makes it possible to set new standards in advance of performance of the operation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistently than by individual studies . In establishing standard data , the following steps are commonly taken : 1 . The range of items to be covered is determined . 2 . A trial breakdown of elements common to all items is established . 3 . Time studies are made of the entire range of items to be covered . 4 . A master list of elements is prepared and listed on a master summary sheet . 5 . The individual element times for each time study are posted on the master summary sheet . 6 . The constant elements are separated from the variable elements and the results are shown in the form of curves , nomograms , tables , or formulas . Administration of Work Measurement One of the major problems encountered in administering time standards is that of maintaining accurate standards . The work measurement department must provide a continuous check on the job method , materials , and tools to make sure there have been no changes that will affect the time values . This can be accomplished only by continuous review of job methods with complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of judgment enters into the setting of a time standard , many work measurement analysts are subjected to frequent training sessions on rating and other phases of the time study procedure . This helps maintain reasonable consistency among the persons involved and provides uniform time standards throughout the plant . Management has frequently been accused of " rate cutting " and " speedup " and must guard against gaining this reputation . Most companies guarantee that unless there is a change in the job method the time standard will remain in effect no matter how high the incentive earnings of the workers may he . Oftentimes , this allows a worker , on whose job there is a " loose " // standard , to work at a low pace and still get high incentive earnings . This presents a difficult problem and sometimes is solved only through collective bargaining . Criticisms of Work Measurement The individual worker 's reaction to work measurement is based largely upon how it affects him and his fellow workers . If he is working on a job where he can maintain a work pace that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is able to receive sizable incentive earnings , then he is probably in favor of work measurement . On the other hand , if he feels he is forced to " speed up " and has difficulty in keeping up or in making a bonus , then he will probably be opposed to it . At the same time , his attitude will be greatly influenced by the attitude expressed by his union leaders . As William Gomberg has so aptly stated , the attitude of unions toward time study will probably take one of the following forms : Complete rejection of time study techniques as a guide to the setting of a fair day 's work . Consideration of the rate proposed by the time study engineers as an offer . The union reserves the right to determine whether or not it will accept the offer by any criterion , time study or otherwise , that it sees fit . The joint acceptance of a time study system mutually satisfactory to union and management as a means of setting rates . The development of a system of standard data that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , a number of unions have attempted to provide a check on work measurement by establishing their own work measurement groups and by training their own analysts . In spite of the progress made by many companies in improving their work measurement practices , innumerable companies maintain inadequate staffs of qualified analysts and may be condemned for faulty practice .

Will the use of work measurement be eliminated in the factories of the future ? Why ? CASE PROBLEMS Keller Manufacturing Company The Keller Manufacturing Company is a small company employing about 150 persons in the manufacture of aluminum windows . The company has made extensive use of time study for its wage incentive plan , production scheduling , and cost estimating for the past 10 years . Last year Roger Bellows , a highly experienced time-study man , quit the company . This left the company without a trained time-study analyst . Mr. Davidson , the general manager , decided that the company could get along without replacing Roger Bellows and that Robert Musgrave , the timekeeper , could set time standards in addition to his other duties . Robert Musgrave is a personable and conscientious employee , and he endeavored to do a good job of setting accurate standards .

CHAPTER NINE Materials Handling In order to manufacture any product , it is necessary that materials either move from one step of the manufacturing process to another or that oper-ators move to the materials . The most common practice , of course , is to move the materials . This movement of materials from one processing area to another and from department to department necessitates the use of much manpower and the handling of tremendous tonnages of materials . It has been estimated ' that : items are being worked on only 20 per cent of the time and in storage or undergoing handling 80 per cent of the time ; 22 per cent of industries ' manpower is used in handling materials ; and throughout industry , 50 tons of product must be handled to produce one ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been an important factor in man-ufacturing . But only recently has attention been focused on this problem with a view toward the improvement of equipment and methods and the reduction of manufacturing costs . There has been growing realization of the magnitude of the problem and recognition of the high ratio of materials handling costs to other costs of manufacturing . For example , one survey showed an average of 22 per cent of the cost of manufacture was for the handling of materials ; other estimates run as high as 60 per cent . This trend may increase as greater degrees of mechanization and automation appear in industry with the resultant decrease of the labor cost . it follows then that // materials handling presents one of the most potentially lucrative areas for the improvement of equipment and methods and the reduction of costs . Definition of Materials Handling In a broad sense materials handling includes all movement of materials in a manufacturing situation . It has been defined by the American Material Handling Society as follows : " Materials Handling is the art and science involving the movement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is an all-inclusive definition and can include fluids and semi-fluids , as well as discrete items . For the sake of simplicity , we shall limit our discussion in this chapter to the movement of discrete items , such as transistors , gears , tires , castings , and boxes . Likewise , we shall consider only the movement of materials within the plant or storage areas . Movement of materials between plants ? particularly when common carriers are used ? is generally considered a problem in traffic and is frequently handled by a separate traffic department . Based on the somewhat restricted concept that we have established for discussing the subject of materials handling , we shall be concerned only with the storage and movement of goods that have been received by the manufacturer . This will include the handling of materials through various storages and operations from the raw materials state to the final completion stage and shipment of the product . Much of our discussion will revolve around the use of equipment , but we shall also take into consideration man as a materials handler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is common practice by the worker at the machine or bench , parts are usually assembled into unit loads for transport between work stations . Unit load. refers to tote pans , boxes , pallets , or skids , which are designed to carry more than one part , package , or product at a time . Illustrations of unit loads are given in ? Figures 9-1 a , b , c . Much has been done in the mechanization and automation of materials handling . As the automatic factory of the future is developed , the time may come when the handling of materials will be so closely integrated with the manufacturing process that the handling and processing of the product will be identified as one activity . Objectives of Materials Handling The simplest solution to the materials handling problem ? " No movemennt , no cost " is hardly practicable for a complete manufacturing process . It is // a basically sound approach when one is attempting to improve a complete production cycle , and when the number of handlings can be reduced . It is also a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this latter situation it is often more feasible to bring the tools and workers to the product than to transport the product to the machine or work area . In addition to the objective of reducing the overall costs of materials handling by reducing the number of handlings involved , the following may be considered as objectives of the engineer in his approach to this problem : 1 . Lower the unit materials handling costs . It is obvious that the overall , or total , materials handling costs will be reduced if unit costs are reduced . This approach requires that costs of handling be allocated or identified to the units of product , or to its component parts that are moved . In many manufacturing situations this allocation is not too easy . For example , in a plant making many different products , a shop truck may be used to move a load that has 12 tote pans , each pan containing different numbers of different parts . The breakdown of this cost of movement to the cost for each part handled ( a unit handling cost ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detail into which materials // handling costs are to be analyzed . However , where feasible a unit-cost analysis may be very effective in determining which handlings involve excessive costs . Reduce the manufacturing-cycle time . The total time required to make a product from the receipt of raw materials to the finished goods can be reduced through effective materials handling . Movement of materials can be speeded up or may be handled over shorter distances . Successful reduction of the manufacturing-cycle time will reduce inventory costs and other production costs incident thereto . Contribute towards a better control of the flow of goods . A prin principal way in which good materials handling practice can effect savings is by making the control of goods easier ? particularly in continuous manufac turing , where all operations are " tied together " by the materials handling plan . In this situation the problem of production control is reduced to con trol at the starting point of the process and to the watching of the rate of flow at selected control points throughout the process . On many assembly lines the conveyor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved working conditions and greater safety in the movement of materials . Safe handling of materials will be reflected in a better industrial accident record . This is both a tangible saving in reduced insurance rates and an intangible saving in improved employee morale result ing from safer working conditions . Provide for fewer rejects . Care in the handling of the product will contribute to a better quality level of the goods produced . Products damaged by inefficient handling are all too often a major cost to manufac turers . Allow increased storage capacity . Better movement and storage of materials should increase the utilization of storage space . Gain higher productivity at lower manufacturing cost . Successful attainment of the above objectives contributes to this goal . Higher pro ductivity can be gained for both machines and workers through better handling of materials . As higher productivity is attained , the overhead costs should eventually decline , and as a result more and better goods will he produced at lower costs . // Principles of Materials Handling Attainment of the objectives of good materials handling practice can be facilitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as are listed : 1 . Eliminate wasteful methods by : Reducing to a minimum the number of handlings of materials . Eliminating unnecessary mixing and subsequent sorting . Using mechanical aids to eliminate the use of hand labor in movement of materials . Avoiding the unnecessary transfer of materials from floor to workplace or from container to container . Utilizing containers and unit loads . Utilizing gravity as a moving force wherever possible . Introducing automaticity into the materials handling plan . 2 . In laying out the plant : Combine handling with processing wherever possible . Provide for continuous or appropriate intermittent flow of materials . Provide for the shortest transportation of materials between operations and with a minimum of retrograde movement . Plan the layout of the work-station area for a minimum of handling of the product . Coordinate the overall materials handling throughout the entire plant . Plan for adequate receiving , storage , and shipping facilities . Design adequate aisle and access areas . 3 . In the selection and application of materials handling equipment : Analyze equipment needs before considering the purchase of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively . Use the simplest equipment that is adaptable to the problem ; avoid the use of complicated mechanisms and controls . Adopt standard equipment if possible ; insure that if used , special equipment is economically justified . Select equipment that is flexible in its application . Determine comparative costs of equipment before purchasing . Recognize the need for different equipment for different jobs . // ( h ) Recognize the need to provide suitable building conditions for the equipment . ( i ) Provide for alternative methods for use in emergencies . ( j ) Give consideration to the maintenance of the equipment . Some general principles that can also be applied in the materials handling area are : 1 . Use sound planning in the solving of materials handling problems . Keep the overall problem in mind , thoroughly analyze the problem and attempt to evaluate the results before taking final action . 2 . Insure proper communications with all individuals concerned when installing a new method or piece of equipment . Many a sound solution to a materials handling problem has failed owing to lack of understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 3 . Follow up the installation to insure its effectiveness and evaluate the results . 4 . Do not hesitate to take such corrective action as is necessary ? the best solution is not always attained on the first attempt . However , immediate corrective action may not be feasible in many instances , and the improvements may have to be tabled until another change in method or equipment can be justified economically . Under certain circumstances the approach to the materials handling problem may be reduced to a checklist . In such cases care should be exercised to insure that the checklist does not become a crutch on which the materials handling personnel lean exclusively . Checklists , although very useful , may tend to limit the ingenuity and the creativeness of individuals which are so essential to industrial progress . The ability to approach any problem with an abstract and totally uninhibited attitude is invaluable to the engineer in materials handling , as it is in any other field of activity . Analysis of Materials Handling Problems In the chapter on methods engineering , we discussed a systematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedure will work equally well in solving materials handling problems . It necessitates the establishment of an objective , collecting as much factual data as possible , analyzing the data , applying known principles , and formulating a solution . In collecting the data , careful attention should be given to the effects of handling on the product , the present method , and cost factors . Too often the materials handling engineer does a superficial job of analyzing the problem and thinks only , " What equipment can he purchased to do this job ' ? " A better approach would he to analyze the problem // thoroughly , formulate a solution , and only then give consideration to any equipment that may be required . An approach of this type led one company , a maker of collapsible wire containers , to discover that it could solve most of its materials handling problems by using its own product instead of purchasing outside equipment . General Types of Materials Handling Equipment A detailed discussion of the many types of materials handling equipment and of the capabilities and characteristics of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , are important to the engineer developing the materials handling plan for a manufacturing plant . Extensive informa-tion covering specifications of various equipment is available , particularly from the materials handling equipment manufacturers . There are so many different types of equipment developed or being developed for the handling of materials that classification may also be quite confusing . According to the Materials Handling Handbook , ' there are over 430 kinds of materials handling equipment divided into the following nine major categories : Conveyors . Cranes , elevators , and hoists . Positioning , weighing , and control equipment . Industrial vehicles . Motor vehicles . Railroad cars . Marine carriers . Aircraft . Containers and supports . The list contains a number of relatively specialized pieces of equipment that are not used within the typical manufacturing plant . Several of the more common items found in typical plants are illustrated in Figures 9-2 to 9-5 . In selecting equipment , considerable attention should be given to the flexibility of the equipment . The greater the degree of flexibility designed into a piece of materials handling equipment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application of the equipment into the manufacturing situa-tion. // // Current trend is to consider more and more the entire production process as a complete materials handling problem and to so plan the equipment that total overall efficiency is attained . This naturally leads to the development of transfer devices and feedback controls ? which in turn leads to automation . Factors Affecting the Selection of Materials Handling Equipment The selection of materials handling equipment requires the attaining of proper balance between the production problem , the capabilities of the equipment available , and the human element involved . The ultimate aim is to arrive at the lowest cost per unit of material handled . The production-problem factors that enter into this consideration are the volume of production to be attained ( in terms of the rate of production ) , // the class of materials to be handled , and the layout of the plant and building facilities . The equipment that can be economically justified for the manufacture of 1000 television sets a day would be entirely different from the equipment used in a plant manufacturing 20 steam turbine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate and the weight and class of the materials are different . Likewise , the equipment in a flour mill or food processing factory would present a quite different problem . It might well be assumed that in the designing of a new plant the layout and building facilities could be adapted to the best materials handling plan . However , in this most favorable situation some compromise may still have to be made owing to other factors , such as future plant expansion , flexibility of layout , or restrictions that may be placed on the type of building to be constructed . It is obvious that in the case of an existing plant the layout and building facilities affect the selection of materials handling equipment . Equipment factors to be taken into consideration may well include the following : Adaptability . The load-carrying and movement characteristics of the equipment should fit the materials handling problem . Flexibility . Where possible the equipment should have flexibility so that more than one material , either as to class or size , can he handled . Load capacity . Equipment selected should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job effectively , yet should not be too large and result in excessive operating costs . 4 . Power . Enough power should be available to do the job . 5 . Speed . Rapidity of movement of material , within the limits of the production process or plant safety , should be considered . 6 . Space requirements . The space required to install or operate materials handling equipment is an important factor in its selection . 7 . Supervision required . As applied to equipment selection this refers to the degree of automaticity designed into the equipment . 8 . Ease of maintenance . Equipment selected should be easily maintained at reasonable cost . 9 . Cost . The consideration of the cost of the equipment is an obvious factor in its selection . Figure 9-6 shows an equipment-selection chart applying many of the above factors to specific items of equipment . There are other equipment factors that may enter a problem in materials handling equipment selection . These too may be important , even as the relative importance of the above is not indicated by the order in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be overlooked in the selection of materials handling equipment . The consideration of materials handling might bring to mind the laborer who is " all brawn and few brains , " but modern materials handling equipment may in some instances require both intelligence and skill for its effective operation . Hence , the capabilities of the available manpower enter into the equipment selection . Safety of personnel is an important human factor . The equipment selected must result in safe working conditions . Finally , the equipment must be accepted by the workers . The eccentricities of labor in this respect must always be anticipated as closely as possible and steps taken to " sell " the new equipment to those who will operate or come into contact with it . Materials Handling Cost General cost-accounting practice classifies the cost of handling materials as an indirect cost or overhead . This classification is based on the position that the movement of the materials does not contribute to their physical change or add value to them as a product or as a component part thereof . In some manufacturing situations , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly moving during the production process , this contention of the cost accountants might be challenged . However , the problem of classification of unit handling costs in most situations is more of an academic than a practical problem . In many instances the clerical costs to deterMATERIALS // mine unit materials handling costs , either to apply them as a direct cost value or to use them as standard costs for the control of the operations , may exceed any savings that might be effected through such control or analysis . Furthermore , as discussed above , the determination of a unit handling cost is at times quite difficult . But as the rate of production or flow of material is increased , and the different types or kinds of part and product are reduced , it becomes much easier to determine and allocate materials handling unit costs accurately . When feasible , costs should be determined on a unit cost basis for the proper evaluation of the materials handling problem . Such analyses will indicate those costs that are excessive , thus pointing out those areas where improvement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In any case , the expense of accumulating and determining unit costs must be justified through the use of such costs as a continuing control and guide for the reduction of the expense of handling materials . It is evident that the current trend toward integrating materials handling with the actual operations required in the processing of the product will result in losing the identity of materials handling costs as such ? these costs being included in the direct labor or machine costs for the manufacture of the goods . Economics of Materials Handling Proper selection and use of materials handling equipment and methods is basically a problem in manufacturing economics . The ultimate objective is always the handling of goods at the optimum cost . This optimum cost must be evaluated on the total operation and may not be the lowest cost based upon a short-range computation . Both tangible and intangible values must be assessed and a balance of costs and savings arrived at that will prove most profitable to the enterprise in the long run . Basically the cost of the equipment , as reflected in depreciation charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the savings that can be effected through the use of the equipment and of the method that the equipment involves . Tangible savings may be realized ? or anticipated ? on one or more of the following three bases : 1 . Lower total costs for the handling of materials . 2 . Lower unit costs for the handling of the product or assembly being manufactured . 3 . Lower unit costs for the handling of component parts , subassemblies , and asscmblies. // These three bases call for a progressively greater breakdown of costs , the inherent problem being their determination . Generally speaking , the greater the degree to which costs are broken down , the more accurately they may be calculated . This is in itself a problem of economics ; the value of such cost accuracy must be balanced against the expense involved in acquiring this accuracy . Intangible savings that can be made through effective handling of materials are many . Some are : 1 . Better control of production . 2 . Better quality level of products produced . 3 . Greater safety to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intangible savings may be realized . However , if a true economic picture of the materials handling problem is to be had , it becomes necessary to assign values to these savings . Determination of such values is one of the principal steps in the operations-research approach to this type of manufacturing problem . The economic effect of the proper analysis and determination of unit loads should not be overlooked . Careful study of this phase of the materials handling problem ? as well as that of packaging ? will pay dividends in the form of reduced handling costs . From this discussion it should not be assumed that mechanization and the elimination of hand labor will always result in the lowest cost . In many instances it may be found that the cost of equipment , and its operation , will more than offset any savings . In other words , manpower may still be the best when all factors are considered . Another case is where a visual inspection of the product is required ; if the product has to be picked up and inspected , it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or between other materials handling means ) is needed . The inspector can include such transfer as a part of his inspection operation . Relation of Materials Handling to Flow of Material and Plant Layout The pattern of flow of materials in a plant definitely affects the materials handling costs . The production process should be so planned and the machines and benches so arranged that the handlings of materials are reduced to a minimum with as little backtracking of goods as possible . The type of manufacturing is a major factor in this respect . In the layout of a plant for continuous manufacture the pattern of flow is planned well in advance ; because of balanced machine and assembly // lines , it lends itself to a well-planned flow of component parts , subassemblies , and assemblies . This makes it possible to plan the handling of materials in advance , procure and install the best equipment for the job , and design for a minimum materials handling cost . However , once installed the plan lacks flexibility ? usually it can not be changed without major expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be much more flexible . Backtracking of materials should be minimized , but the nature of this type of layout makes this a more difficult problem to solve . Equipment selected will in most cases be more general purpose in nature , and as a result it may be changed for improved materials handling methods without incurring major expense . The use of flow process charts is most helpful in planning processes and identifying the materials handling elements . This technique of methods analysis can be used not only as a designing tool but also for critical analysis of existing movements and handlings of materials . Instructional literature and forms are prepared by equipment manufacturers to assist their prospective customers in analyzing their materials handling problems . In the same manner that good flow of materials should be planned for the plant layout as a whole , the layout of each work station ? each machine location or workbench ? should be carefully planned to insure the minimum of handling of materials by the most effective means . As has been previously pointed out this activity is really a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment to be used . Processing and materials handling must be closely coordinated for best results . Another important materials handling factor in plant layout is the space required by the equipment to be used for moving goods . Factory trucks require certain turning radii , floor and overhead conveyors require space for installation , and cranes and hoists must be carefully laid out in the factory plan for maximum utilization . All this presents to the engineer a problem in compromising between building availability and the space requirements of the materials handling equipment to be used . It is seldom that the materials handling equipment can be planned first and the building planned around the equipment . Of course , the possible modification of building structure or layout must be considered when contemplating a change for the improvement of materials handling methods by the adoption of new equipment . On assembly lines that involve manual labor the length of the line to be planned depends on attaining a proper balance between the work to be done by each assembler and the speed at which the line is to be operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line must be planned ; the sum total of these stations affects both the floor space required and the design of the conveyor . It is obvious that with the current trend towards automation the entire // problem of space requirements for materials handling equipment will be gradually integrated with the processing-space requirements . As a matter of fact such integration exists today in large automobile factories and in plants producing large volumes of household appliances . Storage Material in storage is generally thought to be stationary or idle . But the use of conveyors as storage devices is becoming quite popular . These conveyors may be overhead and constantly moving , yet utilizing ceiling-space storage . Such an installation is pictured in Figure 9-7 . Other storage installations may be like the skate conveyors shown in Figure 9-8 . Tn one midwestern furniture plant the complete floor of the finish drying room is covered by a large slat conveyor that moves very slowly ; pieces placed on this " floor " at one side of the room are dry when they reach the other side . Storage facilities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the product . Permanent racks and bins may be eliminated in a warehouse if goods are palletized in such a manner that the pallets can be stacked , or if the product is so packaged that the package can be used as 173 174 // a stacking unit ( see Figure 9-9 ) . Stackable tote boxes and bins also make the utilization of storage space quite flexible . Increasing interest in the automation of storage warehouses is taking place ( see Figures 9-8a , b , c , d ) . One such warehouse " constructed in the midwest handles cartons of toilet articles in a broad range of sizes and varieties . It can fill up to 800 average orders per day in a normal 8-hour shift . Up to 90 different items can be picked automatically from special racks and merged with previously hand-picked , low-demand items at speeds up // to 400 fpm . An order assembled in this manner can be routed automatically to any of five truck dock feeder lines in less than a minute . The five feeder lines can receive and/or accumulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage problems can be jointly solved to the mutual advantage of both . Likewise , the common solution directly affects the layout of the plant facilities , or is itself influenced by the existing floor plan and building construction . Packaging Whether packaging is or is not a phase of materials handling is to some degree an academic question . The unit load is in itself a " package . " Generally speaking , however , the term packaging is used to cover the preparation of the final product for shipment , particularly if the product is a consumer good . From the viewpoint of a materials handling problem , packaging of the incoming materials as well as of the outgoing product directly affects materials handling methods and equipment ? and the resultant materials handling costs . The designing of the package for a product , although usually identified as a separate activity or function , is closely interrelated with materials handling , methods of production , and marketing . Attractively packaged goods on the shelves and counters of the store , as well as the identification of large shipments on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotion . The package of today is a far cry from the crate and box used for shipment 10 or 15 years ago . Lumber may now be shipped in palletized loads instead of being piled in a boxcar so that each individual board must be handled when unloading . Furniture , which used to be carefully enclosed in wooden crates ? the cost of which often equaled the value of the product being crated ? is now boxed in fiberboard cartons . Delicate precision instruments that formerly required cushioned containers are now suspended in plastic envelopes in rigid boxes . These are just a few examples of the fairly recent improvements in the field of packaging . Modern packages are also designed for efficient storage , not only from the standpoint of rigidity for stacking , but also for effective protection of the product from deterioration . The use of plastics , particularly in the packaging of foods , has contributed to the latter objective of sound packaging . Mechanization has had important influence on the field of packaging . This is particularly true in the food processing industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling and packaging of the product without the use of the human hand . Looking into the future , // a large manufacturer of electric refrigerators is now packaging the complete unit in a large fiberboard container on a completely automatic machine . In this case it is particularly interesting to note that the first step in this development was the redesign of the package . This first step was put into effect in the shipping room in advance of the availability of the special machine ; and with the use of manual labor it still resulted in outstanding savings . Thus , the package in which the material is handled , is an important part of the total materials handling problem in a manufacturing situation . Organization for Effective Materials Handling Good materials handling practice is the responsibility of all members of the manufacturing team , from the top management down to the trucker working in the aisle of the plant . Very few other elements of manufacturing activity must be so carefully considered by each function in the manufacturing organization . Optimum effectiveness of materials handling procedures can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Education and training in materials handling are prerequisite to minimum materials handling costs . Although the responsibilities and duties involved in materials handling must of necessity become a part of each individual 's job , the coordination of the total materials handling problem can be assigned to one individual or group . Large manufacturing organizations can well afford to organize specialists in materials handling into one of the staff or advisory groups reporting to the manager of manufacturing . Responsibilities assigned such a staff group may well include : 1 . Determine all new methods for the handling of new materials or products and select the equipment to be utilized . 2 . Conduct research in materials handling methods and equipment . 3 . Conduct education and training for all manufacturing personnel in good materials handling practices . 4 . Establish controls of current materials handling costs by analysis of costs and comparison to budgets of either unit or total materials handling costs . 5 . Initiate and conduct a continuing materials handling cost-reduction or cost-improvement program . 6 . Determine measurements for effectiveness of materials handling that can become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Develop and conduct a preventive maintenance program for all materials handling equipment . // Each of the above activities will contribute to lower materials handling costs . In smaller plants these responsibilities must be assumed as part-time jobs by members of the manufacturing line organization . However , maximum effectiveness might be attained by assigning the principal coordinating responsibility for all materials handling activities to one individual or to a committee of several from the manufacturing group .

The large steel-strapped bales of denim are hauled from the end of the production line to the finished goods warehouse by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bales they are usually placed on the floor or , at best , stacked two high . This has resulted in little usage of the cubage in the warehouse and excessive warehousing costs .

The high-speed machines used by Acme enable it to meet its production demands , but have created a materials handling problem . This problem arises from the necessity to handle , move , and store the tremendous daily output of a battery of screw cap machines . Some of the machines turn out as many as 100,000 screw cap shells per hour . These must be moved either to a final manufacturing operation on a lower floor or to a storage area for future use . James Elrod , the materials handling engineer , worked on the above problem for several weeks and has recommended that special box-type ( 30 " x 48 " x 36 " ) trucks be purchased These trucks come equipped with casters and can be easily moved by hand . A special feature of these trucks is a hinged door , which opens when the box is tilted forward . This would allow the caps to slide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where final manufacturing is completed .

In considering solutions to problems such as this , from where would you secure information ? CHAPTER TEN Plant Layout Plant layout is a plan of the most effective arrangement of the physical facilities and manpower for the manufacture of the product . It brings together and fully integrates all the work that has been done by the architect , the product engineer , the process engineer , the plant engineer , and the management in their careful planning for the production of goods in an optimum manner . Plant layout encompasses much more than the mere planning of the arrangement of the production equipment and should include a careful study ' of the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspection , stores ) . Production activities . Service and auxiliary operations . Quality control and inspection areas . Packaging operations . Storage . operations . Shipping operations . Plant layout is a valuable tool of management not only for the building of new plants but also in planning for changes in existing facilities . New products , new processes , or an increase or decrease in rates of production may require a rearrangement of production equipment . Of greatest impor-tance is the adaptability of the plant layout to the forward planning of the company . The maintenance of the layout of a plant for historical purposes only is of little real value . // We must not confuse plant layout with the design of industrial buildings . Obviously the two problems are closely related and in reality often require a compromise between the best design in each area . Seldom can a building be constructed around an " ideal " plant layout , and many times a layout must be changed to meet the requirements of the building . Plant layout covers the planning of space requirements for all activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms , and all other facilities associated with the total manufacturing plant . Objectives of Plant Layout The primary goal of plant layout is to maximize profits by the arrangement of all plant facilities to the best advantage of the total " manufacturing equation " ? men , materials , machines , and money . If a finished layout is to fulfill this goal , it should be planned with the following objectives2 clearly in mind : Facilitate the manufacturing process . Minimize materials handling . Maintain flexibility of arrangement and of operation . Maintain high turnover of work-in-process . Hold down investment in equipment . Make economical use of floor area . Promote effective utilization of manpower . Provide for employee convenience , safety , and comfort in doing the work . All of these objectives might be summarized as the planning of the plant for the best relationship between output , space , and manufacturing cost . Output might be measured in dollar volume or in units of product . Space might be measured in square feet of floor or in cubic feet in the building structure . Manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is an optimum balance between these three , the attainment of which is made possible through effective plant layout . Factors Affecting Plant Layout Many of the basic factors that affect the design of the product , the design of the manufacturing process , the selection of tools and equipment , and the planning for materials handling carry over to influence the plant layout . We shall discuss some of these in the folloinararh // Product . The type of product affects plant layout in many ways . Large and heavy equipment requires assembly bays . Also , in these cases it is often more economical to move the men and machines to the product than it is to move the product to the work area . Small and light products can be moved effectively , thus more attention can be given to machine locations and the handling of materials . Bulk products , such as cereals , gravel , or cement , more or less dictate a multi-story layout in order that the advantage of gravity can be utilized in the movement of the material . Volume or rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing planning . In plant layout it is reflected in the total size of the operation to be planned as well as being the principal factor in the determination of the type of manufacture to be employed . Quality . The meeting of quality requirements in a product can be aided through effective plant layout . Soundproof rooms , " white " rooms , and air-conditioned factories are often needed to meet product specifications . In other cases the handling and storage of products ? particularly if they may deteriorate ? may contribute to the maintenance of the proper quality level . Equipment . Adequate space must be provided for all equipment ? manufacturing , materials handling , and service . Equipment specifications are of major importance to the plant-layout engineer . Type of manufacture . It is obvious that a plant laid out for a continuous manufacturing process will be quite different from a factory operating as an intermittent plant . However , it should be pointed out that the advantages of continuous manufacture are such that it should be employed by the plant-layout engineer at every feasible opportunity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary continuous lines whenever the rate of production warrants . Building . Ideally , a building should be built to suit the best plant layout . This ideal is seldom attained . The adapting of a factory layout to an old building presents a real challenge to the plant-layout engineer . All proposals for modification of the existing structure must be economically justified . Even when a new building is to be constructed some compromise usually is required . Plant site . The plant site is the connecting link between the factory and the surrounding community . Services such as railroad sidings , highways , and utilities may easily affect not only the positioning of the building on the plot but the internal arrangement of the departments as well . // may within its own boundaries be safe yet endanger other workers in the general area . This calls for protective screens or possible relocation of the process . Comfort is considered in the location of rest rooms , drinking fountains , and other personnel services . Materials handling plan . Basic to economical production is good materials flow and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skeleton on which the plant layout fits , it is inseparably tied in with the layout function . Thus , plant layout ties together the manufacturing plan and , in this way , dictates the specifications of the materials handling equipment . This plan also includes the providing of adequate aisles for movement of materials and the allocation of space for storage ? not only in stock rooms but at the work stations . Each and every one of the above factors presents a problem to the plantlayout engineer . We must realize that a solution that is completely favorable in all ways is seldom reached . As in most design situations a compromise must be made to attain an optimum solution . The Basic Plans for Plant Layout Before discussing how plant layouts are made , we should identify the two basic plans for the arrangement of manufacturing equipment . These basic plans are the process layout and the product layout . Selection of the basic plan to be used depends upon many factors ; however , of these , the type of product and the type of manufacture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layout the type and operational characteristics of the manufacturing equipment are the determining factors in the arrangement of the factory . This basic plan can be readily identified , as such plants will have machine departments , cleaning departments , finishing rooms , and assembly floors . Even within such departments machines of similar work characteristics are commonly grouped together ( lathes , milling machines , drill presses , and so on ) . Product Layout in product layout the work to be performed on the product is the determining factor in the positioning of manufacturing equipment . The aim is to arrange machines in the order of the operations that are performed on the many component parts , on subassemblies , and on the final assembly of the item being manufactured . Thus each work station either machine or workbench // preceding work station , then passes the product to the next work station in the line where the next operation is performed . There are relative advantages for each of the basic types of layout . These advantages , together with comments as to when each type is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking , the process layout is characteristic of intermittent manufacturing , and the product layout is most common in continuous manufacturing . Process layout is probably the most common in industry today . However , with current trends towards automation the future may find more and more product layout in factories . Both types present real challenges to the plant-layout engineer . In process layout he must so arrange departments ? and subdepartmentsthat the material is moved with the least effort over minimum distances . This problem also holds true for product layout ; however , it is complicated by the problem of " balancing out the line . " Organization for Plant Layout If the plant-layout activity in a manufacturing plant is to be effective there must be a well defined responsibility for its accomplishment . Large concerns have special plant-layout departments ; smaller firms may designate the job as a part-time responsibility of one of the manufacturing staff or line . When a plant layout is required as a project ? that is , to meet a particular need and not to be maintained on a continuing basis ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made to determine on a quantitative basis the number of personnel in a manufacturing organization that should be engaged in this activity . These numbers generally are computed on the basis of the size of the plant , which is only one of many factors that might influence the need for plant-layout work . In reality , plant-layout departments must be measured by their contributions , both tangible and intangible , to the operation of the plant ? and the funds and personnel for this activity should be allocated accordingly . Plant layout is an advance planning activity . In determining the need for such an organization , management must consider the dynamic aspects of the manufacturing problem . If change is anticipated , owing to model changes , new products , technological improvements , or other causes , a plant-layout group will probably pay dividends . A plant-layout organization is usually a part of the industrial engineering activity . However , it may report to the plant engineer , other department heads , or possibly direct to the plant management . In any event , in its activities the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in manufacturing planning . // There is one prime characteristic that should be considered in the selection of personnel for this activity . That characteristic is creativeness ! For optimum effectiveness plant-layout engineers must be able to think creatively . They should not be bound by convention ; they must be original in their planning . Only by such an approach can a plant-layout group pay maximum dividends to operating management . Plant-Layout Procedure As in most industrial activities there is a sound approach to the plantlayout problem . First let us list the steps briefly , then discuss each in detail . In solving a plant-layout problem : 1 . Accumulate all the basic data that will be needed . 2 . Analyze and coordinate these basic data . 3 . Determine a general flow pattern for the materials in process . 4 . Design the individual work stations or production centers. 5 . " Assemble " the individual layouts into the total layout in accordance with the general flow pattern and the building facilities . 6 . Coordinate this plan with the plan for the handling of materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prepare an appropriation request indicating the funds needed and justifying the expenditure of these funds . 9 . Convert the plant layout into floor plans that can be used by the plant engineer in the location and installation of the equipment . This is the general pattern of attack . But from time to time the sequence may be changed to advantage . Basic data . Basic data must be procured from practically every other function in the manufacturing organization . Standard process sheets from the process engineering group are needed to show how the product is to be made and the tools and equipment required . If the time standards are not already posted on this form , they will have to be obtained in order to determine the anticipated rates of production for each operation . In some companies this information is consolidated on a flow process chart , which coordinates all operations into the complete process required for the manufacture of the product . Equipment lists and the specifications of the equipment must be obtained to determine the space requirements and the productive capacity of the machines involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the building plans and specifications . From these plans the available space can be determined . From the production planning and control group information must he obtained regarding the required volume // and rate of production . And , finally , from the product engineer complete specifications of the product and bills of materials should be procured . Analysis and coordination . Careful analysis and coordination of the basic data by the plant-layout engineer is needed to determine : 1 . The total number of employees that will be required . 2 . The total number of work stations that must be planned for . 3 . The kind , size , and number of every piece of equipment that must be accommodated in the layout . 4 . Total space requirements for storage of inventories , including raw materials , work-in-process , and finished goods . A more detailed and graphic description of the channels for this analysis is given in Figure 10-2 . Each part of the solution gained through this analysis should be questioned by the plant-layout engineer . All answers should be coordinated and carefully evaluated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be made to good advantage , such changes should be recommended to the proper planning group . This is the initial compromise point in plant layout . Flow pattern . Analysis and evaluation of the basic data will indicate the basic plan for the layout ? process or product . After the selection of a basic plan , a general pattern of flow for the product should be determined . For a process layout this results in a tentative arrangement of the various functional departments involved in the manufacturing process . Tn the product layout it is a general plan for the location of the many processing and assembly lines . These general flow patterns are indicated in the block layouts shown in Figures 10-3 and 10-4 . We should again remind ourselves that most industrial plants are actually a " mix " of these two basic types of layout plan . Work stations . The individual work station or production center is the key in plant layout . Each station should be laid out for the most effective performance of the operation , taking into account space for storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and worker safety and comfort . A typical work station layout is shown in Figure 10-5 . Prepare plant layout . Now the parts of the jigsaw puzzle must be fitted together within the frame of the picture . Work stations are arranged in accordance with the flow pattern and within the space limitations of the building structure . Also at this point allowances must be made for aisles , storage areas , cranes , offices , services , and all other such facilities . Again , each individual location should he evaluated and all possible solutions to the problem considered . This is another point for many compromises . However , every possibility must be considered and the best combination selected ? it is much easier to move templates and models than it is to rearrange machines and equipment on the factory floor ! Materials handling . The final solution of the materials handling problem is concurrent with the arrangement of the plant layout . A good plant layout makes for more efficient handling of materials . Likewise the selection of the most adaptable materials handling equipment contributes toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Appropriation request . The work of the plant-layout engineer seldom ends with the completion of the arrangement of the plant on paper . At every point in the making of the layout , cost must be considered . This cost is a total cost it takes into consideration all factors involved . One of these // figure factors is the cost of installing and arranging the equipment in accordance with the layout plan . These installation costs must now be assembled in the form of an appropriation request for the money required to convert the plan into actuality . This proposal must be defended before management , and to do so effectively the plant-layout engineer must be thoroughly prepared with facts and figures . Tn any event the successful plant-layout engineer must at all times be cost-conscious . Floor plans . After the plant layout has been approved , the final step is to arrange the physical facilities . Tn some instances this can be done directly from the layout , in others it is necessary to interpret the layout in the form of floor plans that can be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When such plans are required their preparation is generally the last step taken by the plant-layout group in completing their job . However , close liaison with all parties involved is usually necessary until the last machine or piece of equipment is installed and the plant is put into operation . We might well ask if this completes the useful life of the plant layout . This is , of course , a question of the stability of the manufacturing process . if changes can be anticipated it is much easier to work them out by advance planning on an " active " plant layout . The maintenance of an up-to-date // figure layout of a factory requires effective communications between the plantlayout group and all other manufacturing functions . Too often moves may be made in the shop without either consulting the plant-layout engineer or advising him of the change . If this condition is permitted to continue , the effectiveness of the keeping of the actual layout is lost . Plant-Layout Techniques A detailed discussion of the exact methods whereby plant layouts are made is beyond the scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid strides have been made in this field . Materials and procedures have been developed that not only base materials on which layouts are constructed consist of : ( l ) plastic sheets or boards on which grid lines have been printed or scribed , ( 2 ) metal-faced plywood with an appropriate finish on the metal , ( 3 ) sheet metal , plywood , or composition board with an appropriate finish , and ( 4 ) // drawing paper or tracing paper . Many two- and three-dimensional templates are available commercially and can be procured . Self-adhering transparent tapes are available showing standard aisles , conveyors , arrows for indicating materials flow , walls and partitions , as well as other parts of the layout that used to be inked in by a draftsman . In many concerns standard templates and models are available , saving the time the plant-layout engineer would spend making measurements on the shop floor . Templates can he readily reproduced on foil either by photographic means or by Bruning or Ozalid processes . Double-coated self-adhering tape is used for mounting both templates and models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new method moves can be made easily during the planning of the layout . Types of Layouts Two principal types of plant layouts are in use in modern industry . These are : 1 . Two-dimensional transparent template layouts . 2 . Three-dimensional model layouts . Prior to the preparation of either of these it is common practice to make a third type , a block layout . Block layouts . Block layouts are shown in Figures 10-3 and 10-4 . This type of layout is usually prepared to a scale of 4 inch equals one foot . It is a preliminary layout for study of materials flow patterns . By use of this technique a decision can be made as to the general arrangement of the plant before proceeding with the more detailed layout . Block layouts may be either two- or three-dimensional . Figure 10-4 shows a three-dimensional block layout constructed with sheets of plexiglass . Template layouts . This is probably the most common type of plant layout . Modern techniques are characterized by the fact that the layouts are transparent and copies can be duplicated direct from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes . A template layout is commonly prepared to the scale of a inch equals one foot . Figure 10-6 shows a transparent layout and Figure 10-7b shows a print duplicated from this transparency . Some of the advantages of the two-dimensional layout are : 1 . It is the least costly . 2 . It can be readily interpreted by technical personnel . 3 . Duplicate copies can be made . On the other hand the disadvantages of the two-dimensional layout are : PLANT LAYOUT 193 figure 1 . It is hard to visualize overhead equipment and check clearances for same . 2 . Interpretation by non-technical personnel is difficult . Model layouts . These layouts are not so common , probably owing to the expense involved . However , for the construction of new plants using any overhead equipment in the way of conveyors , cranes , or mezzanine installations , this type of layout should receive serious consideration . Model layouts are prepared to the same scale as template layouts - 41 inch equals one foot . Model or three-dimensional layouts are shown in Figure 10-8 . The relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helps " sell " the layout to management . 2 . Aids the visualization of the layout by non-technical personnel . 3 . Facilitates the work of the plant-layout engineer in making the layout ; models can be shifted quickly for study of optional arrangements . 4 . Different arrangements can be photographed for comparative purposes . 5 . Provides means for checking overhead structures . Disadvantages of the three-dimensional layout are : 1 . High cost . 2 . Requires storage area . // figure 3 . Can not be taken down to the shop floor for reference purposes . 4 . For full effectiveness a two-dimensional layout has to be prepared from the model layout for informational purposes . Principles of Plant Layout Over the years many principles have been developed for the guidance of the plant-layout engineer . In spite of this there is considerable art still involved in plant layout . Application of these principles is based more on a " cut-andtry " approach than on quantitative measurements . Considerable research has been conducted and is being continued to achieve a more scientific approach to the solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attempt to balance assembly lines by mathematical models . Most assembly-line balancing has been done by trial and error methods . Recent research has resulted in several computeroriented computational methods which are now being used in industry . These methods usually direct the computer to investigate all possible group-figure // ings of the assembly tasks and then to obtain the best grouping for a given set of conditions . New heuristic ' methods have been developed that offer considerable promise for the future . Some of the principles of plant layout that have proven sound are : 1 . Move materials minimum distances . This principle brings out the concept of " straight-line " production . However , in many instances it is more practical to take circular paths such as found in " merry-go-rounds " used in many production foundries. 2 . Avoid or minimize the back-tracking of materials . Backtracking will not only increase the distance of movement but can result in congestion of the channels of materials handling . 3 . Plan for a minimum of materials handling . The advantage here has been discussed earlier in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure footnote 3See " Use Heuristic Production Line Balancing to Save on Material Handling , " Material Handling Engineering ( February 1963 ) , p. 61. // figure the effectiveness of the plant layout will make a major contribution to this end . 4 . Use manufacturing space economically . This applies not only to the production areas but to the storage areas as well . In the past it has been common practice to regard this principle in terms of square feet of floor space only . Current trend is to consider the cubic space in the building . In many plants overhead conveyors are now being utilized as a storage device . 5 . Permit all flexibility possible . The chance of change should always be considered and the equipment arranged so that changes can be made at a minimum of cost or disturbance of the manufacturing process . This is a problem of the automotive industry where model changes are involved . 6 . Allow for possible plant expansion . The plant-layout engineer should always consider increase in production when planning the arrangement of a factory . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have been // established by experience in plant layout . For example , it is not considered good practice to place large and expensive installations such as heat-treating equipment or drying ovens for finishes centrally ? preferred practice is to locate them along an outer wall . However , such practices are not yet generally accepted as fundamentals of plant layout . Evaluation of Plant Layouts Evaluation as to which ? if any ? plan represents the best plant layout is difficult . As we have noted , the objective is to get optimum output of product with a minimum of manufacturing space . There are , however , so many other factors that influence the productive efficiency of a plant that to measure the effectiveness of the layout by this alone can hardly be accepted as conclusive . Analysis of the materials handling involved is another possible measure of layout effectiveness . It might well be assumed that the layout that results in the minimum of handling of materials is the best . On the other hand this layout might be much more costly in equipment and installation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layout and the continuing development of these techniques will contribute to the arriving at a good solution to a plant-layout problem . Nevertheless , good creative thinking and sound judgment on the part of the plant-layout engineer is prerequisite to a successful layout of a manufacturing plant . QUESTIONS 1 .

CASE PROBLEMS Peerless Automotive Company For many years the Peerless Automotive Company has made use of threedimensional models for laying out its plant . These models are made by two craftsmen in the company 's own model shop and are made as accurately as possible . The plant layout section of the industrial engineering department is responsible for planning the layout of all machines and equipment prior to installing these items in the shop . Since the company has annual model changes that require changes in the production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the new models of automobiles . The three-dimensional layout is made on a number of large boards to the scale of 1 inch = 1 foot . This layout is considered the master layout of the plant , and all changes on the board must be approved by the plant superintendent , the foreman , and the chief industrial engineer prior to making any changes in the factory . Some persons have questioned the expense of building the models and maintaining the elaborate layout boards , but Alfred Smith , head of the industrial engineering department , contends that the expenditure for this type of layout is compensated for many times over by the savings realized . Further , he argues that this type of layout provides a degree of accuracy ( plus or minus three inches on the plant floor ) not afforded by other layout techniques . Questions : 1 . Do you agree with Alfred Smith ? Why ? 2 . What benefits does Peerless Automotive gain from its system of plant layout which it probably would n't get from other systems ? 3 .

The president of the company has decided that the employees ' request is reasonable and that a cafeteria should be included in a new wing of a building that is being planned .

Effective control of men , materials , machines , and money contributes towards the making of profits so essential to the free-enterprise system . In the next few chapters of Section III we shall discuss primarily the control of materials ? their procurement and storage ? and the processing of these materials by men and machines . First , however , let us study the fundamentals and principles that are common to all control procedures . Control Fundamentals No matter which of the elements of manufacturing you plan to control , either singly or in combination , there must be four basic phases in the control system . All of these basic control steps are interdependent and dynamic in all manufacturing situations . The breaking down of any control problem into these four phases , and the determination of the effective operation of each step will materially assist in the attainment of a satisfactory solution . These four basic control phases are : 1 . There must be a plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 3 . Actual performance must be continually compared to and evaluated with the plan . 4 . Provisions must be made for corrective action in manufacturing operations when the results of the evaluation indicate the need for such action . Let us briefly investigate why each of these steps is essential . 203 // Plan . A state of control can never exist unless some sort of a plan has been made . One characteristic of today 's industrial enterprise is the formulation of long-range plans , covering periods of from 5 to 15 years , or possibly longer . These plans involve all functions of the business ? marketing , manufacturing , personnel , finance ? and are based upon the policies and decisions of top management . Manufacturing , on the other hand , is more often concerned with shortrange plans that are made within the structure of the long-range plan . These short-range plans are made to cover that period of time during which the activities of manufacturing are fairly certain or " firm , " for example , a 30-day production schedule showing daily output during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget ? either in money or number of men ? to be used for the maintenance of equipment is another short-range plan . Day-to-day planning may be necessary for the effective implementation of the short-range plan . The planning of daily work assignments to meet the requirements of the 30-day schedule also may be necessary . Plans can be identified with men , materials , machines , or money , or with any combination of these elements of manufacturing . However , in making a plan a " common yardstick " for measurement must be established . Any one of these elements may be used as a basis for measurement but the most common base for measurement ? and as a result the foundation for most planning ? is either money or time . Time is the common denominator to which practically all manufacturing elements can be resolved . Actual performance . All effort used in making plans is a total loss unless attempts are made to follow these plans in the manufacturing activity . Keeping records of actual performance on the same basis of measurement as the plan is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comparison and evaluation . The comparison of the records of actual performance to the plan and the evaluation of the results tells us how well the plan was made and how well it is being followed . When the actual performance meets the planned performance the manufacturing situation is said to be " in control . " When performance fails to meet the plan the situation is considered " out of control . " It is possible to be " in control " and still not be operating at optimum efficiency ; such a situation should be evident in the broad evaluation of performance . Another aspect of evaluation is the prediction of possible failures in the manufacturing activity by a study of trends in performance . Anticipation of possible production bottlenecks or materials shortages by careful study of performance is one of the most valuable tools of management . // Corrective action . Ideally , no corrective action should ever be necessary . Realistically , corrective action is the most important aspect in a control situation . Modern manufacturing is too complex to anticipate all possibilities of delays and failures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the allowance of too much time or money in anticipation of such problems is not good planning . As a result corrective action is often necessary and should he taken without hestitation . There is a difference between correction and replanning . Corrective action does not recognize any change in the original plan , for the objective of the corrective action is to get operations back on the original schedule or budget . Generally speaking , schedules and budgets should not be changed to meet failures in performance . When such changes are made , the performance of the plant is the controlling element ? not the plan . It is because of this that a state of control seldom exists except where effective corrective action is being taken . Replanning . Replanning has its place in modern control situations . However , it is most effective when used to improve the making of plans in the future . The key to successful manufacturing controls is the constant improvement of all plans for the manufacture and distribution of goods . The use of a " re-plan " to compensate for failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is aware of all the circumstances involved . Common Characteristics of Good Control Procedures For optimum results there must be a clearly defined objective for every manufacturing control situation . This objective should state what is to be controlled and the degree of control that is to be maintained . Control is a tool of management that requires careful study and analysis in order to avoid the establishment of controls for the sake of control only . Too often many controls are planned that contribute little , if anything , to the efficient operation of the factory . The objective of the control system must receive careful and continuing consideration when establishing the goals of plans . In a sense the objectives control the plans , which in turn are used for the control of manufacturing . In like manner any change in the ultimate plan ? or replanning ? automatically affects the objective . Replanning should be permitted only when the objectives of the control situation can be changed without excessive loss . " Degree of control " means how close a control needs to be maintained . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or week ? Must an accurate inventory count be made of all parts at all stages in their processing ? It is obvious that there is a point of diminishing returns where the value of // such records no longer justifies the cost of their accumulation . If possible , the desired degree of control should be clearly stated in terms of the objective of the system of control . The design and installation of control systems presents a challenging problem to the industrial engineer . Some " bench marks " of good control procedures for the analysis or designing of control systems are discussed in the following paragraphs . Simplicity . Control systems should be made as simple as possible . The fewer the forms or records that must be maintained , the easier the system is to operate , and the fewer opportunities for error . Simple systems are also easily understood by the personnel involved . Low cost . This is an obvious " bench mark . " As we shall see in later discussion of the many manufacturing controls , the savings that those controls make are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult . Adequate and timely information . This is a principal characteristic of the second phase in a control system : the recording of actual performance . Determination of the adequacy of information the system will obtain requires considerable judgment . Enough information must be gathered for the making of decisions ; however , in many cases the accumulation of all the information that might seem desirable is too costly . An economic balance must be struck between record costs and the value of the information obtained . Information must also be timely . If trouble spots are to be anticipated and corrective action taken , all records must be up to date . Learning of the failure to meet a production schedule a week or month ago does not permit taking steps to avoid such failure . Timely information predicts before the completion date that the schedule will not be met ? this is the indication that corrective action is necessary . Flexibility . Although it is generally agreed that replanning should be held to a minimum , a certain amount is almost always necessary . This requires changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In much the same manner corrective action will require adjustments in plans and schedules . A good control system permits the making of such changes without " upsetting the apple cart " and with a minimum of confusion and expense . Permit management by exception . The system of reporting actual performance and comparing and evaluating it with the control plan should be such that only situations that require corrective action are brought to the immediate attention of management or supervisory personnel . This is , of // course , the basic principle of management by exception . However , procedures should be so established that corrective decisions can be made at the lowest level possible in the management structure . Force planning and corrective action . A control system can be so designed that management and the personnel operating the system are continually forced to look ahead . Manufacturing control is dynamic in every aspect ; it is not a static or " one-shot " affair . Good control plans should foster better planning for future operations . Also , good control plans force corrective action by signaling failures to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People One other area is common to all manufacturing control problems : people . In all cases people are involved ? both management and labor . It makes little difference whether the industrial engineer is planning a new system of control or is concerned with the continuing effectiveness of an existing plan of control . At all times the personal factor must be considered . All personnel must first recognize the advantages of and the need for the effective control of the manufacturing activity . Next they must be " sold " on the system of control to be used , and finally they must be educated and trained for its effective operation . Recognition of need . A definite recognition of the need for the control must be established . In many cases , as we shall see later , this is not too hard to do . Losses owing to ineffective controls can be identified and savings that will result from better controls predicted . The biggest obstacle here is the natural human tendency to resist change . It is often difficult to sell a new control plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present system . The need for control must be clearly defined and kept constantly before all people involved . Selling the system . A successful control procedure requires the full cooperation of all manufacturing personnel ? from the operator on the machine or assembly line to the top management . Effective control is everybody 's job . Many a plan has failed because not everyone involved believed in the need for the control or in the procedure planned for the system . Education and training . A sound program of education and training will materially influence the success of any control program . This means the education and training of all , from the top management personnel on down to the worker . Of course , more detailed education and training is indicated // for the personnel who will actually operate the system . Again , this also is not necessarily a one-time affair . Control systems maintain their optimum effectiveness only when a continuing program of education and training is conducted . Basic Causes of Control Failure Many well-designed control systems fail to produce the anticipated results . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failures . However , we can briefly consider a few of the principal reasons why a control system or procedure does not function properly . Any control system can be likened to a chain : it is as strong or effective as its weakest link . Most control procedures are in reality a system of industrial communications consisting of many steps . At each of these steps information is fed into the system , drawn from the system , or accumulated and compared with the goals of the plan . A failure at any point in the pro-cedure " contaminates " all subsequent results that are recorded or observed by control personnel . All information up to the point of failure is valid ; after the point of failure all information is inaccurate and may contribute to inefficient operation of the plant . An entire system of control should not be condemned when in all prob-ability failure can be isolated to only one ? or at most a few ? steps in the procedure . There are two basic sources of trouble : operating personnel and basic data . Operating personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes should be relieved of their assignments . This , however , may be only a short-range correction of the problem . The failure of a clerk may be due to lack of proper training . He did not understand the " what , " " how , " and " why " of his duties or their importance . In the preceding paragraphs we discussed the importance of education and training of personnel if the control procedure is to be effective . Also , we pointed out that personnel who are thoroughly competent must be " sold " on the system . Sometimes a system fails because a single person does not do his job . Basic data . The results obtained from any control procedure are no better than the accuracy of the information fed into the system . Inaccurate costs , standard times , inventory counts , or any one of the other items o basic data upon which the system operates will result in poor performance . One grossly inaccurate estimate either as to cost or production time for a large component part of a product may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reporting of an inaccurate count of materials in a massFUNDAMENTALS // production plant may result in a complete shutdown of the lines . Basic data must be as accurate as the degree of control demands . Degree of control determines the degree of accuracy required in basic data . In a highly competitive market of consumer goods , costs must be controlled to tenths of one cent or possibly closer . For custom manufacture of heavy apparatus control need not be so close . In an inventory some items must be accurately accounted for ; others may be counted in hundreds and this count made monthly or possibly only once a year . Basic data must be accurate within the units of measure that are dictated by the degree of control . Control as a Tool of Management Any control procedure or system is a tool of management and not an end in itself . Maintenance of control communications and records must be justified by savings resulting either from their use in planning future operations or from the improved efficiency of day-to-day manufacture . Every system of control has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make decisions ; they simply indicate when decisions are necessary and possibly what decision should be made . Effective use of manufacturing controls depends upon the considered judgment of the people involved . There must be a thorough understanding of the control system and of the extent and validity of the information resulting from the communication procedures in the system . The objective of the system must be in evidence at all times . The least control that accomplishes the objective is the best control . The fewer the records , reports , and steps in the control procedure , the simpler and less costly the system . This is a simple principle ; however , the realization of this overall objective is difficult . QUESTIONS 1 . How would you apply the fundamentals of control to one of your own activities ? 2 .

CASE PROBLEMS Midwest Manufacturing Company Upon his return from the management conference in New York City , William Brown , the vice president in charge of manufacturing for Midwest Manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads . Those present included the managers of methods analysis , research , engineering , and time standards . Mr. Brown pointed out to the group that while in New York he had heard a very stirring talk regarding the fundamentals of control and their use in manufacturing , and he wanted to be certain that his organization was making full use of these fundamentals . He then distributed copies of the talk to those present and asked each to study it carefully . As soon as possible , each manager was to come back to Mr. Brown and discuss how his particular department was making use of these control fundamentals or how they were planning to make use of them in the future . Questions : 1 . Explain how the fundamentals of control can be used in the departments represented at the meeting . 2 . Does Mr. Brown have any role to play in the carrying out of the control concept by the four department managers ? In other words , how can he apply the control concept to his job ? 3 . Comment on Mr. Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his organization . Meldrum Manufacturing Co . At a meeting with all his department heads Mr. Wilson Waterman , the factory manager of Meldrum Manufacturing Co. , was discussing the use of automation in the plant . He expressed the opinion that the word had been overused and misused a great deal and that the true meaning related to a process that makes use of the fundamentals of control . He said a good example of automation is the temperature regulating system on home furnaces . Mr. Balsa , the chief engineer , questioned this concept of automation and pointed out that a $100,000 machine recently installed by the company to produce plastic moldings automatically looked like automation to him . He emphasized // the fact that this machine replaced a battery of 6 older machines and could be operated by one man while each of the older machines required 2 men . Questions : I. Does automation include all four fundamentals of control ? Explain . 2 . Does a temperature regulating device on a home furnace employ the four fundamentals of control ? Explain . 3 . Outline Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What general features would have to be included on the $100,000 machine to make it conform to Mr. Waterman 's concept of automation ? CHAPTER TWELVE Inventory Management and Control For the next few chapters we shall be primarily interested in the control of material in manufacturing . Actually , we are concerned with the control of the " flow " of material from a " raw " state to a finished product . Most industries buy material , transport it to the plant , change the material into finished products , and sell and transport the product to the customer . In our discussion of manufacturing controls , we will consider the planning for optimum quantities of material at all stages in the above-mentioned cycle , and the design and establishment of systems of control to attain this objective , as inventory management . The actual steps taken to maintain proper stock levels in " raw " material and finished goods we will refer to as inventory control . Control of the material as it is being processed will be covered in a later chapter on production control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? or procurement ? and traffic , which is generally considered to cover the movement of material to and from the plant , we complete our coverage of the entire flow cycle from the buying of raw materials to the delivery of the product to the customer . With the continuous development of industry , the importance of this total field of activity in material is steadily increasing . Improved methods and mechanization have contributed to the trend of a greater material dollar content in each product and a reduced labor or machine dollar content . As a result in some concerns the functions of material control ? inventory management , purchasing , inventory control , production control , and traffic ? have been grouped under one function of material management . 212 // Inventory Classifications Much as we identify the various functions in material management with the flow of goods , we can identify the different types of inventories or stocks of material maintained in a manufacturing plant . All plants use the same general classification of inventories , including raw material , purchased parts , work-in-process , finished goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventory includes all items that after being received at the plant require additional processing before becoming an identifiable part of the finished product . It is obvious that the finished product of one plant ? such as roll , bar , and sheet steel ? may be the raw material for the next industrial purchaser . Purchased parts . This classification of inventory is applied to component parts of a product that need no additional processing before being assembled into the finished product . In some cases this material may be classified as raw material inventory . More times than not , however , a separate classification is justified . The carburetor that is the finished product of one manufacturer becomes a purchased part to the automobile manufacturer . Work-in-process . This classification of inventory is self-explanatory . All material that leaves either raw material stores or purchased parts stores enters the work-in-process inventory until the product is completed and placed in finished goods . This is the inventory of material the flow of which is controlled by production control procedures to be discussed later . Finished goods . Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products . Generally speaking this classification applies to the quantities of finished goods that are held at the factory awaiting shipment . In many instances , however , it will include stocks held in warehouses owned and operated by the manufacturer , or stocks held on dealers ' floors on consignment . In this latter case the value of the finished goods inventory is usually very high and a principal factor in the financial problem of the company . A typical example of this is the piston ring manufacturer who in addition to supplying the original car manufacturer also maintains large stocks of many different sizes of piston rings in automotive supply houses for quick service to the auto repairman . All of these stocks are on consignment ; that is , the piston ring manufacturer does not receive any payment for the goods until they have been sold by the distributor . Supplies . All the materials needed for the operation of the plant that are not used as parts of the finished product are classified as supplies . // The chapter on cost accounting identifies this inventory classification as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the material that becomes part of the finished product is called " direct material . " Lubricating oils , sweeping compound , light bulbs , and many other items fall into the supply category . Optimum Inventories The complex relationship between modern industry and its market presents a real problem in the size of inventories that should be maintained . Large inventories in the face of declining sales mean lower profits . Small and inadequate inventories in the face of an increasing market demand may result in the loss of sales to competitors ? and a decreased profit . Recognition of these conditions should indicate that the optimum inventory is not necessarily either the minimum or the maximum level of inventory ; nor is it operation at a maximum inventory turnover . Inventory turnover . A very common index of inventory control is equal to the ratio of the value of the product shipped to the average invest ment in inventory for the same period . Obviously , the higher this index , the lower the inventory levels and the lower the cost of maintaining the inventories . Also it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the saving inherent therein . Inventories represent a financial investment : the purchase price paid for the material , the cost of labor applied to goods that are in process or finished , and the cost of handling and storage . A determination of the proper ratio of this investment to operating profits can be used to establish optimum inventory levels for all classes of inventory . This may be done on a historical basis or by empirical means . On the other hand , it presents one of the most lucrative fields for investigation by use of the tools of operations research . The planning of optimum inventory levels by inventory management requires close cooperation with the marketing function . Market trends must be predicted accurately and inventory levels adjusted ? increased when increased sales are anticipated , and decreased when a lower sales volume can be foreseen . This is a problem in both marketing and manufacturing communications and again presents an opportunity for research and development of scientific means for determination of the proper solutions . Inventory models . In Chapter 5 we discussed the basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This basic mathematical model also may be used to determine optimum inventory levels . However , it should be re-emphasized that this model does not take into account a number of factors ( e.g. , price discounts , warehousing costs , which may vary with maximum inventory rather than average inventory , budgetary limitations ) and suitable mathematical models should be developed to fit specific situations . In actual practice , the use of formulas is so time-consuming that they are not often used . Rather , tables , charts , and nomograms based upon suitable formulas , and more recently computers , are used to minimize computations . Factors Influencing Inventory Management and Control Many factors influence inventory management and control . The principal effects of these factors are reflected most strongly in the levels of inventory and the degree of control planned in the inventory control system . Type of product . If the materials used in the manufacture of the product have a high unit value when purchased , a much closer control is usually in order . The jeweler is much more careful of his stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of low-priced costume jewelry . This same principle holds in manufacturing . If the raw material used in the product is available only in a short or controlled market , this may easily influence the purchase of this material and the level of inventories maintained . In the past this has been true in the tin can industry . Purchasing agents had to watch the world tin market very closely and buy large stocks of tin at the right time as controlled by the price rather than by the production demand of the factory producing the cans . The manufacture of standard products as compared to production of custom items will influence the inventory problem . Standard products are usually made in greater quantities and at higher rates of production ; also it is good practice to use raw material and purchased components that are standard items of the supplier . As a result , material is easier to obtain and the control of the inventory need not be so close . In addition , there is a greater chance of getting back the investment in the case of overages in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " affair . Close control is required to insure that special material and parts are not lost during manufacture . A special item worth only a few dollars may hold up the production of an order worth several thousands to the manufacturer . This situation occurs particularly when producing heavy equipment , such as special machine // tools , large steam turbine generator sets , buildings , or ships . On the other hand expensive items , like motors and controls or other major components that represent a large investment , should not be received too far in advance of the date on which they are required . Tnventory planning in such cases extends to include careful analysis of the delivery of material . Type of manufacture . The close relationship between the type of product and the type of manufacture makes an analysis of the effect on inventory controls somewhat repetitious . Continuous manufacture is common to the manufacture of standard products . However , some standard products are made in batches . Where continuous manufacture is employed the rate of production is the key factor . Here , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance and in reality controls the production of the product . The economic advantage of this type of manufacture is the uninterrupted operation of the machines and assembly lines in the plant . It is a major offense on the part of the inventory control personnel to have the plant shut down for the lack of material . Intermittent manufacture on the other hand permits greater flexibility in the control of material . Delays in the receipt of goods do not result in plant shutdowns , and steps can be taken to make up for lost time after the delayed items are received . Volume . The volume of product to be made as represented by the rate of production may have little effect on the complexity of the inventory problem . Literally millions of brass bases for light bulbs are manufactured each month involving the control of only two principal items of raw material inventory . On the other hand the manufacture of a large locomotive involves the planning and control of thousands of items of inventory . Both the inventory problem and the difficulty of controlling production increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not with the quantity of products to be made . Inventory Management The planning of the control of inventory can be divided into two phases , inventory management and inventory control . Inventory management accomplishes the first phase , consisting of : 1 . Determination of optimum inventory levels and procedures for their review and adjustment . 2 . Determination of the degree of control that is required for the best results . 3 . Planning and design of the inventory control system . 4 . Planning of the inventory control organization . // The second phase of planning , which is the day-to-day planning required to meet production requirements , we shall discuss later as inventory control . Optimum inventory levels . Earlier , we discussed how inventory management is responsible for determining the inventory level that will result in the best profit . We have already pointed out that the trend of sales must be watched closely and inventories adjusted in advance of the change in rate of production as determined by actual sales . But this is not the only factor that must be considered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual production of the product may involve problems of leveling production , that is , producing at a constant rate even though sales may fluctuate . In slack times products are built to stock ; the finished goods inventory is increased to offset the demand anticipated when future sales surpass the production rate of the plant . The proper evaluation of this factor requires close cooperation with the manufacturing function . The actual level of the inventory may also be improved by a close study of the manufacturing cycle . How long does it take a shipment of steel to pass from the raw material inventory to its appearance in the finished goods inventory as a part of the product ? A study ? in cooperation with the manufacturing function of the ratio of actual processing time to waiting time may be most revealing ; and when unnecessary delays are eliminated , the level of the work-in-process inventory may be materially reduced . All these factors must be considered when inventory management seeks to establish the best inventory levels in all the different inventory classifications . It is easily recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced to a mathematical model as discussed in Chapter 5 . The interesting part of this problem is that it is not static . The picture is constantly changing ; hence inventory management must plan for the review of the results as often as is necessary . Determination of what is " necessary " is in itself a problem . Some industries with consumer goods products such as food , soaps and detergents , and clothes have built up records such that reviews are needed only when major economic trends are apparent . There is considerably more risk in high inventory levels in industries manufacturing items such as the automobile or household appliances . In concerns with a multi-product line , trends of sales of each product must be watched ; this is the case in furniture . Suffice it to say that once solved the problem of optimum inventory levels has just started ! Degree of control . Inventory management must decide just how much control is needed to accomplish the objective . The least control ? as evidenced by systems , records , and personnel ? that is required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This problem of the degree of control can be approached from the viewpoint of quantity , location , or time . // Economic purchase and manufacturing lot sizes are quantity considerations . These , however , are based largely on the economics of the supplier ? the vendor in the first case and the manufacturing function in the second ? and do not consider quantity from the viewpoint of the user . The user is concerned with the problem of optimum inventory quantities and the degree of control required for the maintenance of the planned inventory level . One approach that is gaining wide acceptance is the analysis of inventory requirements based upon the value of each item . Each item in the inventory is analyzed in relation to its yearly investment value . Almost inevitably it is found that a small percentage of the parts in the product represent a large portion of the inventory investment , while a large percentage of the parts actually require little investment of funds . For the " high-cost " items plans are made to keep close control of this inventory by accurate records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipments with production requirements . On the other hand , the items that are " low-cost " may simply be ordered in larger quantities covering several months ' need , no record being made of their issue to manufacturing . More stock is simply requested when the existing stock reaches a reorder point . The intermediate-value items may be established on a perpetual inventory but without the close control used for the high-value items . From the standpoint of location , the degree of control is the number of controlled storages or control points that are to be established in the flow of the material . It has been generally recognized that inventories can be accurately controlled only if placed in locked storerooms and if written records are made for each change in the amount of each item . A full and strict compliance with such instructions often results in the inventory control being a burden instead of a tool to facilitate efficient production . One manufacturer of small radios has found that an accurate count of incoming material is the only control point needed in the operation of the plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department . This , however , is an extreme case . How much inventory and of what classification requires controlled storage areas , and how often during the manufacturing cycle a record should be made of usage , is the problem of inventory management . The greater the number of controlled storages and control points , the greater are both the degree of control and the cost of maintaining it . ( Again we should point out that the control of inventories in storerooms is referred to as inventory control , and the control of inventories during manufacturing processes is production control . ) The preceding paragraphs have to do with the adequacy of inventory control information . Frequency is another factor in degree of control . How often should inventory reports be made ? One large plant makes a record of movement of all items in inventory every day , which through the use of machine records makes it possible to give management an accurate summary of the inventory each week or on a few hours ' notice if requested . Is such control necessary ? This is a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements of material through production control procedures are reported hourly in order that any possible delays on the assembly lines can be anticipated . Communications such as we have pointed out here are essential if a comparison of performance to plan ? an essential step in any control procedure ? is to be accomplished . The degree of timing planned for in any manufacturing situation must be justified by the prevention of losses that might be incurred if such communications were not in operation . Having determined optimum inventory levels and the degree of control to be established to maintain such levels , it then is the problem of inventory management to design the required inventory control system and plan the organization for its effective operation . This team of system and personnel comprises the function of inventory control in a manufacturing organization . Inventory Control The inventory control group puts the plans of inventory management into operation . These plans are seldom complete in every detail . The day-to-day planning required to meet production requirements ? the second phase of planning for inventory control ? is the responsibility of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transactions involving movement of material and of the effect on the different inventories . This is the picture of actual accomplishment by the plant of the flow of material . The comparison of this performance to the existing inventory plan , and the evaluation of the current material control situation , together comprise the next step in inventory control . The most important step , however , is the initiation of corrective actions . As we have indicated before , modern manufacturing requires careful planning . When applied , these plans often go astray ; manufacturing activities can be controlled only when such variations from the original plans are detected early enough to permit emergency measures that will bring production back into accord with the original schedule . Later we shall discuss some of the techniques involved in inventory control . First , however , let us bring both inventory management and inventory control into better focus by restating and expanding the objectives of these functions . Objectives of Inventory Management and Control The ultimate objective of all manufacturing controls is to realize a profit through the operation of the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to satisfy the customer by meeting the schedule for // deliveries . Failure to deliver orders on time is one principal cause for loss of business and customers . Effective control of the material throughout the manufacturing cycle prevents this problem from arising . Specific objectives of the inventory management and control group are to maintain optimum inventory levels and inventory turnover for operation of the business at maximum profit ? also , through the control of inventories , to insure that the right material , in the right quantity and of the right quality , is made available at the right place at the right time . Let us discuss very briefly some of the ways in which this is done . Inventory Control Systems Control of manufacturing inventories is basically a problem in industrial communications . Earlier we indicated that the complexity of these systems is directly proportional to the number of items in the inventories and to the number of transactions that have to be recorded to keep abreast of the movement of the material ( thus maintaining the degree of control needed to meet the objectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed , some form of perpetual inventory is usually employed . A sample perpetual inventory record is shown in Figure 12-1 . This type of record is called a " perpetual " inventory because a new inventory figure is determined after each transaction , so that at any time the quantity in inventory can be determined . It is evident that the keeping of such records for low-cost items may often cost more than the stock of items is worth . The basic information normally carried on perpetual inventory records includes : 1 . On order . This part of the record shows the quantity of material ordered but not received . New orders are added in this column and receipts subtracted . 2 . Received . All receipts are posted here ; there is no balance quantity in this column . 3 . On hand . This balance figure represents the quantity of the item that should be in the stock room . Receipts are added to this column and issues subtracted . 4 . Issued . A record of all quantities issued to the factory is entered in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the quantities to be reserved for later issue for specific orders . Reserving of materials still in the stock room will insure their availability when they are needed on the manufacturing floor . // 6 . Available . This is the quantity of material " on hand " that is still available for assignment to future orders . The above is fundamentally the information that can be obtained from any perpetual inventory record . In essence it shows at any given time the quantity of material that can be assigned to incoming orders , the quantity that is being held for orders already received and in process , and the quantity of material that has been ordered from the vendor or the shop and has not yet been received by the stockroom . Actual control of inventories is by the comparison of these levels of inventory to the planned level . Perpetual inventories are operated with a planned minimum available and generally with a reorder quantity that is greater than this value . When the availability reaches this reorder point a purchase requisition or shop order is originated and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Properly operated , a perpetual inventory system should never result in an oversupply of the item . However , a maximum is established , and if this should be approached by the availability quantity the situation should be investigated . In some cases a value of the inventory is also recorded . This presents a problem in determining values . Pricing Inventories . There are four basic ways to price inventories for accounting purposes : 1 . First in ? First out ( FIFO ) . Under this procedure all issues are priced at the cost of the oldest lot until that lot is used up . Then the price of the next oldest lot is used , and so on . In other words , the first price into the inventory is the first price out of the inventory when issuing materials . 2 . Last in ? First out ( LIFO ) . Under this procedure all issues are priced at the cost of the newest lot until that lot is used up . Then the price of the next to newest lot is used , and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , the price of this even newer lot is used when issuing material until the quantity involved is issued , at which time the price reverts to the next newest unused quantity . 3 . Average Value . Under this system the values of issues are computed by using the weighted average cost of the material in stock . As new material is received at slightly different prices , a new computation must be made as to the weighted average cost of the total material on hand . 4 . Standard Costs . A standard cost is established for each material and all disbursements are charged out at this standard value regardless of the price actually paid for the material . The standard cost is a calculation based upon possible replacement cost of the item , or an average of past purchase prices for that item . At any rate , the standard cost should be a good estimate of what the material in question should or will cost . As the price of new material varies from lot to lot , a difference between actual purchase price and disbursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is // charged to an inventory variation account and is finally cleared out at the end of the year to the profit and loss account . Two general points need to be made in connection with these pricing systems . The first point is that all systems deal with the problem of pricing and have nothing to do with the physical items themselves . A different set of policies will govern which items are being disbursed to the factory upon request . For example , if one is dealing with perishable items or with items that deteriorate with age , obviously one should issue these items on a firstin ? first out basis . On the other hand , an inventory of lead slabs will undoubtedly be issued on the basis of last in ? first out , from a practical point of view . The second general point is the fact that these systems of pricing have only to do with the accurate costing of a manufacturing process . In the end , all such inventory accounts must balance out to zero , for one is not attempting to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern is made by charging a price for the final product over and above the cost of producing that product . In properly pricing inventories we are simply attempting to accurately determine the cost of production . The FIFO and LIFO systems of pricing inventories have greatest application in businesses that deal with fairly large inventories of items held for long periods of time . Items where these systems come into use would include commodities such as corn , wheat , hides , and soybean oil ; and perhaps steel bars and other units , more or less standard , which may be stockpiled over a period of time . In general , the preference is to use the LIFO system during a period of inflation and the FIFO system during a period of deflation . In following such a guide the business man is attempting to get rid of his highest-priced items first and thereby place himself in a more favorable position in the future . Shifting from one system to another , however , can only be done with the permission of the Internal Revenue Service . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be largely between the average system and the standard cost system . Many items are used up during an accounting period and so it becomes unnecessary to consider either a LIFO- or FIFO-type system . In addition , many items are not necessarily affected to any large extent by inflation or deflation , and any fluctuation in price that takes place is relatively minor . In these cases the average system is quite satisfactory although it has the drawback of repeated mathematical manipulations each time a new shipment is received . This is one of the reasons why many companies follow the standard cost system even though it results in a variation in inventory value that must be charged off at the end of the year . Basic communication forms . The basic communication forms used in perpetual inventory control are : 1 . Purchase requisition . This form is prepared by inventory control when new quantities of material should be ordered . // 2 . Shop order . This form is prepared by inventory control when quantities of material need to be made by the shop for stock . 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received by the stock room . 4 . Stores requisition . This form authorizes the issuance of any class of inventory material from a controlled storage to the shop . These requisitions may be prepared by the production planner ( as we will discuss under production control ) or may be prepared by foremen , supervisors , or other authorized personnel . These four forms are the principal sources of basic data in inventory control . Their names , although in common use , are not standardized . The name given to the form is not important ; it is the function or purpose of the form that should be recognized at all times when evaluating its part in the inventory control procedure . Samples of these forms are shown in Figures 12-2 to 12-5 . In many inventory control systems other forms may be used . One of these will be an inspection report . This report will record the quality of the material , which may be raw material received from a vendor , or else com ponent parts , subassemblies , or assemblies produced by the factory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . ( The latter manu facturing control will be discussed in Chapter 15. ) // One fundamental principle is that the purchase requisition is the key to material control . The careful study of the procedures originating this form , as well as of the personnel authorized to sign the requisition , will result in control of inventory at its very beginning . Inventory can not exist in the plant unless raw material or purchased parts are ordered . Inventory control records and procedures . A detailed discussion of the many records and procedures that are used for control of inventories is beyond the scope of this text . There are many commerical systems such as Ditto , McCaskey Register , Remington Rand , International Business Machines ( IBM ) , and others too numerous to mention . Inventory records may be posted in ledgers or on cards with each entry made by hand . Basic data of inventory transactions may be punched on machine-records cards ( see Figure 12-6 ) and the many calculations or reports prepared by mechanical or electronic interpreters and computers . The form of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic computers with magnetic memory units are being used for perpetual inventory records . Large airlines maintain a record of available spaces on flights by such means . Large mail-order houses are using these new developments to advantage . Their use in manufacturing is also becoming more common . The industrial engineer planning an inventory control system has many methods open for his consideration . He can also ask expert advice from the // systems engineers employed by the manufacturers of the equipment that we have discussed above . In the final analysis , however , whatever system or method is adopted , the economics of the situation must govern the choice ? hand posting versus machine records , clerical payroll versus machine investment or rental . Bin control . We have discussed perpetual inventories at length . Again , they are applicable to what we have previously designated as high- or intermediate-value inventory items . It is still evident that such procedures as we have touched on briefly are costly . For those items in which the cost of keeping such records can not be justified a bin control is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is based on the minimum inventory quantity , reorder point , and maximum inventory quantity determined by the study of the numbers of items required to meet the production plans of the plant . When the material is stored in the bin , the quantity equal to the reorder // quantity is boxed or sealed . Material is issued from the bin without any record being made of the quantities issued . At the point where the " reserve " stock is required to fill the stores requisition , a purchase requisition is pre-pared and forwarded to the purchasing department . Material will then be purchased to bring the quantity of stock up to the maximum . The minimum stock may also be sealed or boxed within the reserve or reorder quantity . If this second seal is broken it indicates that the material previously ordered should be expedited . Bin control is a simple inventory control system . On the other hand , it should be realized that the minimums , as well as the reorder points , must be reviewed periodically in order that the stock of the item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Storerooms ( or stock rooms ) are areas in which material is held in controlled storage . All material received in the area is counted and recorded ; none is issued without the proper stores requisition . Controlling materials in such a manner costs money in terms of space , personnel , and handling . These costs must be offset by better service to the factory and reduced loss of materials . Proper location of storerooms must be related to the whole manufacturing process and considered when laying out the plant and deciding on the materials handling methods . Central storerooms require less personnel ; // decentralized storerooms , located with material near its point of use in the factory , require more personnel but usually cost less in the handling of material . Space allocated to storerooms is non-productive . As a result the general tendency is to reduce such space to a minimum , often crowding receiving and issuing areas until inefficiency results . There is a trend to evaluating store-rooms on a cubic-foot basis rather than a square-foot basis ? thus forcing the planner to utilize overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are often replaced by overhead conveyors that are used for storage . This point was discussed in the chapter on plant layout . However , in again considering the entire situation , perhaps the problem in storerooms is whether or not they are needed at all . In many plants material is simply stored near the point of usage , without any control-led storage . If storerooms are employed , the storekeeper should be held responsible for the material in his area . This can only be accomplished if the room is properly enclosed and locked and if only authorized personnel are permitted to handle the material being received or issued . Physical inventories . A physical inventory is used to verify the balances shown on the perpetual inventory records and to obtain a correct count on all items of inventory that may be on a bin control system . Physical inventories may be taken in two different ways . Using the first method , plans may be made for a complete shutdown of manufacturing activity . During this period teams will count all material in storerooms and on the shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage it has reached in the manufacturing process . After a complete physical count has been made , operation can be resumed . The effect of this procedure on production is self-evident . The second method , a continuous physical inventory , offsets this prob lem . Under this system a certain number of items of inventory are counted // each day or week and the perpetual inventory records adjusted accordingly . With careful planning the entire inventory can be checked with a minimum number of inventory teams and the entire job accomplished without dis rupting production . In addition to the adjustment of possible errors in the perpetual inventory the physical inventory is utilized to adjust the inventory accounts in the accounting department . This requires that the perpetual inventory be priced and extended . Again , the policy for this procedure must be established . First in ? first out , last in ? first out , average value , or some other procedure for pricing inventories must be decided upon . Once decided the policy must generally be adhered to ? it can not be changed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organization of the personnel required for the control of inventories in a manufacturing plant depend upon the system and pro cedure to be employed . It is only when the design of the inventory control system is completed that material management can plan the organization . Sound organizational principles rather than any standard pattern should be followed in setting up an inventory management and control organi230 INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL zation . Organization is a tool of management and not an end unto itself ; it should be tailored to the circumstances and problems of the individual manufacturing enterprise . Once the organization of the group is determined , the placement of the group in the overall manufacturing organization is a function of the import ance of inventory management and control to the overall efficiency of the activity . We have already indicated how these functions may be grouped with production control , purchasing , and traffic under a manager of material . This still leaves the decision as to whether the materials manager should report to the manager of manufacturing or to the general manager . In Figures 12-8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may be effective . // Future Trends in Inventory Management and Control We have already mentioned some of the future trends in inventory management and control . Summarizing some of these and bringing them into focus , it is apparent that a more scientific approach to this problem is being developed . First , the importance of establishing optimum inventories is becoming more evident . These values can be approached through the techniques of operations research . Second , more attention is being given to the simplification of inventory control procedures . This in reality is simply another facet of work simplification . Lastly , once work has been simplified , the elimination of hand labor by the use of machine records and electronic computers is gaining rapid acceptance . QUESTIONS 1 . Under what circumstances might it be practicable to classify such items as nails , screws , paint , or glue as raw ( direct ) materials ? As supplies ( indirect materials ) ? 2 . Assume that you are operating a corner popcorn stand . How would you go about deciding how much raw material ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) you should always have on hand ? your optimum inventory of each item ? 3 . Select some product with which you are fairly familiar . Make a list of the parts or materials used in making this item and classify into : ( a ) High-value items . ( b ) Intermediate-value items . ( c ) Low-value items . What percentage of the total number of parts do you find in each classi-fication ? 4 . What are the advantages of purchasing a week 's supply of groceries at one time ? In what way is this a form of inventory management and control ? What factors affect the quantities that you purchase ? 5 . A manufacturer of small drill presses receives a rush order for two special machines . The base plate needed to build these machines is the standard base plate , K461 . On checking the raw material of this item ( K461 ) you find only 45 pieces in stock ? all are allocated to stock order 4563 . Explain what you would do . 6 .

Explain in general terms " when " an item on inventory should be reordered. 9 . One company has eliminated all storerooms as such , and instead stores all material on the factory floor near the point of usage . Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of such a system . CASE PROBLEMS Curtis Heater Company The Curtis Heater Company has been a manufacturer of water heaters for a number of years , and at present all operations are conducted in a number of small plants in the Chicago area . Recently a decision was made to build a new plant of sufficient size to house all manufacturing operations as well as company offices . Considerable time and effort has been put into the design of the new plant , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovations under consideration for the new plant is elimination of all central storage area for incoming materials . Instead , at each work area , storage space will be provided for the incoming material needed for that particular operation . For example , sheet steel for heater shells is to be stored near the machine used for cutting the plates to the correct size . The same would be true for all other materials that are used in the product line . The only central storeroom would be used for maintenance supplies as well as for tools and dies . Owing largely to differences of opinion among the executives as to the value of this system for storing materials , work has not started on construction of the new plant . Questions : 1 . What advantages can be claimed for this system ? 2 . What problems will be created by the installation of this system ? 3 . What approach should be used to resolve the problem ? The Morrell Machinery Company The Morrell Machinery Company is a producer of specialized pulverizing equipment . Almost all of its products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from small units suitable for making face powder to huge machines used to pulverize rocks . The company uses in its machines a number of bearings that are relatively expensive and that must be ordered from three to six months before the date they are needed . Because of the required lead time it has been the practice to keep a considerable inventory of bearings on hand . Under the circumstances it is almost impossible to predict future usage , but the general intent is to keep a six months ' supply of bearings on hand at all times . Despite this considerable investment in // bearings , however , it still has not prevented the delay of a number of orders as a result of an inadequate supply of the right kind of bearing for a specific job . One difficulty seems to stem from the fact that frequently , when the storeroom clerk is busy with other work , the machine assemblers help themselves to the bearings needed . The assemblers , being more interested in machine assembly than in paper work , will seldom leave requisitions for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be taken to insure that bearings will be on hand when needed ? 2 . Is there any way the investment in bearing inventory can be reduced ? CHAPTER THIRTEEN Purchasing Purchasing is one of the key functions in the success of a modern manufacturing concern . As we indicated in the preceding chapter , no inventories are created until either raw material or purchased components are bought . This is true in most industrial enterprises , the exceptions being those primary industries that draw upon our natural resources such as coal , iron ore , and crude oil . Manufacturers ' profits are affected by good purchasing practices based upon sound principles and effective purchasing procedures . It has already been pointed out that the purchase requisition is the " key to material control " that initiates the purchasing activity . Later , we will discuss in greater detail how the judicious use of this form will contribute to better operating profits . Purchasing and the Control of Material Purchasing is an important phase in the control of the flow of materials into the manufacturing plant from the vendor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased parts and raw material . In addition , the inventory of supplies is controlled by the purchasing activity . We have already pointed out the importance of having material available when required for manufacturing operations , as well as the additional costs incurred if large quantities or expensive items are received too far in advance of the required date . Control of the flow of incoming material is an important responsibility of the purchasing group . 234 // Objectives of Good Purchasing As a part of the overall material control activity , the statement of the objectives of the purchasing group will include most of the objectives of inventory management and control given in the preceding chapter . However , let us review them and then discuss these objectives from the viewpoint of the purchasing function . The primary objective is to contribute towards the profits of the manufacturing activity . Another important objective is to insure the availability of materials so that delivery schedules can be maintained , thus keeping the customer satisfied . Specific objectives that support these goals are : 1 . Procurement of the right material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality . 2 . Receipt or delivery of this material at the right place and at the right time . 3 . Purchase of the material from the right source and at the right price . In most organizations the purchasing department is not responsible for determining either what material is to be bought or its quantity and quality . Also , other manufacturing personnel may designate the time and place for delivery . However , for effective buying the purchasing group must be assigned the full responsibility and authority for the determination of the sources of supply and the price to be paid . Each of these factors will be covered in more detail when we discuss the purchasing procedure . Purchasing Procedure The complete purchasing cycle consists of the following steps : 1 . Receipt and analysis of the purchase requisition . 2 . Selection of potential sources of supply . 3 . Issuance of request for quotations . 4 . Receipt and analysis of quotations . 5 . Selection of the right source . 6 . Determination of the right price . 7 . Issuance of the purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 . Analysis of receiving reports . 10 . Analysis and approval of vendor 's invoice for payment . It will be evident aswe discuss each of these steps that in many instances // some of the steps will be bypassed . For example , when purchasing a standard item from an old and established source it is often assumed that the price and terms of purchase are right and the purchase order will be placed upon receipt of the purchase requisition . However , periodic review of such terms and prices is often warranted and may result in material savings in the cost of purchased material . Purchase requisition . Purchase requisitions ( see Figure 12-2 , page 224 ) normally originate with the inventory control group . Regardless of the type of inventory ? perpetual or bin ? a reorder point is established . When existing stock reaches this level a purchase requisition is usually prepared and forwarded to the purchasing group . Minimum basic data that should be on a purchase requisition are : 1 . Material . Specifications for this material are usually established by the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchasing department , copies may have to be procured from engineering . In any event the purchase requisition must indicate clearly just what material is wanted and the required quality . 2 . Quantity . The quantity is normally the amount that will bring the inventory back up to the maximum allowable as indicated on the inventory record . In the case of the purchase of raw material for processing , this maximum may or may not be the equivalent of the economic manufacturing lot size , Larger quantities may be purchased if the economic purchase lot is greater . We will discuss this a little later . 3 . Delivery date . Sound inventory planning will usually result in the requesting of dates of delivery that can be readily met by the vendor . However , when the date can not be met it is the responsibility of the purchasing group to notify the requisitioning group at once . 4 . Place . Clear instructions as to the location for delivery are most essential , especially in larger plants where the receiving department may be decentralized . In any event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is actually placed in the inventory where the request was initiated . Purchase requisitions should be carefully analyzed by the purchasing group to see that they are complete and understandable . In well-planned inventory control all material in purchased parts and raw material inventories will have been " accumulated " on the inventory record ; thus the current total requirement for the item will be indicated by the purchase requisition . However , for miscellaneous supplies ? particularly if not too well controlled ? the purchasing group may accumulate requisitions until an economic purchase lot or quantity has been established . Sources of supply . A purchasing group must constantly keep itself informed as to the best places to buy all items of material required . This is // no small task . Effective purchasing can not be accomplished on a status quo basis . It is true that in a going situation old established sources will in all probability be the best sources ; however , new sources should be investigated from time to time and the performance of old sources evaluated periodically . If the purchase requisition is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources a selection should be made for inquiry by use of the request for quotation . Request for quotation . The title of this form is self-explanatory ( see Figure 13-1 ) . It is sent by the purchasing group to all the selected possible sources of supply . It should be as complete as a purchase order except for the statement of the price to be paid . It is up to the vendor to submit his price ; this is his quotation . Because this form is so nearly like the purchase order form it is common practice to print in bold type across the form the statement : THIS Is NoT AN ORDER . Selection of the right source . Upon receipt of the many quotations from the vendors it then becomes the job of the purchasing group to select the right source . A comprehensive discussion of all the many factors that enter into this decision is beyond the scope of this book . Briefly , the purchasing group is interested in the reliability of the prospective source of supply . Questions such as these might well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on schedule ? Does the vendor have adequate tools and equipment , trained personnel , and finances to handle the contract ? What is the location of the vendor 's plant in relation to the purchaser 's plant ; what means of transportation are available between these two points ? These are just a few of the points that must be considered in the selection of the right source . Obviously , another major consideration is the price quoted . However , the lowest bid may not be from the best source in light of the factors mentioned above . Determination of the right price . This is a major responsibility of the purchasing group . Many factors influence what is a " right price " and again a comprehensive discussion is hardly possible . In a broad sense a right price is one that is " right " for all concerned ? the purchaser , the vendor , the buyer 's customer , and the public . Obviously , the purchaser must be able to buy material at a price that will enable him to sell his product at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Modern industry is too complex and interrelated to permit sharp buying tactics that drive prices to a level at which the supplier can not make a profit . Profits are essential to our economic system , and as such essential to the public . In addition , the buyer must consider the reliability of the vendor and in some instances be willing to pay a little more for better service in quality and delivery . The final agreed price // may or may not be the quoted price ; in some instances when all factors are considered it is conceivable that it may be higher . In any event , when the price is agreed upon the purchase order is issued . Purchase order . A purchase order ( see Figure 13-2 ) , once accepted by the vendor , constitutes a contract for the delivery of the goods in accordance // with the terms of the purchase agreement . This constitutes a legal document , and it usually contains many other terms of agreement in addition to the quantity , quality , delivery , and price . Both state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence most firms have printed purchase order forms that comply with the laws under which they operate . Once the purchase order has been placed , it i 's usually the practice to notify the requi sitioning source so that they can enter the quantity in the " on order " column of the inventory record . Follow-up and delivery . The plan for the flow of material into a manufacturing plant is established by the purchasing procedure . Deter- // urination of the actual performance and comparison and evaluation of this performance can only be accomplished by effective follow-up of purchase orders . The actual production and shipment of the purchased material and component parts are , of course , the responsibility of the vendor . It is in turn the responsibility of the purchasing group to make sure that the vendor is fulfilling these responsibilities . This assurance must be had far enough in advance of the actual specified delivery date so that corrective action can be taken when necessary to get materials into the plant as originally planned . This is usually accomplished by periodic follow-up of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship the goods on schedule . For a " tight schedule " it may also be necessary to follow the shipment or , if it is delayed , have the carrier ? that is , the railroad , trucking line , or air freight service ? trace the shipment and expedite its handling . This action is one of the most common tools of " corrective action . " However , it should be realized that increased delivery costs are often involved . Other ways in which a purchasing group can take corrective action include transferring some of the orders to other sources of supply and assisting the vendor in his production problems . Docile acceptance of delayed delivery of material shifts control from the purchaser to the vendor . Corrective action ? the final element in control ? is often necessary to avoid this condition . Receiving reports . Careful inspection of all incoming material and parts is essential to effective material control . The purchase order is the basic source of reference . Of course , it is often supplemented by engineering specifications and blueprints . The receiving report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what is actually received ; by comparing it to the purchase order variations in quantity can be determined . In passing it might be well to note that a variation in quantity is often agreed upon in the purchase contract ; that is , in large quantity production plus or minus 5 per cent is often acceptable . If the shipment is " short " it simply means that the reorder point will be reached sooner . " Over " shipments delay the placing of the next order with the vendor . Shortages in excess of the allowed limit are usually placed on a back order by the supplier . Accumulations of back orders must be watched carefully by the purchasing group . Too often they are forgotten and all of a sudden stocks start building up beyond the planned maximum . Inspection reports may be a component part of the receiving report , or they may supplement it . In any event a report on the quality of the purchased goods is necessary . Discrepancies either in quantity or quality should be called promptly to the vendor 's attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it may be a joint activity of purchasing and inspection . It is an important function of purchasing because , in addition to providing purchasing with a valid measure of vendor capabilities , it insures that proper // shipments are received . Control is effective only if quantity and quality of incoming goods are maintained . Payment of invoices . Invoices received from vendors for goods shipped should receive the approval of the purchasing group . This is the final control step in the purchasing procedure . Invoices should be checked to insure that quantities billed conform with the quantities accepted by the receiving and inspection departments . It is also good practice to check the unit prices on the invoice and the extension of these prices to the total bill . Finally all discounts and other terms of the original purchase contract should be checked against the invoice . By this final control step payment is made only for the value of goods received . Although the above description of the purchasing procedure is brief , we want to point out again that all the steps are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be reviewed often to insure that the correct steps are being included . Purchasing work simplification . The size and complexity of modern industry makes the job of purchasing correspondingly difficult . Like any other procedure , purchasing work can be analyzed , simplified , and improved by work simplification techniques . Study and the reduction of the number of forms used , as well as use of flow charts of the purchasing procedure , will not only increase the efficiency of the system but should reduce the cost of the purchasing operation . As with inventory control , the magnitude of the purchasing job and of all of the records involved is determined by the number of parts or items for which records have to be maintained . In a large company manufacturing a multi-product line of goods many thousands of separate purchase records must be maintained . Current trends are toward mechanization of these records by the use of electronic computers and similar devices . Value Analysis Although value analysis has been discussed in the methods engineering chapter , it requires further amplification here inasmuch as the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purchasing activity . The basic idea of value analysis is simply that of a cost-reduction technique , and as such it might logically be treated as a part of methods engineering and of purchasing simplification as discussed in the previous section . However , as it is frequently used , purchasing people have a very definite role to play ; so perhaps it is logical for value analysis to be under their general direction . The objective of value analysis is to get more value from an item in // terms of function . This can and should be done whether the item is manufactured within the plant or purchased from the outside . Outside purchases make it relatively easy to evaluate savings since there is often a difference in quoted prices for the items , and the difference is a real savings to the company . The General Electric Company pioneered value analysis work , and we cite one or two of their experiences to illustrate what is meant by this process . One of their parts was a push button that had been made as a screw machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be cold-headed from aluminum wire . Cost of the item dropped from nineteen cents to two cents . Another part was a steel " J " bolt with threads on the long end . The drawing simply said , " cut thread . " A rolled thread specialist studied the part and suggested that the words " cut thread " be removed from the drawing , thereby making it possible to roll the thread . This was done and the part could then be purchased at 1.5 cents as compared to 11.7 cents formerly . The company saved eighty thousand dollars . In both of the cases cited the function of the part remained the same , and the new part could perform this function as well as the old . The difference was the tremendous savings in cost of purchase ; hence value of the parts increased enormously . Value Analysis Approaches A number of approaches have been suggested and used to facilitate the development of value analysis , and many of these approaches have been used in methods work for years . The reader is reminded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be applied to parts produced by the plant as well as to those purchased for the plant . Asking questions is probably the simplest and most effective approach . The General Electric Company has worked out ten particular questions they feel are of value in analysis work , and they submit each part to the ten questions . Typical questions are : Does it contribute value ? Does it need all of its features ? Can a standard product be found that will be usable ? If a part fails any of these questions the analyst makes a more detailed investigation . However , much depends upon the knowledge and ability of the analyst , and a part may not fail one of the test questions until after the analyst has thought of another possible solution to the function being performed by the part in question . Frequently , a lucrative source of cost reduction can be found by asking questions of designers and others who may indicate specifications on blueprints and on bills of material . Designers who specify tolerances for a part much closer than those actually required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in either obtaining the quality specified or in // purchasing that quality . The " J " bolt example mentioned earlier is a case in point . The designer most likely indicated " cut thread " for this part because he was unaware of any other way to produce the thread . Making a comparative analysis is another approach used by value analysts . Investigation of all similar type parts purchased by the company might reveal some opportunities to cut costs of some of those parts . One analyst reviewed all the die castings purchased by his company and obtained clues as to how expensive features might be eliminated on some of the castings . Some analysts plot the weight of similar parts purchased against their cost per pound . If most parts seem to fall on a smooth line , but a few parts fall away from the line , these few might present opportunities for special investigation . Supplier contacts are a technique of value analysis that may be of considerable value to the purchasing department . Any alert purchasing group is constantly looking for improvement and cost-reduction ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , likewise , suppliers are normally quick to make suggestions to their customers as to how they can save money . Some companies , however , have arranged supplier seminars to which they invite representatives from all their main suppliers and show special product displays in which every detailed part of their product is spread out on a table or attached to a display board . Suggestions for improvements are solicited from the supplier even if the supplier does not make the part in question . The point is that undoubtedly the supplier knows more about his particular specialty than any of his customers do , and therefore would constitute a valuable source of cost-reduction ideas . Standardization is another approach of value analysis although standardization , as such , has been employed by industry for many years . To the extent that a value analysis of various parts and components suggests the possibility of standardization when it has been overlooked previously , value analysis must be given credit . One company reviewed 1447 items in its stock and found it could eliminate 794 of them through standardization . The savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis programs are designed to reduce the cost of an item , but standardization programs may eliminate the item entirely . Certainly , costs can not be reduced any lower than that ! Factors Affecting Purchasing In the following sections we will attempt to list the many factors that influence both purchasing practices and the results of the work of the purchasing group . // Requisitioning authority . No purchases should be made without a properly signed purchase requisition . The first and most important step in the control of material is control of the authority to sign purchase requisitions . If " every Tom , Dick , and Harry " can requisition material , then the control of material is to all practical purposes lost before it starts . Authority to sign purchase requisitions should be limited to as few individuals as possible . In turn , within this group there may be limitations as to the type or value of the requisition that can be signed . In an office one of the stenographers might be authorized to requisition all office supplies to a monthly limit of $250 total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine probably would require the signature of a member of top management . Type of manufacture . The type of manufacture influences the purchasing activity . Continuous manufacturing industries such as those that produce radios and automobiles normally operate extensive assembly lines . Material is scheduled to these lines with a minimum of stock inventory , and the majority of the control of material becomes the responsibility of the purchasing group . Also in this case there is a tendency to have a higher dollar content of purchased parts in the product . On the other hand , in an intermittent custom building situation the dollar content of purchased parts may be low ; thus raw materials are the principal problem of the purchasing group . There is more flexibility in schedules for incoming material . However , for large machine tools and heavy apparatus delivery of major items is scheduled closely . Subcontracting . Items purchased on subcontracts are actually purchased parts or components . However , subcontracting generally takes place when it is not possible to produce the parts in the local plant . In the placing of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purchaser . Care must be , exercised to insure that a valid comparison is made between the price quoted and the local manufacturing cost . Close cooperation between product engineering , manufacturing , and purchasing is prerequisite to a successful subcontracting program . Standardization of product . In the chapter on manufacturing processes we discussed the advantages of the standardization of products and their component parts . Often it is overlooked that suppliers also attempt to standardize the items that they sell . One of the principal activities of the purchasing group is to encourage the inclusion of vendors ' standards in the product design of the purchaser 's product . Material and labor costs can often be reduced by the purchase of standard sizes of items such as cold rolled bar steel , if the product designer accepts the finished surfaces and dimensions of the raw material as the finished specifications of the product that he is // designing . This is only one example of the type of savings that can be effected through standardization . Another approach to standardization for the purchasing group is to analyze the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nails ) and request a reduction in the number of sizes required . Minor product-design changes can often be made to accomplish this end . Economic purchase lot . Earlier , we mentioned the economic purchase lot . It is similar to the economic manufacturing lot that has been discussed in the chapter on manufacturing processes ; only the cost factors are different . Larger quantities of goods can usually be purchased for lower unit costs . These savings must be balanced against the increased costs for the carrying charges , the same as in the manufacturing lot . In manufacturing we saved in setup costs ; here we save in the cost of preparing the purchase order and on all the other steps in the purchasing procedure . Owing to the cost factors involved , it is easier to calculate economic purchase lot quantities . Short and controlled markets . We have already said that purchasing people have to know where to buy the required items of material . Even if we know the purchasing source , it is not always easy to buy . Some markets are " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material to meet the demand . Other markets are " controlled " ; material is available but total sales are restricted . This is particularly true in times of war ; material is allocated to industries , and many items are virtually non-available for the production of civilian goods . Both of these situations present real problems to purchasing . Cancellations . Cancellation of purchase orders can not , be totally avoided . If work has been started by the vendor , or he has made other commitments on the strength of the order , he may lose considerable money . It is the problem of the purchasing group to keep this loss at a minimum . Most purchase orders have standard clauses covering the liability of the purchaser as well as the supplier . Close cooperation between marketing , engineering , manufacturing , and purchasing is required to anticipate a situation that may result in order cancellations . The sooner purchasing knows of such a possibility , the better are the chances for making the cancellation with a minimum cost to all involved . Trade relations . Modern industry is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vendors who in turn buy back their material in the form of the purchaser 's product . This is termed reciprocal buying . Too often this presents a real problem to the purchasing group . Vendors who are also customers may expect advantages in price , terms , or by other means . This detracts from the possibility of arriving at a " right " price . The maintenance of good trade relations under these situations is a real test of // a good purchasing group . To be able to give the business to another source and still retain the goodwill of the customer-supplier is the objective of trade relations . Purchasing Organization The law of agency . Purchase orders and contracts are signed by individuals each of whom acts as an agent of the company or corporation . As agents they have been given either specific or implied authority to act for their employer in the purchase of material , supplies , and services , or in any other type of agreement constituting a purchase . As a consequence the individual is known as a purchasing agent . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation , the authority is probably specific ; however , as the position is usually appointive , most purchasing agents have implied authority . In either event they act for the concern in the procurement of the necessary material and services . Organization structure . There is no set pattern of purchasing organization . The same sound principles of organization apply to purchasing as to all the other functions in the manufacturing enterprise . The position of the purchasing group in the overall organization is largely dependent on the importance of the function . As we have already indicated , in cases where a large portion of the manufacturing dollar is represented by purchased material the senior purchasing agent may have vice-presidential status ? and a large purchasing organization to perform the purchasing activities . In a small operation , on the other hand , we may find a single purchasing agent handling all the duties and reporting to anyone from the shop superintendent to the owner of the enterprise . Centralization and decentralization . In large organizations  --  particularly in multi-plant industries ? there is a problem of centralization or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages and disadvantages of each is beyond the scope of this book . However , decentralized operations are more flexible , and the trend toward increased decentralization of large corporations indicates that this method of organization is currently the most popular . Major purchase contracts for principal materials may be retained on a centralized basis to gain bargaining advantage . Purchasing group . The purchasing group in larger organizations usually consists of several purchasing agents , buyers , expediters , and the necessary clerical and stenographic personnel . Organization of this group may be on the basis of product line or purchased material . If the latter , one agent may specialize in the purchase of steel , another in plastics , another in supplies , and so on , the entire organization being developed along these lines . In a multi-product manufacturing plant the purchasen , ut. ++ ? gar , .. , , may be divided so that certain groups do all the buying for a spei , In tarrrtu , + and other groups for the other products . Regardless of the basis of the organization pattern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedure and in clear-cut under-standing by all personnel of their duties and responsibilities . Purchasing Practices It might be well to discuss a few of the many practices of modern purchasing . Salesmen relations . Both purchasing and selling are rapidly gaining professional recognition . The continuing technological advance in both materials and processes requires that purchasing and sales personnel be more than " glad-hand artists " ? they have to know what they are selling and what they are buying . " Sharp trading " is no longer accepted practice . As we indicated earlier in the chapter , purchases should be made at the right price ; this can be done only if the buyer and the seller each respect the knowledge and integrity of the other . Courteous treatment of the salesman is prerequi-site to modern purchasing practice . Unnecessary waiting can be avoided by giving appointments . It should always be remembered by the buyer that the salesman is one of his principal sources of current information as to mar-kets , products , processes , and all developments in the field in which they are both interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trade and quantity discounts . Purchasing agents and buyers must be thoroughly acquainted with these discounts as they apply to the purchases that they are making ? and with the legal aspects of same . To promote fair trade , free from restraint and undue favoritism , laws such as the Robinson-Patman Act , Sherman Act , and Clayton Act must be common knowledge of purchas ing personnel , and their regulations must be observed . However , by the use of discounts within the legal limitations the buyer can effect substantia savings in money expended for material and services . Quantity discounts are allowed for the purchase of increased quantities of goods and are the deter mining factor in the establishment of economic purchase lots . Cash discount are made for prompt payment of invoices ; of late , however , it is often the practice to make an additional charge for lack of prompt payment . Trade discounts are applied to material that has a fixed list price , the discount being allowed to the trade or related activity of the purchaser . Multiple sources . It seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basket . " Where large quantities are involved , a good purchasing practice is to develop more than one source of supply and divide requirements between // these sources . This takes considerable tact on the part of ' the buyer but insures against the loss of delivery that may result from lire , flood , labor troubles , or other causes that may interfere with the production of a single source of supply . Forward buying . Although quantities to be purchased are normally determined by inventory management and control , it is often advantageous to purchase quantities in excess of the normal operating requirements of the manufacturing plant . If operational considerations or supply conditions indicate the need for such an inventory reserve , these purchases are termed forward buying . Forward buying is done to build up a reserve stock and thereby avoid possible shutdowns , to increase purchase quantities and thereby take advantage of quantity discounts , to purchase in economical transportation units such as a carload or shipload , to protect against risk of material shortages , and in a short market to insure the procurement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires good judgment on the part of the purchasing agent and management . Speculative buying . This is not forward buying . In speculative buying materials are bought and held for resale , the hope being to gain the advantage of a rise in prices . Gifts . A real problem to the purchasing organization is the practice of vendors of making gifts to purchasing personnel , particularly at Christmas . Although such gifts are not intended as bribes , it is hardly realistic to assume that they will not influence the considerations of the buyer . Many concerns now prohibit their buyers from accepting such gifts . Good purchasing practice , of course , would not consider the acceptance of favors a valid reason for deciding where to buy . Purchasing Research Purchasing research can be in three areas . We have already mentioned the accumulation of purchasing records by the purchasing group . Study of these records , catalogues , trade directories , and journals , and attendance at trade shows and conventions will yield extensive knowledge both as to material available and the best sources for the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two areas of purchasing research is to make available current and complete information as to ( 1 ) sources of supply , and ( 2 ) latest developments in material , equipment , and services . Full utilization of this information requires close communication with all the other functions in the organization ; the product engineer is interested in material , the manu- // facturing engineer in processes and equipment , and others in material , equipment , and services as they affect their operations . The third area of purchasing research involves procedures for more effective purchasing : better records and systems , better communications ? not only with vendors but within the local organization ? and other ways to do a better job of buying at less cost including the development of value analysis . Evaluation of Purchasing As an overall activity it is difficult to make a valid evaluation of the purchasing activity . General measures such as the ratio of the cost of purchasing to the value of material purchased , or to the value of sales , may provide a useful index within a given organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more specific objectives of the purchasing group : is the right material of the right quality and in the right quantity being procured from the right source at the right price and delivered at the right place and at the right time ? Continuous rating of the accomplishment of these objectives will indicate the success of the function if not the total efficiency . Insofar as these objectives might be accomplished at excessive cost by the purchasing organization it might be well to consider the ratio of purchasing costs to the profits of the concern ? but again so many other factors affect these profits that a valid measurement is highly doubtful . Continued research in the field of purchasing will no doubt result in effective ways of measuring this principal activity in the control of material in manufacturing . Traffic Because it is normally the prerogative of the purchaser to designate the route and method of shipment of material , in smaller manufacturing operations the function of traffic management is included in the purchasing operation . However , in larger companies traffic departments are charged with traffic responsibilities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for incoming material , including the selection of the method of transportation . 2 . Preparation of rate charts for delivery of material . 3 . Tracing of shipments to insure prompt delivery . 4 . Auditing and approval of incoming freight and other transportation bills . // 5 . Coordinating the receipt of large shipments to avoid demurrage charges . 6 . Handling the adjustment of claims for goods damaged or lost in transit . Traffic functions need not be restricted to incoming material . In many instances manufacturers accept the responsibility for delivery of their product to the customer . It is interesting to note that one of the first steps in the design of a large steam turbine generator unit is careful planning of the route of shipment . Traffic restrictions along the route , such as the dimensions of an underpass , often must be taken into consideration in the initial design stages . In such cases as these , traffic works closely with sales , engineering , and any other functions of the organization concerned with the delivery of the product to the customer .

The maintenance department of Midway Products sent a purchase requisition to the purchasing department for 75 heavy-duty push brooms . The purchasing // department asked for quotations from three distributors and received the fol lowing bids : Questions : Assuming the quality is the same for all three , with which distributor should the purchasing department place the order ? Would your answer have been the same if the item had been bearings for a special production order , rather than brooms ? Explain . Bassett Soap Company The Bassett Soap Company manufactures and sells soap powders for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packing processes a quantity of fine dust is created ; this dust is removed by means of a vacuum dust collecting system . Inserted in the air stream for the purpose of trapping the fine dust particles are filters composed of several hundred cotton bags . If any of the filter bags break , dust is blown into the atmosphere ; the result is a loss of soap as well as an annoyance to the community surrounding the plant . Over the years , plant personnel have learned that the bags last for a little over a year , after which small holes begin to appear . It has therefore been the regular practice of the plant to install a complete new set of filter bags each year during the two-week vacation shutdown . The plant regularly placed a purchase requisition for the replacement bags about 3 months ahead of the scheduled shutdown , and the same quality of bag from the same supplier had been ordered and used for a number of years . To fill the last requisition , however , the purchasing department placed the order with another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second supplier that their bag possessed the same quality characteristics but cost 22 cents less per bag . The new bags were installed as usual during the last shutdown . Two weeks later some of the new bags began leaking dust as the result of holes that had devel oped . Four weeks later an emergency order was placed with the former supplier for a whole new set of bags , and a crew of six men was brought in on a week end at overtime rates to install the new set of filter bags . Questions : What was wrong with the procedure followed by the purchasing department ? What should they have done ? Should the plant personnel have accepted the substitute bags since they were not what had been specified on the requisition ? What are the extra costs involved as a result of the incident ? Who should be charged with these extra costs ? CHAPTER FOURTEEN Production Planning and Control In the preceding chapters we have discussed the control of static inventories ? raw material , purchased parts , finished goods , and supplies ? by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the flow of materials into the plant was covered in the chapter on purchasing . Production planning and control is concerned with the control of the work-in-process . Inventory management and control , as well as purchasing , are controls of material . The scope of production planning and control is broader . To control work-in-process effectively it becomes necessary to control not only the flow of material but also the utilization of men and machines . Production Planning and Control Functions All of the four basic phases of control of manufacture are easily indentified in production planning and control . The plan for the processing of materials through the plant is established by the functions of routing , loading , and scheduling . The function of dispatching puts the plan into effect ; that is , operations are started in accordance with the plan . Actual performance is observed and recorded by the function of reporting or follow-up . Actual performance is then compared to the planned performance and , when required , corrective action is taken . In some instances replanning is necessary to insure the effective utilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more closely each of these functions . 252 // Routing . The determination of where each operation on a component part , subassembly , or assembly is to be performed results in a route for the movement of a manufacturing lot through the factory . Prior determination of these routes is the job of the routing function . Routing may be generalized or detailed . In a large manufacturing works area a general route may be established by buildings . More commonly it is established by departments , such as machine shop , assembly , finishing , inspection , or others . Detailed routing would indicate the specific work station or machine to be used for each operation . Regardless of the detail in which the routing is initially planned , a precisely detailed route eventually has to be determined . For example , if a lot of parts is routed to the machine shop for processing , and there are three separate operations to be performed in that department , the decision by the foreman or dispatcher as to the three machines to be used for the job determines the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop . However , this is too often a lastminute decision , depending only on the availability of the machines instead of being guided to an effective degree by planning . On the other hand , in continuous manufacturing when a processing line of machines is used , or an assembly line is installed , the route of the materials must conform to the line ; the routing function was incorporated in and accomplished by the original layout of the plant . The source of basic information for the routing function is the standard process sheet , which indicates the type of machine or work station required for each operation in the process . Loading . Once the route has been established , the work required can be loaded against the selected machine or work station . The total time required to perform the operation is computed by multiplying the unit operation times given on the standard process sheet by the number of parts to be processed . This total time is then added to the work already planned for the work station . This is the function of loading and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilization of the machines or work stations in the plant . One of the problems in loading is the amount of utilization that can be planned for a given workshift , such as an 8-hour day . For example , owing to factors such as maintenance , repair , setup , and others , 85 per cent utilization is considered a good average for machine tools . Under these conditions only 6.8 hours of productive work should be loaded for an 8-hour shift . But if workers can be expected to earn an average of 20 per cent bonus ? and the 6.8 hours is based on standard times ? a total of 8.16 standard hours can be loaded against an 8-hour shift . Thus far we have indicated that loading is by work station or machine . This is detailed loading . Loading may be generalized , like routing ; that is , groups of machines or departments may be loaded as a single unit . For // example , all lathe work may be loaded against the lathe department , or all milling to be done simply charged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective of the loading function is to maintain an up-to-date picture of the available capacity in the plant . If a general type of loading is adequate this should be used and no further breakdown of loads made . Often it is sufficient to keep load charts on only the critical productive units or departments and assume that all other departments have adequate capacity to keep abreast of the production rate . Obviously load charts would be referred to when determining routes of orders through an intermittent manufacturing plant . In this case the route is influenced by the availability of a department , machine group , or workstation capacity . Scheduling . Scheduling is the last of the planning functions . This function determines when an operation is to be performed , or when work is to be completed ; the difference lies in the detail of the scheduling procedure . In a centralized control situation ? where all routing , loading , and scheduling for the plant is done in a central office ? the detail of the schedule may specify the starting and finishing time for an operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply give a completion time for the work in a given department ( as in the machine-department situation mentioned above ) . Here the foreman would be held responsible for having all three operations completed by a given date . The detailed schedule for the completion of each of the three operations in the machine department would have to be determined by the foreman or the dispatcher . Again , this is more than likely to be an after-the-fact determination rather than sound planning . However , as with routing , all general schedules eventually become detailed schedules . Prior determination of when work is to be done is the function of scheduling . Combining functions . While it is easy to define " where " as routing , " how much work " as loading , and " when " as scheduling , in actual operations these three functions are often combined and performed concurrently . How far in advance routes , loads , and schedules should be established always presents an interesting problem . Obviously , it is desirable that a minimum of changes be made after schedules are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work scheduled for the factory or department is equal to or slightly greater than the manufacturing cycle . For optimum control it should never be less than the manufacturing cycle . If it normally takes three days for work to pass through a department , the work load should never be scheduled less than three days in advance . The total work load ahead of the department might be three or six months . Obviously , scheduling all of the work load in advance would not be necessary // for the effective day-to-day operation and would present a problem if changes in schedule were necessary . Scheduling too far in advance of operating requirements introduces a degree of inflexibility in the control of production . Load charts may be maintained in addition to the schedule charts showing the total load ahead . This is justified only if it is necessary to identify critical shortages of productive capacity in advance of the normal scheduling procedure . Work can be loaded against a work station or department without being scheduled ? but it can not be scheduled without being loaded . Dispatching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor is the function of dispatching . This function may be centralized or decentralized . Again using our machine-shop example , the departmental dispatcher would authorize the start of each of the three machine operations ? three dispatch actions based upon the foreman 's routing and scheduling of the work through his department . This is decentralized dispatching . Another case of decentralized dispatching would be where the departmental dispatcher dispatched work based upon plans of a central control office , advising them only when the work had been started . In a centralized dispatch situation , when a job had been completed on a machine or at a work station the departmental dispatcher would call a central dispatcher and ask what job should now be started ; the actual assignment of work thus would remain at a central point . Reporting or follow-up . The manufacturing activity of a plant is said to be " in control " when the actual performance is within the objectives of the planned performance . When jobs are started and completed on schedule there should be very little , if any , concern about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is attained only if the original plan has been carefully prepared to utilize the manufacturing facilities fully and effectively . The effectiveness of any production control system is dependent upon timely and adequate information regarding actual performance . This basic information normally originates with the dispatcher . Although the reporting of jobs completed is important , it is of even greater importance that delays in production be anticipated and work that is lagging behind the anticipated production rate be reported promptly to the production planning and control function . A good production control procedure makes this reporting , and a system of counter-checks by follow-up , automatic . The system by its very procedures will call attention immediately to danger points in the manufacturing activity . Effective corrective action is based upon these reports . Realistically , some jobs will always be running behind schedule ? others may be ahead of // schedule . Careful analysis of the situation may indicate how a few changes can bring the late work back on schedule by using productive capacity made available by the jobs that are running ahead of schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production planning and control activity . A plant in which all manufacturing activity runs on schedule in all probability is not being scheduled to its optimum productive capacity . With an optimum schedule , manufacturing delays are the rule , not the exception . However , if these delays are accepted without concern and schedules revised , then the actual output of the plant , not the management , is controlling the production . It is by corrective action that management maintains full control . Means are found to get the work back on the original schedule . Jobs are shifted to other machines or work stations , overtime is authorized , and extra help is put on the job . There are many ways in which production emergencies can be met . Replanning . Replanning is not corrective action . Replanning revises routes , loads , and schedules ; a new plan is developed . In manufacturing this is often required . Changes in market conditions , manufacturing methods , or many other factors affecting the plant will often indicate that a new manufacturing plan is needed . In summation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the route of work through the plant , determines the amount of productive capacity required to do the work , and ? based upon the availability of this capacity ? schedules all phases of the work so that the plant will be effectively utilized . Once these plans are established , production control provides the means to keep track of manufacturing activity and when necessary take corrective action or replan . It is simple : " Make your plan , then work your plan ! " We have discussed each of the production planning and control functions , emphasizing that their application in manufacturing is not uniform . However , it should be remembered that at no time can any function be eliminated . Routing , loading , scheduling , dispatching , reporting , and corrective action are component parts of any effectively managed manufacturing operation . This is just as true of a streetcorner popcorn stand operated by one man as it is of a large concern employing many thousands and producing a wide line of products . Production planning and control of itself is a simple procedure ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Decisions must be made as to the degree of control necessary , centralization or decentralization of the production control procedures , and when the various functions are to be performed . Let us now discuss some of the factors that affect the application of production planning and control procedures and techniques . // Factors Affecting Production Planning and Control The factors that affect the application of production planning and control to manufacturing are the same as the factors we have already discussed as affecting inventory management and control . Let us briefly review these in relation to production planning and control . Type of product . Again , it is the complexity of the product that is important , not what the product is , except as this may in turn relate to the market being served . Production control procedures are much more com-plex and involve many more records when manufacturing large steam turbine generator sets or locomotives to customer orders than when producing large quantities of a standard product involving only a few component parts , such as electric blankets , steam irons , or similar small appliances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served . A seasonal market may require careful planning of production for maximum output during a limited period of time ( this is particularly true in the canning industry ) . On the other hand , a seasonal market in rubbers and overshoes may be offest by planning to manufacture to stock during the slack seasons . Manu-facturing to stock , as opposed to producing only to the customer order , presents an entirely different situation . Type of manufacturing . This is probably the most important influenc-ing factor in the control situation . For a large continuous manufacturing plant producing a standard product we have already indicated that the rout-ing was included in the planning of the plant layout . Also the detailed scheduling of work between operations was accomplished when the many production lines were balanced . As a result , about all that is left for the function of production planning and control in the operation of the plant is to set up key control points in the lines and , once manufacturing is started , to make sure that all the many feeder lines are producing adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partially completed component parts or subassemblies . As we have mentioned previously , this situation is for all practical purposes a control of materials at the start of the lines . Intermittent manufacture of multi-product lines presents a quite dif-ferent problem . Optimum operation of the factory is dependent upon the effective use of all of the functions of production planning and control . All production planning and control functions occur after the manufacturing order is approved ; this can not be avoided . Depending upon the degree of control desired , the length of the manufacturing cycle , and the decentral-ization or centralization of control wanted , a production planning and control // system must be developed that will result in the optimum operation of the intermittent plant . Once more , the volume produced , or the size of the factory , is not a factor directly affecting the problem of the design of the control system . Objectives of Production Planning and Control The ultimate objective of production planning and control , like that of all other manufacturing controls , is to contribute to the profits of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished by keeping the customers satisfied through the meeting of delivery schedules . Specific objectives of production planning and control are to establish routes and schedules for work that will insure the optimum utilization of materials , men , and machines and to provide the means for insuring the operation of the plant in accordance with these plans . Production Planning and Control Procedures A detailed discussion of all the techniques and procedures of production planning and control is beyond the scope of this text . We have already indicated that these practices will vary widely from plant to plant . Further , the many ways in which each of the functions might be carried out in practice were indicated earlier in this chapter . It might be well , however , to point out again that any production planning and control procedure should meet the bench marks of good control practice that were outlined in Chapter 11 on manufacturing controls . Though no production control function can be entirely eliminated , the least control that results in effective operation of the factory is the best control . It must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of management . The objective is not an elaborate and detailed system of controls and records ; the objective is the optimum operation of the plant for maximum profits . Production Planning and Control Systems Because production planning and control is the control of the work-inprocess , the . system will in effect tie together all previous records and forms developed in all planning for the manufacture of the product . In like manner // this activity brings together all the other functions of the enterprise ? marketing , engineering , personnel administration , finance , and manufacturing . Later in our brief discussion of organization we will point out that the production planning and control group is most generally a subgroup of the manufacturing function . Basically , production planning and control systems are industrial communications established to insure proper relationship between market forecasts , customers ' orders , manufacturing capacity and rates of production , and shipments . Let us take a quick look at some of the records or forms that enter into the consideration of the production planning and control group in the performance of their duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to be sources of basic data ? of information that is needed by production planning and control for the effective use of its own records and forms . Market forecast . The market forecast will be discussed in the chapter on marketing . Its value to production planning and control is that it will indicate future trends in manufacturing requirements . Workshift policies , plans for increase or decrease of manufacturing activity , or possible plant expansions may often be based upon the market forecasts , and in turn affect the planning of the production planning and control group . Customer order . These are received initially by the sales department . This is the first of five types of orders involved in a manufacturing situation . Although there is no uniform terminology for all five of these classes of orders , each can be readily identified by what is ordered or authorized by the form . By a customer 's order we mean an agreement to purchase the product ; this becomes a legal contract once the order is accepted by the manufacturer . It is really the customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders are usually forwarded to production planning for confirmation of the delivery date requested by the customer . This delivery date ? or shipping date ? must be carefully considered and agreed upon , often without an analysis of the order and its integration into load or schedule charts . If the request for delivery can not be met , the matter should be promptly referred back to the sales group for further discussion with the customer before accepting the order . Sales order . This is the second of the five classes of orders . It is a rewrite of the customer 's order specifying what he has purchased ? product and quantity ? and authorizing shipment of the goods to the customer . Multiple copies are prepared and all interested functions are furnished a copy . Sales orders may be written by marketing , inventory control , or // production control . In any event they are processed through the finished goods inventory ( if one is maintained ) . In a custom manufacturing situation these orders are the base upon which all activity in preparation for manufacture is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the shipping department will use this order as a requisition to draw the products from finished goods and to package and ship the order . In other cases these orders are accumulated until economical manufacturing lots are on order and a stock order placed with the plant to manufacture the goods , shipment then being made as the material is received in the shipping department . In all cases , however , the production planning and control group must use these orders as the basic data for the shipping promises to which they are committed . Stock order . This third class of order is not always used . In the preceding paragraph we indicated how it may be used after sales orders accumulate to an economical manufacturing lot . It is , of course , the principal order when manufacturing to stock . It will authorize production in anticipation of future sales . It may be issued by inventory control , or by marketing , but should always be confirmed by the marketing function to insure that surpluses of products are not made that will result in loss owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production planning and control group will determine a completion date for stock orders and from this file will keep track of the dates for which they have commitments . Shop order . This fourth class of order deals with the manufacture of component parts . Customer orders , sales orders , and stock orders are for the finished product . In the preceding chapters we discussed how by product explosion the requirements are established for component parts to build assembled products . Based upon the shortages that appear in the component parts inventory , shop orders are prepared by inventory control . This order ( see Figure 12-3 , page 225 ) , when passed on to the production planning and control group , becomes the basis for the majority of routing , loading , and scheduling . Standard process sheet . This form , which is prepared by process engineering , has been discussed in detail in Chapter 5 . Also , in discussing the function of routing we pointed out that this is the source of basic data as to the type of machine to be used , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the manufacture of the product . Routing and scheduling of shop orders , as well as loading of work stations in advance of scheduling , depend upon up-to-date standard process sheets being available to the production planning and control group . Engineering specifications . Blueprints and bills of materials are used by production planning and control when they become a component part of the packaged instructions issued to the shop through the control office . // One good planning procedure is to accumulate all necessary data for a shop order in a single package ? the standard process sheet , the blueprint , the bill of material ( if an assembly operation is involved ) , the route sheet , and possibly the schedule for the production of the order . This complete package is then held pending the dispatching of the work to the shop . This completes a brief review of the basic-data forms used by production planning and control . The following forms and records are prepared by the production planning and control group . Route sheet . This is the form upon which the route of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generally combined with one of the other forms in the system . For example , the shop order , the standard process sheet , and the route sheet are often one piece of paper ? and usually called the shop order or the manufacturing order ( see Figure 14-1 ) . Load charts . These are prepared to show the productive capacity that has been " sold " ? and at the same time the available productive capacity ( see Figure 14-2 ) . As we pointed out when discussing the function of loading , these charts may be prepared for each workstation or machine in the plant ; // or they may be for groups of machines or departments . One large manufacturer of heavy apparatus actually loads the entire plant , using as his scale the kilowatt capacity of the equipment he is producing . Load charts , as such , are not too common . This function is usually combined with scheduling , and only one set of charts is maintained : the schedule charts . Schedule charts . Schedule charts are prepared to show the planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or machines in the plant . These charts not only show what work is ahead of each pro ductive unit , but also when it is planned that the work shall be done . They are usually a graphical representation  --  such as the Gantt charts shown in Figures 14-3 to 14-6 . In discussing scheduling we pointed out that " firm " schedules ( schedules not subject to change ) should never be less than the manufacturing cycle , and for flexibility should not be too much greater than this period of time . A usual solution is to prepare these schedule charts for a three-months period , the first month on the chart being a firm schedule , the last two months being tentative . In a large shop it becomes quite a problem to transmit schedule infor mation to the many departments involved . We have indicated that it might be included in the shop order package . This solution has the disadvantage that if changes in schedules have to be made there is a lot of paper floating around the shop that has to be located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the portion of the schedule chart that applies to that manufacturing unit . Finally , the schedule clerk might draw off the chart a job priority list for each unit or work station and furnish only these lists to the shop ; this has the disadvantage that the departmental dispatcher will not be as apt to anticipate work running behind schedule . Another problem in schedule charts is the matter of keeping them up to date . At least , it is often believed to be a problem . But if we accept the concept that schedules once firm should not be changed , then the incomplete work indicated on the chart will show us a true " late " condition of our manuPRODUCTION // facturing activity . By so doing this chart will be most valuable in the planning for corrective action . Once an order is late it should remain late until brought back to the original planned schedule . Job tickets . This is the fifth and last type of order in a manufacturing situation . Job tickets ( see Figure 14-7 ) authorize the performance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pre-written by the production control group or made out by the departmental dispatcher when needed is not of great importance . However , this is probably one of the most important forms in the production control system . initially it simply authorizes that a particular operation is to be performed . However , when finally filled out upon the completion of the operation it becomes the " feedback " form that shows not only that the job is complete but also the number of parts processed and the actual time required . This is the principal form in the reporting and follow-up steps in the control of production . Again , let us remember that there is no uniform terminology for the forms we have just discussed . However , if we get a clear understanding of what each form is being used for in the control situation , we can readily iden tify these forms in a manufacturing plant regardless of what title appears at the top of the sheet or card . Project Planning Methods Although the Gantt chart , as shown in Figures 14-3 to 14-6 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scheduling , and control device , weak nesses developed when it came to the planning of long-term complex projects . // Through investigating an area known as network analysis appropriate methods were discovered that would permit optimal or near optimal sequencing and utilization of resources . The best-known methods that have been developed are CPM ( for critical path methods ) and PERT ( for Program Evaluation and Review Technique ) . The original PERT technique is now considered , more accurately , PERT TIME , whereas a later development is known as PERT COST . PERT was developed in 1958 by the U.S. Navy Special Projects Office in conjunction with the consulting firm of Booz , Allen , and Hamilton . The Navy 's interest at the time was to accelerate the Polaris missile and submarine project , and through the use of the PERT technique they were able to complete the project two years ahead of schedule with a savings of millions of dollars . PERT and PERT COST are becoming almost standard procedures for companies dealing with large development projects , particularly those that have contracts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration . CPM was developed by the DuPont Company and Remington Rand at about the same time as PERT . Its purpose at the time was to plan the construction of a plant , and CPM is used extensively by construction people today although it lends itself very well to other types of projects also . The use of these tools requires first of all that all elements , steps , activities , jobs , and so forth , that are required for a project be completely identified and detailed . Further , a sequencing order must be determined , which is based upon any technological or administrative dependencies of one part of the project upon another . Finally , the time and cost to perform each task or activity must also be estimated . At this point one is prepared to construct a network or an arrow diagram that illustrates the information collected . Figure 14-8 illustrates such a diagram for a simple project . On the diagram each arrow represents a single activity , and each circle represents an event . An event is the completion of one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can begin only after all activities(arrows) terminating at that circle have been completed . In this way precedents for the various activities are indicated . Events are differentiated by numbers within the event circles , and each event should have a higher number than the immediately preceding event , and no two events should have the same number . Figure 14-8 makes use of letters to identify the arrows . In practice the letters would be replaced by word descriptions of the particular activities involved . This would be true particularly when initially setting up the project and identifying all of the various steps and their precedents . After all activities have been identified and time estimates made for the completion of these activities , a new diagram is constructed in which the letters , shown in Figure 14-8 , are replaced by the time estimates for completion . With this information it becomes clear that there would be one path through the network that would be longer than all of the other paths . Such a path is called a " critical path " because if any job or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corresponding delay in the completion time for the entire project . In many situations , of course , it is difficult to estimate the time required to complete an activity ; also , it is often possible to complete an activity in less than normal time , at greater cost . CPM is designed to consider any additional data that may help in the comprehensive analysis of any project . In addition to normal times for these various activities the method can also consider crash time for these activities as well as the cost figures associated with these times . CPM , then , can provide management with a number of alternate schedules , each having a total project time somewhere within and including the limits of the all-crash and all-normal solutions . For each alternate plan there is a corresponding total project cost . For all but the smallest project , the computations necessary to produce this kind of information would be quite formidable . As a result , computers become a necessary tool in CPM work , and computer manufacturers can provide the necessary programs to make possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PERT concept is one that deals with time only . In PERT the planner is asked to supply three estimates of time for each activity : ( 1 ) an optimistic estimate , ( 2 ) a pessimistic estimate , and ( 3 ) the most realistic estimate . These three estimates are then used to give us not only an expected lapsed time for the entire project , but to give us a measure of the probability of meeting that expected completion date . Time estimates are usually expressed in calendar weeks although any unit of time could be used . The optimistic time estimate would be the least amount of time that an activity can take . This estimate would be made on the assumption that everything works the first time , and the estimate can be expected to be met in only one out of a hundred cases . The pessimistic estimate would be the maximum amount of time that an activity can take . // It would be the expected time if unusually had luck were experienced and would include the possibility of initial failure followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most likely time , would be the time used if only one time estimate is required . It is the expected time for an activity if that activity were repeated many times under identical conditions or , it would be the estimate given most often if many qualified persons were asked to provide such a time estimate . From the optimistic , most likely , and pessimistic times , the Expected Elapsed Time ( te ) can be obtained by statistical techniques . The relationship of the three estimates to the Expected Elapsed Time is given by the formula : Utilizing the formula given for the Expected Elapsed Time one can show that te for both of these activities would be identical or 4.00 . Just casual inspection of the data , however , shows that there is consider-ably more uncertainty associated with the expected time for the activity R than there is for the activity S. In PERT analysis work it is desirable to know the degree of uncertainty , or variance , associated with each expected time for such activity . This variance is calculated using the following formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most likely time estimate is given four times as much weight as the optimistic and pessimistic estimates when computing the expected time . The following table depicts two activities in a PERT network having identical most likely times , but different optimistic and pessimistic times : Tn other words , we are saying that 1 /6 of the range between the optimistic time and the pessimistic time is the estimate of the standard deviation . This figure when squared equals the variance . We now have a single best estimate of the time we expect an activity to take ( te ) and an estimate of the degree of certainty associated with that expected time . Tf we turn our attention from activities to events , we see that TE of an event is defined as the expected time for that event to be reached , given the expected activity times in a network . Two other definitions may be helpful . TS is called the scheduled time and is the contractual obligation date for the // whole project , or the schedule completion time for certain major events within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , is the latest allowable completion time for an event , so that an entire project is kept on schedule . The T , for each event must be defined in such a way that if every event in a network is completed by this time , the scheduled time for the entire project , TS , will be met . The slack of an event is a measurement of the excess time available to reach that event . It is the number of time units by which the latest allowable completion time exceeds the expected time for an event , or it would be TI - TE . The PERT COST system differs from PERT TIME inasmuch as two different estimates are required for each activity . These are ( 1 ) a minimum time estimate and its cost ; and ( 2 ) a minimum cost estimate and its time . The minimum cost estimate for all activities is used and the critical path determined for these data . The result would then be a completion date that is based upon minimum cost requirements for completing the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under these minimum cost conditions may be too great , and alternative times , requiring greater cost , can then be substituted for chosen minimum cost activities along the critical path . In this way , the critical path would be shortened until such time that either another branch becomes critical or a suitable compromise has been worked out along the original critical path . Obviously , compromises between cost and time are necessary for activities along the critical path , and this technique is designed to provide a logical approach to these trade-offs between cost and time . As with CPM , the computation for any project of appreciable size would be possible only with the assistance of a computer . Procedure Analysis and Work Simplification As with other manufacturing control systems and procedures , production planning and control lends itself to modern mechanization techniques such as machine accounting and use of electronic computers . Careful study of the control system through procedure analysis will indicate the savings that may be effected by the utilization of modern equipment . These savings may be in the clerical help required in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compilation of data , which in turn results in up-to-date control data . Many mechanical aids have been in use for some time . These are , in effect , mechanical Gantt charts , or adaptations thereof . Some of these devices are shown in Figures 14-9 and 14-10 . All control systems should be reviewed periodically to insure that all steps in the procedure are necessary to the effective operation of the plant . The maintenance of any record or form can only . be justified if it actually contributes to the current and future planning and control of the manufacturing activity .
