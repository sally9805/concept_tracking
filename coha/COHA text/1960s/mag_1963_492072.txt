A quiet revolution , as gentle but as persistent as a child 's night sounds , is shaking the world of adoption . For the first time in 30 years there are more children to be adopted than there are people to adopt them . An adoption worker in Alexandria , Virginia , sums up the present situ  --  ation when she says , " A few years ago , when the telephone jangled , we would say , ' Oh , no , not an  --  other couple wanting a baby ? ' Now when the phone rings we say , ' Oh , no , not another baby ! ' " It has always been difficult to find homes for older children most people want to adopt in  --  fants ) , those with physical handicaps , and racial-minority children . But today it is often hard to place the white , blue-eyed blonde , the " blue rib  --  bon baby . " Once there were 10 sets of prospective parents for each of these children . Now some ofthem are not adopted , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peggy , on the Post cover , has been waiting nine months at the Illinois Children 's Home and Aid Society in Chicago . A surplus of babies does not exist everywhere in the country  --  the pattern changes from region to region . But there are more babies than homes in enough places see page 18 to cause concern to those who work in adoption . There are many reasons for this " parent gap . " Illegitimacy has been on the rise in recent years , while at the same time there are fewer people in the age group most likely to adopt , the 25-35 ? year-old " depression babies . " People marry younger than they did a generation ago , increas  --  ing the chances that they will produce their own children . And doctors have made great gains insolving sterility problems . Religious attitudes are changing . Even the more conservative churches have forsaken the Scarier Letter approach ( " And now , Mistress Prynne , I leave thee alone ; alone with thy infant and the scarlet letter . " ) and have urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City living and a more turbulent world have changed attitudes toward children , natural or adopted . In an older , more rural society a family was considered a bit odd if there were no children , but in today 's city , where people pay little atten  --  tion to their neighbors , being childless bears no social stigma . Social workers interviewed across the country agree that Americans feel less secure economically than they did a decade ago . More important , many people view a world of H-bombs as an un  --  suitable place to bear or adopt children , " The subconscious strain of living in the shadow of the bomb has made people afraid to branch out , " says Gerald Blackwell of the Georgia Welfare Department . " It has become a rat-race sort of world , and people are taking a long , hard look before they assume more responsibility . " All these facts and changes in attitude have in  --  creased the number of adoptable children and have cut drastically into the supply of adopters . As placement of normal white infants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children with special needs  --  older children ( and today " older " means any child over eve ) , the physically handicapped and children of racial minorities or racial Mixtures  --  has become almost insoluble . In Chicago only 4 percent of the Negro babies offered for adoption find homes . Many un  --  wanted Negro infants stay for as long as six months in Cook County Hospital 's nursery . There they wither for lack of the loving care all babies need , and no hospital , no matter how well intentioned , can provide . After six months many are shunted of to institutions for the mentally re  --  tarded , because any baby who gets little pciscnal attention for six months can appear retarded . Despite efforts by social workers , prospects for placement of most children handicapped by color , physical defects or age are sadly slight . But something can be done for the increasing number of healthy white babies who arc going unadopted . While there is no quick and easy an  --  swer , one possible solution is to be found in Cali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tion are sanctioned . For years a nationwide battle has raged between supporters of adoption agen  --  cies and advocates of private adoption . The Child Welfare League of America , which has 240 adoption agencies as members , and the Federal Children 's Bureau have campaigned to label all nonagency adoption " black " or " gray " market . At the state level this campaign has been waged by departments of social welfare , at the local level by public and private adoption agencies . On the other side , private practitioners have made ir  --  responsible charges against agencies . But in Cali  --  fornia the two methods exist side by side . They do not enthuse about each other , and occasional sniping is carried on from both sides , but the state law permits both agency and nonagency adoption . California leads in adoptions With this dual system , more adoptions take place in California than in any other state  --  twice as many last year as in New York . Thus , some  --  thing can be gained from a study of California adoption practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including some of the most progressive in the country . But agency facili  --  ties still are not adequate to handle California 's adoption load , and the state maintains a pro  --  tected position for nonagency adoption . California doctors and lawyers consider it their right to assist patients and clients in arrang  --  ing private adoptions . They police themselves through their medical societies and bar associa  --  tions . They also come under the watchful eye of the State Department of Social Welfare . With similar supervision in other states , independent adoption could play a major role in eliminating the existing shortage of adoptive parents . To see how independent adoption works in California , we can examine the case of Judy , a 20-year-old brunette who arrived in San Fran  --  cisco last slimmer , pregnant and unmarried . Judy is intelligent , self-assured and uncommonly pretty . She was raised in a good , if strict , home in a small southern town . She spent her high-school years dating a little too much ( " I thought I had to be popular " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduated with passable grades and got a good job in a business office . In her senior year she began to date one boy stead  --  ily . He went off to college , they continued to go together , and Judy thought they would marry after his graduation . Then she became pregnant . She recalls : " When it happened , I called him at college . He said , ' Do n't worry , I 'll come right home and we 'll get married . ' He did come home , but his attitude changed . He seemed to be saying it was me who had been doing all the wrong things and he was still as pure as ever .... thought I loved him very much . There was a lot of sex in it , but we understood each other too . It was a kind of balance . But he changed in that talk . He still said he would marry me and quit school , but I said , No , thanks . ' I did n't want to be married under those circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married you because I had to . ' I did n't want that for me or for my children . So I called it off , and he went back to college . " Seeking help from her parents , Judy got little . They saw her pregnancy only as a disgrace to themselves , not as a problem for their daughter . " Those first few months were terrible , " Judy re  --  members , " I could n't talk to my parents at all , and 1 turned more and more to fantasy . i was really getting into a mess . " Fortunately , a relative who lived in the West picked that time to visit the family . He sympa  --  thized with Judy and suggested she go to Cali  --  fornia to have her baby . He got in touch with a doctor friend in San Francisco , who sent Judy to one of the leading obstetricians in the city . When she expressed interest in private , rather than agency , adoption . her obstetrician referred her to attorney Philip Adams , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Adams is 57 years old , with a slight build , a quick mind and a deep sense of humanity , which he hides behind a barrage of wisecracks . He will call a client at the hospital the day after she has delivered and ask , " How are you , my dear ? Want to go horseback riding ? " Once he did this while a visitor was sitting in his office . Adams noted the look of shock on his caller 's face . After he had hung up , he said , " What did you want me to say ? ' You have descended into the valley of the shadow of death , and you have survived , bless you ' ? This is n't Stella Dallas . This girl doesn'twant to be preached to or treated like an idiot . " Adams is only one of a dozen lawyers in the San Francisco area who handle a large number of adoption cases , but he is the best known . His book Ado/Won Pruclice fit California is regarded as authoritative by lawyers throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he once did , for he has an active general law prac  --  tice and is busy with many church , civic and political activities . When he does handle a case . his trademark is candor . Judy 's baby finds a home This frank approach to the questions of il  --  legitimate birth and adoption startles many cli  --  ents , but to Judy it was refreshing . " I could talk to him , " she says . " He was  --  you know  --  straight out , no pitying or anything like that , and not stuffy . I did n't mind his casual way of talking . If I had , I guess I would have left . Here was my whole life , and he talked about it like it was a box of cookies . But after a while I realized that this was just one small part of my life , like Mr. Adams said , and there trasan awful lot ahead of me . That made a tremendous difference . " Adams questioned Judy about her background and that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the kind of parents she preferred for her child . Thought Adams . too , has been running short of prospective parents lately , Judy was in luck . As the lawyer listened to her story , his mind hit upon a couple he thoughtmight be ideal , George and Mary Fulton . The names arc fictitious . ) He had known a cousin of George for many years and through him had met the couple . The Fultons had been married seven years and had been unable to have children . George Fulton had a good income , and the couple lived in a charming home in the Berkeley hills , overlooking San Francisco Bay . Most im  --  portant , they truly wanted children and had asked Adams if he could help . Adams was as candid with Mr. and Mrs. Fulton as he is with natural parents . " Independent adoption can be risky . " he points out . " A lot of things can go wrong . They usually do n't , but I think it is my duty as s lawyer to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Satisfied that there were few stars in the eyes of Mary and George Fulton , Adams told them about Judy . They were interested . Then he made the astonishing suggestion that they meet , to make their own decisions about the adoption . Anonymity has been sacred to adoption for as long as there have been adoption agencies . When Adams first began to handle adoption cases , he accepted it as a rule , but several years ago he be  --  gan to suggest personal meetings . They were so successful that now , in most of his cases , the adopting parents meet the mot her , and sometimes the natural father . Juck liked the idea of a meeting ' " I had a lot of curiosity about the people . " But , like most adopting couples , the Fultons , especially Mary , resisted the suggestion at iiisl . As she explains it , " I guess it was that basically I felt I was taking this girl 's baby . I was n't going through any of the pain or the struggle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital and take that baby away . 1 just could n't seem to cope with that . " Adams tried to persuade her but without apparent suc  --  cess , and it was agreed that George Fulton would meet Judy alone . But on the day of the meeting his wife changed her mind . " I finally came to terms with myself , " Mary says simply . " We went to dinner and spent several of the most fascinat  --  ing hours of our lives , We liked Judy very much and wished we had met under other circumstances so we could remain friends . " Judy approved of the Fultons too : " When I had met them and knew what kind of people they ere . I knew I was making the right choice , and I could really stop thinking about that part of it forever . I would never think of going back to try to see the child . " The adoption agreed upon , the Fultons estab  --  lished a trust fund in the lawyer 's office , guaran  --  teeing Judy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couple about S1,100-5650 for hospital and medical expenses , 5400 for legal fees and 550 for incidentals . Had they adopted from a private agency , the fee would have been 5600 to 5750 . This was early summer . Through the remaining four months of her pregnancy Judy was in con  --  stant touch with Adams , the Fultons , and , of course , her obstetrician . The pregnancy was un  --  complicated , and in September Judy gave birth to a healthy baby girl . A week later Mary and George came to take the baby home . Judy saw them as she was walking down the hospital cor  --  ridor , " I thought of stopping to say hello and wish them the best of luck , and then I thought , No , it 's better if I do n't . The child is n't mine any  --  more . It is hers and she has to start to Nye with it . I 'm out of the picture and I had heifer stay out . We had exchanged a favor for a favor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't give it . I was giving them a child they wanted very much . Things were even now , and if 1 had stopped to talk to them they might have felt em  --  barrassed or something , and I did n't want that . Then things would n't have been even anymore . So I kept on going down the hall to my room . " Judy likes San Francisco and thinks she might settle there . But first she plans one trip home . " I want to see my parents , " she says . " I can talk to them now . Since I 've been out here , they have written things to me they had never said before . I think we 'll be closer now . And I would like to see the baby 's father . He did feel a lot for me , I 'm sure , and I 'm afraid now he looks in the mirror and tells himself what a heel he is . I would like to sec him once more and tell him not to worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past . " Next month the Fultons will go to court to adopt their daughter officially . Judy signed a con  --  sent to adopt , a statement to the State Depart  --  ment of Social Welfare , shortly after she left the hospital . The department then investigated the couple and found their home suitable . The adop  --  tion petition probably will he granted in a rou  --  tine , brief hearing . Then the original birth certif  --  icate will he sealed by the court , for the protec  --  tion of the child , and a new birth certificate will he issued in the name of the Fultons . Only a court order can permit access to the original document , and such an order is rarely given . The end of this story can not be written . Judy 's child should have a happy life with Mary and George Fulton , but this is no certainty . Somc. things are certain , however . A girl whose life might have been severely damaged , had she re  --  mained in her bitter home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has gained some useful insights along the way . And two people who possess the ability to love and care for a child now have one . This is one California nonagency adoption . Not all work this well . One that did not was the adop  --  tion of a baby girl two years ago by Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Slattery of San Rafael , a San Francisco suburb . Joan and Toni Slattery had an adopted son , a year old , and nine months later they adopted a second child , a girl they named Meghan . But a few weeks after the child entered the Slatterys ' home , her natural parents reclaimed her , " The baby had just learned to smile , " Joan Slattery recalls , all too well . " She had just reached that point where she was getting to you . " But the Slatterys faced up to the facts and returned Meghan , A few months later they adopted an  --  other girl and named her Meghan also . " Losing the first Meghan was a tough thing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no getting around that , but you absorb it , and our second Meghan pushed it all into the background . " The risks of private adoption The possibility of such a reversal is one of many objections which California adoption-agency spokesmen and welfare officials voiced when questioned about an independent adoption like Judy 's . In an agency adoption the mother re  --  linquishes her child legally before a placement is made . In an independent adoption there is a six-month period , between placing of the child and the final court hearing , in which the mother can change her mind . If she does , most California judges will support her decision . Losses such as the Slatterys suffered can be grievous , and agencies consider them a strong disadvantage of private adoption . Agency supporters firmly believe that only an agency , utilizing the combined skills of social workers , doctors , psychologists and others , is equipped to make adoption judgments . Judy and the Fultons had made their own decisions , with the assistance of their lawyer and obstetrician . " None of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucile Kennedy , peppery chief of California 's Department of Family and Child Welfare . Miss Kennedy grants that her department usually approves the parents when it checks on an independent adoption , but she objects to be  --  ing presented with a fait accompli . " When we first learn about an independent adoption , the child is already in the home . Conditions have to be pretty bad for a caseworker to recommend that a child be taken out of a home , so we pass a lot of borderline cases . " Agency workers regard personal meetings be  --  tween natural and adopting parents as poten  --  tially disastrous . If the mother knows the parents or her child , they reason , she may return one day , out of curiosity or malice , to plague them . Yet one highly reputable California agency is giving thought to experimenting with personal meetings . " What would happen to that baby if it had been deformed ? " asks an agency director . " I doubt if the lawyer would stand behind the child then . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a child back to its mother , 19 but Philip Adams and most others do not . Adams works hard to see that the child gets the best possible care . Also , in 1962 he handled the adop  --  tion of a child with a family history of hemo  --  philia and five babies of white-Negro parentage , all cases that had been turned down by private and public agencies . Agency protagonists cite other arguments against independent adoptions , but these are the main ones . Placements by doctors and lawyers are considered the worst sin . Replying to these criticisms , Philip Adams contends that his long experience with adoption has provided him with as much knowledge as many a holder of a master 's degree in social work . He doubts Lucile Kennedy 's claim that her caseworkers approve many " borderline " families . In this he is supported by veteran social worker Norma Bentley , who spent 14 years with California 's Department of Social Welfare . She has investigated more than 5,000 private adop  --  tions . " I think I kept closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , " says Mrs. Bentley , " and out of those 5,000 independent adoptions I know of only five that did n't work out . " Over the years Adams has accumulated a thick file of approving letters from natural and adop  --  tive parents , attesting to the value of personal meetings . " These meetings convince the adopt  --  ing couple that the girl is firm in her mind about adoption , " he says , " and they convince the mother that her baby is going into a good home . They enable the people involved to make their own decisions and not have them made by other people : that 's the important thing . " Adams is a strong supporter of adoption agencies . He handles several agency adoptions every year . But he has found that agencies suit some people and not others . " Judy 's case makes the point , " he says . " This is pretty much a matter of temperament . The independent girl  --  the girl with a little more edu  --  cation or a good job or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two feet  --  feels better with a direct adoption . The less self-reliant girl , the younger girl , feels better at an agency . The same is true of adopting parents . Those with more in  --  dependence seem to choose direct adoption . " Girls who place their children directly  --  women , I should say , because some of my clients are in their twenties and thirties and some older than that  --  these women are above average in in  --  telligence and background . I would say they look at the situation with more realism than they used to . ' Oh , the horror ! Oh , the heartbreak of it all ! ' ? that 's pretty much gone . A girl gets preg  --  nant informally ( Adams skirts the words " illegiti  --  mate " and " unwed " as he would a swamp ) , faces it squarely , makes plans for the child and then takes up her life again . " Adams admits that the six-month wait for a final adoption decree is a period of anxiety for adopting couples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind . This happens in one out of every 30 cases he handles . However . in all but three cases , the couple soon adopted another child , again independently . Adams makes it clear toclients that they must pay medical and hospital bilk for the mother , no matter what happens to the child , and that they might lose this money if the mother changes her mind about adoption after the baby has been born ( though in many such cases , the money is returned to the dis  --  appointed adopters / . If independent adoption has all these hazards , why do a majority of Californians choose it ? Some agency spokesmen contend that only those refused by agencies turn to private adoption . There is some truth in that claim , but very little . Many people simply dislike adoption agencies . Much of this point of view is caught in the comments of C. Coleman Blease , a young lawyer and part-time instructor at the University of California in Berkeley . Says Blease , " The agencies sit there with all the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you have no recourse but to accept their decisions . 1 have n't met that many people in my life who know that much about other people . My wife and I wanted to make our own decisions . " So Barbara and Coleman Blease chose direct adoption , as did 4,827 other couples in California last year . Another 4,328 rejected these arguments in favor of the greater security offered by agency adoption . The two methods live in relatively peaceful coexistence in the nation 's most popu  --  lous state , and it is probable that they will con  --  tinue to do so . Other states , other views Beyond California 's borders the status of in  --  dependent adoption varies widely . In the East there is relatively little . Connecticut and Dela  --  ware all but forbid it . Many eastern states make it extremely difficult . There were only 100 inde  --  pendent adoptions in Massachusetts in 1961 . But in Chicago independent adoptions increased 45 percent between 1958 and 1961 , from 640 to 929 , while agency adoptions remained static at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private and agency adoptions are evenly divided , and excellent doctors and lawyers assist with place  --  ments . This is true in many western states . Several state bar associations and state medi  --  cal societies have passed resolutions condemning independent adoption . In part these resolutions reflect the success of pro-agency campaigns by the Child Welfare League and the Children 's Bureau . But they also reflect the disgust with which able professionals view the " black-market baby " scandals of past years . There is little black-market activity today , for the world still awaits the merchant prince who can operate a black market with a surplus commodity . But the odor left by fee-gouging lawyers and unscrupulous doctors , who peddled infants for profit when there was a shortage of adoptable babies , still hangs heavy in the air in many states . Some strict adoption laws do not find their justification in the revulsion felt by honorable men when faced with black-market-baby activity , but rather in religious doctrine . Many state laws make it difficult , if not impossible , for a coupleto adopt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural parent consents . These laws are largely the result of Catholic pressure on legislatures , and they work mainly to penalize Jews , for there are never as many Jewish babies available as there are anxious would-bc Jewish parents , not even today . Catholic and non-Catholic adoption agencies often work to  --  gether on the local level , but when the question of state law arises , the most conservative Catholic position seems to prevail . As a result , many Catholic children go homeless while some Jewish families must endure the cold ache of childless  --  ness . For example , Massachusetts had more than 4,000 children in foster homes at the end of 1962 , many of whom would have been adopted had it not been for religious restrictions in the state law . Removal of these religious barriers would help end the present shortage of adopting parents . Expansion of agency facilities , public and private , would help . Another big step would be accept  --  ance by all adoption agencies of the flexible standards now held by many : higher age limits for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , placement of more than one child in the same family , less concern about matching physical characteristics and less insistence on a substantial bank account or home ownership as requirements for adoptive parents . But the most important step that could be taken , in the view of doctors and lawyers interviewed across the country , is acceptance of California 's point of view toward independent adoption . Joseph H. Reid , executive director of the Child Welfare League , disagrees . " Adoption is a social institution , in which society should have an in  --  terest , " says Reid . " We take the radical position that the individual has no rights here . A parent who does not wish to keep her child forfeits her rights to that child . She does not have the right to go out and find a home on her own . Likewise , adoptive parents do not have the right just to go out and find a kid someplace . Adopting a child is not a right but a privilege .... Society must insist on the right to see to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , and this , we say , can only be done by an agency . We base our stand on equity , equity for the child , not for the natural parents or for the adoptive parents . " Thousands of natural parents , adoptive par  --  ents and adopted children , for whom independent adoption has worked successfully , would dispute Reid 's statement vigorously . They argue that while he talks of ' " equity for the child " many of these children are spending their lives in foster homes and orphanages . Judge Theresa Meikle , who served for 20 years on the Superior Court III San Francisco before stepping down in 1960 , says , " I believe in private adoptions , and I believe in agency adoptions . These are matters of tem  --  perament and subtlety . They ca n't always be de  --  cided by words or laws . 1 have found social work  --  ers who are skilled , dedicated , hard-working people in the field of adoption , and 1 have found doctors and lawyers who are equally dedicated , **36;2228;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both .
