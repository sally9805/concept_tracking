 | Let the Dead Teach the Living HALF OF U.S. medical schools , despite the excellence of their faculties , plant and laboratory facilities , face ritical shortages of a basic teachng material : human corpses , used fur study of body structure and function . Says Dr. Othmar C. Solnitzky of Georgetown University School of Medicine : " The situation is all but desperate today , and is growing worse . Unless medicine is t() degenerate into pill peddling , this 1iroblem must be solved . " Observes the head of the department of anatomy in one of the nation 's top medical schools : " You , imply can not teach this subject with lantern slides and pictures . It is on the human body that the physician must learn structure and function . How many people would patronize a garage whose mechanics had only a textbook acquaintance with the internal-combustion engine ? " Ideally , two students should have one cadaver on which to spend a year learning basic anatomy . But today the more fortunate schools accept a four-to-one ratio , and many have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported only six bodies available for 7o first-year anatomy students . The situation has become so acute that some colleges have had to  | abandon courses in surgical anatomy , in which , usually in the fourth year of study , the surgeon-to-be learns basic operative techniques . A famous ear surgeon , who requires human tissue and bone for teaching his extremely delicate operation for the relief of deafness , finds it necessary to import material from a charity hospital in Hong Kong . Shortages of anatomical material began to occur in the 1930 'S with the flood of social-welfare legislation . Lawmakers responded to emotional appeals to provide " decent burial " for the indigent , and for nearly everyone else . Social Security now contributes up to $255 apiece toward funeral expenses for over 640,000 persons annually . The Veterans Administration will chip in as much as $250 . State and county welfare organizations , fraternal groups and labor organizations also provide death benefits for this purpose . " In some cases , " says Ralph Rohweder of the National Society for Medical Research , " organizations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funerals . " As a result , the dead " unmourned and unwanted by anybody , " which once were available to medical schools , have become articles of commerce for marginal undertakers . In 27 states a " friend " may claim a body ? but statutes are n't specific about what constitutes a friend . Until District Commissioners tightened regulations , in Washington " curbstone undertakers " would hire a passer-by on the street , for a fee of $15 , to act as a " friend " and claim the tithe wise unclaimed body of an expire hospital ward patient . The uncle taker would then collect whatever burial funds were available . Mu while , Washington 's three medic schools remain chronically short anatomical material . Having once secured a license t practice , an embalmer or funeral director is subject to no profession al policing authority . The Na tional Funeral Directors Associatio points out that , if abuses occur charges should be filed with licen ing authorities ? something medica schools are reluctant to do . The would fare badly , they think , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent burl al . " Though virtually every state ha " anatomical laws " which require un claimed dead to be delivered t medical schools , in most cases no penalties are attached to enforce them . Many local welfare authorities therefore ignore these laws , give precedence to the later-enacted welfare legislation which provides death benefits , and zealously claim all bodies for burial . The superintendent of a Midwestern mental institution , for example , refused to deliver any unclaimed body to medical schools . Instead he had an arrangement with an undertaker . Inmates of the institution would dig the grave and act as pallbearers , while the undertaker provided a plain pine box ? and collected a $150 fee . Statistically , the total needs of  | medical schools for all teaching purposes are minuscule . Five thousand ) dies a year would fill all needs in he United States ? less than one bird of one percent of total annual deaths of 1,700,000 .. Yet , even in such reat teaching centers as Boston and New York the shortage of cadavers remains chronic . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools envisioned by the Kennedy administration are built . There are a few spots where the picture is not so dark . By one recent estimate , eight of the country 's 86 medical schools have a surplus of anatomical material , in most instances resulting from state legislation . Florida , for example , provides no cash benefits for the burial of unclaimed dead , but requires municipalities to provide free plots , and undertakers to provide free services on a rotation basis . As a result , municipal authorities and undertakers Alike are anxious to meet medicalschool needs . Only one state , Maine , permits shipment of unclaimed bodies across is state line . Thus , areas with a surplus of anatomical material can not help those that are short . Virginia , which has a surplus , can not aid the District of Columbia . Florida anatomists can not help meet Tennessee 's shortages . Kansas ca n't help the hard-pressed Illinois medical schools . Notes Dr. Benjamin Spector of Tufts Medical School : " Legislators should be made aware that it is the public who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advancement of anatomical science , medical practice an research . " The National Society for Medical Research in Chicago will assist medical societies , universities , legislators or other interested groups in preparing model legislation . Many physicians feel there is a simpler approach than legislation . Might n't it be easier , they ask , to acquaint the public with the need ? and hope that large numbers will bequeath their bodies for teaching and research ? A movement is under way to get medical students and dental students , who also need cadavers for anatomical studies , to pledge their own bodies for this eventual purpose . Already numbers of people are offering their remains to medical schools . " Many are older people who have gone through long illness and do n't wish to deplete their estates further with expensive funerals , " says Dr. S. R. M. Reynolds , head of the department of anatomy of the University of Illinois College of Medicine . " Others wish to make a kind of return to medical science for benefits they have received ; still others have a frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are helping solve the problem in a number of states ? 3o percent of the need is met by bequests in Vermont and Connecticut . Californians have responded so willingly that all medical-school needs  | have been met . In a moving appeal for others to follow his example , a young man suffering from an incurable heart ailment wrote : " It has long been my desire to make a significant contribution to my alma mater , U.C.L.A. My short life expectancy does not indicate that I will be able to do this during my lifetime . In willing my body to the medical school , I feel that I am , in a measure , fulfilling that desire . " Under Common Law a person 's body belongs at death to the next of kin . Thus , the individual may have no control over the disposition of his own body . To solve this problem , 27 states have passed " bequest laws " which permit people to donate their corneal tissue and other body parts for transplantation . In all but three of these states , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching . In states where it is legal to receive donations of bodies , most medical schools provide triplicate forms ? one copy for the donor , one for the next of kin , one for the medical school . Some also provide wallet cards stating the wishes of the donor and giving instructions for carrying them out . This is a better procedure than simply stating one 's wishes in a will , because burial very often takes place before the will is r Many people fear that their mains will be treated disrespectfully by medical students . These Icars largely ungrounded . Discovery the awesome wonders of the hut body is a sobering experience one that instills respect . The legend that hangs over the d of many dissection rooms is a c stant reminder of purpose : Mo vivos docent ? the dead teach living . There is a growing practice chapels to be built in medic schools , where funeral services conducted at the conclusion of an omy courses . Many schools n emphasize the idea that bodies a " loaned " for study , and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to meet religious sc ples ? Catholics , for example , bei buried in consecrated ground . Or , desired , the body is later return to relatives in a sealed casket f memorial services and burial . Possibly the most attractive asp of willing one 's body to a medic school is that an individual 's useful ness does n't end with death . By a sisting young students to acquire difficult and exacting skill , the donor makes an invaluable contribution to succeeding generations . @#
