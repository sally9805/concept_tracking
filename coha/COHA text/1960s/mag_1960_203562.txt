A little over a century ago , in the bustling seaport of New Bedford , Mass. , a man and a boy found a common interest . The boy , Albert Pinkham Ryder , the son of the town 's jack-of-all-trades , was only eleven at the time . But town legend has it that every so often he would cross Mill Street to watch his neighbor Albert Bierstadt , 28 , paint . In time , both left their home town to seek their fortunes as artists , but if their paths ever crossed after that , there is no record of it . Last week , as New Bedford 's Swain School of Design opened the town 's first Ryder-Bierstadt show , they were back together again-two local boys who made good , in strangely different ways . <P> Bierstadt 's father had been a German professional soldier before coming to the U.S. , and courtly young Albert himself had studied in Germany . In 1858 he decided to head for St. Louis to join General Frederick Landers ' mapping expedition to the Pacific . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His big ( 6 ft. by 10 ft . ) Landers ' Peak , Rocky Mountains was sold for $25.000 ; his Storm in the Rocky Mountains ( 12 ft. by 7 ft. ) brought $35,000 . British critics raved about him ( " as devoted a lover of the grandest scenes in nature as any painter who ever lived ' ' ) . The French gave him the Legion of Honor , and the Austrians bestowed on him their Order of St. Stanislas . At 37 , tall , proud Albert Bierstadt was at his peak . <P> The Great Clutter . Collectors did not find the other Albert so much to their taste . A moody man who came to hate having to meet anyone new , he did not copy nature , but shaped it with his own violent rhythms and dark dreams . In 1908 the great British critic Roger Fry at last wrote a piece about him , but the world at large still failed to take notice . By that time , Ryder was already an unkempt eccentric with wild hair and ragged clothes who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of newspapers , bottles , unwashed dishes , dirty clothes and unfinished paintings that grew more frightening every year . He refused to let handymen in for necessary repairs , was so averse to housekeeping that he preferred to sleep on the floor rather than face putting a clean sheet on his bed . <P> Only after his death was Ryder recognized as one of America 's masters . Bierstadt 's oversize canvases disappeared from museum walls , and one after another , they found their way to storerooms and attics . Critics dismissed them as huge postcards , and some declared that it was more Bierstadt 's commanding manner than his talent that had brought him such high prices . But last week viewers at the New Bedford show could see why the story did not end there . <P> A Certain Grandeur . In such Ryder canvases as his famous Toilers of the Sea , the genius of the dreamer comes through with its familiar brooding power . But when Bierstadt was confronted by a scene like Lake Tahoe , he displayed a certain grandeur worthy of the sweep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a dealer offered $15,000 for a Bierstadt that went for only $2,200 in 1946 . If Ryder remains the master , Bierstadt. too , is still a part of the permanent American gallery .
