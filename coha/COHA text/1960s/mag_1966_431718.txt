 | How Soon Will We Wear Paper Clothes ? WHEN wear-and-throwaway paper dresses were introduced last spring at $1.25 apiece , a revolution in the lathing industry seemed to have arrived . Reports on the dresses were published in scores of newspapers here and abroad . Orders came in to she manufacturer , the Scott Paper ( ' o. , by the thousands . Dealers and distributors made inquiries . Actual , v , the dresses were dreamed up by Scott primarily as a device to promote its other paper products ; they ire not yet available on a wide scale.But the facts show that we are closer disposable paper clothes than ' lost people think . Work garments made of paper are AIready an actuality . Every Pan American World Airways plane carries cartons of attractive paper aprons which match the hostesses ' light-blue uniforms . They are worn in the galley , then discarded as casually as paper napkins . One chain of beauty shops buys paper . gowns by the thousands ? pink with white piping ? for customers to wear in salons . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a California firm specializing in disposable items : paper coats for laboratory workers , paper gowns for food processors , paper shoe covers ( four million a year ) to prevent tracking dust and dirt into hospital operating rooms . Says Harold Zimmon , president of the firm , " Within a decade , any industrial firm with  | jobs that soil clothing will be using disposable smocks or coveralls . " Recently , when I had to repaint a door in our apartment , I pulled on a paper coverall and had complete protection from paint splashing . Carried in the trunk of your automobile in case you have to change a tire , this coverall can save you a drycleaning bill and permit you to get to a business appointment without grease on your pants . It costs about $1.75 , but is reasonably durable and , like many disposables , can be kept for more than one use . All this has come about because two of our largest paper companies , Scott and Kimberly-Clark , have each recently perfected reinforced materials ? a thin netting of rayon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandwiched between layers of specially processed paper ? which look , feel and wear much like cloth . The materials , before being made into dresses and other apparel , can be treated to make them fire-retardant , water- and abrasionresistant ? or even luminous , as in jackets for highway workers . Doctors and hospitals are already using disposable paper garments ranging from jackets and examination gowns to surgical drape sheets . The economics are simple : a throwaway examination gown costing 25 cents takes the place of a cloth gown with a typical laundering charge of 35 cents . One gynecologist in private practice reports that paper gowns have other advantages besides savings : they come in a compact box of 50 , are easily stored , involve no problems with stains , tears or missing ties . Moreover , patients like having a gown that has never been used before . Paper fabric is now moving into other areas . Two firms have brought out academic caps and gowns made of paper : you use at graduation then throw away . Men 's swim trunks , made from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market : Du Pont developed the material for bookbinding and wall coverings , then tried it successfully on swimsuits . Good for several wearings , they are bought by motels at $8.50 to $9.50 a dozen then sold or given away to customers . I have used them : they start up remarkably well and look much better than you 'd think . Paper bibs and simple baby dresses are also being made . So are paper sheets and pillowcases , though the sheets are as yet wide enough only for a bunk . Last spring the Defense Department asked for bids for more than two million disposable wash cloths . Paper underwear may next ? one manufacturer in North Carolina has shown samples to the Army . The problem is getting the price down to where it is competitive with the laundry costs cloth items . Simple items ? pillow cases and headrest covers ? are ready competitive , and enjoy m sales to railroads and airlines . However , the notable fact in the world of disposable items is that the ways of the consumer are not al- ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most fabulously successful disposables of all time , does n't save money , but offers convenience and sanitation . Paper napkins are not as economical as the system of individual cloth napkins if the housewife does her own laundry . For years , housewives laboriously emptied vacuum-cleaner dust bags ; when the handy throwaway bag came along , they adopted it enthusiastically without a thought to increased cost . Right now , a similar trend can be seen with disposable diapers . These have been available some time , but used ones were always hard to get rid of . Now , the newest type can be flushed down the toilet ? and sales in test markets have increased tenfold . All this is a tribute to convenience over economy .. Another notable fact about disposable items is that many of them catch on slowly . The paper towel , for instance , was introduced into factories by Scott in 1907 when a carload of paper failed to meet specificaions ? too thick and heavy to be made into toilet tissue . The company converted it into paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home use , and even then consumer acceptance was low . But today housewives use more than a billion rolls of paper towels a year . If commercial history is any guide , the spread of each disposable paper item will tend to open the door for still other items . Paper napkins helped make paper placemats acceptable . The throw-away examination gown tends to make people accept throw-away beach ponchos , and that in turn helps open the door to simple sheath-like throw-away dresses . One manufacturer plans to market " Waste Basket Boutique " dresses , retailing at one dollar , this summer . Still , it is doubtful that there will be a major expansion into everyday paper clothes until there is a significant breakthrough in fabrication . This is the stumbling block : it costs as much to have a garment worker sewing on ten-cents-a-yard paper fabric as on ten-dollars-a-yard silk . But considering the potential profits , it seems probable that a solution will be found ? perhaps machines which die-cut and heat-seal dozens of garments in a single operation . The time may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garments , in cartons of a dozen or so , at the local supermarket . @#
