txt An organized effort to compel Congress to summon a constitutional convention is near its goal , although most of the nation has been completely unaware of the existence - of this effort or of any need for it . The American Farm Bureau Federation and allied organizations , working under the political guidance of Senator Everett Dirksen , Republican leader in the Senate , have been the main force behind this campaign . At their instigation , the legislatures of 32 states , mostly in the South and West , have passed resolutions during the past several years requesting Congress to call a convention for the purpose of overturning the Supreme Court 's reapportionment decisions . In place of the Court 's one-man , one-vote rule , the states want the right to apportion one house of their legislatures on some basis other than population . Senator Dirksen has repeatedly pushed this proposal as a constitutional amendment , but he has been unable to obtain the necessary approval of twothirds of the Senate . Failing to gain their objective in Congress , he and his rural supporters have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Incredibly , the approval of only two more states is needed to achieve the first step , the calling of a constitutional convention under Article V of the Federal Constitution . But the drive is wrong in its purpose and dangerous in its method . * * The one-man , one-vote decisions are the most constructive developments in state government in decades . By making legislatures more representative and more responsive to the needs of cities and suburbs , they are beginning to reinvigorate state government and thereby slow the drift of power to Washington that has been weakening this country 's Federal system . Those who believe in states ' rights do the cause of federalism a disservice by attempting to restore the unrepresentative , rural dominated , rotten borough legislatures of yesterday . Rural and small town interests may conceivably suffer as their excessive political power is cut back , but no evidence yet exists to prove such damage . It would be a mistake to abandon the promising benefits of apportionment reform merely to avert harm that is hypothetical . The summoning of a convention by two-thirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a perfectly proper and constitutional procedure . But if such a convention took place , there would be no way to confine it to the reapportionment question . It could go oh to change the Bill of Rights or drastically alter other provisions of the Constitution . When the original Constitutional Convention met in 1787 there was widespread public recognition that the Articles of Confederation provided an inadequate framework of government . There is no comparable widespread demand for change today . There has been no national debate and no popular ferment . Indeed , since it is estimated that 26 of the 32 resolutions were passed by malapportioned legislatures that have subsequently been redistricted by court order , there is genuine doubt as to how much public support these resolutions command . Under these circumstances , it would be at best mischievous and at worst reckless to summon a convention that might rewrite the basic charter of government and plunge the nation into a distracting controversy over the ratification of such changes . The legislatures would do well to re-examine and rescind their resolutions and get on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
