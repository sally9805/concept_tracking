The House Ways and Means Committee had haggled for weeks over three rival schemes dealing with medical care for the aged : 1 ) The Administration 's medicare program aimed at compulsory hospital insurance through social security ; 2 ) a Republican alternative proposing a federally assisted voluntary protection system , covering both hospitals and doctors ; and 3 ) " elder-care , " the American Medical Association 's widely publicized plan , under which federal-state funds would help pay private premiums on the basis of need , in an extension of the 1960 Kerr-Mills Act authorizing aid to the medically indigent elderly . <P> Then , in a master political stroke , Chairman Wilbur Mills proposed a sugarcoated , horse-pill-sized medical care bill containing aspects of all three plans . And last week , by a 17-8 vote , the committee approved the Mills bill . Its key provisions : <P> &gt; For everyone 65 or older , 60 days of hospital room and board for each illness , plus drugs , without charge after an initial $40 deductible ; also , up to 100 days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting nurse per year . All of these benefits would be financed by social security taxes , which would rise in eight steps over the next 21 years , more than doubling the maximum annual employee contribution from $174 at present to $369.60 by 1987 . <P> &gt; A voluntary plan providing an additional 100 home nursing visits per year - plus coverage of 80% of doctors ' fees and 80% of related necessities such as bandages , X rays and lab tests . Participants would have to be 65 or over , pay $3 per month , which would be matched by the Federal Government . <P> <P> &gt; A broadening of Kerr-Mills to grant federal-state medical help not only to indigent people 65 or older , as at present , but also to certain other needy people regardless of age-those blind and disabled , members of indigent families , and homeless children . They would receive a full range of doctor and hospital services , with other benefits left to the states . The minimum federal share of the program would be raised from 50% to 55% . <P> Benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1966 . Retroactive to Jan. 1 , 1965 , would be the accompanying sweetener : a basic 7% increase in social security pensions , with everyone getting at least $4 more a month , and a host of other expanded social security benefits . <P> The total estimated cost of the three-in-one medical care package per year would be close to $6 billion-$2.3 billion for hospital costs , $1.1 billion for doctors , $200 million for the enlarged Kerr-Mills bill , $2.1 billion more for social security benefits . Officials estimated that $5 billion would come from social security taxes and voluntary payments , the remaining amount from Government general revenues . <P> President Johnson immediately gave the Mills bill his blessing , called it " a tremendous step forward for our senior citizens . " Republicans planned a last-ditch fight to amend the measure by extending its voluntary provisions to hospitalization and establishing an income ceiling on participants . But they had little hope , and Wilbur Mills ' bill seemed virtually certain to be the final blueprint for the medicare law , opening the way to a vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
