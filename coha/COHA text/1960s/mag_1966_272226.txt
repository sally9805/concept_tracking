Hotel Paradiso . Putting the right people in the wrong beds is the principal preoccupation of French farce , but this sumptuous period piece gets rather confused about the sleeping arrangements : it 's the moviegoer who does most of the yawning . <P> The actors work assiduously trying to put new bounce into a comedy written more than half a century ago by Georges Feydeau and Maurice Desvallires . Gina Lollobrigida , looking as delicately outraged as a piece of fine cracked china , plays the neglected bourgeois wife of bumptious Robert Morley . In revenge , she undertakes a night on the town with Neighbor Alec Guinness . The sly old seducer lures her to a disreputable inn where-true to formula-his promised evening of bliss ends up as a harmless orgy of slammed doors and mistaken identity , climaxed by a chase involving a fat lady , a nephew , an upstairs maid , a seething proprietor , a bellboy , gendarmes , four skittish schoolgirls , an underdressed chanteuse and a doddering duke . <P> Paradiso is an eye opener only when Photographer Henri Decae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belle poque make decades melt away-particularly in a smoky , golden caf scene reminiscent of Lautrec , with portly naiads up to their chins in gym suits and a matronly stripper dismantling her corsetry on an overhead swing . Also visible behind the potted palms and spiral staircases is Director Peter Glenville , impersonating Playwright Feydeau . Glenville as Feydeau wears a wise , conspiratorial expression , presumably to suggest that middle-class morality can be terribly droll . But Glenville as Glenville has n't the faintest idea of how to get the fun on film .
