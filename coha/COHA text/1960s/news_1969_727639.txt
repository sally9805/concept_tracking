txt Tacked on the wall of the Inner City Apostolate were four new slips from hungry MexicanAmerican families asking for food . The Rev. Ralph H. Ruiz , who runs the mission for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Antonio , glanced at the slips and exclaimed angrily : " The whole welfare system in Texas stinks . " The mission is on the fringe of Alazan-Apache Courts , the city 's oldest public housing project , where some 6,000 Mexican-Americans live in wretched poverty and frequent hunger . Of all the nation 's ethnic groups ? white , black , brown or red ? the " Mexicanos " are suspected by nutritionists of being most vulnerable to hunger . For although there are nearly five million of them scattered through the Southwest , the Mexican-Americans have generally been undemonstrative about their misery , complaining so seldom of empty stomachs that the " Angles " ( the that most Indians can no longer live on goats and sheep . Efforts to bring industry have had minimal success , providing a few hundred jobs , // non-Mexican whites ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet taken to the streets of San Antonio . Hungrier even than the Mexican-Americans , but less obtrusive because they are smaller in number and confined mainly to isolated wastelands , are the reservation Indians . Of the more than 300,000 Indians living on reservations , the largest tribe by far is the Navajo of northeastern Arizona . Altogether , 115,000 Navajos exist on an arid plateau bigger than the whole state of West Virginia . The Last Frontier The western half of this remote region , the state 's last frontier , was not opened up by roads until about 13 years ago . Even today there are Navajos who live 50 miles from the nearest improved road . Last year 20 infants were brought in dead at medical stations , according to Dr. George E. Bock , the United States Public Health Service medical director , and 18 of those deaths were attributable to delay in reaching medical aid . At Tuba City , administrative center for the western half of the reservation , Dr. Jean Van Duzen , chief of pediatrics at the Indian Hospital , reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases of kwashiorkor ( extreme protein deficiency ) among Navajo children in the last five years . The high incidence of those two rarely found diseases would be considered fantastic anywhere else in the nation . Dr. Van Duzen said that 15 of the 44 victims died . Among Mexican-Americans in the slums of San Antonio the ravages of hunger may be less spectacular but more degrading . Father Ruiz said Mexican-Americans found the welfare apparatus unbearably cold and inhuman . Father Ruiz 's irritation with Texas welfare was mainly prompted , ' lie explained , by a recent lowering of the ceiling on monthly welfare payments from $135 , for a family of four or more , to $123 . ; , " Texas is the only state , I believe , that requires legislation every time it wants to raise the level of welfare . A referendum to increase the payments was defeated last year . The cut was made because the increasing relief load threatened to exhaust the welfare appropriation . And now there is talk of another cut . " Food Stamps Run Short He took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanse of low , concrete block buildings with small apartments . In one home , sparsely furnished but very clean , Mrs. Joanne Gutierrez told how she and her four children existed on a $123-amonth welfare check . " I buy no clothes for myself , " she said . ' ' l wear castoffs from my mother and sister-inlaw . Each month she paid $54 to get food stamps that bought her $94 worth of commodities . She echoed a familiar complaint about the food stamp program ? instead of providing enough food to last a month , the supply ran out in about two weeks . Fortunately two of the children were getting free lunches in school , she said . The rent was $23 a month , plus $1.20 for extra utilities and 50 cents for " pest control . " The baby 's diapers required " decent soap , " and there were pencils and crayons to be bought for the three daughters of school age . There were only two beds ; the three girls , Mrs. Gutierrez explained , " slept crosswise " on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 10 children in another tiny flat . She , too , was getting the maximum $123 monthly welfare payment , out of which she had to invest $58 to get $128 worth of food stamps , and pay $39 rent . That left only $26 for all other expenses . The family subsisted mainly on tortillas and beans . Three of the children had no shoes . Nothing infuriates a MexicanAmerican more than to have some Anglo suggest to him that all his troubles would vanish if he would only stop eating beans and tortillas and get on a " balanced diet . " " If you have one dollar , " exThe New York Times Feb. 19 , 1969 Cross-hatched area defines Navajo reservation , which surrounds Hopi Indian land . plained Father Ruiz patiently , " and you can buy either one pound of meat or 10 pounds of pinto beans , what are you going to buy ? You are going to fill the stomachs of your kids with beans . And they call this ignorance ! " I 'd like to meet the home economist who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month ! It would take a genius to survive on that amount of money . " He said he had been asked to appear on a television show called " Buen Apetito , " an educational program intended to get Mexicans off starch . He had told the producers that the idea was preposterous : the poor simply did not have the means to buy the " balanced " foods . Downtown , Albeit A. Pena Jr. , a Mexican-American member of the Bexar ( San Antonio ) County Commission , said he believed there were " 100,000 hungry people " in Bexar ( pronounced Bear ) which has a population of about 800,000 ( 48 per cent Mexican-American , 40 per cent Anglo , 12 per cent Negro ) . They are hungry , he said , because San Antonio is a " a cheap-labor town  --  about onethird of the wage earners earn less than the accepted poverty level of $3,000 a year . " Cites Mexican Pride Yet Anglos , he said , cling to the myth best expressed last year by a state welfare official : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and she 'll still feed her children beans and tortillas . " " This is a base canard and he knows it , " Commissioner Pena said . Many Mexican-Americans are too proud to admit they can not feed their children properly , Father Ruiz explained , and are bruised by the coldness of welfare personnel . So " cells " have been set up in the housing project to detect and report families in trouble . Rummage sales and bingo parties are held to assist the unfortunate . Texas was the first state to complete a nutrition study of its low-income population for a national survey by the United States Public Health Service . The findings confirmed the presence of serious malnutrition among the Mexican-American , Anglo-American and Negro poor . In the lower Rio Grande Valley , the investigators discovered an infant suffering from marasmus and another afflicted with what Dr. William M. , one of the directors of the survey , called " pre-kwashiorkor . " The findings of malnutrition and of evidence of growth retardation among children gave some substance to an earlier report by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families in San Antonio . Dr. Peirce , who is an associate professor at the Worden School of Social Service of Our Lady of the Lake College , directed a staff of students and faculty in interviews with 967 adults and 561 children , most of them Mexican-Americans . The findings were somber . Of the children studied , 272 , or nearly half , were judged as having an inadequate diet . A total of 650 , or 67 per cent of the adults , had inadequate food intake in the 24 hours preceding the interview . Some critics challenged the validity of Dr. Peirce 's survey . Dr. Peirce said he had " great conviction " that it was reliable . He was pleased that the preliminary report of the National Nutrition Survey tended to support his bleak picture of diet inadequacy . But he said he was disturbed by a tendency to " explain away " the exposed malnutrition as the product of " ignorance . " " Let 's face it , " he said . " People are hungry because they are poor . " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of converting from a pastoral living to a cash economy . Traditionally , the Navajos have been sheep and goat herders . But the land is arid ( " it takes 10 lousy acres to graze one sheep , " Dr. Van Duzen explained ) and the population has grown so rapidly mostly for women . For most , of the population poverty seems to have deepened . The average Navajo sees about $400 in cash a year , including welfare payments . Dr. Van Duzen said there were many families with no visible income who were kept alive by charity from their clan . " I 'm not saying Navajos are dropping dead of starvation , " she said , " but there is hunger ? and it should n't happen in the United States . " In the children 's ward , Dr. Van Duzen observed Navajo infants who she feared had suffered irreversible brain damage from undernourishment The babies were gaining weight , but some still showed growth retardation . Dr. Van Duzen noted a three-month-old-baby described as " marasmic , " whose flesh hung loose , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and legs . She said she was convinced that many were permanently stunted by hunger . " Some say these are small little kids that wo n't grow because they are Navajos , " she said . " I say these are small little kids that wo n't grow because they have n't got food . " At Many Farms , Dr. Robert Roessel , Jr. , president of Navajo Community College , the reservation 's first junior college , called malnutrition one of the most acute obstacles for Indian children in classrooms . Attention Limited " They look weak and gaunt to begin with , " he said . " Their attention span is abnormally limited . " He charged that some public school superintendents prided themselves on virtually eliminating free lunches for Indian children . They did this , he said , on the mistaken notion that they were " teaching the Navajos responsibility and helping the children adjust to the world in which they live . " But they were driving away Indian children unable to pay $1.50 a week for lunches , he said . The community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board . Six board members have never been to school and the seventh has only a second-grade education . Yet Dr. Roessel said the involvement of Indian parents in the operation of the school had eliminated so many tensions and hostilities that the students were already showing marked improvement in achievement rates . Impoverished Navajos , he said , received free food under the commodities distribution program . But the commodities available were " woefully inadequate " and " did n't begin to meet the need . " At Window Rock , capital of the Navajo nation , Dr. Bock , the health service director , spoke of some of the difficulties of administering health over the vast reservation with a small , overworked staff . 30-Mile Walk With Baby He told of a woman who had walked 30 miles from her hogan , the traditional circular hut made of cedar logs and mud , to the nearest traveled road , carrying a sick baby . He had been urging the train- , ing of at least 110 Navajos as local health aides who would teach certain basic health practices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project had finally been allocated , he said , but only for the training of 35 to 40 Indians . Dr. Bock mentioned one promising development  --  the provision , since Christmas , of supplementary rations for infants and pregnant or lactating mothers who obviously were malnourished . Doctors were authorized to fill out prescriptions for food , he explained , just as though they were issuing prescriptions for medicine . And the Office of Economic Opportunity has provided $42,000 for the purchase of a special baby formula fortified with Vitamins A , C and D , niacin , riboflavin , thiamin , calcium , phosphorous and iron to be given to premature babies . Unfortunately a year 's supply of the formula costs $308 , so only about 130 infants , or just about half of the 250 to 300 premature babies born each year on the Navajo reservation , will be taken care of .
