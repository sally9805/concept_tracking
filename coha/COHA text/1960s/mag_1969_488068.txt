DEAR SrRs " Labor and Foreign Policy " by Ronald Radosh The Nation , Sept. 81 is full of unstated and questionable assumptions , half-truths , and pseudo-sophisticated misunderstandings T shall skeptically await some documentation in what you indicate is to be . a forthcoming book One general key to the inadequacy of Radosh 's analysis Is to be found in his characterization of the mainstream of the American labor movement as " corporate unionism " This seems to him to mean that the unions are perverted creatures of and controlled by American corporations , rather than properly dedicated to overthrowing the individual enterprise 01 capitalistic system While Arne ! ican unions have " accepted " capitalism , worked within it , and worked to humanize and restrict it ( both through collective bargaining and political means ) , their actual goals and programs are not that different from the Socialist unions of most of the Western European countries today , except for France and Italy As for American unions generally going along with U S foreign policy one can as readily fault the labor movements in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well An ideologically united world labor movement is impractical , I believe , though Radosh seems to assume there should be one Phillips I Garman Professor of Labor and Industrial Relations University of Illinois New YorA City DEAR Sias Mr Garman both defends and denies the existence of corporate unionism The basic purpose of unionism is to protect the interests of wage earners economic , social and political Corporate union leaders reveal their limitations when they fail to wage fights for crucial demands , whenever these demands conflict with the limits of reform set by the large corporations and government spokesmen During World War I , Samuel Gompers decided not to call for an eight-hour day , because Newton D Baker and Woodrow Wilson defined that demand as revolutionary " ... During Woild War II , Sidney Hillman supported FDR 's use of the Army to bust the North American Aviation strike , since it interfered with the defense effort The corporate- unionists proved all too willing to abandon their original commitment to the workeis when they were told not to rock the boat These and other points will indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly be true that the goals and program of American unions diffei little from those of most West European Socialist unions , or for that matter , the Communist unions of France and Italy . But all of these bodies are social-democratic , and follow a similar corporate orientation In May of 1968 , the French CGT thus worked to curb revolutionary demands for workers ' control of production and occupation of factories , and tried to channel the workers ' momentum into traditional trade union considerations it was this essential conservatism of the CP unions , in fact , that Irving Brown played upon when he skillfully manipulated to create a split in their ranks As for an " ideologically united world labor movement , " it was exactly the desire of Jay Lovestone that all labor follow the path set out by the AFL leaders creation of a world labor movement pledged to the line of the State Department . . . Ronald Radosh correction We regret the misspelling of the word dirigisme in last week 's review by Emile Capouya of Leo Huberman and Paul Sweezy 's Socialism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for love , sympathy and unqualified support , Lyndon B. Johnson pleaded , " I 'm the only President you 've got . " It was the American version of the " cult of personality , " and it failed . Now this wrongheaded view of the democratic process is being raised again , by a chorus of diverse types Hubert Humphrey , having said quite distinctly at the Midwest Democratic Conference that Mr. Nixon 's honeymoon was over , informs us after a nice talk with Dick that " we have only one President at a time . " David S. Broder , who nowadays is the voice of the Establishment among political commentators , does a piece about how easy and wicked it is to " break " the President This theme is picked up m the House , and Dean Acheson warns us of a major constitutional crisis " if we make a habit of destroying Presidents " This " breaking the President " bogy needs to be looked at both in general and in the current situation Most of us were taught to respect the office of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether or not the second is possible depends more on the President than on its Every President enjoys an enormous lead time of approval and support and can count on great backlogs of public favor if he knows how to make a halfway intelligent and honest appeal to the public These are the facts we must start with Long before he reached the White House , Mr. Nixon gave many Americans what they regard as good reason to distrust him So he assumed the Presidency under a cloud of political and partisan misgivings as to his sincerity  --  even that measure of sincerity an active politician is expected to exhibit Yet both the public and the politicians gave him the benefit of the doubt . He could not possibly complain that he did not enjoy an extended " honeymoon . " His detractors remained silent and the press leaned over backward to be fair So the long summer days passed at San Clemente , with the mood of the country seemingly quiet and serene We suggested at that time that the Administration was misjudging the underlying temper of the people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of confidence the President has only himself to blame . As a candidate he made promises which as President he did not keep . That is scarcely a novel failing , but in Mr. Nixon 's case the promises were so sweeping and direct that a total failure to live up to them could not go unobserved " The next President , " Mr. Nixon declared , " must take an activist view of his office . He must articulate the nation 's values , define its goals and marshal its will Under a Nixon administration , the Presidency will be involved in the entire sweep of America 's public concerns . " This and other statements of purpose have been blandly ignored . Mr Nixon has never been strong on principle , and political tricks and posturing do not suffice He has not been candid , his press secretary is the least informative in recent history , and his director of communications seems to view his job as that of running an advertising agency . Three months were allowed to go by without a press conference It is little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacked leadership . Yet , having to such an extent isolated himself , Mr. Nixon in effect asks us to continue to trust him blindly As one example , having made only token departures from his predecessor 's policy toward Vietnam , he bids the country be patient while with the help of President Thaeu , whom he cited as one of the world 's great statesmen , he brings us an " honorable " peace . Still other considerations explain the country 's rising impatience . According to the textbooks and hoary tradition , the President is the best informed , if not the wisest , of men in public life . On the same theory , he gets the best advice . But is he , and does he ? Consider Dean Acheson 's exhortation In the same breath in which he tells us to back the President and keep quiet , he also tells us that President Johnson was badly briefed and got the wrong intelligence evaluations ; moreover that he , Acheson , had to tap second-echelon personnel to learn the hard facts he needed to advise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Acheson and others had not shaken him out of his complacency , Johnson might have continued to escalate the war . Is Mr. Nixon any better informed ? Can Lodge and Bunker give him better advice than they gave Johnson ? Is he reading the public mind any better than Johnson did before the ax fell9 Could anything be more maladroit than Mr Nixon 's declaration that " under no circumstances whatever " would he be affected by demonstrations and protests , followed by evidence that he is affected to the extent of throwing General Hershey to his critics , Issuing transparently dishonest data on draft calls and , in the view of some observers , going into a flurry of overreaction to the October 15 moratorium ? There is no fault in the Presidency that could not be cured by qualities of real principle and leadership in the incumbent . If he does n't get the support he feels he deserves , he should ask himself why What has he done that was wrong , what has he failed to do that would have been right ' The finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Effect Critics of the American mode of decision making tend to overlook one significant fact . The country is culturally diverse It operates of different levels of understanding , of reference , of assumptions . Precisely because tt is that kind of country , opinion on complex issues forms slowly . On the surface not much seems to be happening , or it all seems pointed in one direction , with little counter-movement . Then a dissent starts , matures slowly at first , then often staggers everyone by emerging explosively as a near-majority opinion . From there it has only a little way to go and it is the majority opinion . Everyone is appropriately surprised and forgets the phenomenon until next time . Why is the peculiar way in which opinion forms in this country so often forgotten ? Why is it that normally bright individuals , even those supposedly expert in public relations , so consistently fail to spot the cloud that is no bigger than a man 's fist9 I. F. Stone notes that " when Howard Zinn in The Nation a few years ago first proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political leper . " ( " Vietnam : The Logic of Withdrawal , " The Nation , February 6 , 1967 . ) " Leper " is perhaps too strong a term , but certainly there was no mad rush to join the " withdrawal now " forces , such as they were . But today Zinn has an army at his back ; in one form or another almost everyone is for withdrawal . The question is how . The Nation is attuned to this problem because we live by it . When Fred J. Cook wrote " Juggernaut : The Warfare State , " it seemed quite unlikely that in a few years his handling of the military-industrial complex would become a journalistic clich ? , with everyone Joining the act , falling dyer themselves to repeat what Cook had said ? and often unaware that he had said it first . The Establishment , so-called , could save itself a lot of time , energy and money by reading the small-circulation journals of critical opinion . It would not have to adopt their views , only use them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always prophetic , but a few days of research would convince anyone that they forecast what is to come far oftener than do the big-circulation media . The basic reason is that the big fellows live for today 's circulation and advertising . The big journals will continue to do what they have always done . But what of the politicians ? They certainly would benefit , at no risk whatever , from reading the low-circulation papers , which is where the ideas are spawned and the movements begin . Essentially , Mr. Nixon is in trouble because throughout his political career he has identified foresight with bigness . John F. Kennedy was the last President who did pay a little attention to the " intellectual " press ; but he made his decisions  --  the Bay of Pigs , for instance  --  on other premises . Mr. Nixon has a chance to do better , but the chances are he wo n't . ' Custeristic ' IVtark Rudd , leader of the Weatherman faction now in control of the national SDS , justifies his policy of seeking violent confrontation by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take risks , take some of the damages , of the costs , off the backs of black people and Third-World people , and do some damage . " But when the Weathermen demonstrated in Chicago earlier this month , in rivalry with rallies held by the moderate wing of the now-sundered SDS , it was the latter whose meeting was co-sponsored by the Black Panthers and the Puerto Rican Young Lords . And Fred Hampton , Illinois chairman of the Black Panthers , denounced the Weathermen as " anarchistic , opportunistic and Custeristic . " That last epithet is significant , for Custer is scarcely a symbol of racial fraternity , and It focuses on what is most wrong about the Rudd approach to world problems . The Weatherman faction is made up of a body of middle-class youth  --  now rather wickedly seeking to enlist high school children as their shock troops  --  who have generated within themselves a sense of guilt from privilege . which they would now expiate by leading the oppressed races of the world to revolutionary victory . Considering the comparative numbers involved , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of revolutionary abortions And the black , brown and ycllow races have had enough of elitism . The Weathermen have adopted an ominously vague slogan : " Bring the war home . " If it means anything , it threatens a state of such violent chaos in the States that the military will be forced to withdraw their regiments from Vietnam to curb the destruction here . A country which imposes order by military force is necessarily a dictatorship . It may be that Rudd sees the road to freedom and Justice as passing through tyranny , and it may be that he can persuade high school students to agree with him . But he will not persuade blacks , Mexicans and Puerto Ricans , who have knowledge of suppression and need not invent ways of living dangerously . In a sense the Weathermen are right to decry their privileges and to denounce their schooling . They know themselves to be the sons and daughters of the Middle Class , in whose name all authority in this country asserts its legitimacy . They expect to pay for their deeds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculate that the payment is itself the first step toward their goal ( " just the fact that we are willing to fight the police is a political victory " ) ; but what if the strategy proves wrong , if victory can not be won in the name of Che Guevara ? When a Weatherman takes off his football helmet and his denim jacket , he becomes a white kid headed uptown . What can a black kid take off ? And this attempt to equate the Jungles of Latin America with the industrialized cities of the North , to find parallels between a peasant population and a unionized , affluent working class , suggests that their teachers have not shown these youths how to draw analogies . They have heard the despairing voice of Marcuse ; they have not grasped ' the power of the syllogism America . it is Just possible , can be mobilized to repudiate the futile policies that have deranged its values in the last thirty years But America can not possibly be led by the nose by a group of ill-informed youths shouting irrelevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they achieved the almost impossible task of making Mayor Daley 's police look like public servants . And in Chicago they broke the neck of a city official . By that one act they compromised , at least for a time , the whole protest movement in America . Viva Curran ! The high point of the National Maritime Union 's fifteenth convention , held in New York earlier this month , was the almost unanimous vote , to ringing applause , whereby the 475 delegates of the 50.000 members pocketed $525 apiece in " subsistence , " plus first-class roundtrip-fares , for spending fourteen hours in three days at the Commodore Hotel . The first order of business was the appointment of all committees by Joseph Curran , who has been president of the NMU during its entire thirty-three years . All resolutions must pass through these committees , and only those recommended may be discussed . To delegates who complained that their resolutions had been ignored , Curran replied , " New subjects come up under New Business . " But the catch to that TILE NATION/ October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching New Business , Curran announced ? " And so we come to the end of this convention . " The delegates promptly adjourned . Curran 's aim this year was to legitimize a presidential decree by which he had taken the NMU away from the seamen  --  whom he can no longer control  --  and established his machine anew on a catchall membership . Thus 7,500 brassiere and shoe employees , gravediggers , car salesmen and Panamanian workers can now vote on seamen 's contracts and for the officials who will service vessels from New York to Yokohama . In the NMU the entire membership votes for every officer . Those who can vote , that is . By requiring that seamen accumulate 800 days of sea time , the NMU relegates 40 per cent of its maritime members ( all of whom pay $160 a year in " service fees " ) to second-class status , with neither voice nor vote . Meanwhile , shoreside workers are given their NMU books on the spot . James Morrissey , leader of the opposition , suggested that seamen and land workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was a criticism of Curran 's empire and , while criticism may be seen elsewhere as a sign of organizational good health , in the NMU it is considered treason . Curran castigated the dozen or so members of the opposition as " lower than scum . . . paid provocateurs . " And Morrissey was given no chance to reply . Curran has a tremendous machine with unlimited funds . It pays him a salary of $92,050 , it supplies him with a limousine and pays its chauffeur $18,048 , and it is setting aside for his retirement a plum of $650,000 . There is just one buzzing anxiety to disturb the emperor 's repose : all that power and affluence depend on the patient silence of 50,000 members . And each of those workers has a brain in his head . ( See " Curran 's NMU " by Dorian J. Fliegel , The Nation , January 30 , 1967 . ) Once the Headlines Vanished Rep. Paul Findley ( R. , Ill ) has been struggling for years to put a $20,000 ceiling on annual price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in getting the limitation written into the House bill by a vote of 224 to 142 , largely because , on a state by state , county by county basis , he was able to correlate hunger statistics ? " hunger " was in the May headlines because of Sen. George McGovern 's investigations  --  with large subsidy payments . But the Senate deleted the limitation , as we predicted it would ( " The Sweet Smell of Subsidy " ; The Nation , June 16 ) , and last week efforts to restore it failed by the close vote of 177 to 181 . The measure now goes to conference and Mr. Findley will have a final chance this year to achieve his objective when the House considers the conference report . Actually he had the necessary votes , but when the leaders of both parties learned how the House would vote , strong pressure was applied to get ten Congressmen  --  each leadership delivered five  --  to vote against the measure . The Republican leadership wanted to please the states and interests that benefit from large subsidy payments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agriculture Committee , who last year pocketed more than $100,000 in subsidy payments from his cotton operations The Democratic leadership felt compelled to obey the desires of such committee chairmen as Poage ( Texas ) Agriculture , Mahon ( Texas ) Appropriations , Teague ( Texas ) Veterans Affairs , Rivers ( South Carolina ) Armed Services , and CoImes ( Mississippi ) Rules . Once the hunger headlines had vanished , the N-partisan squeeze play could be carried out backstage . Not That Simple The Department of Health , Education and Welfare is in trouble over its blacklisting of scientists ( see editorial , " ' Security ' in HEW , " The Nation , July 28 ) and , unlike the CIA and the military , it is not in a position to hush up scandal on grounds of national security . A panel headed by the departmental Under Secretary , John G. Veneman , Jr. , is investigating . A suit has been filed in Federal District Court in Boston to compel the department to make public its files on persons , including many prominent scientists , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HEW administrator says , " The whole security business in the department is a mess and has been for years . " Richard D. Lyons of The New York Times obtained one blacklist , compiled by the National Institute of Mental Health ( mental health ! ) listing the names of forty-eight " ineligible " scientists . Estimates of the total number of proscribed scientists range from 200 to 500 . Yet several former Secretaries ? Abraham A. Ribicoff , Anthony J. Celebrezze and Wilbur J. Cohen  --  whose word can not be doubted , say that they never heard anything about blacklisting in all their years in the department . When one reflects on the varieties of skulduggery that permeate large , complex organizations , this obliviousness at the top is quite plausible . Moreover , only a fraction of what has been going on may be brought to light by the unearthing of a few blacklists And the tangible blacklists may have done less harm than those blacklists  --  or " graylists " ? which were never reduced to writing . In the government , especially , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind when surveying a situation of this sort . A prudent subordinate is likely to refrain from calling a Cabinet officer 's attention to something which it might embarrass him to know . Down at the lower levels the rule is : when in doubt , do n't put this or that scientist on an advisory panel . True , he might make the panel more effective , but if it should turn out that he has displeased some Congressman with his views on the Vietnamese War or one of a dozen other " controversial " issues , there could be trouble for the functionary who failed to bar him . Some blacklists exist only in the heads of people of this kind , based perhaps on mere suspicion or hearsay . The Veneman panel has an important and difficult job ahead of it . The cure lies not only in investigation but in the hope that more Secretaries and administrators will insist on knowing more of what goes on in their departments , encourage input of information from below , cultivate relations with the press ( particularly the critical press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the pitfalls of every bureaucratic setup . 429
