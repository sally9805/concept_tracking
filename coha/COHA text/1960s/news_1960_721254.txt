txt New York , May 24 ? The text of the speech delivered to the United Nations security council by British Delegate Pierson Dixon follows : " I listened with close attention to the statements made to the council yesterday by the distinguished foreign minister of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Bistinguished representative of the United States on the item which has been brought before the council by the Soviet Union . " The distinguished foreign minister of the Soviet Union sought to concentrate our attention on the particular incident of the U-2 complaint and on the implications of that incident in soviet eyes . I must say that the account which he gave of these implic.ations seemed to me considerably exaggerated . Calls Talk Inadeq:aite " But my main feeling on listening to Mr. Gromyko was that he did not adequately explain the reasons which led the soviet government to disrupt the summit conference on this issue . In your opening remarks yesterday afternoon you , Mr. President , sought to set our discussion round this table in the context of the present international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the summit conference . " If I may say so thought that your wise words were a reflection of the way , in which most of us regard this debate . The soviet government is surely aware of the hopes which the people of the world placed .111 the recent meeting in Paris . There seemed to be a real chance of overcoming of the fears and lack of confidence of the past , and of moving forward towards a solution of some of the problems which divide the world . These hopes were deeply felt by both the government and the people of the United Kingdom . " However strong the feelings which the incident of the 0-2 plane may have aroused , or have been whipped up to arouse , in the Soviet Union , we can not agree that the Soviet Union was justified in bringing to nothing a conference on which so much depended . " I now turn to the soviet complaint . I am bound to say in parenthesis that this complaint comes somewhat strangely from the Soviet Union , whose widespread activities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complaint has been made it ' is the responsibility of the council to examine not only the incident complained of but also the political facts which form its background . Notes 2 Basic Facts " In our view , two of the political facts which the council must take into account are the following . " First , since the end of the second World war a marked lack of confidence has existed between the two major power groups , on whom rests a great responsibility for the peace of the world . I do not intend today to analyse the causes of this lack of trust , I simply point out that its existence must affect our discussion . The policies of any nation must necessarily be affected by the degree of trust which it feels towards those with whom it has to deal . " Now Mr. Gromyko in his speech yesterday . brought very widespread charges of aggressive intent in connection with the incident of the U-2 . In the draft resolution read out at the end of his speech and now introduced as document S/4321 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. action as aggressive . Praises Lodge Feely . " Mr. Lodge yesterday disposed very effectively of these charges . Certainly it is my view that the distinguished foreign minister of the , Soviet Union entirely failed to make out a case for branding the act as aggressive . It must he perfectly clear to us all that this act involved no use of force or threat of the use of force against the Soviet Union . As to the more widespread charges of aggressive intent to which I referred a moment ago , it is relevant , in order to put the whole matter in perspective , to remind members of the council that the North Atlantic Treaty alliance was brought into being only in 1949 after the western powers had to a very great extent disarmed after World War II , as a purely defensive alliance in reaction to the policies at that time of the Soviet Union in Germany and Czechoslovakia . " No Aggressive Intent " The same considerations apply to the nature of the central treaty organization ; These defensive alliances never have had , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never , could have aggressive intentions . This background must be borne in mind , Mr. President , in assessing the true value Of Mr. Gromyko 's charges about aggressive intent . There is certainly no aggressive ? intent on the western side , and it is our hope , which we have in the last year or two had some encouragement to believe may be well founded that there is none , at any rate in the military sense , on the other side . " This , however , does not alter the fact that a state of confidence between the two groups has not existed . It is only realistic to acknowledge that this fact must affect the policies and actions of governments on whom rests the responsibility to protect their people against the dangers of the modern world . Science 2d Point I come now to the second political fact which we in this council should take into account . It , is this . The advance of science has led us into a situation in which war of the most destructive and terrible kind can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single command or the pressing of a single button . " These two facts , the lack of confidence among the great powers of the world and , the progress of the science of destruction , have led to a greatly increased fear of surprise attack . Both the United States in December , 1941 , , and the Soviet Union in June , 1941 , suffered the consequences of a surprise attack . " Everybody knows that the risks are much greater and the consequences would be much more terrible today than they were in 1941 . It is not therefore surprising that the major powers have felt it necessary to spend mach energy in seeking to protect themselves and their allies against surprise attack . " One of these means of protection is the collection of intelligence , a means which , as the distinguished representative of the United States has illustrated , has been so widely employed by the ' Soviet Union . Such incidents as that of the U-2 plane over the Soviet Union can not therefore be treated as if it had occurred in the 18th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political and scientific realities of 1960 . This incident therefore should be treated as a symptom of the fear of surprise attack : It is the root cause arther than the sympH ton which we should try to remove . " This is why her majesty 's government have in all their approaches to the disarmament problem attached such great importance to making a beginning with a system of international control and inspection . We consider that the key to the problem of east-west relations is the establishment of confidence , and have believed that agreement on measures , . even modest measures of control and inspection could lead to a growth of confidence , which eventually would make possible the really comprehensive measures necessary to eliminate the fear of surprise attack . Several Proposals Made " Together with the governments of France , the United States and others , we have put ' forward a series of proposals to this end . Unfortunately these proposals have . not met with a helpful response from the soviet side . In November , 1958 , a conference of experts was held in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precautions which could be taken against surprise attack . Unfortunately this conference came to nothing . " We have not , however , been deterred from making further proposals . In his speech to the General Assembly on Sept. 17 , 1959 , Mr. Selwyn Lloyd proposed that ' We should follow up the not very successful conference of experts . on measures against surprise attack with a further conference to consider the political as well as the technical aspects of this particular problem . " " On March 16 , 1960 , a joint plan for comprenhensive disarmament was tabled by the delegations of Canada , France , Italy , the United Kingdom , and the Unite d States at the conference of the 10 nation committee on disarmament in Geneva . Points of Proposal Among other things , this plan proposed that " joint studies should be undertaken immediately on measures to give participating s t at es greater protection against surprise attack with effective verification procedures , including aerial inspection , ground observance at agreed points , mobile ground teams , overlapping radar , notification of aircraft flights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it is fair to say that if some such plan had been in operation the incident which we are now discussing would not have occurred . And that the best means for ensuring that such incidents are not repeated would be for the Soviet Union to cooperate in the establishment of some such international arrangement as the western powers proposed at Geneva . " Great Day for Peace " " It would be a great day for the peace of the world if the Soviet Union , which in many ways has made such great contributions to modern advances in s c i en c e , could bring itself to show imagination in the sphere of international relations equal to the inventiveness it has shown in the realm of science . The salvation of world peace really hinges in the 20th century on the constructive matching of political ideas with the scientific potentialities which have outrun the century . " To conclude , Mr. President , her Majesty 's government in the United Kingdom can only regret the manner in which the Soviet Union has chosen to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret that the Soviet Union decided to destroy on this issue the arrangements for the summit conference , on which the nations of the world had built so much hope . They persisted in this course even after President Eisenhower had given a categorical assurance that the aircraft flights had already been suspended arid were not to be resumed . Breakdown Inevitable " This assurance was the most categorical and definite which any President of the United States could constitutionally give . By refusing to accept this assurance and pressing further humiliating demands on the United States , which could not reasonably be accepted , the Soviet Union made the breakdown of the conference inevitable before it even began . " The United Kingdom and its allies do not intend to be deterred by the breakdown of the summit conference from the search for solutions ' to the problems which divide the world . In the communique issued on ' May 17 the governments of France , the United Kingdom , and the United States stated . that they remained unshaken in their conviction that all outstanding international questions should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but by peaceful means thru negotiations . They themselves remained ready to take part in such negotiations at any suit- , able time in the future . ' Support , " Significant " . " It is significant that when the British prime minister , Mr. Macmillan , reported ? to the House of Commons on May 20 on - the breakdown of the summit conference , his statement of the policy of her majesty 's government was welcomed in all parts of the house . The leader of the opposition , M r . Gaitskell , said ' I am sure that the prime minister is right in implying in his statement that we should not make any change in our general approach and policy . Our policy must surely remain as , before always ready and anxious to secure and negotiate agreements while at the same time maintaining our defenses and alliances . ' " We hope that on reflection the Soviet Union will decide to resume with us the search for lasting solutions to the problems of the world end especially to the problems which cause distrust and incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a fruitful outcome of both the conference on nuclear tests and the 10 power conference on disarmanent which continue in Geneva . Science Changes Methods " The events of the last few weeks have emphasized that satisfactory security from the appalling prospects of modern war can not be achieved by the isolated efforts of any one power or group of powers . The new developments in science have rendered the old conceptions and methods out of date . Only satisfactory international arrangements for security commensurate with the discoveries of scionce , can provide the international confidence essential for peaceful and harmonious relationships between nations . " We had hoped that negotiations at the summit would give an impulse in that direction . That the need is urgent has been brought home to us all by the recent unfortunate developments . That is why her majesty 's government are determined to do all - in their power to ensure that the progress towards . a solution of these problems which had recently begun , should be resumed and accelerated as soon as possible .
