People have suspected for years that somewhere in that grand French personality there was a touch of fighting Irish blood . Now French and Irish genealogists can prove it . And who should it be that Charles de Gaulle , 74 , hails back to but Rudricus the Great , who ruled Ireland with might and main for 70 years before he died in 219 B.C. His descendants took the name MacCartan , and in 1711 , a MacCartan emigrated from the Auld Sod to France where he married convent-educated Susanne Decoetlogon , who bore him five children , one of whom turned out to be De Gaulle 's **28;14870;TOOLONG on his mother 's side . <P> <P> It was the kind of award that can wreck a girl 's image in the movies these days . So no wonder Elke Sommer , 24 , said she was " very surprised " when the California Fashion Designers decided to name her the " best-dressed star of 1965 . " Elke recovered quickly enough to say graciously that she was also " very flattered and very thrilled . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she continued thoughtfully , " I got all the publicity when I did n't wear them . " <P> <P> Up into New Mexico 's Sandia Mountains went three forest rangers , a local lawyer , and Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas , 66 , there for a quick refresher course in outdoor living . At 10,000 ft. , the view from the top was " splendid , " but on the way down through Cibola National Forest , bitter cold , high winds and 15-ft. drifts from a sudden snowstorm turned the nightwalk into a nightmare . It took them nine hours instead of the usual five to negotiate six miles on snowshoes , edging their way down the steep switchback trails sideways like crabs . " We all had spills , " said a weary Douglas when the party reached safety . " You learn to walk that canyon with great respect . " But just the same , " Mrs. Douglas and I are coming out in the summer . " <P> <P> " I guess it was 1961 or 1962 , " monotoned Marlon Brando @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was awakened by the girl I was with . Then I saw Anna . " Anna , of course , was Actress Anna Kashfi , 30 , his recently divorced wife , and she had broken into his house . " She started pulling the girl 's hair out , " drawled Brando . " I let her do it . I thought it would be good for her to get it out of her system . " Now Brando wanted to get their son , Christian Devi , 6 , out of Anna 's hands and was fighting her in a Los Angeles court for custody of the boy . Under crossexamination , Marlon readily admitted that both Anna and his second wife , Mexican Actress Movita , were pregnant when he married them , and that he also had a son by a Tahitian beauty whom he did n't marry . The judge decided that Marlon 's methods were mere " shortcomings " compared to Anna 's " reliance on drugs and alcohol , " therefore awarded custody of the youngster to Brando . Cried Anna , dashing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Where the hell was Marlon Brando when the child was being reared ? " Rhetorical question . <P>
