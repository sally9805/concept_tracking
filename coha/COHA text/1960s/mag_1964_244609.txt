The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is soberly known as the Government agency that ensures bank accounts up to $10,000-but that is only part of its job . Organized 30 years ago , when Depression-hit banks were closing at the rate of 4,000 a year , it has since liquidated the assets of several hundred failed banks , often picking up unusual properties in the process . One of the most unusual came into the agency 's possession when it took over $106,000 in mortgages on a small and sleazy hotel in Houston after the First National Bank of Marlin , Texas , failed in March . What the FDIC has on its hands , it seems , is a brothel . <P> Until this year , the stuffy FDIC would probably never have admitted to such ownership . But the atmosphere has changed under new Chairman Joseph W. Barr , 46 , a Harvard-trained economist and former Indiana Congressman who was Lyndon Johnson 's first executive appointment . " Banking is a flesh-and-blood business , " says curly-haired Joe Barr , " and there 's no sense pretending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have played in the failure of the $3.8 million Marlin bank , Barr is trying to get back some of the blood ; the FDIC has filed a $1.2 million civil suit charging that major stockholders of the bank misappropriated funds . <P> Barr is less disturbed by his odd properties than by the fact that the Marlin bank failure illustrates what may be a trend . Most banks over the years since the Depression have gone under either because officers embezzled funds or showed poor judgment in making loans . But the four banks that have failed in the past 16 months had each been acquired by new management just before failure . Barr fears that unprincipled operators may be taking over small banks , paying themselves inflated salaries to recover acquisition costs , and then selling risky loan paper to their own banks . Barr aims to stop such practices , perhaps with new legislation and certainly with a sharper eye on the nation 's banks . <P> All this may slow but surely will not eliminate the flow of unlikely acquisitions . The FDIC has taken over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California banker with embezzled funds , has also held resort hotels , antiques , furs and whisky warehouses . Occasionally the agency is even able to operate such enterprises more profitably than the original owners . It turned an abandoned Idaho gold mine into a tourist attraction , and still owns a Texas oilfield that earns $3,000 monthly .
