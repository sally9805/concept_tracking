For depriving him of that luxuriant handlebar mustache , the Air Force clearly owed Colonel Robin Olds , 45 , a favor . But four stars ? Yet there they were , stuck to his chair when he arrived at the Air Force Academy to take over as commandant of cadets &shy; put there , it turned out , to represent the four Communist MIGs Robin had shot down over Viet Nam . As for that other fighter pilot 's badge-the one the brass told him to polish off with a razor because cadets ca n't wear them - he may not have been the only one inconvenienced . Reported Olds : " I 've heard a rumor the cadets had got hold of 3,000 false mustaches . " <P> <P> He dashed off to join the Marines as a private at 18 , saw a lot of China before mustering out as a first lieutenant in 1946 and used to relax by racing sports cars . Is that the profile of a chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers ? Well , in the case of Daniel Parker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were lots of other credentials-like a Harvard Business School diploma ( ' 49 ) , directorships of four companies , and 17 years spent working at Parker , the last seven as chairman , during which time sales increased 33% . So when the N.A.M . needed a new chairman of its own last week , Parker sounded like just the man - and at 42. he becomes the youngest ever to hold the post . <P> <P> What better outfit to pick for a meeting with Charles de Gaulle than a snappy little soldier suit , complete with gold-braided lapels and epaulets ? And that 's just what Actress Brigitte Bardot , 33 , stepped into for a show folk get-together at the Elysee Palace . Le General was smitten . " We are enchanted to see you-enchanted is the word , " saluted France 's President . " I liked Viva Maria very much . " " But you saw it ? " ventured a flustered BB . " Yes , on television , " replied BB 's newest home-screen fan . <P> <P> Give ' em an inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standpatter against liberalizing practically anything . Witness Britain 's venerable Oxford Union , an all-male preserve for 142 years until it banned de sexo segregation in 1963 . Just four years later , the university debating society has elected a girl president . She is pert , brunette Seraldine Jones , 21 , daughter of a Liverpool schoolmaster and now heiress to an office once held by William Gladstone , Herbert Asquith and Ted Heath . There 'll be no nonsense about a counterattack either . " I trust that men who find my presence in the union disturbing , " said Geraldine , " will stay away . " <P>
