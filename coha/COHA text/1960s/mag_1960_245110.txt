A Journey to the Center of the Earth ( 20th Century-Fox ) . The year is 1880 . Professor Oliver Lindenbrook ( James Mason ) of the University of Edinburgh watches the sun rise over an extinct volcano in Iceland . What a splendid day for an outing ! Whereupon the professor brushes a speck of dust from his tweeds , adjusts his rucksack and deerstalker , stamps his stout shoes , grasps his walking stick and casually strolls off-to the center of the earth . Fortunately , he is followed by a Hollywood producer ( Charles Brackett ) with wit enough to smile at some of the most preposterous pseudo-scientific poppycock ever published by Jules Verne . And so what might easily have been just one more merely colossal ( $4,500,000 ) monster-movie comes off the reel as a grandly entertaining spoof of the boys ' book as it was written before the comic strips took over-the sort of kids ' picture that makes children gasp and parents grin . <P> As the hero forges onward and downward , square-jawed and indomitably prissy , his footsteps are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and loyally followed by four trite and true companions : a plucky youth ( Pat Boone ) , a good-natured giant ( Peter Ronson ) , a beautiful widow ( Arlene Dahl ) and a noble-souled duck named Gertrude . ( The widow , of course , is present over the hero 's most passionately prudish protests . " But madam , think ! " he gasps . " The lack of privacy ! " ) <P> The intrepid explorers scramble down volcanic chimneys , bathe in a grotto lined with glittering quartzes , stagger through regions of miasmal fumes and luminous algae , survive an attack by giant lizards , sail on a raft across an underground sea , get wrecked in the whirlpool that spins around the planet 's axis , stumble into sunken Atlantis , and finally are sucked into a volcanic vent and blown out the top of Mount Stromboli ( altitude : 3,040 ft. ) into the Tyrrhenian Sea . <P> Naturally , their clothes get somewhat rumpled in all the excitement , and after almost a year underground , the supply of bully beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine , ruddy complexion-zirconburn ? - and not once has anybody made an unseemly proposal to the heroine . As a matter of fact , not even the villain is very wicked . The worst thing he does on the whole trip : he eats the duck . <P> The sets are fun , and properly improbable . Not many of the situations in the script can be found in the book , but Scenarist Walter ( Titanic ) Reisch has at times improved on the master himself . Producer Brackett 's dialogue has a Vernal freshness and LIFE Science Writer Lincoln ( The World We Live In ) Barnett , retained as a technical adviser , has shrewdly inserted his scientific facts so as not to impair the general implausibility . On the whole , the film seems sure to enhance Author Verne 's reputation as the best dead writer Hollywood ever had . In the last five years three of his novels ( 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea , Around the World in 80 Days , From the Earth to the Moon ) have been made into movies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
