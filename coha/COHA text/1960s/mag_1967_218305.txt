The Red Guards may get their inspiration from Chairman Mao , but pro golfers swear by Norman Vincent Peale . South Africa 's Gary Player carries a copy of The Power of Positive Thinking around in his golf bag - and over the years has won the U.S. Open , the British Open , the Masters and the P.G.A . The newest advocate of Peale Power is Texan Gay Brewer Jr. , 35 , whose major claim to fame is that he has found more ways to lose tournaments than any other player in the game . <P> Brewer has finished second 14 times in his career . He did earn $75,000 last year , but the only tournament he won was the Pensacola Open - when Doug Sanders , who was leading by four strokes , forgot to sign his score card , and was disqualified . Last year , Brewer set some sort of record for frustration in the space of one week . He three-putted the 72nd hole in the Masters to blow a one-stroke lead , then lost the play-off to Jack Nicklaus ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes of Las Vegas ' Tournament of Champions , then lost the play-off to Arnold Palmer . <P> Think Green . Last week Brewer was back at the scene of disaster-the Mas ters-with a new swing ( " I 'm not forcing the ball any longer , I keep within myself " ) and a new philosophy : " I used to think negatively about my game . I do n't have that complex any more . I play offensive golf . I think positively . " Tuning up for the Masters , Gay had won the Pensacola Open for the second year in a row-impressively this time , firing a record 61 in the third round . But at Augusta the oddsmakers gave Brewer no better than a 10-to-l chance of beating the " Big Three " - Nicklaus , Palmer and Player-who among them had won seven straight Masters . <P> It was the oddest Masters in years . Complaining that the grass on Augusta 's fairways was too high . Player shot a first-round 75 and never got back into contention . Palmer had all kinds of trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Playing like any duffer , he staggered through a second-round 79 , missed the 36-hole cut , and joined the spectators-staying around the last two days only to perform the formality of helping the new champion into his winner 's blazer . <P> The blazer belonged to Brewer . On the last day , trailing Bobby Nichols , Julius Boros and Bert Yancey by two strokes , he wiped out that margin with three straight birdies on the 13th , 14th and 15th holes . When he trudged onto the 18th green to line up an 18-ft. putt , he was leading Nichols by one stroke , Yancey by four and Boros by five . Taking no chances , Gay lagged the ball to within 2 ft. of the hole , tapped in for a 67 and a 72-hole total of 280-eight under par-and went off to collect his $20,000 winner 's check from the original Master , Bobby Jones . " Actually , " Brewer confided to Jones , " I choked a little out there . " " No you did n't , " replied Bobby sternly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
