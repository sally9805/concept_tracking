This most excellent canopy , the air , look you , this brave o'erhanging firmament , this majestical roof fretted with golden fire-why it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors . <P> - Hamlet <P> This is just exactly the way that New York City 's air appeared to a ten-member Task Force on Air Pollution headed by Saturday Review Editor Norman Cousins . " New York City , " the task force reported , " pumps more poisons per square mile into its air than any other major city in the U.S. " <P> The pestilent congregation consists of 230,000 tons of soot , fly ash and other paniculate matter , 597,000 tons of sulphur dioxide , 298,000 tons of nitrogen oxides , 567,000 tons of hydrocarbons and 1,536,000 tons of carbon monoxide annually . It leaves every New Yorker with 730 Ibs. of pollutants to contend with every year . <P> Last year , the task force estimates , dirty air cost New Yorkers $500 million . Moreover , " all the ingredients now exist for an air-pollution disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New York City would be uninhabitable . " The biggest offender is the city government itself , whose eleven garbage incinerators alone spew forth some 39 tons of filth daily . The local utility , Consolidated Edison , is another major contributor , last year burned 10 billion Ibs. of soft coal and more than 800 million gals , of oil inside city limits . <P> There were heartening signs that New Yorkers were finally getting fed up with the foulness in the air . Only a week earlier , the New York City Council had unanimously passed the toughest air-pollution bill ever , including fines for violators ranging from $500 to $1,000 . The same week , New York 's Governor Nelson Rockefeller sent a bill to the legislature that would permit the state 's Air Pollution Control Board to establish even stricter fuel standards . <P> Even with the new laws , it will obviously be several years before New Yorkers can begin to breathe easily again . " What we 're doing is racing to stand still , " says Caroline Konheim of the Citizens for Clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsored the new city bill , " once we get New York cleaned up , we 'll just begin to realize how bad New Jersey smells .
