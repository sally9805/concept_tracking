FROM THE HAND OF THE HUNTER ( 277 pp. ) - John Braine - Houghfon M/'f-flin ( $3.75 ) . <P> In Room at the Top ( TIME , May 27 , 1957 ) , British Novelist John Braine dealt with the reek of ill-gained success as experienced by a bounder inwardly appalled by his own amorality . In his second novel , Braine deals with the opposite , savors the sour scent of failure as lived by a welfare-state weakling . When the book opens , Dick Corvey , the novel 's nonhero , is in a tuberculosis hospital . Behind him lie an army stretch marked by cowardice and a childhood marred by rich but weird imagination . He had peopled a sinister world in which the evil Vodi , led by a heartless witch , controlled human destinies ; as an adult , he seems under her spell still . <P> He has never had a decent job , has always instinctively looked for the softest touch-and in his heart he knows that his own weakness has always been the enemy . His girl has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalking her . But he still has his looks , his tenuous charm . For a time it seems that his love for a nurse will pull him out of his resentment and self-pity ; but she recognizes that any wife of Dick 's is bound to become a mere crutch . At the end , the author unconvincingly suggests that Dick may yet try for the better prizes of life . <P> This grey , depressing tale is saved by Author Braine 's sure knowledge of his characters . He is unpitying as he sketches their fretful struggles to swim free of the muddy currents of ordinariness that surround ordinary Englishmen . Their speech rings as true as the clink of cheap teacups , their attempts at gaiety have all the poor authority of weak beer .
