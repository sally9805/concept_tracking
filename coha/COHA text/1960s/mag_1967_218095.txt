The rules of the road for cars , boats and planes were once informal and relaxed . But increased use of the vehicles eventually made it necessary to amend and incorporate them into formal sets of statutes . The same thing seems in store for skiing . So many people are now getting around on skis that they are running into each other as well as less animate objects at alarming rates . The first thing they want to know as soon as they are in traction is whom to sue , and how . <P> So far the answer has had to be based on precedent . Ever since Wright v. Mt . Mansfield Lift , Inc. in Vermont 16 years ago , it has been held that the skier assumes certain obvious risks when he starts down a slope . If he is unfortunate enough to run smack into a stump or a buried fence , it is usually considered not to be the fault of the stump or the stump 's owners . Conversely , when a skier is heading uphill on a lift , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of mechanical collapse or breakdown unless the injured party was guilty of contributory negligence such as , say , bouncing around in the seat or leaning out to ogle a passing ski bunny . There is little precedent , however , when it comes to skiers knocking into each other . <P> No Rules . There have been few such cases . Easter v. Segelbaum , decided in Washington state , is typical . Easter , who had been standing in a tow line , successfully recovered damages from Segelbaum , who had come whizzing off the end of the trail , slicing one of Easter 's left leg tendons . But most collisions result in no suit , in part because no rule clearly spells out who is to blame . In Europe , where skiing ranks right behind traffic and industry as the leading everyday accident hazard , the problem is more serious . <P> Three weeks ago , a pretty German became the first known hit-and-run skier to be arrested . Skiing down an Austrian Alp , she had crashed into another girl , jabbing a ski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schuss merrily on down without so much as a word . But because no law covers the situation precisely , it is uncertain just what will happen to the offender . <P> A meeting of European skier-lawyers last year attempted to make a start at dealing with the situation , and similar meetings are planned this April . Many are opposed to a binding code . " It would ruin the sport , " moans Paul Maschke , a lawyer , and president of the Radstadt Ski Club . " They would soon be issuing skiing licenses the same as drivers ' licenses . " But if the growing popularity of skiing continues to increase the population on any incline with snow , the view of another Austrian lawyer , Dr. Karl Homann , is likely to pack more weight . " Rules are not enough , " he says . " You need laws to stop careless skiing . The sport may have risks , but having to bear the carelessness of another is unfair . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
