There is no one more serious than a character in a farce . The mirth belongs solely to the audience ; if a performer cracks a smile , he crumbles the whole absurd structure . No one knows the rules better than Philippe de Broca ( The Love Game , That Man from Rio ) . In The <P> Devil by the Tail , as in his previous films , the French director bends the truth but never quite breaks it , and makes sure that even during its wildest moments his comedy keeps a straight face . <P> In a ruined chateau , a family of French aristocrats are slowly starving to death . The austere , haughty marquise conceives a plan . With the help of God-and her daughter and granddaughter-she will turn the place into a bordello . As Baudelaire wrote and the picture illustrates , " Life is a hospital in which every patient is possessed with the desire to change his bed . " In a sudden deluge of customers , the most libidinous patient is Cesar ( Yves Montand ) , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house conspire to render unto themselves what is Cesar's-a million stolen francs-with a genteel little murder . But under the international law that protects farceurs , Cesar not only escapes with his life but also with the affection of the chateau 's only virgin , Jeanne ( Clotilde Joano ) . <P> For years , Montand has been living two lives . Onstage he is a singer of romantic ballads and risque street songs . Onscreen , in such films as La Guerre Est Finie and Live for Life , he is as grim and bitter as Humphrey Bogart . In The Devil by the Tail , he takes his stage personality out of the trunk and refurbishes it with a series of warm interludes and witty tongue-in-cheek pantomimes . As the marquise 's daughter , Maria Schell also alters her usually grim image with a comically erotic performance and an exuberantly uplifted bosom . <P> The word farce comes from a Latin verb meaning " to stuff . " Too often film farces are crammed with top-of-the-lungs comedians and bottom-of-the-gag-file comedy . The Devil by the Tail fills its hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the stuff of life-and of laughter .
