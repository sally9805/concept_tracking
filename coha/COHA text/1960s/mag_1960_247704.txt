Volcano on the Summit <P> Sir : <P> Let all Americans stand 100% behind our President , and let us be ready for the next summit conference without fear , but with peace in our hearts . <P> <P> ROBERT STANTON <P> San Francisco <P> SIR : <P> PRESIDENT EISENHOWER DID NOT MUFF A THING . HIS GREATEST TRIUMPH AT THE SUMMIT WAS THAT HE TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT THE SPY PLANE . BECAUSE HE DID , EVERY WORD HE SAYS CAN BE BELIEVED BY US , BY OUR ALLIES AND BY THE WHOLE FREE WORLD . <P> <P> ARCHIBALD I. MCCOLL KALAMAZOO , MICH . <P> <P> Sir : <P> A proud moment of belonging to truth , a feeling of recapturing some lost courage . <P> <P> JAMES M. O'CONNOR <P> South Pasadena , Calif . <P> <P> Sir : <P> It must have taken all degrees of decere-bration to have produced the froth that leveled the summit . I weep for the people of Russia , who must trust to such leadership - and for us who must find leaders who can contend with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you we shoulda ' let ' em see Disneyland ! <P> <P> NORMAN B. KELLOW <P> Alloway , N.J. should condone the flight of an espionage plane over the Soviet Union TIME , May 161 . This is clearly in violation of international law and is justified by the Administration solely in terms of expediency . <P> As a former Army officer , I appreciate the value of good military intelligence , but I do not believe that the end justifies the means ; this has been a slogan of the Communists with which we have heretofore heartily disagreed . <P> <P> MITCHELL DREESE North Arlington , Va . <P> <P> Sir : <P> <P> Why all the threats and simulated indignation on the part of Moscow because an American flyer was " shot down " over Russian territory ? Russia has been carrying on an organized spy system in this country for a decade or more . Can it be that N. K. can give it out but ca n't take it ? Or is the real basis for the uproar the discovery that they have been being spied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> <P> PAUL E. BLANCHARD <P> Grants Pass , Ore . <P> <P> Sir : <P> <P> I am sorry that we sent planes into Russia . I am ashamed that we lied and were caught lying about it . I am enraged that some of our leaders , probably in ignorance , beat vengeful war drums before the truth came out . But , most of all , I am proud that we had the guts and the greatness to let the truth out . <P> <P> ARNOLD M. SWEIG <P> Plainville , Conn . <P> <P> Sir : <P> The Central Intelligence Agency should be renamed Civilian Idiotic Antagonisms . <P> <P> JACK C. BRACE Plainfield , N.J. <P> <P> Sir : <P> If the dear hearts and gentle people would think back to Pearl Harbor , they might recall that the surprise blow was struck midst tea-and talks aimed at achieving a common ground of understanding . Such men as Powers and the agency they represent deserve our overwhelming gratitude for undertaking the perilous task of reducing the element of ' " surprise . " The idiots in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would close their minds to the possible parallel of tea and vodka . <P> <P> DOROTHY D. DREIMAN <P> Fairborn , Ohio
