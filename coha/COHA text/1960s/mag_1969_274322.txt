FAT CITY by Leonard Gardner . 183 pages . Farrar , Straus &; Giroux. $5.50 . <P> Characters in boxing fiction rarely graduate beyond caricature . The manager is an insensitive swine ; for a month 's supply of subway tokens he would send a fighter up against a mountain slide . The fighter , swimming up from economic backwaters , is a supreme dolt and an exploited object of surface pity . Then comes the trainer , faithful as a mutt . Behind them all sits the omnipotent syndicate , whose generals eat pheasant under glass and meticulously avoid the sauce stains . <P> Such figures , no doubt once true enough , are now quite dated . Today 's manager is a beaverish scuffler who stays in boxing only because it is the life he knows . The fighter often tells the manager what to do . He may still be chased into the ring by the pinch of poverty and some inner reach toward identity , but he usually does not accept pain and futility for long . If he does stay in and does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving and perceptive first novel , he will find the modern fight scene , though anything but richly dramatic , every bit as cruel and lonely as ever . <P> Unlike the army of Hemingway romanticists who cultivate fighters to show off their feel for the sport , Gardner has a real understanding of the ring and the nameless people who are scarred by it . With a poetic touch and dry swift phrasing , he has created a remarkable portrait of a marginal , subterranean world in which two fighters and a manager occupy numbing neutral corners in the struggle for life . <P> The place is Stockton , Calif. , a city filled with a litter of lost people , most of whom pile on urine-smelling buses each morning and head for the onion , peach or walnut fields for a killing day on skinny wages . Gardner 's three characters are grafted to this landscape . An aging ( 29 ) lightweight , lush and former local contender , Billy Tully grieves over his split with his wife , who occupies his flophouse dreams and gives him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding himself in a Y.M.C.A. gym , he meets Ernie Munger , an 18-year-old would-be welterweight and sends him to his own long-suffering ex-manager , Ruben Luna . This should be some sort of beginning . But the three are going precisely no place . Tully dries out for one more fight . He wins-but finds his victory meaningless . He wanders the streets realizing that he is a bum . The deprivation of his life is somehow symbolized by the memory of sleeping in a park with other derelicts while city workmen cut down the trees that have provided them with protective shade . <P> Marks of Hell . Gardner 's fight talk is brilliantly accurate . The true pathos of fighting as a subsistence trade , he shows , comes not from scheming and exploitation but from the slow corruption of courage and spirit . " Fat City , " as fighters sometimes call success in boxing , is bankrupt . The long sleek cars , the sweet shock of public recognition , the feel of silk on skin is , for most fighters , pure celluloid fantasy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sameness that is itself the mark of most hells.
