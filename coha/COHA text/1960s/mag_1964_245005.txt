Into a ragged rubber plantation 30 miles northwest of Saigon swarmed 115 helicopters . The craft disgorged 1,100 taut , trigger-happy South Vietnamese troops while another 6,000 men charged in aboard armored personnel carriers to block potential escape routes . Rockets laced the 40-sq. - mi. area , smashing huts and sending greasy black smoke pluming skyward , while a 19-boat force stirred up the Saigon River in watchful patrol . This was " Operation Brushfire " - the long-awaited , widely discussed push against the Viet Cong of Binh Duong province , the men who had probably mortared <P> Biehhoa airbase and destroyed 13 U.S. bombers ( TiME , Nov. 13 ) . <P> It should have been called " Backfire . " <P> By the time the troops arrived , the main Viet Cong force had long since departed . Villagers who survived the harsh pre-assault bombardment by government forces shakily reported that the Communists had pulled out three days earlier . A few , at least , stuck around , as the South Vietnamese learned to their dismay later in the week . Recombing a maze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves under accurate but sporadic machine-gun fire . Ten Vietnamese soldiers died , and a helicopter carrying wounded away was knocked down , killing eleven more . History 's hugest helicopter operation netted only two confirmed Communist guerrillas , three rifles , 15 grenades and a battered motor bike . <P> <P> By contrast , a spur-of-the-moment raid in Quang Nam province caught the Communists with their black pajamas down . The 17-chopper " Eagle " force dropped 54 Rangers on a company of surprised Viet Cong ; the toll was 17 Red dead , 21 captured . To the precariously balanced Saigon regime of Premier Tran Van Huong , still hanging on despite another week of student demonstrations , the lesson was painfully clear : any operation plan more than eight hours in the making is bound to be found out by the Viet Cong . Just as the French learned during their long , losing Indo-China campaign , the South Vietnamese and their U.S. advisers were discovering that you ca n't swat a fly with a **25;1185;TOOLONG if it takes too long to lift the hammer .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
