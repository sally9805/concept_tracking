As the 87th Congress began its sessions last week , liberal Democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the House Rules Committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor . The liberal pressure bloc ( which coyly masquerades under the name Democratic Study Group ) had fought the committee before , and had always lost . This time , they were much better prepared and organized , and the political climate was favorable . They had the unspoken support of President-elect Kennedy , whose own legislative program was menaced by the Rules Committee bottleneck . And counting noses , they seemed to have the votes to work their will . <P> Deadly Deadlock . There were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the Rules Committee : 1 ) to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock , or 2 ) to remove one of the conservatives-namely Mississippi 's 14-term William Meyers Colmer ( pronounced Calmer ) . Caucusing , the liberals decided to go after Colmer , which actually was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to godliness . <P> A dour , gangling man with a choppy gait , Colmer looks younger than his 70 years , has gradually swung from a moderate , internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative . He is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project , unless it happens to benefit his Gulf Coast constituents . He is , of course , a segregationist , but he says he has never made an " anti-Negro " speech . For 20 years he has enjoyed his power on the Rules Committee . There his vote , along with those of Chairman Howard Smith , the courtly Virginia judge , and the four Republican members , could and often did produce a 6-6 deadlock that blocked far-out Democratic-sponsored welfare legislation ( a tactic often acceptable to the Rayburn-Johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes ) . <P> Equal Treatment . There was sufficient pretext to demand Colmer 's ouster : he had given his lukewarm support to the anti-Kennedy electors in Mississippi . Reprisals are not unheard of in such situations , but the recent tendency has been for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against Harry Truman , and in 1957 , after Congressman Adam Clayton Powell campaigned for Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 , his fellow Democrats did not touch his committee assignments , although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage . ( In the heat of the anti-Colmer drive last week , Judge Smith threatened reprisal against Powell . Said he : " We will see whether whites and Negroes are treated the same around here . " ) But Speaker Sam Rayburn , after huddling in Palm Beach with President-elect Kennedy , decided that this year something had to be done about the Rules Committee - and that he was the only man who could do anything effective . <P> In a tense , closed-door session with Judge Smith , Rayburn attempted to work out a compromise : to add three new members to the Rules Committee ( two Democrats , including one Southerner , and one Republican ) . Smith flatly rejected the offer , and Mister Sam thereupon decided to join the rebels . The next morning he summoned a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news : he would lead the fight to oust Colmer , whom he is said to regard as " an inferior man . "
