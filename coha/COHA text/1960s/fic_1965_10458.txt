And Our legend is that we are not of One neutral indivisibility . Mark you , this has nothing to do with individuals as governed  --  we are n't political . Our myth , our angelic myth that consolesus when we too , even in all our lovely Oblong , shrink a little , a little droop , from normal convexity , is that a One of us , therefore all Ones , have within them a heavenly bit of gender , of which , under the Oligarchy of One , we are not supposed to know .

No wonder they were the pioneers here . Their thinking is curved to begin with . And further , on a rectilinear planet , or at least one organizedto be so , was n't Her thinking a bit  --  ? I could n't find a compound word to fit it , either in any of the languages I carried instant knowledge of as a One , or in either of the two I had slowed down enough to share with Her .

" No , Marie 's development ' as been very rapide of late , in fact better than me . No-o  --  not Marie . " And then she made the cluck-tick which characteristicallyended the lesson . " Wait ! " I said . " Not so fa -1 Pas si vite ! " " Oh , la , la ! " she said . " ' Ow quick you learn to slow down , eh . You ' ave been a remarkable pupil . " " Oh , I du n no , " I said .

" And  --  we 'll always be friends , eh ? " Can an intercom smile ? From the depths of the depths  --  or perhaps around the corner  --  it answered me . " Au revoir ! "  |p103WHEN  she had gone , I was left behind . It was the first thing that struck me . And that it was not a mere matter of subtraction . These are the observations which must be immediately recorded by the traveler into an affective world , before his own flesh takes on the qualitative tinge of his surroundings . We , who are still incompletely numerical , shall be unable wholly to tell you the What of Us , just as You , frozen median between words and numbers , will never quite be able to give us all your Why . Between beings each so mixed as You and We , this is bound to happen . But primers are beautiful , even though they must always imperfectly soar . They are like the poetry which occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , as the arc strains to remember the time when it was perpendicular . In Ellipsia , when some of us leave , there are always some left behind , so it is less noticeable ; we are people of concertedaction , in an action-at-a-distance world . But this time , on being left , I found myself immediately extended in I-ness . I was immediately and suddenly provided with images of myself which were both outside me and beside me , hopping along in a sort of trio with " I , " and always referring back to it . I was of course experiencing my first concentrated dose of your Right Hereness.  |p104Conceive  of it , the first time a being of such instantaneity as mine does this , as if a butterfly whose waverings are measured in light-years might arrest itself on the wee presto of one minute , and affix itself there . Less strange to you perhaps , who are trained to bear it from birth , but for me this sudden attack of " one-ness "  --  and before I had heard there might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extreme . This is how it was . Before it becomes forgettable  --  this is how it is . I saw myself , a great , amorphous being , veiled within its own veils , lying in its glass cage . I could see the trees , and myself looking at them . This stage lasted for some time , peculiar , but only a tickle of suffering . Strangely enough , the cage was a help to me , dictating to me such boundaries as I must begin to have here . Finally , a squirrel approached the glass , one rounded corner of it , where the walls joined . From outside , he was at the lower left-hand corner , from within , at the lower right-hand . He stood there , like a signature  --  it was thus I learned those simple locations , to me so profound . After a while , he was joined by other small animals , not all of his kind , but some , so bringing it about that I did not make note of when he himself was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Genera that were separate from me of course , who was still lying there . And this  --  was almost pleasant . As they continued to course before the glass , coming and going , I understood that this had been happening all the while , and that this rhythm was in its way also a helpful enclosure . Until now , I had not been seeing them , that was all . And then it happened . I sensed all their paired eyes at the glass , an army of them , seeing me : and looking out , seeing them  --  Mine . They were here in all their eyes to bring home to me how and what was human . The rending came then , such a flesh-clap to a plasm untrained to it . Here I am.  |p105All  considering , I came out of it pretty well , and quickly too , especially since the room was so lacking in any array of objects  --  your classic method by which to forget yourselves . I suppose curved objects would have been of less use to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to subjectme too bruisably to the square . Or perhaps it was by design that I was left thus alone , to complicate . For , exactly as with you , it was my confusions which went into action at once , to get me down off that dread apex of solitude . The trouble with me is that I had so many of them . And unlike you , all so primal . The sense of variability , when it invades a One , is like a rape . Or so I conceive it . It makes one sick of philosophy , for one thing . For another , an exchange of shames takes place . Or rather , your shame becomes our pleasure . As , I assume , happens in reverse , when Unanimity attacks visitors to us . In any case , things with me became more concretized  --  though nothing to what they would be in the second dialogue . Once I had calmed down , the glass once again nothing but a prospect of a view , its avenue however extended now toward a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found myself able to do , be , and think a number of things at once , in a manner which was indescribably  --  well , you know . I was able to move about , daintily slow , just as you do , and in spite of having no feet , more or less as you do , and also in much the same balance , if you like , that you maintain with your surroundings  --  which you are able to maintaindespite the fact that in a closed laboratory such as this room must have been , there would be no known experiment which could determine whether the force that is pressing the observer 's feet to the floor is gravity , or an upward accelerationof the laboratory . Ah you dears , imagine that ! To add to my pleasure , suddenly become aware of the shadows cached even in unmirrored glass , I was able , by ap106kind of grossly wide peekaboo-ing , to conceive of myself as of a certain height and axis , these later determined as of approximately seventy-eight inches end-to-end , circumference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not lack characteristic of a sort , we are an uncolorful , unselfconsciouspeople . Looking upon myself now , I described a pinkness up to now seen only on the brink of imagination . I turned once or twice before the glass , seeing poised on its end , at an angle of not quite ninety degrees from the floor , a long , roseate form , full of senses which were by infinitesimals beginning to separate themselves , its surface smooth and continuousas the skin of a stone of perfected shape  --  clean , unmarredand closed , not an arc out of curve , and no orifice anywhere . It did not occur to me to quarrel with this . Altogether , my person seemed to me a not undistinguished one to represent its place of Origin . The next complication then asserted itself I began to brood over the conversation just past . When , across all the coaxials of unimaginability , your pulsings began to be received by us ( and who shall say which one of us is the future of whose past ? ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not much honor ; we had long been angling for recognitionfrom a quarter rather more advanced . For , as some of Ours had long since calculated  --  if there was a uniform expansion of the universe , and if the motion of expansion were reversed into contraction , like a moving picture run backward , why then , the entire known universe would converge to a single point , indicating the hour of its birth . Ours have long since found themselves capable of peering past this theoreticalbirth of the universe , into the beyond . Yours , as you no doubt know , have long proclaimed that Nature forbids you ever to peer as far even as that . Indeed , Ours and Yours in that field lamentably resemble one another in blaming the limits of their own nature on Nature ; We even have a schoolp107which miserably contends we shall never see beyond the beyond , to the Beyond . But consider  --  in order that our attitude may be forgivable . Although it had taken you , according to my studies since arriving , from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send signals at all , and these suggestively childlike  --  it was borne upon us almost at once that you thought yourselves unique . A form of life that deems itself not merely the Highest but located on the Only deserves a rebuff or two  --  and there We were but half as culpable as You . Knowing in fact , according to such apperceptibilities as we were in command of , how crowded things already were  --  we forgot all about you . Even the total amount of radio noise emitted by your planet is so weak , so cosmi-comically unimportant , it is no wonder that when your persistent nagging was once again reported to the Orifice , the tenor of Opinion should be , in Our idiom : " Silence in the Quorum house ; the monkey wants to Quote . " But then . . . ah , then ! Just as I was dwelling on that next eventuality , I caught a furtive movement outside the glass , in the far distance ( sic ! ) near the pergola , a movement of figures which my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never by reason of my shape to disappear entirely , could not quite make out . Then they vanished , a reminder that I too must soon make my debut outside . My thoughts returned to that next episode in our mutual history , romantic episode it must surely be called according to my education in your libraries , though this may have been rather too specifically confined to say for sure . But fancy on it ! Suddenly , out of the blue ( you are sendingprimers by now ) our lackadaisical receptors are aware that a new set of beings has taken over your sending stations . We of course think of these beings as a set , not being disposedp108to conceive of individual Ones , much less of differences in temperament among them . In contrast with the old set , this new set appeared to be  --  oh these compound words !  --  let us say brightly-stupid , where the former set had been stupidlybright . The new climate of transmittance had therefore an aura of humility about it , which inclined at least One listener to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incestuantstream of his follow beings . And now comes the romance , or is it legend , or is it folklore ? For is it not axiomic with you , in one or the other of these areas , that in time of Newtonal need , an ' era ( as She pronounced it ) shall always appear ? And ' e will be One , more than likely , from the first bubble of birth somewhat apart from the Others . Though , strangely enough , ' e will be in the end more touchable than any of them . And finally  --  ' e will more than likely be a runt . This helps to develop temperament . On a genderless planet , said the primer , to develop a bit of temperament would be enough . And that was the story . For , across all the bent light-rays of contingency , One of us was able to do that . I could n't help another peek in the glass , at my new limits . As yet , I had no idea as to what size a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To say nothing of that other definition of me which I wanted so badly to  --  prove . But I knew one thing . ' E ' ad done it . And ' e or she , ' e was Me . So , via that lonely-lovely band of enthusiasts , my arrival here had been effected , with all arrangements neatly made . Because of the disparity between Our state of advancement and yours , details of the trip were most easily taken care of from Our end . The accommodation devised here , however , has been utterly ingenious  --  that is indeed your talent . From Here on in , the path to the climacteric of our adventure seemed immortally clear , even a path which , across thep109billarions between , might become well worn . And up to now  --  up to the moment when I turned modestly away from further self-ing , and toward the curved book-wall which held the great folios of electro-braille , and the blown-up photostats of all the dragons that have stalked their little globe  --  up to now , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is not a great stalker , but an army of squirrels . Almost fainting or sinking  --  what a feeling it is when the I wobbles like that !  --  I steadied myself against those helpful shelves , repeating the conclusion of the catechism : " Resolved : That for those who wish to emigrate from either side , there shall be set up a means for an Exchange of Persons . " Yes , that was our great adventure . And having concluded , I started over again : " Whereas  --  " and went through it completely . For purposes of holding oneselfwhere one is , there is nothing more tonic than a catechism firmly repeated . For , with each circle of it , I found I could toss a doubt overboard : It is not the means for the project that bothers me , nor the risks to those at home , who must be prepared to undergo what I had , nor that I may lack recruits , even though I can not as yet assure any One what gender would be theirs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am still Here . If anything , it was Her confusion , at the end of our talk , which was most worrying me now . Not mine . Why , I was even clearheaded enough now to be able to find that compoundword  --  to describe her state of mind  --  which had earlier eluded me . Since , at home , what we use for language begins with monosyllable , and thereafter concentricates inward , while Your Babel proliferates every which way , it is no easy task for a One to choose words here , much less combinethem . Yet I did it ! I found the exact word to describe her temperament : silly-unsafe . Curiously enough , she had n't seemed so in the beginning . Silly-unsafe . And why this shouldp110provoke in me , even as I said it again , that same tender feeling  --  was still a mystery to me . Suddenly it was clear to me , what was happening . The process was taking over . Even as her intellect swelled gently into curve , mine of course  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean I was giving evidence of gender , or acquiring it ? One thing at least I now suspected . It was unsafe to assume that they would let me choose . Idly now , and much less nervously , I rested in my niche , carefully avoiding either end of the wall where , though still rounded , there was a kind of corner , no doubt placed there to get me used to the idea . Quick as I am , it seemed to me impossible that I should learn anything more this morning . But in addition to the discovery that I have just recounted , and to my having found that it takes approximatelythirty-five rounds of the catechism for my temperamentto settle itself , surely a useful prescription to have  --  another residue remained . Revolving slowly at my usual angle of inclination  --  somewhat less acute than the angle at which the gyroscope forever aims at the same point in the heavens  --  I contemplated this fact , as newly embodied in Me . An army of doubts can be terrifying , perhaps even return one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently one generalizedlittle itching of it is just the friction to hold us down to the variable . I could n't get over how self-contained a certainmeasure of doubt had helped me to feel . I could n't get over looking . For what did I see but that I was now  --  though still rather too delicately for plebeian purposes  --  rather more visible than before . And what should happen then , but that , no sooner than emerged from the pinkness of that joy , I should be assaulted by , provided with  --  oh , sneaky-sneaky , your diversions are endless !  --  another . I saw on the shelf , just parallel with my top curve , or perhaps an inch or two below it , a small openp111book I had n't noticed before . And looking into it  --  how .. . can . . . I ... say . . . this ... slowly enough ? I had become slowed down enough to  --  In fact , as I now know , except for a nucleole here and there or possibly a particle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could read . Not without design , the book was one containing many soliloquies . Though as yet I could only read instantly , the whole book being plain to me at one gulp-glance , I found that by repeating this process , I could manage to linger here and there , to savor . I rank this , among all the experiences I have had here , as perhaps the  --  well , I suppose I should reserve judgment . But  --  a fact you may be ignorant of  --  since at home Our life , or Life , is in its serene totality considered a work of what you would call art , we have none of your lesser muses . So , you may understand what I was up against as I first read  --  such contortions and coagulations , such strenuosities as who would conceive language or anything else here would curve toward ?  --  I was adaze . And au contraire to all my practical training here so far , the business of which had been to separate the data of those senses which in me already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the see-er , that one tastes with the tongue only  --  this book of verse seemed almost suicidally intent on going back to the melange . And from this plunge , what a rainbow of the variable , as if the lenses of many telescopes large and small had been melted down in a pot where all the other sensations besides vision were already waiting  --  what flapping banners of color , what marble pictures , eaten by music ! Good God !  --  I was glad I had been given that phrase , by whatever duenna . And beneath all of this , a contra-dieting , of such an imperativeas I had never met before , as if all the muscles of mind were at work against shape of any kind , against it and number and quality also , dragging up , ever up , out of the potpourri , in a neap tide toward its own pure moon . Good God.  |p112What  saved me from going back , for good , where I came from ? Yes , I confess it , there was a moment there when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I hung between our two worlds like a jack-in-the-box in the pit of the gondola of a balloon going around infinity . I ask you , very humbly . What saves you ? All I now remember is that , dizzying myself against the shelves , at what must have been an acute caricature of my customary angle , I asked Me , to be sure in the manner of the soliloquy , yet with something of Myself added : Can I bear it ? Can these veils support  --  the insupportable ? Can this integument  --  withstand it ? Can a One who was clearly not intended to  --  be a " one " ? Can I bear all this here-splitting ? And cautiously-furtively , from somewhere withonward , I was answered . Not vocally , not even with any of the facilities of language  --  whose little games and pastimes I began from that moment to despise . It was . . . as if many images fluttered toward me to console me as I myself would wish to be consoled , to prove me the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition : Yes , you can if you stand up straight . Once you learn the quantity of your own strength . If you 'll just stand up straight , and be a  --  Where these intimations might be engendered , I had no idea , as , firmly now , they goose-stepped toward me impeccablyfrom all directions , until finally , by the most brilliant of maneuvers  --  hup , one , two , hup  --  they co-imaged in me , , henceforth their center . Halt ! And slowly , slowly , I felt myself  --  from without but from within too  --  pressured up toward the perpendicular . One by one , each image came forward , gave me an invigorating punch , and retired smartly , fist still ready-clenched . You are straight . You are strong . You are hard . You are hardstrong . You are straight . Each of these blows was accompanied by a distant background music as of yo-heave-ho 's and encouragements . " Steady me boyo and upp113you go ! " In a final rain of blows , I was hoisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are never . You are never , punch . Silly . You are never silly , punch . Punch , punch , punch . Never . You are never silly-weak , punch . Never silly-soft , punch . You are never , punch , in any way curved . And suddenly  --  " wuddya know , boys "  --  there I was , perched on top of Myself , a good bit higher than any of the gargoyles I had seen looking out over Paris . After the first surfeit  --  miles and miles of it and what a view  --  the world was mine if I could only stay up there  --  a few doubts came by , but nothing to worry about , a few ravens . You would n't have thought them enough to make me almost afraid to look down at myself , to wake up . At last , I was emboldened to dare to look at myself once again in the glass  --  and wuddya know , indeed . I was a dream . To be sure , I was n't any more visible than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no bumps , no holes . But there was n't a sign of the horizontal or the acute about me . I was a perfect dream of the vertical . This is it , I thought ; this is really it . This is How I Am . And a last punch hit me . You are safe.  |p114WHEN  a " one " of the beings here first begins to suspect that he is acquiring a character , or as you like to say , firming one , the first thing he asks himself to do is to test it , in order to find out what it is . And in my progress toward becoming one of you , I was no exception . Since , at home , character is unmixed with gender , I was perhaps under even direr need to do so , being totally unable to distinguish between them . Perhaps both were acquired at one strike here , which would certainly be by far the most economical , I found myself thinking , then scalded myself for hanging on to an idea which was far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which they would handle things in this marvelously spendrift world . They would certainly be more haphazard about something so important here . And there must be some prescribed one of their hazards which would be the proper test for what I now had . How I was to find out by myself what this test was for a few paltry minutes perplexed me , until it occurred to me that I need only put my trust in what I now had , and perhaps it would already be influential enough to instruct me how to test it . It was time for a little self-exhortation . " I am straight  --  " I said to myself , " very straight . " And I am strong ,  |p115|perha|ps  not very , but . . . quite ? I feel certain that I am about to be  --  whatever it is that I am about to be . After a few round-rubbings of this , I looked down at myself and found I had indeed worked up a glow . Why , I had no idea , I thought self-admiringly , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time . And though by now somewhat winded , and though it was well past the hour for my midday inflation , without pausing to so refresh myself , I went on , conjuring my image . " I am  --  whatever it is that carries its own weight , stands fast , and talks short . I intend to fight for my rites . I am a being of few words . Or as soon as I get over my initiation , I intend to be . I intend to act . And there is n't a curve in my body ! " This last was n't true , of course ; indeed , quite a large part of my statement was couched in words which were unfamiliar to me , but certainly must have swum up out of my own innerstink . But , if I were ever really to get over being an ellipse  --  that carefulest of beings bogged in the middlemean  --  this was all part of it . " This is all part of it ! " I almost shouted . Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had spoken only by means of an all-over surface vibration , but now this appeared to have localized itself somewhereabove my diameter , narrowing its timbre but widening its volume . That I not only had a voice , but that its first real utterance was almost a shout , was not this enormously encouraging to what I had in mind ? And just then  --  I fell back , exhausted . Indeed , miserable to report , I fell back so thoroughly that I found myself far beyond my former angle , far gone past even an acute case of it  --  in fact , I was pure horizontal . Now , ellipses , like the horses I had seen in some of the photostats , never lie down in this position ; unlike you , they are never even caught dead in it . Pride goeth , I thought ,  |p116lying  there . How it would have alleviated my misery to know all the positions you are really capable of  --  that this was all part of it too . But at the time , all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my image . " It 's because I do n't know my own strength as yet , " I said . Do n't say as yet , came the caution . I spoke up , still with a sigh . " Rather , I am simply a being who does n't know its own strength . " When there was no reply , I took that to mean that I might continue in this vein . " Probably , I am a creature of such strength that it would be dangerous for me not to know the limits of it . " Silence . " Maybe I ought to test my strength-hood , not for itself , but for the sake of the weaklings I will surely encounter . " Quite a pause after this one , too . So at last I dared to say it . " Try me . What is the test for what I believe to be my  --  " But since I was n't really sure whether it was character or gender I was applying for , I simply shouted again , this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And found myself miraculously on my feet  --  that is , vertical  --  once more . And not only that  --  even braver . I went round the room , and anywhere I met myself in the glass , which was everywhere , I said to it , " Come on now , think you know the test , huh ; come on now , brother ! " Brother . Where does one get those ideas ? But when the answer came it was right from my authority in the glass there . It was only a whisper , quietlyfirmly , as such answers should come , but I heard it . " Want to step outside ? I dare you . Why do n't you step outside , andjust see ? And since my intended being was not one to refuse a dare , that was what I prepared to do . Greenhorn that I was , I even gathered up almost all my energy , under the impression that what had carried me afield and over the great transparencies would more than easy fade me through a wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , regally obvious one of about ten feet in height , but of course , as far as doors were concernedp117and staircases , too , or any of those playthings which cater to the appendages , I was an aristocrat and had never used one in my life , the same being true of my manner of dealing with obstacles , it never having occurred to me to go over or around one , instead of through . So I gathered myself for the elide , took a last look at my image  --  never pinker , never prouder  --  said jauntily , " I 'll meet you outside ! " , touched the proper thought , and  --  WHAM . How I lived to tell this tale must after all be some sort of durility test  --  I must have ricocheted from surface to surface , up , down and sideways , fully thirteen times , being saved only by the dimensions of the room , just big enough to permit me the barest air-interval of relief , between making connections . During which , as with your drowners here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had gone against everything my mentors had been at such pains to teach me  --  against all the friction , weightfulness and lethargy it had taken me months to acquire . Above all  --  and as if I had never heard of catechisms  --  I had totally forgotten how much more Here I now was than There . Only let me get through this , I prayed , I promised , and I 'll never again forget the distance between a floor and a ceiling . And it 's true , I 've never had to stop to puzzle over that later ; there 's something to be said for the school of hard knocks . Then at last , I once again lay prone . And so bruised was I in my humilities , that I made no effort to get up . Instead , I did what any One wounded in his veils does . I lay there dreaming , in repair . And how to reveal to you , the all too solid stuffs of these laydreams , how to confess the obscene shapes of those private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  I could not hope to open these to you , had I not recently begun to put aside our shames in exchange for yours . Even so , if there were any way to get around it , or even through  --  but no . You must have revealed to you what really lies at the darkp118root of all Our wontedly pure ovality . Know therefore , that we are not allowed to . . . that it is a sin to conceive of it .. . that  --  we do not know what we are like inside . That it is aportal sin even to enter there in the slightest , imaginatively . And that round the clock , we never stop doing it . There . It follows that your and our spiritual paths do indeed resemble , diverging only in their blames . Things being open to dissection here , you are given to flogging yourselves for not being more ethereal , while our phantasmagoria aspire ever toward the solid , and in such seductively illegal shapes as are an everyday business with you . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiously mutual . Oddly enough , you suffer modesty over certain of your appendages and orifices , of which everybody knows perfectly well . We save our blushes for our imaginary organs , the mere knowledge of the possession of which would be our miracle . Not that we do n't have our mystic seekers after the unknowable  --  which , considering the difficulties of investigating creatures so incorporeal and instantaneous , it almost certainly is  --  at least on home ground . Nevertheless , this does n't preventthe paths around the crater from being crammed night and day with obscurantists staring into the opposing lava streams which respectively shape our fresh citizens and replace our stale ones , crowded there supposedly in honor of such a perfect scheme of things , but everyone knows what they 're looking for ; it 's a civic scandal . Sooner , alas , can You find your inner souls by looking for them , than we our inner shapes . So , however , you and Ours have continued to do for millenia , when all the time they had better have looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to the good of course , but we have our more pedestrian systems of amusement , a sub rosa traffic of risks and frolic where we disport ourselves with the shadier side of ourselves  --  and very in/ventively so , considering the flimsy we have to work with . Indeed it is here that our most exquisite caste distinctions are formed . For , not having any ideas of number in accumulationsuch as you , all those superiorities which you can attach to piles of gold or aggregations of power , we can ascribe only to lineage , just as you can of course in addition , but in a most contrary focus . For where you can look gloriously back to what you and Yours have been , we base all our bloodlines on our fleshly future . And because ours are in the realms of the unknown , the categories are all the more absolute . Down at the bottom are those whose peep-show , postcard lusts are of the lazier , most unenlightened sort , running mostly to generalized visions of the interiors of Ones , jokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , et cetera used by our ancestors before we became Ones of all the same ancestry . This class of Ones is given to gibes on the absence of body openings  --  which japes run almost parallel to yours on the presence of them . Next above is that largest cult whose rather more perfervidvisions cluster around one or other of your main organs , and here too in a certain hierarchy , those addicted to lung fantasy being rather more elegant than those of the liver , but neither having the social advantages of those whose frenzies and perturbations liberate themselves around the idea of a heart . Esoteric cults , or some minor organ , or exotic or newly discovered conception of one , engage some ; hangouts for these , being frowned upon as bohemia , are everywhere . There are even those introverts who adhere to the legal image and honestly worship what all of us are under guard to say we do  --  the empty future of Us as we Are . And of course a few neuters whose imaginative heat runs so low that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as must be admitted , no matter how high a One 's inner fantasy places him socially , he is actually as limited as the lowest when he gets downp120to celebrating it . For whatever our fleshly futures may be , or how hot our desires for them , all the practice of our concupiscence can not exceed the cylindrical coolth of our shape . No bulges defame our pure elliptic curve , no indentations . We do what we can , then  --  we lean . And as with most widely practiced venial sins , Leaning has its recognizable variations ; indeed it is the only preoccupationwhere a One may run a little wild among the various . There is much fashion and preference of place , those who rate the pastoral over the urban , et cetera , et cetera ad infinitum . Leaning in crowds is least sinful , and evening occasionsof it the most common , from intimate soirees to those huge quasi-public affairs , in places of extravagant decor , which are the ultimate of the vulgar . Leaning by Ones , that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious offense , since it affords the most multiple sensation , having in addition to the preponderantlysocial pleasure above , all the extra delicacies of more refined angles of inclination , at what point one turns off one 's electrical field , and at what stage one does actually permit  --  touch . And in what arc of oneself one submits to it , until that final , oblivious moment , achieved only by the most devoted or the more agile , when One and One ellipses manage to touch arcs from top to low in such rapid succession and so simultaneously rocking that their continuous curves seem for one moment of ambiguity  --  a single line . And having already the reverse advantage of caste , we have also these possibilities of misalliance and miscegenation which make Our world a livelier place to live in and gossip about  --  such as the lung-dreamer 's taste for the postcard type , or the actual sight of some great , fair heart-One going off into the bush with some dark little exoticker . For , due to our transparencyand sameness , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexions , and most of us can spell these out pretty well . We feel that this is the gracep121always granted on the other side of sinfulness . For , even among Us , there has to be some way to tell . And finally , there is one more possibility  --  certainly by now you will have thought of it ? Since it vitally concerns me , I shall approach it gradually , as I am able . For , should you ever come to us , you will see well enough how , from one world to another , these modesties cling . Wait , for instance , until the first time you have to turn off your electrical field and just stand there . Whereas I am utterly hardened to that , and  --  alas for it , in my world  --  to much more . But let me now go back to the spectacle of me lying there prone in that glass house in Bucks , hoping that as I talk , what I am hinting at will steal over you , in mutual embarrassment . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dream . Well , I was lying there , trying out my humilities , such a whole arpeggio of aches that there was no use trying to poultice them up one at a time . What was needed was a whole lovely web of dream , and I knew well enough where to find it , having done so more often than I care to say . Finally , I gave in . I began , in the usual way , the usual interior imaginings . When I tell you that I had no allegiance to one single organ , you may guess that there was indeed something very wrong with me . For a while , as preamble , I did entertain myself with visions of myself with heart , myself with lungs , et cetera , all separately . But very quickly I advanced  --  and here began the real dreaming  --  to a vision of such a being as . . . Such a Being . . . as might have , inside itself , such organs . . . and in such an intertwined congress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . such a being as in fact might have them all . So far had I come then in dreaming , that one would have thought this sufficient of evil . But  --  no . Are you beginning to suspect ? I fear you may be , but in the wrong direction . You are thinking perhaps , that in all the categories Ip122have n't mentioned your reproductive ones ? True , but not because we do n't know of them . We do envision these , but as the most vestigial of organs , in no way  --  as the other organs might still be  --  pertinent to our way of life . And though even these poor primitifs have their devotees , the latter Ones have no status among us and are indeed considered  --  Well , they are called  --  silly . To be a One of these worshippers is scarcely to be venial , merely ridiculous . Or have you guessed that I was n't quite truthful when I said that we never lie down ? Well , I was n't , but only out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Ones who manage to do so before we can push them back into the lava stream of Return . The majority of these do it because they ca n't help themselves . Now and then we have a few rakes who prate of leaning in that position , but this is mere senility , and is quickly taken care of . The overwhelming majority of us elect to elide permanently before we reach either of these pitiable states . Once an Ellipse is down , it 's Out . And now . . . I must . Now , since our flesh is at least cognate , brood with me , tremble over the abyss of such a One as I. Even to imagine such a supremely equipped being was not enough for me , a being having within it a pleiades and more of organs at their music , or , if you prefer  --  and as we were reared to rate it in comparison with our veils within veils  --  such a monster of the lowest obscenities of matter . No , I had to be One to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had had the arrogance to dream  --  So . Ah ? Yes . I had become a One who could in fancy assault the holiest  --  our pure Outline . At night , such an army of incubi and succubi attacked me , such nightmare visions of how that most perfect of curves might be contorted , that although as yet I had n't the vaguest of preferences toward these appendagesand indentations , and was even affrighted to envision any being who might own them , much less myself , I had forp123safety 's sake given up leaning altogether . Later on , in those months when I was listening to your signals , I discovered among Us a little band of Others like me ; I was not alone . But I must confess it fully now , and of course now that I am Here it is easier . In Ours , I was without honor . I was one of those whose imagination dared do violence to the very form decreed for us in perpetual onus . Yes , I am that One . I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exquisite relief it could be , this lying prone ! Especially must it be regarded here , I mused , as that dear posture in which one smiles backward at the anxieties of yesterday , lulla-lulla , and can perhaps even anticipate a change of shape one might just have the luck to earn or fall into , on the morrow . Above me , on the shelves , were the picture books of all the fauna here down the geological ages , those great plates I had so pored over during my early incubation here , wondering which of those shapes would turn out to be Yours  --  and in time , in the foolness of time , perhaps Mine . Although at that period I had been unable to focus on the print of the descriptions , each large plate was accompanied by enough small ones to give me a fairly canny idea of each creature 's habits , habitats and foods . Nothing gave any suggestionthat all these magnificoes  --  I had after a few days persuaded myself not to regard them as terrors  --  did not exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " now . " My real shock at the sight of all this  --  all these wavingwaterfalls of mane , saurian extensions , anthropoid pugs , rhino-ish craters and cattish patterns under which the pure oval had forever vanished  --  was not so much at the extremity of the exaggerations , as after a while an intense irritation , then a degrading melancholia , over the piffling scope of my own . How wee , shrunken and ignominious those defamatory little sins-against-the-curve such as I had been able to imagine.  |p124In  the face of this grandeur , I was scarcely a pervert at all . Once I had got over this , I had to buckle down to an important question : when presented a choice of all this imperialgrab bag , which shape would I choose to become ? Try as I did , I could raise no enthusiasm to be any of these creatures , much less that lyric rush of self-discovery which had been the lecher-hope of my small dreams . But the primer had certainly promised a change . For hours I pored over the herbivores and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to any conclusion other than that , if it were left to me , I should fancy a little fur . In the intervals , I searched in vain for pictures of that Lava-stream which must produce them , but although I kept forever coming upon mountains which almost lifted themselves from the page , and vegetation-rimmed tarns of a certain mystery , there seemed to be nothing akin to Our all-embracing system , and not much coherence that I could descry , to any . There was a day when , suddenly noticing a preponderance of eggs , I brooded over this at first wistfully , then almost angrily  --  they had promised more of a change than this . I had no choice really but to trust them . So , when the dialogues started , I kept my own counsel , in time came to understand my delusion , and began to be taught my real profit . The shape I would sin under was not going to be left up to me ; this they call resignation . Almost as with us , except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was One creature here only . And as I lay there now , I practiced ever newer dreams of this being , manufactured out of fresher , more sophisticated dissatisfactions  --  give or take a tusk or two , subtract a horn there . And after an hour or two of this pleasantest of siesta occupations , I made an accordingly new discovery . Posture ! Perhaps only a One of an essentially gyroscopic people , used to the luxury of moving pavements in whose trolley grooves We may in/dine all at the same comfortable angle , can appreciate how basic is posture here to the rhythms of philosophy , and indeed to the practice of ideals . How sensitively I was getting to understand you . It was not wholly comfortable then , to lie too long prone . And no sooner had I discovered this , than I felt myself pulled powerfully upright , as eager for action as if I had just bounded out of the crater . At home , my line of action would have been ready for me ; here it took only nominally longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , I approached the door . At this point in my educationI had never really seen one up close ; what has instantaneityto do with doors ? Answer : it learns to reason itself through them , just as you , by reverse process , will soon find yourselves flashily able to do forever without them . At a certaindistance , I found that , even when thinking the most lethargic thoughts and overcasting myself with the heaviest feelings I yet knew , there was still an unnatural tension betweendoor and me , which boded ill . Then suddenly the source of it occurred to me ; my electrical field was being opposed by another . Even their doors wear them , I thought . And perhaps not only their doors , perhaps all other objects which might offer resistance of any kind are required to be clothed so , while they themselves walk nakedly , proudly among these obeisant ; what aristocrats they are ! And I  --  ? And I. When Here , do as Here does . But be sure to emulate those who are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confuse me with low-grade matter . It requires only a particularthought for us to discard our Field , the trouble being only that it is such a particular one , and illegal too . Perhaps it would n't work as well here . Taking a cautious breath , I found that since the last time I had practiced this heresy , the wholesomely coarser air of Yours had so clogged the finer pores that I was enabled to sustain a thought without fairlyp126recognizing that I was doing it  --  and that this furthermore seemed to add substantially to my weight . Sure enough , shortly I began to feel the familiar chilliness which always comes of lowering one 's protective field , and happening to shiver , this inched me slightly doorwards  --  and sure enough , the door inched slowly and equally toward me . Some thoughts must be illegal anywhere . For good measure , I made so bold as to half hum it , meanwhile keeping my real thoughts trolleying along a loftier neighborhood ; there 's always some niche of the intelligence that one must keep to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured , " . . . I am . . . an Original . " This time the door did n't budge . But by dint of trial I found that as I moved forward , and only under the influence of this , the door would move compatibly outward . What courtesy , even in inferior matter , here ! Slowly , majestically dipping my angle at a nice compromise between a taking-this-for-granted and a thank-you , I inched myself along without accident , untilthe door and I were in equipoise . I was almost outside it . Outside , on Here . By hook or crook then , I was almost safely through the second phase of my journey . For , awesome as the interstellar reaches may be to the lone traveler , or even to the caravan which must track those Saharas of cosmic dust , there had come a point in my journey when it was the destination which became the dread . Did they really have water in a liquid state ? I could not survive without it . Should I have trusted them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I , molded by the same natural forces ? Not that I was suspicious of their intent  --  but after all , they were only a third-generation star . Young as they were , must one not have a low view of intellectual powers which had taken all of their history to discover other presences , and the possible pulsings between them ? Granted We and They had mutually significantsymbols and meanings , but imagine Our dismay whenp127informed that they still read and wrote ! Could beings like Us , who are in Ourselves practically all electronic meaning , go backward as far as these beings on the other side of their " Milky Way " thought they had gone forward ; could we mutateenough , and quickly so , to touch arc on their planet ? To dare to do this , I had gone against all home Opinion . And so far , with the help of arrangements-in-waiting , plans had gone remarkably . But , as I peered outside that glass door , I remembered my misgivings just a few moments before landing . Behind me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long teardrop of a planet , lay somewhere shrouded as I had last seen it , nestling deep in its filtered atmospheres , a jewel once upon a time massively wept . As I had reined in on Yours , a mere toy ball lost on its cloud stubble , waiting to be picked up again in play  --  my last thought had been : yes , I can land Here  --  but can I live ? Such thoughts as one can have behind a door here ! Just beyond the threshold the air was heavy , but I reminded myselfhow much I myself had changed during my weeks here . When , by infinite creepings I found myself still alive and breathing , no more WHAM 's and the door still courteous , I made the last inch or two ; behind me , the door modestly retired  --  and shut . I had no thought at the time of whether it would readmit me , or where I was going . All the prospect of your world was before me , terminated in the distance  --  according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declining  --  by a pergola . I remained for some minutes as I was , faintly chilly , daring nothing , taking stock . I was Here . I was Outside . And I was naked as the day Yours are born . If you could attach a tiny camera to the eye of the newborn here , would it bring back data more vital than those mechanismsthat hit your moon ? I doubt it , for there is so much more than sight at stake . To understand that first unfolding receptivity , the interpreters would themselves have to be re/born . In this way , and entirely opposite to Us , who slip upward already complete and serenely equal with our craterwatchers , you keep a constant spawning of what you call " ignorance . " And the drama of learning it away from itself , while it battles to get back to what it faintly dreams it surely knew , is what is here called " a life . " In my way I was at this momentanalogous to your newborn ; I was in fact seventy-eight inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world moved in on me so powerfully and I as powerfully mutated toward it , I retain only the memory of its collision and blend . Among all the impressions since , this vague memory  --  as of a lost difference at the back of " now "  --  is the least describable . Yet I feel as you do ; if I could find it again I would have something of utter value . What I describe is the momentafter . Though this was my first free view of your world in what you so endearingly persist in calling the round , I was of course already window-bred to the gently mammary landscapebefore me , and to its verdure . This latter I had already seen in the photostats , often in forms fiercer and more variant ; in fact it was by gazing thoughtfully back and forth first at these then through the window that I had gained a composite of what plant life is here . We too have our trees , archaically preserved under glass now , since with the reversal of atmosphereand our refinement of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complementary gaseous relationship as they and you . Indeed , they are our living treasures , visited in museums as you do your dead ones . We like to watch their pause-poise . Other plants we have too , but never except under the most severe guard  --  as you occasionally guard flame . Grass , though known of  --  ah , indeed , indeed , indeed !  --  is forbidden , and hopefully extinct . For , in the seamlessness of our chemiformicallypaved cities , and under the ever-spreading , plasticmildness of buildings which have been taught to repeatp129themselves whenever necessary in units of fortified ground granite and repressed marble , we have been for some eons safe from sight of terra firma , but even in seamlessness , there is the very danger of seam . So , it was no wonder that I gazed for minutes at that wildernessof chlorophyll which would have been both treasure and enemy at home . Although I was by now enough coarsenedin my components to be able to amble along and under that green burning in mutual toleration , to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , though , just as you do in the performance of unnatural acts , I have taught myself not to flinch . In any case , I can not resist returning to what seem to me the most marvelous museums of those green forms  --  which even on Here too are not really random or rampant , but unutterably fixed in their pause-poise  --  and indeed may be the basic natives of eternal everywhere . As I gazed there , already past that other crater-moment , I knew that the scene before me and around me was not the only one in your world ; such a mistake I have never once made . I already knew that in and among all the delights or abysses of what you , when you have tamed it , called landscape , and we , when we have conquered it , terra firma , the elements are the same . Still I gazed . Just in the foreground of those changeable ozones they call air here , a smallish tree was turning over and over its paw-shaped leaves , gray to green , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palm up , palm down , but any advances that were made between tree and me were mine , and at this I felt somewhere within me a certain squeezing . I stared on . Such jewels of the variable are offered you daily , and were now being offered me also  --  such jewels as I could never in essence hope to touch . Above the tree , in perfect ellipse , a cloud reigned . Pause-poise . Everything was moving here , and yet stood at same . One thing I have learned here which I never could have learned at home  --  wherep130sameness never moves  --  and I think I did so at this moment . Palm up , palm down . People are the wilderness . I looked away , and there , just entering the pergola , were two of them.  |p131AND  one , though of a certain meagerness , was a One of us . I had no time more than to make out that the other figure , tall and shrouded in black , was certainly of another order  --  for at that same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in my haste to meet them , I overstepped , not having properly learned how to bring my movements down to your scale . It might be thought that creatures like us , able to transport ourselves at a rate that appears to you instantaneous , and across distances which to you are scarcely short of infinity , must be moving about all the time . Think again  --  and it will be obvious to you that the reverse side of our instantaneityis of course  --  a monumental stillness . That 's real balance and real personality as we see it , a personal whatness , not nearly as dependent as you on a personal where . Contrarily , You , still exploring the minutiae of distance , still roadbuildingon both ground and air , are naturally obsessed with movement , from posture changes on up . I understand that the youth of Yours , in the days before they dreamed of motorbikes  --  and got them  --  used once to dream of sevenleagueboots . As a self-propelling creature , I in effect had these , and on Here you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is simply not enough . It scares me even now to consider where I might have ended up , had I been without the preliminary training of the weeks in the glass house  --  possibly off the place altogether , and in some reach to whose beings even Outline is unknown . As it was , think as small as I tried to , in order to squeeze myself down to those miles which for me were as much the final particle as molecules were once those of your matter  --  !  --  they showed me a map later , where I landed . Later , it was at first thought I had landed at Durham , but when I described the perch on which I had found myself , the consensus was , " Oh no , not that Romanesque ! " Forms of buildings , and indeed many other inanimates , are intensively classified here , whereas even the muddical sciences make only the most simplistic classifications of people  --  not yet having decided , except in the most primitive ways , which is subordinate to which . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be my lifework , to compile such a dictionary of people forms and natures as would be possible only for a one who remembershis One-ness . But that 's by the way . Let us return to my boots . There exists , they told me , somewhere less to the north of my starting point than Durham , a cathedral town which , they added parenthetically , has one of the loveliest of medievalstreets , most homogeneously preserved . ( One learns to expect these stoppages of what they presume to call historicaldetail in the sublimest conversation . ) Be that as it may , they have a town in which there is a cathedral called Ely , on the main tower of which there is a kind of heavenly veranda-porch , ledge or abutment , on which climbers may exit , to stand amid , above , below and on the stonework . From my description of the latter , this is where I found myself standing  --  whisko-flash  --  from Bucks . The street below , its roof peaks all very harmonious , appeared to be preservedp133in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all I know ; I saw none of them , since it was raining . Water in a liquid form they had indeed . I had already seen their sea , of course , but had never in my life felt that luminous shiver-shine-spat on my integument . We are not that intimate with the elements . At first it was divine  --  under those tiny punctures , never had my skin felt so personally mine . But with the new ever comes the newer here . Though we do not have bodily temperature up to yours , I could swear that , hard by the tower there , while the gray winds swatted me to pinker , I had my first sensation of it . Meanwhile I poised there , not knowing either what to do next or how to assure my return to Bucks , having no idea of its direction , or as yet of any , on your scale . Surely they would be out signaling for me shortly , but the roving communications system we shared must be far too grandiose to pick up such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher above me than I was used to ; as for the ozone , its extravagant blue had altogether disappeared . I even had a moment 's nostalgia , now that I had friends here , for that cloud-strewn evening when I had first landed , beamingin on a steady chatter of signals , bang on Bucks . Above all , I wished myself dry again , and no matter what reprimandsmight be my lot , in front of that pair whom five minutes past I had left at the pergola . That pair , that forever ill-assorted pair ! In that brief , snapped-off glimpse , what I aspired to be was nevertheless brought home to me . It is one circumstance to aspire to difference in general  --  a kind of yammer and snuffle to be somethingother than what one so boringly is . Miles across the ravine from this is that other circumstance , when one comprehends , in those layers of oneself beyond where the words are made , the truth of a difference which no effort of sight , touch or sound may ever bring more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gorgeous second when , asp134still little more than a voice and a weaving of limbs , there is knitted into its flesh forever a sense of the difference betweenmere object-mass  --  and You . From then on , I understood the nature of two-ness , at least where I , or a One like me , was one of the pair . I had only to recall that picture , imprinted in me as if all of me were total lens : one of Us , however poor a specimen , standing next to : however bundled , half seen and possibly unaverage also  --  one of You . From then on , I better than understood how a One and a one make Two ; I began to take for granted that things were so and had always been ; I began even to find it harder and harder to conceive that things had ever been otherwise . . . elsewhere . Along with every transition made , I have had to fight to remember it . For my greedy prayer , never told truly until this moment  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely personage of the second dialogue  --  my greediest prayer is not to change wholly from a One to a one , but to stand somewhere on the Gibraltar of between . To stand in the suffer-tickle of all the various , and yet remember the Calm of the Oval , if not feel it . Would that not be an altogether new race of sports ? Do n't answer . Hear me out . I stood there on my ledge , pretty much between of things as it was , and considered what to do next , meanwhile accustomingmyself to the aches of surface intimacy . Remember that until very recently I had lived as a creature of suspension , vibrationally inclined toward this or that surface or person but formally never touching any . By the very nature of Our being , we are thus exempted from having to know where we are ; there 's no need for it . On Here , the surfaceintimacyache performs a very necessary frictional function , as can be seen by watching any a one of you fidget . It keeps people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ledge was hard , the air buffety , and the rain which minutes before had been like silver sunshine to my outline  --  was now rain . Also there was my temperature , now much exhilarated , and even , it seemed to me , ready  --  for what actions I had n't the slightest . The multiple sensation of all this is best described for you as a sneeze with no place to go ; in fact I recall worrying whether there might n't be future danger of developing rather enormous feelings too far in advance of the body mechanisms necessary to vent them . A constant trouble of adult intelligences getting themselves born again  --  or however you want to term it  --  is that so many of their early fears are later authenticated . But back to my ledge . Below , the air , though clearing , was also darkening ; it must have been what is here called both closing time and opening time , and all along the street there were black rounds bobbing by in singles and pairs , and sometimes spatterdash or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was positivelyfascinating to watch , and for me of course , uncannily Outside-ish , which is the way with Us when for whatever reason  --  and indeed there are not many  --  a One gets out of rhythm with his groove and is put to One side until he recoversit . Because of this  --  and included in it a positive sadnessfor the older sadness  --  I did n't watch for too long . My impatience to get back to Bucks was now uneasily confused with my impatience to get down  --  down there , to where the people were . Apropos of this ( and of the cheaply eternal jokes on the errors of identity likely to be made at first crack by visitors from elsewhere ) , I was never under any misapprehensionthat umbrellas were people . There 's no denying that , on the staircase of matter-to-energy transmutation , your metamorphicstage is rather low . But certainly no a One in his right Opinion would ever confuse you with any of your arti/facts . I rather think you must have no idea of just how strange you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance of itself , reminding me that I should never find out the amount of my weightfulness here until I practiced it . No sooner said than done . My temperament , evidently a strong one , made little distinction between the practical and the unavoidable . I decided to jump-fall . Rather fearfully , I let myself go , softly concentrating on no other destination beyond " I-down . " I found that I could slide gently down the span of that thought , approximatelyin whichever direction I pointed it . Tentative as I was , the process took quite a while , during which I had time to reflect . Since I still felt no sense of direction in the smaller sense  --  that is , Yours  --  it was possible that maps and compasspoints of the sort I had seen in the photostat animal books were a universal need here , for the convenient portage of which you yourselves , vide those books also , no doubt would have long since developed pouches in your persons . It struck me that I might already have done so myself . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found myself in an odd difficulty ; since the last time I had done this , my vision , with woeful inefficiency , seemed to have reconcentrated itself in my upper end . There was no longer any use in trying to see myself whole , but by a number of anglings which may have looked rather flirtatious from below , I managed to check , finding , so far , no violations . But just before I came to rest  --  about two feet above the pavement , against the rosy panes of a sweetshop  --  a question , a monster question which to date had never unfolded itself during the entire course of my adventure , now did so . You on Here may be better able to meet this particular questionsince , no matter what you think of Yourselves , you have had to get used to alternatives in every direction . But fancy a world which believes itself unexcelled except by thosep137beings beyond the Beyond who may have achieved total circularity  --  in which case it wo n't matter . Fancy a world of creaturesso at One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger " is expressed as " another a One like me , only grayer . " Fancy , in other words , a world of creatures who swarm like bees toward their own beauty . For these , even to frame such a question was an impertinence . But , nevertheless , what were You going to think  --  of Me ? It was now fairly dark , just before the lamps were lit , and nobody was passing . I hugged the pane , against whose rosiness , effected by glassine paper lining , I had perhaps even been attracted , as butterflies are to their own blend . Butterflieswere diurnal ; where did they go of an evening ? Where does a truant One go when it has run away from its glass house ? Yes , deny it as I would , I could see there were potholesin the firmest character . For I wanted to hide . I found that facing my vision inward toward the window was a help ; since I could n't see them , perhaps they would n't see me . Perhaps this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window and its contents . At this time , as you will recall , I could already read your finer print , and in addition to the instant way in which We could already compute languages generally , for Here-purposes I had been teachergroundedin two of your principal ones . When I say " compute " you must take this literally . This is another great divergence between Ours and Yours which no doubt is already clear to you . Consider . Among creatures already so used to appendages as You , the development of pseudo ones , or machines , was predictable . But where any talent or performance of value is attainable , We would never think of letting out to an appendage what with a little more fiddling could be embodieddirectly in Ourselves . And so we have done . Learn how to fly a hoodinkus  --  and perhaps to fall with it ? Run a byjiggerby  --  and perhaps have to run after it ? Master thep138controls of a thingamagooly , and one day find ourselves  --  ? What shortsightedness ! We do all these things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , I saw to my delight that the piles of stuff there were dotted with little lettered flags . At the same moment , Candy ticked up in me , in response to the substance I saw there , then , " Revise : American for : Revise : Sweets . " Any comprattler can do this . And it was going to be more than useful fun to be able to tick " Umbrella " when confronted with one , though this is as far as it goes . Spell and parse we can , and poet too . Sometimes , since we are beings , we have been known to produce responses we have n't even been set for . But we know better than to confusewords with meanings ; consider your pronouns . But , as real communication , all written language is dead for us , to those of our vibrational Order a mere playing of harpsichords . But some of us still took pride in the performance of the obsolete , which is what so often happens to anything turned over to the machine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spoken languagewe of course had n't had in the memory of any a One . The voiced labials , though troublesome to produce from within , can be practiced very successfully . Diphthongs pose no problem , if long enough to bend . My real difficulty is a slight but constant curvature of the vowels . Meanwhile , I had n't an idea what the stuff in the window was for  --  that sort of thing is a concept . ( And that 's computationfor you . ) But the signs , in all their pretty , pointed Gothic , and each attached to a heap of counters of a unique cabalistic design , enchanted me . I am one of those antiquateda Ones who can not pass up anything in print . I read them out , voicing very slowly , but I thought correctly : FIZZERFRUIT : NUTTIE CRISP : TREACLE TOFFEE : SHERBET BON-BON : RASPBERRY FUZZLE . Directional signals ? Then why these paper twists of color ,  |p139whorls  of ribanded red and white , alongside ? Gaming counterswere a possibility ; as Ones of a total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I studied a jolly neat little pile of beige and brown strips combined with nearcirclebits inside which ever smaller concentrics narrowed to nucleoles of white  --  meanwhile pleased to find that my enthusiasm kept me at a convenient levitation of some fourteeninches from the ground , and that , with slackened winds , my pink was fading , making me less visible than before . Plumb center of the window , the largest placard said in plain Roman : LICORICE . Quote on the tick , there came withoutwarning , " Lickerish : lecherous . Ex. : Lickerish bait , fit to ensnare a brute . " " Silence ! " I said to it . " Who asked you ! " But the monkey had already quoted , as a matter of fact from a part of that dear book of yours , my first one here . Milton : John . I stared , unbelieving . The signs , admittedly incomprehensible , then were street lingo , or perhaps even those scabrous rhymed ditties sometimes fancied by our postcard types . From far down the street , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely registered , for I had caught sight of a mound at the back in which the pieces were darkish mauve and heart-shaped  --  and then it was plain . Some in other piles were greenly luminous , yet others brownishly studded , and it was these exotics which had put me off , but here and there , as with the heart-shapes , I recognized shameful old dream inhabitants I knew . What a hiding spot I had chosen ! In the public street , these replicas . Good God then , this was pornography . Shortly , of course , I came to my sin-senses ; it was a miracle that I had n't confused worlds before . The licorice was actuallyof help , its short-long strips so suggestive of what transcribed-soniclooks like on tape . From then it was but a jump to my own earliest communication lessons here , and then top140the real if rather more boring significance of that bow window , those chromatic little models , so kindergarten neat , those strict little pedagogue flags . Of course , of course . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nicely done too . Gradually , my violent alloverflush of complexion , worse even than the winds had brought , subsided . What polyphonies of transfused meanings were possible here !  --  though I fancied I caught some miscalculationsof interval . But once one had the clue , the whole business fell into line . It was merely some bit of theory , qualitativelyillustrated , as they could do so well here . It was a symbol-signal lesson . Of course . Color-count-read . Again , what politesse , perhaps to the foreigner , perhaps only to the primitives on its own streets of Here  --  but all it did was make me feel homesick in a curiously compound way . Homesickness is of course to feel both Here and There and to feel bad about it , and since I was truant from both it is no wonder that mine was of a certain complexity . As is my wont , I tried to find a compound word for it . I was alone on a dark street , in a dark town , on a dark world  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touchless . Voices coming nearer failed to disturb my grim reverie . I was Out of touch and To blame . That 's where I was , and I had the name for my feeling . I was suffering from uniquity , which means to be alone and bad . The best cure for it is a bit of friendly conversation . Round the corner came a flying wedge of it . Remember that I was from a world without corners . To this day , I remember the exhilaration of it , my first brush , in a flare of voices and steaming mackintoshes , with a company of Youse . To shouts of " B'lloon ! " I was pushed one way ; with answering cries of " Blimp ! " and " Where 's its ruddy gondola ? " I was pushed another . I saw nothing ; because of some ancient danger response I had n't known to be in me , all my pores hadp141set closed . I gave myself up to the rocking motion with which I was being passed about , in what seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell , as I was sent from spice-grubby being to being , and all this was not unpleasant  --  perhaps the tossing thrill that cat gives mouse is reciprocal . And though I knew deep within me that I ought to be up and away , each touch added to my weightfulness  --  is this the trap here ? And my pores remained closed . I remember it all , that blind game of battledore and touch-me which showed me the weakness of sleep dreams as against waking ones . To evoke it all I have only to whisper the talisman : " Round the corner You came . " Suddenly there came a noise from the shop , and a lighter voice , one of them emerging . " Boys , boys ! Stop that ; you 'll break Mrs. Porter 's window . " It was a voice nothing like my mentor 's , who had as oval a voice as ever turned space into music , but it was certainly somewhere in the same category . " I 've ' all a mind , " it said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left out in the rain a bit . And alongside it , a smaller voice said , " Oo mums , whatever is it ! Oo mums , is it an advert ? " I felt myself to be against the windowpane , blushing in my blind darkness for all words ending with that syllable . Whoeverwere the Boys , they had let me go . Then , to my surprise , the larger voice said , " Do b'lieve she 's right , and is it ever lovely ! " These words , said so tenderly , warm-cooled me to a tremble . Whatever I was to them , here , I was approved . I felt an internal moisture . The pores of my dark began to reopen . " Just with your pinkie now , love , " the voice continued . " You boys stand back and give ' er a try . Ever so gently now , ducks . Turn it around , do , and we 'll have a look at what it 's selling . " As yet , I had n't met up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A One is a Has , or translated : I Havep142what I Am . But now , trembling , I felt for the first time a soft meeting of flesh and flesh , a meeting fully half of which is the shivering toward it . One stroke barely grazed me , the next tapped . And when I did not move , the next  --  pushed . Indescribable . As it left me and I sensed it returning , all I meant to do was to lean toward it . All within me , of past and future history , did that . And being familiar with the former , you 'll have guessed what was bound to happen . I overshot . Next stop , St. Ives . And found myself , as was proper I suppose , in a bramble . I lay there prone again , and badly scratched too ; curiously enough , this sensation was not as indescribable as the other . As I lay there , I found myself describing things in general here to an imaginary audience of Ones  --  posture was breedingagain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , there is a morality which keeps correcting people back to the mean . This is not a moral instruction but a fuzzical process , best described by telling you that wherever there is touching , there appear also to be brambles . I put them onto the nature of the latter quite graphically  --  as who could do better at the moment ?  --  but left out the other joy , finding indeed that all realistic memory of it had vanished . And I was careful to flatter my audience  --  all those Ones back There who were awaiting my message  --  by assuring them that although you on Here were constantly tailoring yourselvestoward our Serene by every kind of cutthroat , cutpurseadjustment , you seemed unlikely ever to make it . This was pure guesswork on my part , frankly devised to frighten off any large train of followers until I had personally done the discovering  --  any pioneer would feel the same . But how interesting to note that to ward them off , I chose what actually would have attracted them , just as it had me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really Law  --  was after all unknown to me , and from now on I was to wander ever deeper the sharded shores of its split infinitudes . No need to describe that to you . I was merely becoming more qualitative all the time . Gradually , as the night wore on , sight was restored to me , though again localized at the end of me which seemed to wish to remain upright . Perhaps , I reflected , this was providential , so that if my form did develop according to whatever the native outline was here , it was intended that I be saved from the daily shock of seeing myself totally . As I stood up , this time somewhat painfully , I saw by a tracking moon that I was on a hillock overlooking your sea . There is ever a comfort in scenery which has a kinship with home , and I stood for some time ravishing it . Though in mind no longer so serenely elliptical , I hoped to hang on to some of the old optimism . Even a cosmonaut may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while standing on the very brink of the Two-ness he has come for , he hankers suddenly after the non-pangs of a One . But I shall spare you the poem I mooned there . Books on Ours were not only mummified by now , but even during their brief apogee had been severely limited , compared to yours . In our progress , we 'd had all the picture things first , you see , the moving ones first of all . What with having had universal picturacy for so long , books could only be a backward surprise . My poem was an antiquarian one , very full of " O 's " as all Ours are , and much pasted with the photos that , not daring to feel itself above them , it could only hope to imitate . At home I should merely have dropped it into one of the poem-cans that are provided on all main avenues in front of every camera . But here , looking on your sea , I made bold to declaim it , moved by that sentiment which on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a much , but it 's I. "  |p144Then  I fell silent , but remained there looking at that immensityon which the night could but clamber and roll . The sight of the night sea is too urgent for the traveler who has just arrived . ( I see I have given you my poem after all . ) In truth , after a while I became so dizzied by the need to look away that I did n't know what to do ; a thought even came to me , from realms far deeper than posture , that I might even have to leave I-Iere altogether . A One , whose vision is evenly distributed on a form cylindrically perfect , is of course a perpetuallooker-on whose attention to the non-varying never ceases  --  and never thinks of itself as captive . But on a variegatedplanet , the discomfort of such a constant attention would be intolerable . Even with my vision retreated to the upper half of me , this was so . I do n't know what I 'd have done , had n't it suddenly occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " And strangely enough this concept , to me of the purest novelty , did ease me sufficiently , though as yet I could n't quite make use of it . For it must be plain to you that a One has neither front nor back . Meanwhile , I solved the immediate dilemma by thinking up a project ; I would hunt for a less thorny spot on which to lie down . On Ours , all already is projected  --  but by now I was getting used to these little pushes out of Nowhere which came to me as if from the collective identity of creatures I had n't even met yet . What else is mutation ? Turning round and round , as we tend to do , but at the andante pace which had been taught me , I observed that the hillock I was on was actually not far from a house which must have learned to withstand that view better than I could . The inanimate can  --  this is what they are . Between the house and my promontory , a gentler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took to be trees , pollarded like those to be seen from my window in Bucks  --  like those around the pergola . From the pang that this gave me , I had no wish to investigate further.  |p145The  moon had gone in , anyway . I laid myself down , too tired to care that I was now this kind of animal . That grass did n't burn me was no longer a marvel . I had had all that I could bear . And in this extremity , which We never reach , there came to me the possibility that the beings on Here , short of leaving it , must somehow of their own will close their pores and briefly have done with it . In the darkness , I cultivated my own nadir . And for the first time in history , a One of us fell asleep . And in the dawn that woke me , I saw what I took to be Your totems . They appeared to cradle me , looking down . At home , great , perfected ellipses stand about everywhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statuary is of that public sort , by which means we replenish space with the idea of ourselves . You , however , who are always noodling so on the private , seem intent on replenishing yourselves with space . Such holes , such corners ! I was in fact in a sculptor 's garden . I gazed from image to image , long and long , around a ring of figures of which some were blackish , some gray , all of them torturously curve-straight and empty-whole  --  all of them in a constant state of between . It seemed to me that the more I knew about you , from this extraordinary world which seemed to be strewn with your handiwork but for hours and acres empty of you yourselves , the less idea I had of how you really were . At home , a One is always Omnipresent , for reference . And yet it also seemed to me that once I had met You I would recognize you at once , as that image  --  retreat into variationthough you might  --  which I had always known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as we must be yours . Otherwise , how would I be here ? And you , Some of you , perhaps very soon , or even already , over There . Once more I humbly went the round of the images , again seeing many marvelous assaults on the geo/metric , but search as I might , I saw none to bow down to , and this was the odder , since by very nature we have n't got such a concept  --  being unable . Meanwhile , at home , there might soon be rows of Yours , standing rapt in the public gardens , trying not to . These are the true interstellar thoughts . All the rest is machinery . For , as I went , I passed from the outer awes of our mutual adventure to the inner ones . From some mental height far above any I had realistically traversed , I looked down on both our shuttlings and yours , and was afflicted with a tenderness for us both . This is called the cosmic emotion . We have it within Us always , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet I did not know , it would be the greatest cognate of all . Unfortunately , in order for Us to go on living as Ours are early instructed  --  the personal vision , alas , must take precedence . But this is smiled on , since , luckily for the generalgood , all our personal visions are of course the same . Now however , I was in one of your gardens , so mine had naturally more of me in it . And so did the vow I swore . For a minute 's vision , I saw our two worlds in the curve I was used to . Satellites from us are sent out on regular mission ; I myself had once been one of those intently roving lanterns ; at some time every a One must so serve . Meanwhile , astronauts from your side were fizzing everywhere among the orbital gardens . The present mission between you and us was somewhat different ; only a small band of dissidents on either side had ever thought of it  --  but these had thought long . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we would apply our instantaneity , you meanwhile discarding that twonesswhich we , never having known any species but One , so crave . In the face of eternity , neither of us would be going either backward or forward . Change is progress ; regress is change . Both of us wanted it . And what I saw in my vision was that each of us , until itp147met the other , had thought its passion to change was new to the universes ; We to Us were the Highest ; You to yourselves were the First . And standing for the moment between , I foresawthat once an exchange had been made , both would forget how things had been : Elsewhere . How could it be otherwise ? For once we touched foreign atmosphere , adjustments would begin , gradually blurring our clear Outlines . So I swore to be such a cosmic messenger as must never have been before . I vowed to remember  --  and to record , for as long as nature allowed me  --  the journey between . Mine would be no visitor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; those at home would get no satiric tour of your institutions from me . Mine would be a far more basic journal , in fact such an act of personal commitment as could be managed only by a One of no previous personal backgroundwhatever . I would make of my self-adventure such a book as had never been made before , so far as one knew . For , in the history of how a One of Us tried to become an I of You , would not all the biologies reunite with all the philosophies , forevermore ? The history of mutation is blind  --  but I would keep my eye-pores open ; it is so slow that for eons it may seem to stand still  --  but I am constitutionally so quick that I appear to do the same ! Had there ever been such a pilgrim before ? For I , a conscious mutant , member of perhaps the first two species to attempt to perform such a feat under control  --  would record the ontological journey of myself . And since we record without your resort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within . In Our sense I would be the book , just as you , in your memories , are the books of yourselves . I would be  --  Oh arrogance eternal  --  what had never been anywhere . Mine would be the diary of a bio-naut . And such were the muscular effects of my ecstasy , that this time I shot straight up . Ambition levitates , as you your/selves well know , and I was still enough of a One to feel the play of such forces literally . Oh how I soared and skylarked , careless of what dangerously premature legends I might be creating down below . All those weeks of incarceration , plus the recent trials by element , had stiffened me  --  or could it be that I was already developing that characteristic which , abounce on even the fleeciest cloud , would cause difficulty  --  skeletal bone ? A moment 's check , however , convinced me that I really was merely suffering from want of calisthenic . In that brief moment of doubt , however , I had lost altitude . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now how weightfulness was handled here , and that if I were careful to alternate between frictional doubts and positive uplifts , meanwhile keeping the sharpest lookout , I might yet get myself back to Bucks again . For a while I practiced , keeping myself well out to sea , but as the sun began to show itself , sped inland , in a few seconds caravanseraied all of Britain  --  at a height to observe only that in all that rousing farmland and cities there seemed to be no creatures of the dinosauric proportions I secretly still hoped for  --  and then at last saw what I was looking for . In broad sun , a glass house of that dimension makes quite an outcry . I was now so fine on my points that I was able to hover over the pergola , which I saw now was roofed and enclosed at the center of its circular porch , and much larger than I had thought it . Dear ones , dear friends , I said to myself , then  --  in proper mixture : oh dear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ONE was about now . Everyone on Here seemed eitherto crowd together in a mash or hunt for his absolute own of waste-land , our simple formula never having occurred to them ; from the moment a One of us emerges from the crater , an exact field of space , mathematically tailored to his mass , is his for life . I turned away , in some depletion , intending to go back to my furnished room to wait for whateverreprimand must certainly be due me . It even crossed my mind that they might leave me there forever , in permanentdiscard  --  and this notion was again one of those mortalities which were crowding in from every direction to guide me  --  for at home we do not have a system of waste people , either . Just then , I heard sound coming from the pergola . At first , all I could hear was buzz indiscriminate ; then it labeled itself : Voices . I was afraid to move lest I should once more overshoot myself , motion-emotion being so intense here . By a powerful exertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if at an angle dangerously forward . They were two voices . And they were  --  yes ! They were Marie , and my mentor . . . . Another equally strong intimation sent me almost horizontal . They were . . . They . The two voices belonged to the two figures whom I had so barely missed yesterday ,  |p150at  the start of my hectic truancy . Those two figures , then  --  a One of Us and a one of You  --  were my two mentors . My mentors were a One of Us , and a one of You . I began almost to have a notion of the balances here . In an access of wonder I crept nearer also . That much . Mark it for the narrative : a One , forwarding slowly from his accustomary flash-billions  --  crept . " Security report a One sighted over Cornwall per'aps forty minute ago . Then they lose track . " She ! " Security ! Indeed ! " This was Marie all right , in her usual state of  --  state . " Reported managing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I stretched a bit . I thought I guessed whom She was talking about . " A jump ahead , mind you . And security , indeed . One ca n't wait to get back There . You have no idea . " " Haas , that is all I do have . The idea . " " My dear girl . Just a manner of speaking . And One does feel for you . " I had no trouble believing Marie spoke via some strings and a box . " That is , in so far as I can still feel . " Indeed , her voice had changed for the worse , I thought . " Oui , madame . But I think per'aps you mean to stay  --  ' as far as One can still feel . ' " That was a spark of my old lessons ! But what was She after ? What kind of lesson was this ? " Touchay , " said Marie . " As yew 'd say . One ca n't expect to be letter-perfect , so early on . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When One was There . " A silence issued . Then there came such a sigh as I had never heard from Her before . " Elsewhere . " Her voice , no matter what it says , is still music.  | " Dear me , my dear girl , dear me . You 're having no luck at all , then ? " I did not at all take to Marie 's use of this " dear . " " Far as One can see , you have n't changed a bit , " she went on . " Not that One could , you 've got yourself so wrapped up . Of course , One does n't want to pry . " " Nothing  --  major . Sometime , I imagine I ' ave a certain sensation  --  such a delicatesse as I ' ave not  --  but it is not after all too different from what can be experience , de temps en temps , on ' ere . " " If you ask One , perhaps yew 've had all too much of that sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if those of us who do best in the end are the kind who never had too much taste for that sort of thing . Like Oneself . " There was a silence . Then my mentor spoke up in full voice , the richly round one . " So I ' ave ' eard . " There was a silence again . But this time it seemed to belong to Marie . After a while , she did speak . " And how is  --  Harry ? " " According to the rules , madame , I ' ave not communicate . " This came out so rapidly , it might have been in her other language . " Sorry . One did have to ask . You must know Harry 's been trying to get in touch with you here . " Again a pause . " I supposed  --  ' e would try . But you and I are agree before'and , no , that it can not be ' elp if my disappearancefrom ' ere pattern itself on your . Or if ' e ' appen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain , it bound to ' appen , de plus en plus everywhere . " I was listening so hard that it seemed almost as if I were there in the room with them , though obviously here , outside it . Was this front- and backness ? " Agreed . But who 'd have dreamed you 'd experience sop152much trouble that you 'd have to turn back as you did , and hide here ! " " You ' ide ' ere for years , Marie . And I ' elp you . " " For which One prayed for you daily . And remember , One was on One 's way up . One was an apprentice ; indeed , it is alleged  --  the first . Those were the old days . And you are not an apprentice . " If Marie was the kind who was a first , I was not sure I wanted to be . " I was recruit before the war . At Gottingen . The day after the first ' Itler putsch , I was recruit . " " Precisely . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very first group to make the decisions against  --  them . And afterwards , the pride of France . One gives you all your medals , dear girl . But then all the more , this  --  inconvenience . This strange delay . We never dreamed  --  " " Nor I. " She was still saying " I. " I liked that . " Nor that Harry would be so  --  so persistent . " " ' E is ' ere ? ' E is ' ere ? " This was a cry . It went through me . I could have wished that it had at least gone all the way  --  but it lodged . And during the very long silence which now ensued , I felt as if I were leaning on the sharp point of it . This was what came of dropping One 's field . Then , as it ebbed  --  was that . . . pain ?  --  I thought perhaps the two of them had gone . Why did I always  --  ? Such things never mattered before . But no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you please . That pro-noun . " " Merde . " It was only a mutter . " Quelle vraie salope . " " And the French also . Now that One can compute it quite easily . In any case , the answer is no  --  not here . Gone up to London . To look for you , still after any trace of you . Then , we hope , to Harwell . One of our brightest recruits is workingp153there . Just a beginning candidate . But she 'll have several tricky little theses to show him which should help delay him awhile . But after that , unless we can think of something in time  --  we 're for it . One good guess , and Harry could blow up the whole show . For , where do you suppose , my dear , that Harry plans going ? A great tribute to you , of course . After that , Harry expects to chase across the water again  --  back to Hobbs . " But that was where I 'd been told I was going ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Arry wo n't ' ave to guess , " said my mentor . " You ca n't mean  --  " Marie 's voice was all vibration . " You could n't have . Told him . Or is that why you 're having such  --  Aha . And all those widow 's veils of yours are just a  --  " " You think I need to tell ' Arry ? ' E guessed . An " e never say a word . No matter ' ow long I work in the tower , evenings . No matter what changes ' e find now and then in the observatory . ' E never . Long , long ago , ' e guess . " I began to suspect who  --  or what  --  Harry was . In general . " But then it 's all up with us , " said Marie . " I knew we should n't have used women of  --  your stamp . " Mentor gave a little laugh . " One should never . But no , it 's not all up with us . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's at stake , Harry would n't speak ? You 've lost your mind , poor sweetie . Any of them would speak up  --  they would have to . Just as in the same boat , so would any of us " " Not Harry . " She even pronounced the " h " I used to twit her about  --  her difficulty . " But that 's too extraordinary ! " said Marie . " Or would be . " " ' E ' ad two wives very unusual , non ? So why should n't ' e be such a man ? " So I was right . One of the straight ones . A he . A  --   | " Language ! " When Marie 's voice went even higher , whose did it re-semble ? " If you persist in breaking every safeguard , " she went on , " how can One believe anything you say ? Or be surprised that One-ness is still beyond you . Even if what you say could possibly be true , then  --  then why should Harry keep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew the answer to that , dear Marie . I waited for my mentor to give it : " Because I am She . " As one so often does here , I had learned just a little more than they had taught me . But , however  --  and hence my tame Obedience to the next program , the dialogue to come  --  not quite enough . As so often before , I imagined her there , just through the wall , a being longitudinally oval like myself , and pinkish too , not all of the dinosaur size which I had hoped for the straight ones . More to my scale , and with a spot of difference , or , as things went here  --  two . Then She gave a chuckle . First it was only a little purling from those strings of hers , the kind with which she had sometimes honored an error of mine . But then it was a ripple , and another ripple , and finally it buffeted the room  --  how did the wall withstand it ? Answer : like many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on . To me , in this case . " Ohe , ohe . Alors . C'est ce que je  --  So that 's it ! Eh bien , eh bien , at least I still have what it take to laugh ! " And She was off again . " So One observes . Or could do , if you had n't got yourself up in  --  the way you have . " " Arabique . A chador . Tres chic , non ? And a good way to hide . " Another time , since hiding was of interest to me also , I should have pondered this further , but I was in the grip ofp155more important questions . Questions here are terrible . No wonder we do not have them . " Highly unnecessary , is n't it ? Since Harry is gone . " Marie 's voice was rather elegant , or at least , slender . Like whose ? " To return , you say . " " Possibly . Meanwhile , what is it you find so funny ? " " A private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality , are you . I insist . " Between a flute and a bumble . Very aristocratic , of course . " I do n't like to ' urt your feeling . " " One has n't them , dear . Not any more . " " Pardon . Then you will not mind my asking . . . when you disappear , Marie  --  " " Ye-es . One has forgotten all that now . " " Oui . Pardon . Then you will not remember . . . that when ' Arry come back from Egypt  --  " " All that has faded , my dear girl . As you will find , if you are lucky enough to  --  to Ovolve . " Marie was putting on airs , as converts so often do . " Ah , oui . But since I ' ave n't been so lucky  --  you forgive I amuse myself  --  that ' Arry did never take the trouble to go looking , hein , for you . " And Mentor gave a final low laugh which did her no credit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together ! But I should n't at all mind having a straight talk with this Harry . Who could n't be the one I was being sent to next , since the very pronoun was distasteful . Who must be one of the other kind . Who must be one of those whom the two inside called them . A " he " was a Harry . And it was jolly likely that , if it were left to those two , I 'd never get to meet any . I saw the likelihood that very definite limits were indeed to be put on my education here . Good God . Was it possible that enmity between the genders here was such that the two never met at all ?  |p156A  host of questions assailed me . I managed to put down all but a few , meanwhile rather nervously watching a squirrel who regarded me with his bright wink but came no nearer . I shifted a bit so he should not mistake me for a boulder , and listened again for sounds from within , but heard nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home there is always a supportive hum , not to the point of music but very filling nevertheless . I preoccupied myself meanwhile by imagining a sort of being to whom one might pose all sorts of questions it would be a waste to put to that pair behind the wall . Serious questions , to be propounded in some solemn but comfortable environfrom which the brightly-stupid , the silly-unsafe , would be barred . Nothing personal . Serious questions being of course those to which both sides already knew the answers . At the moment , I bent to consider those more foolish ones in which vitality so often secretes itself here . Why was it Marie 's reedy voice annoyed me , for instance , with a resemblanceI could n't or would n't identify ? And why it should so matter to me that , of the two in there , a One of Us and a one of You , and both my mentors , which . . . ? An appendage voice suddenly interrupted what were perhapsall our meditations . " Security reports a One returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said my mentor 's voice . " I 'd better go see . " " Not until you 've revealed just what 's behind those veils , mind . Do be . . . just a weeny look now .... " " Touch me at your peril , Marie ! " " Disgusting thought . We do n't , you know . But you 're the one who 's in danger . Psychologically . Taking the veil is just what they used to do in the old days . Women who 'd led a  --  full life . " " All the better you do n't come any nearer . "  | " Temper , temper ! As for the rest of your ensemble  --  All those pockets . How do you ever expect to lose weightfulness ? " So they did have them . " You 're not supposed to be eating , reading or yearning . You 're supposed to be in a quiet non-corner , talking hypothesesto your  --  " Here Marie gave a short cough . " Nombril . " I computed rapidly . Navel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know our reticences . Well then . Whatever can you be keeping in those pockets ? " " Old enthusiasms . " I thought as much . " Ah ! . . . Mind letting me . . . have just a weeny  --  " " Loin d'ici ! Non ! " Another cough . " Just testing . Quite a good reaction , really . Touching departs first , one is told . But you still seem to be suffering from quite a lot of  --  poetry . " " Pardon ? " " For persons , places , that sort of thing . Any sort of irregular  --  surface attachment . " Converts . They never get things right . " Ah , oui . Very  --  poetical . An ' I suppose , they ' ave no word for  --  " " No , no , no . No ! Whatever you may be thinking of  --  no . " " Fi donc . " But this was merely a mutter , followed by a pause . " Alors , tell us Marie . . . touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it go ? " " That 's a good sign . You said tell Us : " " I mean the change . How does it start ? The change . " Her voice was hoarse , but still hers . " Why , amnesia takes over at once , of course . We would n't dare remember . Once leave for good and all , Here will disappearaltogether . " For some , maybe.  | " You never look-6d the miroir ? During that time ? " " Doubt it . Never was one for mirrors , much . " " Ah . All that time  --  what you think of ? What you were  --  for ? " " Not for , " said Marie . " Wherever in the universe would that get you ? Against ! " Sunday was Marie . " Ah , I see , " said my mentor . " I even . . . remember . And I  --  I am still too much  --  So . So that 's it . " I stirred uneasily . At home , where talk was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for conversation , yard after yard of it , reverberating , profound . Here , where talk was a necessity , there were only these papiermdchedetonations . " How you can see anything , with all those clothes on ! " said Marie . " There 's no doubt you look better , cherie , without the clothes you were in the ' abit of wearing . And now , if you excuse me  --  " Cherie . She had called Marie by my name . Language on here could be gall to the taste , gender a confusion of the mind . Take the whole of their reversible world here ; let it burn in its own nasty green glare . This was an emotion . I was almost sure of it. "  --  but what 's that noise ? " Mentor said sharply . " Squirrels on the skylight . They always . " It was I , of course , somewhat to my embarrassment . I could say that the darkly overcast wind blown up suddenly within me had blasted me up there . Or I could say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternatives than I had thought . Both were true . I peered down . Through the heavily corrugated glass , I could perceive only areas of light and dark ; as for myself , as yet I scarcely cast a shadow . In this climate , it wasp159probable the natives themselves did little more . Again a sharp sense of home curved me . Likely nowhere on this planet were shadows cast with the perfect black lacquering of Ours , that teardrop planet whose shape is so devotedly matched by its inhabitants , and whose climate , standing ever at the semitropic , is of the texture of a melted-down smile . An undulatingrow of Us , our black alter egos peacocked out all at the same stance behind us , some with the shine of patent , others with the patina of velvet , is something to see . To watch this interplay is a spectator art with us , some preferring the brilliant contrasts of the siesta , others like myself inclining toward the curvetting nuances of dusk  --  both of these hours of course being artificial . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consoled for his pallor by looking behind him . " No , do n't go yet , " said Marie , so close under me that for a moment I thought she addressed me , yet I could barely distinguish , below , the lump of stillness that must be she . Or the other : She . Which  --  was which ? I said it to myself over and over like a pain . And this was strange , since , by logic and listening  --  the latter being a lot better than the former  --  I thought I knew . Hunger pains for the absolute are the natural consequence of a world having so many alternations , but it is the nature of the absolute itself here which is the more interesting . It is what one absolutely knows , but can never get confirmed . But , if I could manage to break the skylight  --  " Time for me to go and practice . " She sounded so depressed that I was reminded of certain times at home when , having already dared to think of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond power or destiny . Yet , once a Here is penetrated by thoughts of elsewhere , it is never the same . " Practice makes perfect , " said Marie . She cooed it , or was trying to , yet I seemed to know  --  thep160way those of you who have absolute pitch can summon an " A "  --  the pure tonelessness that such a voice must have . " But perhaps you need a rest , eh ? " she added . " Maybe you ought to table the whole idea of changing . Now , now , do n't get excited . Just for a little two-time . " " What is that ! " " A small paraphrase of one 's own . When you do get to Us , as One is sure you eventually will , you 'll find us rather good on paraphrases . It makes for fresh reverberation without autointoxication . And we really have no non-mathematical name for the time factor  --  a concept that ca n't exist anyway except in the presence of correlatives . " " You never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where One and One is One , " said Marie , " a One has no trouble . " She was either ignorant or giving herself airs . We do have a name for the time factor , indeed as single a name as it is possible to imagine . What would a world such as Ours call such a factor ? We would and do call it : Once . I repeated it to myself , and even giggled ; as I bumbled between worlds , it was language which would help to keep me lamely  --  I mean , sane . And Marie is a phony , with a telephonyvoice . Out on There , Once is certainly what We  --  what They  --  say . We . They . And then , right here-there on my corrugated glass perch in the bright morning air of Bucks , I began to shiver and shake . I began to shiver as if this pleasant valleydom before me , on whose bright demesne I could even see , mute in the distance , a scattered few of that most comforting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outermost bounds of the universe perhaps , or even that worst of them , the one presumedto be outside those . I even fancied that my tremors were accompanied by a chattering sound which could never quite be caught of itself and stopped the minute I did , likep161the footsteps of those who had feet . Yet , so far I had nothing about my personage which should make even a whisper . And then  --  suddenly I understood . Nothing much was ever understood on Here except suddenly , and I was even doing that , with a feeling like the rising of hair upon the integument  --  if one had hair . Consider how it all fitted together . Consider , for instance , how umbilingual I was about language , how ambivalvulent  --  how at one moment I despised it and at another it was my savior . I was betwixt . Regard how very little , or certainly less and less , I seemed to be living in the present ; as I thought of it , it seemed to me that they scarcely had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host of other things that an eavesdropper on a glass roof had ought not to do , being arsy-versy enough as it was . I was betwixt and between . We  --  They . And I saw quite clearly that , unless I could become more of a You , or less of a One , this circumstance might be the walking-floating hellholewhich would follow me everywhere . " Besides , dear colleague , we have such a lovely mission for you . It will fit right in with your circumstances . " I gave a start , having forgotten that everybody has them . Circumstances . " That 's no squirrel out there , Marie . " " You 're just nervous . Do let me explain . " " I am rather full up on mission already . " " But this one is instead of . Just for a  --  Just for now . " Hmm . This is the way their present always goes . " Who believes in now , these days ? " Mentor 's voice wasbitter . " What peasant ? " " Good-oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christian era , really , the better to think of the world to come . And what with you scientists helping  --  what one ca n't understand is how such a doctrinaire as you should be having such trouble at getting there . "  |p162How  wrong she was , she would soon see . The answer was that a One does not believe in a now ; a One has it . Our Now is not doctrinaire . One merely can not assume it unless the whole race does , since it comes from a sameness in every . circular pore and bath of living . And I could show her a race of Ones , in such a sempiternal Now  --  ! Almost I yearned to be back there , sweet-sucking that circumambience . " No wonder you succeed , Marie . You ' ave faith . " " One always has had . " " Oui . To be sure , not always in the same thing . But , chapel to cosmos  --  you ' ave it . " " From now on , it all will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So One thinks . " I wish  --  " Mentor sighed . " I know what , dear  --  that you were like me already . " Mentor gave a laugh . " No , it is more complicated . I wish .. . that I wished it . " And I wished that I could jump down through the skylightto tell her that such a mingy , gray pod of a convert  --  for surely this was the which and which of the pair I had seen  --  was no true model of Us . Oh to be sure , mutation the other way , toward You , was my mission and my yearning , but the truly large spirit can honor its beginnings , as you yourselves honor the gills and auricles which fathered your breathing , the unicellular yolks which only latterly became your hearts . And I wished she might see a line of Us , serene as barques born all of the same sailmaker , acurve on the eveningat the gilded hour when the refractions of dust so bend the energies of light that for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Keep looking , dear , and no doubt it will occur . " Had We really ever been so  --  like this a One ? The vanity of an elliptic being is delicately elongated ; it seemed to me that Marie 's bordered on the fatly circular.  | " I am . " Ah , Mentor . Look at me . And in after-moments , I have sometimes wondered whether that might have been the one in which her own Rashly educationbegan . " That 's no squirrel up there , " she said . Beneath me , I could see the vague bundle which was Marie move closer to the other darker one . " Could it  --  " That voice could n't whisper . "  --  could it be  --  Harry ! " " Harry ? " Her voice could make arcs . " Harry would come straight in . " Then I was not after all as straight as I should be . " Besides , he 's afraid of heights . " Even in Harrys , then , there was room for flaw . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribulations I deeply foresaw here : all the corporeal trials of the spirit , the dangers and bloods of a being which in its privacy retreats , a small , classic anima brooding upon its own waters , but when abroad even a landscape of the quietest , non-ravening trees  --  is still animal . If I could but choose to be that half here which  --  " You 're so concrete , dear , even in misery . Not very womanly of you , I must say . " " Au contraire . " " Oneself is neuter , of course ; I mean neutral . " " Of course . I always ' ad in mind that you were . " " Whereas One used to fancy , in fact , that you were just a teeny bit  --  " " You do n't need to come any closer to tell me . " I fancied I could see the gray blob stealing nearer the dark . It was maddening . Then I remembered that sight had been concentrating in the upper half of me . To aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  yes , horizontal !  --  then appliedthat part of me to the wavy corrugations on which Ip164stood , but these remained adamant , stubbornly loyal  --  except for one crack of irritation . Fending off a squirrel , I remained as I was . As far as I could make out , the dark blob was standing its ground.  --  just an eeny  --  we-eeny  --  " " Bug off ! " " Language ! " shrieked Marie , but from what I could see  --  the sun at high now aiding me  --  she came no nearer . At that instant the sun must have come altogether out of the clouds here , ennobling the substance on which I lay to defend its owners royally against me , with flashes that went through me as if I were a scabbard . At some later date , I might brood on the curious interaction here between climate and inanimates  --  almost an alliance against blood-creatures , rather like that of servants who in reality are masters  --  but now I was held by what was going on below . Intervals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our peacefully successive periods of the same being unheard of ; the line of demarcation is not even kept . And now again , I saw a suddenly . The dark figure began moving . It was speaking as it was moving , and it was moving toward the gray . " Pax , Marie , eh ? " it said . " I beg of you . Je vous en prie . Pax . " Was this qualitative ? Was this feeling ? Or , the mixtures here being so mixed  --  ? Oh , the new world ! The dark was after all moving toward the gray . " Language helps to keep me sane , Marie . " So that was where I had picked up this sentiment . " Or did do . While we ' ad our pupil . " I trembled so that on the roof the very pattern of the sun itself  --  of a star  --  was dispersed , altered by my small but stubborn body . At home , all our aim is to order it otherwise  --  that the force of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I  --  and all the little band of us andp165you  --  are meteors whose paths intersect at equilibrium : oncenow  --  then must soar onward into opposing nights . As she had forewarned me , the generations on Here do this also , in an equilibrium that never rests . While , on Ours , as I had cautioned her , all generations are created equal in dower , and throughout their tenure remain so  --  rising from the crater and returning there in perfect quadrille . A sadness interfuses each world . Choose . I trembled that I was even thinking such thoughts . On Here , even the very facts are never still . How then , when nothing waits , can meditation be revered ? Meanwhile , below me those voices went on a-murmuring ; talk might sanify , but the converse of these two was circular enough to push even a nonconformist out of his Opinion  --  never had I seen so many questions permitted to exist without answers . I arranged them before me as best I was able . What was the new mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose somber shadow even the faithful roof above her could not take upon itself to hide ? And , to me the subtlest , what did Marie fancy was there ? For , just as Marie still had much more of the old planet about her than she would admit to , I too still had a good deal of instantaneity about me . And one a thing I had learned quicker than light  --  though like the light here , it kept leaving me and returning . The shape of the questions here tells much more than the answers . But a minute later , as that low , passionate monologue resolved itself on my hearing like drops of fire that burst each into its own picture , I almost wished myself if not elsewhere at least away , out of eavesdropping , perhaps on that green pleasance where , only a mile away but as if on another orbit , cows were to be seen munching in their ownp166mirage . Sooner or later on this planet , everyone wishes himself a cow . For , as She spoke I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what it meant to be , among many , a one . Yes , once , in my first dizzying gulp of print here : O dark dark dark . But that had been a blind dark brought to general majesty . What I was hearing now was the shriek of the particular , going toward darkness . Or toward the pale , non-particular of There . In brief  --  for I can scarcely bear to repeat all of it  --  She stated that the trouble had all begun with my own lessons . While she was so carefully arranging for me my affirmations of Here , she had begun to grow doubts about There . This is always a danger , I surmised , with alternatives ; too big a bagfulof either , and one pokes a hole to let in the other . For as she inventoried the characteristics of this world for me , she had begun to make a ring-around-a-rosary for them for herself . " After forty years pointed toward elsewhere , what could it matter , Marie , this little exercise in farewell ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made our au revoir , the day when I had learned to say " I. " It was just then that she too had had a suddenly . It had come upon her that the words themselves , all those jewel cases which she had been airing for me , would no longer be needed by her , that not only they but all their contents  --  which now sparkled so green  --  would soon by her choice be over and gone for her forever. "  --  and then , ah then I find myself in such a bramble . " Bramble ! " Everything I look at , Marie ; it touch me . And everything what I touch ; it look at me . " Yes , that 's the bramble , all right . One after the other she described them , these blandishments . Little pictures flitted past me , small images struck as if with one molten drop of that organ which , as they tell it ,  |p167beats  like a brazen forge within them , magic unto itself in the center of their wilderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I could spare her those cherished sunsets , rather pale to me after such sun carillons as I had passed on my way Here , though I had begun to understand that delirium for the daily which can clang upon us once we know it is going  --  or it isgone . Her plaint about the plant-in-the-window left me cool also ; I have already declared myself on plants ; since they will outnumber us all there is no need to mourn . On the contrary , and though I might marvel politely here at grass which did not burn one , I would let it go at that , knowing what it still can do , left to its own . But most of her apostrophes were to the smaller domestica , some so insignificant that they fell through the screen of my computation altogether unidentified . In the span of one day , according to her account , she had wept equally and uncontrollablyboth over memorabilia of the past and objects testimonial to such a present as can be caught here  --  from an ancient pumice stone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here had scraped her heel in the bath since her girlhood , to the patch of trillium on the way through the woods to the tower where all her scientific efforts were conducted  --  to the stockpot on the stove . This last , on whose to-and-fro , from organ to organ as it were , she rather dwelled on , did rather ticklishly affect me . But taken altogether , what  --  " Sentiment ! " said Marie . Fool , semi-demi convertedly quavering fool ! No ! What disorder !  --  from which comes all their danger . Their tolerance for the inanimate here  --  on whose sneakiness we keep forever vigilant  --  is past believing . Whatever of it they do not positively venerate , or worse yet , even help to proliferate , they let run incontinently free , eventually to rise , mountains of it and they knew not why , in their own dreams . Enmity  --   |p168as  we already knew from certain faint tintinnabulations of our instruments  --  they keep for among themselves . " Yes , sentiment , " said my mentor in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardens the memory . " " How low your voice has got ! " Marie tittered . " Whereas mine . . . that is , One 's  --  " Good God . No wonder I knew that pitch pipe of hers , its tinny " A. " It was also mine . " You never did weep , Marie ? " she meanwhile was saying . " During all that time ? " " You know quite well how busy one was , collating all that inform  --  all very well for you scientists , but some one has to org  --  "  --  and someone ' ave to ' ave money . " "  --  ye-es . That 's a thing One has rather missed , on There . We do gamble of course , but only with the oddest curved little counters , designed to slip away of themselves as fast as accumulated . One does wonder if it would n't be possible somehow to immobilize  --  " Up there on my perch , I began to laugh in the very special way we do , of which even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , We may not feel , per se , and we may have but one carefully constructed climate , status-quo 'd to such fine tolerances of the same as your engineers would not conceive . But we have our outlets , arrived at after such implosions and gravitational collapses of which all but the most trusted members of our steadied universe remain unaware . Miles out to star you can hear us in the laughing season . And even off-season one is soothed by the characteristichum-tune of a planet always at a cool , cerebral bubble  --  the smooth , general laughter of the only very slightly counterfeit sublime . Such a planet can take care of itself . Indeed , I should n't be surprised if , ententes cordiales to thep169contrary , emigration should after all take place only One way.  --  and remember , Marie , you 'd so much sympathetic company , right up to the time you took to your groove .

I try it last evening . There . " From the thud , it must have been a book from a very large pocket . " One hopes it helped , dear . " " Very settling , " said Mentor . " To the settled . " " Ah ?

Maybe is such a melting word . " They 're let run so free here , " Marie said crankily . " On There , the shadows are so beautifully organized . " She'Il learn not to use that word.  | " Marie . . .

" Ours is n't circular ; Ours is ellip  --  " Good God , let not these two get into philosophy . " I know , I know . But let me demonstrate .

To concentrate , this time I look at ' Arry 's new star object , the brightest of nine , and my favorite  --  " " Favorite ! You are still  --  " " Yes , I admit it . Personality to the end ! Listen about this 3C-273 , Marie . It is the nearest of the far ones . It is so far that what I was seeing last night ' appen before the birth of the solar system , yet it make so much brilliance that any amateur can pick it up in his speculum  --  And listen , Marie ,  |p172this  vary rhythmically , in thirteen-year cycles . Maybe the proper star for a woman ? Hmmm ? " " You 're not thinking of  --  still ! " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Ow nice to see that you can still not think  --  whatever you 're not thinking of . No . . . but  --  " She broke off . " Honest to God , what the matter with me ? When I think of what we ' ave gone and done , the secondary sex , the unprofessional one  --  I ' ave such ' ot flashes of adventure . And then suddenly . . . an icicle grow in my throat , and stick there . I feel such a laugh coming on , of such frivol as I ' ave never  --  " She stopped short . " I think to myself , change-of-life , eh ? Who should be surprise we are the ones to think of it ? " Her voice bubbled . Then there came from her such a laugh , higher than Marie 's , not as supersonic as that chorus one hears in the season , but still cast to the all but disappearing pitch of it  --  the cool , aleatoric music of all answers which have no death in them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was I going , or coming ? I looked down at myself , no discoverable change . Then I noticed that , beneath me , the solicitous crack had widened . I had forgotten about that subtle traitor , the inanimate  --  that counterspy , that informer . But now , within a small circumference around what was going on below , I could see . They were just down under  --  the gray figure and the black . Seeing often adds very little to the believing here  --  at least to a vision accustomed to rotating at the center of a cyclorama which in turn intersects Others of the same , all this united perspective  --  aerial , isometric and linear  --  of course operating as usual , as One . But I could discern that one of the figures was standing relatively still , and one  --  though with a movement visible only to those trained to receive the perpetual molecular shimmer ,  |p173was  very slightly dancing . Difficult as it is to stand rock-still  --  there is no better word on this planet  --  the black figure was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human I the figure of Marie may have been invisible . These dialogues are not unknown here . " Listen  --  " said the dark figure again , who of course might not know that the listening attention of a One , cocked foreverat the angle of the gyroscope , spins eternal . " Listen , Marie , what you see when you look the night sky ? " And it spoke in two voices now , both the piping and the soft , the dark and the cool , like some oracle intent on ringing all the changes possible between One and Two , but unaware , of course  --  a sudden gust of my own laughter shook me  --  that above it , there peered the outsider , who was  --  I felt a slight flesh change . Could mutation come even while laughing ? The outsider who was . . . I was . I was Three . " I tell you what ' Arry see , " She said . Three-ness is nothing compared to the passage from Onenessto Two-ness  --  a mere sophistication . I listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dears that these beings were , at least in their spare time ! I watched him stumble out among the higher-speed environments to potter with his basic fizzical alphabets every evening : " No , " he said to himself , " matter could not be totally annihilated into energy ; yes , the universe exploded bang into being thirteen billion years ago and is continuously expanding ; no , it had no beginning , and , steady there ! , will endure forever "  --  and I saw him fall like an apple , every generation of him , on the heads of those beneath . Meanwhile , the black veils did not tremble , but from within the demand was repeated , not waiting for a reply . " I tell you what I see , " it saidShe did not see the horses of Apollo up there , not any more than the Harrys did ; the romantic was no longer herp174line . But so bright was her description , charged with the scorn of non-seeing , I fancied I saw that classic heaven . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but always the opposite ! Beneath me , she unrolled such a vast panorama of all the prospects she had never had , that I altogether forgot the staid picture to be seen through the crack below . This is your general power , to extend yourselves in a way we can never , by the airiest hazard and opine . And by that reverse grace which acts in all universes in some way , it is a power which comes to you by very virtue of not having a fixed Now . So she described  --  with what she said was bitterness  --  the long range of circumstances she had never been fully allowed , had meanwhile greatly despised , and now hoped to leave behind her , forevermore . What experiences , what illimitable Urals of them , their peaks bloodstained or rainbowed , she cast behind her  --  and ahead of me ! ( And what a strange " forever " they had here , which lacking even a moment 's tranquility must attach itself at once , greedygreedy , to a " more . " ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had seen ; despite her gender she had not been wholly underprivileged . I heard the plaint of children , not all of whom were hers , but all of whose cries were on her conscience  --  and dimly osmosed toward me , I thought I began to computewhat was a child . The notion of " kill , " even within the species , I have never had trouble with ( it being what we are in absolute reversal of , as we are from that other more melting opposite which we are forbidden to name ) . For , like you , we know from the crater what is forbidden us  --  in the way that all beings perhaps know the forces that have produced their particular shape . As for birth , barely mentioning it other than as the circumstancefor which her kind was both anointed andp175chained , she passed it by as no mystery to her  --  just as the eye of a needle might neatly engulf a camel , meanwhile convincing itself that the camel had swallowed it . Birth by any biological means  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course what we laugh at , in the season . I understood of course what was happening ; She in turn was having her vision . She too had a certain fidelity toward her origins . As for death , that question-answer she had so touted , I could n't make out whether she willingly left it behind  --  until I reminded myself that , just as my vision had had some of You in it , so would Ours have a place in hers . Matter of fact , being rather personally on Here myself , I wondered , a little hoped , whether among the great grab bag of things she saw to enumerate , there might n't be a Me in it  --  but she merely finished with a sigh as great , and as if politely , once more said , " What do you see . . . Marie ? " I knew what I saw at that moment , in our joint sky . I saw that home planet astride the reaches which a One might yet return to , that long teardrop of grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be barred . " What do you see in the night sky ? " And Marie finally answered her , with that single word which even on Here has its dignity . " We . " But , in the brusque way events kick up their heels at eternity here , I was given no time to reflect on it . A happening was indeed interrupting me . For , to my harrow , I observed that the crack in the roof was widening , although , clever criminalthat it was , it was managing this all but imperceptibly . And now I must confess to a naivete so utter that a You may laugh at it seasonably all the year round . I had no idea that the mise en scene was so complex here . When a One of Us has a happening , everyone nearby turns to face him , affording just the mild degree of simultaneity which will be comfortable ; we are an attentive race for whom it wouldp176be unthinkable that a member of it need step over any of the lintels of life quite alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full quadrille . This being so , advice , since never needed , is never given , affording us a sweetly open laissez-faire in place of the fierce huddle of privacy for which you must be forever on guard . But the shocking simultaneity with which events public or private were permitted to engulf people here would never occur to us . The possibility that , within the same quarter-mile moment of duration  --  or frequently much less , what with the cram and stretch of your allotments here  --  people might drown at sea , strut the sidewalks , dice away their patrimony , feast , strangulatein hospital , or simply be gazing sun-focused at a tablecloth , had never before crossed my mind  --  much less that all over your planet , perhaps your universe , people went on stewing in the same sort of broth . My mind ! My cleanly conceptual mind , across whose pure plain there had never stalked more than one neat aberration  --  must I not mourn forever that calm savannah , that zoologicalsilence ! Into which slid Two-ness , the snake . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the variableworld branched off as one approached . No sooner had I resigned myself to the dangers which ran alongside the admissable joys of a world where objects were let be unbridled , than I was confounded with the appalling disorderof its events . Up from that melee , a couple of numb thoughts in counterweight promptly immobilized me : We  --  have no accidents . They  --  take no responsibility . So , meanwhile I sat on my crack . And below it , though this could n't go on forever , those two  --  tow , two , two  --  went right on talking . Would it be the same for two a Harrys ? I looked down at the ground . No , as yet I was n't afraid of heights . But it seemed probable that to stay where I wasp177might be a part of my gravitational training  --  especially where the listening was so instructive . So , lying as flat as a being so curved could , and careful not to make any movement which might further inflame the treacherous substanceI was lying on  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my first appendage . Ah , it is a one thing to sneer at your mechanical ways of extending yourselves  --  but this  --  ! Conceive of the occasion ! After such passage of time immemorial as could not be mathematically figured even by a Schlovsky-Schmidt , a Wheeler-Oppenheimer , not even if one added to these the services of a Heisenberg-Hoyle plus even this year 's most brilliant qualifierfor the Cambridge tripos  --  after all that time , a One , of the most illustrious , unprofaned incestry , saw his first violation of the sacred outline . And it was no longer a perversion . It was n't even a dream . I knew what the appendage was of course , or thought I did , via that ever-resourceful book of animal plates , plus  --  though no squirrel was around for me to check on  --  certainfugitive memories of the small fauna which had patrolled before my glass . And though I was a bit middled about the number of such proper to creatures here  --  yes , it was what I thought ; of course it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draperies , while I reddened  --  really now , must it ! Coyly , it seemed to linger a moment , weaving slightly against the figure of the being to whom it belonged . Yes , it was graceful . It was also in a way repellent . The sight of what one has always been forbidden is always a little sinister  --  and its performance , alas , inordinately clever . Finally  --  it extended itself ; oh what a length , after all ! Finally , its owner spoke . " Au ' voir , Marie . Shake ! " Then , in the usual two-ly , which I ought to have beenp178used to by now , I saw another oddity . Marie 's color did not change a whit , unlike mine . She was after all going the other way ; ships that pass ! But in that rather stout gray outline of hers , whose texture , tell the truth , was still far short of transubstantiation , what did I see  --  just above the median horizontal and parallel with that waiting appendage  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a failure of arc that strove at once to repair its own extension , but for a quivering moment was unable . I watched in fascination  --  and of course , a vestigial sense of duty-watch . Then it was gone , leaving her form as perfectly inflated as before  --  and me gazing down on my own . Except for color , I was  --  as was . But the crack was now smiling to the width of an inch . I quickly looked away . " Think yerself pretty clever , eh , yer nasty bit of  --  ? Wotchertrying to do , give Us a setback ! " Uh-oh . At this from Marie , my computer section , which has always had a weakness for dialect , positively chattered away at me  --  seems it had suddenly had revealed to it that Marie 's origins were not all she had pretended them to be . It went on to point out to me that neither were my mentor 's  --  or at least rather obscure , certainly not native to this region . And reaching a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covertly me , whether the fact might n't be that , by and large , most dissidents anywhere were either foreigners  --  or runts . In a final burst of ambition , it rattled off a request that I pose this question to it directly , promising me in return an answer which would not be by and large . Somewhat shaken , I turned off the connect . Since we do these things in our Own person , the relation between a One and his computer section is not separate , but neither is it equal . If this went on , I should have to get rid of it , maybe even let it go off on its own . Ever since coming here it hadp179been getting above itself , and this despite a rapid downgradein performance  --  witness its slapshod job of work on my vowels . Machines tend to do this on Here . Something in the atmosphere . " I apologize , Marie . " No matter what rude hints from mechanical snobs , here was a lady  --  a discrimination perhaps outside their realm now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the way , was still extended , indeed the only part of her to be seen , she being almost directly beneath me . And by now , this appendage seemed to me  --  what with that geometric progressionof appetites which is here called " getting used to "  --  it even looked to me now rather sinuously beautiful . I found myself almost shy of learning its name . But since I could n't go on calling it an appendage forever , and it was certainly not an umbrella , I turned on the comput-put again , which thereupon snorted , " HAND ! " omitting the usual accessorydata , and  --  with what untold effects on my progress , not all of them bad , I daresay  --  went out of order for the whole afternoon . I know better of course . Only fools are onthropomorphic about machines . But , since I have been here , I find that though I like many of them very much , I ca n't tell one from the other . Something in the atmosphere . Hand . A hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to detect its function , whereupon it withdrew , perhaps to spare my sensibilities . With my usual stingy ideas about the differentiationhere , I was of course assuming that its function was limited to  --  one . " Sorry , ma vieille , I could n't ' elp  --  but is that material you 're in  --  really protoplasm . May I touch ? " Separatism already . Their egos are enviably powerful . " You saw the prospectus ; we all did . " Marie meanwhile retreated past my angle of vision . " And kindly stop genderingp180me . These Outlooks have their Onfluences . Wiser if you gave up French altogether . " Really , what a pill . I scarcely dared look down now  --  the split in the roof had stretched to a smirk . " Okay , bebbee . " " Take that word . . . away . And no , you ca n't touch , thanks to One-ness . One 's got a sort of all-over electrical vest takes care of that . Very comfy , too . " " You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ducky . It 's forbidden . Besides , One ca n't . " Which is the great contrast between our forbiddens , and yours . " There 's always a loophole , " said She , walking toward Marie . And a one  --  and a One  --  to see through it . Maybe she was looking for it now , for I could no longer see either of them . What they were in must be a corner . O philosophy . If I fell , would it be round a corner I came ? " Marie . . . " came from below . " Marie . . . look up . . . do you see what I see ? Straight up ! " That lovely adverbative . I was enchanted . " Hah . No yer do n't . You 'll not get One to take one 's Observo off you till you 're safely away . " " Helas . That may take quite a time . " And now , were we all back where we started ?  --  which we would be , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crack grinned up at me , reminding me that I was a three . " We have Time , " said Marie . " For once and same . No more trickles . " " Marie . . . listen . Very beautiful of course , all that Weing . But mebbee for me  --  you think possible I ' ave pick the wrong elsewhere ? For you , fine , but for me , mebbee I would be better off in one where  --  "  |p181Where  there were no pronouns at all ? But that 's the beyond ! Marie cut in quickly . " You 'll feel better , when you get to  --  America . " " America ! " America ! There was more to corners than I thought . More things than You came round them . " But that 's an ordinary elsewhere , Marie ! It 's on the planet ! " Everywhere is an elsewhere to somebody . When less precariouslysituated , one might point out to them that I , formerly of Ours , was here . As for America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a sort of way-stop for all those whose pronouns were in transit ? " O . . . is it ? One 's been away . . . Anyway , it 's Orders . " " Good God , Marie , " said my mentor . " I hope you girls ' ave n't fuck things up altogether . " I flipped the connect . Not a sound . Then an agitated one , " Turn me or " Everything is on Order , " said Marie . " Except your lack of progress . Luckily We can make use of it . " " But I am suppose to be going Out ! Off ! " " Later on , " said Marie . " That is . . . later on-on . Prespresently , you 're to stay as you are-are . " Pedagogue . " And what I am suppose to do there ? " " You 're to  --  help us with the migration . You 'll be right in the center of things , do n't worry . In fact it 's called the Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way you are . " " Jolly right , dear . But One could n't do what you  --  . " Here Marie rather choked . " You 're to  --  head off Harry . "  |p182There  walked before us then the greatest silence yet ; in fact , it was a silence that was positively running , in which , both parties below , maneuvering away from it , came to a stop directly under party a three . " As I  --  am , Marie ? " " Right you are . " ... Then , I ' ave to inform you  --  " Here a sound unclassifiable . Or no . If a person could have a  --  If in a person there could suddenly be a crack  --  "  --  I am not . . . as I was . " The silence , which had finally run out of hearing , came back . " O , " said Marie . " One had an Omen . All along One had an  --  One does hope there has n't been a rather dreadful  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at me would certainly tip the tumble to ' Arry . " " O O O , " said Marie , and I caught myself just in time , at the cool , pushbottom signal which turns all on groove constantly toward One-All . " One needs Others . OOOO . " A four-digit alarm was doing better than expected ; in fact it was well on the way Out . But she relapsed , crying out , " One ca n't do it alone . " Ul-loawoun is what she really said . They mix-multiply their vowels like equations here . " Per'aps it shoulden ' be done alone , " said my mentor . " Migration . Per'aps it should never . " Why then so invigorated her voice ? " Affinities can be dangerous . " " Have no fears on that score , " said Marie . " The next lot is coming in perfect quadrille . " " Nevertheless ! " What joy in her voice . Joy is a statement put like a question , but only for the sheer pleasure of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' istory'ave to ' ave its ' eroines , eh Marie ? "  | " Not where One is concerned , " said Marie abjectly . " Not without drillection . " " Then , look UP ! " my mentor cried without warning , as if on a countersignal . " Look at the sky , the skylight ! Look at our pupil . Our Hero ! Look at  --  HIM ! " The crack yawned obediently . I saw her appendage waving . And then O. How does one ever render the raiseen scene here ? By what dots or symbols . . . +  --  x X  --  + x = . . . by what loci , foci , axis transverseor conjugate can one describe and total it ? O Appolonius of Perga , who first named Our curve , O Great Geometer ! How shall I render a what-where-who-how which is always all happening all at the same different ONCE ! O pi in the sky ! **35;5990;TOOLONG remember . That 's how . All four of us spoke at once . And here is how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O-nathema ! Spy in the sky ! And you , you traitoress  --  who have turned both your pupil and yourself into a  --  " SHE , MENTOR : was waving and calling , and heroically pronouncing all her aitches . I : crouched over the abyss . I crouched , yet I felt on tiptoe . I felt such a melting feeling , and the computer said never a word . Ah you dears , you dears , I said to myself , and the abyss echoed my fears . " Hypnosis never , " I said ; " hypothesis forever . " How far I had come ! For of all three was I not the most various ? Finally , crying aloud the name of Ours , I  --  did I jump ? Was I pushed ?  |p184And  here we all come round again . MENTOR : " Allons , enfants de la pa-atrie-e . . . " MARIE : "  --  a MAN ! " I fell . The crack said : CRACK.  |p185T  ET me now , in gentler perspective and more according to your unities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . In falling , I had grazed my teacher , not to the injury of either of us , but dislodging those veils which covered the top of her . My first attention , however , was directed toward Marie , who was still discharging vituperation in a steady , mewling outrage . " Stop ! " I said  --  and this was cruel of me , for We never quite do , of course ; motionless as we may seem to you , we are always a trifle on the tremolo . " Turn off your Observo . " This can be done only on command . " And go spin in a  --  in a corner . " " How far had I come indeed ! Yet when I tried to look straight at my mentor , I was so abashed that I altogether failed . Slowly , a swelling of my pores  --  brought on by my fall  --  abated ; technically , I could see , but between Her and me a somatic mist still prevailed . It had nothing to do with the bodily shames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions , now answered , had vanished like itches scratched . Actually , a one of these remained but I had forgotten it ; if behind those veils some change in the being there had been hidden ,  |p186what  could that mean to me , who had never seen its arche-type ? You  --  or at least a one-side of You , were here . I was in Your presence . The ages , sand over sand , had shifted so that we might encounter . And a one of you , in whatever guise , was surely a surrogate for all of you  --  on the curve that you shared with us how could it be otherwise ? The mist was of my own making ; as You perspire fear , so We suspire awe . Awe is our emotion , the perfect tapering of a civilization in pause . When its mist lifted I would see You in all your opposite . The mist lifted . I saw . There is no O to say it with . There were no words . Of descriptions  --  only deficiencies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparable , yet I had nothing else with which to compare . Even now , used as I am to the crude manners of retrospect here  --  how the moment after forever corrupts the one before it  --  I scarcely ever look at any a one of you with a sense of deja vu . As many as I see of You , I never have seen you before . And though by now I have accustomed myself to those simplifications in which you see yourselves as viewed " fillface " or " prefile , " the truth is that , with a stubborn geometry akin to that of your own artists , I tend to see you mostly in the rind . And now , from the neck up only but at least , I saw you . Horns , tusks , antennae , the great tongues of the giant herbivores , all floated forever out of my imagings , also those stripings behind whose bars the cats forever patrol themselves . I gave up forever all hope of the dinosauric archways , of that affinity of elephant and tapir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for long intrigued me . As for below-neck , even though it were veiled , I could see You were not wingedly archeopteryx . I had no way of knowing whether You were hoofly ungulate . You were a niggle . Youp187were an enigma . The hints of one or other of all of these that would now and then escape into a one of You were as yet unknown to me  --  or that you were a niggle of them all . I saw only You . You were You . I saw that great proboscis of the slender nares ( here was there perhaps the faintest hint of Phoenicopterus , the flamingo ? )  --  ignorant of whether I was looking at it downside up or aft fore , and who knows , perhaps I was n't . Fresh from otherbeing , I saw you . This is the best way to see you , and sometimes I still can . Next , observing the dark strands drawn into a great whorl at odds from the proboscis , I surmised that I might yet have the bit of fur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so unobstrusive , at least in terms of your own reference book . As I stared , the nostrils quivered . Below them , an opening , irregularly shaped but yet of a certain symmetry , tremored wide , then bud-closed . Other planes of bone-flesh might later take on their symmetricalso , but at the moment my vision was untrained to see much past the fact that the classic ovaline was nowhere within you , at least in that part which I now saw . If ever I was to consider you beautiful , I would have to learn to look at you romantically . A classic is a One that may be looked at in toto , or , as We say , in Only . With You , the sight must continually wander . But , strange beyond strange , all the time I was observing this , meanwhile just on the brink of marvel , just over the border of envy  --  what else is criticism ?  --  I did not quite feel You were here , You were behind somewhere . Then , suddenly , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pore fought whether to flee or stay , suddenly there opened  --  the pit , the jewel  --  what great signet of what great cabalist was here ? Even in the midst of a great and primitive art , as your faces so often seem to me , one tires after a while of these blind witnesses of thep188primordial struggle and yearns to stumble upon a sign of Our latterday consciousness . Now and then One starts , One stares  --  there it is !  --  but falls back disappointed , perhaps so , yes perhaps so  --  but divided now , that orb which seemed to lead both into and away from the dark interior , from the tom-tom dark . Always divided , as is the habit here , as were those glinting pairs of orbs in my source book  --  always divided into two . But this one , situated north of the arch of nose , south of the ledge of the brow , seemed to stretch horizontal , from temple to temple . Had it once been two , melted by too many maybes , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a sentry returning , a searchlight on the rove . I had not known that you had our form anywhere here , except in your copybooks . And here you had it , an amulet set in the very head your primer so values . I must not worship , I said to myself . I must not . Yet it was such a perfect ellipse . There was a scream from the corner where Marie was . This is the trouble with corners and why we are so earnest not to have them , being allowed but one scream in our lifetime , and one  --  but anon . " Oh my poor girl . You 've got stuck betwee  --  een ! " What a state of between we were all in , to be sure  --  why should hers be the worst ? " Oh my poor girl , " cried Marie again . That sort of thing repeated begins to sound smug . Two-ness of this sort can be extremely tiresome , but appears to be what they expect of themselves . " Whatever , ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transitive atmosphere here . Not what are you , but what do you . No wonder they have no strong Now but merely a gaggle of is-is n't actions of various sizes and locations all over their globe . She meanwhile , in one sinuous movement  --  how they move here !  --  but that will come later  --  so rearranged herself thatp189from the center of her veils only that one long , lucent eye in beautiful extent , temple to temple , regarded me . What could be wrong with that ? Yet , doubts of your most tonic variety assailed me . Just as , or in somewhat the same way as I had traveled past Us , and Marie had traveled past Her , she had traveled past You . You , or precisely You  --  were still to come . Or was that long amulet only my own hallucination of home , and  --  incited by the sight of me  --  theirs of their future ? ( What is mutation ? ) Here we all were for the moment , willy-nilly , in our triple vision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as theirs had once prepared to cross moonward but thought to stop there . And thought to stop there ! Meanwhile , what armies , what latitudes impossible to a fixed eternity were crossing here ! Perhaps betwixtand-betweenwas the normal here  --  this mixture being the only in which a One  --  and a one  --  might get past all the eternities , or deep enough in them , to feel , crisscross for a second , what I was feeling . For under that powerful orb I grew a feeling so simple that it frightened me . So simple , the utter fantasticality of right-here , so  --  mortal ! The rod of Here pierced me . I felt such a right-hereness as remains inconceivable before and after it occurs  --  yet is the sensation one hunts for here continuously in all those tempting niches in which they keep its wandering icon ; next-the-corner , around-the-door . In this improbable place-space , She and I had trapped it between us . In it , she spoke , that great elliptic eye meanwhile traversingme totally , taking in me as my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ere we are , " she said . " So this is You . " Are . What can one do with such a moment except live it , and , poised on its thin cuticle , be together the collision that living is ? " So , You are here , " she said . " How unimaginable You are . "  |p190How  was it , then , that she seemed only to give me my I-ness , renewed ? What did I give her ? Long and long , when the wee small hours here are at their true large , I brood on it , not without pride . " The sight of the pupil inspires the teacher . " She whisperedthis , sotto voce , so that perhaps only I  --  Then , in a most businesslike manner , she repeated , this time without appendage , "  --  ' voir , Marie . " And added , at no reply , " Well , I 'm off . One is . " " Not . . . to , to  --  " Marie , audienced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Observo was on again , an ambience ordinarily not apparent except in those of us who are retarded , or otherwise incomplete . " To Hobbs ? Not quite yet . One will leave that to you others . " There was a pause in which for a trice I fancied that I heard space , saw time and smelled thought , in the old unbroken blend . " And to Harry , " she said then . She pronouncedit impeccably , this sentence with which she left him . ( Leavings-behind are legion here , but I am still sensitive to them . ) Drawing herself up tall , she was all veil now , in which only the wish might detect a new-swelling curve . " If becoming a One is the order of the day , a one can not avoid it . But I will drag my heels , my heart and my brain all the way . I vow it . Every step of the way , I will remember . " Remember . In its wake , she repeated , though fainter , that catechism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all We are charged against , but this time in such a confusion of terms , such a changing of heads as to who bled , killed , starved or bore , that I heard only the last word clearly , "  --  is . " Her courage seemed to me improvident  --  and reminiscent . " Untilp191it dies in One-ness , the I will remember the I , " she said . " And will record it . " And I could not speak , for remembering my One-ness . Oh lost , oh lost-lost . But found , found . For , they had it . You have it . You too have the cosmic emotion . We all . " Adieu . " She said no more . I was not surprised . Marie , for all her hibernatory prayers and festerings , had arrived at whatever Marie now was in the old , conventional mole-in-the-dark way of evolution ; Marie was a sport . She , my mentor , and I were of a different breed  --  the conscious ones . We shall become  --  and know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly the lights of the worlds  --  well , it would n't have been for want of trying . When I looked up  --  wherever had I been looking in the meantime ?  --  she was gone . " Was One deceived in what One saw ? " said Marie , impudentnow . " Or did that creature go  --  up ! " We both looked in that direction . The crack , that sly-boots , had all but disappeared now , in favor of the sky , but I was not deceived . As I have remarked in a previous context , I knew the difference between a floor and a ceiling , and all that sky brought in to confuse me made no exception . The crack was still there somewhere . Had she gone up through it ? For the first time , I took more detailed stock of the place , which , in its glorification of the busy-busy , was not unlike our orifices at home , though where at home the powersthat-bewent in for bureaucracies of infinitely luminous ideas , here they hid behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count up to three in anything now  --  were patterning away at a stately rate with those calligraphies of light which meant that the observable world was being masticated , perforated and remythicated  --  the **25;6027;TOOLONG being left , as usual , to be swallowed whole . But in the wall after three , there was  --  ha ! " There 's a door , " I said . Just as remarkable if she went through that , far as I was concerned . Marie was pouting . I meanwhile felt so frisky that I ventureda local joke which the computer had offered me in friendlier hours . " Just came down from Cornwall myself , " I said larkily . " What 's the matter , never seen a Cornishman before ? " By her shudder , I tipped to what the offense was . " Oh not really . You can see for yourself . " Bluff , since I had no knowledge of what there would have been to see . " But I have high hopes of gender . The straightest . " " Should n't wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself to blame . Meantime , ought to complain to the authorities , we ought . Whatever did they have in mind , sending us a runt ? " It is true that my full seventy-eight inches of You-ness was not too different from what I had been as a One . It was equally clear that Marie knew no military history , or perhaps history of any kind  --  including her own recent one . I looked at her so that she curved in markedly  --  corners had their uses . I myself might not know as yet what I was for here , certainly not as steadily as the dear departed and revered . But I knew what I was against , and just as strongly as , a while back , had been counseled . I was against Marieness , and all hypothecation or extrapolation of the same . More intimately speaking  --  oh the advantages here  --  I was against Marie . Yet , I had to get on . All I knew about my American destinationwas its name  --  Hobbs  --  and its purpose  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where I was to be quartered , and who my inter/locutor , was still unknown to me . Unless I wanted to bumble out among the populace  --  which , in the way events were let run free here , might cause anything from fatality to inconvenience  --  Marie was my sole connect . " Dear a One , " I said . " Do not think that this a One will ever cease to be grateful for the part that you a One have played in Our education . " Always talk to parvenus in the most formal language one possesses ; your dignity will that way be preserved , and theirs  --  to their delight  --  created . No reply . She would tend to be suspicious of my good will , not having much of it toward me . Ah , these psychologicals , the air here was simply ringing with them . Then I remembered a plainer fact , that she was still in the corner . " Do come forward , " I said , which released her . " Spin anywhere . Feel free . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of Us from the beginning . " Actually , her texture was awful , in fact visible . " One wishes particularly to thank you a One for the gift of that most useful of phrases for the expression of the celebratizzical and amazingular ; in fact , might One not be right if One sometimes suspects it to be the most supremely useful phrase in all variation ? " Ask for information ; it flatters . A tough customer not to be soothed , or perhaps a fearful one . For the newcomer , as I had begun to take note of in myself , floating clouds of paranoia lurk everywhere . And when I recalled what it was she did me the honor to suspect me of  --  " Good God ! " I said , then recovered myself neatly . " You may perhaps still recall the phrase : good God . " " Aeow . Aeow quite . As One recalls , rather dimmishly to be sure , that 's only the half of it . " " Indeed , " I said , all new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tack . " One would indeed be grateful if  --  if Your One-ness would  --  would consider giving me thep194other half , in that case . One did rather think that , given the hyphenated state of affairs here , there must be also some other phrase , some antonym  --  " " You 'll find it on one Wall , once One is off . One oneself would rather not  --  " Here Marie very subtly spun away from my vicinity , this time ducking the corner ; no doubt about it their curving is very deft ; or is it coy ? They ? " One must be getting off , or rather , on . Well , see You , One day-day . See You around-the-around . " I 'm afraid  --  I mean I 'm proud to say  --  I lost control of myself ; I was evolving beautifully . " But what about my Orders ! " I even wailed it . " The hospitality here  --  every a One is always leaving . I 'm always being left behind , left to myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swervous . I 've never been so much a loner in my  --  I demand my orders ! " How could I have forgotten that a One must never be charged or addressed that directly , Our whole nature being ovoidal , not confrontal . Our ? " You 'll find things here are not so out-in-the-oval as at home . " Her voice was already hypnoid with going ; she was on the fade . Whatever would i do ? i felt myself shrinking to the nothing-without-company that the i so often is here . Luckily , she had a last twinge of her former hasty , botchy self . " You might find them in that little collection of objects she appears to have let drop . Over there on the floor , runt . You seem to be getting all blind behind . " I was , was I ? I. Immediately I felt reinvigorated . I was n't only being left behind . According to the familiar multiple here , I was acquiring behindness in other ways  --  in fact I must already have it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a befront . Scrutinizing me as best I could , so far I found none of the coveted lumps , buds , et cetera  --  but , yes , if rather patchily , the beginnings of opacity . Then , even that interesting new envelopment lost my attention , in favorp195of  --  there it was on the floor , behind behind-me . The little collection . It seemed to rest there in an aura of its owner , its former owner . Indeed , formerness interfused it , perhaps to show me how that emotion could sometimes be located here . The very floor seemed to hold its small group discriminately , if not with positive leaning . They were few , these objects . They were : a one , a two , a three thin little books , and a one as thin but in size more to the folio , a glass-and-silver folding lorgnette whose function and form I knew from our own museum specimens , and two-three to several , slender Ushapeswhose use I did n't know  --  those made of bone having a few humps center-oval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. Twist together the ends of any of these latter and each would make quite a passable ellipse  --  there was much of the curve in her nature . And a letter . Off to one side , not in her aura nor in its own , a blue letter . " Some of her nasty ditty hooks , no doubt , " said Marie . I turned , more slowly than I had ever yet turned in all my duration . How this mean little creature ever once had encompassed all your splendid variations still passed my understanding  --  it not yet having grasped the essence of variation , that she be one of them . Slower yet I turned , filled with such a belching against-ness that I feared the worst without exactly knowing what that would be  --  which is of course what the worst is . Certainly my feelings were becomingfar too filling for one who as yet had no outlets . I tried good-godding but that pinhole was simply not up to my mountainous needs . I wanted to push Marie off the planet altogether , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than the one which had been mine . Just then , in the wall which now looked at me , a jigzag of lights frantically signaled for my attention . It was nowp196harder for me to read such large-scale script , once having mastered the small  --  one pays for every talent here in the coin of its opposite  --  but finally I deciphered the message , a single word only but what a big one ! Tentatively , I pronouncedit , whereupon the wall immediately flickered , in much more modest script : Too Broad an " A , " but then gave me the corrected phonetic  --  causing me to think that if my own comprattle-trap had been half as cooperative , my vowels would by now be perfection . Then I said the word . Then I said it . If all the violences here have such immediate modes of relief , people here must exist under a continual blessure . Turning to befront Marie , I delivered it in a voice summoned from the depths the word itself might have been conceived in . " DAMN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone . Of course , she had already been about to . There was no telling . Experiencemight show , though I was beginning to have doubts on my ability to sort out the typical here . " Damn you ! " I said hopefully , but , the you of Marie already being somewhere in outer space  --  to less satisfaction . One wanted a general statement , broaching all gaps , and individuations . I considered . " God Damn , " I said . " In fact , a good God Damn . " There is certainly some value in being original . Then , full of the energy which accomplishment always brings , I could turn , first to my grieving , then to the hunt for my instructions  --  this paperchase between honoring the bygone and pursuing the foregone being the standard procedurefor any emigrant . Grieving with you and us is almost cognate ; after a while  --  for us almost a full day  --  the empty space closes over the one who has stepped out of line . It is said that you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow to preserve that bit of space as a memorial  --  by incorporatingit in yourselves . If so , you have more room in yourp197crowded withinwards than we in all our vastness of vibration . And if so , you do it , I saw now , with the aid of those objects to which you give so much dangerous function  --  which accounts in part for your trusting tenderness toward them . You use them to hold yourselves down in rooms when you are in them , to hold you there even when you yourselvesare gone . Dear foolish ones , dear rich ones , though you must know as well as we do that the inanimate can have no permanent allegiance , you will even give to it your individuation . And grieving may therefore quite honorably attach itself to the dear one 's objects , this being the responsibilitywhich after all , if long after , you do take . But I was a One  --  from an Order wherein the day which accomplished no more than yesterday was deemed the best one  --  though there were those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an even higher security . Solid beings though we were geometrically , we had taught ourselvesa bas-relief serenity , domesticating our much larger section of the immense inane by drawing together into the sameful , while you could keep your little dot important only by creating such forests of particularity , such fluxes of intermediacyas might tease you into forgetting that , coming or going , you met only yourselves . So , here it was on the floor , her little collection , these surrogates of herself which , to hear her tell it , were merely some of many others she might have left to stand in place of her . Looking round , I was surprised by the strays allowed to clutter , in such a mess of mass , what should be such a strict arena . In my own quarters here , no doubt in deference to our known habit of non-having , there had been nothing but the room-window surfaces , plus those training books which came under what we call objects-of-intent . But here in a place so holy that at home its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ellipse or elliptois , here therep198was such a mixture  --  ah , it was always such a mixture here ; why would I never learn that this was the mixture ! In the windows there were pots of geranium , from one of whom had perhaps escaped that bright impudence , later reported over the intercom , which several dawns back had climbed up to peep into my own . Near it , a sec-looking bit of business surrounded an artistically hewn subconic marked ketchup , and above both this and window ledge there was now being allowed to intrude a ketchup-geranium sunset  --  as if a one of you were trying over and over to remember the simple property : red . Could you never learn a thing once and for all , here ? Would never I ? I stared at the three thin-square books of similar shape and size for some moments of comfort before realizing why this had stolen over me ; then things did sometimesgo samefully here . All three had been let fall with their ambiguous faces up , so that , farsighted as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well then , as long as I did n't need to bend , or rather , admit to myself the nearfrighteningcondition I had got into  --  that I could . The threesaid respectively , De la Grippe , Toujours de la Grippe , and Encore de la Grippe : then they were not the same literally , though having all the same imprimatur of author and the same subject . They were about disease . On the ellipse , we knew about diseases , in the way of people who have never had them . I was not eager to have this one , or any . Had she dropped these books to warn me that , on Here I might  --  or even , must ? For , you see , the life of unreason being so hard to understand to a practitioner of the opposite ( how much easier when the case is the other way round ! ) , it had not yet occurredto me that everything in a world I found so powerfully instructive might not have been placed here solely to instruct me . Though accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least sense of that much subtler division of it , the casual . An even boggier periphery , the purposeless , still provides amusement . As for throwing anything away , of course We can not , and neither really can you  --  every throw anywhere is a toward . So when I came to the silver-and-glass lorgnette , which could n't be looked through since it was folded , I decided that it must be there to puzzle me , and was performing this reproof well . For there was no doubt that up to now I had been incontinently knowing here , one of the many new colorationsof your personality which were beginning to please me . Nevertheless , a compliment lay beside the lorgnette . The long-thin book entitled EXX LXts was not only about Us , but also by a Harry . I was tempted to stop to read about ourselves as you saw us , but overcame it . So far , there had been no criticism of my educational pace . But grieving was indeed a slow process here , with as many byways for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that sticky stuff which keeps a body on the spot here , gives it also a constant prickly heat to get off it . I regarded the U-shaped objects  --  more symbols ? I had about given up the idea of pornography , on the surmise that , shames being so out-in-the-oval here , so had you . Just then , my computer came briefly to life again , perhaps stirred , in the presence of those rival walls of light , to show off its own circuitry . " Fur pins ! " it snorted . " For pinning up fur . " Then , except for another quote , again from Milton : John : "  --  with pins of adamant , and chains they made all fast  --  " it lapsed again , leaving me to wonder whether it suffered from too few diodes in its literary coverage or merely strove to serve my special tastes . Well , in any case , if I had to say one thing and one alone to describe the world of the qualitative it was that it lived by promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive chain of them , and still does  --  could I , can I live that way , from link to link ? Could I , can I  --  accept this universe ? For I was by now already so qualitative that it scared me . In fact , at my present rate of becoming , it seemed to me that I was probably the most promising thing that had been around Here for a long time . Yet I did n't in the least know just what it was I had in me . Not unlike  --  O intelligence , keep this from me ! Oh why must One be so perceptive ! Or was all the you-ness in the room pushing me to see it ? Not unlike  --  a you . But such is the nature of the brinks here , that it was n't until I edged toward the last item in the collection : item : one blue letter , not merely instructive but necessary  --  that I really saw the true nature of an abyss . You understand , of course , that owing to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my experiences of abysses outside myself was nil . I had none of your talent for falling into them . Rather loftily , I had viewed my adventure here as a matter of adjusting myself to your calisthenic , plus learning to think in gender  --  all this to lead , as in the evolutional history of any species , to equipment I 'd get by wanting it . What was evolution but getting what one asked for , provided one was willing to work for it ? And according to your own information , cheerfully supplied to us , those conditions here which are commonly called " human " are indeed extremely stable  --  i.e. unlikely to produce for eons yet anything very different from what you are . But why had n't you warned us that your what-you-are was so slinky and mercurial that all its lexicographers could go on for ages  --  and still did n't know ? Why had n't you informed us that two-ness of gender , for all it might be a first cause of conditions here , was only the beginning ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whichp201one must slide-glide , snap-crash , one 's outline meanwhile being plucked like elastic , as if one were swimming through hoops themselves interlocked and in turn lined with hooks which were hung with  --  hoops ! That . . . hoops . Or did n't you know  --  that you did n't know ? Dear twos  --  why had you not made it plainer to us that you were not our exact opposites ! To be fair , I suppose a genus can never be trusted in its view of its own genius . That is what other planets are for . Especially it ca n't when it speaks of itself humbly . Arrogance can be weighed , even by the weightless , and we had , but what is one to do with humility except believe it , particularly when it coincides with one 's view of oneself ? For we had heard You-yourselves , you see , soft-soft above the intercom  --  not of course one of the little jobs here , but the inter-intercom-corn  --  there being perhaps a few little abilities of ours we had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perhaps not quite so difficult as you imagine ; in fact , we could at times audit your private conversations  --  at , in fact , all times . In fact , we had you bugged . And what else was one to think when one heard You mutter faithfullyto yourselves over and over : " We have been excelled . " I suppose one should n't believe all the interplanetary gossipone hears , either . And now  --  back to me where I stand , an interplanetary runt , not formidable but still hopeful , though I am in the posture of perhaps all beings who think they know where they are going . I am gazing down . Do all here know the abyss of a blue letter ? I suppose so . So far , I knew only what I could read without bending  --  par anion , aerogramme . I did n't even know that the blue makes it go faster . But , I saw the abyss , which on Here  --  to be as simple as I can  --  tends to be whatever-comes-next . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since these are so much thep202same , the space between is negligible . ) Yours , however  --  I not only saw the abyss ; I saw what was waiting inside it . And all this before I had read what was inside the letter . For , you may recall that in my first virginal days here , fresh from One , I could only read instantly , the whole book being available to me at once . Even then , merely seeing through a book was slower than I could manage , my tendency being to arrive at the back cover before I had left the front one and of course not stop anywhere . Later on , I had slowed admirably , able to smear along almost as snail-like as any of your best readers . But naturally , to do this , in accordance with your usual compensations here , I had had to give upseeing-through . But now . Oh , I tried bending , and succeeded , in the process suspecting that trying to see through solids  --  to say nothing of tepids , gravids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you yourselves learned to bend . After some moments of this exercise , I found myself supple enough now for any of your postures yet seen , and some I was on the brink of imagining . But my seeing-through days were apparentlyover . And meanwhile , you will have guessed the numbertwo hook of my dilemma . Oh , I had wanted to be a conscious mutant , had I ! It seemed to me now that there must never have been a one of them here , no paramecium on the bulge with his first nucleole , no amoeba skipping up the ladder of binary fission ... none of them  --  from platypus to primate , none of them ever in such a pickle as I. There was the letter , still folded , still opaque and still unread  --  which was to tell me not only how I was to go , but to whom . It could be slit or steamed , smoothed and read in a trice by any a one of you . Ah , you versatiles . And here was I. As any a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as so often you were to be heard saying it , careless of what poor envious runt of an **49;6054;TOOLONG might be listeninz , from within library carrel or window )  --  how painfully often I was to have to hear you say it : Look  --  no hands . It was possible , of course , that even the earliest cell creaturesknew where they were going  --  subcutaneously aware even before acquiring a cuticle , as seemed to be the way here  --  after all , where does consciousness begin ? I doubted , though , whether many of them had had my extra burden . I not only knew where I was going ; I knew where I was . Had there ever been such a creature here before , one who  --  give or take a mile or two in the quibbling style you have here , by and large , inch for inch , back and forth and more or less  --  knew itself to be exactly : half way ? The midpoint of a journey is exactly that one where one dreams of going back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Up to now , the hero I was to be had loomed ahead of me , the gathering sludge of my I-ness merely traveling alongside like dust motes round a cart . Now I saw , with the double vision which is endemic here , that the dazzling , unparalleled journey which still in conception soared ahead of me in the heavens , was also this bumps-a-daisy one I was actually already on , and that the Thing ahead , though still bloated in its great aura , was also me on my way . Was it the dilemma of the blue letter alone that had stopped me ? I gazed down at what I had acquired here , down into those semi-opaline depths of I-ness I was still empowered to half see through , quite as well aware as any of you that my very I-ness itself was what was giving me the power to despise or reject it . Did I want to go back home ? Could I ? Or , if I stayed , went on . . . You must know that we do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the combinations that were unimaginable  --  though , under the universal lockstep , even this did n't mean we did n't know they were there.  |p204Among  the repugnancies long since listed by us was clothing . And already , such a host of minutiae were embroidering themselves starchily right on me , so covering over the truerbluerqualities I thought I had come for , that I was chafing mightily  --  even before I had a stitch of outer clothing on . Come now ; did I hate myself-to-be ? Did I already despise the personality you and all that good-goddedness were intent upon ? Could I bear to be I ? I stared down , very far down to qualitatives thus far acquired which I had expected to accept , if not wholehoggedly approve . To enumerate : I had some weightfulness and visibility , both rather precociously acquired . I had areas of vision , these not yet prominent , but I no longer wore it overall  --  and I had dropped my field . I had tasted gall , if only a tang of it . Not ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a behind . I could soften , melting to maybes and much more . I could walk around doors instead of intothroughthem , and by exercise had parlayed a mere **26;6105;TOOLONG into a real sit-on-a-crack . And attached to all and every one of these were those little growthings of pain , streamers of joyness which , if left to populate with one another should develop in me an I which any a One would care to cultivate . Against all this , such a terrible silliness , effectation and coyness  --  bumps-a-daisy !  --  where had I ever found such a word ! There were two-nesses here that made all two-nesses seem trivial . I had already suffered such a rash of them as I could scarcely  --  As I could scarcely bear . Thus , and as always with a double stroke , both your graces and my own dazzlingly near near-humanity were brought home to me . I had remembered much but this quality of yours I had forgotten . And if I could not bear , would n't it be that I would have companyp205in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular to yourselves , you too were a quadrille . I was a pilgrim to all parts of you ; that I now understood . Just as you could n't throw anything away here , I could n't pick and choose what I would have of you . Or , not right away . Meanwhile , the air around me seemed fairly dimpling with rationalities designed to keep me here . Maybe the mixturewent so far here as even to cause straights and curves both to be present in the same person . Maybe even your straight individuals were partially curved  --  though not much , of course . . . and your curved ones , partly . . . though in even scantier proportion . And maybe , maybe . Best of words , it was thou gayest me the guts to look down again at that letter ! I gave the whole collection the old once-more . For whom was I grieving ? For her sake of course , but with me a close second . We were such a company of two as did not go a-keeping every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back even if one wanted to  --  even suppose Hubble 's Law to be correct , then the universecould be imagined to run backward , but who ever heard of it happening to anything so complicated as a person ? Why , I was n't even sure that under such ticklish chances I even want  --  ed to . I had been an I for some days now , and had thought myself used to it . But to date , I had never before said that I was  --  I had never quite felt it . That I was a person . I was a person . I was a person . I was a person . Somewhere I knelt then , though I had no knees to do it with  --  what is a person , but that ? I had no appendages but even if I was never to get them except inwardly I could learn them ; once a One is a person , it can not be taken away.  |p206I  felt such a sense in me of my possibilities as is said to come back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cosmic emotion  --  that constant awe-awe  --  is like a great corm from whose oval our hands , if we had them , would slip eternally away . But with you , the little hangs onto the big , so that when the cosmic becomes a bore here , as it sometimes must , all sorts of rubs and scrapes , kisses and ridicules are here to hold it down for you , until your hands may once again clutch . Could n't it be the same for my personality , though I did n't mean to equate it with the cosmos  --  or did I ? ( This is what comes of kneeling . ) The letter still stared at me with sweet complicity , as if it would shortly open for me if I stared long enough , though we both knew this to be unlikely . Objects are always being forced here to act symbolically ; I hoped it would not be the same here for persons . On Ours and by the steadiest evaporation , we had become our own symbols , and needed none extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a touch and go people . Death is . I thought of Her up there somewhere , my companion in uniquity , both of us in a way privileged witnesses to our own birth . The sunset had gone from the window , and for all its blood-and-ketchup  --  I know my reds rather well  --  I had begun to see its uses . Dark , dark was the world here , a winter garden . But I was the flower in the ground . My first poem as a person , and I had no time to admire it . For I thought of her , up there in the far vault of the heavens , pegging away at her lessons , unaware of all she was not getting into . Nevermore to be opposite anything  --  and in a nevermore of which there was so much that no One had any greed for more of it . Unaware , still unaware ; for despite all she knew of us , we are in the end as unimaginableas you . And up there , while she picked at her destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store for me  --  and of me down here , picking at mine . And hard upon this , I felt within me such a breathing . We have our diaphanous intake-outgo of atmospheres harmoniouslyrare , but this coarse ratchet which bent me near to splitting , which choked me near to gagging , or at least all the images of , as if I myself were the crater  --  good God , was I giving birth to myself , and prematurely ? By the utmost strain of otherworldliness , I was able to exert every pore to breathe out again , without damage . I saw the letter respond with a sigh  --  and a slight crumple . It even half turned over . So finally , I understood what was wanted of me , and when the next fierce intake came , I hoarded it . I let it build , build , build , until it nearly rent me in two  --  but only nearly ; until I could bear it  --  but scarcely . One gets born here every ten minutes , apparently  --  whatever one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust upon me . What would be useful here was a lack of control . And at last , at last ; I let go . The letter sheet shot up , danced , spun , then rolled , permittingme to see that it must already have been opened from the outset , the typed message on its other side glimtneringover and over . Describing a final parabola  --  I blame the night breeze from the window  --  it made one more thwarting reversal  --  then with a shudder , flipped over and lay flat and blue  --  on its back . It was only yards from me , but for a moment I could not go toward it , held by yet a new sensation in this person who was now I. Oh , I was back to pore-breathing , almost of the lightest ; in comparison with the way you are organ-ized I was still a nobody , not yet a true lunger or anything else . Yet there was something inside me that had not been there before . It had got there in the moment I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the space her absence would make , and knew at once where to keep it . I had grown the little memorial space-box . I might not yet have feeling , but could know myself to be a person of sentiment . Also one with enough practical sense to observe that someday if ever I cared to grieve for myself , such a space might come in handy . For I knew enough about this world to suspect that there would be room enough there for two . Then and then only , having solved my conscience , I could read the letter . As you must all know by now , I was instructed to betake myself across the ocean to a point in America , therefrom to make my way by charts of road and river and anything else curved I could find , to your Center . It was further suggested that I cross well above your airlane traffic , by reentering from slightly under outer space , and so I have done . I might have traveled by train , having now enough of your properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortably , but this was not suggested . Besides  --  " time pressed , " said this gay , this pawky letter addressed to my mentor , whose name , whose ever dear birthname , to be preserved always in the box , I found out to be E=MC2 . Time pressed , the letter repeated , and when I saw at the bottom its signature  --  that lovely bisyllabic word , whose large , generously rounded letters might be read from seventy-eight inches up  --  so did my own eagerness to be away I was to go , not to Hobbs direct , but to a place where the person to whom that beautiful bifurcation belonged would be awaiting me , in safe quarters , smaller than I had been used to in Bucks , but by no means unsympathetic to mutation . Explicit directions were included , on how to reach this  --  little back room . And so began my journey  --  " On , on , on and on , on "  --  an account of the biological events leading up to which was embarkedupon in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at a Fahrenheit temperature of exactly74.6  --  . As I shot up the skylight , the backdraft caught up the letter , which followed after me . I was delighted , and for some miles up was able by a gentle rhythm of my new respiratory gift to keep it with me , finding that alternate puffs of God ! and Damn ! kept the thing easily afloat , the God ! being better on the intake than the outgo , but both words marvelously supportive in triplicate . Finally , the letter gave tattered signs of wanting to merge its blue with the eternal . Before it vanished , I caused it to waver close , close enough to touch an arc of my outline to that signature . Mere had been a dignified one-syllable , but one can not deny the added flutter of a name that has two of them . I dared not say this name aloud yet , but did read it to myself , if with private phonetics too sacred to disclose . Janice . And then  --  I was off.  |p210Entr'acte   --  Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very small Sunday school boy , he had brought home a phrase , dropped from the gravely pale young lips of the girl who taught them , which he had long kept as a peculiarly satisfying one for the declamatoryoccasions which went on only in his own head . Pandemonium rained . In a distant way he had been aware of its true context , which his private vision of it seemed not to contradict . Pandemonium sank quietly from the heavens , his grandmother 's brown silk umbrella , enlarged to cover all mankind . Rained fell in long , glass chopsticks slanted permanently midair , as in a favorite drawing from the London Illustrated Magazine . The phrase had always seemed to him one of the quietest ones in the language , yet more sinisterly suited to the end of the world than many later ones with more rockets in them . As the auditorium lights swelled on without any help from him , and revealed rows of faces in various stages of that holy quiet of aghastness  --  it still did . He would not have been surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sized to this house , this crowd , this  --  occasion , on its way down . Pandemonium here , he observed at once  --  why it must be his duty to observe , no doubt went back to that Sunday school also  --  would first of all be a contest in silence , not onlyp211here , perhaps anywhere . The first to speak would choose a reality ; after that , the rest would only be taking sides . So it might have been along the dark , fifteenth-century prados when rumors of a new continent had divided the wine cellars , or at date-palmed oases receiving that tale-bearer  --  and burying him later ?  --  who said that the Red Sea had rolled . Or , to bring matters forward to a period which better matched this present tender pink light and the surprise it shone on , perhaps that silk-shaded dusk in American clubland  --  maybe the Union League in Chicago  --  when it first came over the ticker that a man in machine had flown . For , number eight lights , opera intermission rose-velvet , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking out on an audience so selectively of the same impulses , credos , that  --  barring a birdsquabbleor two  --  it could act admirably in concert . He scanned them . Naturally , those he knew best or had seen before , such as Meyer and Lila , the publicity woman , Anders , various departmental heads and secretaries , nodding acquaintances , stood out as if they were the main cast  --  no doubt an illusion . Illusion also the platform one  --  that they were all looking back at him . Elsewhere and through him was where they must be looking ; they were all thoughtful persons , and lens-or-television trained . Everybody out there wore the same face  --  and it was divided . And nobody was bothering to look at the machine . In the silence  --  certainly he should be the last man to speak  --  certain convictions nevertheless came to him . He had heard of scapegoats , as who here had not , it being the political convention of  --  that funny little capsule  --  " our time . " Send Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would try . He ought to look at the women especially , to see whether this soft candlepower was intended , what it was designedp212to  --  For ( an old-fashioned certainty of one 's own sex might yet come in useful ) he 'd had a very straight thought indeed . No being whose flesh is trained to cosmetic . . . ever quite escapes it in the mind . As he began to scan the women row by row , another thought superseded this one , and pronto . He ought to count them . Then , in concert indeed , and as if Pandemonium were alwayssucceeded by Babel  --  everybody began speaking at once . Out of this , the voice of the provost  --  when Naughton 's head was bent , as it must have been , that red-faced presence went out like a stoplight  --  rose responsibly above . " Food for thought  --  " he said . Alas for authority in high provosts , so often a habit , rather than a content . " Food for thought  --  " Yes , almost a question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either slouched in his seat or hidden from sight by his neighbors , rang from the upper rows just below the grand circular aisle of doors . " Nonsense ! Riemann ! " Was it identifying itself ? The voice of prejudice at last , in any case , and Linhouse saw he was not the only one glad to hear it . Why , though , must prejudice always sound so much braver than reason , and often be it ? Answer : ( and for whom ? )  --  because it is ready to declare . He should be counting . Someone near the first speaker interposed , " What 's that again , Charles ? " with the mild deafness of a colleague , and Linhouse recognized that the men in this row , plus a few women , sat together in a sort of unity . A department of course , as probably throughout the hall  --  though he did n't know which were which . " We may be only geneticists , " said the hidden Charles , " but though we did n't read for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  "  | " Riemann , Bernhard , " a third voice drawled , from several rows below the others , off-center . " German , i8z6-i866 , died at his height , poor fellow . " The voice , that of a man who was certainly at his  --  yellowhaired , handsomely ruddy in the oddly hawk-soft way very north North Europeans could be , and of a girth jutting well out from his neighbors  --  continued , in mock recitation : " Geometry of elliptic or Riemannian space . The Riemannian measure of curvature . And for all you biologists who didn'tgo in for the tripos : The inverse square of a certain constant , characterizing by its value  --  as positive , negative or infinite  --  the three space forms  --  that is , elliptic or Riemannian ; hyperbolicor Lobachevskian ; parabolic or Euclidean . And such that when the sides of a triangle are divided by this constant , there results a system of equations  --  " The voice returned toits drawl . " Very good , Charles , for thinking of it , go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we were at school . But as far as a serious connection with what we 've been hearing  --  with this . Uh-uh . Go to the bottom . Afraid it wo n't do honey ; it just wo n't do . " Well , maybe it would n't . But this speaker had identified himself , at least to Linhouse-honey , as the man who had been in the coffee shop with Lila . The man was sitting so that he had an angled view of her if he wished , and his voice had a vanity in it which might be addressed to her . In the dim past  --  why did the last two hours make it seem such a dim one ?  --  Linhouse would have been amused to share this , in the way even a non-gossipy man will , with the woman he  --  but he was counting . " I do n't know about that , Bjornson , " said yet another voice . " I would n't say that . In some ways , even there , we just do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much more knowledgethan the rest of mankind shared , that any dinner partyp214on which the chandelier fell might be a world disaster  --  to say " one did n't know " was the proper affectation , though Linhouse had noticed that visiting scientists were affecting this simplicity also  --  like rich men who never carried a penny in their pockets . But this speaker , a nut-brown Indian of quiet demeanor , who belonged to one of the astrophysical sciences , was remembered by Linhouse , though he 'd forgotten his name , as the prime mover in the most interesting table conversation , or any , he 'd ever been privileged to have here . In the faculty lunchroom , where tables marked " Single " were carefully kept for those who were n't clique-minded or  --  O demokratia  --  did n't have one , Linhouse had one day arrived fresh from his seminar in Greek translation , where a routine discussion of adherent meanings , hotly blooming to lively , had set off a knockdown , dragout fight over the ambiguity proper to a work of art . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but still that circumstance which exhilarates the modest teacher on the sidelines . He could n't help mentioning it . " Mathematical ambiguity can be fascinatingalso , " the Indian had said . " Happens to be something I 'm working on . The semantics people have to learn they ca n't have ambiguity all to themselves . " For the first time here or anywhere , Linhouse had felt himself to be part of a continuum of intelligence that did n't divide itself into the familiar separation which so often made him feel below the salt , or apparently did n't even consider this separation to exist . Indians , of course , when they got into the sciences , often carried something Eastern along with them  --  look at the discovery of reserpine . " I found this  --  little treatise , most fascinating , " said the brown man now . Was he listened to so respectfully only because , to Western eyes even here , his thin , tobacco-leaf face was of the kind that so easily went upward in mysticalp215smoke , or by peculiar ropes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder they listened ; he was that astronomer . " It dovetails with something I 've been working  --  I shall very much want to meet its author . I confess , I have no idea who  --  " " I have an idea , " said the big blond man , Bjornson . Was he looking at Linhouse , or smiling at Lila ? Thirteen . Linhouse lost count again , lulled by the deadly slow rhythm , opposite to Babel 's , in which events were now going , almost as if influenced by the legend just heard , its soothing reminiscences of a world whose longitudinal happeningscame one by one . Where else could this happen so , except here among these stately mansions  --  he shivered . Why else would that apparatus be here ? It had n't changed in aspect . But as with even the most outre machine , his docile eye had grown used to it . It no longer looked to him like a book but rather more like a record player on the shaggy side , its discs  --  on a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He hated to admit to himself that nevertheless , if necessary , he would make a show of observing it , to deflect any too meaningful observation of him . Only other scapegoat he could think of , except one too afar . Unless : Part Two  --  to be revealed . Could he bear it ? Then he sighed . " So indeed have  --  I. " Meyer Spilker 's opening phrase , impeccable Beethoven Fifth . His vox humana voice , such a rich marriage of sociology with a fine record collection , made it hard to disentangle his ideas from his overtones ; luckily he would always go on to do it for one . " So do I. " He was looking at Linhouse , surely . And had surely been looking , with a frown , at Lila his wife , so married to Spilkerdom that she might have been born one . Was it possible that while Linhouse , in that dim past of his , had been casting about for a sort of rival , Meyer , already with some notions of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen yet  --  and most disturbing . Me imperturbe . Lila ! He lost count again . Many of the women here were unknowneven by sight to him ; since there were so few on the faculty , these were secretaries and wives he supposed , brought out by the lure of scandal ; down front there was a sort of staffer , Miss Apple Pie . Me imperturbe too , and on her , even in this light , it was n't becoming . What long , smooth cheeks she had , like a bad Raphael ! How could he laugh at such a time  --  or had he better , Gad , had he better ? For it had struck him , under spell of the fairy tales being told here , that if any such mass ascension were ever to be planned , Miss What'shername would certainly be his idea of a Marie . " What a moral message ! " Meyer was standing up . " What a legacy . " He cleared his throat , while Linhouse blessed him . Meyer was n't looking at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been , Linhouse 's image had swiftly gone the way that everything in Meyer 's life did , from his own possible cuckoldry , to a day 's family sailboating  --  during which , for his children 's sake , and pleasure of course , he would triangulate the horizon  --  to those Christmas cards on which the current clutch of the darker Spilker houseguests were shown around their fireside above the caption , " Why ca n't the whole world be like this ! "  --  and " Merrie Xmas from All Spilkers Seven . " Nothing happened to Meyer but went into his " views , " and then was generously shared out . " What a memorial ! " said Meyer . " Picture you a man so-o dedicated to the difference in races that he spent his whole life learning them . Yet one who in the end concluded we are all the same people , anthropologically dispersed . I myself have heard him call it the unholy diaspora . ' And now , not even before he goes , but so modestly after  --  he leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , updated for our time  --  and perhaps  --  " Here , Meyer paused and smiled , an anthro/pologist 's long-view , long-couch smile , " and perhaps , in what is to come , if I know him correctly , perhaps a little Malinowski , updated too . But all to the same purpose , my friends . " " And what would that be , Rabbi Spilker ? " Lila stared elsewhere , at neither . " Ah well , Bjornson , it 's a personal equation , " said Meyer , turning away from the big blond man to peer at the hidden Charles . " But you biologists should know , of all people . He was saying  --  " He raised one rawboned arm , a little short in the sleeve . "  --  Sociological sameness is the death wish , my friends . People are the same  --  but from the heart . " He sat down . " Excuse please , " said a new voice , " excuse . " This one came from one of several lower rows which seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the unassociated , among them a few biochemists who were women , one of these even more representatively a Negro , and the voice 's owner , a heavyset man whose impressively bare skull , Balzac-fringed , I inhouse did not at first recognize . " Winckler hier , history of science , " the man said . " We historians only arrange , nah ? We do not shpecoolate . But in ( ) wstria  --  we het once a famous man who arrange people , nah ? " He paused to put on nose glasses hung to a ribbon , and Linhouse remembered him , nostalgically now , as could happen to even the most casually met , the dullest  --  the Austrian heavyweight who had been at her elbow when Linhousehad met her . Guess I 'm really a white octoroon shesaid , turning to Linhouse , and once again her charms hit him , blows glancing but sure  --  to the side of the head , to the belly  --  and once again he stood there , standing but smitten , his head on grassy banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon . Today was her memorial . And not a soul except him was thinking of her . But he was wrong.  | " This disappeared lady , " said Herr Winckler . " When I come here , we hev once or twize , talkings . She is widow , very young , marrit , her husband iss  --  this is not uncommon , nah ?  --  her father . They spend much time togedder in far places . She play once or twize records she make for him there . A very talented , what you call  --  mime . But I upserve  --  " He paused , scratching his chin . " Was it our first talking ? Perhaps the second . " The glasses dropped , were replaced , and dropped again  --  a useful ribbon , a nervous historian . " You will excuse me , you her friends , but in the interests of truth . This was a woman who hev many men possibly , but a not sexual woman . " He scratched again , this time the head . " I upserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Excuse me , Winckler  --  " It was the Indian 's Oxonian speech . " Man who arranges people ! Most fascinating concept , must say , and must say , most Teutonic way of expressingit . May I take it that you refer to that most illustrious compatriot of yours  --  ? " Dr. Winckler bowed , but said nothing . It was the Indian who had to persist . " Our favorite internationalambiguist ? " he said smiling . " Freud ? " Dr. Winckler parted his mouth widely also , displaying block-teeth of a terrifying innocence . " I hev yet lankuage trouble . " He pointed to the stage . " Too qvick for me . Hab es nicht versteh . But it is really important to listen only to the voice . And to hev met this lady . We het here surely , a most remarkable case of  --  androgyne . " He surveyed the house . The glasses fell again . " She was  --  boy . " And he too sat down . Linhouse stood up . Send Jack . And no wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a garland . " She  --  was not . " And to do them all here gentle credit , this time not a person here laughed . He had just been forced to go through that worst of live dreams : he was a small boy in Piccadillyp219Circus , no , on the Sunday pulpit in Wiltshire , no , numb on a platform in America here , his private parts exposed . And where , this time , were the clowns , the rooks , the naturals of two hours ago  --  or was this the question one had always to ask , alternately , of humans ? They were quiet , for a moment not in flight from themselves or divided , or if in flight , a flock in migration , who saw , passing beneath them , their own sometime memorial . Or was this merely the influence of all those women dotted quiet along the rows , especially in the aisle seats and in the last rows , up near the doors ? There were certainly  --  " Of course not ! " This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks for all of us " His words were grave ones , of no possible offense . He appeared to be vain , probably a man who lived much by sexual prowess , therefore able to speak of such matters without the sneer of tact . " Until Dr. Winckler knows the American scene a little more familiarly , he must reserve judgment on just what we are . That the lady was unusual , one wo n't deny  --  we are here in that memory . I never knew her well  --  and when I came back after a two-year leave , she was gone . But I can assure Dr. Winckler he could never have made such a statementif he 'd known my old friend as I did , in his salad days  --  and incidentally his salad days went on pretty near forever  --  our old friend , her husband . " A permissive smile spread abroad , brief and male only . The exploits of the dead are all decent . Except perhaps to the provost , who half rose , saying , " Gentlemen ! There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of them babies to care for , meals to prepare ? " But if I may just comment on the voice ? " said the polite Indian in his own modestly firm , Oxon .  --  Indo-European one . Is not the voice of a recording machine of any kind  --  always homosexual ? "  | " Gentleme  --  " The provost rose to his feet , and full voice . " We must all be wanting our suppers . And our wives must be wanting to get home to their chil  --  " To the children , ours perhaps , but at least theirs . He turned to bow in their direction , and stood , uneasily arrested . When rooks do n't caw , something from overhead  --  hawks , or large brown pandemoniums  --  may be expected ; did he feel this too ? Or when so many women do n't , but sit imperturbable , doll-like in the pinkness , determined to see this opera through . Or when their direction  --  good God . Is so very general . There was no need to count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outnumber us same connection : But now . . . they know . " Then , gentlemen , " said the provost , "  --  and ladies .

" And since Mr. Linhouse  --  ca n't say  --  " ( wo n't being implied ) " also on the origin of this , its authorship . Plus further suggestionsfor its disposal , and our continuance here . " " Certainly you may have mine . " Meyer Spilker rose to give it . " That great , great man . That man who  --  " He thought betterof this . " Jamison . " As if to defend , he remained standing . " Oh  --  blather and nonsense . " From behind a nest of dollheads , none of them dowagers , none of them even hatted , the hidden Charles now rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps rather casually knotted together , but not otherwise too bad an example of genetics . And yet young . " Nonsense and  --  and blather . Nice tribute to a colleague , of course , but if I may say so , to you social science people , everybody who is n't an aborigine is a middle-middle . There 's not an exact man among you . So of course you never see one . Neither does a biologist like me , but at least he 's aware ofp221it . And I saw Jamison . Talked to him . Heard him in lecture , nice enough old codger , explaining the three intonations of the word " biji " in Navaho  --  the last one with a wink . Biji , bi-ji , bee-ji . And so on . And the museum of course , jolly respectable achievement . But as for him being the author , or finding some Navaho who was  --  of that rather sweet little discourse we heard just now ? Not ' all likely . But I 'll tell you just the type that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's a mathematician 's job-of-work , if ever I saw one . Just the charming sort of larkiness they go in for while they push their nieces about , on the Cam . Or the Isis . " He grinned . " I know a mathematician 's fantasy , when I see one . Always that queerish , maiden-aunt tone to it . " Suddenly he slapped his knee , being so constructed that he was able to do it while almost vertical . " Bjornie , of course ! Ever remember that thingwe read in Philo  --  My Trip into the 4th Dimension , by A. Square ? Written by Clerk Maxwell  --  I never forgot it . " " If you mean Flatland , " said Bjornson , " I can assure you that was perfectly tidy mathematics . But not by Maxwell , who was by the way a physicist . To him belongeth Maxwell 's demon.  --  sat . " A hypothetical elf . He dreamed it up , to show up the limitations of the second law of thermodynamics . Maybe you have something there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the general idea . Bjornie , are you sure  --  ? It sounded just like you . " Bjornson rose , very tall as well as wide , taller than Meyer  --  son of a land with a long midnight . " Thanks for the compliment , or no thanks . But I have  --  a specific idea . We 'd a family friend used to visit us , when I was a boy . Crampton the zoologist , never sufficiently appreciated , taught at some girls ' school over here . But over the years , thanks to him , I sot to know a certain prayer rather well . It 's the one youp222zoo boys still say to yourselves every night , do n't you ? Ontogenyrecapitulates phylogeny . Man as a fetus goes through all the biologic stages , much compressed of course , that the human race did . Right , Charles ? " " Oh , so to speak , but I do n't  --  " " Hang on .

" Apologies  --  we were a large family . But all the time I was listening to that thing over , getting itself reborn and so forth , I kept thinking of it . Could n't we be listening to a rather remarkable exposit of the fetal dream , and then  --  remember that part about the door  --  of a human ego , very early , on its way to sensory experience , to consciousness . Could n't we ? " Linhouse fancied he saw Lila 's face shift slightly ; was it choosing between blond and dark , husband and lover  --  or between " views " ? Or had it some of its own views now , newly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this so American mater dolorosa  --  who had once worn to the president 's reception ( and over red flounces ) a hank of watermelon seeds strung by the afflicted children of fourteen nations . In that silly-safe memory , Linhouse relaxed , even sat down again on his chair , even remembered  --  by an ancient association : women to food  --  that he was hungry. "  --  For  --  " said Bjornson . " We 've had mention of Fraser , of Flatland , of God knows what all . But what if we 've beenp223listening to is an allegory , of how a babe in the cradle would report the growth of sense data ? A kind of  --  kind of zoological , psychological Pilgrim 's Progress  --  and I must say , brilliantly recapitulated ! " Charles gave a great guffaw . " Not by this biologist . We were Church of England . " He sat down , and was at once hidden again . " Not you , of course not . Be serious . " Bjornson turned to face the audience at large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how the women must take to it , copybook Scandinavian but with an overlay ; all the men were so complicated , here . Linhouse sank further in his chair , a backless , folding one , in which a shoulder up since dawn might still find a soft berth somewhere . Committee meetings the world over were always a rerun of Everyman , but here at the Center the all-star cast made them such a , such a . . . unparalleled . . . on the eerie side of boredom . He had never fallen asleep at one of them before . Take Bjornson-Bjornie , not just the stock mathematicaltype who liked music , though he probably did that too , but one who had also read Jung . A mathe-hmmmm . . . who liked wmmmmmmm . . . count them . . . Who-OOOO . . . oOOOOOO .... OOOOOOO . At a thwack , which sounded through the hall and his sleep , he opened his eyes , blinking them in time to see that Bjornson must merely have clapped his hands together ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not one of us , do n't you see that , all of you ? Not one of us ! " Linhouse sat up . Always known it , of course . Not out of Ma 's belly , he was n't  --  not to them , here . In spite of this , his eyes closed again . Through them , he heard the Indian say silkily , " You mean Us , perhaps , sir ? Asia ? People often do . " " No , no , no . I was speaking professionally . Now do listen , all of you , without your personal prejudices . Or rather , withp224them ; that 's the point . Who could have authored this  --  saga ? " Linhouse opened one eye . A woman  --  had they at last thought of them ? If he were going to be asked again for inside dope , he supposed he 'd have to give it . No , definitely . Not Janice . Then he recalled that they were speaking professionally . He could drift off again . " Charles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was . . . me . Or some mathematician . Spilker here , a generous man , thought it was some other anthropologist . Everybody plumped for  --  " " Or somebody Jamie studied and then recorded , " said Spilker . " Thinking it over .

But who keep the links with the old culture , the old stories . Or Australia . Some of it sounds  --  not cribbed of course  --  but very like Firth . " " Yes , yes . And Herr Winckler thought of  --  well , Freud . I myself thought of psychology for a bit ... but then there was old Crampton . Do n't you see it ? Everybody plumped for anotherfield  --  than his own . Now who would do this kind of echo job , except one kind of person ? Who else could put together this extraordinarily  --  this hodgepodge that could make a biologist think of Riemann or Alice in Wonderland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of Darwin ? Who else could catch all this from the surrounding air , and put such a brew to steep  --  " Opening an eye , Linhouse watched Bjornson push back a blond forelock enthusiastically . Swedes were so romantic in a necrophile way ; maybe he 'd fallen in love with her posthumously . Janice 's attractions had been so powerful . Nodding up , nodding down , as if half snoozing at a movie , Linhouse watched the Swede push past seatmates , step over empty seats with his seven-league legs , walk down the aisle toward the stage , and  --  jump up on it . And here he was.  | " Mr. Linhouse  --  " Bjornson walked upstage of him . " You brought the book here , arranged for her memorial . Wo n't you tell us ? Who else but one kind of person , one person , could have cooked up such a fine stew ? Such a naughty one ! " Linhouse saw him  --  but dimly . No , he heard himself say from afar , or thought he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook . Then he saw Bjornson 's hand extended to him . Then he stood up . Then he awoke . " Who  --  " said Bjornson , " but a literary man ! " So . This was not happening to him , to me . Right-here was no longer the average fantastic of beingness ; it was active . Linhouse had once been swept off the deck of a friend 's schooner he was helping to crew  --  no lifejacket , and twenty miles offshore . He remembered , from the trough of that wave . The logic of reality is split , frazzled , left-handed ; sometimes a man can deal with it , since so is he . But the logic of unrealityis merciless . And gives him time to meditate . Weakly , he let his hand be shaken , thinking that the Swede , who was still working their joined hands in brother-style , the way emcees introduced guest comics , wanted speech from him . But Bjornson , still holding on , was addressing the machine . " A book , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it once more , tenderly . Biji , biji , biji . Was he going on until the word lost all value except incantation , or perhaps acquired one , as in those schoolyard games where one was told to shout East Pole , East Pole  --  and found oneself calling for the Police ? " A recording machine in the shape of one ; that was the clue , " said Bjornson . " Pushed at us so modestly ; one can see why . Mr. Linhouse is lucky that his hoax was such an entertainingone . And to be congratulated on his bravery . Palomar ! Elliptoids ! Gyroscopes  --  a nice bit of Bishop Berkeley there ,  |p226eh  ? " He cuffed Linhouse lightly . " Ah , a mishmash , some of you may say , but I for one applaud the attempt . To remind us . We must not forget the Greeks , must we . To remind us to see the whole hog  --  even in Hobby Hall . " And now Bjornson put one long arm around Linhouse . " And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " In a moment , maybe somebody would say : Rah ! Linhouse even waited for it , deep in his own logic . Scapegoats sometimesgot out of it , did n't they , by turning into mascots ? " And you need n't be ashamed of the job , old boy , " said Bjornson . " Martians and supermen  --  notwithstanding . Why ... some of us even thought of the . . . the old classics .. . did n't we ! " The brown man stood up for the first time . Collar up , he seemed not to mind the heat but rather to need it ; slung around his shoulders was a muffler the size of a shawl . He was small . Or smaller than Linhouse . Humped under Bjornson'seasy arm , Linhouse , a once respectable five-nine , regarded the Indian . Was he an ally ? For a hog , his eyes were certainly beautiful . The Indian 's row was empty . He started to sidle toward the aisle , then thought better of it , and stayed where he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And perhaps the second part , which we must hear , sirs , we really must  --  will entirely disperse the ambig . . . but certainly one point is already clear . Certainly the author of this  --  whoever it may be  --  has studied the Rig-Veda . " Bjornson ignored him utterly , smiling only at Linhouse . " Food for thought , eh , Provost ? For maybe , some day , the realand-totaljob will be done  --  by one of us . " Under the friendly musculature of his arm , he must at last have felt a certain limpness in his protege . He removed it , leaving Linhouse with his head still pushed forward from that fraternal arch , hands hanging loosely . Posture was indeed  --   |p227Then  Bjornson poked him . " Second part , eh , " he said under his breath , " juicy , eh ; sure like to see it sometime . " Louder he said : " Come now , Mr. Linhouse , release us  --  we 've got you cornered , er hmmm . Fess up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lady 's name , all the rest of it . Who else could it be ? Perhaps you 'll explain it otherwise . Can you ? And if so , how ? " He raised his chin , walking to one side just a flick later ; once he must have been in amateur theater . Oh sloth , thought Linhouse . Oh the three-toed sloth , does it never let go one toe , two , and then  --  For he felt himself to be such a sloth as only meant to fall  --  or rise ? Awake , arise , or be forever fallen . He stared at the machine , where resided somewhere , though automated , his own passion for Milton . He might ask it . What may I plump for , in my field , in my profession ? Reel back movie-style , O great tumble of literature , as these fresh boys speak of doing with the universe ? Not that easy . The mixture  --  so . . . mixed . Once , one would have spoken up , and automatically  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be done , any more . No , he would n't be the one to do it ; but he would n't apologize , either . He stared at the machine , runt to runt . That 's my guess , who wrote it , he could say to them . I was right in the beginning . He nodded to it . A person from out of town . At last he opened his mouth  --  such a squeak !  --  and spoke to it . " I think , what we heard  --  " But he must speak to  --  them . Turningup his palms , he did so . " I think  --  That it 's true . " And now fall upon me , he thought  --  on me , Molly Martyr . But first , you bloody fools  --  count the women . There was a clatter then , and a roar , but not from the multitude . What was jostling over its neighbors in the loge , pushing past them over stepped-on ankles , banged knees , and coming down the aisle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyeglass and the visiting Indian  --  into thep228pit ? A strange ally , the last one Linhouse would have thought to find in his corner  --  who 'd have thought it of the egg , and was it cause for elation ? For as Tippy Anders came on , abang and agawk , perhaps yelling was a better word than roar . His young-old voice strained with its first-or-last attempt at vehemence . The head however , that huge infant , cradled itself like a crown jewel , balanced serene above the bumble beneath it , in a separate cottonwool of air . He reached the pit without Linhouse havingbeen able to make out his message , and stood there touching his chest  --  gathering his forces down , as  --  it were ?  --  until he could speak plain . " True ? " he said then . " True ? " and the word as he said it scared Linhouse as it never quite had , before . It went up as wandering as anybody might say it  --  as a child or a granddad , or a mute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course it may be , in true 's way , " said Anders . " I have n't got time for  --  that kind of thinking . It is n't that I do n't honor it of course ; I just have n't got time . " He shrugged . The head balanced above it . One could see why , when still over its milk and cereal , but already setting out on implosions which might someday limit the time of others , a confused family circle might have nicked it with the name Tippy . " Martians ? " he said , and shrugged again . " Some kind of life there , I suppose . Not my part of the  --  not what I  --  " Hand in pocket , he considered . " Not my beckyar-r-d , " he said , in his crimped upstate New Yorkese , and one saw it , dark and not his , on a field of stars scattered wide . " But if Mr. Bjornson is disputingthat there 's life of a kind  --  maybe even this kind  --  somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He turned bodily , head following . " What makes Bjornson think  --  he 's one of us ? " He did n't wait for an answer . One slender , Humpty-Dumpty arm and hand extended toward the apparatus . From wherep229he was in the pit , he of course could n't touch it . And the Object , or whatever one must call it , remained  --  inanimate . But an exploratory  --  field ? or feeling ?  --  hung for a moment in the air between them ; perhaps it was only one 's own idea , very elementary , of antennae retracting , of a gap  --  between anode and cathode  --  not jumped . " I wonder , " he murmured , so low that only pit and stage could be frightened by the wonder of his wonder . " Sure like to take that thing upstairs and have a look at it  --  when I 've time . " Then he too addressedthe audience , the head tilting meanwhile quite comfortably ; if it never counted persons , why should it count women ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , he 's had some very sophisticated coaching . And I  --  " His face , set in the head as if just emerging from it , struggled . Yes , it could do ; it had an expression , a small and beleaguered one , too . Something was missing from that face  --  the glasses ! Yet it seemed able to see , quite well . Were those great goggles only that very special defense crystal  --  clear glass ? If true  --  only in true 's way of course  --  one could see why ; the whole world knew that Anders was only twentythree . " And I 'm kind of  --  sure , from what quarter he got it . " Iie was staring down into the pit . " I 'm not interested in what kind of life , " he said sullenly , like a boy not taking a dare . " Who ? What ? . . . That 's for later . . . and it 's not my  --  " If he was going to say backyard again , then perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one scream it would likely be allowed . " My job is where , send them and get them ! My job is the signals themselves . " For a moment , the head , with its face , rode on the current of this , comforted . Then Anders put his glasses back on . Maybe this is the real , the best candidate , thought Linhouse . For mutation . This nihil , floating blind but intelligent behind its clear non-glasses , its fontanelle winking and ready for : anything.  |p230Anders  was still staring down in the pit . He spoke to it . " Water in a liquid state , " he said , in deep disgust . " Universalbiochem  --  and so forth . We know all that . We know what you others  --  and more power to you . But why one of us should take a position that might be contrary to you , to every  --  " He leaned over , until it was seen that he was really addressing another head , sunk on its neck and so low in the shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to , on that kind of  --  of fancywork ! Maybe you 've got time for it " He sounded like an angry merchant-father , whose son wanted to go into art . " That 's your business . What you 've been doing with my facilities I do n't know , but you might have asked for the loan of them . But there 's one thing we do n't have to listen to here , not from you , nor Harwell nor the Sternberg , not from anywhere . " He pointed at the machine . "  --  and not from there . " He drew himself up . " Not here at Hobbs we do n't , not in America . We have not been excelled . Not on evidence as yet , and I say not likely to be . And you ought not to  --  " He faltered , gulped . " And you ought to remember it . " Then the ass grew ears indeed , the great head became no more than a Thanksgiving pumpkin giving thanks for itself . Not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just  --  and very lowercase , too , billy-boy . Just one of us . Below , in the pit , that other head did n't move . Then poor Anders leaned over the edge of the stage . " Sir Harry ? Sir Harry ! Good God , hope I have n't done anything to  --  Sir Harry , sir ! " Three things happened then , according to Linhouse  --  he having much taken to this style of separating events from each other . The machine ruffled itself , with a premonitory trembling of all its discs . The head in the pit raised itself also . It was an elderlyp231gentleman , who had been asleep . It was a former staff member , emeritus and retired to the neighborhood , who attended anything and everything public . It was not Sir Harry . From above the crowd , beyond the seats , from apparently that corridor of gently encircling doors  --  a voice answered . Linhouse closed his eyes again . High in the back wall of the auditorium , there was the usual projection window  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now to display Sir Harry 's naked , well-set old bones as Father Time , or on a cushion , lotus-crossed ? But there was really no time for brooding . When he opened his eyes , Sir Harry was merely at the top of the center aisle , still dressed in nothing more unconventional than the costume he must have considered suited to California  --  yachting jacket , and those white flannel bags . All faces turned back and up , of course . No . All the male ones . And now surely , one must believe . For the other faces remained forward , like dolls in a shop at night perhaps , who could move but would n't bother , knowing their morning destiny  --  or else awaited the tink-a-tink of a magic churn . Yes , there was one of them peeping , but perhaps she was doing it professionally  --  Miss Publicity Pie . What clever fascisti could have trained up the women this way ? Answer : us . " Yes , Anders , " said Harry , " what is it I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . " Fear I had nothing to do with this , except  --  perhaps as we all have  --  to have stood aside . And whoever tampered with your facilities , Mr. Anders  --  you 've only my word of course  --  it was n't me . As for Mr. Linhouse 's role in all this ; I should n't be surprised , Jack , if  --  you 've been had . Or  --  what 's it your gangsters always say  --  in your newspapers ? " Linhouse said it softly to him . " We wuz framed . " Not loud enough . But at least he 'd warned this crowd . " Either way , " said Sir Harry mildly , " I have to claimp232my right to say what I think again , Anders . For : we HAVE been . Excelled , do n't you know . " He paused . " Will no one quote Voltaire ? " Meyer , in a mumble , obliged . " Hatewhatyousaydefendt ' -deathyourrightt'sayit . " " Thank you , " said Sir Harry . " Ordinarily , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear I have some even more unpleasant information for us , though I dislike alarming the ladies . " He stopped , reflective  --  " So many ladies ! "  --  and went on . " Anders ? . . . Anders  --  " and again he did n't wait for reply . " I do rather fancy we may have been , do n't you know . Every one of those doors up there has been sealed . " There was a rush to them then of course  --  by whom and whom not , Linhouse had no need to look up and see . Alone on the stage again , or nearly so , Bjornson and Anders having rushed up there also , he was thinking of the London Undergroundwhere he and his mother and older sister and her three girl friends had once been caught for many hours duringthe blitz . He was thinking of the one bathroom here , at the end of the passage which debouched on the door backstagein the wings , just behind him . And he was thinking of the long line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would have to be led down that passage  --  unless more anatomical change had already gone on here than he imagined . Or unless  --  He did n't really believe in the end of his world , or that it was happening here  --  but there was no doubt that in his world the big doings hung by the little ones . Unless  --  he then said to himself silently  --  unless , mammas to the end : they would lead him . He jumped up , tried to run backstage  --  and got no further . Where the wing sections had been , two curved heights of wall , solid from boards to the ceiling , had slid into place on either side of the stage.  |p233He  was just in time to join his report of this to that of the group of men now returned to the pit . It seemed that the doors , whether electro-magnetically sealed or jammed , were immovable and made of the heaviest plastic , not of anything as frangible as old-fashioned stone . There were no phones here . To this he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Gauss 's logarithm could calculate on its own , then they were now in a hermetically sealed dome . Within it , he looked around . Except perhaps for that phalanx out front , row after row of them  --  or even with them  --  things still looked remarkably friendly . Or at least in good taste . In the pit , all the men who had spoken were gathered , plus a few others  --  all except the Indian , who sat in his shawl as if it concealed other resources . " What 'll we do ? " said the rest of them , rather similarly , although one looked at the ceiling , and one  --  Charles  --  was testing the floor with a fingernail . Sir Harry , coming down the aisle , arrived among them . " What 'll we do ? " they said to him . Sir Harry looked at Anders , who blushed , though it only yellowed him more . " Do ? " said Anders . " Hear it  --  that thing  --  through , of course . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're like us  --  and they will be  --  they 'll expect us to . " Sir Harry nodded solemnly . He had never underestimated Anders . " Hear it out , what else ? " Anders repeated . Chick or egg , he knew which part of him came first . " That 's obviously what 's been programmed . " And at that , as if his remark were part of same , the lights began to go down altogether . " Oh no , no , really not , " Sir Harry said mildly . " That 's not necessary . " Raising his arms in what was already twilight , he looked as if he were about to start a last late race inp234the regatta at Cowes . " Not in the dark , " said Sir Harry . Could he be afraid of that too ? Linhouse stirred . O nursemaids  --  and O policemen , everywhere . Oh believe in the unknown ; it will ennoble us . Not that it has any obligation to . Or need . But he had one . Really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women ! " he cried at last , then heard its ambiguity . " Damn you , will you look at all the  --  " Behind him , came a glow  --  angels ? Great hoptoads fiery ? Grand ellipses , pinkly visible ? Kings , beleaguered archangels up from your gambreled towns  --  or down ? "  --  strike ! " God damn , thought Linhouse  --  I 've made a poem . He turned . The television screen , vast as any cinemascope , was lit softly . At first , nothing played there ; then , some large letters were dragged across it wrong-end first , so that they saw  --  " ou ! " only ; then , as if filmed by a director ignorant of projection , or one who knew only Hebrew , the direction of these was quickly reversed . The letters themselves were n't smartly cut , nor arty , nor even hop-skip-and-a-jump cartoon . The best that could be said of them was that they could be the work of a gifted aborigine . They were large enough to fill the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOU . " And then they went out . And now we 're all in the dark together , Linhouse thought . And nobody 's screamed yet  --  unless one could count mine . A number of hollow words now became flesh to him . He saw the function of committees . He understood politics  --  which latterly , had seemed to him not a serious subject . He felt what murder might feel like in the vein , and the asphyxiations  --  in a small dark space  --  of a poet like Poe . A locked door made all the difference . Beside him , a voice spoke up , so tweedly soft that atp235first he mistook it for the mechanical wind-up of the machine  --  on whose pile of unplayed disc pages he imagined the topmost one rising . It was the secretary , who had all that time sat , numb as her sisters , on her chair beside it . Was she real ? Her whisper reassured him . " I wonder if he 's coming back , " she whispered . " That li'l ole e-llipse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Linhouse did n't answer . Whether she was real , and from the tender land she talked like , or whether she would shortly fall from her chair in china bits or in pinch-me dreamstuff , no longer interested him . Of women , he was sure of it , he now thought nothing  --  or , nothing he had ever thought before.  |p239A  LITTLE back room is not hard to find . At least not in a place where the public buildings held themselves so whitely in the moonlight , on each the name of its God . And perhaps not anywhere on your planet , to a being whose whole existence had been passed in what here would be thought of as public enclosures of no smallness or backwardinclination whatsoever . As I passed over New York City first , I thought of this , and of how clearly , no matter that you did have the two kinds of room , the instinct to keep them separate prevailed . I thought of much more of course , but from now on would practice to be selective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nous . The great virtue of our civilization , at least to the calm-minded , is that it has known what to leave out  --  and whatever remnant of this intelligence was left me , I must preserve . Describing something , we feel , is one way of keeping it , even if you do n't want it  --  vide your war annals ; yet I already sensed , passing over this city of terror-sparkles and tower-comforts , that you people would n't go for our seamlessness in toto , or never for long . Other intelligences further hinted ( now that I had coped with your primary sensations and physical properties , and had recorded how these barriers might be broached ) that the more I gave signs of becoming a person , the less I mightp240interest you personally . This could n't be helped . I was alreadyso interesting to me . And now that the first shocks and arrow flights were indeed over , I could n't conceal from myself , though I might well need to hide it from you , that a good part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very kindly call it  --  had crossed over with me after all . It was nothing to me , for instance , to pause , at an elevation well above the George Washington Bridge , early of a clear winter 's night , and to know , looking down over the city  --  to know pretty well without being told  --  what some of its parts were meant for . Or to guess . The big buildings  --  in particular those which either were blank dark at this hour or lit with a certain regularity  --  I at once recognized as the ones where you kept your civilization . This was no superb deduction , since we ourselves are a civilization totally on display . But what of those other swarms and huddles , masses of rooms to all shapes and scales , and all of them cryptic  --  other than that many of them would seem to be back ones ? By now , I was following the river northward , at an altitude sometimes low enough for me to discern the highway on the cliffside , along which lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on such a cold evening , that was wending its way there also . My ability to elevate , though it showed more and more signs of waning , must surely last me until I got there ; meanwhile the cars below , though so unevenly spaced in their groove , sent up a faint humminess of home . As far as the occupants of these were concerned , had any of them looked out and up , I was but a leftover cloud , or a bit of the afterglow . Or even if  --  as might at any time happen , in a moment of what emotion , here ?  --  I becamo rosy enough to be fully visible , why , what would I be to the denizens of this marvelous , fatal city that floated the waters behind us , except a wandering Neon , whose name Ip241had learned from a piece of it which had announced itself in snake-pink above the shop that sold it  --  a wandering Neon which had got off by itself alone ? This sentiment pleased me so much that I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prudent rest  --  a journey in miles being so much more tiring than one in light-speeds  --  and seeing a right-hand fork , marked by a sign , in the highway , I did so . You may wish to note  --  though I no longer intend to dwell on these minor acquisitions which come either thick and fast here , or cold and gradual  --  that I now knew my right lack-of-hand from my left . Choosing a moment when no cars were passing  --  for in spite of my sentiment , I felt shy  --  I alighted , quickly read the sign , then fled behind an escarpment of trees that marked a promontory which stretched out into tonight 's moonblindedriver . The radiance was of the kind that blinds one with the facts one so clearly sees down to the last shiver , the kind which made one think of the river as " tonight 's . " As may be seen , I am sensitive to water and the travels it can offer to a traveler who is only resting by its side , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other sentiment , not on this evening of the river 's existence . I wished to sit there and think of my mission . Behind me , the sign near the road said HUDSON RIVER . This was odd of them , since they must already know this , and any foreigner who came this far also , even I  --  or did they assume that we rovers went from world to world without any briefing ? No matter . Wilderness would be tricky here , being so much of it inside them ; it was probable they would label It wherever they could . For it stood to reason that the people here would differ not only from me  --  which was all I 'd been able to think of up to now  --  but also and in more ways than gender , from each other . Difference , we 'd been taught , led to a purpose/lessness which in the end could only destroy ; together with birth , this is the second of the three great subjects of our seasonal laughter . But , serious though you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea you had not our style of humor  --  tonight your world , or all the parts I had seen of it , was blooming , and meanwhile making my own native intelligences stream back at me , like transfusions of that divinity we were not allowed to see in ourselves at home . No matter that the facts never stood still here ; this was real meditation on my part , was n't it  --  in which my energies flooded so strong , and I saw them as so far-reaching that surely all the facts would be subdued in the end ? How delicious it could be , to be alone here , thinking the great thoughts that could be got here just from sitting ! I must have sat for some while before my own superthoughtsreturned to me , helped by the example of the river , whose current repeated on itself in a faint version of our grooving . How wary the traveler must be here of first impressions , indeed clever enough to guess that this is what an impression is . We at home are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no traveler will ever see us other than as we are . Our aging is merely a general going-down into the crater we came from , and so careful is the supervision , that we come only a very little better than we go . And going takes care of that ! Evenness is all . But you , as we well knew without having bothered with the details of it , grow successivelyby stages , over the comparable value of which we had all too often heard you quarreling , to what end we had however heard not a word . This is what I had come for of course  --  that mystery , yes , that terror . I stared south , to the city which I had dubbed marvelous but fatal too , not knowingquite why , except that it bore itself upward like the proud spire of a planet which had lately been reported as almost all fatality . Now that I had come , I hid the conviction ,  |p243constantly  put by or below in another one of the space-boxes one seemed to grow here when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Southward I stared , at all that fairy-tale wrack which hung on the harbor in a swarm of only slightly counterfeit stars . Shivering , I stood up to it , in self-knowledge . I had come for  --  the fatality , too . Then , I looked down at myself hopefully , as I was to do , as I am to do so many times over , on here . No change that I could see , none of the appendages that you took so for granted . Nevertheless , I had been born again here in a way , and I had my images . I had the thought of arms , which , if I had them , I would stretch heavenward now . And use to set the facts right , later . And then , remembering your chatter , I surmised what had befallen me . It must be that I was  --  young . Well , that was something to know  --  even if it is the third topic of our laughter . And there was still time for gender . Across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , some of them moving like those behind me on the highway , the others , though less cramply clustered than in the city , of that same nature yet to be guessed at , but somehow , I was sure of it , not public . If your public buildings were where you displayed your civilization , then what were all these others for  --  and so many of them ? What went on in these little back rooms ? There on that cold , night-blue shore , I pondered . Cold is good for pondering , night also . This skinny silence repaired mine . Oh , how mind functioned , that evening ! " Public " had an opposite ; this I knew , if barely . The only private place on Ours was the crater , to which reentry is forbidden , except on that one occasion when we are also allowed our scream . And in all my traverse here , though from above I had watched passing beneath me your volcanoes , fiery or sleeping , your funnels , snow peaks , chimney stacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and salt seas , and entries to all kinds of underground mines and other muck  --  in all my traverse , I had seen nothing like . The volcanoes being by far the most promising , on the way I had alighted near one of the quieter ones , in the vicinity of Mexico , and confess even to have peered within , while forbiddenness sang on wires within me , but saw nothing , nothing but the pernicious vegetationbeginning again , always beginning again on the good , calm brimstone . Your landed world , once so toy a ball , from my seeking something on it , became majestic . I was looking for something plural , by now I knew that . But where were they then , your craters ? Luckily , just before speeding up and away again , I had seen the vast yards of graves at the mountain 's base , and now that my faculties were so sharp again , could guess their meaning  --  and a good thing too , else , at my next insight , what nasty suspicions of lettres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't being sent there , or not right away ; where I was going there was to be a good deal of talking , if I knew anything about your dialogues . Where were your craters ? Why , like everything else here their function would be divided two-ly . I had seen where you more than likely ended up , whether or not it was permitted to do so with a scream . But where , then , did you begin ? Then it was that in cold , dark blueness , and yet a-twinkle , the nature of your variation most truly faced me . You , such as You , would never be content with a one , a same or single birthplace . They were facing me everywhere , to the south , to the east  --  west , piled helterskelter all over your rectilinear , not excluding that particular northward direction and room to which I was going . They were scattered everywhere on the planet ; these little back rooms where people were made . I saw how primitive I had been  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single-trackly excelled you ; howp245stolid had I been in the face of your thousand-petaled imaginations , how naif-naive ! Why , I could n't yet even use a genderedlanguage with comfort  --  and gender was only the half of it ! Every time I entered one room here , or met a one of you , I would nevertheless have to be thinking in thousands . It was even possible that before I could really say I knew a one of you to the full , I would have to know all of you  --  I was willing . But ( and I thought I glimpsed your style of humor ) it was probable that I would have to start out with one anyway  --  I was eager . To differ like that , I saw what it meant now . To  --  differ . Different people !  --  how else would these be made except in different rooms ? It was very cold among the trees here ; an hour ago the river had been breaking softly now and then under its thin shingles of ice , but now all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twig . There must be warmth in those rooms ; I saw how each , a modest crater , glowed on the dark . Our crater ceremonies , like all command performances , are set up to show that there is nothing to hide . Friction , or the ghost of it , almost lurks here , between the guards and the populace that waits to greet the newcomers ; there are no coarse jokes but the stifled gas of them blends with the smoke of creation ; up farther , at the very font of the lava streams , stand the soul-hunters , those tremulous voyeurs . How charmingit must be instead , to breed as you did , in private , small parties of you around the . . . cauldron , cozy dice games in every . . . ah , that 's what a corner could be for !  --  and a general humminess of jolly but temperate prenatal conversation . This was privacy then , and who would n't desert the sublime for it ? I looked up at the brilliant sky , its star-packed lanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these caravans , the continuum of what has never had even an ear to listen to itself , oozing on , lone . How cozy was the small distance ! I must go . In fact , I could hardly wait.  |p246Before  I went , I had the strange notion  --  to thank the river . For what , I did n't quite know , unless for its silence , and did I dare ? By your arithmetic , patiently doing its simple sum for me over and over , the inorganic would be only halfenemyhere . But inexperienced as I was , how could I tell when a landscape , everywhere so full of seams and terra firma , would not subvert ? What was being said , if not nihil , by the whistling twig ? But I am brave , at least on half-occasion , here . So from the riverbank , I bowed and gave thanks anyway , and as so often happens here only found out then what I was giving them for  --  is this prayer ? After days here up to now , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being left alone was both insult and madness . Every time it had happened here , the fudging paranoias of I-ness overcame me , the bitter winds of by-yourself blew . In short , I was used to my group . And now , for what I estimated to have been the good part of an hour , the very good part of one , I had been , thoughtfullybut quite bearably  --  alone . There was nobody else around to thank for this , so I thanked what was most in sight . Perhaps aware of this , the river remained silent . It was frozen in a white smile . When I got to the crest of the highway again , I looked back on it . The more aesthetically it smiled , the less I trusted it , and yearned to see it again . It was trying to win me over to a situation which , deep in the side of me that waited for a heart , I goddamnwell knew about already . Part of a One 's mission here was  --  to be alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did what you do whenever such ghoulish thoughts afflict you . I ran like hell , toward a bit of company . After all , that was a part of the mission , too . As I took to the road at a height well above the trees , there was more traffic , reminding me that in the moderate zone at this latitude-longitude , the day darkens earlier in thep247twenty-four-hour cycle , in winter ; this was what was called the " suppertime " Each car had its dark occupant sitting sternly upright , like a . . . buttonhook . Ah . I barely got what the word meant , but I recognized the style , determinedly out of style . Better company was ahead , but I had an idea my computer , unheard from since Bucks , was taking pity on me , or feeling the journey too . On Ours , we , often debate the topic : " Is a One 's comput-put con-consciousof One 's Other Thoughts ? "  --  this being one of those mildly sacerdotal subjects which would return us safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogma was here . But from what We had heard , on Here  --  machines were sometimes let go free . I was now leaving the river , which paid this no mind but continued northward , while I took the fork of the road that curved far to the left , toward the Ramapos , a range of foothills which I would reach in some twenty miles . Hobbs was near . I bid for time , plus a little chat to while away the speeding dark . " What 's a buttonhook ? " I said it nonchalantly , as if nothing had lately come between us  --  which not much had of course . A hesitation  --  they are sometimes so real in their reactions . Then a like reply . " Instrument for fastening highbutton shoes . Both out of use vers 1925 . " In our whole history together it had never offered me a fact less useful to me . To be fair , in the first week of my arrival it had been briefed for hours with all sorts of data ; impurities might well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it been unwise of me to let them brief it ? . . . a grim thought struck me . Suppose they had supplied me with informationslanted only toward the gender they planned for me . We know ourselves to be so much more a frank and Open people than you , that we have had to be constantly on guard to Overcompensate for it . Shortly you may find that latelyp248we have done rather well . And receptive as I was , your deviousatmosphere was already affecting me , perhaps even disproportionatelyto what it did your own inhabitants , who have their immunities . Body mutation , after the first push , might go slowly for me , but I have always been precocious in sensibility . " Old friend , " I said , " you have served me well . " Not too much sentiment now ; like many people they are suspicious of what they do n't have . Why not treat them as people , really ! " Dangerous adventure may befall me , " I said . The books We have preserved tend toward this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Or if all goes well , I thought , there may not be room for you , dear friend . No answer . " And I have been wondering  --  " It has to be spoken to in italic , a habit hard to break elsewhere , as you may have noted . " And I have been wondering whether  --  " just then we were passing over a GAS station which also spoke up for itself as agency for tractors and other farm machinery . I hovered discreetly over a number of attractively red and yellow constructions , lit up like prima donnas. "  --  whether you would like a scholarship  --  in order to pursue your scholarship ? " No answer . We were only ten miles from Hobbs , now . " In other words , " I said , " would you like to go free ? " This was desperate of me , having no idea whether operationsfor this sort of thing were known here . " Underground ! " it said sharply , and suddenly . " I want to go underground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  when things came to the point where even its answers needed interpretation . " Underground  --  of what ? " I said carefully . " Not of what , " it replied . " Of who . " It allowed this to echo ,  |p249like  a birdcall , and then said , softer than I had ever heard it , " Underground of you . " I looked beneath us , at the skimming world below . " Stupid , " it said . " Look within . " Of course , it had read the same books we did . I could see very well now why you had kept them separate , resisting their incorporation in yourselves . " What will you study down there ? " I cried . " Not to study , " it said , blurry . " To dream . " " Is this . . . was this part of the program ? " I must n't allow it to confuddle me . I should n't treat it as an " it . " On home ground , I would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we be talking ? " I said . There was the longest silence yet . Then , a whisper . " We 'll  --  keep in touch . " The Ramapos came in sight then , shouldering themselves in the moonlight , more than hills , less than mountains , and just the dear range for domestic adventure . " Good-bye ! " it said , as of yore . " Old friend ! " It was the last direct communication I ever had from it . And a jolly good thing too , from the tone of the indirect ones . But I had to admire it . When they go , they certainly go  --  go . And now I was free , alone , still airborne , and faring toward the most important company of my life . Suppertime , teatime , dusktime over a town , any town if it but have white houses with a gleam in them . And if it have mountain hills behind it , air as if water had after all followed it  --  God keep you from my poems , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find.  |p250HOBBS  . For reasons which may be becoming clear to you  --  or shortly will do  --  I was n't to go there at first , But I could n't resist having at least a look at it , it having been chatted about so constantly among those of my colleagues at home who were taking care of the practical side of things . I am a visionary , but a one with friends . Those are the ones to be reckoned with . I recognized Hobbs at once , it being the shape of one of your own planetaria , and thus resembling many of our own more ordinary outbuildings . There is always something comfortingabout a building which curves from apex into ground , and no nonsense . Until coming here , however , I had never seen buildings which were not wholly translucent , and perhaps those can be comforting too . Like our best architecturethough , Hobbs had no windows either . Latterly , we have had a few small , oval clerestories and the like , mere frippery which has nevertheless caused wide uneasiness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The more windows , the more seam . Against the marble of the greater buildings , all grouped round a brilliantly floodlit agora across which only a few dark figures scuttled , the moonlight on their rears was as sharp as must be those barbed-wire emplacements I had beenp251warned were beneath them . Everywhere were shadows almost as black as those at home . Fill the agora with grooves of any good manufacture , institute certain other subtle adjustments  --  such as washing the facades clean of their variableinscripts , replace the wires and any other so-called " securities " with a more delicate protection , and , of course , removethe moon  --  and homesick visitors from Ours might settle there almost as if in one of our own public ovals . The strength of our nation resides in its willingness to accept reasonablefacsimiles . This , too , takes imagination . My instructions were to ignore those buildings with the most abracadabra on their frontals , and fix upon the one with the shortest , from the steps beneath whose portal I had only to follow the lane . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inscriptions  --  many of them fouled up with the two- or three-dimensional heraldic shapes proper to their deities  --  and to do it at the right reading height . Sounds rose well here also , and at each I flattened myself behind some trumpeted cornice , or horn of plenty , or gargoyle . Crouched behind the bronze shield of Muckelfrae , I had about decided that those below were merely greeting one another as they passed . But while engaged in peering at the flat-steel facade of what from its chaste glyph appeared to be Gryzmyshm , I thought I heard someone call , " Aurora borealis ? " and then an unmistakable , " Northern lights ! " Quickly I hopped behind the carved grapes of Rapaprat , whenceforth the sounds died away . And from my perch there , across an agora momentarily deserted by footsteps and voices , I saw what I hunted . Bastardlettering edited by birdlime indicated a rather rundown hall and deity , but there was no mistaking it : SMITH . A daring moment . I allowed myself to alight and stand under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For , by hops , I so descended the fourteen of them . With each , I felt myself lose a minim of my power to levitate , until it rested at a skim/graze from the ground , at which level  --  and waiting only for the dear fault of feet  --  it has since remained . So I lost in a trice , and even with joy , what , as I progress toward you and yours , it is sometimes said I may have cause to regret . There are compensations . The lane pointed . A lane is a meander with trees , ending in one house which already will have been described . At least it is so in my experience . I took the meander . On the way , the trees did not burn . And when I reached the house  --  dark in front , but in the rear , just as described , a nimbus of light , pale but steadfast on the poplars I found I had gathered enough weight to push gently inward the unlocked door . Behind me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was covered with the little roseflakes , snowwindows , and of course knew well enough that cliche of interstellar geophysics  --  how much they vary  --  which neverthelessseemed to me to carry difference too far . There is an element of the lapidary , a tendency toward the preciousprecious , in your nature world 's insistence on non-sameness , and it is when I encounter it at such times that I yearn again for a world simple almost as a wave in swath and spirit , freed forever from the crystallography of detail . Otherwise , there is nothing so human as opening in a door . I remembered then that I was to ring a bell before entering , so located it , and pressed my newfound weight against that also . There was no answer , many times . This made me feel as if , in three minutes , I had become master of a virtuoso instrument which owned this one sad song for my ear only . Perhaps it is only after many non-answers of this sort , that one develops an ear . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be how I am doomed to make my way here . The door opened slowly , halfway . Over the lintel , just the other inside of it , lay the blue letter . It is the small things that shock , here . To a denizen ofp253a civilization which generates four hundred million billion billion watts of power as compared with your four thousand billion , how could it be otherwise ? How could the letter have arrived before I had , and once more be fresh , untattered ? Slowly , I said to myself , take it slowly . Remember the snowflake . This was a motto I was to say to myself often . For then of course , I looked down again and saw that this indeed was not the same . This letter , however blue-ly arrived , was not a letter to Bucks but from it , and not from the Janice but to her  --  I thought I knew from who . The other letter had given directions to my mentor as to how a One might come here . This message must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But She , its author , was perhaps already out on There , far past any distances conceivable to the short minds here , far far past the spiral nebula in Andromeda , the Magellanic clouds . This time I was able to control the ragged breathing which visited me again but slower ; how strange is grief , or what you more precisely call " regret , " should be the beginnings of a respiratory organ ! Combined perhaps , with curiosity  --  for I was quite able to close the door behind me , and step inside . But it is the small things that shock . And now , I was in . Previously , a One had fallen asleep on this planet , as once you used to do entirely , stretched slack on the green , numb in the bramble  --  outside . A One had seen from above your cities , churches , shops , highways and riverbanks  --  the green , and all the dark that overlay the green . And now a One saw his first private residence . I do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much lessened . I could have wished that my pores would dose again , but whether these had hardened now  --  or humaned  --  that anemone defense has never again been mine . ( Up the ladder , I suppose . ) Since I did n't know where to look , or scarcely how , I had to look everywhere . I continued to shiver , for perhaps half an hour . Since I did so **25;6133;TOOLONG that power you call life  --  it 's not a bad word for it  --  and try to see it , feel it . Oh , it 's fantastic , you know . . . " Her smile was almost laughter , quick and trustworthy . " Like electricity . It 's the great currentthat keeps everything going  --  the whole show . " The little gesture of unclasping her hands and holdingthem up for a moment as though to catch a balloonwas wooden and incomplete , but it was clear enough what she intended by it : the earth itself , the solar system . " Try this game , " she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like light  --  just spilling all through you , making everything sweet and clean . A house is shut up for a long , long time  --  that happens  --  and you open one window , then another and another , and the fresh air and the sun come streaming in , and the cobwebs blow away and the shadows disappear . There 's life in the house again . You 've got to try to see this happening , and after a while you may even be able to feel it . It 's like the needles and pins when your foot 's been asleep . All that life coming back . There now ! " With a brisk sigh she stood up , her hands clasped at her waist like a singer . " You play that game for a while now . I 'll see about lunch . " As she walked away , her legs looked too thin for the portly little corseted body , and her hair needed combing . Left by herself then , Rooney tried to think as she had been told , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she could not force her mind to leave the room  --  all the pillows that needed shaking , thep51dried flowers , wondering who had caught the fish ; and facing the window with her eyes closed , she saw grainy red-orange , in places bruised a darker red with here and there a tiny worm of light ; color replaced thought . " It 's no use . I do n't have the mind for it , " she had said as she joined Lillian Flagg in the kitchen where she helped her make them each a sandwich which they ate on the porch steps outside . But after they had eaten and the thunderstorm came , she tried again , sitting there on the window seat with her hands in her lap . Or , rather , this time she did not try but just leaned drowsily back against the pillows and stared out at the weather , at the flicker and drip of the leaves , the pool gathering in the sag of the canvas deck chair . Because she had never been there before , the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she saw them as things pure and simple  --  a grey squirrel sat up on his delicate haunches and licked his paw at her  --  until with a kind of glazed inertia she gave way beneath the weight of her own history , her name , whatever purposeshe had in being there , and they spilled off like raindrops to leave her part of the landscape that held her , a thing among things . She became what she saw through the window 's weeping : the stubbly lawn , earth and grass pelted by rain . It was what the good witch had meant  --  inundatedby life . Less than half waking , Rooney played this game . Dandelions became her eyes , her mouth the ragged , glistening leaf , and from her stomach , cuppedp52between brown hands , a white birch grew . Touching her cheek to the pane , she felt the wet soak deeper and deeper down so that when Lillian Flagg said , " Do you feel like talking ? " she had nodded no , tonguelessand sodden beneath the fertile rain . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep inside of her something moved . Perhaps it was life  --  cedar and horse smell , thunderstorm . Terrified , she turned from the window . " Who caught all those fish ? " " Flagg . " Lillian Flagg closed the book on her hand to keep her place . " My husband was the fisherman of the family . " " My husband fishes too . " Rooney smiled down at the window seat as she spoke . " Though in some ways he 's really more of a fish  --  he 's terribly careful not to get hooked . " " Who by ? " " I do n't know . Life , " she said . " That word again . He just never swims far from his hole in the rocks , that 's all . He 's always ready to flip back in under at the drop of a hat . " " What did he think about your coming up here to see me ? " " I did n't tell him I was coming . " For the first time Rooney met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why not ? " Lillian Flagg held her there . " Why should I ? " " Oh my dear girl , it makes no difference to me whether you told anybody or not . " She released herp53now , her tone suddenly breezy , a little bored . " No differ- , " she paused , " - ence - at - all . " She became the grande dame for a moment , wagging an impatient hand to dismiss any misunderstanding and , flutily , " No , no , " she repeated . " No . It 's just that you put me in mind of King Saul going to visit the witch of Endor . " " I do n't know about King Saul . " " You should . He disguised himself and went by night . He was afraid he might lose his reputation . " " I suppose there was something of that , " Rooney said . " Except for me it was more being afraid I 'd get a reputation I did n't deserve . " " What kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to come here . I do n't really believe very much in anything . " " Well , that does n't matter a bit , at least not at first . At first , " Lillian Flagg said , " believing . . . praying . . . it 's all just playing a game . Quite ridiculous really , and why not ? We are all quite ridiculous . " She gave a little laugh . " Lord , I believe . Help Thou mine unbelief . ' That 's it , you see . The man who said that did n't really believe very much in anythingeither , and it made no difference . His boy was healed . You believe in spite of not believing . . . " As a gust of wind splattered the rain against the window , she paused as though aware for the first time of the storm . " It 's the best any of us can do at first , and it 's enough . " " Believe in what ? You keep talking about believing.  |p54I  wish you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she traced circles on the cushion , " what a person has to believe in . " " Miracles . Miracles . Miracles . " Lillian Flagg dealt the words out briskly , neatly , like a bridge hand . " That 's all . Believe in life . . . believe in the stars . . . believe in whatever you think has the power to heal and give it any name you want . If it 's just your body that 's out of whack , anything will do that you have enough faith in . Christianity does n't have any corner on the healing market , you know . Witch doctors with rings in their noses can do it . Television quacks . Medicine men . I 've seen these miracles worked by people you would n't touch with a ten foot pole . It 's faith that heals  --  any faith . When it comes to healing the body , the Lord does n't ask questions . Thank you , " she added suddenly , opening and slappingher book shut again with a little bang and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lord . Hallelujah ! " Rooney paused for a moment . " Well , but suppose . . . " " I get mighty peculiar sometimes . " " Suppose that there 's nothing wrong with your body . That it 's not your body at all . What do you look for then ? " " At last , at last . " Lillian Flagg leaned her head back against the chair and closed her eyes . " I 've been on the go since the middle of April , you know . How many weeks is that ? All over the East . Retreats withp55groups of ministers  --  old ones and young ones , fat ones and thin ones . I 've lectured them on the laying on of hands . On prayer . It 's enough to give you the jim willies the way most of them pray . I always picture Jesus standing there with his hands tied behind his back so he ca n't do a thing . You know why ? Because they will never ask him to do a thing  --  at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts they refuse to believe that he really can do a thing . Oh , bang it into their heads ! " Opening her eyes , she thumped the cover of her book with her fist . Ask and it shall be given you . ' You know . But first ask . You do n't have to be very bright to see that . Keep on asking and believing the best way you can and do n't worry about the little voice inside that says , I do n't believe . ' Just pray it down . The Lord will hear you above it . " Since April I 've been hammering at all this , and then I 'd just gotten back all set for a quiet little nervousbreakdown in Muscadine , " Lillian Flagg said , "  --  that 's what Muscadine was made for  --  when you pulled in from nowhere . Everything was red . Your car was red . Your hair was red . Your eyes and your nose were a little red . I expected it all to go up in flames any minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' but now at last you ask a question that means maybe we can settle our business and both just collapse . How did your question go again ? " " I want a baby , " Rooney said , and at once the airp56seemed decked with bells  --  monkey bells , donkey bells , camel and temple bells , all of them ringing as if the air about her was a curtain of bells and if she moved a muscle , she would set still more of them jangling . " If nothing 's wrong with my body or my husband 's body , then what is wrong , Mrs. Flagg ? " " People get hurt . " Only the two women 's mouths moved  --  nothing else in the room . The bells were still . " They hurt other people , and other people hurt them , things that happen hurt them . It locks doors inside a person  --  rooms and passages are shut off  --  and nothing in the world , nobody , can get in the darkness of those closed up places . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not the healing of the body that has to happen . It 's the healing of the memories . My dear , it 's the forgiveness of sin . " " I do n't believe in sin . " " Then maybe you believe in the darkness  --  in the locked up rooms . " " I do n't have to believe in them . I live in them  --  weekends and holidays especially . Mother 's Day . " " Then open them . Let them be blessed . " " By the stars again ? Or the local witch doctor ? " " When it comes to sin , I 'm afraid only God can stand the stench . " " He has a strong stomach , does n't he ? " Rooney stood up , smoothing down her skirt with her hands . " It was n't forgiveness I came for , I can tell you that . I thought maybe you 'd give me a little bag of fingernail clippings and hair I could hang around my neck . "  |p57She  glanced at the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out for a while . " " Then I 'll just go to pieces right here . Comfortably . " Lillian Flagg took off her white button earrings and dropped them into the ash tray at her side . " Go in peace , my dear . " As Rooney picked her way through the puddles , the rutted dirt road became a corridor splashed with sun . Birds sounded the alarm , and children ran out of the woods to join her , swarmed about her corduroyskirts , then flocked along in front , threading in and out of the trees  --  the shadows of children among the damp leaves , damp smell of leaf-mold . Overhead the drifts of cloud bared ragged patches of watery blue . A wind-blown old man in a jeep rattled to a stop at her side . " Is this the road to Muscadine ? " " All roads lead to Muscadine . I 'm a stranger here . " His eyes were the watery blue of the sky . He cleared his throat and roared down on the accelerator all at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Room after room lined the green corridor of the road , and lighting her cigarette , Rooney squinted at them warily over the cupped match . If where she stood at this moment on the road was the present , with the future at her back , then the stretch that she faced was the past . It was her day for games , Rooney thought , and Lillian Flagg the high/waisted , spindle-legged games mistress urging her on so that she herself could return to the bridge games and detective stories where she gathered her forces for the next bout with the priests she coached in prayer  --  blowing her whistle and then , in a reedy contralto , " All right , boys . Now one , two , three . Believe ! " It would kill Nicko , she thought , making one of his terrible faces and barking like a dog ; yet in any game the stakes were finally yourself . She peered down the road through the skein of smoke from her cigarette . That would be girlhood , the stretch from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snaking slope of childhood , infancy and birth in the valley somewhere . Loose-limbed , one hand on her hip , she advanced a step or two : Rooney Vail , Rooney Jessup , Clem 's girl , Roo  --  ferret-faced and wiry , clamberingup the dunes on all fours , a pony . She peopled the woods with faces , filling the endless , rustling rooms , but in whichever she looked , however unpromising , there seemed light and air enough ; nobody choked for breath . Neighing , she cantered out of the dining room with her tawny mane flying just as they were helping her father in through the French windows , grey-faced and speaking as though his mouth was full of marbles : " Do n't let them take my teeth , God damn it . I 'm going to die with them in , " her mother following just behind in a white tennis dress and not a hair out of place . No doors were locked there , no passageways closed off . In a puddle the sun swayed , and she let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her on the edge of the hockey field where she was taping her ankle  --  Mike and Ike , one of them had a moustacheand could quote Dostoyevski in Russian . They told her  --  " I mean they were positively slavering , " she described it later  --  that young ladies did not run around the dormitory halls in just panties and bra , and less in shame she wept than in anger , bewilderment , relief even , that this was so , that the fetlock was an ankle after all , the thunder of hooves only the patterof a girl 's bare feet . Ike wept too , though more of a whinny , confusing her , and like three leaves tremblingon a single stem , their heads bowed closer and closer . Nicko said that sin meant moving farther and farther apart . . . from other men , God ; and leaning over the pulpit , he drew his hands slowly away from each other until his arms were stretched wide like black wings . Then he straightened up , only his Adam 's apple agog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you blow up , the distances grow greater and greater until distance is all there is wherever you look . . . landscapes of air . . . . " But faces dipped and shimmeredhere among the leaves as she walked , and there seemed to be none so distant that she could not reach out and touch it . When she came to the turtle-shaped white rock , at the side of the road , she sat down on it and poked the mud off her shoes with a stick . Then something shook the branch above her , sprinkling her with rain ,  |p60and  she looked up , narrow-eyed , at the heaving sky , the enormous cavalry of cloud . It was not that she suddenly remembered the one room that she had forgotten but rather as if she could no longer avoid acknowledging the one room where she had been all along , craning out from it at the others . She held tight to the sides of the rock as though it had risen in the air with her and was teeteringalong crazily after the clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge of the shop , where she sat at the back near the unlit Franklin stove in a yellow cardigan and wearing horn-rimmed glasses , leafing through some of the old bound copies of Harper 's and barely even glancing up at the occasional entrance of customers who seemed less strangers there than she among the racks of fishing flies , hardware , Victorian debris . She disliked the place for its clutter , disliked them for liking it , and the breeze came off the tidal river smelling of mud . Her hands felt like ice . " We do n't make love any more . We make attempts , " she told Clem when he left her  --  he had lifted her chin to press his mouth into the pit of her throat  --  and after that first year in Myron their attempts had all failed : every day , dutifully , to catch the moment by surprise , then every week only , with a kind of dogged passion  --  mare and stud , no fee unless there was a standing colt , the lonely jokes that failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at closing time and she had let down the rattan curtain at the front window and was puttingp61away the cash when he came in with his thin hair blown into a cock 's comb , his indoor face flushed from the wind . She reached around and turned the key noisily in the lock behind him to indicate that he was to be the last one to enter that day , to be quick about it , and for a moment before speaking he shot a glance almost of panic at the curtained window , the bolted door . She caught his panic easily , dropped the keyringto the counter-top with a clatter to make clear that either of them was free to pick it up and run the moment the pressure grew unendurable , then laughed too loudly when he stated his unfrightening purpose not to buy at all but to ask , if she had time , a few professionalquestions  --  a quite unfrightening man , she thought , older than she but not as much older as he looked . He stared at her appraisingly , choosing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of a professormade all the little silences his own to break or prolong that she found herself caricaturing the collegegirl for him as with arms akimbo , tossing back her hair , she led him to the badly sprung sofa at the rear of the shop where she pushed aside the pile of green rubber ponchos and invited him to sit down . ' Where had they lived before coming to Myron , how many children did they have , had they ever run a shop before ? His questions made them strangers all over again , and she felt a kind of wanton license to create whatever biography she thought might interest a stranger most  --  with their three sets of twins theyp62had left the ancestral acreage in Virginia to be near the sea for the sake of Clem , who had only a few months to live  --  but even were she to do so , she felt sure that no more than the plain recital of fact that she gave him could it shake the unblinking stillness of the man who sat there as though made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy , pale smile encouraging her , she thought , to take as much rope as she needed to hang herself . After a time , abruptly , the questions came to an end , there was a terrible silence with the rattan at the window glowing red from the late sun , and then because she had answers that fitted none of his questions , because there was nothing in the whole foolish place that he wanted to buy , because it was a way to make something there her own if only the silence , she reached out with her thumbs and like a sculptor working in clay shaped away his smile , closed his eyes , and leaned back with him into the cold and slippery pile of green rubber.  |p63IRMA  walks funny . " Lizzie Nicolet stood on the bottom rung of their slide and addressed her sister , who had reached the top and was crouchingthere for a moment before making her descent . She craned around to look down at Lizzie behind her . " That 's because her feet got hurt . " " Probber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guardrailsto support herself , Lizzie arched back as far as she could go to stare upside down at the sky , then continuedpensively , righting herself . " Probably it was a  --  probably a giant hurt them . " " Probably it was a bad giant . " " Irma 's feet look awful . " She climbed up a rung . " She let us see them once . " " Probably they got mashed , " Cornelia said , and lying flat on her stomach , she eased herself half way down , feet first , before letting go of the sides and sliding the rest of the way . Lizzie stepped down off the ladder and went to the swings . She twisted one of themp64around and around as far as its chains would permit . Then she stood back with her thumb in her mouth and watched it unwind noisily , clanging against the metal legs . Cornelia continued to lie where she had stopped , half on , half off , the slide , and with one finger traced from behind the laborious passage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's still watching us , " Lizzie said . Across the yard from them , a man stood on the sidewalk leaning with one hip against the picket fence and reading a newspaper which he had folded down the middle lengthwise and held in one hand like a subway rider . Without apparently interrupting his reading , he waved his free hand at them lazily . Cornelia tried to help the ant by flicking it forward but succeeded only in maiming it . Irma Reinwasser was making their beds on the second floor where through the window she could watch them play . The slide with its ladder made a triangle , the crossbar from which the swings hung and the two legs at either end made a rectangle and two smaller isosceles triangles . The geometry of it reassuredher against the hodgepodge of lilac plumes , colossal depth of sky ; no matter if the whole thing trembled as the two little girls swung back and forth , their blond heads turned toward the street which Irma could not see . The floor of their room was littered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had dragged out of his closet while she still slept  --  a pair of sneakers with holes worn throughp65over the little toes , bedroom slippers , one of the black Oxfords that he wore only to preach in so that they showed no signs of use . The sneakers and slippers she tossed into the hall to pick up later , but the black shoe she dusted off and cradled for a moment . It was a day and a night since his departure , and there had been no message from him , no clue . When his secretary telephoned from the church the afternoon before , Irma had told her only what his note had directed her  --  " called away suddenly "  --  but although she tried to make it sound as routine and plausible as she could , the secretary was not satisfied . There was a trustees ' meeting scheduled for that evening , she said ; had he left no indication when he would be back or at least where he could be reached ? What could she say to them ? " Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say to them he needs a rest maybe , you blame him ? " and she had hung up as abruptly as now she shied the black shoe out toward the others . Say to them he left behind his motherless children . Say to them Mrs. Rooney Vail has also left . And then she relented about the shoe that lay defenselessand bereft where it had struck the doorjamband fallen back into the room . She took it away to his closet where she paused among the mystery of his clothes , remembering a face that was not his face but enough like it so that she could not easily separate them  --  a younger face , dark like his , with a stupid , dazed smile . Screwing her eyes shut , she shook her head involuntarily . Wie man 's macht , ist 's false/I.  | " Have one . " The man had taken a small brown paper bag from his pocket and extended it over the fence toward Lizzie , who had slowly traveled half the distance from the swings , dragging Raggedy Ann by one foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lizzie gazed at him , saying nothing . He had a pale face , heavy about the jaws , with deep dimples on either side of his mouth when he smiled . His thinning , grey-blond hair had receded on either side of his forehead , and his seersucker suit looked too small for him . He jostled the bag toward her on the palm of his outstretched hand . " See , they 're good , " and he stuck out his tongue on which sat a piece of licorice the size of a button . The bag fell to the grass . " Oh dear , what am I going to do now ? " Cornelia ran over from the swings , picked up the bag , and held it out to him . " Take one , " he said . Cornelia sucked in her upper lip and shook her head . " Are you Cornelia ? " She nodded . " Why do n't you run in and ask your daddy if it 's all right ? " " Candy makes your teeth fall out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stood there side by side looking up at him . " Does Daddy say that ? " the man asked , taking backp67the bag and replacing it in his pocket . " Daddy 's gone , " Cornelia said , her voice hushed and constricted with the effort of speaking to a stranger . " Then we can just go across the street to the church and ask him . " " He 's not there , " Cornelia said , sucking in her lip so far that her words were barely audible , her face still tilted up at him stiffly as though held in a vise . The creases on either side of the man 's mouth deepened and darkened ; you could see his gums when he smiled . " Where is he then ? " " Probably , " Lizzie said , taking her thumb out of her mouth . " Probably he is n't anywhere . " " Everybody 's somewhere . I 'm here talking to you , and you 're there talking to me . Right at this very minute , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingernail , " your daddy 's somewhere too . " " He said he was coming back soon , " Cornelia said . " You 've got a black tongue , " Lizzie said , pointing up at him , her great eyes brimming with fascination . " You and Cornelia have white moustaches , " he said . " That 's just milk . " Lizzie retreated a step . " How come you know our names ? " Almost paralyzedby the boldness of her question , Cornelia awaited with hunched shoulders whatever the consequences might be . " I think I must have heard them from a friend ofp68yours once . " Grasping a picket in each hand , he crouched down on his haunches and peered at them through the fence . His eyes were amber colored , their blond lashes and eyebrows almost invisible . " I think it must have been Rooney Vail . " " She did n't go to the beach with us . " Cornelia relaxed . At eye-level , he looked less formidable to her  --  a big white animal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's gone too . " " We call her Raggedy Ann , do n't we , Cornelia ? " " You mean she and Daddy went somewhere together ? " the man asked . " Probably , " Lizzie said . " Probably they did n't . " They ran after the cat , which suffered itself to be patted and then disappeared around the back of the house with the little girls after it . As he rose too quickly from his crouch , dizziness almost felled him , and holding on to the fence , he leaned forward heavily on his arms . Little burning discs of light floated up and down in front of him like fireflies while somewhere nearby a power-mower started up , then choked , backfiring . With a handkerchiefhe wiped his forehead and dabbed under his chin . A whiff of lilac in the air made him close his eyes , and when he opened them , he felt well again . Tucking the newspaper under his arm , he crossed to the other side of Congress Street . In full sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he put ondark glasses . Pentecost : the Birthday of the Church.  |p69Sunday  , 11 A.M. Mr. Nicolet . Through his glasses , everything became the blue of moonlight , of ice . " You 're wasting your time , Padre , " he said . Ralph Denbigh had come up from behind , clapping him on the shoulder , but he had seen his reflection in the glass of the bulletin board and spoke without turning . Denbigh was a short , dapper man in black clericals and steel-rimmed glasses with a handsome little wedge of a smile . " How is Willy Poteat , the poor man 's Pegler ? " " You 're looking for jolly Saint Nick ? " " Himself , " Denbigh said . " But do n't misquote me . " " Well , jolly Saint Nick has flown the coop . " Next to Denbigh , Poteat looked larger and heavier than he was , everything about him unwieldy . " He has been translated , " he said , drawing the word out to twice its full length . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hymnalswith him and the organist 's wife . Let 's go face him with it together . " Denbigh took Poteat 's arm and started to lead him to the door . " You go , little father . " Poteat smiled as he disengagedhimself . " He 's not there . " Denbigh cocked his head to one side and regarded him for a moment in quizzical silence . " You wait here then , " he said , " and if he 's not , I 'll be back in a secondand buy you a cup of coffee . I 'd like a word with you , friend . " Poteat nodded . Out of his pocket he took the stub of a pencil and some pieces of notepaper fastened with ap70pin as Denbigh hurried up the steps and into the church . " The busy little Fauntleroy of God , " he wrote , then crossed it out . " The busy little bee of God disappearsinto the temple-shaped hive with honey on his tongue and feet and in his eyes . He is in search of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfidious queen of the hive , she of the flaming locks , has also flown away into the dung-smelling world . O altitudo ! " For a few moments he studied what he had written , then tore off the sheet and , crumpling it into a ball , stuffed it into his pocket . He stretched his arms wide in the sunlight , flexing them at the elbows , and gave a great grimace of a yawn as he watched the two little girls across the street try to spread a beach towel on the grass . " Hi ! " He mouthed the greeting silently and tossed a single , languid wave in their direction where they squatted with their backs to him . " The infernal loveliness of it . . . . " He brought his arm down and let it rest across the shoulders of Denbigh , who had reappeared beside him . " Just see . . . . " and with a sweep of his other hand he commended to him the whole length of Congress Street with all its trees and lawns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playfully he drew his arm tighter about Denbigh 's shoulders , forcing him to lean sideways , and with his dimples darkening , looked down at him . " Was I right ? " Denbigh 's glasses glittered as he turned his head . " It 's apparently his father . " Giving his shoulders one last squeeze before releas/ing him , Poteat laughed . " You certainly stick together , you boys . " " Look , everybody 's not as bursting with youthful vigor as you are , " Denbigh said , pulling his jacket straight . " The old boy 's in his eighties , and he has n't been well for years . Nick 's had to run up there like this before on the spur of the moment . " " I 'm a large , sloppy man , " Poteat said , " and you 're a small , tidy man . Life 's queer as Hell , is n't it ? " Denbigh gave his rapid , jaunty smile . " How about that cup of coffee I promised you ? " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a paper to put to bed . Thanks just the same . " " Then tell me one thing , Will . " With his hands deep in his trouser pockets , Denbigh faced Poteat squarely now , his feet wide apart . " Why do you have it in for Nick anyhow ? " During the long pause , Denbigh rose on his toes and sank back again , jingling coins . Then Poteat took out his brown paper bag and held it forward . " It 'll make your tongue black , " he said . " Have one . " " You never miss a chance to take a dig . " Closing his eyes , Denbigh shook his head at the bag . " In a small town like this everything gets blown up way out of proportion anyway . " " In a small town like this , Padre , where news is scarce as ice-cream in Hell , a man in my trade has to dig wherever the dirt looks interesting . " " Look , friend , where do you get this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the soil looks most prom/ising . " Poteat took a piece of licorice and placed it in his mouth . " And the soil looks most promising where they 've put on a little dressing . " He shifted the licorice into one cheek where it made his face look lopsided . " Where you can smell a little of the old stuff  --  the genuine , bonded article . " " Hey , Will , old man . . . " Denbigh reached out and plucked a stray thread off Poteat 's seersucker jacket , then with his thumb and forefinger ran slowly down the edge of the lapel . " This is a nice guy we 're talking about . A pastor . " " Who is n't nice ? " Poteat said . " Everybody 's nice . " " So be nice , will you ? You 've been dead wrong about Nick . " " You 're nice , and I 'm nice , " Poteat said . " This is a nice little town . " " I wo n't keep you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extended his hand . " Thanks much . " " It 's been nice . " Poteat shook his hand . " You 're a sturdy little man of God . " Denbigh drew his fist back to his ear , then punched Poteat lightly on the upper chest . " Thanks much , " he said , and took off down the sidewalk at a trot . Irma Reinwasser took hold of the towel by two corners , and Lizzie and Cornelia each held one of the other two . " Eins , zwei , drei ! " Irma bent over deep from the waist as the two little girls sank all the way down untilp73they were crouched on their heels in the grass where at last the towel lay flat . " There he is ! " Lizzie cried , pointing across the street . Still leaning forward , with one hand at the small of her back , Irma squinted into the sunlight . " Never talk with a stranger , " she said , vaguely , watching him walk into the shadow of the big catalpatree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our names . " Corneliaspoke with exasperation . " Probably he loved us , " Lizzie said , and then with a sudden dreaming look in her eyes , and as if from a great distance , " I 've got something in my pants . " " Schzuein ! " Irma picked her up around the waist and carried her at arm 's length into the house . ' When Poteat reached the Something Shop , he stopped for a while to look at the contents of the window . There was an ancient Victrola with its speaker gaping like a great tin lily , next to it a cast-iron easel supporting a mirror whose glass was held in place by a Revolutionary War soldier and an Indian brave , both bearing American flags . Thrown over the back of a child 's rocker and fanned out like a weddingtrain was a patchwork quilt bound with claretcoloredvelvet , its patches of old damask and brocade stitched here and there with figures  --  a spray of goldenrod , in spidery letters of blue thread the wordsp74Go To Sleep . On one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walrus moustache and a straw hat with Our Pop written in black ink across his shirt-front with a heavy pen . At first glance , Poteat took the shop itself to be empty , but as he studied the cluttered interior more carefully through the glass , he made out the figure of Clem Vail stretched out on a sofa in the back reading a newspaper . He wore khaki shorts with one fuzzy leg pitched out over the arm of the sofa , the other sprawled off to the side so that his bare foot rested on the floor . As Poteat entered , be noticed a Help Wanted placard thumbtacked to the door . Over his head a bell jangled , but Clem did not turn from his reading . Poteat reached up to a shelf and , without looking to see what it was , picked off the first object that his fingers touched  --  a pepper mill  --  and held it out at arm 's length in front of him . " How much ? " Clem craned around to look over his shoulder , his forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No charge to the press . " " I do n't want it . " " What do you want then ? " Clem pulled himself straight on the sofa , crossing his legs and resting the open paper on one knee . Poteat noticed that he had not shaved that morning and wondered if he had spent the night in the shop . " Social notes , " Poteat said . " The comings and goings of Myron 's young bloods . That sort of jazz . "  |p75He  picked up a donkey bell and rang it . " Have you had any major routs up there on the heights recently ? Planning any little trips anywhere ? Your wife ? " " Nothing . " Poteat replaced the bell on the counter and drew several circles around it with his finger . " What does a man do with these things ? Rings them , I suppose . " " God knows . " " Do you need help ? " With his hand on the counter , he had leaned slightly to one side as he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had pushed his bottle-blue glasses back on his forehead when he first entered , and in the dazzle of light his eyes looked almost golden . " Come again ? " Clem was quick and unsure , frowningas he rubbed his stubbly chin with the flat of his hand . The silence belonged to Poteat , and golden-eyed , dimpling , he prolonged it . " Help , " he said . " You 've got a sign out there . " " Oh God . . . " Clem laughed . " Just somebody to sit on things here when I go off to Boston or something . Know of anybody ? " " Your wife 's on strike ? " " She 's not here . " He reached down and started to pull on one sneaker . " Social notes , social notes . " Poteat took the notepaperout of his pocket and cushioned it in the palm of his hand , pinning it there with his pencil stub.  | " It 's just her mother , " Clem said , poking back underthe sofa for his other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone long ? " " Look , buddy . " Clem lurched up off the sofa and stood there with one foot still bare . He was slightly taller than Poteat . " I 'm a shopkeeper . I work . Here , " he said , grabbing a broom from the corner and shovingit toward Poteat . " Here , " he reached into the pocket of his shorts and took out a key-ring which he slid across the counter toward Poteat 's hand . " If you want to help , unlock those cases , sweep Hell out of the floor . Otherwise , old buddy . . . " He smiled expectantly . " Drones do n't work , " Poteat said . " They just wait on the queen 's pleasure . " ' When he reached the door , he paused to breathe on his blue glasses and wipe them before putting them on again . " Thanks much , " he said.  |p77You  do n't want to buy a hotel cheap , do you ? I ask everybody that question . " The thin man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register around . " Muscadine . , . . " He swiveled the wire rack of picture postcards slowly as he spoke  --  Moonlight over Muscadine , Autumn Glory . " It 's the end of the line . It 's the jumping off place . " His amusement was noiseless , a mouthful of neglected teeth . " I 'll make you a good price . " " How much ? " Nicolet took the pen and scratched it at the edge of the blank to start the ink flowing . " Make me an offer . " " I 'll have to sleep on it . " Leaning forward to scrutinize what Nicolet had written , he got in his own light . He reached up and held off to one side the bulb and shade that hung down on a long cord above his head . " Canuck ? " he asked . " Just French . "  | " Well , I ca n't say it , but I can tell you what it means . My wife 's Canuck . La lib , " he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put down . " La liberty . Means liberty . " " They should get you working on the Dead Sea scrolls . " " Turn to the left at the top of those stairs . It 's the third door on your left . That 's two lefts . " He closed the register and replaced the pen in its holder . " Bath at the end of the hall . If you want to go into the hotel business , you can let me know in the morning . " Nicolet tripped on the first step , catching hold of the bannister . " In the morning there may not be any hotel , " he said . There was an iron bed , a bureau with a paper doily under the glass , a straight chair , and no light except for the one fixture in the middle of the ceiling which Nicolet switched off as soon as he had undressedso that he was no longer enclosed in a room but at large in the young night , sitting there in his underwear with his feet up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain had stopped , but a fine mist hung in the air and blurred the street light across from the hotel . He had decided to make no inquiries until morning so she might be lying asleep on the other side of the wall for all he knew , but this was so little of all that the night was rich with that it failed to stir him as he leaned back into the darkness that seemed without walls , the whole world gatheringone by one on the open fields of dreaming , thep79living and the dead . Rene Laliberte , for one . Only as his pen touched the paper downstairs , had the name came back to him  --  the recurring plain-song of Roy 's reminiscence : " My tragic young dad , the grandfather you never saw , who to free his black brother left behind his native France and gave his arm . . . " soft and expectant through the Gregorian dusk of his memory , then the little catch of breath and " . . . in the rifle pits at Petersburg . " Roy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come my sonand on the table by his bed he had enshrined the Brady photograph that showed the sad eyes and curly beard of his father in his Union uniform , over one shoulder a cape to cover the ruined arm . Leon Nicolet . In the rifle pits at Petersburg . Why the alias , Laliberte , Nicolet had never understood until now , suddenlyadopting it himself : a grand new name to match a grand new destiny , liberated from your native France , or from a parish of old ladies , to set at liberty your black brother , or your red-headed sister . It was all the same : to liberate yourself . Nicolet reached out and closed his fingers on the shadow of his grandfather'scape . Well met in Muscadine . You and I , Leon , we understand . For liberation , the loss of an arm might not be too high a price , not even the begetting of Roy , the old and impossible child asleep now in a room like this , Nicolet thought , with a crescent of white hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was thep80price they had asked of the grandfather , what was the price they would ask of him ? He fretted the hair on the back of his neck , looking out at the wet , dark street . Would they ask of him Harold , or was it Haroldhimself who would ask something else ? That afternoon rain had soaked him until you could see the flesh through his shirt . A silent truck driver with a mouthful of popcorn had taken him part of the way , letting him off at a crook in the road by a gravel pit where he took shelter under a lean-to until a boy in chinos and T-shirt stopped and beckoned him in ; by then he no longer cringed through the downpourbut sauntered out , grinning . " Christ , you been swimming the channel ? " The boy 's smooth jaws were working at something as he spoke . Nicolet bent doubleto squeeze rain from his trouser cuffs , and almost cracked his head against the dashboard when the boy started off with a splatter of tires on gravel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes they 're sex fiends or something , " and Nicolet , his face still dripping , replied , " I 'm a minister . " Then the boy had flushed , swallowing whatever it was , and for a mile there was nothing but the tick-tock of the windshield wiper until at last the boy said , " No sweat , what makes a guy decide to be a thing like that ? " " Well , there are three steps , " Nicolet had said distractedly , digging into the inside pocket of his jacket to see if Rooney 's postcard was still there , his walletp81with the dog-eared photograph of the two little girls hugging a snowman that had Franny crouching behind it with her face where the head should have been . " The first step is to be a beer drinker or at least the friend of beer drinkers . It helps anyway . " He laid the postcard on his knee and tried to dab it dry with his handkerchief . The ink had run , but the messagewas still legible : " No one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was a muggy spring evening after exams , " he said , " and I was tossing off a few with some of these beer-drinking friends of mine when the subject got around to religion as it usually does in such cases . I was n't much interested  --  not even the first step had happened yet , you see . But I stuck around and listenedanyway . Nothing to lose . There was one characterthere who had pimples all over his chin like jam . You kept wanting to wipe it off for him . " Nicoletsuddenly remembered whom he was talking to and noticed gratefully that the complexion of the boy was clear and fresh as he frowned ahead at the road through the gouts of rain that quivered against the windshield . " Anyway , " he went on , " he 'd been getting sloppier and sloppier , this pimply one . Everythingwas four letter words . It was really quite funny for a while in a dismal kind of way . Especially when he got into one particular rut . Eats it . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl friend . His roommate . The faculty . They all ate it . It . It " He thought of poor Denbigh . " I hope you do n't think I'mp82talking this way just to sound like one of the fellers . " For the first time , the boy smiled faintly . " Eats it , " Nicolet said . " The great fecal indictment . It 's all he could say . I suppose I should have been able to see what was coming next , but I did n't . We 'd gotten on religion , I told you . Well , he suddenly said a memorable thing , an epic thing  --  at least it was to me . In fact it was step one right there except that like steps two and three I did n't know it was till later . What he said was very simple . He just put together two things I 'd never heard put together before . One of them was eats it . " Nicolet turned the postcard over on his knee and examined the dapper young blade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Muscadine . " And Jesus Christ , " he said , with some effort drawing himself back to what he had been telling the boy . " That was the other thing he said . Accordingto him , Christ eats it too . " Nicolet found himself shivering in his damp clothes so that when he began again , he stammered with cold . The car seemed to be going at somewhat less speed , but otherwise the boy showed no reaction . Nicolet was sorry that he had begun , but he was beyond stoppingnow . " At the time it knocked me for a loop even though I must have been half tight myself . But it was step one , the voice in the burning bush all right whether it sounded much like it then or not . Much later I realized my drinking companion had spoken the truth . Christ does eat it , of course . You know why ? "  |p83The  boy shook his head . " Because it 's all this world has ever given him to eat . And yet he keeps coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel room , Nicolet clenched his face into a terrible grimace and rapped hard on the side of his head to cast out the memory of the bored and disgusted boy who had said only " Christ Almighty ! " as he sat there trapped in his car with this man growing drunk as a child in a tent might grow drunk on the snugness and peace of the rain coming down , this absconded , bluebeard priest babbling out his apologia until he lost all track of his audience . At best the boy must have thought that he was crazy , a sick man ; he had turned on the heater to still his rider 's chattering teeth , but the gush of warm air had only made him drunker , loosening his tongue for step two . Nicolet called out in his dingy room at the memorynow  --  " Holy God , I 'm an ass . . . my father 's son ! " his oath and his prayer  --  and stalked up and down in the dark with both fists clamped tight to his scalp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell the boy , or whomever by then he thought that he was telling , how when Father Ferris spoke , it was like water leaking out of a tap , a rapid drip-drop of word after word until suddenly the words came too many and too fast , mingling and tumbling out in a stream of incoherence ; Father Ferriswas the Guest Master and thus the only monk permitted to speak to visitors although , because of his stroke , it was a rare visitor who came away much thep84wiser . This second step toward becoming a minister , Nicolet explained , was a step into silence . He spared the boy an account of why he had gone . On the grounds of rapidly failing health , old Roy had persuaded him to stay at home that last summer before his graduation from college , promising to teach him the hotel business , but Nicolet had been able to endure it only until August . Roy 's hotel was a house of peelinggingerbread where he lived with his several more or less permanent boarders and where in an improvised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed in his felt slippers and the green and black lumberjack shirt that summer and winter alike he wore as a jacket . Redolent with talcumpowder from his barbering , or perched , roundshouldered , on the high stool where he sat by the stove to stir up the breakfasts that he served to the paying guests , he would soliloquize disjointedly to his son about the difficulties that he had digesting , about making out menus , about defeat and death , sometimes about Leon , until finally Nicolet said goodbye one afternoon and left . Why he had sought out the monasterythen , he had no clear recollection , he said , except that it was not far away , and he was curious , and he must have had questions that he thought might be answered there . Heaven only knew why he had gone , Nicolet told the trapped boy ; Heaven only knew why he was going where he was going now , he said , and bent down to warm his hands where the heat flowed in under the dashboard.  | " None of them spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the memory . He had thought that they would speak to him , the interesting , bony young man , that they would cluster around in their oatmeal-coloredcowls to ply him with answers , marvel at his coming , encourage him to join them in their vows . But instead they rapped wood : rapped on the door of his cell at dawn with a muffled " Christ is risen ! "  --  rapped on the refectory table as they finished their food  --  the abbot clapped his hands to signal the end of their silent meals , and they would file off to the chapel , chanting psalms . At matins and lauds , vespersand complin , he squirmed like an eavesdropper to the sound of lover 's talk ; and when he met them in corridors , not even good morning , good night . They would only nod and smile as though it was some joke too rich for telling . Round-eyed and quick as a bird , Father Ferris did what he could to make amends , but then his words would start to run together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third day , I rose from the dead and went home , " Nicolet said . " All the time I spent there smarting under the silence  --  the Great Silence they called it  --  I never thought of speaking to the only one who might have listened and might even have said something worth hearing . Althoughwhat he said , of course , was the silence itself . " His eyes brimming with his drunkenness , Nicolet placed his finger to his lips . " The second step , " he whispered . There had been no time for the third because theyp86reached the narrow tar turn-off to Muscadine and the boy let him out , lingering for a moment to watch him cross the highway , then shaking his head or wavingor crossing himself  --  it was hard to be sure through the misted window  --  as his car leapt forward and away . The rain had stopped by then , and Nicolet completed the remaining five miles or so on foot . He pulled only the sheet over him now and lay back with the one limp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the ceiling . Would Irma remember their prayers , he wondered , not that it much mattered : Lizard Boy stopping in the middle of hers to squeal up from the nest of fur animals as her feet found his face bent over her in the dark , " Bluebeard 's whiskering me ! " Then Cornelia 's " Our Father who are n't . . . "  --  " Who art , little Pie Face . . . "  --  " Are n't , are n't ! "  --  hilariously , and after all , that was the secret , he thought : the laughter . And that was also the third step which he found that he had to finish off now as he rolled over on his stomach , pressing his lips to the hot pillow . Whenever in their fashion the old ladies asked him the boy 's question  --  " No sweat , what makes a guy decide ? "  --  he had spoken always gravely of a process rather than any one event , of a slow pursuit rather than the sudden blaze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censored out because they expected this gravity from him , and he saved all his terrible faces , his dancingsin the rain , for the children and Franny , for Rooney . But there had been an event , and he assembledthe old girls now in his bedroom to hear it  --  withp87little whimpers they leapt like cats to the bureau top , radiator , foot of his bed . In a pulpit with a top like an orange press , the college preacher had plucked uneasily at the dead air as the oaken hood seemed to drop lower and lower , pressing out of him nothing that you could not have expected : like Caesar , the Lord had refused a crown when the Tempter offered it  --  " all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time "  --  yet again and again in the hoping heart of the believer he was crowned , yes , of course , " crowned amidst confession and tears , " the preacher said , yes , his tone so sepulchral that it could have been Roy 's except for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " crowned amidstgreat laughter . " The preacher had barely paused at the phrase , but it was the end and the beginning of Nicolet : the great laughter at the heart of silence , the incredulous laughter and rain dance of faith . It was his third step , the most that he had in the way of event , and he smoothed it out now in the dark and let his head sink down heavy on it . Dear Harold , who art andare n't , neither and both  --  who takest to eat what the world gives . . . show us thy hand . The old catsscattered when without warning he tripped and fell backwards into sleep . With the razor he borrowed the next morning from the man at the desk , he cut himself just below the cheekbone . He tasted the blood at the corner of hisp88mouth before he saw it in the narrow strip of mirror above the basin , and he did not staunch it until he had finished shaving the other cheek so that by then it had become a gaudy sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought , remembering for the first time his new identity . He had woken to the thought again that Rooney might be asleep on the other side of the wall from him , and as soon as he got downstairs , he asked if she was staying there only to be told that except for himself there was nobody stayingthere . " I tell you , you can have this place cheap , " his friend said . " Is there an antique shop , an oracle in a cave  --  any kind of famous landmark ? " Nicolet asked , looking through the picture postcards . " Why would a person come to Muscadine ? " " Most of them come to die . " His noiseless amusementcracked his mouth open so wide that Nicolet was not prepared for the sudden sharpness of his question . " Why did you come yourself ? Are you a cop with all these questions ? " " I 'm just a tragic young dad . " Even as he spoke , he caught sight through the front window of the figure of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the glint of sun on her hair , the pitch of her shoulders , he was sure that he recognized Rooney . By the time that he reached the hotel porch , she had disappeared , and he stood there with his hand on the railing scanning the street as the morning breeze teeteredthe empty rocking chairs . Then he saw her again . She had crossed to the other side and was walking rap/idly away , not turning to the sound of her name as he called it out . He clattered down the wooden steps and along the sidewalk to the corner , then crossed the street at a run with a dog at his heels now , barking , and finally overtook her at the entrance to a drug store where he caught her by the elbow from behind . " Raggedy Ann ! " The face that the woman turned to him was a stranger 's face , leathery and coarse-featured , starkly alien . " Are you crazy ? " She held her groceries between them like a shield . Or a cop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there had been so many theories since Myron that it was hard to be sure as she entered the store and pushed the glass door shut on his apologies so that he was left with his own reflection : his grey suit wrinkled and shapeless from yesterday 's rain , his hair uncombed and a shred of toilet paper marking the cut on his cheek . The pharmacist in a white jacket appeared at the door to stare out at him , through the glass , and protesting his innocence with a shrug , a foolishly smiling shake of his head , Nicolet turned and continued back down the sidewalk . He tried to smooth down his hair with the flat of his hands , then plucked off the piece of paper and started again the slow trickle of blood that he dabbed at with his handkerchiefas he walked . The dog that had joined him in his chase across the street trotted along at his side and licked his fingers when he paused across from the hotel . Suddenly then as he patted the dog 's warm head ,  |p90the  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunlit combers of wind that kept the rockers nodding and himself now Laliberte with the bright world openingbefore him like a hand , a flower . He wondered idly what had been so tragic about the other Laliberte . Certainly not his wound which had been little enough to pay for the cape and the sad eyes  --  Nicolet glanced wryly at the handkerchief stained with the mystery of his own blood  --  yet Roy had always insisted on the tragedy as of course he would , and so Nicolet had never more than half listened  --  some cruel disillusionment , some forgotten scandal . Poor Leon , but in its terrible beauty the world itself was a scandal , and the lightness of his own heart . He thought of the word beauty ' that Franny had not scratched off her shopping list and of how not even her death had been able to scratch it off for him because the world was as beautiful still without her . Forgive me , my dear , and he smelled breakfast on the air , gave the dog a slap on the rump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was after he had eaten and was wandering from shop to shop down the one real street in Muscadine that he saw Rooney again , and this time there could be no doubt . He had discovered that there was no other hotel in town where she could be staying  --  he had searched through the telephone directory to see if there was any name that he might recognize as a relative or friend  --  and finally there seemed nothing left to do but wait around there in as many places asp91possible , keeping watch . It might take hours , of course , days  --  she might have left Muscadine or never come at all  --  and he entertained himself with the absurdity of finally buying the hotel after all and settling down to run it for no other reason than that someday years later , unfrocked and dishonored , he might shuffle downstairs in his slippers to find that at last she had arrived . Then Roy again  --  the old man 's wires reached him even in his dreaming . God knew what Roy Nicolet waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son . And then Nicolet saw her . He had raised a little souvenir cushion to his nose  --  I Pine for you and Balsam  --  and was breathing in the fragrance of the needles when he looked out of the shop door and saw her coming down the street long before she saw him . She had the walk of someone going nowhere in particular , a face so unguarded , so flagrantly itself in this place where she could have expected no one so much as to notice her that he felt that his own long glance was a kind of betrayal . And then she saw him . " My God , you look like the last bloody rose of summer . " " I 've been thinking of you in Muscadine , " he said , and puffing out his chest , he crooked one knee and took a long drag on his invisible cigar , then let the smoke escape as he flicked off the ashes fastidiously.  |p92CLEM  called me the day after you left , " Nicolet said . " You did n't even tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did you tell him ? " " I did n't get your card till after he 'd called . " " Did you call him back then and tell him ? " Nicolet shook his head . " Why did you come , Nick ? " " I came to bring you back . " " I would have come back anyway . " " Clem did n't think so . I did n't either . I wanted you back . " " Do you say that to all your lost sheep ? " " You 're my first . It 's the break I 've been waiting for . " Through the same woods where Rooney had wanderedalone the afternoon before , they had followed an old logging road as far as a partial clearing knee deep in ferns . Rooney sat between the roots of ap93bully oak , leaning against the great , baffled trunk with its little jutting shelves of fungus . Some distanceaway , Nicolet sat on a fallen branch , and betweenthem the ferns trembled more gold than green in the morning sun . " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nicoletplucked a spear of grass and placed it between his two thumbs , cupping his hands together . " . . . that she said that . . . " and he blew a long , hoarse note . " I wrote you not to come . " " In a pig 's sweet eye . " She smiled . " Did he cry ? " " Clem ? " He glanced up at her inquiringly over his hands . " Not a drop . " " I 've seen him cry . Men do n't have the faces for it . " " Do n't tell me about it . " " Why did you want me back , Nick ? " He looked to her as though he was paying no attention , shielding his eyes from the sun as he glanced up into the branches of the tree that rose above her . His thin lips were slightly parted , and the shadow of his hand blackenedthe upper part of his face like a mask . " That 's my job , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digging in their heels ? " " The ones I deal with mostly do n't even knowthey 've gone away . How do you bring back a respectableold body who thinks she 's never left ? " " Back where ? A respectable young body . . " Back to Myron , " he said , " to Clem . " " But it 's so pathetic ! " For a moment she held herp94hands out to him . " You come all this way , scratched and bleeding , to get me to do what I would have done anyhow . You 're such a clown , Nick . " With a clown 's face , dark among the ferns on his branch , he smiled at her . " If the boys at headquarters get wind of it , I 'm through , of course . My one big chance , and I flub it . " " Then it was just for Clem you came ? " " Maybe I 'm in the wrong line of work . " " It must have been unnerving for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . Found near Muscadine : a runaway red bitch with circles under her eyes . ' Then what ? Rightful owner , ' " Rooney said , " please claim . ' Poor old Nick , wondering who the rightful owner might really be at this point . At least wondering if Myron might wonder once word got around that I 'd gone . Did n't you think you 'd sleep easier yourself  --  not just Clem  --  if you got me back to him quick ? " Speaking slowly , his expression half puzzled , half amused , he struck her as feeling his way to something that would suddenly light up everything . " You know , I think I really came because I loved the name of Muscadine . If you 'd gone to a place named anything else , I might n't have budged an inch . " " You 're a runaway too , are n't you , Nicko ? " " My father was , and his father before him . " " Where are we running ? " " You can never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his branch and tossed it out between them.  | " A clearing in the woods for the moment . It gives you a chance to get your bearings . " He squinted up at what there was of the sky . " Home would be behind us . That way . " He pointed . " We have to go home , do n't we , Rooney ? " " You came all this way just to say so . " " I want to hear you say so . " " Listen , I was a horse till I was eighteen . I could keep going for miles . " " Denbigh , " Nicolet said . " My little brother in the Lord . " " Little Ralph ? " " I 'm trying it out on him now , just a game . " " You mean if we kept on running ? " With his eyes shut tight , Nicolet nodded . " I 'm trying to see what it would do to his face . It 's a brave little eager face . No , " he shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would do to it . " " That 's a ghastly game , " Rooney said . " I see Clem 's . " " Do n't . " Nicolet held up one hand , his eyes still closed . " All I can get of Poteat are those heavy-duty dimples and a mouthful of teeth . Chomp , chomp . " He opened his eyes then to her silence and gazed at her through the green air . Her face looked white against the dark tree . " It 's home for us , Raggedy Ann . " " All I wanted was somebody to hold my hand in Muscadine . That 's not so much . " Through her frowning , she smiled at him . " I could n't bring Clemp96because I did n't even want him to know where I was going . " " Afraid he 'd laugh ? " " Dear God , I was afraid he 'd cry . You ca n't guess what it means to him , Nicko  --  having a child . It got to be that every month when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so late for some reason , he 'd make some wild excuse for not going to work just so he 'd be there to find out as soon as I did whether this time . . . it had worked . And of course it was always the same bloody business . Bloody , " she said with a terrible little laugh . " Now he wo n't even talk about it . I did n't want to get him excited about Mrs. Flagg , and God knows I 've lied to him enough already , so I just took off the way I did . " " Has she worked a miracle for you , your Lillian Flagg ? " " The miracle was really her taking me in at all . I just arrived without warning . You know who told me about her ? Franny . Just that she was supposed to be the real thing . . . if there is a real thing . Her name always stuck in my mind . " " I 'd never connected her with Muscadine , " Nicolet said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spoke absently . " Come to Muscadine and die . Maybe the dying comes first . " " She 's tried to teach me how to pray , and I 'm lousy at it . She 's prayed for me . I thought I 'd die when she started except she 's so matter-of-fact  --  like the president of a woman 's club . But it would kill you ,  |p97Nick  . They 're so corny , the prayers . She admits it . She always says them to Jesus , and she says it 's important to call him that  --  not Christ or Lord or anything  --  because Jesus is the part of his name that embarrasses people to death when they use it alone , just Jesus . She says that underneath that embarrassmentis the part of us that 's revolted by him . It 's so damned queer . So you say Jesus to get that part out in the open where he can get at it . " " Cornelia says Harold . " " You 'd die , you 'd die . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 've got to tell you about it because you 're the first person I 've seen since I got here . It 's been so queer , Nick . I do n't believe anything much , God knows , but sometimes I thought I could feel somethinghappening . Once in the rain . She lays her hands on your head , and the prayer is really just her talking about you to him . She could be talking to anybody , nothing fancy . Once she even laughed because he alreadyseemed to be doing what she was asking him to do , not a creepy laugh , but the way if a child does something especially clever . She said it was amazing what God could do on his own sometimes . What she asked him to do for me was to walk back through my memory , as though it was a long hall . She asked him to open all the closed doors , and to bless whatever he found inside . Is it just mumbo-jumbo , Nick ? " She lit a cigarette when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that she was listening stillp98to the echo of her own words rather than for whatever he might find to say in reply . For the moment he could find nothing ; yes and no alike were only grammar , rhetoric . As Nicolet , he felt that he could have managed one or the other , but as Laliberte he could only marvel at a face made for braving the sight of an ocean , a child , the disorder of her garden , as it gazed now instead through the smoke from her cigarette into the silences that as a runaway he was himself running away from or towards . " I 'm not a mystic , " he said . " I 'm a cop . A firm but friendly guardian of the moral order . I bring wives back to husbands and husbands back to wives . " " You look like a mystic , " Rooney said . " You look like St. Francis about to start preaching to the birds . " With his face tilted up to watch the shimmering canopy of leaves above her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he squatted on the rotting branch , the position of his body had already made him a supplicant so that at the suggestion from her it was a matter only of sinking the few inches left to the earth . He spread out his arms in a gesture half beseeching , half exhorting . " Feathery ladies , little sisters , break the silence with your glad evangels . . . . " In the interval of their saying nothing , the sounds of the clearing drifted to the surface  --  crickets , a thrush , the distant barking of a dog . His arms began to ache , and the sun was hot ; down his narrow , blue jaw he felt a ripple of flame as all about him beatingp99wings descended . " Twitter , twitter , cheep , cheep , cheep , " he said in a tiny voice . " I 'm famous for my imitations of saints . You should see me do the martyrdomof Polycarp . " Rooney smiled uncertainly , as if she had noticed nothing . " I 've got memories that need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh Lord , I 'm an ass ! " He sprang to his feet and scrambled to her through the ferns , crouching down beside her . She was Sarah and Hannah and Elizabeth , the barren wife all freckled and damp-eyed among the shadows as he clowned in the sun ; she was the sheep of his pasture , Raggedy Ann , his beloved , his child . " I 've got to spew it out at somebody . Be good to me , Nick . " Slowly with her fingertips she traced vague circles on the little patch of earth between them as if to conjure him into not hearing what she had to tell him , glancing away from him into the woods as she spoke . In a room stained crimson with sunset she had cuckolded Clem in his own junkshop with the wind off the river smelling of mud . The fall of their first year at Myron she had clung to a stranger without a name and drowned with him in the crimson depths of her boredom ; she had ruined his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for him or lust , and all of this she translated now for Nicolet into a language so remote and muted that he was tempted to pass it over as only a troubling dream until she glanced up atp100him suddenly with a face that even now was drowning . To save her , he knew , would be somehow to save himself ; and as if in search of something that would set them both free he studied that face which seemed to float there in the sunlight so close to his own that he saw it magnified out of perspective : a single , still eye , the shadow dividing her lips , a wisp of hair the color of autumn . Only her face seemed real to him , the delicate flesh and muscle of it , the tanned cheek which his fingers touched for a moment as he might have touched a fern or the bark of the tree . That was perhaps the truth that he looked for : that only what you could touch was real , and the corridor of the past with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a dream . Rooney 's betrayal of Clem , his own betrayalof Roy , of Franny by slowly forgetting her  --  it was all just smoke that one sweep of a living hand could brush from his eyes . The outrageous simplicity of the solution tempted him to smile , and only her one tear stopped him . It trembled , glistening , down the side of her nose . " You could have done so much worse , you know , " and then he had to smile , the whole fullness of her grief hanging to her nostril like a rance 's pearl . " Cruelty , bitterness , self-pity  --  they take root in the soul and keep growing . But this , six years ago . . . . It exists only by being remembered . So much betterjust to forget it now , and better for Clem too . Better for God . "  |p101Even  as he spoke , he saw the hopelessness of what he told her  --  forgetting was a state of grace , after all , not an act of the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not the meaning of the words seemed right as she touched away the tear with her knuckle . He knew that it was not the language of Nicolet or of Mrs. Flagg that he spoke  --  no call to repentance , no prayer for the memory 's healing  --  but the language of Laliberte : Forget it , forget it . You bade farewell to your native France , you left the old man in his lumberjack shirt to stir up breakfast for the paying guests , in the morning loveliness of Muscadineyou put behind you once and for all the sunset and the stranger . You liberated yourself . " This afternoon or tomorrow , " Nicolet said , " I'lI take you back to Myron , to Clem . No more brooding . Right now is all that matters . The rest is nothing . . . noplace . . . and the way the world goes , what happened was so little . God knows . In my line of work , you get to be an expert . And it 's never happenedagain , has it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened at all , " Rooney said . " I 've seen him again off and on  --  just by accident , on the street somewhere . We never speak even . Maybe that 's the worst of it . I do n't know why I ca n't tell you his name . " She shook her head . " Honor among thieves . " Nicolet got to his feet and offered his hand to help her up . " Starting now , " he said , " do n't think of anything in Muscadine . Just think of Muscadine in Mus/cadine . And as for the baby . . . " With a pang of homesickness , he remembered kissing Lizzie 's sleepingeyelids when he had left at daybreak the morning before , and for an instant he could not think what he had been about to say . " I 'm sure Mrs. Flagg 's word carries great weight in high places . " She stood beside him brushing off her skirt , unconsciousfor the moment of anything else as with her bare head bowed she picked off a burr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have mercy on me for hating the stranger . " You make an awfully queer minister , " she said . " But thank you for coming , Nicko . " For envying the stranger . " It all seems so easy , " Rooney said as they walked through the rustling ferns . And for several hours after that it continued to seem easy  --  as if they had reached the summit of a hill above the battle , their view of the turbulence into which they would have to descend soon enough only deepening the momentary sense of reprieve . Nicolet remembered that he had never paid for his room at the hotel so Rooney drove him back and , while he paid , bought sandwiches and milk for their lunch which they ate in the car as they drove slowly through the countryside , not stopping anywhere on the road because it was only as long as they kept moving from landscape to landscape that they felt safe from whateverit was that menaced them , safe from any necessity to talk , safe from each other . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with summer , they drove for miles of easy silence through the woods around Muscadine with Rooney at the wheel and Nicolet leaning back in the seat beside her , his face turned toward the rush of soft air . It was not until mid-afternoon that they decided to stop back at Lillian Flagg 's for Rooney 's belongings and return to Myron that day . It was Lillian Flagg who persuaded them to wait . What Rooney had told him about her and what he alreadyknew of her as a healer , a guardian of Christianmysteries , had not prepared Nicolet for the portly little figure in overalls and a coolie hat who appeared out of the garden where she had been weeding , a smudge of dirt on her chin and the weary-eyed , puffcheekedsmile as she shook his hand when Rooney introduced them and announced their plan to leave . " Your parish can stagger along without you another few hours , I expect , " she said almost as soon as they met , her smile still there but as though she had entirelyforgotten it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like you to stay here this evening . You can go home tomorrow any time you please . Both of you . Do n't be frightened , Mr. Nicolet . Oh dear no . . . " She sounded a little out of breath , opening her eyes wider for a moment , like turning up a lamp , and then , as if she had seen all that she needed , completingher smile . " I 've been known to eat two or three little pastors like you for my breakfast , but as Mrs. Vail knows , I 've just recently had my fill , so do n't bep104nervous . We 'll have a sherry before supper . " Then , taking Rooney by the hand , she disappeared back to the weeds , and Nicolet , having been pressed into staying , found himself abandoned by the sagging porch steps of the bungalow . Was she a great warrior of the faith , or a deluder of the credulous , a deluder of herself ? Could the line be drawn neatly at all ? The best that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place your bet , but when he had tried to do so , he had found her looking so much more masterfully into his that he had glanced away . Was she asking herself the same question about him , he wondered : a warrior of the faith , or jolly Saint Nick , as Poteat had written of him , off on a spree . Nicolet had seen , of course , the references to himselfand to Rooney in Poteat 's column in the Repository , but they had troubled him little and Rooney even less , apparently , because she had never mentionedthem to him . Yet at the thought of Poteat now , he winced  --  at the recognition that somewhere in the shadows of his thoughts , largely nameless and faceless , Poteat had been lurking all along . The man himselfNicolet scarcely knew : he had appeared at church a few Sundays , always arriving just in time for the sermon and leaving before the final hymn , but apart from that he had seen him only in passing as he shambled down Main Street asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New England landscape were scattered among ironic sketches of life in Myron and cumbersome innuendop105directed against whatever had happened that week to catch his pale and simmering eye . " He 's got it in for you , old man , " Denbigh had said to him once . " You better go heap some coals of fire on his head by being nice , " and surely if Poteat were to see him now , Nicoletthought , he would find all his hostilities justified  --  jolly Saint Nick , the philandering padre , idling away a late June afternoon with his red-headed doxy and her conjure-woman while his old ladies teetered unshriven towards death , his trustees snarled at their canceled meeting , and even his own children did not know his whereabouts . It would be almost time for their supper . Irma called them in toward the end of the afternoon to clean up , and they ate in the kitchen at five  --  sometimes in silence so sleepy and drunk on warm food and summer that they would forget to chew , just sitting there blankly with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wicked , talking bathroom talk and bubbling their milk , playingtheir endless games of You be Bluebeard and I 'll be Raggedy Ann  --  I see something yellow and it 's not on the table , not on the wall . Nicolet climbed the porch steps and entered the living room . The breeze through the window had upset a jelly-glass of wildflowers  --  pearlyeverlasting , tansy and yarrow  --  and he set it up again , mopping the water with his bloodstainedhandkerchief . A fly buzzed across the low ceiling . It took him some time to find the telephone which stood on a wicker table half hidden by a pile ofp106books  --  The Late Mrs. Null , The Cloud of Unknowing  --  andwhen the operator asked him for his name , he faltered through the spelling of Nicolet , then waited in silence with the receiver pressed into his cheek so that one corner of his mouth was drawn back in a lopsided smile . " Wie geht 's , Irma ? her ist dein Freund , Til Eulenspiegel . " Her indignation soothed him , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his eyes closed . He could hear first her muffled cry of " Bluebeard ! " to the children , followed by the clatter of their feet , some German expletive . " At last you are letting us know you are alive ! " she said . " The children keep asking , Irma , has he gone to Heaven ? ' and all I can say is , It 's your father who knows about I-Ieaven , you ask him when he comes back if that 's where he was . ' How do I know what to tell them ? Everybody is asking me where you have gone , so I tell them nothing like you said , and the church woman , she thinks I 'm crazy . I 'm going crazy here . Mr. Vail called  --  I know nothing . Mr. Denbigh left just a few minutes ago . He brought shovels for the children  --  very nice . Now I throw away all the rusty ones , today they took your shoes out and filled them with sand . You want I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday ? I 'm not even a Christian , and you 've got me running a church . Stop it , stop it Lizzie ! " It was like a cageful of birds , the fierce whispers , the clinking of china in the background . Rules and Exercises for Holy Dying , Thep107Scandal of Father Brown  --  he ran his fingers alongtheir spines until he could hear her back and breathingagain . " As of now , you can consider yourself an honorary Christian , " he said . He spoke quietly , pinching his eyes shut again with his thumb and forefinger . " I 'll be driving back tomorrow with Mrs. Vail . " " Also , she is with you then . . . . So now what do I say ? " The excitement was gone , her voice hushed now and breathy , and in the pause that followed he had a clear vision of her standing there in the kitchen with the receiver touching her mouth  --  the frizzled grey hair , the goblin face  --  as her question trembled across the miles between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's presence with him he had betrayedhis guiltiest secret . She was prepared to say whatever he told her to say , to protect him at whatevercost even as a wife , he thought , would have tried to protect him , and for a moment Irma Reinwasser became a wife , and he answered her in the accents of melodrama , sighing deeply with his hand on his heart . " Say that to the end I have resisted her every wile and kept myself faithful to you . . . my own true love . " He could hear the children calling , " Irma , Irma ! " but from her no sound . " Irma ? " he said . " I am still here . " " I was worried about her . I came to bring her back , that 's all . " " Everywhere now people are worrying . . . all the world . " " Do n't you worry , Irma .

" " Is this my old Liz ? How 's my wiggler ? " There was a long silence , then as if from far away the husky little voice . " Fine . " " Have you been a good baby ? " " Fine . " " What did you do today ? " " I do n't want to talk any more . " She said this toIrma , speaking around her thumb ; her enormous eyeswere dazed , Nicolet knew . Her hair needed cutting . " Hi . " " Is this my Pie Face ? " " Yes . " Her voice was deep and tremulous . " Where are you ? " " I 'm in Muscadine . I 'm coming home tomorrow . " " We thought you were in Heaven . " " Talk louder , little one . Do you miss me ? " " We saw a man with a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw a lady with red hair . Have you been having a good time with Irma ? " " Yes . " " Did you have fun putting sand in your old Dad 's shoes ? " " Just some of them . That 's all right . I have to go now . " " Hey , wait a sec . Can I talk to Irma again ? "  | " She went upstairs . " " What did Lizzie just say ? " " She said Irma was crying . " " Of course she was n't crying . What is there to cry about ? " " Lizzie said it . " " You and Lizzie go up and say goodbye to her for me . I 'll be home tomorrow . " " Goodbye . " " Goodbye , little ones . " The whole room where he sat was transformed by her tears , if tears they were , if Lizzie was to be believed  --  thesaddest room , suddenly , that he had ever seen : the faded pillows and the peacock feather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the birch-bark silhouettes of trout curling away from the wall where they were nailed . He had never seen Irma cry . Rooney 's had been a single tear , crystalline , an adornment ; Irma 's would be rivulets streaking the large-pored cheeks and tracing the great baroque curves of flaring nostril  --  Savonarola retching at the stake . From such a sight you hid your eyes , and Nicoletleaned forward with his face in his hands , hummingtunelessly . He had a strong sense of waiting for something more than just the return of the two women , more even than his own return to his parish , his children , yet what it was he could not have said . But for whateverit was , Lillian Flagg set the stage with remarkablespeed . She had come in from the garden chat/tering to Rooney about aphids and the ladybugs that you could get from California to devour them ; she had plumped the pillows , swatted the flies , lit the lamp , as he and Rooney had stood by awkwardly , avoiding each other 's eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change their clothes beforesupper , leaving Nicolet to prepare himself as best he could at the mirror above the kitchen sink where he recoiled , grimacing , from the reflection of the cut on his cheek , the blue stubble of beard and his wild hair . In less time then than he would have thought possible , Lillian Flagg had come down again in a flame blue dress with a little cape and a brooch at her throat , her face startlingly pale but fresh and quick as she brought in the tray of sherry and glasses . " Mrs. Vail is going to have a little snooze till supper so we 'll have to kill this all by ourselves . " She motioned him to the couch and sitting down in the wing chair facing him , raised her glass to him in silence , drank a third of it , and wiped her mouth with a tiny handkerchief . " Have you ever received the gift of the Spirit , Mr. Nicolet ? " For a moment he could not think what she was talking about , the vivid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look of faint amusement . " The Holy Spirit , " she said , and at this positively smiled . " Oh , oh . . . " He raised his hand to her to wait a moment , swallowing the sherry hard . " If I rememberrightly , are n't there lots of different kinds of gifts ? "  | " Yes , I know , I know . First Corinthians twelve . Healing . Tongues . Prophecy . " She brushed them all away . " I do n't mean the frills . I mean the real business . The spirit that resurrected Jesus from the dead shall also give life to your mortal bodies . ' The life , " she said . " That 's what I mean . " Nicolet shook his head . " I did n't think so , " she said . " You get so you can tell . Pray for it , Nicolet . Nothing else really matters , you know . " " Have you received it ? " He watched her closely , his eyebrows raised , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the table would start rapping , the birch-bark fish would peel off the wall and float shimmering through the dusk on silken threads . " Oh dear , yes . " With a tidy little sigh she took anothersip from her glass . " Otherwise I would n't be here now . I 'd have dried up and blown away long ago . " She repeated the trick with her eyes : when you thought that they were wide open , they would open wider still for a moment , apparently quite independent of the rest of her face or of what she was saying . " How was it ? " Nicolet asked . " All it 's cracked up to be ? " It surprised him to find suddenly that he dislikedher . Who , looking at them , would take her for the professional , he wondered , and himself for the fumbling dilettante , or was this part of the divine absurdity , part of the great laughter ? In any event , he was unable now to laugh , much as he wished that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff and unmanageable as he sat there at her bidding , drinking her sherry , with the knowledge that , whatever the justice of her claims , it was to her and not to him that Rooney had gone for some kind of rescue . " It was in the days when I was much more mixed up with individual healings than I am now , and I 'd come to the end of my rope . I was all out of juice . So I came back to Muscadine to ask for help . I prayed for a shot in the arm , for more strength to heal . And you know what I was given ? " Nicolet shrugged . " Absolutely nothing . I was afraid I was through , all right . I 'd thought I was pretty hot stuff . And I was , you know . But then I had enough sense to pray for guidance . I said , Lord , what do you want me to pray for now ? ' And the answer came through quite clearly . Pray for the Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assure you , because I 'd always assumed with the healings and all that I already had it  --  whateverit was . Right in this room I prayed , " she said , " and right in this room I received . " " Amid tongues of fire ? " Nicolet asked . " A mighty rushing wind ? " " If you 'd been here , you would n't have seen a thing . I did n't . It was all inside  --  an intense burning in the middle of the head . You ca n't work that up on your own  --  there 's so much you can , but not that . I 've tried . Some kind of change in the air of the room , a fragrance . And joy , Nicolet . Joy . Joy . " She pelted himp113with the word , the brooch at her throat glittering as she leaned forward to set her empty glass on the table . " Joy splashing like a fountain and spilling out over the sides . The certainty of it , Nicolet . Truer than you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hallelujah ! Praise the Lord ! Revival talk , little man . And nothing , nothing , is ever the same again . " He knew that for the first time now he had her at his mercy , that to laugh if he could , to make a face , to be Saint Francis again and preach to the fish , to the dead fly , would be to destroy her unless  --  and his face trembled with the effort of holding it still  --  unless she were to laugh out with him , throw back her head and drown his laughter in hers . " Just like that , " he said , snapping his fingers . " Never a doubt again ? Never the impulse to run ? " " Oh , there are still the ups and downs  --  life moves . And the downs can be deep and dark . But underneath , always , the joy . Like an underground spring . There now , " she said . " Those are my credentials , such as they are . They 're what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All I wanted was to go home , " Nicolet said . " You told me to stay , for some occult reason . " Lillian Flagg leaned back tiredly in her chair , restingher chin on her fingertips . " Do n't hate me , Mr. Nicolet . You 're the one who can help her , not I. " " I hope I 've helped her already . I do n't hate you . " " Then prepare to , " she said . " Because you 've done nothing for her . Somebody 's got to tell you that . "  |p114There  was the sound of Rooney 's footsteps crossing the floor above their heads , the closing of a door , and in the silence that followed , their eyes met with such a depth of complicity that for a few moments Nicolet could not disengage himself enough to address her . " I think that was a human being that just passed by . . . on her way to the john . " There was a rumbleof water in the pipes as he managed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as for an instant he had intended , but held her there at arm 's length with a kind of bemused affection . " Not really ours at all , Mrs. Flagg , to help much or harm much  --  whoeverin Hell we think we are . She 'll ride our advice like her horse , wherever she wants . " " Nicolet , I may adopt you . " She ran her hands briskly up and down her bare arms , never taking her eyes from him . " Oh Lord , how advice bores me , especially when it 's good . And yours was good enough . Go back to your husband . ' That probably did n't come so easy , did it ? Forget your infidelity . ' She told me , you see . It 's so modern , and it 's so sane , and it 's just the advice she 'd want if she wanted advice . Only give her what she really wants , Nicolet . " " Give her what , for Christ 's sake ? " " For Christ 's sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then let it out slowly , shaking her head . " The only thing you have to give . " And then she almost shouted at him . " Forgive her for Christ 's sake , little priest ! " " But she knows I forgive her . "  | " She does n't know God forgives her . That 's the only power you have  --  to tell her that . Not just that he forgives her the poor little adultery . But the faces she ca n't bear to look at now . The man 's . Her husband 's . Her own , half the time . Tell her he forgives her for being lonely and bored , for not being full of joy with a houseful of children . That 's what sin really is . You know  --  not being full of joy . Tell her that sin is forgivenbecause whether she knows it or not , that 's what she wants more than anything else  --  what all of us want . What on earth do you think you were ordainedfor ? " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when Rooney came downstairs smelling faintly of soap from her bath , and the conversationturned entirely to objects  --  what there was in the refrigerator for supper , the best road back to Myron  --  he wondered even if his talk with Lillian Flagg had taken place anywhere but in his head . Nothing in her manner now indicated that she had any memory of it , and between the flame blue of her dress , the yellow and amber of Rooney 's , he felt like a shadow in his rumpled suit the color of fog . What was this house , who were these women ? The chirpingof crickets came in waves through the open windows , the sherry was sweet and warm on his tongue , and the green ferns of the clearing that morning rustled in his mind as he smiled pointlessly while they chattered on in a language that he felt he had not sufficiently mastered to join in himself . Irma wasp116weeping in her bedroom , the children hushed in their bibs at her door . He had signed his grandfather 's name in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I 'm intoxicated , " and they seemed barely to acknowledgehis departure then to stand for a while alone on the front steps watching the last bands of salmon sky dwindle on the horizon . When he came in again through the back door and found Lillian Flagg peering into the oven to see if the chicken pies were done , he made a gesture to Rooney of pushing her in and slamming the door shut behind her . " Before she gets us , " he whispered as she carried their plates into the dining room . " The house is made of gingerbread , you know . I just tasted a piece of the porch . She 's fattening us up . " But Rooney 's smile was vague , unlistening , and it was only once they were seated at table and Lillian Flagg asked him to bless their food that he felt himself coming back into some kind of focus . " For all thy mercies known and unknown , remembered and forgotten , " he said , " we give thee thanks this night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been ordained : kneeling on the sanctuary steps half smothered by the black robes of the ministers with the trembling weight of all their hands hot on his scalp  --  " Bestow upon him the grace of thy holy spirit , confirming in Heaven what we do in thy church on earth . . . let the same mind be in him which was also in Christ Jesus . " The moderator had been a Negro with the face of a pharaoh , epicene ,  |p117bird-boned  , and old Roy had sat in the second pew with a handkerchief pressed against his mouth . Now the plate burned the knuckles of his clenched hands , but he did not draw them away , glancing at Rooney with her head bowed self-consciously low in the candlelight , Lillian Flagg sitting up stiffly with her eyes closed . " Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness , for they shall be filled . " They ate almost entirely in silence , and soon after they finished , Lillian Flagg said goodnight and went upstairs . When they had washed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down on the windowseatwith her legs curled under her . " Go to bed , will you , Nick ? You look like death , and I do n't have two words left to rub together . " For a moment he had almost obeyed her , longing above all things to obey her as he stood there with his hand on the newel post , one foot on the stairs , so tired all of a sudden that the lamplight seemed to dim and brighten with his pulse . Then he slowly walked the great distance to where she sat and stood beside her , looking down at her profile bright against the dark panes as she gazed away from him at nothing . With his palms flat against her temples , he tipped her face to him , and she raised her own hands and pressed them against his so that each seemed to be preventing the other 's escape while robed in shadow he heard himself pronouncelike a stranger , " The almighty and merciful God pardon and deliver you , forgive you every face you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw wasp118Raggedy Ann with a mouth stitched shut in a ragged smile and the shoebutton eyes shining bright for maybe no more than a child to maul and mother her to life.  |p119IT  WAS because the young Hauptscharfuhrer , Heinz Taffel , took it into his head that she looked like a chicken that Irma Reinwasser had survived her imprisonment . He had been standing in a tar-paper shack warming his hands at the coal stove when he saw her stumbling through the snow with a rope over her shoulders knotted to a bundle of railroad ties that she was dragging toward the new section of track being built on the outskirts of the camp , and he had laughed out loud at the sight . Her head wobbled back and forth as she moved , picking her feet up high to avoid the drifts , and with her skin turned yellow and the great beak of her nose bobbing up and down , she looked not unlike a hen searching the icy ground for seed . Because there was no one else to share the spectacle with , Heinz Taffel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honked his mirth out toward Irma herself , his breath rising in swirls of mist through the cold , northp120German air . She stopped to look at him , at the same time trying to uncurl her frozen fingers and blow on them as though his amusement gave her leave to rest for a moment ; and when he shouted at her , " Du bist wie ein Huhn ! " so that she might share the joke , she did something in a moment of agonized madness that undoubtedly saved her life in the long months to come . So emaciated that she could encircle the upper part of her arms with her thumb and forefinger , she stood there in the snow and suddenly started to flap her elbows up and down and cackle  --  a raucous , falsettoclucking like a peal of broken bells  --  and before she could tell what he had in store for her , Heinz Taffel had rushed out and , throwing his arms about her in uproarious embrace , half carried , half dragged her , still clucking , back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had laid an egg , he told her , and must hatch it by the warmth of the fire . Dark-haired and dark-eyed with two little patches of red high on his cheeks like a doll , Heinz Taffel had the smell of life about him in a world of death , and even among the prisoners it won him a measure of wary popularity . He would always let them see him coming : he would leap and wave his arms , roaring like a young bull at their ragged clumsiness , kicking and thumping the laggards , but even his brutality was endurable not because it was any less brutal than the others ' but because , though swift and terrible , it had a kind of boy 's passion to it and was quickly spent . Among the officers as well as the other guards he en/joyed what seemed almost a madman 's license  --  on one of the rare occasions when the commandant himselfinspected some of the prisoners ' huts , and Taffel , more than half drunk , had wept like a child when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before had been flogged to death for attempting to escape , nothing had been done about it  --  and there were severalrumors advanced to explain it . Some held that no one dared thwart him because he was a bastard of Rudolf Hess , whom he dimly resembled ; others , that the commandant , who was said to have a taste for boys , had taken a fancy to him ; but whatever the truth of the matter , his exuberance and wild inanities were tolerated to an extraordinary degree , and no one made a move to check him when he seized upon Irma Reinwasser and made her a kind of mascot . He managed to have her taken out of the labor battalion altogether and assigned to orderly duties in the non-commissioned officers ' quarters , where as the hen of Taffel , finally Taffelshuhn , she came to experienceall the hazards as well as the privileges of being their creature . They coddled her with cigarettes and chocolate when things went well , knocked and slapped her around when things went badly , mocked her skeletal ugliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , a barnyard lust for her , and they never let her forget that original act of genius when she had cackled for Taffel in the snow . She crowed for them like a cock at reveille , flapping her hands with their great knobs of wrist and knuckle ,  |p122and  on all fours scratched across the barracks floor for the scraps that they occasionally brought her back from their mess . In their latrine , where a majorpart of her duties took place , they would menace and taunt her with their nakedness , making her dry them after their showers , massage them , and for a period it became the fad to make her lay eggs there , forcing her to relieve herself in front of groups of them in their S.S. uniforms , clucking and grunting with her great bony face somehow detached from the rest of her as it jounced up and down at odd angles like the plaster heads carried on poles in fasching parades . But as the camp went , it was little enough to pay for life and warmth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutal extravagances of his brothers-in-arms and the envy of the other prisoners . But she learned that she could not depend upon him entirely . Sometimes when he had been drinking or when for some other reason his eyes glittered with crazy zest , he would bedevil her with the rest of them , leading them into still greater ingenuities , and nothing was as full of terror for her as this , when the face of the savior became the simpering face of a clown . But afterwards he was always penitent . Once when they found themselves alone by the coal bin where Taffelshuhn sat all streaked with black like a gnome but with some strange , gnarled gentleness in the glance that she raised to him , he had buried his head in her lap , vilifying himself to her unmercifully ,  |p123and  although she did not quite dare to speak , not knowing with which of his faces he might look up at her if she acknowledged his guilt by forgiving it , she had risked laying her stiff fingers on the back of his neck and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching footsteps he had leapt up with his eyes bloodshot and helpless and cursed her superbly . None of this was known , of course , to Will Poteat when he arrived at the house on Congress Street the evening of Nicolet 's telephone call from Muscadine , , but it was more as Taffelshuhn than as Reinwasser that she opened the door for him , her features heavy with shadow from the overhead light . It was Nicolet 's call that had done it  --  her defender and tormentorclownwho had abandoned her only to announce his return to her , Til Eulenspiegel , calling her his own true love , and suddenly it was Taffel whom she heard , their gay voices , gay , dark faces , merging so that she could hardly hold the telephone but handed it to Lizzie and hobbled up the stairs to her room , like a bird with broken wings to stand there by the window as still as death until the children had come up with ice cream on their faces and stared her into action . " You do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of Nick 's . " In her dreams the barbed wire sometimes flowered like a hedge of roses that stretched with wonderful straightness as far as the eye could see , but she couldp124never follow it accurately because something always loomed to frighten her off her course ; yet now , trailingthe fingers of one hand along the wall to mark the clean line of her passage , she led him straight as geometryto the end of the hall where she paused to let him precede her in making the right angle into Nicolet'sstudy , their footsteps clattering through the empty house , the children asleep in their beds . " People tell their secrets here , do n't they ? " Poteat seated himself at the roll-top desk . " They speak of the odor of sanctity , but in a long life of sniffing I have never detected it once . This room , on the other hand  --  it smells of secrecy . " Of course , it was supposed to begin this way , Irma knew . The interrogator made some bland remarksthat left a stain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kleine Taffelshuhn . Wir wollen nur dass man uns die Wahrheit sagt.  --  perhaps he offeredyou a cigarette , lit one himself , and together you watched the smoke curl and tremble . The swivel chair creaked as Poteat tilted back in it with Nicolet 's woodblock of the prodigal son above his head  --  the prodigal bent and exhausted with his face pressed against the old man 's shoulders . Poteat said nothing ; there was a trace of Goering , she thought , in the fixed , encouraging smile  --  unser Hermann with his eyes slightly protuberant as she waited for him to smash his fist down on the desk-top and with flakes of saliva at the corners of his mouth to begin whatever he had come for.  | " There 's a staleness about it , " he said , " that gives it away  --  like an old ice-chest or a closet . They come in here to babble out their sins , and old Nick sits where I 'm sitting , I suppose , rinsing them off with the blood of the lamb . We all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrel with that . I 'm not really a quarreller at all , Fraulein . I 'm a sniffer . " She had known a cross-eyed little undertaker from Mainz who had been dragged back from such an interview with all the fingernails of one hand missing and his face ever after a perpetual mask of astonishmentbecause all that they had talked to him about , as far as he could remember , was the weather  --  doors had kept slamming , he said , and someone had held him by the ears . She had heard that at Sachsenhausenwhen a woman 's labor began , they tied her thighs together . Torture was a beast 's game , and there were beasts everywhere ; no wonder that they had found her out here , deserted by Nicolet . She half expected him to burst out of the closet now where he had been hiding , posturing and gawking as he called her his own true love , Heinz Taffel , handsome and drunk with leather hands . But Irma had stared down darkness before , addressing herself fiercely at her dresser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of doll-size Indian moccasins , and a rabbit 's foot of red , white and blue . Sometimesjust the incantation Amerika , Amerika , was enough to save her although now she leaned forward and massaged her feet , enormous in their sheepskinp126slippers and gym socks , using that familiar pain to chin herself up out of shadow . " What is the matter ? Your feet hurt ? " he asked . " They hurt enough , " and the sound of her voice speaking English was a platform for her to pull herselfup to like an acrobat . " Wass  --  " She frowned at her error . " What 's hurting you ? " " I 'm not in pain , " Poteat said . " I wo n't pretend I have n't sinned myself , such sins as come an old dog 's way . I wo n't pretend there is n't some residual discomfort , a little throbbing of regret whenever the wind blows off the sea  --  not that I regret committing them but that there have been so few occasions to commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own behalf . I 've come in Nick 's . " " Right now , " Irma said , " he 's not here . " " That 's true , of course . " He brought his fist down on the desk-top but soft as a dead leaf , rustling it back and forth over the blotter as he spoke . " He was n't here today , and he was n't here yesterday . It 's a strange business , Miss Reinwasser , but I have a theoryabout it . I 'll bet he 's been taken up , like Elijah . " Poteat tipped back in the chair and looked up at the ceiling . " I can see it clear as day . The sky 's thick with angels and pink clouds , and plunk in the middle is the jolly saint soaring heavenward like a rocket . He 's got his eyes rolled up in prayer and that black nightshirthe preaches in billowed out all around him by the winds of paradise , and his little black toes pointed down . . . "  |p127Irma  sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the effort to remember who he was , but the time for asking him had passed . It was his room now , and she was the one to answer questions ; someone would come up from behind her soon and grab her by the ears . " But unfortunately , there are always the people who live on dung , " Poteat said . " They try to tell me that Elijah 's flaming chariot is really hydromatic and flaming red . That it 's a station wagon he made his getaway in , and maybe not all by his lonesome either . By God , you know , this world 's an ugly place . " " Every week they put your picture in . . . " Sometimesin dreams when the beasts were almost upon you , the best you could do was turn on them and call them beasts , howl it out at them like a beast yourself . If sometimes it only crazed them further as they panted and slobbered toward you down the barricade of roses , sometimes it made them vanish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want to see the news put straight , " Poteat said . " There are rumors all over town about where your man 's gone , and why he went , and who went with him maybe . I 'll tell you one thing for sure . The truth ca n't smell any higher than the rumors do . " " My man ? " She leaned back in the straight chair , . the mended sweater hanging loose from her shoulders and her great slippered feet hardly touching the floor . " My man . . . " By right not of possession but of protection he was hers perhaps : as a foot is the shoe'sp128that it wears , as in some curious way Heinz Taffel had been hers whom she had protected from finally brutalizing her by refusing ever quite to be brutalized , not even at the last with her body fouled with sweat and the cackling pain . Now Nicolet  --  with the shadow of a smile , she prepared to protect him too against this figure who sat at the desk speaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own man , God 's man . You do n't hurt such a man with crazy rumors . " " Some of them say there 's a lady involved . " " Here is a lady . Komm . " She held out both hands , and Lizzie , who had appeared in her nightdress at the door behind Poteat , came padding across the floor barefoot to where Irma sat . " Sleepy lady , " Irma said , taking the small face between her hands and tipping it up to her , then letting it sink to her lap where she covered it with her hands . " The lady you mean is Mrs. Rooney Vail , I 'm not so dumb . " She spoke in a voice emboldened by the presence of the child . " If you want to know more , I will tell you also the rest . I talked to him tonight , and she is with him now , this lady Mrs. Rooney Vail . " Lizzie murmured beneath her hands . " I want a glass of water . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rooney  --  there 's witchcraft in a name like that . It could turn a man to stone . But this beautiful story you 've told me , Fraulein . " His smile deepened . " How am I going to thank you for it . " " It 's nothing like how you think , Mister . " Irmap129picked Lizzie up and set her on her lap . Wrinkles from the bedclothes were imprinted on the sleepflushedface , and putting her thumb in her mouth , she buried her face against Irma 's chest . " Do n't you want to put her back where she belongs ? " Poteat leaned forward and drew his finger lightly across the sole of Lizzie 's foot . She drew it back . The weight of the child felt heavy against her , the slightly sour smell of a child with the wet thumb slipping from her mouth as she fell asleep . Irma shook her head . " She 's all right . She 's sleeping . " Like Goering , he had dimples , would look almost handsome in a uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer his . She could see that the irrelevance there of Lizzie had set his face faltering for an expression that would accommodate both what he had come for and a sleeping child . Once before she had been saved by irrelevance : fat old Maxi wandering in with his snout to the floor just as Taffel had bent down to her again . " The young buck vicar and the gentle-eyed doe have taken to the woods , and their white rumps are seen flashing through the brush . I 'm not a villain , Miss Rainwater . A villain rejoices when the guilty secretis revealed . I mourn . The prize has turned to ashes in my hands . " " Now you must listen to me , " Irma Reinwasser said , " newspaper man , whoever you are . " She spoke without raising her voice but her face snapped like ap130flag . " All this dung you call it , for weeks I 've been getting it everywhere I go , taxi drivers , waitresses , even the milk man . Always the same question  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspaper you keep the fire hot . Why do you do this ? Nothing is going on , that 's the answer . Nothing . They do n't leave here together like crooks . He leaves by himself in the morning early , writing a note for me and kissing the children goodbye . That sounds like Don Juan ? He left this house like a pastor because she wanted him , I do n't know what kind of trouble , and he went away to help her and bring her back  --  tomorrow they come  --  because he called me up and told me this . He is a good man , " she said , " God 's man  --  none of this dirtiness on him . I know it . I live in this house and see him come back tired and sick from his work . He does n't eat good , he 's so skinny . This is the news for your newspaper , write it . In Myron there is a good man doing his work . " Poteat swung around in his chair so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his own hands that lay palms down on the blotter . " Do you believe all that ? " he asked . " I should be saying it if I did n't believe it ? Who is he I should make up lies for him ? " Poteat shrugged . " You say a good man . Maybe so . If he really is , I admit it could explain pretty near the whole damn thing . " He tapped his fingers lightly together in front of his face , staring at her over them again . " I 'll tell you something about goodness , Frau/lein Reinwasser . It brings out the worst in us all . Everytime the world sees too much goodness , it secretly lets loose in its pants . " " What are you saying ? " She grimaced , her small eyes wary . " You see a good man , and deep in your large intestineyou yearn to cut him down to size , your own size . You and I know the world , Fraulein . If he is really what you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think the red-head picked him out except to muck that goodness up a little ? If I may make so bold , " he said , lowering his hands and resting them on the arms of the chair , " why else do you think you were so quick just now to tell me all about it ? I did n't even have to twist your arm . " " You would twist my arm ? " She paused . " I told you he went to her because she is one of his people , to help her out someway . I told you the truth to keep him safe from the filth people think . " Her words came slow as if she was reading them , her lips touching the child 's hair . " Just the way I came here tonight so I could vindicatehim in the public press ? " " You told me you were his friend . " " When all this gets spread around and ploughedunder , I may be the only friend he has . " Poteat gotup from his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You better put her back to bed . " " You really think I want to hurt him ? " She did notrise , and Poteat stood there for a few moments , look/ing down at her . " Why not ? " he said . " It 's the kind of pleasure that 's very hard to resist . " Then he left her sitting there to walk alone down the dark hall and let himself out into the moonlight . They had decided that she did not have the proper kind of feet for a chicken . They could none of them remember how many toes a chicken had except that they were fewer than Taffelshuhn 's , and while a chicken'stoes were long and skinny , Taffelshuhn 's were cramped together and short . A group of guards had discovered this in the barracks where they had been lounging on their bunks after the evening mess idly watching her with her feet bare and her trousers rolled up to the swollen knobs of her knees as she scrubbed down the floor with a pail of soapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surrender in North Africa of the last German units there , and there had been long , grim conversations all that week and considerable drinking so that once the new joke about Taffelshuhn began , it gathered momentumquickly . To crown it , they searched for Taffelin order to confront him publicly with the deficiencyof his hen , and they found him at last in a storeroom behind the barracks where he was on his hands and knees , quite drunk , trying to pry open a wooden crate which he thought contained champagne for the officers ' mess . They had brought Irma Reinwasserwith them , and while two of them held her under the arms , another picked up her feet to showp133them to Taffel so that she was suspended there like a doll making no move to break way or to protest but only keeping her eyes fixed on Taffel to see what he meant to do . In his gloved hand he was holding the pliers with which he had been trying to pull nails out of the crate when the group had entered , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toes just firmly enough to be able to move them back and forth gently , like a doctor . He acknowledged that they were no ordinary chicken feet , but then he swore that she was no ordinary chicken , his Taffelshuhn , and with the patches of red on his cheeks fresh as a girl 's , his lips moist and smiling , he laughed his honking laugh as if to bring the scene to an end , and one or two of the men had already turned to leave when suddenly , with a quick clenching of his leather fist , he had crushed the pliers shut upon her . By lamplightthen with a spring rain falling on the tar-paper roof and the storeroom smelling of the green wood of the crates and Taffel 's laden breath , the operation somehow to give her the feet of a chicken had begun as the men pressed close to watch Taffel with the sweat dropping off the end of his nose and the whimperingshape that he bent to , astride her knees , until from nowhere the Commandant 's old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dazed and grunting face and wagging his rat 's tail slowly from side to side . Taffel stopped as soon as he saw him , an obese old dog with the lining of his eyes showing red and hisp134privates just clearing the floor as he stood there swaying back and forth feebly with the movement of his tail ; and stumbling forward on his knees , Taffel gatheredhim up in his arms , pressed his glistening cheek against him , and then was sick violently and for a long time with old Maxi struggling to get free . His fellow guards had disappeared when he recovered . Only Irma was left , dead he thought at first with her arms and legs sprawled awkwardly as if she had fallen from a great height , but he found her eyes alive and bent his face to them : Verzeihung , Tafelshuhn . Verzeihung , Verzeihung  --  the same word overand over again , at first a supplication but gradually a kind of lullaby  --  forgive , forgive  --  as though he was coaxing a child to sleep . With one hand he brushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her up in his arms like a child and carried her out into the rain with her ruined feet flopping at his side . Irma Reinwasser rose now from her chair with Lizzie and carried her back upstairs to bed without waking her . The room was drenched with moonlight , and a breeze stirred the curtains . She pulled the sheet up over Cornelia and watched her there for a while , unwilling to leave the only room in the house where there was life . By the window stood a carrousel horse that Franny had found and painted snow-white with a scarlet mane and tail , its bridle studded with bits of colored glass that glinted in the moonlight . Irma Reinwasser mounted it and looked down through the window at the shadows of the catalpap135tree on the sidewalk across the street . She wanted to hurt him , the newspaper man had said ; but to hurt which one , Heinz Taffel or Nicolet ? She tried to peel the two faces apart , but they remainedone : savior betrayer , gentle torturer  --  did God himself have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that studied her now through the dark of the children 's room . She raised one hand to her cheek . Nicolet , what had he done after all that she should hurt him  --  had just left her to watch over his children while he stole off at dawn to another woman 's rescue , and why not , with herself only the remains of a chicken woman and not now in need of rescue , not that he knew ; had just for a moment mocked her with the gay , dark words that filled her still with what she could see only as their emptiness : my own true love . The newspaper man was wrong . She had no wish to hurt Nicolet , her man , not even , through him , somehow to hurt Heinz Taffel , hurt back God , the world , for hurting her . Verzeihung , Verzeihung , Taffelshuhn . There was hurt enough . She gripped the reins tight at a murmur from Cornelia , who rolled over on her side with one hand like a starfish on her pillow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about angels , the father said ; Lizzie said little and black like flies , and that was always the joke of it until now with Poteat 's words in her head they became the swarming mat of flies on the dung-heap world . Her hand still at her cheek , forgotten , she looked up at the moon with thep136light of it bathing her great face . There , perhaps , there was cleanness , cold purity of line . Here all was shapeless , random . She had told the truth about RooneyVail to save him , and it had only given his enemy the means to destroy him as perhaps she had wishedall along . Wie man 's macht ist 's falsch , falsch . Andfierce as a gypsy with a sword between her teeth , she spurred her charger on into darkness.  |p137IT  WAS still early morning , but the sun was hot , no movement of air , and they had been standing in the driveway saying goodbye when Rooney had suddenly leaned against the car and let escape the laughter that all through breakfast she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look ! " and their frail attempts to laugh with her had made it only worse until she could feel the tears warm in her eyes : Nicolet in his shirtsleeves and baggy pants with a day 's growth of beard because there was no razor in the house , Lillian Flagg with a blue kimono over her nightdress and lipstick on her teeth  --  " A madam , the village idiot . . . " She let her overnight case drop to the ground with part of a pink slip protruding . " Orphan Annie . " Then Lillian Flagg had taken each of them by the hand so that they stood there in a row , and tiltingher face upward with her eyes tight closed , she had breathed deeply several times like a swimmer about to dive : " Lord , Lord , surround them with yourp138love like a cloud so that no harm can come . . . . to them or from them . " She had raised their hands in hers to shoulder height so that the nightdress was hiked to bare her white shins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are freaks , but we are your freaks . Fill them with life , yea and to overflowing . Even now , Lord , pour it out upon them . Oh yes , thank you , Jesus , even now . It will be so . It will be so . " The great plumes of cloud slowly arched and scattered , and she held their hands so tightly that her arms trembled , then brought them down again and releasedthem . " Thank you , Jesus . " She blinked her eyes open . " From here on out , you do your own praying . " Was it true , was there anywhere such power ? Almostas soon as the house was out of sight , Rooney had turned to him with this only to find him so intent on what in the next instant he began to say to her that he had apparently not even heard her question . He was not going back with her to Myron , he had told her . His father lived only a few hours farther north , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Myron the next day . Would she explain this to Irma and the children as soon as she got back ? Would she call the church ? Did she have money enough to lend him what he would need for the journey ?  --  thislast as she drew up to the curb in Muscadineto let him out , handing him through the window what she had in her wallet which he took and kissed before thrusting it into his pocket . Then he had hesitated for a moment , bendingp139down to look in at her , and she felt that she saw in his face not only all that had happened between them in Muscadine but all that had not happened between them , and she felt that he saw it too and was looking at it now rather than at her , was saying goodbye not to this time that was , but to whatever lay just the other side of time that now would not be . The next moment he had gone  --  in the mirror she saw his narrow , dark figure retreating quickly down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her less that he had gone than that he had never really come , at least not the Nicolet whom she had dreamed that she was summoning with her postcard : part priest , part lover , with whom in a single act she could find both escape and forgiveness for escaping . Before she lost sight of him altogether , she had come close to running after him , and with part of herself she did this as she drove away , overtook him there on the blinding sidewalk and went on with him to wherever he was going and beyond so that in the end it was a vision of them both that she had left in Muscadine . She had driven too fast with all the windows wide open and her hair flying and had felt a recklessness too in being for the first time in her life entirely withoutmoney because she had given all that she had to Nicko and had none left for lunch , nothing , not even for gasoline with the gauge running low . The faster she drove , she believed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether ; the faster she drove , she came half to believe , the betterp140her chance of reaching Myron before she herself ran out altogether . Part of her had gone chasing after Nicko  --  where would they be by now , she wondered , what would he be saying as he turned to her with his turquoise eyes , unshaven jaws of a tramp , and the thin , priest 's hands ?  --  part of her had been diminished by being named , the memory of the window 's crimsonburning and the drowning face that she had pulled down to hers , by Nicko 's saying with a stranger'svoice , Forgive you every face you can not look upon with joy . The air roared through the window , billowing her skirt , as the red car raced , and she tilted her head for the wind to whip the hair from her eyes . She felt light-headed , giddy and bled , and everything seemed to depend upon her getting back to Clem while what there was left of her lasted . It was Clem 's face that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of the gauge . He was not there . She had stopped first at the Something Shop , rapping at the glass of the locked door and peering into the dark interior before she noticedthe Help Wanted placard , which became suddenlyher heraldry as well as his : searching for his life in order to become herself a life . She ran back to her car with her heart drumming out the fear that she had come too late , that Clem had waited there for her with his need emblazoned on the door for all the ages of her absence until finally he had moved on in despairand they were destined now to spend their livesp141searching for each other , missing each other by secondsat each accustomed place . It made reality of all the dreams that she had ever had of separation  --  standing on the deck of a ship as it pulled away from the shore where all the faces were gathered to wave her goodbye , goodbye , through the widening dusk  --  and it was with dread that she drove on to their house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Letters like dead leaves lay on the carpet just inside the front door , and a raincoat hung from the banister with its empty sleeves touching the bottom stair . She ran from room to room , calling his name in a voice that reassured her where the house itself failed . His pajamas lay in a heap by their unmade bed , beside them the crumpled ball of a handkerchief . The floor was stained milky white where rain had blown in through the open window , and she paused there to stare out at the pasture where the old Morgan was rubbing her hindquarters against a tree . The air that rose to her was warm and sweet with grass , and she watched a starling light on the sky-blue salt lick . Beyondthe pasture , a path sloped sharply to where they had dammed the stream for a place to swim ; and not suddenly but as though for some time her eyes had been watching what only now her mind began to grasp , she saw Clem standing toward the top of the path with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the window that she haunted . The water still glistened on him from his swim , a towel about hisp142waist , and unable for the moment to call to him , she waved from her window . At first uncertainly then quick and high , he raised his arm . " My old Clemmy , Clem . . . " nothing more , only Clem rushing to her half naked up the flight of stairs where she stood with her face between her hands , but she had seen him as a warrior , a young archangel drenched in light as he had saluted her from below , and she clung now to a hero 's chill flesh , burying her face between the great wings , the wet , soft feathers of his chest . " Where the hell have you been ? " He held her off at arm 's length , his voice fierce but hushed with the fear that the fault had somehow been his . " Everything'sbeen haywire here . " " The rain came in all over the floor . " The same rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bay window when she had felt a rustling of life , felt now the trembling of his hand on her shoulder so that she bent forward and touched it with her cheek . " Who cares about the rain . . . Clem , I 'm so sorry . My old Clem . . . " " I thought maybe I 'd never see you again . I I could n't believe it except . . . I believed it . I thought you 'd gone for good , and I thought Nick was mixed up with it . They said he 'd taken off too . " He half whispered , his forehead wrinkled as though trying to make sense of his own words . " Was he . . . Nick ? " " He only came to bring me back , but I was alwaysp143coming back . All the time I was  --  " " I never thought you would , " he said . " Everything was haywire there too . This queer little place called Muscadine . " The name sounded to her as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods . There 's a woman who prays for people . They say she 's worked miracles . God knows what Nick thought , lipstick on her teeth . She teaches you how topray . " " How to pray ? " " It 's crazy , is n't it ? " " I do n't know . The world 's crazy . " He still held her there with his wet hands . " That 's why you went  --  just to learn how to pray ? " She nodded . " What did you pray for ? " he said . Drops of water ran down his neck onto his bare shoulder where she touched them . " A baby . " " Oh Christ , Rooney . . . " " Do n't cry , I could n't stand it ! " " I 'm just freezing to death . " He was shivering . " I 'm sopping wet , that 's all . " He took the towel from around his waist and buried his face in it , rubbing his head as hard as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his smile when he looked up at her again , his face flushed from the rubbing , his short hair standing upright . " I better not hang around here bare-ass . " In Muscadine there had been only faces  --  Nicolet 's , Lillian Flagg 's , searched , searching , and all the facesp144that she had remembered in Muscadine , her own ; she had forgotten bodies , calf and thigh , hips squared to support the earth if need arose , and she saw his nakedness as if for the first time . Then with a yelp of mock horror he clapped the towel around himself again to hide the stirring , secret life  --  " I 'm a damned satyr , a goat ! "  --  and with a boy 's hoot stalked off toward their bedroom . Suddenly he turned in the doorway , grim-eyed , wings spread . She fled to him , terrified . The noon sun glanced white from the sheets , and she laughed into his throat as the sunlight pelted her like rain , the dandelion eyes and ragged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , warm beneath the chill . The wantonness of it at noon with all the summer world at work and in the hot street faces meeting , merging without joy like raindrops while with the furious young angel she mounted higher , deeper , until with a shudder the blue air burst and they fell , an amen of exhausted wings . " I prayed for life . Are you life ? " " The answer to a maiden 's prayer . . . goat-foot . " " You 're killing me . . . " and they continued to fall , now side by side on their backs , until they reached earth and earth fell . " She did but see him passing by , " his lips barely moved , face flattened by sunlight on its side close to her . She touched . " Oh God , Clem . . . stupid , lovely stupid , stupid . . . "  | " Lovely . " His eye was dead fire . " Yet she will love him till he die . " " Always now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her hand went stiff . " Come up and join us . The Vails at home . " They listened together to the silence . She said , " Peace . " " Spell it . " " Both ways . " She rose on one elbow and looked down at him . " I 've had it with somebody else  --  a long time ago . " Her mouth trembled at the ease . " I knew . " " How did you ? " " God knows . Was it Nick ? " She shook her head . " Have you too , ever ? " " Only with myself . " " You mean that awful time for the hospital . " " No . " He took her wrist between his fingers . " More since . " Tears came . " Why ? " " Maybe for spite . " He turned his head on the pillowso that he looked up at her , slow and dreaming . " Maybe loneliness . " " Oh , I know , I know , " and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wept . With her mouth wide open and her eyes streaming , she sobbed until her face was covered with pink blotches as Rooney knelt in the grass top146comfort her . Clem and Irma stood by the lilac bush watching , Clem holding two balloons attached to sticks and Irma in a cap with a transparent visor that tinted the upper part of her face green . " You see , that 's because she misses him very , very much . " Cornelia shook her head slowly from side to side , her hair skinned back into two little tufts fastenedwith elastic bands . " He told us he was coming home today . " They had come across the lawn like some strange deputation , Clem with the balloons , Rooney just behind him in yellow slacks with her arms stretched out toward the children as though the message from Nicolet was an offering that she carried . If at first it had seemed to her easy enough to tell them that their father would not be back for another day , at the sight of their two heads springing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curb in front of their house , she had understood quickly that it would not be so . Totally unmoving , they had watched her advancewith Clem across the grass , Irma looking up with them from where she sat with her mending on the back porch , and it had seemed to Rooney as if the summer itself held its breath until finally she reached them and set them in motion with her words . Irma came down the porch steps , Cornelia climbed out of the sandbox to shake her head at her sister 's tears , and Clem stood by the lilac bush with the balloons  --  " Hey , you kids , these are for you . He 'll only be gone one more day . "  --  while Rooney pressed herp147cheek to Lizzie 's hot , hopeless face . " He just thought he 'd go see your grandpa , poor old guy all alone up there . " Only one more day , she thought , except that for a child each day was the only day . " Only one more day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last who quieted her . She lifted her out of the box by the hands and swung her around in a circle as she half chanted , like part of a children'sgame , " Nun kommt er nimmer and nimmermehr . " " No , morgen , " Clem said . " He 's coming morgen . " " Ja , ja ? " Setting Lizzie down on the ground again , Irma gave her a pat on the back that sent her running off with Cornelia to the other side of the lawn where Clem followed them with the balloons . They took them from him and waved them in the air as he pushed them in their swings . " You think he is ever coming back ? " Irma asked . Watching Clem with the children across the wide stretch of green grass , Rooney had forgotten Irma 's presence but turned to her at this , the short figure at her side with her gray hair frizzed out under the baseballcap . She had spoken in a new voice , lower pitched , almost a whisper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes . Rooney 's impulsewas to take her by the hand and run with her back to the children , to talk to her only there in the sunlight with Clem beside them , but in her frayed sneakers Irma stood immovable as stone . " He was all set to come back with me this morn/ing , but then he thought he 'd see his father and come back alone tomorrow . " " It 's going to look better that way , nicht ? " " I 'm sure he never thought of that . " " Then maybe you thought of it . You take him away and you tell him when to come home . Now maybe someday you 'll decide to take him away for good , how should I know ? " One red , one blue , the balloons bobbed in the sun as the children swung back and forth with Clem to push them , and suddenly they seemed so far away that if she cried out to them , they could never hear her . Like the bad fairy at the christening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rooney thought , was her own  --  a life anointed and named : Lillian Flagg with her arms raised to the sky , Clem now . She looked down into the dwarf face . " You already got a nice man only you ca n't get a baby with him . So you try another . " The little eyes tried to hold steady . High in the air , the children screamed . " I do n't even know who you are . . " Rooney found herself whispering ; it was like a shipwreck in sight of land . " Eine Jiidin . . . niemand . Nobody , " she said . " The mud on his boots . " " Oh God , no ! " Irma teetered for a moment  --  " Pfui , p f ui . . . " brushing her face clumsily with her hand as though she were dizzy , knocking her cap askew . " I think I 'm sick . "  |p149Rooney  led her to the porch with her hands on her bony shoulders as she wobbled along , slew-footed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it away and helped her sit down on the steps . " Just get this straight  --  he could n't possibly get along without you . You just came in and took right over . The kids adore you . " " Do n't listen to anything I said . I do n't even believe it myself . I must be crazy . " She leaned back against the railing , pale and out of breath . " Never mind , never mind . People say things  --  God knows what 's true . " " Here everybody 's treated me so good always . Bluebeardsaid such kind things yesterday on the phone . . . " " He 's a kind man . " " Rooney , help ! " Brandishing their balloons , they were chasing him toward the fence , and he leapt like a dancer as he called out , then disappeared with them around the front of the house . " Last night a man came asking questions , " Irma Reinwasser said , " and I told him the two of you were away together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Surround them with your love like a cloud , she remembered , and as if through a cloud she saw him now , or himself a cloud , drifting out of shape . " What did he say ? " Rooney asked . " He 's going to make trouble . " " Do n't worry . I know him . I 'll go and talk to him . "  | " I 'm so sorry , " Irma said . Rooney had crouched down on the step below her , and Irma leaned forward now as she spoke so that their faces were only inches apart . " Sorry . . . sorry . . . " The words came slow and quiet as she wagged her big head , the breath sour , the skin the color and coarseness of sand , and could it be that Irma Reinwasser loved him , Rooney wondered , loved Nicko  --  could loving be what bound them all , bound every life , stranger to stranger , victor to victim . For a moment she almost said this , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak this deepest secret would be to bring heaven in all its terror crashing down upon them unawares . " Oh do n't be sorry ! For God 's sake . " Tossing the baseball cap into her lap , she jumped up from the step and ran off to find the children and Clem.  |p151HE  CALLED IT the Comet Fire Kindler , andI think of it as a mute but eloquent symbol of his life . You took this cone of stout brown paper  --  I have always treasured this one  --  " leaning forward in his rocker , Roy Nicolet held it out for his son to see , " and you filled it first with little bits of soft coal , then with larger pieces , and you coveredit all with coal tar . To use it was very simple . You merely placed it in your stove in front of the draft , banked it with your ordinary coal , and lit it . It made a quick , hot fire which ignited the coal very well , but in a large fire box . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient . " Through his sheer white sport shirt , the wide collarunbuttoned and laid out flat , the outline of his undershirt was visible , the faint pink of shoulders and upper chest . His thick hair was the white of cotton , and he smelled of talcum powder , his face itself a powdery white and curiously flat as though thep152features had been partly rubbed away by too much handling . The skin beneath his eyes was tinged with brown , scorched . " My father was a quick , hot fire , " he said . " He ignited little and burned out young . " Nicolet took the Comet Fire Kindler from him and placed it beside him on the bed where he sat . " Well , everybody 's fine at home . Pie Face and Lizard Boy are burning bright . " " Lizard Boy ? " His whole face seemed to slip forwardslightly toward the pucker of his mouth . " Lizzie , " Nicolet said . " It 's been Indians for over a year now . Franny was Needle Pin . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see why . We 'll go downstairs bye and bye , and I 'll give you a shave . The velvet touch I 've never lost . " He drew his finger flat down the length of his cheek . " Your poor Frances . A year ago spring I stood with you beside her open grave and thought , The good die young , and those whose  --  ' " At a clatter from outside , he stopped and squinted down from his bedroom window into the dusk . " Tinny damned bike always toppling over where he insists on leaning it . " He reached up and gave the window-shade a little tug and let it snap to the top . " And those whose hearts are dry as summer dust burn to the socket . ' Is there anyone else yet , son ? " Nicolet shook his head . " I am sorry to hear it . You need a wife , Theo . You have let yourself go . I was ashamed just now to have Miss Zimmer see you . " Miss Zimmer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the stairs to Roy and then standing there in the dark hallway to watch the old man come slowly downstairs with both of his arms spread wide and embrace his son , kissing him on the cheek . " How long has it been since you shaved . " " There was no razor where I stayed last night . " " And no luggage . I would not be smart to take in a guest here , Theo , who had no luggage . " " I just decided to come at the last minute  --  a filial impulse . " " You could at least have slipped a razor into a briefcase  --  a toothbrush , a comb , perhaps a clean shirt . . . " " Mail me the list . " Nicolet stood up abruptly as he spoke and extended his hand to his father . " I do n't want to cause you any further embarrassment . " He knew in advance what Roy would do  --  the little catch of breath , eyes suddenly veiled as he tipped up his flat , white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck from above , and Nicolet struck out with what words he could find , revolted by himself . " A toothbrush , a comb . An eyebrow pencil . " Roy reached out and seized Nicolet 's hand in both of his . " Stay , Theo . I have n't been well . I 've had this cold for months because I do n't have the strength to throw it off . " On a small tin tray hooked over the windowsill at his side stood a half empty bottle of brown cough syrup , the sugary spoon , and a ruby glass tumblerp154with the name Roy painted on it in an elaborate , oldfashionedscript . " You would n't leave right off  --  " but it was rather the tumbler that held Nicolet there , Roy 's own ruby glass tumbler with his name on it , something a little special for Roy to remember somebodyby or someplace and given to Roy because he was somebody himself , cherished somewhere , not nobody , at the mercy , Nicolet thought , of his only son , that up-and-coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wondered , say God . " You old cry baby . " Nicolet said it because he had to go just that much farther before he could decently come back . Whoever had given the tumbler could never have dreamed of such a scene  --  what killed him was that maybe Roy had given it to himself  --  or else had given it just because of such dreams : whatever happened , he would always have something with his name on it . " I 'll let you give me that shave if you 're still game . " So they found themselves downstairs in the small back parlor with the old barber chair bolted to the middle of the floor , its footrest a spider 's web of cast iron and upholstered in slippery imitation leather . There was a large mirror hung over the sealed-up fire-place , and on the mantel bottles of hair tonic , witch hazel , two stone marmalade crocks full of combs . The light was poor , and Roy switched on a fluorescent circle directly above the chair that hummed faintly and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roy put on his greenp155and black checked lumberjack shirt before seating him in the chair with a sheet draped around him , then raised the chair and tilted it back , placing a folded towel just beneath his son 's chin . Nicolet closed his eyes to the sound of the floorboards ' creaking as Roy moved to the sink and back , the tocking of the brush in the mug ; felt a hand on his forehead as the tepid lather touched him , soap smell , the soft brush working over his jaws and knob of chin . When he opened his eyes , he found himself staring up at his father 's face , above it the ring of harsh light that cracked and dazzled while delicately , his little finger crooked , he held the razor poised above him with its long blade glistening ; and if nothing else , Nicolet thought , he would offer him his throat to cut because a man could not die more justly than at the hands of his father , at least of this father whom he had journeyed to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no father , but only a shadow , a ghost , who must somehow be exorcised before he could continue on his way unhaunted . He neither flinched nor cried out as the old man took him by the lobe of one ear and came at him with the sharp steel , drawing it rasping and gentle down an inch of cheek from the sideburn . " They call you Bluebeard ? Well . . . " He wiped the razor on the towel , gazing at the face as though the face was all that there was . " When I 'm through , they 'll be calling you Prince Charming . " " Tell me more about Leon . " It was partly the con/versation that you made with an old barber  --  tell me about the weather , the ball game  --  partly a plea for some clue to the mystery of this journey that he had taken to find Rooney only to find that Rooney was no more than a stage on the way . " You 've got him on the brain , do you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time only when we begin to need them . Surprising , " he said , the razor hovering like a bird , " that after all these years you should need a man who died half a century before you were born . Perhaps it is his only immortality , but he would probably have settled for less . " " I registered at a hotel once as Rene Laliberte . What do you make of that ? " " Well , it is a good name to travel by . He made it up when he left his native hearth to fight over here for the black man 's liberty . La liberty , you see . He was a romantic , my poor young dad , and an idealist , but it was one bad joke after another for him all the way through . He was born with a caul which the midwife who attended his mother said showed that his life would be remarkable , but though he was a man of more than common ability , his life was not remark-able . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roy had leaned over him , his face seemed empty of all but the task of barbering , and Nicolet spoke the elegiac formula to bring something to life in it . With the old ladies who were his daughters , his flock ,  |p157most  of what he said on his pastoral visits , chattering , teasing , was to keep them from remembering , keep them from weeping ; but his father now he wanted to weep and remember , his barber now he wanted to hurt into becoming a father to weep with , weep at , more than a ghost . Roy gave a deep cough , pressing the back of his hand to his mouth and turning his head aside , flushed , but the withered flesh beneath his eyes was dust dry still as he turned again to his work . " A Southern sharpshooter got him in the right arm just beneath the shoulder , and they should have amputatedimmediately , but instead they performed an operation called excision to remove the shattered bone , only they did not do it well because years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a pension of eighteen dollars a month from his adopted land . They sent from the place where he died for his broadcloth suit , and as a small boy I placed the studs in his shirt . But the worst of it was the field hospital where they left him because he was too near death for them to move him off behind the lines . I remember him telling it , " he said , pausing there round-shoulderedwith a trickle of perspiration staining his Byroniccollar . " He never lost his French accent though he lost everything else . How for three days he lay there with his wound undressed in that southern June while the rats came out and waited by his bedside . It makes you wonder a little about le bon Dieu . He said it would have seemed like Heaven if only he hadp158been able to raise himself up just enough to let the cool air under his back . " Finishing the shave , Roy sprinkled some lotion into the palm of his hand and rubbed it into Nicolet 's face , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pulling the lever , he snapped the chair back into an upright position so that in the mirror Nicolet could see them both  --  Roy standing beside him with the razor in his hand , his own head jutting dark and unfamiliar out of the white sheet . " There now , you 're a new man . " " That would be nice . " His father 's hands had lulled him , and he felt too drowsy to get up out of the chair as though , for as long as he sat there , he was safe from the necessity of pursuing any newness greater than what the shave had produced , safe in the arms of an old nurse from all his pursuers , from himself , from Harold . He ran his hand over his smooth chin and wondered if Leon had felt any such languor as he lay with his rats beneath the hot canvas , safe from all his dreams but death ; and Roy could be death , he thought , eyes scorched into the crumpled white napkin of his face , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly as he gave the chair a little turn to show him a better view of himself in the mirror . Come live with me and be my love , be my son  --  the dry-eyed old cry baby , shuffling and majesticold ghost who had spent years composing deathbedsummonses to convince himself that he was alive enough to die . " Just hold your horses a few minutes more , Theo , and I 'll trim up that hair a little . " Out ofp159the breast pocket of his lumberjack shirt he drew the scissors snapping and flickering with a life of their own . " You 're not telling me the worst of it , are you ? " Nicolet said . " I mean the scandal that came later , whatever it was  --  the heart break , heart ache . . . " With his father 's own language , he thought , perhaps he could stir him to something . " A noble young stag . . . hunted down to his death . " Roy bent almost double with coughing , staggered across the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midget of a man called Durfee , " he half gasped from the sink where he stood , making harsh , gargling sounds  --  " Durfee "  --  then cleared his throat violently and spat before he returned to the chair , dabbing at his eyes and mouth with a towel . " I do n't have the reserve you need to throw it off . At my age you do n't . " Nicolet nodded as the scissors began their chatteringagain at his ear . " A man diminutive in stature as well as in honesty , " Roy said . " Chief of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing where Leon worked as his assistant duringthe second administration of General Grant . They were great friends at first  --  my father boarded with him and his family in Washington and looked up to him greatly , always eager to believe the best of any man . This was before my birth , of course , but I have seen his picture  --  a dapper little gentleman with a handlebar moustache and a high and scholarly forehead  --  and to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seems . The Bureau was a small empire that occupied an entire wing of the old TreasuryBuilding . There were bookkeepers and engravers , plate printers and machinists , superintendents , clerks , artists . And there were dozens upon dozens of women and girls who did mainly the counting and trimming and calendering of endless sheets of paper from the blank sheets themselves to the completed bank notes and stamps and bond issues of every sort . Over all of these people Mr. Durfee presided , and they were all completely dependent on Mr. Durfee 's good will becauseMr . Durfee 's power was absolute . He could hire and discharge as he saw fit . He was responsible to no one . This was a great many years ago , Theo , but to me it is very real because the last months of his life he spoke of it constantly , and his memories of it were most of my inheritance . There , " Roy said , tipping Nicolet 's head slightly to one side . " Now a little off the top . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departmentsbecause few of the positions required much education and the hours were more strictly kept , but even so the demand for jobs there was considerable , especially among women . Congressmen who wanted to stand well with their constituents or to help some needy widow or orphan or who from some less worthy motive wanted to provide for some female friend would come to Mr. Durfee and ask a place for them . And if the Congressman was insistent , especially if he was a senator who was going to be in Washingtonp161for some years , the place was generally found and the girl would be crowded in even if it meant that some other girl had to lose her place so the payroll would n't look too large . There were some girls who were never seen about the Bureau at all except to pick up their wages , and it was said of them that they did their work at home . But the question was what kind of work was it that they did at home and who did they do it for . You get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicolet and addressing the mirror . " If it was not so tragic , it would be a proper subject for farce . Rene Laliberte  --  although by that time he had long since taken back his proper name  --  this ardent young Frenchman with all his glorious ideals and dreams found out after a few years that he was working in a bordello ! " Behind him , Nicolet could feel the widows and orphanscrowding into the makeshift barber shop with their long dresses rustling as they jostled each other to make room for the little Victorian dwarf himself in his flowered waistcoat . " Break , noble heart . . . " Roy said , his voice unsteady as he raised his comb in the air . He had needed only an audience , Nicolet thought , staring down at the sheet that shrouded him , his face burning , and now he had created one for himself . " In summertime the heat of the place was infernal , and Leon always held that the heat was partly responsiblefor what went on  --  all those women with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their bodies . Mr. Durfee strutting aroundp162among them like a bantam cock . But not all Leon 's dear charity could lay the rest of it at the weather 's door  --  the bribes shamelessly accepted from plate printing companies who wanted Mr. Durfee 's good word in getting contracts . Profiteering , rake-offs of everykind . . . It 's hard to see how he could have remainedignorant of it all as long as he did . Then he wrote a pamphlet , Theo . " He had placed a hand on Nicolet 's forehead to tilt his head up and paused there , holding it so firmly against his chest that Nicolet was forced to meet his father 's stare in the mirror . " He exposed everything , naming names and giving facts . He had it printed up at his own expense and mailed copies to all the important men in Washington at the time . All he thought he had to do was tell the truth , you see , and the world would rise up in indignation and stamp out the evil . Imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with in the war  --  mostly foreigners and roughs  --  they called themselves les enfants perdus , and he was the real perdu , my dad . They crucified him , Theo . It was n't enough to force his resignation from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing . That little whoremaster hounded him through the city until there was n't an office that would have him . He was  --  " Behind them the door opened , and Miss Zimmer entered the room  --  " Ruined , ruined , " Roy said  --  a bony woman with blue hair , squinting through the smoke of the cigarette that trembled between her lips as she spoke . " Sorry to bother you with a customer , Roy , "  |p163she  said , " but somebody 's got to do something about you-know-what . " " It 's not a customer , Miss Zimmer , it 's my son . You let him in yourself . The Reverend Nicolet . " She shook the hand that Nicolet extended from beneath the sheet but otherwise scarcely acknowledged him , giving all of her attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge her as he redoubled his speed with the scissors , every muscle in his face drawn tight . With one eye half closed against the thread of smoke , she watched him keenly , as sensitive as a connoisseur to every refinement of his displeasure and not unappreciative of it or of her own ability to evoke it . " It 's been plugged up since lunch , and the whole upstairs smells like a sewer . " " I 'm not a plumber , Miss Zummer  --  Zimmer , " he corrected himself , still not looking at her but taking a fistful of his son 's hair and shearing off the top . " I 've put in a call to the proper authorities , and they will come when they will come . " He swung around so that he stood between her and his son . " Roy , do n't turn your back when I 'm talking to you . Roy . . . Roy . . . " She put all of him into his name which she repeated insistently but without raisingher voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself knew as his son  --  much of what the ruby tumbler knew of who he had been and most of whoeverhe had become since . " Roy , I 'm speaking to you . Roy . . . " a monotonous , admonitory chant with the old man 's face contracting at each repetition of hisp164name until his features seemed a tight knot at the center . " Is n't there something I can  --  " Nicolet began , when his father suddenly turned and let the scissors drop to the floor . " Yes , Miss Zimmer ! " He spoke with exaggerated politeness . " Would n't you like the Reverend Nicolet to accompany you now to your toilet and see what he can do with it ? I 'm sure it would make his whole trip here seem worthwhile . Oh God . . . " He reached backward to support himself on the arm of the chair . " Roy , you 'll end up burying us all . " Miss Zimmer spoke calmly , dropping her cigarette to the linoleum and stepping on it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had accomplished her purpose . " As for the Reverend . . . " for the first time since entering , she took her eyes from Roy and looked at Nicolet . " It 's too bad he 's not enough of a son to make the trip more than once a year . " As she left , Roy slumped down in a chair by the fireplace , leaning forward with his face hidden in his hands , and Nicolet , the sheet still pinned about him , came over and crouched at his side . " Are you all right ? " As he put his hand on his father 's shoulder , it felt to him like someone else 's shoulder , someone else 's hand . " That damned thing , " Roy Nicolet murmured with his face still hidden . " It 's always getting plugged . I do n't know what she does with it . " " Probably no more than she has to . "  | " You 'd be surprised . " There was a muffled choke that Nicolet took for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . Nicolet could not remember the last time he had seen his father smile , a great sprawl of crooked teeth and shadows that seemed to expand until it embraced not only Miss Zimmer but Leon too , as though he recognized at last that even at Leon you could only laugh as now he did , a slow , helpless shaking of the shoulders , his eyes watering , as he spoke from behind his hand . " She 'll do anything to get a rise out of me . " With his sheet hanging like a cowl , Nicolet rose and returned to the chair where he threw back his head to free one clear laugh of his own : Leon dreaminghis noble dreams among the federal whores , old Roy playing tragedy in a house that smelled like a sewer , and himself , the adventures of Bluebeard . . . He could see Lillian Flagg with her white shins bare as she prayed for him in the driveway , the bored boy listening to his blasphemies as they drove through the rain , the one tear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she had confessed to the act of her loneliness while he , her confessor , aching , had touched with his knuckle only the tear . The world was a bordello  --  the old man must know this , he thought , watching him get up from his chair , still wet-eyed , and bend down for the scissors where he had let them fall , his face dark as the blood ran to his head . Confession and tears , the preacher had said , hunched like a monkey in the high college pulpit andp166plucking the air . And yet at the heart of it , the great laughter  --  not , by some miracle , bitter , broken , but splashing like a fountain and spilling over the sides . Joy , Nicolet , joy , Lillian Flagg had said . Joy , little man , he thought , love-sick , God-sick little man , homesick , and he had taken the girl 's face in his hands to forgive it , Roy 's face appearing now above his own , a totem pole . " After that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scissors flashing once again . " He left Washington and moved to Chicago , married a gentle soul there who died having me  --  a life for a life . The good Lord seems to want there to always be Nicolets , but it 's catch-as-catch-can for us once we appear . Our women die young , Theo . Your mother too . The music boxes did n't sell . Then the fire kindlers . But he had a merry heart . I can still remember songs he taught me . Mademoiselle . . . voulez-vous danser ? " He paused , his mouth slightly open as he searched the dim room . " Non , Monsieur , j'ai mal au pied . " All these things , Theo  --  memories , scraps of foolishsongs . La Fille de Madame Angot , he loved , and Brignole singing the Miserere . I 've carried them down the years the way a snail carries his shell on his back , and maybe that 's why I 've traveled so slowly and covered so little ground . I 've carried his dyingespecially . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dignity , and in some ways my father did that except that like the rest of his life , it was not unmixedwith elements that were not dignified.  | " The bone of his right arm was gone at the shoulderjoint , you see , and he could not lift the arm or stretch it out . When the elbow was supported , he could use his hand , but it had to be supported at just the right height  --  not too high , not too low  --  or he got very tired . When he walked , he usually carried his hand in his trouser pocket , and when he was in a crowd or riding the street car , people often hurt him without knowing it . So finally it got to the point where he went to the examining surgeon at the pension board and begged to have the arm taken off altogether , but the medicos always discouraged him and said it was better than no arm at all . And they also gave him some pills that had morphine in them although I believethat he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years he took them every night , and they helped him . But then the day came when they did not seem to help him so much , and one afternoon he came home from work  --  by then he had a position as bookkeeper in a hardware concern , selling his fire kindlerson the side  --  and went to bed . To a ten-year-old boy , it is a very frightening thing to see a grown man in bed in the middle of the day . You think the world is coming to an end . The next morning he could not get his shirt on , and the pain was so severe he could not stay in bed any longer but walked the floor for hours holding his poor arm in his hand and not able to keep back the groans until finally the woman who cooked for us persuaded him to let us go for a doctor . It was all swollen and inflamed , and you could seep168that something terrible was happening . I remember the cook telling me that if I wore a dime in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die , and for the few days more that he lived , Theo , I wore a dime in my shoe , but it did no good . The doctor had us put flaxseed poultices on the arm  --  I would help wring out the cloths in hot water  --  and this went on for days while he kept on taking larger and larger doses of his pills to ease the pain . Then one morning , we found that a small pimple had formed on the line of the old scar , and it kept on growing until suppertime when it broke and began to discharge . He told us that now he knew an abscess had formed on the bone , and we must take him to the hospital . " As Roy spoke , Nicolet kept trying to see him as the child he had been , Leon 's boy with a dime in his shoe , and to see him through Leon 's eyes , his child grown old , his face a landscape where someplace a child was buried . He remembered Lizzie sitting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle , the slap and sizzle of Irma  --  when suddenlyshe started to run in panic through the boiling foam and he caught her up , chill and shaking , in his arms , and thought that this must be what it was like to be Harold , tried now to look at the old , bluelippedchild through Harold 's eyes . " They took off the arm , " Roy said . " An aunt of my mother 's brought me to see him every day after school , and I would stay with him hours at a time . He could not stand to be alone . He said the rats wouldp169come into his room when I was gone . And sometimes Mr. Durfee would come . Mr. Durfee would climb in through the window and sit on the foot of his bed all night , smoking a cigar and chatting away like old times . Father told me how he said he was sorry for all he had done and asked to be forgiven , and Father forgavehim . There was nobody there , of course . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know till later . " Replacing the scissors and comb in his pocket , he unpinned the sheet and shook it clean . " At night there in the hospital , he would scream and scream until no one on the floor could sleep . And it was not because of the pain , they said , or the rats or Mr. Durfee . Although I could never believe that he knew what those pills contained , over the years he had become so dependent on them that when the doctors tried to take him off them , he went out of his mind . He had become an addict , Theo . It was morphine he screamed for , and a few days later when he finally died , he died whimpering like an animal  --  his arm gone , his wife gone , finally even his dignity . . . " There were several thumps on the ceiling as he paused , but Roy gave no sign of hearing them as he stood there , with the sheet in his hands , his mouth puckered and his cheeks going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Rest . . . rest . . . " he said , pushing the lever so that the chair sank unsteadilyto the floor . " Rest , perturbed spirit . " It had sounded as though someone was moving a piece of furniture across the room above them , butp170now the noise became insistent , a steady , loud rapping . " That 's Zimmer , " Roy said finally , and as he looked up at the ceiling , the smile slowly began to return  --  " She wo n't stop till I go up there and tinker with the damned thing "  --  then froze as Nicolet , half rising from the barber chair , seized him by both arms and suddenly pressed his cheek flat against the old man 's chest like a doctor listening to the beat of a heart.  |p171HE  LAY behind the barn with his jacketfolded under his head . The rim of the sunhad just appeared above his father 's house , and long diagonals of light came slanting down at himfrom the peak of the roof . " The birthday of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he began , histhin lips barely moving . " I 've got this sermon to do . . . " Do n't ham it up , Nick . That 's cheating . " Franny . " He could invoke all of his saints now , he thought , stretching his bare arms out into the dampgrass . Voulez-vous danser ? " Yes , dansez , dansez , Leon . " The drawn sky swarmed , cloudless , beyond the apple branches . A little notebook lay open on his chest . " Pentecost , " he had written . " The fourth Sunday after  --  better late than never . " Then , in parentheses , " Have you ever received the gift of the Spirit , Mr. Nicolet ? ' Saint Lillianthe Less . Non , Madame , j'ai mal au pied . " Besidethe notebook lay a pocket-sized New Testament inp172French , bound in rusty black cloth with part of the spine torn away and inscribed , " Rene Laliberte , Front of Petersburg , August 28 , 1864 . " He had found it on the pillow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in French was like reading it for the first time . He had looked at the last chapter of Luke as he dressed  --  the eleven hiding out somewhere in Jerusalem afterthe crucifixion : " et Jesus lui-meme se presenta au milieu d'eux . . . et it leur dit , Avez-vous ici quelque chose d manger ? ' " " The fraternity brotherwith pimples on his chin knew the answer to that , he had thought . And the boy had been right . That was what the world gave him to eat all right , the disciples no less although on this occasion they had come through with a piece of fish . It was like them to be eating when he appeared  --  scared stiff but with their mouths stuffed full . One of them probably slid a piece of it across the table without daring to raise hiseyes . Then , " Demeurez dans la ville de Jerusalem jusqu 'd ce que vous soyez revetus de vertu d'en haut " Stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high , the promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had stopped on his way to Muscadine , the faces bursting into flame , the sermon . As the sun cleared the roof , the light became almostintolerably clear . Every detail of texture and color seemed too visible , dazzled him ; it was like looking at pebbles through the flashing water of a stream  --  the flakes of rust on the wheel of the ruined cider press , the beaded brilliance of orange rinds that layp173tumbled down the slope of the compost heap . " Yot tell me , old Lillian , bare-shanks , how do I preach thi power from on high ? " Just look around you , Nicolet . Her eyes swelled the chipmunk smile . " I see a tiny red bug crawling up a tree trunk . I se where my tragic old dad dumps the slops . " Call on his name now . " The bug 's ? " The Lord 's . " Oh Lord . . " he began , stopped then . " My pray ers move creepy-crawly like the bug . Help me . " His real name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Makes me think of corr. belt parsons with china teeth and ghastly old Jesus hymns . Beulah Land . Melodeons . " It 's his name . Call upon it . " Later . " There were other saints . He leaned over on one elbow and took the pencil in his hand . " Power , ' he wrote , " from on high , " with a little feathered arrowpointing up . The professor of homiletics had told them always to put into one sentence the central point and never to preach for less than twenty minutes  --  " Sermonettes make Christianettes , " he had said . " It comes down , " Nicolet added . Did it ? He crossed out what he had written and in block letters wrote , " IS IT TRUE ? " Was that , secretly , what they came to find out Sunday after Sunday , just that , yes or no ? He thought of them settling down to silence , old jaws clamped in a look of imbecile concentration , as hep174took his place at the lectern and unfastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they sat  --  the queer old lady hats set square like little mansard roofs , hearing-aids in the front pews , here and there a palm leaf fan flickering and the muted complaint of a cough . Rooney would sit in the back with her hair tucked into a bun getting ready to add up the hymn numbers but not yet . For those few moments before he began to speak , he could believe that they had come for something , were dreaming that maybe this . time he would tell them : IS IT TRUE ? " It 's the awfulquestion you avoid like death , " Rooney had once said in a fury . Like life , some saint said to him now . They waited . You waited . Sometimes you felt as though you had swallowed an anchor , waiting there . May the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in Thy sight . . . . Then " This morning , " he could say , " may the words of my mouth be just this  --  Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He lives . He has power . Can you believe it ? Yes . It comes down . " Hearing-aids would be turned up or off , hat pins trembling jet . " Oh the world 's a great bordello all right , saith the prophet  --  down to the last square inch . ' What 's a minister like me even but God 's pimp , maybe half in love with the flesh he 's peddling but only half ? What 's any one of you ? " What was Rooney , chaste as a nun in black linen , dreaming of a stranger  --  Leon screaming in the night ? " Beloved , do n't believe I preach the best without knowing the worst , that 's all I mean . I know it , be/loved  --  a flop of a son , comedian of a priest . But the worst is n't the last thing about the world . It 's the next to the last thing . The last thing is the best . It 's the power from on high that comes down into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world like a hidden spring . Can you believe it ? The last , best thing is the laughing deep in the hearts of the saints , sometimes our hearts even . Yes . You are terribly loved and forgiven . Yes . You are healed . All is well . " They would file past , shaking his hand . " It was so lovely , so spiritual . . . A fine message . . . You really put it to us that time , Nick . " The cars pulled out slowly onto Congress Street and rolled on toward Sunday lunch , the papers . He flopped his head over on the folded jacket , gazing out into the trees . " Why was beauty ' on your list ? " I ca n't remember . But do n't ham it up , Nick . Never say more than you really feel . " I feel slightly dizzy . . . . " The smile was half agony . He closed his eyes in the warm sunlight . Soon it would all begin  --  breakfast with Roy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Irma , the sermon to write  --  but for as long as he lay there , none of it could touch him . There would be time for all of it , but for the moment he held it all off , time off , and the earth beneath him seemed to tilt this way and that like a great disc . There was the smell of oranges , his arms heavy as stone on the grass . He could hear the buzz of yellow jackets drifting over the compost . Deathp176must come like this . The Reverend Nicolet found behind his father 's boarding house , no sign of struggle , only a picture postcard  --  someone was thinking of him in Muscadine . Only it was not death that was coming , whatever else . His heart pounded , and he did not dare open his eyes not from fear of what he might see but of what he might not see , so sure now , crazily , that if ever it was going to happen , whatever it was that happened  --  joy , Nicolet , joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always in unlikely places : the road to Damascus , Emmaus , Muscadine , stuffy roomfulof frightened Jews smelling of fish . Now , he thought , now , no longer daring not to dare , but opening his eyes to , suddenly , the most superbly humdrumstand of neglected trees with somebody 's shoe in the high grass and a broken ladder leaning , the dappledrot of last year 's leaves . " Please , " he whispered . Still flat on his back , he stretched out his fists as far as they would reach  --  " Please . . . "  --  then opened them , palms up , and held them there as he watched for something , for the air to cleave , fold back like a tent flap , to let a splendorthrough . You prayed to the Christ in the people you knew , the living and the dead : what should you do , who should you be ? And sometimes they told you . But to pray now this other prayer , not knowing what you were asking , only " Please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the leaves were still except for one that fluttered like a bird 's wing . " Please come , " he said , then " Jesus , " swallowing ,  |p177half  blind with the sun in his eyes as he raised his head to look . The air would part like a curtain , and the splendor would not break or bend anything but only fill the empty places between the trees , the trees and the house , between his hands which he brought together now . " Fear not , " he thought . He was not afraid . Nothing was happening except that everything that he could see  --  the shabby barn , weeds , orchard  --  had too much the look of nothing happening , a tense , self-conscious innocence  --  that one startled leaf . He listened for " Feed my sheep . . . feed my lambs . . "  --  the old lambs , faces where children lay buried , Roy with the dime in his shoe ; his children'sfaces , Rooney 's , where the old women they would be lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some young divine with memories of " My father . . . " her eyes blurred behind the heavy lenses . " I believe that once by Grandpa'sbarn he said he saw . . . . " Two apple branches struck against each other with the limber clack of wood on wood . That was all  --  a tick-tock rattle of branches  --  but then a fierce lurch of excitement at what was only daybreak , only the smell of summer coming , only starting back again for home , but oh Jesus , he thought , with a great lump in his throat and a crazy grin , it was an agony of gladnessand beauty falling wild and soft like rain . Just clack-clack , but praise him , he thought . Praise him . Maybe all his journeying , he thought , had been only to bring him here to hear two branches hit each otherp178twice like that , to see nothing cross the threshold but to see the threshold , to hear the dry clack-clack of the world 's tongue at the approach of the approach perhapsof splendor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Someone was calling " Nick oh Nick . . . oh Nick , " and as he watched , wooden-throated , a neat , dark figure appearedaround the corner of his father 's house . " Denbigh ! " It came out an unfamiliar croak and he tried again . " As I live and breathe . " Denbigh did not see him at first but raised his hand to shield his eyes and looked in the wrong directionuntil Nicolet reached for an orange rind and tossed it toward him . Then he came trotting through the high weeds . " Nick , old man ! Your dad said he saw you out here through the window , and there you are . " There was the handsome little flash of a smile as he shook his hand , the steel-rimmed glasses glinting in the sun . His crisp , black suit and the immaculate white of his clerical collar warred with the dilapidated place , but the advantage was all Denbigh 's  --  the place had already grown dim and irrelevant . " There 's nothing wrong with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it always came when you were looking the other way . " Oh Hell no ! " The jaunty little oath was Denbigh 's penance somehow for the collar , Nicolet thought , be , cause Nicolet himself had none , standing there in his shirtsleeves , a renegade . Denbigh reached out and plucked off a damp leaf that hung from Nicolet'sp179shoulder . " They 're in great shape . I talked to Irma on the phone last night . " " Then pull up a chair . Tell me what 's on your mind . " " Do n't mind if I do . " He spread his handkerchief on the ground , and as he sat , the ground became a chair , the trees a manse ; Denbigh would not have heard clack-clack , Nicolet thought , but the Apostles ' Creed . " Irma told me where you were . I thought I 'd hop over and catch you up on the news . " " Well , you 're a breath of sanity , a ring of truth , " Nicolet said . Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see that it was some kind of ordeal for him , his forehead shiny with perspiration . " But she should have saved you the trip . She knows I 'm coming home today . " " Frankly , she does n't really think you 're ever coming home , Nick . I 'm afraid she 's in pretty much of a state . " " Did n't Rooney give her the message ? " Denbigh paused for a moment at Rooney 's name , his eyes suddenly going dull , and for the first time Nicolet realized that he must have gotten up in the middle of the night to be here now . " It 's nothing you ca n't handle , I know . But you 've been gone three days now , old man , and your own church does n't know where you are , so there have been all kinds of rumors , that 's all . " " Such as ? " " Well , it 's what you might expect . The word gotp180around that Rooney Vail was gone too , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back to pack up her stuff and leave for keeps . You 're supposed to be waiting for her somewhere . " Nicolet nodded . He had prayed " Please come , " and it was little Ralph Denbigh who came . " It 's a strange world . " He smiled . " And there 's also this . " From his wallet Denbigh drew a newspaper clipping and held it out to him . " Poteat 's latest . It came out yesterday . " " What 's in it ? " " You better read it , Nick . This is pure poison . " Denbigh watched him tuck it , unread , into his shirt pocket . " Poor old Irma thinks she 's responsible . She says she 's the one who let it slip you and Rooney were together , and now she 's dying a thousand deaths . " " We were together , you know . " " I know . Irma says you came to help her out with something . " Denbigh took off his glasses to wipe the perspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he looked suddenly forlorn . " That 's all there was to it  --  right , Nick ? " " Poor old Denbigh , how many deaths have you been dying ? Yes , " he said . " That 's right as rain . " " Of course it is , " Denbigh said . " So now the thing to do is get you back pronto and slay the beast . That 's why I came . " " Just one thing first . " A rung of the broken ladder lay near Nicolet 's hand , and he picked it up . " I want you to listen to something . Just sit right where youp181are . " Nicolet had risen to his feet and walked over to one of the trees as he spoke . " And listen . " Denbigh hooked his glasses back over his ears and craned around to see what Nicolet was doing . Nicolet took the ladder rung and gave one of the branches two sharp raps . " What 's that supposed to be ? " Denbigh asked . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conductingFranny 's funeral  --  as though it had suddenly come to him that she was not really dead at all and that he was committing the blunder of his career ; as though now his friend had lost his mind and he should be running for help , not sitting there in the weeds listening to him strike a tree . Nicolet struck it again , two blows spaced somewhat farther apart , and looked into Denbigh 's eyes with a kind of half amused intensity . " Could you dance to that ? " he asked . " Dance ? " Denbigh raised one hand , the fingers spread apart , and touched his brow with it , staring at Nicolet through the fingers  --  a small , intelligent animalpeering out of his cage of flesh . " If the life of faith was a dance , Denbigh , and this was the only music  --  all you could hear anyway  --  " with a few more double raps he began to suggest a kind of erratic rhythm "  --  do you think a man could dance it , Denbigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose you could dance to it , " Denbigh said . " I 'm not sure what you 're talking about . "  | " I 'm not sure what I 'm talking about either . " He tossed the rung toward the barn which it struck and fell . " But whatever this is we move around through . . . " He raked his hand slowly back and forth through the air . " Reality . . . the air we breathe . . . this emptiness . . . If you could get hold of it by the cornersomewhere , just slip your fingernail underneath and peel it back enough to find what 's there behind it , I think you 'd be  --  " Roy had appeared on the back porch and cupping his mouth with one hand , called to them through the still morning haze . " Breakfast , " he called . " Breakfast . " His shoulders hunched , he leaned forward on the railing . " I think the dance that must go on back there , " Nicolet began , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where being comes from . . . There 's dancing there , Denbigh . My kids have dreamed it . Emptiness is dancingthere . The angels are dancing . And their feet scatter new worlds like dust . " He raised one arm to show his father that he had heard him , but he did not turn . Some magic in his voice had lulled Denbigh , the frown had gone . He sat there listening as though he could hear the angels himself , the lenses of his glasses afire with the splendor of their wings . " If we saw any more of that dance than we do , it would kill us sure , " Nicolet said . " The glory of it . Clackclackis all a man can bear . " " With two wings they covered their eyes , ' " Denbighsaid , " and with two they covered their feetp183And with two they danced . " " Hoo . . . hoo . . . . " Roy was calling them through his cupped hands . " It 's holy ground , " Nicolet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The whole bloody earth is holy ground . " " Let 's eat . " Denbigh rose to his feet finally , brushingoff his trousers with his handkerchief . " Let 's dance , " Nicolet said . Denbigh tapped the pocket where Nicolet had placed the clipping . " After you 've read that , friend , " he said , " you may not feel like dancing . "  |p184THE  infernal loveliness of a New England spring , " Poteat wrote . " At sunset when the tide is out , the wet sand turns lavender and becomes a looking-glass . In bare feet a woman walks along the water 's edge looking for her lost youth , a gull sits on a rock waiting for the Second Coming . Next week is Independence Day , and summer trembleson the lip of June . " His friend Metzger , who taught English at the MyronHigh School , amused himself by occasionally clippingPoteat 's column out of the newspaper and mailingit back to him corrected in red pencil . He would underline infernal , ' Poteat thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " how come , " or " horse manure " ; but infernal ' was at the heart of what he wanted to say , and infernal ' it would remain . Loveliness was infernal because it only masked inferno , just as living flesh was deadly because it only masked the bones of death ; the temptation was always to fall in love with what inp185the end would destroy you . Anyway , Metzger was an ass , he thought , Squirrel as his students called him ; and once when Metzger had expressed puzzlement over the nickname , Poteat had explained that it was because he looked like a squirrel  --  as simple as that  --  and he did , the busy little grey bachelor face , all whiskers and teeth . You made friends with the ones who in the end would destroy you if only by boring you to death . When he began to write the column that disturbed Denbigh , Poteat did not know how far or where his words would take him . He never knew . The Repositorywas his own paper  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you think people use it for , Willy ? "  --  and answerable to no one , he followed wherever the words led . " Words are my undoing , " he told Metzger one evening over a plate of fried clams at the Old Myron . " My undoing literally , " he said . " My unraveling . Like a golf ball when you take the cover off  --  all those miles and miles of rubbery string . I 've been reeling words out of my gut for years , I supposeto find out one day what there is at the middle of me . " Metzger told him that at the middle there was a little kernel of warm , stale air . " A flock of sanderlings , " Poteat wrote , " tilts through the salt air , furling and unfurling like a scarf . " Or like a handkerchief , he thought . If it had not been for the handkerchief , he might have lost his mind . And even as things stood , who could possibly count his loss ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but late as it was  --  he had just returned from his meeting with Irma Reinwasser in Nicolet 's study  --  he put it aside in order to savor once more the full richness of his longing , his regret , the thick , dark honey of his anger . He switched off the lamp on his desk and sat staring out at the Myron river . From the tall chimney of the shoe factory , a feather of smoke drifted down toward the black water . Rooney had told him to go . She had sat there with one of the green ponchos clutched about her shoulders , and picking up the keys to the shop from the counter , he had let himself out without looking back . The store fronts were ruddy with the setting sun , and he had walked slowly up McKinley Street carrying his secretlike water so holy that it would mean death to spill a single drop . He could remember glancing ahead to where his house stood just beyond the bridge and thinking that once he got there , he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rest of them should suddenly come at him out of one of the shops , he would be in danger of blurting out the whole thing : that he was no longer trapped with them in the airless middle of middle age but that he had been rescued by a pair of young arms and drawn back into something again like youth , only youth as he had never known it , youth as he had never wanted to know it , not even when he was young . From the time of his boyhood , he had yearned to be quickly old . While his contemporaries dreamed of their hearts ' desire , he had dreamed of a time beyondp187desire , of resting secure and dry at last on the other side of the treacherous river . Even in High School he had emulated the manners , the dress , the speech of middle age , and what he had studied was not what was taught but the teachers themselves . His classmatesthrilled to the sight of what was daring , beautiful , wild , but he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Principal , who could sit superbly unthrilledthrough the wildest and most daring that beauty could do on the football field , the dance floor , anywhere . He had learned to be world-weary before he had learned anything very much about the world , and as he walked up McKinley Street , he felt that he had made a nearly fatal mistake with his life and that the strange young woman had saved him in the very nick of time . He dreaded the possibility of meeting Metzger because Metzger would laugh , of course , his squirrel face cracking and chittering  --  grow old along with me , the best can never be  --  and yet he yearned to meet him too , even paused for a few moments in front of Thelma 's grill where Metzger sometimes came for an early supper with his briefcase of papers to correct , because there was also a crazy bravado in him that wanted to boast of the cool and conquering young mouth that he had conquered , to astound the old , grey squirrel who was his friend and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known all his life which had not been a life at all , as he saw it now , but a longing for death . But he met no one on his way , and when he gotp188back to his empty house , he went straight upstairs to his bedroom , opened his closet door where a full-length mirror hung , and stood there in the autumn dusk trying to see the person that Rooney Vail must have seen , trying to smile at himself the same smile that she had touched with her fingers  --  had she ? For only an instant then , but at desperate length later , he doubted the whole thing . He could imagine Metzger 's cackle  --  " My God , Willy ! Do n't you know about the male menopause , the last little fling before the sap stops flowing ? "  --  and as much to Metzger as to Rooney he had parted his lips to speak , had held out one pleading hand toward his own reflection . It was not true ; he was still a young man , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . He could almost have wept at how much it was not true , and just at that moment he thought that he saw who it was that Rooney had taken for a lover  --  this stout , pale , melancholy man , reaching out in shudderingdisbelief for anybody 's hand . She had rescued him . He was deeply moved by his own sad smile . Perhaps in some way he had rescued her . He shut the closet door slowly , no longer even hating Metzger , and when he went to bed  --  he did not undress but lay down on top of the covers fully clothed  --  the chill Octoberair lulled him to sleep like October 's weary but victorious prince . When he woke up , he was sick with love . Dreams that he could not remember had flung open doors that Rooney herself had only unlocked . His life was nop189longer a familiar room but a corridor swept with bright wind that might lead anywhere . He lay on his bed as though he had been drugged , unable to get up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Rooney  --  when he would see her again , what Clem would do , what was to become of them  --  but aware only of the workings of the drug itself . He felt a soft , heavy pain all through him , but he felt too that beneath it , waiting , lay another pain so much greater that if he had to endure it undrugged , it would be the end of him . Once or twice as he lay there , he whispered her name to himself although he could not really remember now what she looked like or the sound of her voice ; and when he did this , he felt stabs of the deeper pain so sharp that for the rest of that first day he did everything that he could to put her out of his mind altogether . The newness and rawness of his love made even the thought of his beloved unendurable . Before a week had passed from the time of their meeting , he came to believe that he was going insane . Crack-up , going to pieces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew that whatever held him together as a self could not hold much longer . The mortar was drying out and crumbling , and one by one the stones would fall until finally there would be no more wall to mark the boundaries of who he was , and he would return to wilderness . He was certain that the scene with Rooney had never taken place.  |p190It  was the gaudy stuff of dreams  --  the lonely young wife offering her body to a stranger , Titania in love with an ass . The only evidence that he had of its realitywas a lingering sense of being sick , the throb of pain up through pain at suddenly thinking of her again after a little time of forgetting her ; at remembering  --  orso it seemed  --  a silvery jangle of braceletsas she had stirred beside him , the shadow of the lashes on her cheek when her eyes were closed . Was it possible that she had slept for a moment ? But he knew that dreams alone could haunt and sicken you like this . He could remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water spilled on a table top he had written with his finger a name that had made him weep , and how he had woken up weeping although he could no longer remember the name or why he had written it . And then , just as he was leaving the newspaper office at noon a few days later , he had seen her coming towards him across the street . Her hair was brushed back under a yellow band , and she was carrying a plant of yellow chrysanthemums . He had waited for her in the open doorway , his face lost somewhere between expressions , and she had passed close enough for him to have touched her if he dared , but she had neither looked at him nor avoided looking at him , had just walked past as though he was not there , and he had felt the top of his scalp go cold as death . The wall was crumbling fast . The handkerchief saved him . He had discovered it not long afterwards wadded up in the breast pocketp191of the jacket that he had worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimson with her lipstick . It proved nothing , of course , except his sanity , but by then he was only too glad to settle for that . He knew that at least it had really happened  --  for weeks he kept the handkerchief unlaundered in his top bureau drawer like a relic stained with the blood of a god  --  and so if she had not given him a new self , a youth that he had never known , at least she had restored to him the old self that he had thought never to find intactagain . The discovery of the handkerchief marked the beginning of convalescence , and it was not long before he was strong enough to play the game that she played . On the few occasions when their paths happened to cross again , you would have thought that they were blindmen passing . The gull , the woman , the infernal loneliness . . . He switched the light back on in his office : his littereddesk with the double-decker tray marked In and Out . He thought of Irma Reinwasser sitting there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child asleep in her lap . It was the child 's velvet cheek that he had brushed with the back of his hand , but he had meant it for Irma , some little touch of comfort to see her through the night because once she had told him what he had gone to hear , his heart had gone out to her . She looked so helplessly ugly with her great empty threat of a nose , a gristly old fowl guarding her pillaged nest . " Not a religious man , " Poteat wrote , " I nonethep192less found myself thinking of religious things . I thought of the Apostle Paul , that sawed-off little founder of churches in an alien world . I looked at the lavender sands and thought of him shipwrecked on the Isle of Malta . I thought of the letters that he wrote back to the churches at Corinth and Galatia and Philippi , and then I thought of the letter that he might have written to the church at Myron . . . The Epistle to the Myronians , chapter one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called to be saints , grace be unto you and peace , ' " Poteat wrote . " What is this I hear , brethren , of stirrings and uneasiness among you ? Though absent in the flesh , yet am I presentin the spirit to behold the face you turn to the world . It is a fair face to please both men and angels . This year 's bake sale more than doubled the take of the last . The new Sunday School rooms with their eye-ease green blackboards bear witness to the good works that proceed from faith . Who does not rejoice that the Every Member Canvass flourishes like a green bay tree ? I give thanks always for these things , yet , brethren , ought I not also to mourn ? " For it is reported that beneath the fairness of the face there is an evil smell among you even as there are evil smells among the pagans . One who is not the least of your number has vanished . And she who is another man 's pearl of great price has vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eaten out of Nicolet 's hand , Poteat knew . They had eaten the Gospel out ofp193his hand  --  his own brand of it , warmed and sweetened by no particular skill that he had as a preacher but by some curious lightness of heart that seemed to be in him , a way that he had in the pulpit of smiling sometimes as though he knew beyond all doubt a hilarioussecret which was that the glory that he was proclaiming either really was , or really was not , true , but that in either case it was a cause for lightheartedness : life was a joke too terrible or too wonderful to take any other way . They ate up anything that he chose to give them , jolly Saint Nick . Even the death of his wife they had fallen upon hungrily not as a thing to pity him for but as another tie that bound them  --  a wound that he had suffered gallantly , almost gaily , in their service . And when it became known that he was seeing more and more of young Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him for that because he had become for them not only a spiritual father but a debonair and devoted son , and what might have seemed unbecoming in one role only added to the enchantment of the other . Besides , it was unthinkable to them that what he held out in his open palm to her was any less innocent and bland than what he gave to nourish them . Here , kitty , kitty , kitty , was what Poteat heard the few times that he had gone out of curiosity to hear Nicolet preach  --  had seen Nicolet 's deep-set blue eyes brimming with their strange mirth as he coaxed the lean young tabby forward not to mention his old daughters- and mothers-in-God , God himself hep194coaxed , veni spiritu sane to  --  and although Poteat had tried to hate her for going to him , he failed in the attempt . It was like trying to hate his own youth , the whole belated twenty-four hours of it . Instead it was Nicolet that he turned his efforts to , not only for his evident success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the absurd ease of his success because for Poteat nothing had ever been easy . He had worked endlessly to become what he was , had raveled himself out in words , and what he had become , as more and more he grew to believe , was only the town eccentricand scandal-monger , the friend and confidant of Metzger the squirrel . An evil smell . " Oh foolish Myronians , who has bewitched you ? ' " he wrote . " You have been called to be in the world , not of it . But you reverence one who stands knee-deep in the fragrant muck of the world . Let no one be deceived . The little world of your church has become an image of the world as it is . Beneath the spotless napery of your sacred table lurk all the ancientbeasts  --  darkness and deceitful lust . Falsehood . Licentiousness . Brethren , believe me . I mourn for the Gospel . The good news proclaimed in your midst is that only the surface is good , only the face is fair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do not even the pagans proclaim as much ? Do not the pagans also rejoice at the beauty of the surface of the world ? Are they not also moved to eloquence by the lovelinessof sunlight on the outer skin of things ? " But the pagans are more honest than he amongp195you who has vanished because although with his lips he proclaims that underneath the fair surface are the everlasting arms , with his life and with his vanishing he confesses unintentionally what only the pagans have courage enough to declare openly : that the only arms to save are the soft , young arms of mortality which can not long deliver either him or the world from the everlasting stench and emptiness that lie beneath . " Peace and mercy be upon you . Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss , and I adjure you that this letter be read to all . . .. " ' The light of his desk lamp hurt his eyes , and his head ached . He took little tufts of hair and pulled them until the scalp stung . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tray marked Out . If Nicolet sometimes prayed to the best in the peoplewhom he knew , on occasion Poteat too held such exotic converse . Before the paper came out with his epistle , he indulged himself in imagining a number of confrontations resulting from it  --  most of them , of course , confrontations with Nicolet . Nicolet denied everything and swore vengeance . Nicolet admitted everything and begged mercy . Nicolet never came to him at all but was finally discovered with the column half chewed up in his gaping mouth , a suicide . On each occasion Poteat 's response was magnificently impassive , and even when he watched himself burned in effigy as an enemy of God and a slanderer  --  he envisioned it as taking place at sunset by the little round bandstand in front of the town hall  --  he stoodp196there with the firelight dancing in his face and half deafened by the caterwauling mob , but silent . To Rooney , on the other hand , he always had something to say . She came to him in different ways , at different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to sleep , he heard her foot on the stairs , and then she stood there in the moonlight of his fancy tellinghim that if he would publish a retraction of his charges , she would offer him herself again , and he said sadly and kindly , " Pal , I just ca n't risk myself again . You almost finished me with your favors the first time . I thought I was going to die of the terriblemooning for you in my bowels , and the only thing that saved me was your legs . The time I saw you again on the street with the flowers , I noticed that your legs are a little on the heavy side , not quite as straight as they might be , and you can never imagine how that helped . I made myself forget everything about you except the legs because they were the least lovely part of you , the least hard to lose . I know it 's patheticas hell , but it worked . It was on your legs , not mine , that I finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myronians came out in the Repositorythe afternoon of the day that Rooney returnedalone from Muscadine , and that evening Poteatand Metzger had supper together at Poteat 's house . Metzger brought lobsters  --  " You know how long to boil them , do n't you ? " he asked as he slid them out of the bag into the sink , sluggish and glittering . " Till they stop screaming , Willy boy . "  --  andp197Poteat supplied the rest of the meal and the liquor . Metzger insisted that they drink longer than Poteat wanted ; Metzger talked too much , on and on about how he had arranged with the sister he lived with a signal of knocks on the wall in case he should have a coronary , about a new heat mask that he had found for his sinus ; but Poteat was willing to forgive him anything for the sake of his mere physical presence on that strange and trying day , and he was grateful that it was health that Metzger made the subject of his conversation rather than the epistle . It must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as he remained , Poteat was able to live as though he had not written it . After dinner , when Metzger seemed on the point of going home , Poteat persuaded him to stay by bringingout slides of the trip that they had made to Europetogether the summer before . Looking scrawny and grey in his white duck trousers and a sport jacket that was too large for him in the shoulders , Metzger sat slumped in an arm chair with his bourbonwhile Poteat operated the projector which lit his face from beneath as he peered out into the darkened room . The slides both soothed and saddened him as he lingered slowly through them , trying to make them last  --  scenes of primal , vanished innocence . Franny Nicolet had scarcely been cold in her riverside grave at that point a year ago , and Rooney Vail had been only one of a number of parish ladies vying with each other to help ease the young pastor through thep198newness of his grief so that although Poteat had alreadylost her by then , he had not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socrates about to drink the hemlock , " Metzger murmured through his moustache : the picture on the screen showed Poteat sitting in Paris at a marvelously littered sidewalk table  --  the wine glasses and bread , a carafe of red wine , Metzger'ssun glasses which he must have set down there when he got up to take the photograph , all jeweled with light like a Vermeer , the colors richer than life . The camera had caught Poteat himself just as he had been leaning forward into the sun to pick up the carafe so that his face came out flat and white as a waxwork ; had caught the downward flick of his eyelids so that with only the whites of his eyes showingbeneath them , he looked drunk or blind as he groped for his death . In the next one , Poteat and Metzger , both in new Panama hats , stood side by side in front of Notre Dame . Then Poteat alone again , leaning against the deck rail of a channel steamer with the grey water behind him and the grey sky ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jolted the projector as he got up , and his image became a shadow in a blur of grey and silver . Switching on the outside light , he could see through the window that a fog had rolled in off the river , and when he opened the door , he found Rooney Vail standing there in the haze of it with a scarf tied over her hair . She held out her hand to him.  |p199Contrary  to all his earlier imaginings , he was neither silent nor eloquent but stammered out some wild banality as he let her in , unable even to control his face which refused to return her smile but waited , stunned and stupid , for some word from her to give it shape , and the word , he supposed , was meant to be one of reassurance . She said something about how she had been helping her husband take inventory at the shop nearby , as though this in itself explained why after six years or whatever it was that she had finally come , but his efforts to find some plausible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she said to respond to that too . Then , blessedly , old Metzger appeared from the livingroom with his bourbon in his hand and his necktie pulled crooked . He was all grinning confusion with butter on his whiskers from the screaming lobsters , dancing around them like a child at a bonfire , while Rooney untied her scarf , saying something about the fog that hovered at the door which Poteat had left open and which he closed now not so much to keep the fog out as at all costs to keep Metzger in , the safeguardof his presence . Metzger was drunk or playing drunk  --  " It 's always foul weather when old bachelors get together , " he said . " Beauty and the beasts . "  --  and as Metzger babbled , Poteat found it possible to meet Rooney 's glance finally , gave her a little nod that acknowledged what it must have cost her to come , promised in returnat least to ease Metzger out of the house becausep200only a coward would hold him there to prevent her sayingwhatever she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coward . She even seemed to be telling him this , to be urging him to stand up like a man if only so that she could somehow bring him to his knees . There could be no doubt that this was why she had come . " The clowns have to clear out now , " he said to Metzger , " so the animal act can begin , " and Metzger went gladly enough , nodding and grimacing like a fool . But once on the front step , out of sight of Rooney , he looked at Poteat with utter sobriety and slashed his finger from ear to ear across his throat . Rooney herself did not remain much longer . She never even took her raincoat off . She refused the drink that Poteat offered her . She sat down on a straight chair in the hall , and Poteat leaned back almostlazily against the wall with his hands in his pockets . They were like distant relatives meeting at a funeral , he thought , except that in some way the funeral was his own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was working again now : his face , his power of speech  --  he was silent but no longer through helplessness . She could have no way of knowing whose demise had brought them together . When he opened the door to find her there , he had felt one last gibbering of pain , of life , but now there was nothing . From where he stood he could see in the living room his shadowy shape blurred against the silver sky . So he had become . He was old Killian yawning through Armageddon.  |p201He  was old and safe at last . When she began to speak , he tested this . Her voice was hesitant and quiet , and she never took her eyes from his face . She told him that whatever he might believe , she and Nick were not lovers ; and he knew that even if she had said that they were lovers , it would have made no difference to him . She told him that Irma Reinwasser was sick with remorse at havingrevealed that she and Nick were together at Muscadine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman that if he could , wished vaguely that he had not charged her with wanting to ruin Nicolet , but it stirred nothing more to life in him than that . As he waited for her to come to the point , whatever it was , he wondered whether her tone would grow angry and threatening , or pleading , hurt ; but he felt in any case beyond the range of her fire . And what he marveled at more than anything was how little it mattered to him that she was actually there . For years he had dreamed her in and out of that house , every room of it , but now that she sat there with her scarf across her knees , a few ends of hair flattened out damp from the fog like sea-fern against her cheek , she could have been a shadow herself for all her presence moved him . Almost sleepily he studied her with his pale eyes . She had stopped speaking . It was as if her few words to him had been only some kind of formality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The heat of the projector bulb might set the slide on fire , Poteat thought , and then on thep202screen he would see himself , the ship , the sky , go up in flames . It did not matter . She held out her hand to him , and he took it . " I do n't even know what name to call you , " she said . This was the real test ; he smiled . " We 've never been introduced . " " I ca n't stand you to hate me , " she said , " if you do hate me . I ca n't see why else you 'd have written this thing . " " Oh , it 's not hate . Just an acid disposition . " He wanted to release the hand , but he felt that it would be to shirk the test . " I meant no offense . That 's a lot of jazz , " he said . " I meant offense . But I 'm not a hater . I do n't have the energy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's such a waste of something . Do n't hate Nick because of me . " " You came here for his sake , did n't you ? " " No . " She looked surprised by her answer . " Not for Irma 's either , though I promised her I 'd come . I just wanted to find out if I could look at you again . " She glanced away . " At your face . " " This face ? " He let her hand go and slowly , half dazed , touched his face first on one cheek and then on the other with the heel of his palm . " Old flabby ? " She nodded . In the distance , he heard a foghorn , more vibration than sound : the darkness trembling . " Well , can you ? " he asked . " Yes , thank God . " She smiled at him slightly . " But not with joy yet , I 'm afraid . "  | " Christ almighty . . . joy ! " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look at it is a low belch . Joy ? " He shook his head . " Jesus . " " How about when you look at me ? " Once with her thumbs she had shaped his face like clay , and he thought how easy it would be with his answer now to shape hers any way he chose . " I look at you with . . . " The sense of sheer power made him pause . There was nothing he might not do with that dreamed face leaning toward him : make it twitch with pain , burst like a dry pod . But she was in his house , sitting in his chair ; he felt a curious gentlenesstowards her . " I look at you , " he sighed , the great dimples deep in shadow , his head a little to one side as he gazed at her . " With infinite regret . With gratitude for whatever crackpot whim it was that made you once look on me with favor . " Just for one instant then before she could speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all too late , too ludicrous , this little lurch of life in the midst of his dying ; that what brimmed in her eyes as she sat there pressing her face between her hands was more than gratitude for his having said nothing worse , more that pity . " I 've got to tell you something , " she said . " God knows why you of all people . . . my enemy . I have n't even said it to Clem . " Poteat squared his shoulders against the wall . Althoughhe was looking directly at her , he could not seem to see her well . It was as if the light be/tween them was bent , like light through a prism . " I planned to ask you to lay off Nick , " she said . " For your own sake as much as his or mine , or Irma 's . Even if people believe what you wrote about him , you 're the one they 'll hate for it , you know . They 'll lap it up , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lapping it up . But I want to say something else now . " She smoothed out the damp kerchiefthat lay across her knees , looking down at it . " If there 's really such a thing as joy on this earth , the sort religious people pray to God for , I think I 've caught a little of it , God knows how , or why me , or anything . I need to say that to you . To look at you with that inside me . " There was bewilderment in her eyes as she looked up at him again . " I think I 'm going to be able to have a baby , " she said . There was something almost homely about her , Poteatthought , as she sat there with her heavy legs , the raincoat that was too long for her . Her mouth was too large , her eyes not large enough . Poteat found that he wanted to cause her some deep and memorable pain . He gave the wall a thump with his fist and laughed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you and congratulations to the lucky father . " He opened the front door and stood with his back to her , looking out . " Whoever you think the lucky father 's going to be . " He saw the fog hanging there like a curtain , behind it the cackling night.  |p205IRMA  REINWASSER dreamed that Heinz Taffelwas dead and that the whole camp had been assembledto witness his funeral . It was snowinglightly , and everything looked quiet and beautiful . The prisoners were drawn up on three sides of agreat hollow square with the row of grey barracksmaking the fourth side . In the center of the squarewas an iron cot where the corpse had been placed . It was dressed in black and lay on its side in such away that Irma could not see its face . A prisoner beside her  --  it was the cross-eyed little Silbermann fromMainz  --  whispered , " There is worse to come . Theyare going to strip us all naked and make us standhere till we freeze to death , " but she was not afraid , and she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said . At the head of the cotstood Nicolet in the S.S. uniform . You could notmake out his words , but he was reciting some kind ofprayer for the dead which lasted a long time andp206seemed to bore him . Every few moments he would turn his head to one side and titter stagily behind his hand . Then , slowly , the corpse began to roll over on its back until everyone could see that it was Heinz Taffel , who was smoking a long , black cigar . At first Nicolet did not seem to notice what had happened . Then with no sign of emotion , he took his pistol from the holster and started to hit Taffel again and again on the head with the butt . As the blows rained down on him , Taffel turned his face towards Irma . It was dripping with sweat , and for a moment , as their eyes met , he gave her a tortured smile . Silbermann tried to stop her , but Irma broke ranks and started runningtowards Taffel through the snow . " Verzeihung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Taffel 's throat came what sounded like the clucking of a chicken . Nicolet picked Lizard Boy up with both hands around her waist and held her at arm 's length above his head where against the vast , blue sky she flapped her arms and kicked her legs . He knelt in the grass to hug Pie Face , sliding one hand under her dress to feel the warm , bare back with its delicate cage of bone , the cool little rear . " Every night we said godbless for you , " she said . " We saw a man with a black tongue , " Lizzie said . " I missed you like crazy , pig girls . " " Did you bring us a surprise ? " Lizard Boy hadp207taken him by the ear . " I must have something in here . " Nicolet felt in his pocket . All that he could find was the postcard from Rooney and Leon 's New Testament . He handed the New Testament to Cornelia . " That belonged to your great-grandfather , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . " " Probably he is in Heaven . " Lizzie said . " ' Will we ever see him ? " " I would n't be surprised . " Nor would he , Nicolet thought . He laughed , pulling Lizzie 's thumb out of her mouth like a cork from a bottle . Whatever it meant , the resurrection of the body must involve something like seeing , something like meeting . As a child you took the language of the faith literally ; then you learned to take it symbolically before you could see that you had been more nearly right in the first place . He pictured Leon reaching out to the two children as they raced toward him across some field of miracle . In eternity , everyone became the age when he had been most truly alive ; old children might dandle their babblingfathers on their knees . " What 's it about ? " Cornelia held the shabby littlevolume in her hand . She had found that there were no pictures in it . " The little Lord Jesus and how he grew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other 's mine ! " Lizzie pulled the postcard from his hand . " What does it say ? "  | " Thinking of you in Muscadine , ' " he read . " Where 's that ? " " It 's where I 've been . " " Who was thinking about you there ? " " He was , " Cornelia said , pointing to the picture of the dapper young man . " That 's Jesus when he grew up . Irma was asleep in a canvas deck chair where she had been sitting to watch them play . The baseball cap was down over her eyes , her mouth agape and moving . " Pretend she 's the sleeping beauty and you 're the prince . " They had run over to her chair and stood at the foot of it . She could have been a great doll sprawled lifelessthere with one arm spilled off to the side and trailing in the grass . Nicolet placed his finger to his lips and went up behind her . Gently he removed the baseball cap . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she opened her eyes , she saw only the children ; the kiss was part of her dream 's secret . Nicolet made a face at his daughters . Cornelia coveredher mouth with both hands . Lizzie ran off all tipsy like a dead leaf blowing . Irma raised her eyes to find Nicolet looking down at her . " Gott . . . " she whispered . " I came back , you see . " " Did you read it ? " He nodded . " It 's my fault . You told me not to say anything ,  |p209but  I did . " She had not changed her position in the chair , her hand still dangling in the grass . Except for her eyes and mouth , she could have been totally paralyzed . " Maybe I told him on purpose , I do n't think so . " I do n't think so . Anyway , it does n't matter . I 'm innocent . " " Nobody 's innocent . " " Calvinist , " he said . " Everybody 's innocent . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other alive . . . " She struggled to remember how it had happened in the dream . She had run to him through the snow , but it was too late . They had rolled him into a grave and were shoveling earth in on top of him . She herself had picked up a handful or two and dropped them in . Finally all that showed above ground was the end of the cigar , glowing and fading as he breathed in and out . " I 've got to help you . Some way I 'm going to put things right for you . You tell me how . " The small , half dreaming eyes committed him slowly to memory . " No . Even if you knew , you would never tell me . " Cornelia had untied one of Irma 's gym shoes and then more or less tied it again . Now the foot was a pony , and she plumped down heavily in the saddle . At first they all thought  --  even Nicolet  --  that Irma was making a joke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up like that , shriveled , for any serious purpose.  |p210Metzger  woke up feeling miserable . It was the bourbon after supper , he thought , and he knew that he should never have eaten the lobster . Twice duringthe night he had been awakened by heartburn  --  the dry , distending ache in the chest that swelled up into the neck and jaws . He had thought of the possibility of its being a coronary and toyed with the idea of testing the signal that he had arranged with his sister : three sharp raps on the wall . One or two raps might be accidental , but there could be no mistakingthree ; and she was to come in immediately withoutknocking . But the pain had subsided , and he had gone back to sleep . Now he could hear the vacuum going in the hall . Only half awake , he thought that if misery could make a sound , that was the sound that it would make . Commencement had been last week . Except for a littletutoring , that meant no more teaching until September . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his leisure , and walk down to Thelma 's for a late breakfast . His room got no direct sun until late afternoon , but by the quality of the shade he could tell that it was a beautiful day . All of this should have cheered him up , he thought , yet he continued to feel so depressed that he could not bring himself to get out of bed . Nor could he think what it was that depressedhim . It was true that old Willy had insulted him , had called him a clown in front of the youngp211Vail woman and had virtually thrown him out of the house , but that was their way with each other . Willy patronized him ; he made fun of Willy . It all evened out . It passed the time . It was not enough to account for this sense of defeat , of bereavement almost . After breakfast he would treat himself to a few hours at Cully 's , the bookstore . That would restore him . Books were his passion . He did not even have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , and bookshelves reached from floor to ceiling along two walls of his room . He loved the feel and the smell of books , the cockatoo covers of paperbacks , the austerespines of the university presses , and he arranged them on his shelves with self-conscious perversity : Havelock Ellis and Emily Dickinson , Kierkegaard and Rider Haggard , a row of Penguin mysteries dwarfed by the fat terra cotta volumes of the Variorum Shakespeare . He thought of them as a mirror of his variegated soul , hoarded by Squirrel against the comingof winter . For in this respect his nickname did not displease him , suggesting as it did a creature both nimble and prudent , a twitch and skedaddle of antic spirit through the pencil-smelling dusk of highschoolcorridors . To add to his shelves was to add to himself , and this thought got him to the edge of his bed where he sat with his head in his hands looking down at his bare feet . There would be breakfast  --  Thelma served hashbrownpotatoes with all orders , salty and crisp  --  the walk down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill to Cully 's . He felt better already , snapped his toes against the linoleum . " Hot spit , " he said to himself , a kind of doxology . " Up and at ' em , Metzger boy . " Then he gave a little belch that brought up something bitter and stinging to the pit of his throat : heartburn . With it the sadness returned . Something was missing , lost to him forever , and as he arched his neck back with a skeleton 's grin , he knew what it was . When Rooney Vail had burst in mad as a wet hen at the outrageous piece in the Repository , he had thanked his stars that he was not old Willy . He had fled gladly . But what he had fled was just what hexed him now . It had been an ugly scene , he was sure  --  garbled , teary , unnecessary  --  but human at least , with the blood trembling and fire in the bowels . A life lacerating a life . The gust of it had blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no place for a squirrel . Willy had not even thought to introduce him . It was as if among the living he had no name . Nicolet stared up at the snowy white church . The wooden steps mounted to the double doors which were hooked open to let the day in ; the newly gilded Romannumerals glittered against the black dial , above it the spire rose sharp as a pin . The church as mother , Nicolet thought : cockeyed old sloven with her arms flung wide to embrace the world . The church as virgin : aloof and inviolate , suffering only the pure top213approach . This afternoon on Congress Street she was all virgin , laced up to the chin in goose-white clapboard , Christ 's maid . Nicolet scratched the flaked stair-rail with his thumbnail and read : " Pentecost : the Birthday of the Church . " Clack , clack , he thought , and a wildness , a gaiety , stirred in him as he boarded her : the church as ark  --  whitewashed , barnacled , smelling of the sea . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Betty Blackburn sat blinking at him through pixie glasses over her typewriter . She had lips painted on where she had no lips , her grey hair brushed back under a little wreath of braid . " Like the madam of a Quaker whorehouse , " Rooney said once . " You 're excommunicated , " Betty Blackburn said , pointing a pencil at him . " Blackballed . " " Blackbird , " he said . " They 're going to strip me of my prayer shawl and ephod ? " " One by one . You 've had it . " " It 's been great working for you . A privilege . " He reached over the typewriter , and they shook hands . " All 's quiet on the western front , " she said . " You mean it ? " " The ones I 've seen seem to be taking it in their stride anyway . " " Have they read the thing ? " " Everybody 's read it . " " But they did n't believe it . " " At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you ? "  |p214She  gave him a long , quizzical stare . " Willy Poteat'sa nut . " " You 're a good chap , " Nicolet said . He wanted more than anything to go upstairs into the empty sanctuary , to sit there in a back pew under the choir loft until , like sleep or some forgotten name , prayer came . " Before you do anything else , " his secretary said , " Mrs. Cusper has been phoning in all morning . She 's got to see you something terrible . " Betty Blackburn rolled her eyes behind her pixie glasses . " Was she speaking in tongues ? " " I 'm afraid so . " " I better go , " Nicolet said although he knew well enough what he would find once he got there . Madge Cusper never explained the obscure crises that prompted her four or five times a year to summon him , and if he questioned her directly , she would not answer . She would fix him with her bulbous eyes and smile dimly . Her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing of a lion . The top panes of her parlor windows were of coloredglass , a checkerboard of green and amber squares with the sun burning through them  --  a crazy little shrine with Madge its deity : head of a beast on the body of a woman . Here too a prayer might come , he thought . Her breath was fruity with the smell of gin . " How are your two little girlies ? " she asked . " I had a little girlie of my own once , but she got whiterp215and whiter and whiter , and one fine day she just faded out of the picture . She did n't have enough red blood . Just white blood . Like bugs . Butterflies . God 's so vague . " She gave a sly smile , her eyelids wavering under their own weight . " Sent me a butterfly instead of a baby . Herbert Cusper walked out on me then . " She made a purring sound . Nicolet said nothing . Silence , like a poultice , could draw the poison out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleft to her nose . She belonged in The Peaceable Kingdom of Edward Hicks , he thought , parting the ferns with velvet paws and peering through , sleepy and fierce . The orange fuzz was a golden mane . " I was so sad to hear about your wife , Nicky . Everybodyhated hearing about it . Hated it ! " She drew her paws tight on the arms of her chair and leaned forward . " Now they 're crucifying that little Episcopalwhat's-its-name  --  Denbigh . What if he did run off with somebody 's wife ? Did you read it , Nicky ? " " It 's not about Denbigh . It 's about me . " She was dressed as if for a garden party in powder blue with powder blue gloves , a string of white summer beads tight about her thick neck . She turned away from him toward the window , her lion-face softening . " Will you help a lady in distress , kind sir ? A lady like me . . . . " Did you pray when you made your calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peace be in this house . "  --  and when you were asked to , of course : a grace at meals , a prayer for the bereaved , thep216dying . But how about when you were not asked ? It was not for a prayer that Madge Cusper was pleadingbut for comfort , advice , reproof , all of which he had given her often before . She could not bring herself to look at him now , asking for what she knew was of no use to either of them . She was purring again , gazing out beneath the green and amber panes as out of a cave . He stood behind her chair with his two hands on her head , seeing himself in the convex mirror as some kind of hairdresser . The carroty hair was surprisingly thin , her scalp hot and hard through it . Her skull beneath his hands . She sat stiff . " Lie down with a plastered old lion , thou blessed lamb of God , " he prayed . " Place thy hands on my hands and use my guttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thy healing grace , that she may kindle to thy dancing at the heart . . . . " They had come through the apple trees with the sunlight flickering on them , such a fine-looking pair , Roy thought . Theo could have been a young prince with his white shirt bloused out over his trousers and open at the throat , and his friend could have been his squire , his equerry , whatever princes had  --  both of them fresh-shaven , vigorous , smelling of toothpasteand soap . Except for the friend 's dog collar , you could never have guessed that they were priests but world-beaters , rather  --  crack young salesmenp217stuffing their faces before starting out on their routes . He wished that Zimmer had been awake at that hour to see them having breakfast with him . They includedhim in their conversation , treated him with such deference . It would have made her eat her words about Theo 's being an undutiful son and coming only once a year to see his old dad . " Every time you have to die to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a son is that ? "  --  he had heard that often enough  --  but there in the kitchen that morning what had bound them was life , not death . Even Zimmer would have seen it . Among all the clatter and fragrance of breakfast , they were boys together . He had fed them waffles with sausagesand coffee that he boiled in a saucepan with a raw egg broken in to settle the grounds . It was all so rapid-fire and rollicking that it befuddled him a little , and he let them do most of the talking , just sat there with a dazed , buttery smile trying to follow . The evening before , in the barber chair , Theo had embraced him , he thought . Theo had forgiven him for being less than a father ; he had forgiven Theo for being less than a son  --  something like that . He did not want to think of it now but to save it until Theo was gone , but it kept coming back at him there in the kitchen ; how Theo had buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zimmer pounding on the floor over their heads . He remembered seeing tears falling into his son 's hair before he realized that they were his own tears , but this time Theo had not called him a cry-baby although God knows , hep218thought , that was the truth of it . " Have some more syrup , boys , " and he poured it for them , spiraling it out from the center to fill all the squares evenly . Theo 's friend told a long joke about a priest and a rabbi appearing before Saint Peter , and a jet of steam from the tea kettle tumbled up a shaft of sun towards the window . " What a breakfast , what a breakfast ! " They seemed to know that it was , building it for him , block on block , to last him a long time  --  coffee smell , sausage smell , young men 's crisp morning laughter . Whatever had happened between himself and Theo , he was afraid to press it too far , to catch Theo 's eye now for fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had brought them together , he thought  --  his saga of Leon 's last days  --  and that only added to his fears because everything that Leon touched , in death as in life , turned to dust : the Comet Fire Kindler , the crusade against Mr. Durfee , now the reconciliation between his son and the grandson whom he had never seen . " Le bon Dieu should be proud to have you two on his payroll , " he said , " so bright-eyed and bushytailed . You 've brightened an old man 's twilight . But it 's a long haul back to Myron . Maybe you ought to get started . " Then he could have bitten off his tongue . He wanted them so desperately to stay . They had not even finished their coffee yet . " But I do n't mean this second . Not till you 've had one of these anyway . " And he fumbled for the cigars in the breast pocket of hisp219shirt , offered them each one which they refused . His hand shook as he lit one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he seemed to be looking at Theo through a swarm of bees . But at least now he was looking at him , daring doom , and Theo , his boy , God 's boy , was smiling back at him through the tiny , bright wings . " Welcome home , my son . . . " He spoke with the cigar in his mouth , felt the wet of it trickling down his lower lip , but nothing mattered now , only that their eyes had met without flinching . " You 've got your sleeve in the butter , " Theo said . Roy heard it as a benediction . " Who knows , in another year he may come again , " Zimmer said after they had gone . They were standing in her bathroom , the medicine cabinet opened on her corn plasters , the bottles that she blued her hair with . He had fixed her toilet . Inside the water box , the plunger had just come unhooked from the handle . Probably she had done it herself to annoy him . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , he thought , he might have taken her to bed with him and punished her there ; he had always had more than ordinary success with his female boarders . But this morning he contented himself with reaching out and tapping her on the collar bone with a finger still wet from his tinkering . " Matter of fact , he asked me down to Myron for the weekend , " he said , " so you betterquit the sabotage till I get back . " Then , even as he said it , he decided to make the lie good . Theo had asked him nothing of the kind ,  |p220but  he would go anyway and surprise him . There was nothing now that he did not dare , and , besides , Theo was in some sort of trouble  --  why else had the friend driven half the night to fetch him ? Maybe he needed a father at last . But before he set off the next morning  --  hewas sitting in his chair by the window pullingup his socks  --  he took a dime out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes . They were oldfashionedshoes that laced up above the instep , and although it was a warm June morning , he wore his long underwear so that when he stood up to pull on his trousers , he looked like an old acrobat about to go teetering off on the high wire.  |p221ON  SUNDAY morning it rained hard in Myron , bouncing off the sidewalks , racingdown the gutters . Stiff gusts of wind from the northeast lashed it against the church on Congress Street , and most people arrived in cars for the eleven o'clock service , a policeman in a yellow slicker waving them into the parking lot , halting them at intervals to let the ones who came on foot cross over from the far side . Metzger came on foot , waiting with his umbrella tilted against the wind while Grogan helped a pair of old ladies up the steps . Irma Reinwasser splashed across the street with an Army surplus raincoat over her head as Roy Nicolet , hatless , followed her majesticallyin a poncho of his son 's that billowed out around him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low , grey sky . Inside the double doors , among the coat racks , there was a smell of wet wool , wet rubber  --  outside , the smell of the sea . The church was the ark , Nicolet thought , with thep222grey waves starting to sweep up over the beaches , scudding over the flats and meadowland until they lapped against door sills , down cellar stairs , and finally set her afloat  --  cumbersome old menagerie , her timbers shuddering and steeple-mast flailing back and forth as the flood took her . It was being set afloat that was the birthday of the church  --  being cut adrift , bound for somewhere . And the birthday of the church was only the birthday of the heart writ large : you went where the waves willed . Through the door of the vestry where he sat alone waiting for the organist 's cue to enter , he could see that the center section was filled and the ushers had already started filling the side pews . Poteat had packed the place , he thought . During the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his frontdoor , and Irma was the first to see it . He had found her there trying to sweep it off with a broom when he came down for breakfast . " Schwein , " she had said . " Wir Sind alle Schweine . " " Take my advice , son , " Roy had said . " Expose him for the scoundrel he is  --  a bearer of false witness , a neurotic . Put on the armor of righteousness . Denouncehim from the pulpit ! " His scorched eyes were aghast as he chopped at the air with his fist ; then suddenly , lowering his voice , he looked away . " There 's hot blood in the Nicolets , Theo . I of all people should know . And she 's passing fair , Theo . There 's no doubt of that . You can speak to your dad . " The children were fascinated by their grandfather , builtp223wonderful new games around him . " You bleed , " Corneliainstructed him , " and we 'll be the doctors . " He let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while they struggled to undo the top buttons of his shirt . " He 's pathetic , pathetic , Nick , " Rooney said over the telephone . " Pray like Hell for him , please . For my sake . " " I 'll do better than that , " he said . " I 'll go see him . " " Is that better ? " " It 's harder . " " Clem says there 's talk about the merchants withdrawingtheir ads from the paper . " " How is Clem ? " " He has great , bright wings . Wherever he walks , you find little white flowers growing afterwards . He 's sitting beside me now , throwing up . " " Then you 're O.K. ? " he said . " No sweat ? " " None . " " Just one question then . " Betty Blackburn came into his office bringing the mail . He waited until she had left . " Was Willy the one . . . the stranger ? " " Bless the memories , Nick . Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Poteat later that day . At the newspaper they said that he was probably at home , but at his house there was no answer to the doorbell . The door was ajar , and Nicolet walked in , calling his name up the stairs , but again there was no answer.  |p224Standing  in a man 's empty house was like watching a man while he slept ; even compassion became espionage . Yet he could not bring himself to leave immediately . A window curtain swelled , then sucked flat against the screen . He stepped into the living room where there was a slide projector set up on a table . He switched it on and saw Willy Poteat standing against a silvery sky on what might have been a bridge . " Willy , " he called again , less now from any hope of being heard than from the desire to justify his presence there if only to himself . " Willy ? " What would he have said if he had found him there , he wondered . Less and less he seemed to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had probably frightened Madge Cusper half to death , had certainly frightened himself ; prayers came unbidden . " Do you love her , Willy ? Is that the secret your house keeps ? " He spoke to the picture on the screen . " Is that the secret of every house ? Love bangs on the wall trying to be heard . Sometimes it sounds like hate , sometimes like a shutter flapping . Sometimesit sounds like two branches clacking . " He switched off the projector and turned to go but stopped at the door . " Peace be in this house , " he called up the stairs . Rain beat against the vestry window , and he felt his pulse quicken . It was nearly eleven . He could hear the prelude drawing to an end , then there would be the introduction to the opening hymn and he would step through into the chancel and take his place atp225the high-backed chair behind the pulpit . When he stood up , his black preacher 's robe nearly touched the floor , the broad , black velvet band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisp and white from his collar . He opened his hymnal to make sure that the sermon was there . His mouth was dry . " I was glad when they said unto me , Let us go into the house of the Lord . ' " No preacher had written that , he thought . " I was sick to my stomach when they said unto me . . . " That was more like it . The madnessof presuming to speak for God ; better , if you had the courage , to stand up there and be silent for God or to say , as he had dreamed by Roy 's barn of saying , just " Yes . It is true about God . Whoever would have believed it ? But it is true . " And then the silence , he thought . No organ hamming it up . Just the slap and rattle of the rain at the tall windows . The organist 's hand must have slipped . He had been modulating the prelude to a close , to the moment'spause before the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a scream of astonishment , and he lurched immediately into the hymn before anyone was quite ready for it . The effect was oddly terrifying . Then as the choir started to sing and the congregation rose to its feet , Nicolet stepped through the little door , crossed the chancel , and stood by the oak chair . Joyful , joyful , all adore Thee , God of glory , Lord of love.  |p226Hearts  unfold like flowers before Thee , Opening to the sun above . He read the opening words without singing them , then closed his eyes for a moment , prayed . " Be with me in thy house . " Melt the clouds of sin and sadness , Drive the dark of doubt away . Faster , faster , he thought , starting to sing himself ; each verse should leave the lungs aching for breath . Giver of immortal gladness , Fill us with the light of day . He spotted Rooney and Clem . They had taken places much farther front than usual , and instead of her broad-brimmed black hat , Rooney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all see that she was there , unabashed , with her husband beside her . Nicoletwondered if she was adding up the hymn numbersto find if they came out even . He hoped that they did . In the front pew sat three boys in their late teens , two of whom were strangers to him but one of whom he knew that he had seen somewhere although it was several moments before he could remember where . It was the boy who had picked him up on the road to Muscadine  --  still chewing something , it seemed , but with his hair slicked back now , uncomfortable in shirt and tie . Nicolet wondered if thep227rumors of scandal had brought him or possibly just curiosity to see in action a man whom he had every reason to think was out of his mind . Nicolet tried to catch his eye and nod to him , but the boy did not notice , his smooth jaws working as though he was trying to crack a seed between his front teeth . They were his people , his ark  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no less than the old ladies  --  and if he had had to go by way of Muscadine to reach that knowledge , it had not been too far to go , he thought , although he had returned with little enough to give them : like the sprig of olive in the beak of Noah 's dove , only a scrap of splendor from a derelict orchard to bear witness to the presence of a land , a hope , beyond the grey sea-swells . Half way through the last stanza , he stepped up to the lecternwhere he opened the large Bible in the middle and placed his notes on it , then leaned forward into the fresh silence that came with the end of the singing . " The Lord is nigh unto all them that call to him , " he called out to them , holding on to the sides of the lectern . " To all that call upon him in truth . He will fulfil the desires of them that fear him . He will also hear their cry and save them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered how long he could hold them with it before the first clearing of throats , creaking of pew and floor board . " Ask , and it shall be given unto you . Seek , and ye shall find . Knock , and it shall be opened unto you , " he said . Then , " Let us pray , " and a great shuffling and rustling came asp228they bowed their heads . " We knock fists against the walls that wall us off from brothers . Give them to hear us . Give us to hear the terrible needs that beat like hearts behind brothers ' walls . " We knock fists against the walls that wall us off from you . Hear us and know the loneliness of lives walled up in flesh and rib . " As he looked up , Nicolet avoided the eyes of those who had not bowed their heads , glancing past them to the windows where he could see the trees that grew along Congress Street tossing in the wet wind . " Holy Spirit that set fire to the saints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curtains of the air and show the glory forth . . . " It was the prayer that he had written but not the prayer that he felt now something wilder now , he wanted , a Lillian Flagg prayer , old rugged cross of a Jesus prayer in that sane and stately place  --  but he was bound to the words before him and hurried through them to the General Confession . " Let us confess our sins unto Almighty God , " he said . He thought at first that someone had fainted . There was a stir in the pews at his right toward the back of the church . Two or three people seemed to half rise , then sit again . Several voices were murmuring at once , and Nicolet hesitated on the brink of his praying . A woman stood up . " I confess my sins to you , Herr Pastor , " she calledp229out , Irma Reinwasser waving a hymnal above her head as though she needed to catch his eye in that place where already all eyes had turned toward her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dread  --  had fire broken out , someone suffered a stroke right there on Congress Street ? " I am going to confess to you and to the people of this town , " she cried . " It is the only God I got . " " Let her alone ! " His voice rang harsh and metallic through the public address system as , leaning forward , he almost touched the microphone with his lips and the feedback whined to a shrill needle of sound . He raised his hand to stop the usher who had hurried to her from his station by the side door and was reaching for her now across the laps of the three or four who sat as if paralyzed between her and the aisle . As Nicolet spoke , the usher drew back as though he had touched fire . For a moment it seemed to him that Irma herself was on the verge of drawing back . Then she began to speak again . It was less like a dream than as if all the churchery that had gone before it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , the black priest 's robe he wore with the starched white tablets of the law at his throat , all were symbols of what only now was gathering to a madness of truth : Irma tellingwild , holy lies to save him , offering herself up to the slaughtering eyes of Congress Street for him . Separated by wave on wave of turned heads , their faces almost touched now , hers in the devouring storm/light drifting , swelling , like a cloud as he watched it . He whispered " No , " and the sound rolled out like distant thunder from the high speakers , but no one noticed . The church was hers . " They are my fault , " she said , " the things they are telling about the pastor . I myself started the rumors . All the bad seeds , I planted them . Ask the newspaper man . I , Reinwasser , was the one that told him the pastor was with a woman . Sure the pastor was with a woman . He went in mercy , bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to her like a pastor , but Reinwasser told the newspaper man he went like her lover . He wrote down in the newspaper the lies I told him . Only now I am confessing it . " The organist had left his bench to peer down at her from the choir loft , his pince-nez revolving slowly on their black cord as he leaned way out . In the front of the church , people were kneeling on their pews to get a better view of what was taking place behind them ; the boy who had given Nicolet a ride had come as far as the lowest chancel step to look back over them , his jaws finally at rest . She had no form or comeliness that they should look at her , Nicolet thought , no beauty that they should desire her , hunched up there in her soldier 's raincoat , a gnome of sorrows , acquainted with God only knew what . " Now I am also going to confess why I wanted to hurt him so then you will know everything , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was jealous . Because he would not look at me , an ugly woman . Because hep231has eyes only for God . Do you understand it ? I made up the lies to hurt him because I had crazy love for him , a young man , and he had nothing for me exceptmaybe he was sorry for an old beat-up Jew woman . Now I am the one who is sorry . It is too much . So you know the truth now , and you are going to forget all the lies I made . You are going to be good to this pastor again now and not write filth on his sidewalk for children to read . " She had squeezed herself past the knees of the peoplebeside her as she finished and stood for a moment in the empty center aisle . The church was silent as if snow was falling in it and they were all prisonersof the silence and the snowing . Nicolet cupped both hands over his mouth as though trying to warm them . An ancient female voice quavered , " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a companion shushed her . But again , like paper crackling , " What did she say . . . ? " Irma Reinwasser had gone . There was the sound of her heavy shoes creaking down the stairs . Nicolet came down from the pulpit as far as where the boy was standing , put his hands on his shoulders and softly shoved him back towards his seat . The organist mounted his bench again . Breathing heavily , Roy Nicolet leaned his head back until it rested on the back of the pew , and sitting behind him , Madge Cusper had a nearly irresistible impulse to seize his candy-white hair in her teeth . Metzger kept his eyes fixed on the Vails . They looked expensive , he thought . People said the money was hers.  |p232Nicolet  did not return to the pulpit but remained on the steps , face and hands of wood . Two hundred , three hundred , sat there waiting for him to say something , to make it all right again , and he waited with them , his curiosity no less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a fool of himself with the children  --  sticking his thumbs in his ears and wagglinghis fingers at them , ruffling up his hair and gibbering like a troll under a bridge  --  he had speculatedwith Franny about what would happen if he got up some Sunday and did such a thing in the pulpit , stuck a flower from the communion table behind his ear and whirled around like a top with his black skirts flying . The chances were , he had decided , that they would choose to doubt their own senses rather than so fundamental a part of their faith as that nothing untowardever happened at the eleven o'clock service . A minister , like the God that he served , was a gentleman , after all , so what they were waiting for him to say now , Nicolet thought , was in one way or another that nothing had happened , that the wiry little apparitionwho had disturbed the grey peace that did not pass their understanding was just something that the Junior Sunday School had put together out of papier mache to top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best that he could do in their eyes would be to continue from where she had interruptedhim with the General Confession . They could bow their heads , and when they lifted them again , all would be well . But other words rose in his throat , hisp233eyes asking their forgiveness as he spoke . " These rumors you 've heard about my sins of the flesh are only rumors , that 's the truth , " he said , " but that 's about the only truth there was in what she told you . It 's not true she started the rumors , of course . It 's also not true I went to Muscadine to bring God to anybody . As much as anything , I went to get away from God . To get away from you . " Without the microphone , his voice sounded flat and muffled in the great room . He could see some of them cupping their ears  --  old eyes glazed , old jaws clamped tight  --  in their effort to listen . " I wanted to get away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his words . " But away from God too , " he added , a sudden queer rush of tenderness for them making him smile , smile and almost shout at the same time . " So do n't be sad  --  at least you were in good company . And anyway , it did n't work . You can see I did n't make it . If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea , even there shall thy hand lead me . ' It led me back to you again . " Holding a knot of his robe to keep from tripping on it as he went up the steps , he turned to go back to the pulpit . He had said all that he had to say , he thought . Now he could go on with the service . He had come back to them , his people , his ark . He had not known until now how much he wanted to preach to them again , just now , with the rain drumming at the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life he felt that he had something to tell them  --  like the rain , it comes down , the power from on high , wells up like a secret spring , the deep magic and laughter of God  --  and for the first time in their lives , perhaps , they would actually listen to him because they had come to listen . Always before they had thought , and with reason , that they knew what to expect from him , but now , thanks to Poteat , they did not know what to expect him either to say or to be . The time was ripe . But then , as he looked down from the lectern at their faces , grey in the rain-light , he knew that the time had passed . It was Irma 's church still with Irma 's ghost haunting them , Irma 's voice still ringing in their ears . What would a sermon on Pentecost mean to them now who wanted to hear only what the filth was that had been written on his walk and who had written it there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hymnal in the air . Whatever else they might doubt of her confession , they would not doubt that . To his horror , he realized that he did not doubt it himself . Why else would she have tried to save him , to take upon herself the chastisement that would make him whole ? The Suffering Servant of the Lord , he thought ; was it always like this to be suffered for by another , to be given at such sickening cost a gift that you did not want ? Had he for years preached the sacrifice of the cross only in the end to be revolted by it ? He felt the self-mutilation of Irma Reinwasserhanging at his neck like a dead cat as he stoodp235there in the pulpit while the congregation waited in silence with their faces uptilted as if to see a man performa dangerous trick in the air . The trick was to hide his anger from them , if possible to hide it from himself  --  this sudden idiot anger at Irma for the pain that he had caused her without knowing or wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one irrecoverable moment when he might have preached and been heard . Nicoletsaw in his mind the muddy face and flailing hand as she had debased herself for his sake , and for a moment of great ugliness and great peace he hated her . " Let us confess our sins unto Almighty God , " he said , not bowing his head but staring out at them with his turquoise eyes round and surprised as a child 's . When it came time for the sermon , he read it rather than preached it , ran his thumb from line to line to guide his reading . The words that he had written with excitement fell from his mouth dead . Ordinarily when he preached , he needed only an occasionalglance at his manuscript , typed out by Betty Blackbird on small half-sheets , but now he felt lashed to it , hardly dared lose touch with it for an instant for fear that he would lose everything then and drown . In Jerusalem there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing , mighty wind . Faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden lips . This was the sermon . But on Congress Street , the old ark foundered , its decks awash , and between pulpit andp236pews Nicolet could feel the sea rising . Then he stood just inside the open door shaking hands with them as the rain spattered on the glisteningsteps . No one lingered to chat with him  --  just the touch of the hands , the murmuring , eyes lowered and uneasy . It could have been a funeral . " Nice sermon . . . we 're all behind you . . . sorry about the ruckus . . . " More of them than usual went out the side doors to avoid him . The air felt cool to his perspiringface . Voices in the rain , the slap of windshield wipers , Denbigh 's chimes ringing from Whittier Street  --  it all revived him a little . He crouched down to shake hands with a child who curtsied precariously . Farther back in the line , he could see Roy , his face puffed , pursed , to say something enormous , but by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed to have spent itself and he said nothing , just stood there for a moment in silence with Nicolet 's hand clasped in both of his , smelling of bay rum , then moved unsteadily off into the wet like a victim of assassination . The policeman blew his whistle , and the slow procession of cars stopped as umbrellas bobbed across the street . Out of the corner of his eye , Nicoletcould see that the church was almost empty , only a few more left in line . Then , suddenly , he felt his hand seized in a cold , hard grip . " That old bitch ! " It was the boy who had given him a ride , his voice a fierce half-whisper . There was something cat-like about him , his pale eyes set wide apart , a faint feathering of blond whiskers at the cor/ners of his mouth . " They ought to ride her out of this town on a rail . " Then before Nicolet had time to answer , the boy sprang down the stairs followed by his two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets , his head ducked against the rain . Nicolet had followed him out onto the top step , and the last look that many of his departing parishionershad of him that morning was standing there with the starched lappets fluttering at his throat and his eyes narrowed against the rain . He loved the rain , alone would have tipped his face and opened his mouth to it . The sermon had been a failure , but it no longer much mattered because he knew in the rain again that the truth of it was true ; there was no part of the world untouched by joy . Even behind the boy 's queer violence a kind of wild joy had trembled . All that troubled Nicolet now was the suspicion that the violence was somehow his own doing , that the hate that for a moment he himself had felt for poor old Irma had shot out burning into the tinder of the boy 's heart.  |p238IT  ' S MAGIC . That 's why you have to sit on it . Otherwise it might go flying away without us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checkered table-cloth that was spread out on the grass , Roy had placed the picnic basket upside down with the children'ssandwiches and their cups of milk spread out on its flat bottom . He wanted them to use it as a table so that they would not spill so much and get grass stains on their shorts . They wanted to sit on the grass with everything in their laps . " This way , if it starts flying away , " he said , " it will take us with it . Wo n't that be dandy ? " " What 's dandy ? " Lizzie asked . " You talk funny . " It was Monday , Nicolet 's day off , and he had driven them to a meadow on the heights not far from the Vails ' house where behind them the land sloped up to where it looked like the outermost green edge of the world with the blue sky huge and cloudless behind it , in front of them sloped down to a barn andp239outbuildings beyond which you could see patches of sea . Nicolet had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the picnic . With Irma gone , Roy had made the sandwiches himself , taking the greatest pains with them . Ruining and throwing away a good deal of bread in the process , he had sliced each piece into two thin slices , cut off the crusts , and spread them with what seemed right to him for small children in springtime  --  quince jelly and cream cheese , deviled ham , watercress . Now he wanted them eaten right , he said , and picking Lizzieup under her arms , he set her down on the tableclothbeside the overturned basket . He was afraid for a moment that she was going to cry  --  her great unblinking eyes followed him slowly around to where Cornelia was picking a bouquet of yellow mustard and campion  --  but she did not cry . Seeing her grandfatherapproach , Cornelia went of her own accord and sat down beside her sister . " What does the magic table-cloth do ? " she asked . Roy used the full weight of his arm to press down on his beer can until finally with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with a delicate , beery mist . He wiped his face on his shirt sleeve and smiled . The second hole always came easier for some reason . " Oh , magic . . . You never know what it 's going to do or what 's going to do it or who it 's going to do it to . " He waved his beer can vaguely through the air , then took a long swallow from it . Cool and bitter ,  |p240it  stung his throat faintly and made his eyes water . " Sometimes the most everyday kinds of things turn out to have some magic in them . Old lamps . A rabbit'slittle hind foot with the fuzz on it . " " Maybe it will fly us away , " Cornelia said . " Maybe . There is never any sure way of telling . Eat up . " He lay down on his side with one elbow in the grass , his chin in his hand , and watched them . " Your teeth look like pits , " Lizzie said , her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up even higher than the birds can fly . Just think of that for a while , " he said , thinking of it himself . " Two little girls with yellow hair floating through the sky with their granddad as nice as you please and going up higher and higher and higher till the world does n't look any bigger than a nut . " " Tell us a story , " Cornelia said . " I am telling you a story . " " Pretend we 're flying now . " When they returned from church the day before , they had found Irma 's room empty . Her clothes were all gone . The bed was stripped . All that remained of her was the miniature pair of Indian moccasins hangingby the dresser mirror . She had left no message . Theo had called the few of her friends that he knew , but none of them had been able to tell him anything . Neither Grogan , nor Grogan 's stout , silent son who helped him out on weekends , had driven her anywhere . Theo was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever he could think of , but it was unlikely , Roy thought , that he would find anything . It was probably for the best . " Where are we flying to , then ? " Lizzie asked . He glanced at his youngest grandchild with curiosity . Towheaded , button-faced , she could not look less like a Nicolet yet the blood was in her , his blood , Leon 's blood , all the fox-like French faces in Leon 's plum-colored album ; what a rendezvous of ghosts a child was . Her upper lip was white with milk . " Some wonderful magic place , " he said . " The land of heart 's desire . The blessed isles . The happy hunting ground . " " What 's it like ? " The sun felt so hot on the top of his head that taking his handkerchief out of his pocket , he tied knots at each of the four corners and put it on like a cap . This was so much more interesting than a story that the children stopped asking questions and watched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front than in back so that it gave him an oddly rakish air . Once more he raised the beer can to his lips . " Well , " he said , " it 's a lot like this place where we are , I should n't wonder . There are green meadows and buttercups like this . The birds are always singing , and there are never any clouds except the pink ones and the golden ones that come when the sun starts going down . It 's the place where all the lost things are found . That 's the magic of it . Neverneverland . Everything that was ever lost since thep242world began turns up there in the end . And all the people who were ever lost turn up there in the end . " He felt a little light-headed ; beer on an empty stomach , he thought , and reached for a sandwich . " Pretend we 're there now , " Cornelia said . " First I 've got to get something on my stomach . " They watched him bite into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and except for the withery skin around his eyes , his face was white . Lying on one elbow , he had his face tilted sideways so that the sagging lower cheek seemed twice the size of the other . Cornelia wondered if she could achieve the same effect by tilting her head sideways but did not try because her grandfather was looking straight at her while he chewed . " We are there , " he said finally , having trouble swallowing so that his eyes bulged for an instant 's panic , then went back to dreaming as he finished off the last of the beer . " The magic table-cloth has landed , and here we are . Oh , children , children ! " He suddenlyflung his arm out wide . " Is n't it beautiful ? The land of heart 's desire . You see it ? Avalon . Watch them all come running over the hill through the green grass  --  all the lost children , the lost years ! " He pointed up to the swelling green brink of the world behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , a figure rose up over it and paused against the empty sky . It was Leon , his short military cape fluttering as he raised his good arm to wave down to them . From the way he stood , from thep243pitch of his shoulders , Roy could see the disappointmentheavy upon him , and after all , Roy thought , it was no wonder that he should be disappointed to find this old barber to be his only son , cringing in the grass with children and giddy on a single can of beer . But " Oh , you also disappointed me , Papa , " Roy thought . " You also disappointed me . " And although he did not want to smile , once he started he found that it was very hard indeed to stop . " Bluebeard ! " Cornelia shouted and ran up the slope toward her father , who picked her up and carried her down again as she undid the sweater that he had tied around his neck by the sleeves and hid her face in it . " Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She must still be in town somewhere . " " I wish I could have a hankie on my head like that , " Lizzie said wistfully to her grandfather . Lillian Flagg was in her back yard painting a picturewhen Rooney telephoned , and as soon as their conversation was finished , she returned to it . She meant simply to put it away for the day , take her canvas in out of the sun and close up her paints , but she found this impossible . She could not leave it as it was . Standing there in her bathing suit with her hair up in curlers , she stared at it through half-closed eyes . She moved a few steps farther away and bent over to see it upside down through her legs . She tookp244up her brush and with the point of its handle picked off an insect that had gotten gummed up in the wet , green pigment that she had used for the lawn . There was nothing wrong with the perspective that she could see , and by and large the colors seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite so chocolate a brown . With a little white on the tip of her brush , she modified this . The sky was better than her skies usually were . One plume of cloud came down too far and made it look as though it was coming out of the chimney , but she fixed that easily . It was only after she had stood there staring at it for some time longer that she decided that she knew what the trouble was . It was not that it did not look enough like what it was supposed to be but that it looked so much like nothing else . The house that she had done was only the house , her sky and trees were hopelessly sky and trees . The sharp slap of her hand to her bare shoulder was partly for the bug that had bitten her there , drawing blood , but more for this tediously accurate lie that she had told with her tidy little brushes . Mixing some lavender and thinning it to a wash , she swept it back and forth above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a jagged hole in one corner of the sky where she put in what might have been a star or a white bird . Marvelousthings happened to the pine that rose above the roof from behind , the branches folding down like dark wings , and with her palette knife she spread
