The Virgin Islands used to be the place to forget about the factory . The sand is white , the weather right , the pleasures plentiful-and a Pan Am tourist book even advises women visi tors to leave their girdles at home . Now industry is coming to the Virgins , and the results so far are unsettling to many of the islands ' 36,000 year-round residents . <P> In the vanguard are 57 small manufacturing companies drawn to the Virgins since 1957 by a favorable tariff concession : merchandise moves into the U.S. duty-free if 50% of the cost of processing it was spent in the islands . Seven watch companies-including subsidiaries of Hamilton and Benrus-assemble movements from Japanese , French , Moroccan and even Russian parts that are imported at the Virgins ' low 6% tariff rate . Other companies process shoelaces , textiles , pens and medical thermometers . Old-line sugar planters complain that they can no longer get cane cutters at 600 an hour while the new factories pay $1.15 , and housewives cry that the monthly cost of maid service has inflated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor Ralph Paiewonsky , however , is after bigger business . He offers a ten-year corporate tax forgiveness and other come-ons that have blown up a storm of protest . Many islanders objected when Paiewonsky agreed to pay $3,000,000 to Harvey Aluminum for dredging a ship channel near a $25 million alumina plant that it is building on the island of St. Croix . To critics Paiewonsky snaps : " We do n't want suitcase industry that comes in and takes tax concessions for ten years and then runs out . Heavy industry is what we need . " <P> In the biggest fight of all , Paiewonsky is trying to shift the islands ' agriculture out of sugar cane-which is raised on 155 mostly small , uneconomical estates - and into citrus and other higher cash crops . Over protests of the sugar growers , Paiewonsky is urging the federally run Virgin Islands Corp . to close the islands ' one creaky sugar mill . " Vicorp " itself is negotiating a long-term lease of 1,700 acres of government-owned and money-losing sugar fields to Big Industrialist Daniel K. Ludwig ( TIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for frozen juice then blend one part Virgin Islands juice with nine parts of juice from his plantations in Panama ; the higher cost of juice from the islands , plus the cost of canning it , would add up to 50% of the total and enable the mixed juice to move to the U.S. duty-free . <P> Live on Liquor . Now that industry is arriving , the islands seem less paradisaical . But then , there has always been a little trouble in paradise . Because almost everything has to be imported from the U.S. mainland , living costs are expensive-except for goodies that are brought in to the islands ' free port to woo the tourists . Says one newly arrived businessman : " Only the luxuries are cheap . If you could live on liquor , cigarettes and perfume , you 'd have it made in the Virgins . "
