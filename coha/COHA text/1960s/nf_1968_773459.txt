txt // stratification in the United States . Typical of such mistakes is the overemphasis on habits of consumption . It is true that the superordinate groups have more " taste " than do the subordinate , but that probably means that they have more funds and leisure to develop such things . The present point is that standards of consumption may be status symbols , or even emblems of power , but the symbol without the power is meaningless . A powerful person may prefer traditional furniture to Swedish functional , but that fact alone does not enable him to make someone do something disagreeable . " Keeping up with the Joneses " may be just a kind of self-inflicted misery , or a system of amusing one 's self . Who are the Joneses ? Old King John was so mad at the Welsh that he made all he could catch drop their own names , like Evan ap Gwyneth , and take his own royal one , which the victims thought sounded like Jones . Snobbery is characteristic of democracies , not of aristocracies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , high or low , is secure and well recognized . Of a similar nature is the place of the family residence . Symbiosis is a true test of stratification , to be sure , and the powerful do tend to live in the same area . Those dispossessed of status are indeed forced into slums . Moving into a " good " neighborhood is a present American technique of social climbing , but much of modern talk revolves around the snobbishness just mentioned . It may well be that those who live in a certain area of a city dominate those in another , but it is the superordination which counts , not the address per se . Priority of residence , or the superordination of the firstcorners , is another American idea . The " old " families of England are surely Celtic and Anglo-Saxon in contrast with the armed Norman immigrants . The noblesse of Belgium were nobles of the Empire and more often bear non-Walloon names than not . The South Italian nobility are the descendents of Robert Guiscard 's Norman ruffians . The deference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the descendents of colonial British , French , and Spanish still have an advantage . The foregoing hint of quasiritualization of status hints that a clique may become something stronger . What if nonmembers defer to it and strive for membership in the Jones-admiring manner ? If this happens , a clique may be on its way to becoming a little class . It is characteristic of many cliques to seek power . They are the seedbed of plotting . If they succeed in secret , they become power structures . If their success is in the open , they become little classes , or subclasses . It is a mistake to think that a social class must cover an entire society . Sociocultural categories subject to the pressure from above are given to clique formation . Armies , therefore , are full of them for this reason . Indeed , having suffered humiliation and nothing else since Waterloo , the magnificent French Army was particularly given to cliques . Eventually these can become subclasses and power structures among the elite troops . The United States Army is far from free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echelons . If a clique of enlisted men decides to make their captain " look bad " by " goofing off , " the next time the colonel or general comes around for an inspection , this can be done . Again , if clique members succeed in having their children intermarry , we come again to the appearance of power . Ordinarily this effort of succession fails , but if it succeeds and certain blocks of stock or acres of land come together and are kept there , the clique yields to a class . A clique ceases to be just that if it takes a name . It then becomes an association , a subject to be discussed in Chapter 17 . The well placed have such satisfaction in their cliques that they seem to scorn associations . The less fortunate but not abject , seemingly nostalgic for the old primary days , have a strong tendency to join named associations and wear buttons in their lapels . The clique itself is a means of personality satisfaction and is therefore functional to its membership and dysfunctional to no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure is functional to its own , but can be quite something else to outsiders . A foreman seeing such a thing develop , and a first sergeant , too , had best keep an eye on their men . The best insulation against this is to make official authority acceptable and to see that its ritualization is emotionally satisfying . Proceeding now to stronger and more powerful structures , it may be well to consider the superordination of some men over others . The types of stratified systems discussed from now on , whatever else they may be , represent the power of one group over other persons and not some mildly paranoid collection of personalities grouped into some Jonesian clique . **29;163;TOOLONG must be considered in terms of power , open or covert , mild or harsh , legitimate or illicit . If this is ritualized and out in the open , at least in part , one is observing a class , estate , or a caste . Complete secrecy as a fact or an ambition converts the group into a power structure . Classes , estates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Power structures try to have none at all which their out-groups can see , but rigid ones operating in the in-group . Effort should be and usually is made to condition all pertinent people to these norms . We know that self-discipline is the only trustworthy kind , and it is the problem of every social system in the world to induce the child to want to do what it has to do . None of us is ever completely tamed to any power pattern , as Freud tried to teach us . No human is completely socialized . Every eye to whom these pages may come has at times flared with rebellion and resentment . The id has only been driven underground , not slain . At certain fortunate times this indwelling rebellion can be systematized into readjusting the dysfunctional in a social system . Sometimes it leads to crime , neurosis , and other deviance . More often , caught as most of us are , it leads to the potential rebel taking it out on himself in psychosomatic disorders which may even kill . A wise , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // ordination will provide an adequate ataractic culture as discussed in Part IV , and we have little reason to be very proud of our current solutions of the problem . Granted that there is no positively known natural base for the domination of man by man , we will accept for the time being that both authority and power are artificialities in the sense used in this book . They both refer to techniques for getting work done , for accomplishing the social task , for obtaining goals recognized as functional for someone , either the system as a whole , or for the recognizable segments thereof . As goals increase and expand due to the so-far unprobed capacity of men to want , the cultural means for achieving them increase . This , as we have noted , requires social organization , system , and structure . This is the cultural , not natural , root of the need for some persons to have power to originate action to others . Every person , or a sufficient number of them , in order to accomplish the task , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perform , and what his status in those roles is to be . It is not necessary that every actor in a simple system know why he is required to do certain things . It is not essential that the peasant know why he is to plow in a certain way . The goal is a sufficient food supply for everyone . As the culture becomes more and more complex , it becomes necessary for this peasant to know more about what and why . It was not formerly necessary for the individual soldier to see " the big picture , " or even for subordinate officers to have this knowledge of how the victorious goal is to be accomplished . It is now . The goal is always paramount , and one of the chief techniques for achieving it is for some to originate to others . This undoubtedly goes against the grain of most of us , so it is necessary that this power be institutionalized . Power should be ritualized if it is expected that all actors know what they should do . We are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority . Lucky is that social system wherein power and authority are synonymous . Authority is out in the open . Its norms are written , or at least explainable by the written word . Men can adjust to it . They know where they are in respect to it and can submit themselves to it , rebel , or leave the social system . Authority can be taught . It can become a conditioned re sponse , on both the orders and obedience aspects . It is order , system , and structure . As a conditioned response , authority in one system can often be transferred to another . The Confederacy , for example , had a weak central government and an almost unbelievable ignorance of logistics ( supply ) . The Army of the Tennessee , for example , is called by European experts the best army ever to wear shoe leather , and it almost survived an incredibly in competent high command . Yet this , and other Confederate armies , kept in the field and more times than not were successful over their opponents in specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ac customed to authority , and their opponents had to learn this in the field . Authority can be learned , then , but can raw power be taught ? Every social // system must try to reconcile these by formalizing and ritualizing power into authority , which is the official structure . The rituals of authority can be written or spoken so all can understand them . They protect both the superordinate and the subordinate . Thus , a military commander exercises vast power over his subordinates , telling them when and what they shall eat , when they can stand up and when they can sit , and when and where they shall die or be grievously injured . This power is always ritualized into some normative code , The Manual for Courts Martial , the Queen 's Regulations , or by whatever the polity may name it . There are limits beyond which the commander can not go if he wants an army instead of a mob of armed servants . Even the humblest private can , by theory , prefer court martial charges against h , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get it , which is a dread process . Although he does not seem to know it , every American military person may request a psychiatric examination of his superior and get it . Someone will be moved after this , the appellant or the commander . The ritualizing of power into authority sets limits and tells us what to do . Even a harsh code represents system , while none at all produces turbulence . There seems , however , an inherency in ritual to proliferate to the point where it gets in its own way , to increase function by simple linear development so that dysfunction will catch up . The more the power to be exercised , the more complex ritual tends to become . A hyperceremonial pattern may remain long after real power has departed because of its emotional content . It represents order . It takes virtually a whole day to crown a British king , a person provided with no comfort and laden with ponderous robes . This sovereign , though , is almost always in the " prime of life . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been elderly for centuries . All this ceremonial is merely emblemizing what was or is vast power . Norms of formality , in our search for system , then , may become so cumbersome that when turbulence , anomia , and disequilibrium appear , doubt may exist as to who is going to provide relief . There are times when good men , not rebels against authority , need help , not red tape , or hyperritualism . The English kings saw this long ago and set up the court of the Lord Chancellor which was empowered to cast away the rules of law for those of justice , and that immediately . This court has now become the most ritual laden , cumbersome court in the realm . Read Charles Dickens ' novel Bleak House . It is in such cases that regression sets in , that power begins to separate out of formal authority . This is de facto , covert revolution . Let us call it what it is . Only the simple think that revolutions are always from below . Let no one conclude that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read these pages has been loyal to principles which he had to compromise some time or other , or thought he must . It might have given him a psychosomatic sickness , but he did it . All adults know that compromise is the rule of life . Even compromise with principles may itself // be ritualized . For example , the absolute stricture of the Roman Catholic Church on divorce and remarriage is well known . The court of the Sacred Rota exists in Rome to make compromises with it , however , if one has the wealth to hire a corps of canon lawyers and time to wait for years for relief . Thus , in the early part of this century the Duke of Westminster successfully pleaded before the Rota that he did not believe in the sacramental character of marriage when he espoused a lady and had children by her . As one can not enter into a sacrament without believing it , the marriage was therefore void from the beginning and never was in effect , the rules of state and childbirth to the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board , divortium a mensa et thoro , but absolute separation from the bonds of matrimony , divortium a vinculo matrimonii , with permission to remarry , which , in this case , was exercised . The chancellor of every American diocese of the Episcopal Church will tell you that he , as the ecclesiastical judge , is worked overtime with such causes . Now adults do not scorn this , for they know that compromises have to be made , and if they can be effected in an orderly manner , so much the better . Those who can not see this have such inflexible personalities that poor mental health may be the price . The problem is , where is the threshold between safety and turbulence ? Where is the point of no return with an individual compulsive liar and the same thing in government ? We do not know the answer , and we have not tried to learn , although historical and modern events show one social system after another going down because there was too little truth in them . The foregoing introduction to power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called a " power structure . " This is always a very strong organization , for it only has two alternatives , strength or death . Those living in Western Civilization are tempted to think that power structures exist only in societies similar to their own , but it is reasonable that whenever the official norm-authority pattern fails to keep up with the require ments of the technology , unofficial leadership will take over . This tendencv of the material culture to progress ahead of the normative was called " the cultural lag " by William Fielding Ogburn , and many of those who laughed at the hypothesis have lived to be ruled by it . If the words informal leadership imply triviality , lack of real power , and absence of structure , this impression can be tragically mistaken . When one observes that informal leadership may often be equated with " the power structure , " or " the Establishment , " " the Organization , " " the Machine , " or " the Ring , " the implication of triviality vanishes . Such structures are actu ally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public , for they are not the official rituals of authority . The rituals of the power structure may be even more exacting than those of authority , which terms are far from synonyms . There are unofficial persons to see if one wants the state to act in his behalf . Even an anthropological field party can accomplish less than it should by relying on the official authority , not the real power . // This last sentence denies that " wheeling and dealing " is confined to civilized societies . For example , the Kutenai Indian chieftainships were a fairly authoritative system of roles and statuses even before acculturation set in , and they were not made less so by the officials of the United States Indian Service and those of British Columbia . Chief Aeneas Kustata was in 1935 chief of the Tobacco Plains band of Kutenai in southeastern British Columbia , and a lovable , venerable person he was . The power , however , had lapsed into the hands of Ignatius Jack . It may well be that unofficial leadership patterns especially flourish in democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pliable candidate or even a puppet may be presented to the electorate . Similar situations may exist in monarchies and autocracies , however , and if the official and often sacred head of state weakens , the power structure may seize absolute power . The head butler , or Mayor of the Palace , held the real power in the waning Frankish Empire , and the Mikado of Japan became a creature in the hands of the Tokugawa family who made themselves hereditary prime ministers . The unofficial power structure may function even under strong rulers . Caesar , of course , can cure all wrongs , but whom does one see in order to get his petition before the emperor , before Louis XIV , or before the most powerful person the world has ever known , the president of the United States ? Who has seized , or been given , the power to present and to withhold ? If one aspires to take over the power at the weakening of the official autocrat , however , be sure that the old rattlesnake really is feeble . Aging seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his business . He withdrew more and more to his villa on the isle of Capri and according to his enemies , into recreational activities which ought not be described . Seeing this , one Piso formed a clique which virtually took over Rome . The plot of his little band of devoted senators came to the emperor 's ear , and at the next meeting of the senate , guess who was there to preside ? Tiberius , of course , and surrounded by a host of loyal troops . What happened to Piso and friends would sicken a Gestapo commander . Power structures flourish in local affairs , too , especially if the official authority is spatially or ritually distant . People need help , and will reward with power those who really maintain their equilibria . Thus , an English rural community is really governed by the squire , the vicar , and the publican . The squire may be the official justice of the peace , or he may not be . Official authority rests in the local police constable and perhaps other officials , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the owner of the tavern are friends , the power will rest in this little three . If they do not get along , it is best for a stranger and some natives to move . If they stand together , touch one , touch all three , for good or for evil . Nowhere is this unofficial , informal leadership more patent than in the rural South . A stranger coming into the community may say that he wishes to sell brushes , encyclopedias , set up a trailer camp near gexxl fishing , // causing suspicion , as they are not famous as yet . They should be given the job of sponsoring new ideas , especially good ones for the clientele as a whole . It is unwise for the seniors to do this , for if the public should take an animus to the proposition , or should the opposition make hay out of it , the idea can be renounced without damaging one of the seniors . The junior may hide in obscurity until his connection with the idea is forgotten . This will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones may learn the ins and outs of the prominent corporations and associations , labor unions in particular , without which a power structure can not long survive . The senior members of both the corporations , unions , and the structure may be the best of friends , but this friendship does not supply the detail needed . Such knowledge must also be provided regarding the chief tangential institutions , religious and educational especially . Scandal is a menace to any organization . A friendly press can only go so far , for rumor , sometimes real news , can spread by word of mouth . Junior members who can not keep their records clean must be removed , preferably by getting them good jobs far away . It hardly needs saying , in addition to the moral strictures mentioned at the beginning of this discussion , that alliance with the underworld is most unwise . Like all mercenaries , heads of gangs and syndicates have such a way of moving in that they control the power structure . These people have great blackmail power , and unfavorable information secretly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one outside the state , can be devastating . Association of junior members with the " characters " is dangerous . The same may be said of " petty graft . " Favors are one thing , but graft in visible property can be explosive . A reporter of an opposition newspaper took what seemed a casual photograph of a state university truck delivering publicly owned building material to a favored private friend . This appeared in the news the next day , and information came tumbling in . The university president served time in the state penitentiary , and it took years for the structure to rebuild , if it ever has . If a client needs such pettifogging help , and asks for it , get rid of him . He can not be of much use , and he is a constant menace . The promotion of junior members constitutes a real problem . The able must be promoted in any organization , or they will quit , often with valuable information in their memories . A wise top level structure takes cognizance of aging and replacement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this is not so true on any state level . Power is hard to let go , especially for the senile . Chapter 28 of this book will indicate that mental senility may set in years before it is physically apparent . A structure of unofficial leadership maintains itself by performance , and bumbling can do real damage . One ought not close this discussion of the power structure without mentioning the distaff side . It is almost necessary that the organization have friends and supporters among the able matrons . This is no condescending // " women 's auxiliary , " but a volunteer group of highly intelligent older women . The mature women of a social system constitute a category which it is most unwise to antagonize , so it is wise to have female allies . Saint Paul offended the power structure of Ephesus , but it was not until he had infuriated the " devout and honorable matrons " that he had to leave town , in this case being lowered over the walls in a basket with Saint Barnabas handling the rope . The English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans . They know that it is wise to bind the rising juniors to The Establishment by the ties of marriage , childbirth , and party giving . Marriage even to the less endowed daughters flatters the rising juniors and helps keep them in line . Should they prove unsuccessful , they can be shunted somewhere in the hinterland and given sinecures . A man and his wife can even be useful there . Their party giving can be the source of considerable goodwill in the community . The feudal nobility and the criminal syndicate lords have always understood this better than has the state power structure . The term popularity contest is sometimes used with reference to personal rule , and in this generation the cult of personality is very important . As modern man is more and more circumscribed by the faceless bureaucracy , he is increasingly demanding a charming , warm hero as the official chief of state . He can see and hear this man , especially since the invention of television . He can not see and hear either the bureaucrats or the leaders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief . The cult of personality is a neutral thing . The charming and personable may be efficient , able , dedicated , and honest . He may be the reverse of any or all of these values . The cult of personality is not new . It is very old and has a record of mismanagement and success . It is nevertheless here and important . Personal rule through charm may be very efficient . It may be extremely dysfunctional . In order to avoid modern emotions , let us mention one unpopular king of England . He was an extremely able general . He was intelligent , perceptive , and an able administrator . He tried to set up the central government as the just rule his country needed . He tried to keep his nation from the encroachments of the papacy . He put down banditry so that people could roam the realm in safety . He was parsimonious of the public wealth , although he enjoyed a few fine things as ornaments . He lived in his country and for it . He was unfortunately homely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His personal life was controlled and impeccable . He failed , and his name is a loathing to this day . That name was King John . The one the English loved was the opposite of all of these . He failed so much as a general that he spent much of his time as a prisoner . He was no administrator at all , so had to bleed every manor he controlled to maintain his extravagant court , made more expensive by the doxies he kept around him . He was so poor a patriot that he visited England as little as need be , and then only to collect something . I pis name was King Richard , and his people still worship him as the Heart of a Lion . I le just about had the brain of one , too . // Indirect rule , or unofficial power structure , has the same functional problems to solve as any other system , indeed , even more so , for it must succeed . It has no hoary , emotion-laden symbols to protect it . Remember that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unconstitutional one . The service and equilibrium of a social system is the fundamental goal , and no ruler , class , or power structure can survive without recognizing this . Danger is always inherent in both rule by personality and unofficial power structure . Both are fundamentally revolutions without facing up to the necessary changes in ritual and norms . Anomia of the clientele is almost sure to appear , for the unconstitutional rulers insist on norm obedience by the members of the system which they themselves must and do violate . Public role with secret status is a fragmentation dangerous to all concerned . It does us little good to point out that an unofficial power structure may be more efficient , more considerate of the social system , do more " good " and perhaps be less venal than official authority . Power may flow away from the bureaucrat to the politician , and more people may be better served than they would otherwise be . Power structures almost always start out as champions of the people . There is a problem , however , a danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constant threat to the clientele , and eventually , to the structure itself . Who dares deny Lord Acton 's dictum that power corrupts , and absolute power corrupts absolutely ? That every such organization must at times operate under one set of norms publicly and another in private contains an inherent danger of dealing fundamentally in deceit , a covert denial of reality . Leave aside value judgments such as " truth , " as no one has yet answered the query of Pontius Pilate on the subject and speak of reality . Reality for us refers to what we can discover with our limited techniques , or what we can comprehend with the nervous systems we have inherited . It is the fundamental task of man to adjust to reality and to manipulate it when he can do so to his own advantage . So instead of values like truth and falsity , let us speak of reality , partial reality , and recognized unreality . Every adult personality also knows in what direction the cultural efforts of man , including social systems , must go , wherein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does expediency become Actonian corruption ? To what extent may we permit the cynical on the one hand and the paranoid on the other to rule us ? The question is asked again , where is the threshold when system becomes antisystem ? Clique , power structure , estates , and caste , all these have existed from time to time and from place to place , but many societies have never known any of them . Social classes are something else . Weak or strong , simple or cony plex , their universality among all recorded peoples suggests a kind of inevitability . We must now devote our efforts to analyzing this phenomenon , a far from simple one as the dispassionate data at hand are neither quantity lively nor qualitatively adequate . First among all considerations and the // ultimate test of the existence of a class is the **29;194;TOOLONG of persons , the power of some to originate action to others outside the kinship with a certain expectable conformity . True , all of this was encountered in the foregoing discussion of power structures , but deep differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part illicit , while a class is likewise always in part legitimate . One of the most serious mistakes of the American people was to deny the existence of class , or if forced to do so , to splatter reality with the paint of illegitimacy . True , the great American state documents have never said this , but the continuation of the eighteenth century ideology of egalitarianism needed to accomplish the American revolution has led and will lead to unbearable rioting in the streets . Second , needing all sorts and conditions of men to accomplish its goals , a power structure has little homogeneity . It transacts with intense primary behavior on each echelon , but keeps each stratum separate by strict secondary behavior . A class , be it of high or low status , is remarkably homogeneous or it will cease to exist . And last , while relying on exacting rituals within its own ranks , the power structure pretends that no rituals exist . A class relies on such rituals as techniques of social distance , overt or subtle . It dies when its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the widespread agreement that social classes rest upon that division of labor which is universal in human societies and that the sorting of roles and statuses is based on that division , it is extremely hard to conceptualize just what is under discussion . There are virtually no satisfactory definitions of " class , " including the one offered below . The internalized biases of the authors and researchers are too often apparent , and there is too little practical consensus among students as to what is being studied . This remark is not as critical as it seems , for like any other subject of study which is in fact a continuum , it is easier to define the hard-core center and ignore the people who blur into the next category . The following definition , vague because it must include much , is offered more for criticism and debate than instruction . It is suggested , then , that a social class is a subsystem of a society consisting of an indeterminate number of personalities considered as social positions who may or must originate or terminate action with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise , definitely or vaguely , consider themselves as an in-group and be regarded by others as an out-group whose position may be enforced with ritual and sanction . It must be kept in mind that this chapter is discussing social system and that all stratification , class included , represents subsystem within a superorganization . All such strata are working phenomena with functions and goals deemed useful to the supersystem . Parenthetically , one must observe that a class , subordinate or superordinate , may lose some of its functions , or all of them , and be replaced in either its upper or lower positions by a rival . The loss of military command as a monopoly and the modern increasing agricultural efficiency which has all but destroyed their bottle neck position // as the controllers of the food economy has virtually obliterated the traditional upper class . For that matter , what Lewis Mumford and others call The Managerial Revolution has almost made the capitalists , as the traditional upper middle class , a memory . Large corporations , and they are the source of the rising standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but by hired executives and bureaucrats . Whether these latter have deliberately manipulated the international inflation , local inheritance , personal income , and capital gains taxes to destroy the owning class is a matter of interesting controversy . Nor need one confine such loss to the formerly superordinated classes . There is little need for the traditional lower class any more . Machines and a growing automation have made " common " labor a thing of the past , and no one has yet devised new roles and statuses for those able to contribute no more . A classless society , however , is no society at all , or one which will be destroyed by turbulence unless a new homeostatic system is achieved . The existence of a class does not depend on its size . One ordinarily thinks of a class as coterminous with a supersystem , but that is not necessarily so . While this may be rare it is also possible for a class to have only local validity and still not be a subclass of a supersystem . Power , recognition , ritual , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused much confusion in the descriptive literature . For example , it is unthinkable that what is described as upper class in Plainville , U.S.A. be considered such in Yankee City , and certainly not in Charleston or New Orleans . This leads one to ask about the number of classes he can expect in a society . This is a question that can not be answered in general . One must understand the pertinent economy and technology . There are never less than two , the patricians and the plebs . Division of labor after Metal Age thresholds have been crossed will destroy this simplicity , and a strong tendency for a three class society will make itself felt . It has become a tradition of American social anthropology and sociology to cite a three class division , with a three subclass subdivision in the major strata . The influence of this system is apparent in this book , which consistently uses upper upper , lower middle , and so on , but the current rapid change in American life makes it seem unwise to ask the reader to memorize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its mold . For example , there is a feeling that what writers using this system call the " lower lower " constitute no class at all , but describe the declasses , the unclassed who contribute little to the social system but problems . These are the Lumpenproletariat of Karl Marx which every society contains and for which no system has ever taken adequate preventive or rehabilitative measures . Classes are often classified in terms of accessibility , recruitment , and succession as " open class " and " closed class . " These are ideal terms , for no really practical boundaries have ever been drawn . An open class is accessible to all those able to enter it and is one willing and able to eject its incompetent members into lower ones . It is a coldly rational structure . Actually , an // open class revolves almost exclusively around the economic power of production , consumption , and distribution and can not carry much dead wood with it . Its rituals are rational rather than emotional and are therefore kept at a minimum . A closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will receive members from another , but such admission and recognition is difficult to obtain . Thus , in the first two decades of this century sociologists customarily described American society as an open class system , but deemed the British system one based on the closed class method of recruitment . A closed class , of course , loves to deck itself with either the trappings of power or the ritual justification and rationalization of status . It therefore attracts a homogeneous membership in its upper , middle , and lower aspects . Every social class of whatever type , however , has work to do , power to seek and retain , and this requires a homogeneity of purpose . If it is an economic class , the functional relationship between parts must be revised whenever they seem to fail . An economic class will resist invasion except on its own terms of recruitment , especially from the tangent systems of religion and politics . A superordinate economic class will try to control these tangent systems if it can , and in any event , will struggle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of greater ritualization and restricted accessibility , one comes to the estate system of stratification . The boundaries between closed classes and estates are hard to draw , if indeed they are valid at all . The usual distinction is that an estate is recognized by law . It is openly ritualized , while a class is far less so . That , of course , is a distinction of degree . It is our legal theory that everyone is equal before the law , and this is very often a courtroom fact as well as a legal theory . Nevertheless , a class can not long exist without legal bolstering . A second requirement of an estate is that it shall be strictly hereditary , which is also a matter of degree . If , for example , anyone wanting to learn how to lay bricks in a closed shop American city thinks that this is not controlled by an almost hereditary trade union , let him try to enter the craft . One suspects that some writing on the estate system has been done by those attracted or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor nobility is confined to that continent . Again , some analysts , impressed by the difficulty of upward social mobility in the feudal social system , have overlooked the ease with which one could fall . The law of entail held the title to land and status intact for the older son . As nobles are a remarkably fertile folk , what happened to the other sons ? There were monasteries , which were sterilizing , and the upper secular clergy as well . There was mercenary service under strangers as " knights errant , " to quote the euphemism . There was military service in the Templars and Hospitallers , which killed off the sprigs of nobility by the thousands . But then there was just plain downward movement into the lower estates , the one taken by younger son , Richard Whittington , who left his hereditary sword and became an apprentice and successful London " huckster . " Now , if estates do indeed exist and the position of this book agrees // with the majority that they do , the analyst might have to look just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the time being , however , let us agree on those two characteristics of classification , accepting as well the current preoccupation with the nobility . Accepting these , the estate system represents an extreme in stability . It seems to be a response to great instability in both the external and internal relations systems , and especially with relation to the basic human requirements of food and survival . The key to both was control of qualitative space , or land . At the beginning of West Europe 's mediaeval period , the lower orders flocked around the armed man who thought he was the Roman baro ( regimental commander ) and helped him beat back the barbarians . Many formerly free men gladly surrendered their rights for protection , and escape from the late Roman taxation system made local feudalism seem attractive . Once settled , rights were guaranteed and duties exacted . It is impossible to outline just what these were for feudal Europe as a whole . The relations of baron and man differed with every manor and with many subclasses upon the same manor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And what was money ? The lord collected food lavishly from his dependents and spent it in the same way . Food , drink , and display , and everyone was welcome except the sovereign , if any , who ate the place out of castle and home . Once settled , people knew who and what they were , and feudalism was a masterpiece of system even if cultural change was thereby slowed down , or so it is alleged . Pre-Columbian America was far from exempt from estate formation . All Indians who achieved the political state , with perhaps the exception of the Iroquois republic and probably the late Cherokee priest-kingship , had estate systems . The Natchez provide us with an example of extreme ritualization of absolute , hereditary , publicly recognized ( legal ) status positions . Theirs was a three estate , monarchical society . The top of the pyramid was occupied by a priest-king called The Sun , mythically a relative of that heavenly body . Below him were great nobles called Suns . Next in rank were the gentry , or Honored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who did most of the work , called Stinkards . This was a highly ritualized society . Emotional outlet and social climbing were provided by the fact that everyone had to marry a Stinkard . Integration was achieved by the fact that everyone , no matter how humble , was " kinsfolk " with everyone above . In this matrilineal society daughters of such unions took their mothers ' position , while sons took one step downward . Everyone had to approach the next higher order by crawling towards them on the ground . Even Suns had to wriggle up the mound to address The Sun . How humiliating it must have been for a Stinkard husband to have to slither towards his Sun wife to ask permission for time off to play chunkee and drink persimmon beer with " the boys . " The algebraically inclined will sec that the Natchez system would // eventually run out of Stinkards . The problem was partly solved by capturing whole social systems of the less well organized , Creeks , for instance , and giving them the choice of becoming Natchez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner . The Natchez system would have conquered the whole Southeast had their birth rates held up to their casualties . Not much military effectiveness could be expected of Creek draftees . One had to be conditioned to the system . There is an important point here . Persons conditioned to similar roles and statuses appreciate and enjoy each other across the lines of social systems and even major societies . Thus , it is doubtful if one can stand at the foot of the French guillotine or sit in MacDonald 's Parliament in the 1920 's and say , " Well , that 's that ! No more estates . " If so , the hypothesis of telestic inherency , that there are but few ways to solve recurrent social problems of organization , is fundamentally unsound , and that is not proven . The implication that estates are European phenomena will not bear up even if one takes the foregoing interpretation of them as truly classifying . The feudal system was legally established in French Canada , Netherlands New York , and in the proprietary colonies of Maryland and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution and would never have submitted to that document had they thought it forbade their existence . The great western cattle " barons , " with their wars against the Old People ( Indians ) , their contempt for peasants ( hoe farmers ) , their sense of hospitality and honor , their feudal wars against each other with their esquires ( foremen ) , sergeants ( cowboys ) , and mercenaries ( hired guns ) , enjoyed the possibilities for a few years . All these American expressions were killed by the same phenomenon that slew the European higher estates and brought the Japanese daimyo ( lords ) and their samurai ( knights ) to heel , the growth of strong central governments . Here is one key to the understanding of the estate . The upper estates will control the government , or the latter will destroy the former . It is therefore proposed that closed classes became estates under the impact of that rising nationalism which destroyed the unity of European man founded by old Rome and saved in remnant by Christianity and feudalism . Surely it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , churchmen , journeymen craftsmen , serfs excluded , wandered all over Europe in the high Middle Ages , with only language barriers providing a difficulty which was partly overcome by the common knowledge of vulgar Latin . Is that not true today , whenever the law allows and sometimes when it does not ? Is it not true that the " loyalty " and " patriotism " of persons transacting across societal boundaries but along those of interest , power , and consciousness of kind is just a little suspect ? Is , then , the estate system an historical curio , something which can not happen again ? Close the book on the knightly trappings which have impressed some writers , and say an estate is a relatively closed class that can interact and transact across the boundaries of whole societies , and what do // we see ? British capital owned and controlled vast blocks of securities in this country , which influence was liquidated by Britain 's indebtedness for World War I. French investments in eastern Europe were so heavy that when they were wiped out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never recovered . Since the second world war , Japanese corporations sell freely in every fair sized American city , and " foreign " cars crowd the highways . The penetration of American business into Europe is a cause of much hubbub . Is this transaction ? Can not one speak of homogeneity of interests , of structure and strength , and the legitimacy of enforceable contracts ? Rituals ? Well , only rational ones so far . The hereditary principle ? There are those who write about the inheritance of blocks of cartel stocks , influence , and power . Coats of arms and banners ? Power is better , is it not ? A true historical curio is found in the next and last ritualized stratification , the caste , the one which by theory recruits only by sexual reproduction . It is really an occupational grouping and like an estate is a modus vivendi to restrict transaction by trades and crafts which might disrupt each other . Rural India , the only part of the world which has the caste system in the pure , has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systematization of its action . The traditional four major castes of India , the brahmins ( priests and scholars ) at the top , the kshatriyas ( rulers and soldiers ) next below , the vaishyas ( traders and merchants ) following , and the sudras ( peasants and servants ) at the bottom , are subdivided into a vast number of subcastes , depending on locality . Here again , we speak of an ideal . The landowning caste , of course , does not wish to associate with the cultivator , but how can it get the farming done without transacting with the menials ? It can not , but it tries its best to do this with thorough formal mechanisms . ' Theoretically , a caste system makes no provision for upward mobility . This ideal is held sufficiently so that today caste members " look alike . " They are really gene pools , for caste endogamy tends , therefore , to produce racial types . Perhaps caste restrictions were once regulated by law , but this has not been necessary for centuries . They have such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their spiritual significance is so great in modern India that the caste system is resisting modern reforms on the lower as well as on the higher levels . A caste in fact represents the spiritual or moral virtue of an occupation . Theologically , one is born into a caste because of the life he led in another existence . Rebellion against one 's humble lot is dampened by belief that he can so amass virtue in this role that he will be born into a high caste at the next incarnation . Karma , or the Hindu theory of causation of things as they are through moral action in the past , is system and is emotionally satisfying . If this is to be destroyed , something of value must be put in its place . Consideration of the foregoing pages might tempt a reader to think // that , apart from that open class system which likes to speak of its democracy , the closed class , estate , and caste systems are much more restrictive than they are or ever were . This impression must be corrected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobility , in spite of what the norms of a rigid system may say . There are almost always overt or covert methods by which a person , family , or other group may rise in the system . These have not very fortunately been called " techniques of social climbing . " The misfortune lies in the value judgment with which " social climbing " has been invested . There is or should be no invidious implication in this term , as almost every undergraduate student unto whom these presents may come is using his college or university years as a technique of social climbing or status reinforcement . The American normative system has from colonial days considered an open class system the national goal , in which it is commendable to rise from skilled labor to white collar , from white collar into the administrative and junior executive strata . This can hardly be done in these days without a baccalaureate diploma . The form that social climbing techniques take must , of course , follow the lines of the value system cherished by the particular society . Promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in societies suffering instability in either its internal or external relations . Even the rigidly class stratified Kwakiutl Indians of Vancouver Island permitted a baseborn man to rise into the military aristocracy by the performance of great deeds of valor . Counting coups , or the acquisition of highly ceremonial war honors , was almost the only method of rising into the band council in the two class system of the Plains Indians . The son of the most abject mediaeval serf could , by hanging around the castle and learning what he could , gain enough military knowledge to become a man-at-arms , in other words , an armed servant , or sergeant ( Lat. serviens , one who serves ) . Very many of these were eventually incorporated into the lower upper class as esquires , or as the French say , the little nobility ( petite noblesse ) . More than one such family acquired land and title in a few generations . War brings opportunity to " new " men . A Mr. Haig , a successful distiller , had a grandson who died The Earl Haig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generals in World War I. The English have a way of demoting their " temporary gentlemen " when peace comes , but the United States has a little of this as well . An American general officer is listed ex officio in Who 's Who in America , and a war swells this volume . These soldiers revert to their permanent rank when peace comes , and Who 's Who promptly drops them . A bound peasant 's descendent rose to the rank of sergeant in the old French army and became a marshal under Napoleon . Whatever estate system norms we may retain , money getting is always useful . The nouveaux riches have always been ridiculed . Aristophanes poked gentle fun at them in The Clouds . Plato , in the next generation , thought they should never be rated as more than Bronze People , along with // porters and laborers , and should never meet the Silver People ( or warriors ) , or the Gold People ( the rulers ) . But there they are . It may take some time , but many of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Fuggers , those mediaeval " money lenders , " and somewhat less time to grant titles to the Rothschilds . There was , for example , a very successful pirate named Lascelles towards the end of the eighteenth century . He decided to " swallow the anchor , " stay ashore , and to become respectable . He succeeded in the end , for his descendent was the late Earl of Harewood , who having married Mary the Princess Royal , became son-in-law to King George V , brother-in-law to King George VI , and uncle to Queen Elizabeth II . It is an old story , and the rigidity of the estate or even royal system were never more than ideals . A Roman Jewish merchant , Pierleoni , was converted and married his daughter to King Roger of Sicily . Their descendents became ancestors to the Bourbon branch of the House of France and hence to the great King Louis XIV himself . His successor , Louis XV , married his offspring abroad and so founded the Bourbon Parma , Bourbon Sicily , Bourbon Spain , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the crowned heads and pretenders of Europe . If middle class millions and shrewd marriages are combined , a family can go far . Thus , a German banker named Ernest Cassel migrated to England and became tremendously rich . He is the direct ancestor of the present Duke of Edinburgh , who in turn is the father of Prince Charles , the heir apparent of the British throne . We have noticed that part of the process of symbiosis , as a sorter of humans into a hierarchy and as a system maintenance device , is the willingness to live together . Moving into a " good neighborhood " is therefore a favorite American technique of social climbing . This is well , for the children of the mobile upward will make friends with those of the established families , and the mother will sooner or later be invited into the house she so desires to enter . Using the children as a means of social climbing suggests that education is another American favorite . Many a poor child is being pressured into school work beyond his ability since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents . A high school scholarship award is working the same way . It is useless to say that grades and diplomas are not ladders for upward mobility . They are , and every professor can speak of the scrutiny with which corporation personnel managers examine grades . It is useless to deny that graduation from the " better " preparatory schools and the more selective universities do not give youth an advantage . One observes that in certain cities there are even socially rated public high schools , which is something new . In any event , education as a technique of social climbing is not entirely new . The mediaeval university scholar was ex officio a gentleman , could carry a sword , and challenge any nobleman to combat as a matter of right . Conversion from a church attended by the lesser members of the // social system to that preferred by the superordinate is known in America . This is noticed as between parishes in largely one church countries . Attending High Mass at the Madeleine in Paris is watching the " rightist " power structure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same service at Notre Dame de la Lorette is observing how the unfortunate resolve their sorrows . One would have to go to other churches , or none at all , if he wants to see the industrial or financial power structures . It could be that there would be less heartbreak to unsuccessful strivers if these rituals were made more official , formal , and openly ritualized . Much can be said of the British method of knighting really successful men in their old age . Granting life peerages which will not survive the recipient does install the very successful into the senate of the Lords when they would not , dream of running for office . It is said that as the years go by , the House of Peers is more and more the Encyclopaedia Britannica in session , which is not an unworthy situation . Many of the foregoing pages have indicated a great fluidity in the status hierarchies of Western nations , way over and above the requirements of an open class society based on social mobility by merit . Structures are shifting so rapidly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of class war , he can mention class vendetta . Well-established , homogenous social systems have always relied heavily on the myths of their worth . These myths are being bitterly attacked in this generation and , as Chapter 27 will show , the attack is proving to be better myth writers than the defense . Our day is a fertile one for utopian myths . Indeed , the process from homogeneity to social heterogeneity is presently so rapid that it is hard for myth making to catch up . Roger Bastide says that this lies back of the tendency of the most affected nations to abandon even the myth as a maintenance device and to rely on political messianism.2 16 Kin and Community It may be unusual to discuss the kinship and community under one heading ; for a moment one might question the reason for brigading them together . However , both types of systems are cultural constructs in a very real , human , and artificial way . Both have clear roots in primate behavior , and at this infrahuman base , these branches are so close together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of primates revealed that the mating of the higher forms is not promiscuous and that there is a strong tendency among them for a male to enter into rather permanent relationship with one female , or with just a few . It was observed in those pages that the family was not an invention of humanity and that the phenomenon can be observed in forms of lesser classification than primates . It was seen that a certain structure is observable among lions . It must be emphasized , however , that even if the family antedates the appearance of man , and human society is derived from it , marriage is a human invention . The family is a biological fact . Marriage is an institution and is just as much a cultural phenomenon as any other system in that category . There is a highly reminiscent note in wild chimpanzee life , for the poor old male in that pongid society is " henpecked " just about as often as among the tongue-lashed Eskimo or modern Western man . However , we should voice two warnings . Apes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense . Promiscuity infers deliberate , conscious action , a known violation of a cultural tabu , and only man is capable of such behavior . One has a hard time choosing the adjective appropriate to the higher primates , and one supposes that " casual " is as good a word as any . The second is that one should not take as absolute the inference that the nearer the primates approach anatomical and neurological human standards , the closer they resemble mankind 's standards of sexual organization . Shall we say that , by and large , the field evidence now in our hands indicates that this is largely true , but there are exceptions . // Previous chapters have shown that man did not evolve into his present anatomical condition of being Homo sapiens sapiens and then launch into his culture-making career . A large terrestrial monkey , with a brain small by any human standards and a not very large one by those of apes , made recognizable tools . This form was not really upright . It could run bipedally , but could not walk erect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the human just emerging from babyhood to childhood . This thing started culture on its way , and in its subsequent development , the enlarged human brain responded to cultural inherency , which made man just as surely as man made tools . On the short-time view , we repeat the statement made before that culture evolved from this kind of body . Again , on the short-time aspect , we may repeat another doctrine previously announced that human personality and social behavior flowed from this kind of body . If one has grasped the holistic theory of this volume , however , he must take a long-time view . This indicates that bodily structure and behavior can not be considered apart . Tools , anatomy , physiology , and social behavior can not be separated . All of them are mutually interacting phenomena . It is just as true that social structure produced man as he is now as that humanity created group organization . ' Curious , striving , dominance-submission obsessed , vital , blessed and cursed by a sexuality and rage which seem to increase as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else if he were to develop into a man . Certainly these last two had to be suppressed , sex by the kinship and rage by the community . At this point the natural selection of organic evolution and sociocultural selection , often called here telestic inherency , joined , and the two produced Homo sapiens sapiens . They can never be separated again . No matter whether savant or ruler likes the word , and many detest it , we must now look to sociology in the broad sense of the word for our answers . There are tremendous sociological differences between the most humanlike primates and the organization of the simplest men . It may be that human societies " developed " out of primate ones , but in this course a very sharp break with the past occurred . Kin and community do have infrahuman roots , but roots are not enough . We have already said that the human social system is both permissive and repressive of the organism , but repression was necessary before anything like human life could be permitted . The homeostasis of primates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ours is sociological . Higher primates can learn a bit and can thus produce some structure . We , by contrast , must learn much , and elaborate social structures come as something new in the world . They must fit into their environment , and if this changes , they must slowly adjust by natural selection and mutation . Man creates much of his environment , and even if he // is a tropical primate , he can by culture inhabit the earth and grope towards paths away from the planet . Primate society is largely limited by the body , and while human culture was derived from the physical weakness of man , it has created a new order which to a great degree emancipated humanity from the tyranny of its organism . The relatively stable matings of the higher primates are based on the physiology of the conditionable response , on the habit-making quality of successful coitus . The conditioning nature of successful sexual relations may help maintain a happy human family , especially in the younger years , but it did not originate in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural inventions and invariably repress human sexuality . Scholarship has accepted the fact of a human shift of sexual control from the hormones to the cortex , and this has not been a man-making experiment of nature for the benefit of any individual , nor has it entirely pleased anyone . It is useless to say that sex is a burden to humanity , and that had nature been kinder we would have reproduced by binary fission and that we should find adequate tension release in a rousing bout of setting-up exercise . Some humans do not try to reproduce at all , and others find ataraxia for tension release in physical exercise , but fortunately they do not run this world . Most of us have to live with what we have , and as humans we have clamped an unbelievably complex system of norms on sex . As men , we live by cooperation , and any continual competition for mates and food could not and did not produce human society . Wherever we look , we see that cultural inventions in whole or in part repress sexuality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food quest , the material culture of tools , clothes , and housing , the strictures of age , social position , religion or even the requirements of a good harvest season , every human sociocultural invention , including kinship , takes priority over sex , for untrammeled sexuality intruding into any of these systems or subsystems will produce turbulence , not order . There is so much work to be done in any society that sex must not interfere . The last sentence in the above paragraph maintained that all structure in all social systems , all ritualized group behavior , and certainly all institutions , including marriage , has at its core the repression of sex , either covertly , gently , and unconsciously , or overtly , harshly , and purposefully . Human society is not a development out of and expression of " instinctive " primate sexuality . The two concepts are enemies . Lest one be expelled for preaching against Diana of the Ephesians , as Paul was , or as a foe of Aphrodite of the Strangers , goddess of Corinth , one must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homeostasis of the typical personality includes adequate sexual adjustment . Many fail in this . Chapter 25 on failure and deviance will make a point that somewhere in the pattern of all deviant behavior , sexual maladjustment can he found . While the following statement has not been " proven scientifically , " and this is no credit to the present state of reKIN // search , the experience of criminal investigation departments , criminal courts , and penal authorities suggests the hypothesis that sexual maladjustment or incompetence lies at the core of every crime which involves primary transaction , and many of them which are of secondary nature . Strangely enough , this statement holds for rapists . As for real men , the French founders of criminalistics were not mad when they said , " Cherchez la femme ! " You will always find one , or an unsatisfactory substitute . This statement refers largely to the male deviant , but has anyone ever interviewed a happy , successful wife who is a victim of compulsive kleptomania ? Has any physician read the case history of an alcoholic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also reveals sexual competence ? In any event , sex and genetics are biological relationships which have to be taught to the young . Children must be taught that they are male or female , so why introduce instinct ? There is no reason to think that our remote ancestors " instinctively " knew of the relationship between sex and procreation . The aboriginal Australian Arunta had to be taught the connection by the English , and we are told that some of the Trobriand Islanders will not believe it to this day . Leave instinct out of all this . The social has wrested priority from the zoological . Sex has been repressed by the kinship , and kinship is a cultural invention of such universality that it is another man-making phenomenon . Like all other institutions , it is a function of articulate speech . No ape can say that " cross-cousins are descendents of siblings of opposite sex , " or that " the avunculate is a homeostatic system of parental-filial surrogates in matrilinear , matrilocal social systems , " and they could not care less . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the equally universal incest tabu . The nuclear family is the kind Americans practice , is the only type legal in that society . This consists of a married pair and their immediate offspring . This simple relationship of husband-wife , child-parent , brothersister is universal , and for that matter , is the one form of family shared with our primate kin . Primates do not have marriage , however , as that term must be confined to the cultural ritualization of a relationship of which sexual expression and procreation is only a part . The family is only a biological and psychological fact . Thus , a man may be a member of one nuclear marriage , but by keeping a fertile concubine , may be the head of more than one family . This is not a far-fetched statement . It was certainly a common enough situation in classical Rome , what with the predilection to domestic slavery of that culture . It is a situation far from unknown to Western Europe and modern America at the opening of this century , although an educated guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation , inheritance and other taxes , and an obsessive desire for increased economic consumption are making it virtually impossible for a man to maintain one family without a gainfully employed wife . The term nuclear family as used in these pages will assume that the union has been ritualized and conforms reasonably to the // normative pattern of its culture , wherever that may be , unless an exception is specifically mentioned . That sexual relations between parents and children , or between brother and sister , are universally forbidden and punished by sanction has long been accepted by anthropologists as a cultural universal . More than one cross-cultural investigation has been made of the published material on peoples throughout the world , and the answer has always been the same . The incest tabu is universal . Some exceptions will be mentioned in a few paragraphs , but they prove the rule rather than invalidate it . All indications are that this is man 's first sexual norm and that it is the threshold between the sexual family and the institution of marriage , which once crossed , committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently the foundation of all other types and of the social system as well . The fact of universality being well attested , the inquiring mind must seek an explanation . The theoretical and book-writing propensity of mankind has showered us with explanations , some of them fantastic indeed . In a fairly serious vein , however , one has heard both scholars and laymen announce that there is an instinctive horror of incest . Need one go into instinct in this generation ? If instinct were involved , it would be automatic . Instead , the older generation must teach the young about relative avoidance and severely rebuff advances . Instead of instinct , one has always to combat an ever present Oedipal situation . Akin to the above there is an idea that folk wisdom has a built-in knowledge of the genetic danger of inbreeding . What is one to say when there remain people , like the Arunta of Australia or the Trobriand Islanders , who still refuse to believe that the male has any part in the procreation of his son , and yet these folk enforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly exaggerated , as evidenced by some very able race horses . Inbreeding limits the genes of the offspring and tends to bring out the recessive traits , but some of these may be extremely functional . As for any built-in knowledge , unless the reader has had more than one course in genetics , just what does he know about it ? Science has changed its mind about the number of chromosomes a human has in the decade of this writing , and no one knows the number of human genes . As a matter of fact , the norms of more than one society permit the mating of persons of closer genetic relationship than some of the tabued unions . Once the incest tabu was invented , the idea may have spread that inbreeding is dysgenic , but is this not a later generalization ? 2 Science has yet to unravel all the reasons for the incest tabu , but when it does , the answer will be the result of interdisciplinary effort . The best answer we have to date lies in the realm of the social , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a useful going concern , is a work unit and // an educational device . It is , then , a social system , and the incest tabu is a system maintenance device . According to Malinowski 's principle of legitimation , every child must have an adult male protectively to stand between it and its social environment . This could hardly work if the son were also the father 's sexual rival or comate . Despite the apparent Oedipal attraction of the mother to the son , this must be repressed if either parent is to have authority over him . Enculturation and socialization are real needs if the race is to survive , and these can be accomplished only with authority . A mother 's power of discipline and teaching over a daughter can not be undermined by the daughter 's excessively intimate attachment with the father . A parent can not be an authority figure at one moment and a lover at the next . Siblings are , of course , offspring of the same parent , and sibling rivalry is problem enough among all peoples . Brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be riven by sexual jealousy . There is a tendency for age groups to unite against the elders at best , and wherever either legal or clandestine brother-sister sexuality exists , the father-mother superordination is threatened . Actually , there are certain dysfunctions in the incest tabu . Brothers and sisters have already formed patterns of origination and response . These have to be established anew with marriage to a stranger . There are several societies which bring a very young bride early into the patrilocal family so that she may grow up with her future husband in an effort to solve just this problem . The nuclear family is weak and short-lived at best . Its life is limited to that of the parental generation , and each one must be formed from the beginning . The loss of a daughter able with the hoe through marriage breaks the economic stability of the nuclear family . There is the redistribution of land and herds , all of which would be solved by consistent brothersister marriages . These dysfunctions , however , are never thought to equal the functions of marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful in hunting and war , and no one but the most uprooted , acculturized populations fails to recognize the value of the extended family . Indeed , the incest tabu was more valuable to the less secure nonliterate peoples than it is to modern urban folk . So many other institutions are protecting these people , after a fashion , that they do not need the extended family . We do not know what the situation once was , nor really what it is today , for normative pressures from both inside the family and the community make incest as clandestine an offense as can be . Yet every medical or criminological sample we have made in recent years shows that incest is neither uncommon , nor confined to the lowest and most " depraved " segments of modern society . There are a very few social systems that have permitted and even ritualized it under extremely limited circumstances . An excessive polygyny , coupled with an idea of the sacred character of a royalty or nobility , seems to suggest brother-sister relations and even marriage . The former weakens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , royalty // tends to produce children who are likely to make up their own rules . Such divine families are furthermore jealous of sharing the power with outsiders . Thus , the Pharaohs of Egypt favored sister marriages , as did the highly tabued nobles of old Hawaii and the sun-descended monarchs of Incan Peru . The divine priest-kingships of Middle America knew the system . The very great nobles among the African Azande could marry a daughter , and the Pahlevi Texts showed that the magi , or priestly caste of old Persia , considered a man blessed if he had a son in his old age and that son were also his grandson . A very great hunter among the South African BaThonga can cohabit with his daughter before an important hunt , but would suffer sanctions should he so behave at other times . Such exceptions do indeed prove rather than invalidate the rule . The principle still holds for the bulk of the subject population . Legal and ritualized incest among the very few mentioned above is an extremely high status symbol just because it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The literature does not reveal a people which does not extend the tabu beyond the nuclear family . Let us pause for a moment , however , to distinguish between a consanguineal relationship and an affinal one . Persons recognized as being genetically related , or " blood kin , " as the popular saying goes , are consanguineal relatives . Thus , one 's father 's brother is a consanguineal relative , but his wife is an affinal one , not an aunt by " blood " but one by ritual . Among ourselves , all consanguineal relatives of one 's spouse are affinal ones , usually called " in-laws " in our language . A man 's wife 's sister is a sister-in-law , and her children are called nieces and nephews . It is therefore very useful to other than highly urban populations to have as many affinal relatives as possible to bolster the consanguineal ones in economic pursuits and protection . This homeostatic system of real or honorary relatives represented security and success to most people , a hard thing for us who consider even the consanguineal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prosperous . Studies have shown that every degree of consanguineal and affinal kin fall under the incest tabu among some people.3 Others permit marriage or cohabitation with just those who are tabued in other societies . ' Thus , a sweet and accommodating little sister-in-law is the subject of many a love song among some non-Slavic tribes in Russia . The avunculate , or dominance of the uncle , lays so heavily on the young men of the northern Wisconsin tribes that access to the affinal aunt was considered compensation for the harshness . We need not examine the record of little known tribes . Among ourselves , the second wife of one 's father is no genetic relative , but she falls under the incest tabu both by custom and church law . Marriage to her , in whatever states permit it , is immoral in any conservative American commu- // nity and will reduce the interactional pattern of both parties . An adopted child is surely affinal , but relations with her are incestuous . Marriage with her after the death of the wife is incestuous by custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community and the object of humor in the liberal ones . Sister-in-law and brother-in-law are affinal kin . Extramarital relations with them are permitted in some cultures , condemned in others , and marriage with either requires a dispensation in the conservative churches . This tabu is dysfunctional , as transactional rates have already been established between the two prospective spouses and their children . There were some remarkable scandals in Victorian England caused by marriages between such persons during widowhood . One thinks , however , that even the moral stricture no longer applies in the United States and Great Britain . The incest tabu suggests two matrimonial norms called exogamy or recommended or compulsory marriages outside a certain kin group , and endogamy , or mating within a similar system . Exogamy is a clear-cut moral and often legal norm and one of great formality . While it very probably is an extension of the incest tabu , just where the one leaves off and the other begins has been a subject of some debate and not one which can be settled here . Exogamy usually follows the lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbidden to marry any woman who is ritually called " sister , " and these may include the majority of a kinship system . By contrast , if his cousins on one side of his kinship , the maternal one , are addressed by sisterly terms and the other side is not , his marriage must be exogamous only with reference to those of sororal address . Cross-cousin marriages , then , are often permitted and sometimes required , while parallel ones are forbidden . For some reason , the terms cross- and parallel-cousin seem to confuse the beginning student , who may be well supplied with both kinds . Persons who are descendents of siblings of the same sex are parallel cousins . Decendents of siblings of opposite sex are cross-cousins . Thus , regarding the speaker 's cross-cousins , they are the offspring of his father 's sister , or aunt on his father 's side . They are likewise the offspring of his mother 's brother , or his maternal uncle . Although the relationship is usually known to exist , a cross-cousin is ritually not a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kin designation , while a parallel cousin is styled by the same sib name as the speaker and stands in fraternal-sororal relationship . Sib exogamy usually , then , forbids the marriage of parallel cousins but not of cross-cousins . Local as well as kin exogamy is sometimes required . Thus , in many parts of the South Pacific , a man may not have dalliance or marriage with a young woman of his own village , but may have complete liberty with all others in the society . Actually , the chances are that his fellow citizens in the village arc also his genetic relatives , so the distinction is not very great . This discussion suggests to the beginner that there are many ways of counting kin , and so there are . Any writer would wish that his beginning students could he presented with the system devised by George Peter Mur328 SOCIAL SYSTEMS dock , but this seems unwise at this stage of education . Indeed , some startling ways in which kinship can be counted and the forms which marriage can take as outlined by Professor Murdock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this complexity , how institution building can take priority over the organism , but also substantiate the present reintroduction of the principle of diminishing returns.5 This also casts a gleam of amusement on the misuse of the word primitive by anthropologists of the past . If this word means simplicity , our matrimonial system is primitive . An anthropologist would rather teach his beginning students how to play an acceptable game of chess than introduce him to the marriage systems of the Australian aborigine , who could not count to one hundred if his life depended on it . Kin may be reckoned first as either bilateral or unilinear . A bilateral kinship is the one we practice , in a rather weak way . This means that we count kin on both sides of one 's descent . One 's relatives on his mother 's side are just as much his kin as those on his father 's . The offspring of both his mother 's and his father 's siblings are his first cousins , and their parents are equally uncles and aunts . A unilinear kinship , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may be along either the maternal or paternal line . This expression is usually called a sib , or a clan . Such unilinear kinships are usually symbolized by a name which , as one can readily see , gives anyone a far wider kinship for his support and protection than an indeterminate number of bilateral relatives who are not characterized by a name . Name taking may , of course , be either on the mother line , and hence metronymic , or on the father line , and hence patronymic . We , for example , are both bilateral and patronymic . Exogamy is easier to conceptualize and to enforce in a unilinear than a bilateral kinship system . The types of the marriage relation are themselves manifold . The large picture is painted by the classical terms of pair marriage ( a term preferred to monogamy ) and polygamy . Analysis of the Greek polygamy ( polys , much and gamein , to marry ) indicates multiple legal marriages . Polygamy is divided into polygyny and polyandry . If a woman has more than one accepted husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and androi , men ) . Likewise , if a man has more than one socially accepted wife at a time , this is polygyny ( gyne , woman ) . Pair marriage represents the real , nuclear family , which probably is close to the original human situation . It is forbidden by no society and is the standard for all humanity , no matter which is the preferred type . It is here that children are the more easily taught their culture and society . It is the ideal primary group , and we have seen the paramount nature of that microsystem . The nuclear family , as we have said , is universal and is its most // important form , some very distinguished authority to the contrary . Murdock has written , Whatever larger familiar forms may exist and to whatever extent the greater unit may assume some of the burdens of the lesser , the nuclear family is always recognizable and always has its distinctive and vital functions  --  sexual , economic , reproductive , and educational . It is usually spatially as well as socially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing , but for the moment let us assume that we are examining a social system where they are . If this is also matrilinear and matrilocal , the young couple living permanently with her extended family , and if she or her kin own the farm land and the family dwelling , the husband 's lot is something less than happy from a modern American viewpoint . She and hers will be very important people in the husband 's world . This does not mean that the men need be weaklings . The extremely warlike Iroquois were in this situation , and maybe they had something to fight about . Polygyny is undoubtedly the world 's preferred system , as shown by more than one survey . Actually , the bulk of any population can only afford pair marriage , but if the social system permits polygyny , and it is reported that this is the preferred type , it must be labelled as polygynous . The very idea is repulsive to American wives , but they are thinking of status and a fracture of the suburban transactional pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the principal resistance to " modernization " of these " undeveloped " nations is presently coming from them . In Dahomey , for example , each wife has her own house in the husband 's compound , which he visits with scrupulous impartiality . Multiple marriages on his part means less work for any one wife and an increase of agricultural production . This type of polygyny is really an assemblage of nuclear families with a common head . There is no " baby sitting " problem here , and this is a real one if the women are working in the fields or going to market . It therefore has certain advantages in the education of children . If , as it is written in the Koran , " Four wives thou mayest have and no more , but as many concubines as it pleases God to put in your hands , " a perpetual bridge game could go on without leaving the home . Polygyny also extends the family to a larger number of armed affinals who may come in handy in a dispute . One can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Different sociocultural systems have different needs . It is certain , however , that males have a higher mortality rate than females . As they do the dangerous work of fighting and hunting , more than one system has too few men to go around . Mohammed said that it is more charitable for wealthy men to marry orphan girls than to permit them to suffer without the necessities of life . One may also cast some doubt on the statistical cliche that as the birth rates for male and female are about equal , pair marriage is the only practical type // of mating . The writing of Herskovits has surely shown that there is an excessive female birth rate in Dahomey , and one may suspect that this is true elsewhere . Several American states have a high feminine sex ratio because of migration . The population of South Carolina , for example , is heavily feminine , while that of Nevada is masculine . Were these affairs worked out rationally , polygyny would be legalized in South Carolina and polyandry in Nevada , but this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were better for the body politic that a certain number of otherwise worthy persons be denied the reinforcement and ' prop of some kind of a family , especially in the later years when one needs a home the most . It is generally said that the rich men are the only ones who can afford polygyny . This , perhaps , is true at face value , but it may be the able men rather than the rich ones who can attract plural wives . A Plains Indian was rich because he had strong " medicine " or occult powers and was successful in war . If he were successful in war , he captured many horses . A man rich in horses got many bison hides and much meat . Such a man could have many wives who could prepare this animal produce and thus amass a surplus . With this , he could barter for anything , especially trade goods at the Hudson 's Bay , Astor , or Choteau store . However it all may be , the excessive polygyny of some Oriental potentates in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rohrschach report on King Solomon . Many of these wives were status symbols and means of binding alliances , but anyone who approves of them understands but little of the needs of women . Polyandry is an extremely rare but competently reported phenomenon . This does not mean that we understand all the reasons for it , but professional field work is in progress on the subject . The Tibetan , or fraternal type , is the best known , and a half-century ago it was said that the land in Tibet is so poor that it takes more than one husband to provide for a family . However this may have been once , it is sure that it is the well-to-do Tibetans who are polyandrous now , the bulk of the population being given to pair marriage . Poverty may be the explanation in some cases . It was reported that in the depths of the great depression the farmers in a certain far western state could not get in a crop with their own hands , and having no money with which to pay hired hands , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people practice female infanticide , and the more vigorous their protests to ethnographers , the more they are suspect . Poverty is not all . There is a type of polyandry known in Polynesia , where the young girls cohabit widely with any and all youths who do not fall under incest tabu . These girls usually marry an older and more prosperous man . As a kindness , this elder may permit the bride to bring her favorite lover into the family as cohusband . Now , with this extra laborer , the man may become rich indeed and marry more wives . If his magnanimity permits them to bring their lovers into the group , he has quite a sizable , unpaid labor force at his command . // This sounds something like group marriage , does it not ? This term , however , is now confined to the earlier literature . Two very small and obscure societies may actually practice the marriage of a group of women to a group of men , but their population is so small that they should not be permitted to affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would seem that a social system practicing polygyny would abhor polyandry , but is this necessarily so ? If the rich , or the able men take most of the women , perhaps polyandry is all that is left for the others . Actually , the two systems have been reported as existing side by side in Eskimo villages . Polyandry may well represent an ancient recognition of population pressure . The child bearer , not the begetter , limits the population . Once such norms are internalized , however , they may eventually become dysfunctional . The Toda are a hill tribe of north India , and their polyandrous institution served them very well at one time . The present modernization of India , however , has resulted in their being subjected to many unbearable pressures . They will disappear within a few generations if they do not abandon polyandry . Permitted or obligatory affinal marriages are far from uncommon throughout the world and were almost typical of North American Indians . The sororate refers to the permission or obligation of a man to marry his wife 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only does this strengthen the ties between two families but , in a way , is the most convenient type of polygyny . The sisters have already established their transactional rates , the younger being accustomed to terminating to the elder . It is the only polygyny permitted on the Great Plains unless one cares to include the occasional cohabitation with a captive enemy woman as polygynous . If the sororate was not obligatory , a young woman 's sister 's husband 's permission often had to be obtained for her to marry another man . The levirate is the above system in reverse . An older brother often had the obligation to provide the younger brother with a wife . Indeed , the obligation to marry the older brother 's widow is noted in many places . This was all very good if the widow were attractive and a productive worker , but if she were not , it had to be looked upon as a type of mother 's pension . Charity is all very well , but it could be as cold among the Great Plains Indian as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and her children , and her brother-in-law was a logical choice . The levirate prevented the disruption of transactional rates between two families , and the return of bride prices and doweries is inconvenient . The curse against Onan in the thirty-eighth- chapter of Genesis was not because he spilled his seed upon the ground , but because he would not beget a child upon his sister-in-law Tamar so that his dead brother 's name would not vanish from Israel . The present American majority practice of permitting the young peo plc to make their own choices is aberrant in the world and symbolizes the // decline of the family 's importance . Marriage in simpler cultures is far too serious economically and transactionally to trust to something as unstable as " love " between two irresponsible young people . By contrast , premarital sex expression is more commonly tolerated among such people than it is among those on whom the transactional burdens of civilization rest . Premarital relations among the Indians of the Southeast United States , for example , was as open and common as " dating " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who violated the exclusiveness of pair marriage , however , was often divorced and forced to become a permanent prostitute . Anthropologists are often asked about premarital pregnancies in such situations as the above , and for years not even biologists would believe the report of their extreme rarity . A child born out of wedlock on some Melanesian islands is considered the result of witchcraft , and both child and mother are ostracized . How else could men who refuse to accept their role in procreation think ? Biologists in this day , however , have established statistically a postpubertal period of relative sterility in most girls ' lives . Marriage is more important than dalliance and individual pleasure . More than one social system betroths their young as children , infant girls especially . At first glance one would think that such a practice would be confined to stable systems wherein economic or political considerations are paramount . Child marriages were common among the royal and most noble houses of old Europe . By contrast , some of the humblest and poorest American Indians practiced infant betrothal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , very rare . Much has been made of bride purchase , some of which is partly true . This is rarely a real chattel sale , as the husband can not resell his wife . Most African women look upon their bride price as a status symbol , and more than one anthropologist has heard them make remarks about American and European women who can be obtained for free . A true bride price is looked upon as compensation for a family 's loss of a valuable worker , but much discussion of the sale of marriageable daughters is nothing of the kind . The woman 's family more often than not makes presents of equal value to the man 's , which is actually gift exchange to fortify the new transactional pattern between the two kinships . The frankly monetary aspects of such weddings can and often are solved by daughter exchange . Bride service , wherein the young men must work for his betrothed 's family system for years , as reported in the Old Testament , is a sensible method of compensating his wife 's kin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishing a transactional pattern between the young people before they go off on their own . An adequate description of marriage norms would reinforce what has already been said , that instinct could play but little role in all this and that sex must he and is subordinated to almost every other requirement of society . This is why the open ritualization of the biological fact is so important . It represents an agreement between two systems wherein the economic , popuKIN // lation , and protective norms are more important than the introduction to cohabitation . The lack of the open public aspect of the somewhat common secret marriage of many urban young couples would make many a sociocultural system brand them as immoral , as being more of a deference to the bride 's surviving puritan moral norms than the formation of any marriage at all . As a general principle to which many exceptions can be made , one could say that the more voice the young couple have in their mating , the less economically successful the culture they practice , the less complicated their social system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsystems to which they belong . American practices mark the greatest of all exceptions to this rule , which may be one of the more important diagnostic signs of this culture 's condition . If the kinship is virtually disappearing and if the community is declining , as the next few pages will indicate , some other institution must pick up their former functions , or the pieces , and a later chapter will show which one this is . The declining role of the kinship is easily attested by the unfamiliarity to American thinking and practice of almost all of the following terms . Beginning with the easiest , the extended family is not foreign to our emotions and social control . Although it is declining , most Americans have known the nuclear family to be extended to include the grandparental generation , the consanguineal and affinal uncles and aunts , together with their offspring , who are cousins . The great lateral mobility of the day makes a curio of the three generation family as an economic and control group , although the grandparental generation is an economic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their independence . Retirement and nursing homes are far from satisfactory replacements for the kinship . We still remember the family extended according to locality . According to where the newly married make their home , either by normative requirement or preference , it can be patrilocal , matrilocal , bilocal , avunculocal , or neolocal . If the new couple resides with the man 's kin , it is patrilocal , a practice well within our memory , and in a way , still enforced by law . This was the custom of the larger southern plantations as economically important production units and helps account for the size of the residences where the land was the richest . The sons were supposed to bring their wives to live at the paternal home , the young men heading departments in the farm operation , one the head of sugar , another responsible for rice , another supervising the marketing , and so on . If this continued into the next filial generation , the kinship , together with its slaves , freedmen , and hangers-on , formed a closely knit economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the new couple resides with the bride 's kin , is foreign to our tradition , hut its strength was similar to that of the patrilocal , patronymic system we remember . If this system is coupled with the avunculate , wherein the mother 's eldest surviving brother is the authority figure and // is the parental surrogate who actually rules the children , the young couple may be forced to live with him , and the system can be called avunculocal . The avunculate need not , of course , be matrilinear , but it is more reasonable that way . The practice may seem odd to us , but in systems which permit easy divorce , mother 's husband may be a somewhat unstable role . Her brother , however , is a permanent functionary , who may be replaced by the next eldest maternal sibling should the senior meet with premature death . While he had serious obligations wherever the avunculate existed , the chances are that the man would have more nieces than daughters . Thus , his affinal nephews and their offspring formed a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American North Pacific Coast . Bilocality , where the young couple might rotate residence between the bride 's kin and the husband 's , is not a common practice . It seems to be a tension release device in some parts of Melanesia , such as in Dobu , where the attitudes and practice towards the affinals is very harsh . No matter how much a man is exploited and abused by his wife 's relatives , including his own children , he could look forward to the day when he would be living with his own kin . There he would be loved by his sisters and their children , and there he could exploit and beat his brothers-in-law . Bilocality has caused considerable confusion in the allotment of government benefits according to " band " and village residence among some American Indians . If a man had been registered as resident in his wife 's village , but has for years lived in his patrilocal community , he might end up with no government support at all . Neolocality , which is presently popular with Americans , a system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residence , is the weakest of all , as many statistics on divorce , public relief , and juvenile delinquency clearly reveal . But let us return to the consanguineal method of extending the nuclear family . The lineage is far from American practice . It is an entirely consanguineal system and only rarely has residential import . The lineage includes no affinals and is strictly unilinear . Wives do not drop their kin designation or name and do not enter the lineage of their husbands . If the lineage is patrilinear and patronymic , all children belong to the paternal lineage , the daughters as well as the sons . If it is matrilinear and metronymic , all descendents remain in their mother 's lineage . A lineage is ordinarily unilinear and exogamous and includes only those who actually know of their genetic relationship . Americans are patronymic but bilateral in kin count , and they by no means think that all persons with craft names are descended from one smith , carpenter , cook , fletcher ( arrow-maker ) , or baker , and certainly no one thinks that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor all the Dicksons and Jacksons are from one Richard or Jack . A sib is a strictly unilinear kin grouping , either on the father or mother line and is exoganonis and consanguincal . All sib members claim to be descended from a common patriarch , but unlike lineage members , can not // prove this . There is usually a folklore about the deeds of the eponymous ( name-giving ) hero , whether he be a totemic human or an animal-like progenitor . For example , even a cynical realist like Caius ( a " given " name ) Julius ( sib designation ) Caesar ( style of the sub-sib ) must have been proud of the Julii . His imperial relatives were . The Pontii seem to have been a folk decent enough to keep out of history with the exception of a member of the Pilatus sub-sib . The probabilities are that the majority of social systems are or were sib organized . Sibs usually include several lineages , and the latter may have been the origin of the former . A lineage could have divided and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have forgotten their common origin . It is obvious that on several continents the sibs themselves could have become unwieldy through population growth . This may have produced the phenomenon known in the literature as the phratry , which is a loose brotherhood of sibs . Phratries are not very well understood kinship organizations , and it seems that nowhere do they have very important functions to perform . They seem to have buried each other 's dead in Athens , and they were football leagues among the Southeastern Indians . Many societies are dichotomized into moieties of several sibs each . Moieties are often named according to contrasting concepts . Among many American Indians , the dichotomy is into Above People and Below People . Thus , among the Winnebago of Wisconsin , if one is a member of the Turtle sib , he could not marry a Beaver wife , for the rules of exogamy included both the sib and the Below Folk . A Southeastern system was to dichotomize the society into Peace People and War People . A town with predominantly Peace residents therein was painted white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red . The chiefs of the Peace sibs supervised the economic activities and the internal relations of the society , while the War moiety had charge of the external relations , including military activity . It was therefore fortunate that General Oglethorpe founded Savannah in the jurisdiction of a Peace town , whose chiefs forbade the War moiety from wiping out the little Georgia colony while it remained weak . On the less serious side , these two moieties formed the " national leagues " for playing off the championship in chunkee , a form of lacrosse . We must now return to the concept of space , which is often combined with the kinship aspect . Thus , if members of the same kin lived in the same part of a town , that area and relationship may be referred to as a barrio . Recent anthropological literature also recognizes the deme , not very fortunate as the word has been used in another significance . A deme is a combination Of descent and residence and is in effect a type of community . Denies usually have a preference towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict about its enforcement . It may be that a deme is actually bilateral with only a unilinear preference . A more important kin plus residence phenomenon is seen in the clan . // This term has long been used in anthropology , being usually synonymous with the sib , and in America in the past , a matrilinear one . Murdock in his now classic Social Structure gave a new meaning to the term , identifying it with a phenomenon often observed but not hitherto named . The clan in Murdock 's sense combines both the residential and the genetic concepts . Thus , if one is observing a patrician , he sees first that it includes all the males . These men all belong to the same sib , but the grouping also contains their wives , who belong to other sibs . It includes all the male offspring of this grouping who will belong permanently to the patriclan . The unmarried female offspring are also members , but while they will remain members of the sibs into which they were born , they will through exogamous marriage become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarly , contains all the women of the same sib . Being matrilinear and matrilocal , it contains their husbands , who still remain members of their sibs but who have joined their wives ' matriclans . The daughters of such unions remain members of their born matriclans , but the sons will marry into other ones , even if retaining their natal sib membership . Clans often are segregated from the rest of society by spatial considerations . Thus , if only one clan inhabits a village , the phenomenon is called a clan community . If the village or town contains more than one such organization , they may be called clan barrios . This terminology can be confusing when first encountered . The following chart , diagramming an actual society which existed in the recent past , is clarification . The foregoing , as said before , represents only an outline of the reported forms of kin organization . Even this forces upon us the consideration of how such diversity ever occurred in such a simple affair as mating , procreation , and training children . Certainly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is not even a primary consideration . Seeing that it took so long to invent writing , and it requires so much time for that trait to diffuse all over the world , we can only surmise how it all came about , although some guesses may be more educated than others . It would seem that , given the mating propensities of the higher primates , stable sex relations with their resultant offspring are particularly susceptible to pressure from all the socioeconomic organizations tangent to the simple nuclear family . While one would think that mating , procreation , familial division of labor , protection of the weak and the young , and all the other functions of marriage would be deeply rooted in the emotions and therefore highly resistant to change , this simply does not seem to be true . Marriage and the family have changed rapidly for most people in the Western world in this very century , are still changing to a degree that no one can really tell what the new homeostasis will eventually be . Granted other strong institutions which do and must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humanity to mate and breed can be trusted to find an internal homeostasis which will fit the rest of the social system . One would think that tins emotional fortress of the kin would form // the most impermeable system imaginable . The reverse seems to be true . The family and the kin proves to be the most permeable of all social systems . Everything else seems to be able to invade it and alter it . This may be thin comfort indeed for the present confusion , but marriage and the family have " gone to the dogs " before and have made new and satisfactory adjustments . Once new equilibria are formed , it is to be expected that they will be disrupted again and again with every major shift in the rest of the culture . While having neither the presumption to speak the first or final word , this volume has followed Carpenter in rejecting " dichotomous oversimplified concepts such as heredity-environment , physical-mental , individual-social and animal-human " as not being very productive in solving the problems confronting the culture-bearing human . Marriage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . It is by no means sure that a new " kind " of thing appeared when man undertook the requirements of marriage . It does suggest that the doctrine of thresholds probably gives us a better explanation than one which maintains that some significant qualitative difference took place in the evolution of this or any other social institution . This threshold once passed , however , man turned a corner which could not be reversed without extermination of anything we could call human . This threshold was the universal adoption of the incest tabu , and just how that happened is far from clear . It happened , though , and brought with it the possibilities , perhaps the inherencies of the highly complex kinship systems at which former pages have hinted . The kinship 's twin universal , the community , is fraught with about as many practical and theoretical problems as the above . Here , again , we are confronted with another man-making phenomenon . Carpenter says that the primates he has observed have no communities , but have they ? This fact hinges on definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of institutions , he will have to agree with this statement . If , by contrast , he is drawn to the Parsonian idea of institution as a complex of deeply internalized and widely accepted norms , he had better take another long look at the admittedly incomplete field evidence before he says the higher primates have no communities . The problem of definition in the behavioral sciences has been encountered more than once in this volume , which indicates not so much the difficulties of defining anything involving the scatter-brain primate we call man as the lack of deep theoretical attention devoted to the total human . Perfection is not claimed for the following definition , which is not entirely original , but it is one which the writer has found satisfactory in the research field . A community is a homeostatic pattern of institutions considered in space and time . The question is now posed , Do primates enjoy such phenomena ? Let us not consider the tree-living lower primates , or even the brachiating gibbons . Let them rule among the leaves and defend the upper branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and community . It must // be clear by now that the large terrestrial monkeys and many apes live in homeostatic , sex-based collectives which can be called families . The question of prime theoretical importance lies in whether or not we can call these sexual , procreational , educational , and affectional equilibria institutions . If an institution is only a pattern of internalized and widely accepted norms , meaning in this case de facto rights and obligations and stratified social positions , as some sociologists seem to imply , it is going to be difficult to say that these animals do not have institutions . As these families are obviously grouped into homeostatic systems , one will have to say that they also have communities if he accepts the foregoing doctrine about institutions . This is untenable if one accepts the theoretical position of this work . An institution is a cultural invention far beyond the protocultural glimmer of these sublinguistic primates . The threshold of the human from subhuman is the discovery of ritual , that man-making fact which is the very core of institutionalism . True ritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structuring of relationships into a pattern of " sets , " which seems to be the crux of Chapple and Coon 's definition of institutions , leaves the terrestrial primates in possession thereof , which is surely not the opinion of these two authors . It is an established fact that the large terrestrial primate families are grouped into offensive-defensive equilibria called " bands " in the literature . Any individual not a member of such a social system is a dead one , for life even when lived in primate in-group structure is precarious at best . This was still true of the antipodal Australians and Eskimo at the opening of this century . Is this primate band , an obvious space-oriented homeostasis , a community ? If their families are institutions , it is , and we should abandon the threshold of the kinship and the incest tabu and that we dare not do . This work agrees that the roots of matrimonial institutions and community are in primate group life , but the human florescence had to have more than this infrahuman stock . We are therefore agreeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have communities . We will go a step farther in saying that anthropologists in the past erred in calling the simple space-based equilibria of flintflaking hunters " bands . " One may say that both the primate band and the simplest local groupings of human kinships are equilibria , but those of men have added several features made possible by articulate speech . They are always more than affectional and food-quest equilibria . There is always a recreational and sociable aspect to the human community , including not only hospitality and visiting within the in-group , but methods of receiving guests from without . Only those in the most extreme isolation , and these are atypical , fail to have an idea of a society beyond the community limits . A common culture , a common language , and some kind of strong or vague idea of mutual aid and assistance ties such communities together . It is true that even the upper primates have some idea of hte external and interal relations aspects of trans- // action , but even the simplest human communities have clearly or vaguely ritualized them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system with little permeability . Human communities often have similar ideas , and one has only to view the masonry skin of the mediaeval town or village fortification , or the plans of an Iroquois palisaded town to see how they felt about permeability . A feeling , weak or strong , of in-group pride and out-group hostility is the mark of a human community . Even a so-called urban slum must have this if it is inhabited by anything like men instead of clothed human organisms . The above implies the existence of a subculture for each community which is also part of an overall society . This is not too hard to understand , for a person familiar with a modern American city can tell what part of town he is in , and the sensitive ear can pick up differences in dialect . This , as mentioned before , can be a technique of social distance marking off the stranger as an out-group member . Communities with some age usually have a tradition , a folklore , which might or might not be acceptable to the overall society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities with a criminal ethos , but even the most obdurate and dissident have a pride which holds them together . Ethnocentrism is functional as well as dysfunctional , which is not always apparent in the reform-oriented social philosophy of the past . A human community is primarily a cooperative unit . Either overtly among the very poor or covertly among the prosperous , the community is an economic system for production , distribution , and consumption . This is not so clear among the higher primates wherein selfishness is the general rule . It is true that the powerful will satisfy themselves first , but they can and do cooperate from time to time . An upper primate band is very much a fighting offensive and defensive unit , but it is difficult to teach these animals what we call economic " teamwork . " One reason for this is that food sharing is characteristic of large carnivores , of which among the higher primates man is the only survivor ; so modern herbivorous apes and monkeys have little to teach us . At one end of the scale even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services , some of which may be very subtle . At the other end , a community close to starvation is characterized by food sharing . The scarcer food is , the greater the proportion the hunter must give away , for not everyone can be lucky every day , and all must eat . Communities as social systems are always characterized by structure of roles and statuses . The simplest may conduct its internal and external relations through the debates of a consensus council , but there is always a structured leadership of some kind in even the most primitive human community . This may rest in the gerontarchs , the council of the old and therefore wise and well versed in ritual . There is a human threshold to be observed here , for leadership among the herbivorous apes and monkeys goes to the strong . those who are able to appropriate to themselves as much food and // sex as they are capable of consuming , leaving the remainder to the led . Given the kinship and the incest tabu , it is incumbent on the leaders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is the man who sacrifices most who leads . That communities exist in space and time must at least be explained in outline . This need not be extensive for space , for anyone riding in a conveyance through a modern city should be able to count the communities he passes through even though his skills are not yet up to defining their borders . These boundaries change in time , and so does the culture practiced within them . Nonliterate communities , as well as modern rural and urban ones , can completely disappear , the study of which is one of the main efforts of archaeology . Thus in a certain area of a large city , one may read with difficulty the word Apotheke , or Pharmacy over a door . The community had once been inhabited by German immigrants . Emblematic of how the Germans had been displaced by the Swedes is a former church , later automobile shop , which had Saint Ansgarius carved above the door . The spirit of the holy King Ansgar had long departed with his Swedish Lutherans , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one dedicated to Our Lady Queen of Angels . The two competing ones today are Baptist and Black Muslim , and the groceries sell side meat , backbone , and chitterlings . One minority culture after another has occupied the same buildings as slum conditions deepened . Indeed , time and culture had so altered the area that it is impossible to say that it remains the same community . If anyone thinks that this is confined to the United States , he should see more of London and Paris than tourists do . Social ecologists call this processes of invasion and succession . It has just been said that communities possess subcultures strong or weak . A community as a going concern attracts persons of similar culture and personality make-up on the **33;225;TOOLONG principle often called that of aggregation and segregation . This is , of course , a drive towards order and flight from the uncertainty of turbulence . There are those Americans on one end of the continuum who , upon becoming opulent , seek the new suburbs , and on the other , there are the disorganized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the slums . There is a remarkable social similarity between the communities of all stone-flaking hunters on all continents and in all climates , so much so that there is a reasonable inference that we are looking at something very like the organization of our Paleolithic ancestors . This simple unity was lost long ago for the rest of us . First , man learned to set a seed in the ground and later to change from stone implements to metal ones . From those days forward each community had had its own ethos , a fishing community on the Isle of Arran , a steel community in Pennsylvania , a wheat community in Alberta , and each has enjoyed favorably comparing itself with the one just over the horizon . In the recently defunct popular theater , the vaudeville and burlesque , the surest way a // comedian could draw a laugh was to make a snide remark about a neighboring community . One may well say that there is but one culture area in western Europe . He may also say that this is of long standing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not differ much from either the Italic ones on the south or the Teutonic one of Hallstatt on the north and east . Nevertheless , there is a strong difference between the community feeling of the Mediterranean basin and the Teutonic north , with the Gallo-Roman forming some kind of a margin between . Mediterranean culture is the more keenly community conscious . The farmers do not like to live on their owned or rented acres . They prefer to live in a town or village and walk to the fields each day . Each is a mildly endogamous series of families , fiercely jealous of its own subculture , including cuisine and vintage , and contemptuous of the other hill village just out of sight . Each one had its own little god and now has its own patron saint , who may or may not be recognized in Rome , and the most important rite of intensification of such communities is the annual festival of that holy one . It is inaccurate to call this a mediaeval or manorial survival , for the archaeology of Remedello in North Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same tendencies . This statement is true from modern Greece to modern Spain , which is often overlooked by politicians and reformers of this day . This lack of insight interfered with the effectiveness of American military government in World War II , but at present it seems that if the Communist Party is able to put a cell in such communities , it wisely converts it into a local club for the local folk , for the time being . Strangely enough , this north-south tendency was reversed in eastern United States . The typical rural community in New England was the closed , compact township . The southern version tended towards the Gallo-Roman villa organization , with the noblesse de l'epee , or rural gentry , living on their own patriarchal manors , and the royal intendant and the noblesse de la robe , or upper officialdom , living at the seat of government . This made the county the real community , not the township . For whatever good or ill one wishes to mention , the Negroes lived in strong communities on the plantation or large farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and mutual aid . There was the official European religion , the official leadership of the overseer , and the refuge of the sick bay . There was the African religion , too , with the drums in the swamp by night . The vodun leader might or might not be the unofficial leader of the other slaves , but there was always a slave leader . The planter and his manager thought twice before interfering with this structure . Emancipation permitted everyone to leave the street , and in Teutonic fashion , to seek a separate tenant farm . Here there was no mutual personality reinforcement , no leadership , and intense denominationalism vitiated what direction the church could provide . The commissary and later the wretched little country store provided the only community center available . The distinction between the neighborhood and // the community ought to be mentioned at this point . A neighborhood is ordinarily a weak thing and provides hardly more than shelter for its inhabitants . It does , like a community , draw into its specific space persons of similar culture and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the services most essential for survival . This does not indicate that lack of community and reliance on neighborhood is confined to the underprivileged . Many suburban " bedroom towns " surrounding an American commercial city are only neighborhoods , although they usually develop some community structure in time . The outstanding difference between a community and a neighborhood is that the former contains a nucleus , which is the patterning of its constituent nonfamily institutions . As it is characteristic of institutions to own property , this nucleus becomes apparent to the eye in what is called a community center , a tightly knit pattern of stores , churches , schools , and later , moving picture theaters and a branch bank or two . It is typical of rapidly growing American , or for that matter , British cities , for families to flee from the population density of the old community and to form a neighborhood of persons of similar income . Some such areas never become communities and remain neighborhoods , parasitically relying on others to serve them , having no strong institutions of their own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of problem people , of whatever income classification . In closing , we must return to our original consideration . Why has the community been functional to social organization and personality expression ? This is because it is in such structures , especially those built on primary transaction , that manners and morals are taught and enforced . It is in them that the personality is reinforced by men with similar culture , prejudices , and definitions of the situation . The community insists that it must survive even if some individual is hurt . There is , for example , little need of the daily application of the law and police pressure , for deeply held moral norms , consensus , and public opinion provide sanction enough in a rural community . These institutions are " primary " because almost everybody knows everyone else , for better or for worse . It is true that gossip and sometimes slander keeps people " in line , " but the neighbors flock in with food and mutual aid with every emergency . This is the sacred , somewhat isolated structure sometimes called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinforcing families , its clearly understood structure of roles and statuses , and its little need for social climbing , status seeking , and competition for status symbols . The primary community was the governing body of the great majority of the earth 's population at the opening of this century are the only true communities , but secondary transaction also builds communities . These are accessible , with many highways , and yet not as well integrated as the primary type . They are // nevertheless what most of us live in today and with a great deal of satisfaction . The primary community is the more functional in that it has but few institutions and is hence better integrated , but it also provides fewer services . The hard-surface road is reducing or abolishing the primary community , or making it into a weak satellite of the secondary one with its manifold institutional services . The little village of today provides only staple goods , for a pound of sugar or a gallon of gasoline is much the same all over the world . Mass produced merchandise can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities . The withdrawal of the school from the community by road and autobus has left public education without community loyalty , and the centralization of churches is proceeding along the same way . Many rural communities , then , are becoming ghost towns or mere neighborhoods with an expectable increase in rural delinquency and crime . This chapter holds a deep concern for American kin and community . It might be admitted within the social science family , however , that we have succeeded in diagnosing the trouble and failed in curing the ills of either . Man as man has always lived within these twin structures . The separation of kin and community in the secondary type of the latter has required the mountingly expensive if not increasingly efficient services of Community Chests , family welfare agencies , and a host of other highly formalized institutions . More and more Americans are living in unstructured neighborhoods . The adjective American has been emphasized , for such cities as London and Paris are still loose confederations of proud , separate communities . Neither of the two above capitals have what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nostalgia for the past drives Americans to visit the empty shells of formerly successful closed communities  --  Charleston , New Orleans , Williamsburg  --  and shells they are . How much longer can the present drift continue ? How much more time is needed for community planners to come up with something practical ? The only successfully planned communities we can cite is the collection of monasteries on the Greek Mount Athos and that of Valetta on Malta , the only town ever built " by and for gentlemen , " but both of these had strong religious motivation and stern discipline . Three American capital cities were planned , Washington , Madison in Wisconsin , and Columbia in South Carolina , and each developed according to its own ecological inherencies to the confusion of the planners . Could our relative lack of success be due to our love of particularism and unwillingness to see wholes ? 17 Institutions The lives of all of us are being progressively controlled by institutions . More and more even the most intimate parts of our personalities are being hedged about by formalities . Undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the " evil " of dysfunction of our hyperorganization can be exaggerated , but here it is , and all of us must live by it . Only the fortunate man can walk into his gardens and bring z basket of fresh vegetables into the kitchen . Our feeding must be channeled into the organization of some institution . Most of us can not have fun anymore without coming into contact with some great corporation . We can not kiss , cohabit , and procreate with any personality security in this kind of a culture without causing a deal of " paper work " on some official 's part . One suspects that much of the disagreement regarding the scholarly definition of institutions is a bit beside the point . There is a far from unfounded suspicion that we are all talking about the same thing . Most professionals would agree with a colleague should he point to something and say , " That is not an institution , " or waving his hand in another direction assert that another phenomenon meets the qualifications . One wishes that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One often reads of " complex structures , " or of " formal organizations " offered in substitution for an older meaning of institutions . We had best use the traditional term , however , even if it subjects this chapter to the charge of conservatism . Malinowski recognized the vagueness of the term two decades before the present writing , but even he did not venture a substitute . ' The institution is another man1 Bronislaw Malinowski , A Scientific Theory of Culture and Other Essays , Chapel Hill , University of North Carolina Press , 1944 , p. 39 . The advanced student will see in the following discussion much of the influence of William Graham Sumner , Folkways : A Study of the Sociological Importance of Usages , Manners , Customs , Mores , and Morals , Boston , Ginn and Company , 1906 . Sumner only sketched the characteristics of institutions in this early work . His great intellectual honesty would make him change his writing were he alive today . Despite our greater knowledge of the phenomenon and acknowledging the surface nature of this epoch-making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained . // making concept unshared with nonman . The traditional term fits all known human societies . None of the substitutes presently proffered seem to do this . Malinowski recognized this universality and saw that wherever one meets them , institutions have structural similarities no matter what their goal or function may be , or whether in civilization or in " primitive " societies . This book would venture the existence of a telestic inherency in the search for order . If this is not the reason for such similarity in structure , what is ? It is too much to ask that diffusion explain this universality . The following features will be found in every society . An institution is a ritualized system of groups in equilibrium organized around goals considered too important to trust to informality . This definition is offered as a tentative working tool , agreeing that the final one has yet to be devised . First , let us consider a few things which , though commonly called institutions , do not fall within the meaning of this chapter . Note , before this discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not used . What other kinds of institutions are there ? One is often tempted to view an ant hill as an institution , what with its division of labor and differentation in role and status . An institution , however , is a culturally achieved homeostasis , and whatever an ant colony might once have been , it is an instinctive equilibrium for this and many million years in the past . An institution is perhaps man 's greatest effort in symbolics , which by the definition rests on the fact of the conditionable response . Second , an institution is not some particular person . One hears remarks like , " Franklin Roosevelt was president so long that he became an American institution , " or " There goes the good dean . He is an institution around here . " Institutions consist of groups of personalities , and no one person fulfills the requirement . The two worthies just mentioned were or are functionaries within certain institutions , and it does them no honor to brand them with a term which will not hold up in either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one hears someone ask while driving through the country , " My , what impressive buildings ! What educational ( or Catholic , Lutheran , medical , penal , or industrial ) institution is that ? " The term institution refers to persons in the service of groups of people and not to buildings . It is always and everywhere characteristic of institutions to own property when they can and if there is anything available for possession . Indeed , ownership of much property and other valuable materials is diagnostic of institutional strength , but the owned is not the owner . One great weakness of modern American marriage is its reduction in property ownership . The French Republic has easier divorce laws than any American state , but it is based on property , not " love . " Married couples think more than twice before dividing up a farm , a drug store , or some other business . Indeed , American law is never more meddlesome than when the common property of a family , corporation , or church has to be disposed of upon the dissolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewpoint , one can speak of the " institu // tion of slavery , " or " the institution of private property . " These are legitimate terms , insofar as they refer to what has been proclaimed by the law , but they are not institutions in the social science meaning . The last sentence above gives the first clue to the position of this book . There is no need to depart as far from dictionary meanings as some writers seem to think . First and foremost , an institution is something which has been instituted . This means that its existence has been proclaimed , that it is enforced by authority , power , or agreement among the clients . An institution has a " before the public " aspect . Is , therefore , a secret marriage an institution ? It is not . It is a legalized technique of occasional cohabitation which is hard to define . Is an institution a series of social positions , or " sets " in equilibrium , a structure of roles and statuses ? Yes , an institution has both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is a " troupe " of " cannons " or pickpockets an institution ? It is a system of roles and statuses , a hierarchy of skills , with its " wire " or the man who does the actual stealing , his assisting " close up " and " stalls . " There is a certain secrecy , however , an utter lack of the " before the public " aspect , an absence of public proclamation which forbids the name to such a troupe . Likewise , one ordinarily can not call a criminal syndicate an institution , although it may have every other feature found in the following paragraphs . By contrast , if it openly " pays off the nut " ( contributes to the police and politicians ) , if it lets it be known that it will provide narcotics , prostitutes , and opportunity to gamble , there is a certain public proclamation in this which pushes it very close to the border of an institution , no matter what the official law norms say . Some of these criminal organizations actually have greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If one is to agree completely with many of the structural-functional sociologists , furthermore , in viewing an institution as a complex of " institutionalized " ( that is , widely accepted , deeply internalized , and sanctioned ) norms , a criminal syndicate , or even a gang , fits the requirement . The staff and line of such organizations had better internalize their norms . They are rigorously and ballistically sanctioned . Institutions do have norms which operate in patterns . These norms , however , are not the system . They are system maintenance devices . Indeed , we might agree with Sumner that institutions which grow out of former moral norms are strong . Much of what we regulate by institutions was once merely a matter of morality . The juvenile court is a case in point . In former times , most parents could be depended upon to regulate their own children enough of the time to keep them from interfering with the larger society . Having summarized our analysis thus far , we may proceed to the next characteristic of - institutions . Institutions represent man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior in areas which the particular society thinks are paramount and necessary . It , therefore , institutes certain procedures . Institution of these procedures requires general knowledge of them , which does // not mean that all the workings of an institution are made public . Far from this , for all of them have strong enough in-group attitudes to keep many of their proceedings secret from the outside . What is required is that the social environment external to the institution be made sufficiently aware of it as to admit its existence . This does not mean that the rest of the environment seeks to join the institution , or even approves it . Bachelors and spinsters admit the existence of the institution of marriage . Free thinkers admit the fact of the Roman Catholic Church , or that of the Latter-Day Saints . Institutions are organizations , whatever else they may be . System making , or organization , lies at the root of all strictly human behavior . This is true even for individuals , for a personality is an individual 's life pattern by which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even a relatively ineffective personality may blunder into the functional and avoid the dysfunctional most of the time , or at least until crisis hits him . This might even be said of some loosely structured groups of friends , but not for long . Any group is an action system , and action implies the existence of goals around which the activity is oriented . Even friendly recreational groups must organize , and organization requires clear definition of the ends sought , and if any success is anticipated , structure of a kind must exist . Does this mean , then , that all organized groups are institutions ? It certainly does not , for there is a threshold to be crossed between many goal-directed group structures and institutions . All institutions are organizations , but not all organizations are institutions . No one should read an implication in these paragraphs that once an institution is formed around goals considered too important to trust to informality , informal groups in the same area cease to exist . Indeed , the heavier the formalities press upon the operating workers of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just for convenience , sometimes out of protest . A large scale formal organization transacts so much in a secondary manner that persons concerned must form primary groups in their own defense , or for personality satisfaction . Thus , a number of employees of a large firm may form a car pool whereby they may economically , efficiently , and companionably go to and from work daily . These people may well form a conviviality group for after-hours recreation , perhaps including the wives of the members . All of this has nothing to do with the formality , the institution which they serve . This is no more than a clique . A clique , as has been seen , is essentially a flight from formality . If , however , the group seeks to protect itself from the overall institution , or if it should surreptitiously attempt to direct the policy and operation of the institution , the management may have an incipient power structure on its hands which will bear watching . Apparently this scrutiny is in process , for there exists an impression that the sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for them . The structural functional sociologists tend to call what is described // here as institutions by the term formal organizations . There is no important disagreement here . It is agreed that all institutions are both organizations and are formal ones at that . Formality is merely a matter of degree and is a term of wider meaning than the phenomenon of bureaucracies . Is a small family of parents and three children a formal organization ? It is organized if it hopes to survive , and it is a formal system , too . As was said before , it took much paper work on the part of officialdom to bring it into being and much more to dissolve it . This is just as true of the small family as it is of a huge corporation , except in degree . Developing the concept of organization , one must see what is organized . It was seen that any group is an organized action system , but this does not make it an institution . An institution consists of more than one group or subgroups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surely , when groups band themselves , or even bind themselves together to delegate part of their welfare to persons outside the constituent groups , one is looking at an institution . We ask , then , is a modern supermarket an institution ? It is indeed , and the groups oriented around it are the families and other structures which comprise its clientele . It is a structure based on secondary transaction , for these families ordinarily do not know each other . Is , then , such a vast financial institution as the National City Bank of New York an institution , binding as it does a series of groups to itself by services ? It is indeed a secondary homeostasis of commercial and industrial firms who seek credit from it . Now , by contrast , is a small , nuclear family an institution , a series of groups in some sort of homeostasis ? It is indeed and one composed of subgroups . The married couple and the older children constitute a control group and the younger ones a controlled one . Is , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It is not . Indeed , it is not even a group . While it is a highly satisfactory arrangement for thousands of wholesome personalities , it is neither a group nor an institution . Only by being a dependency of an extended family can it acquire some institutional standing . While satisfactory as an affectional device , it is also a weak one , as the divorce statistics reveal . What , then , lies back of all this organization ? An institution is a response to the felt needs , or wants , of its clientele . These are called goals in this book , although the older term of functions serves almost as well . Man is a goal-directed being . Institutions are effective devices directed towards goal attainment . They do not and must not exist for their own sakes , for this is a decadence which contains its own doom . An institution must exist only for the service of its clientele . Actually , a strong institution has many goals , although it will usually discuss but one in its myth . A university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs of its state . It rarely asks for research money , which many legislators look upon as subsidized idleness . It is nevertheless a recreational institution too , spending vast sums on stadiums and other athletic entertainment devices . It gives theatricals and pro // vides a student union . It constitutes one of the surest means of social climbing and status reinforcement . It has flippantly been called a matrimonial agency , and in part , this is true , and a rather successful one at that . Marriages between classmates produce very stable unions , far above the national average . An institution which is adding goals is one growing in strength , and one losing them is weakening . Thus , at one point in its mediaeval history , the Christian Church not only had a monopoly of spiritual functions , but also those of poor relief , care of the sick , most of the entertainment , education , the administration of such civil law as there was , and in some cases of banking credit . What has this come to now ? At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his affectional and personality needs through the family , but those of economic production and consumption , much of his needs for recreation , education , protection , and status . What has this come to today ? And , by contrast , to what proportions has government risen ? An institution may well seek to be all things to all its clientele , or at least to its own staff . If it can maintain a monopoly in one phase of the lives of either its clientele or its workers , it can well establish one in all else . There is a body of American folklore about " the company store , " all but dead today , but if a large farm , a textile mill , a mine , or any other enterprise can control the consumption as well as the productive activities of its workers , can say where and how they shall live , how they shall obtain credit , and on what terms , it is playing a well nigh divine role . In this day of increasing " fringe benefits " to workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is the corporations who are resisting . The corporations might wake up to see that they are controlling life , health , and other insurance , that they are the source of entertainment and recreation , and realize that they could make the company store look like child 's play . The workers would then have only their unions to protect them . It is nevertheless characteristic of tangent bureaucracies to cooperate rather than to compete . There have already been some significant " deals " in this direction . These goals are obtained through procedures which have been called rituals in other pages . Indeed , an institution operates through ritual , for it has no other technique , and lucky is the one which can so induce such " internalization " in its subordinates and clients that these rites could be called magical . Far from confining the term ritual to the operation of religious and other ceremonial bodies , a bank also uses them , for it can not keep open otherwise . The ritual , as said before , is mankind 's greatest device for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is general agreement that an institution is a pattern of formalities . The norms , then , are the static aspect of formality , while the rituals are its dynamic . Among other things , the rituals of an institution are its norms in action . One has already seen that rituals are not the exclusive property of institutions . The minor behavior patterns called etiquette norms are also rituals . An institution is such an important action system , however , that the
