The stealing of art has become such a popular pastime with the highbrow underworld that it has also become-as news , at least-a bit of a bore . But last week 's heist from the respected O'Hana Gallery in London was the biggest in British history . Gone from the gallery 's choice " Summer Exhibition " were 35 paintings , including works from the recently sold Sir Alexander Korda collection , Renoir 's magnificent Andree Assise from the Somerset Maugham collection , and the well-known Tilling the Vineyard , by Toulouse-Lautrec . The market value of the haul was estimated at about $1,200,000 , and the thieves were obviously connoisseurs . They not only took the best ; they also knew which paintings were too delicate to be cut from their frames and would have to be taken frame and all . Said one insurance assessor working on the case : " I would call this a masterpiece of crime . " <P> Scotland Yard put all harbors and airports on the alert , but it did so with a suggestion of quiet desperation . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen from the National Gallery eleven months ago , has yet to be found .
