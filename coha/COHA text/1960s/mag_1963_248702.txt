At Jasna Gora monastery , the most sacred shrine in Poland , Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski last week blasted grow ing Communist efforts to curtail church activities . Speaking to groups of the more than 100,000 pilgrims gathered to celebrate the Feast of the Assumption , the cardinal cited a government ban on organized pilgrimages and pro tested against roadblocks where some pilgrims had been harassed during the trip to the shrine , enduring their own " Way of the Cross . " Ostensibly , the ban resulted from a smallpox outbreak in the vicinity , but there was no inter ference with nonreligious tourists . <P> On another front , the Reds refused to let children at state-run summer camps attend Mass . Said Wyszynski : " The state does not have the right to prohibit everything . If a citizen does not demand his rights , he is no longer a citizen . He becomes a slave . "
