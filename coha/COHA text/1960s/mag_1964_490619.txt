Notes and Comment WE imagine that important executives of the Telephone Company find little time for light reading , and thus may have missed an essay by three physicists called " Strongly Interacting Particles , " which appears in the current issue of Scirraific american . This article is devoted largely to a new system of nomenclature , which aims at imposing a degree of order upon the perplexing crowds of subatomic par-ticks , and thereby making the world 's physicists happier men . On first view , this may not seem to have much to do with the Telephone Company , and yet we believe that there is a lot in the article to reward an executive 's attention . For instance : The bookkeeping on parity is not quite so simple as that for electric charge and baryon number ; the intrinsic parity values on each side of an equation are not necessarily the same . The reason is that the total parity is affected by spin angular momentum as well as by intrinsic parity . The close connection between parity and spin angular momentum makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 and the intrinsic parity P next to each other in describing each particle . For the proton , for example , I equals h and P equals +1 , which is shortened to P equals 72 + . For the pion I equals 0 and P is ? 1 , so that one writes JP equals ( The system of bookkeeping for J is actually quite complicated in quantum mechanics , but the details need not concern us here . ) The executive sees a connection between these terse mysteries and his own work ? No ? We urge him to sample another paragraph : A set of particles or particle states ( we use the terms interchangeably ) related to each other by isotopic-spin symmetry is a charge multiplet and is given a single name . Thus the nucleon doublet consists of the two charge states , positive and negative . The pion triplet consists of nega ? Live , neutral and positive charge states . The number of different charge states in a multiplet , or its " multiplicity " ( M ) , is directly related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2/ + I. For the nucleon M equals 2 and I equals 4 ; for the pion . , 11 equals 3 and I equals 1 . The executive still fails to discern any link ? We must direct him , then , to yet another statement by our authors , who arc , it must be observed , sober men of science  --  men to whom irony is foreign and deliberate overstatement unthinkable . By way of introduction to their nomenclatural system , they say , " Although it may look forbidding at first sight , it is really no harder to master than the telephone company 's all-digit dialing system . " Dali Reapproached ALVADOR DALI , who was repre- sented at the 1939-40 World 's Fair by a Surrealist display called " Dream of Venus " and consisting of six girls in pink bathing suits in a tank of water , has finished a rather large painting ( ten by thirteen and a half feet ) , with a rather large name , " **33;2792;TOOLONG ( Hommage to Crick and Watson ) , " to he shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We inspected it at an exhibit of Dali paintings , drawings , and watercolors at Knoudler 's , where its creator , whom we also inspected , told us that many of the components of its title were also in the picture : his wife , Gala ; The Cid , the hero of his native land ; nucleic acid ; and so on . " The Cid is also Gala , " he said helpfully , waving his cane and twirling his waxed mustache . " If you look carefully , you can also make out God , Christ , Isaiah , and the genetic continuity of memory . This is my best exhibition . It 's the product of the last two years , done at my home , in Port Lligat , on the Costa Brava . I work every day , but my best work is clone in the last five minutes before dinner . Every painting is completely different . Here 's one called Twist in the Studio of Velazquez . ' If you put it in the right light , the people in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prints showing octopuses and young women , and Dali said , " Octopus loves one girl . Octopus loves two girls . I like to eat octopus , but these octopuses are too big to eat . The small ones are delicious . Our place is near the water , and Gala has four boats for fishing . Elle fait beaucoup la pc'ehe . Ie fais la peinture . She has one boat for deep-sea fishing ; one boat for fishing little things in the bay , such as langowtes ; one boat for promenade ; and one boat for ? Oh , I forget . They 're all painted yellow . They all have motors , and we have a man to run them . I swim fifteen minutes a day , and in the night I receive friends . I 've just finished writing a hook about ' The Angelus ' of Millet . It 's a most erotic painting . This is not generally known . " We congratulated Dali on the durability of his mustache , which first impinged on this department 's consciousness in 1941 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crosby , in Bowling Green , Virginia , he was complaining bitterly about the neighborhood grasshoppers . He replied , " The mustache is really too small . I have a bigger , artificial one , which I wear over it on special occasions . The artificial one goes on the real one with artificial glue . You spray it with a little humidity , and it moves . It moves slowly for fifteen minutes . I reserve it for dinners and receptions . I myself move very little . I rarely leave the Costa Brava when I 'm in Spain , and here I rarely move from the St. Regis . I 'm staying for the opening of the Fair . I 'm going to do portraits of some very beautiful ladies and some of their beautiful children . I 'm still tremendously afraid of grasshoppers . The grasshopper is the only animal I 'm afraid of . I suppose it 's a sexual complex . " ? INCIDENTAL INTELLIGENCE : Under the heading " Imperial Palace " in the Ethiopian Telephone Directory , which is printed in English , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department . Slalom WE missed the slaloms at Innsbruck last week , hut , on the other hand , we recently accepted a rather bizarre invitation from the White Rose Tea people to take a trip over to the National Ski Fair , at the Statler Hilton , and watch a slalom that they happened to be sponsoring in the Grand Ballroom . The slalom , the invitation informed us in the most disarmingly-casual tone , would take place in the afternoon , on a carpeted redwood-andaluminum mountain , and the slalom markers would , of course , be giant tea bags . Now , the construction of a mountain inside a ballroom , carpeted and tea-bagged to commercial majesty , struck its as a ne-plus-ultra feat of press-agentry , so , in line with our continuing research into that gentle and subliminal art , we headed fur the Statler , pad in hand . The Grand Ballroom and its environs were as busy as a Sugarbush gondola lift when we arrived at three  --  an hour before the fair was to open officially . Exhibitors were still at work filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoots , and poles as space allowed . Hertz was in the process of wheeling a rent-a-car car , fitted with a rent-a-ski-rack ski rack , through the crowds and into its allotted corner of the room . New York Life was hanging a gay blue ski-disability-insurance banner on one wall , and Sears ' Ski Shop was attempting to fashion a jazz-band instrument from an old washboard and a hall of twine . Models in the latest apr  --  s-ski creations were strolling about , looking appropriately sportif , , and a score of alarmingly robust young athletes were shouting hearty greetings to one another across the floor . An enormous jungle-gym structure , apparently the mountain  --  or , anyway , part of the mountain  --  that we had conic to see , rose like a Fellini nightmare in the midst of all these small , human goings on . Approximately sixty feet of aluminum jigsaw scaffolding , it began at the ballroom balcony and sloped sharply down to the ballroom flex ? r . Several workmen were crawling around on top of the thing , hammering together a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot of the scaffolding , a second shift of mountain-makers were sitting on a huge roll of white nylon carpeting , which was apparently the snow . " That 's the snow , " a friendly young man from the hale-and-hearty set said as he strolled up to us . He introduced himself as Harry Leonard , the promoter and manager of the fair , and told us that this indoor mountain was part of his own contribution to the science of winter sports . " I 've experimented with it for years , " he said , and added confidentially that he would still take Taos over a manufactured mountain any day . " The snow was the real problem , " he went on . " First I tried heavy wool felt , then powdered borax , then polystyrene plastic . Nothing was ever quite right , though . Then , this year , I hit upon nylon carpeting . The skiers loved it . It 's the perfect snow . " By now it was nearly four , and the ballroom was teeming with newsmen , cameramen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to explain to the newsmen , who were grumbling about deadlines , why the mountain was not finished . " The slope is sectional  --  a prefab , " we heard him tell a television cameraman responsible for a slice of six-o'clock news . " It should take no more than four or five hours to put it together under the very worst conditions . " He motioned toward his workmen , who were now creeping in a phalanx up the mountain , pushing the roll of carpeting ahead of them . " The men today are just a little unsure of what it is they 're building , that 's all , " he continued , and then assured the cameraman that the mountain would he done in half an hour . We took advantage of the delay to explore more of the fair , first stopping for a complimentary cup of tea at the White Rose booth , where a young p. - r. girl in stretch pants told us , " Ski and Tea . See ? , " and then crossing the floor to a Sugarloaf-skidevelopment display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled " How Come School Kids Do n't Play in School No More ? " We thanked the leader of the combo , a full-bearded guitarist , and headed for the exhibit of Ski Country , U.S.A. ? an association of Colorado slope developers  --  where we took in a short movie on powder skiing in the Rockies . Returning by way of a booth that ad-vertised " Skibee Tours for Singles Only " and promised , under a blown-up photograph of cavorting singles , a weekend of " Skiing , Dancing , and Ro-mancing " to all corners , we arrived hack at the mountain just in time to see the workmen roll down the carpet of nylon snow toward some rows of chairs that had been set up for the spectators . There were now hundreds of ski buffs assembled for the slalom , and they were delighted with the swish of the onrush-ing carpet and clapped , calling for more . The girl from White Rose then clam-bered up the slope , barefoot , scattering her tea bags to mark the course , and a man called Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a can of dance-floor wax , which he sprinkled over the carpeting . Next came the skiers  --  three young men in yellow sweaters and bright-blue pants . They herring-boned up the mountain at a good clip , heating both Knowlton and the p. - r. girl to the balcony , and stood poised above the ballroom until Knowlton called " Ach-lung ! Fertig ! Los 1 " ? the international signal for a ski race to begin . Then , one by one , they sped hack down the mountain , nimbly round-ing every tea hag along the way . At the sight of those sharp skis whizzing toward them from the balcony , the spectators ducked and screamed , but the skillful Statler skiers cut to a neat stop several inches from the first row of chairs . Tim Corcoran , who had beaten all the other Americans in the slalom competition at the Winter Olympics three years ago , was pronounced the winner , with a time score of thirteen seconds for the completed course . The p. - r. girl jumped up to present him with a silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a cue from Lel mard , applauded enthusiastically . We left for Seventh Avenue and the great outdoors . ? HELP-WANTED sign posted on the bulletin hoard of the Personnel Department of the University of Minnesota by the Department of Psychiatry and Neurology : LABORATORY TECHNOLOGIST . Qualiflcationst Punctual , compulsive , and intelligent . Film-Maker DAVIID WISE became nine years old on the first of February . When we learned , the other day , that he had just returned from delivering a lecture at Washington and Lec University , in Lexington , Virginia  --  he had shown his thirteen-minute animated film " Short Circuit " to an audience of undergraduates and discussed the art of movie-making with them  --  we called up to ask if he would discuss his art with us . We spoke first to David 's father , who runs the Howard Wise Gallery , on West Fifty-seventh Street , and then to David 's mother . Mr. and Mrs. Wise said David would talk to us any afternoon when he got home from the Collegiate School , where he is in the fourth grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-story red brick house on West Thirteenth Street , at four-thirty of a dark , wintry day , and were greeted at the door by Mrs. Wise , David , and David 's dog , a suspicious collie named Sheba . The entrance to the house is dramatic , for the entire first floor is occupied by a single rectangular room , the long walls lined with a selection of modern paintings and sculptures , and the long sweep of wood floor interrupted only by a well in the center , with an iron railing around it . David , a round-faced , serinos-looking young Elm-maker dressed in clean chino slacks , a red wool shirt , and black street shoes , shook our hand solemnly and peered at us in polite silence while Mrs. ' Vise explained that the building had been a rooming house when she and her husband bought it , and that they had remodellvd it completely . " We had the well cut because the basement is only seven feet high , and we wanted to make its ceiling seem higher , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can talk better down there . " She led the way down a flight of open stairs , with the silent David and the protective Sheba following close behind . The basement , which was red-tiled , was also a single , partitionless room but was divided into two work areas  --  a kitchen , in the back , and David 's studio , which was wildly unkempt , up front . Someone had placed a wooden workbench ( with a tape recorder and a phonograph sitting on it ) at right angles to a massive desk , there+ ) defining the space and leaving only a narrow entrance . A handwritten sign posted to the right of the entrance warned : " Detour ! Studio . Stop . Do Not Enter . " Mrs. Wise brought David a glass of Coca-Cola , pulled a chair up for us , and retired unobtrusively to the kitchen . Sheba lay down on the red tiles just outside the studio entrance . David took up a position directly opposite us on the workbench , and we tried to break the ice by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He nodded . " Sure . It 's called ' Triple Spice , ' Would you like to see the title ? " We said we would , and he began rummaging around for it . Besides the desk and the workbench and a variety of shelves and pigeonholes , the studio contained an " animation table " ? a big black camera , with a spotlight attached to each side , that was suspended from a metal armature So that the lens pointed straight down at a hinged glass plate set in the center of a flat metal surface . This surface , like the rest of the studio , was half buried under a compost of comic hooks ( " Batman , " " Spider-man , " " The Fantastic Four " ) , plastic figurines of famous movie monsters ( Frankenstein 's , Dracula ) , realistic scale models of tanks , planes , trucks , and guns , and great piles of drawing paper , used and unused . From one of these piles David extracted a brightly painted sheet of paper with the wavy legend " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device that enclosed the letters " D.W. Inc . " We asked David what the title meant . " Well , " he said , " what makes a movie is action and motion , and when I make motion lines on a page , I take my hand and I go pfft pfft pfft ' or spice spice spice . ' " Grabbing an imaginary pencil , David shuttled his hand back and forth across the page to show how the sounds helped him get the feeling of action onto paper . " You ca n't just take anything and toss it in front of the camera and get a movie , " he said , picking up some crayons and a black rubber spider from the floor and throwing them on the glass plate under the camera . They just lay there . " You have to do something , " David said , throwing his props back on the floor . We asked him what he did . " There are two kinds of animation , " he said , in a slightly changed voice , apparently sensing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's the kind where you make a lot of drawings and then take pictures of them in a row . " Tentatively , we dropped the name of Walt Disney . David nodded . " I made one like that once , for a part of ' Short Circuit . ' I made a hundred and twenty-five drawings , and it took up only six seconds of film . Now I mostly make the other kind . Look at this . " He lifted the glass plate on the animation table and showed us two flexible sheets of transparent celluloid lying one on top of the other . On the top sheet was a picture of a house and on the bottom sheet a jet plane , both painted in what was recognizable as a nine-year-old 's style . " In this kind of animation , you pull one cell across the other , and that 's how you get motion . The cell you pull is called the pan cell . Also , you put the black outline of the drawing on one side of the cell and fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why is that ? " we asked . " So you do n't have to worry so much about going over the edges , " David said , barely masking his impatience at the question . " Now watch ! " He began to tug at the lower left-hand corner of the bottom " cell ; " the jet plane seemed to move across the sky and crash into  --  and right through  --  the house . David provided the necessary sound effect : " Barn ! " We recalled that " Short Circuit , " which we had seen and enjoyed at the Gramercy Arts Theatre , was full of crashing , hanging , and hamming scenes . David said that he had made two other movies , " Efil " and " Sretsnom " ( " Life " and " Monsters " spelled backward ) , but that " Short Circuit " was the only one so far to have a sound track  --  which he recorded one day , without rehearsal , while he was watching a run-through of the print . We asked him whether he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really say I like my own films , " he said . " They take too long to make . I started ' Short Circuit ' when I was six , and it took me until I was seven and a half . Sometimes , after a while , after you make five or six cells , you get sick of it . " He said that his favorite films were the monster movies , like " Godzilla " and " The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms , " that he saw on television . We indicated the comic books scattered around the studio and asked whether they had had any special influence on his movies . " Nnt on my movies , " David said . " Only on my comics . Would you like to see one ? " We said we would , and David , reaching under a pile of discarded " cells " and sketches , dug out a sheaf of papers that had been stapled together into a book . The story described a Catastrophic confrontation between an ordinary Earthman and a nova-hall , from outer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he said , " A sort of a blob , but it 's hotter than white-hot . Do you want me to show you what I got for Christ-mas ? " We said we did . David ran upstairs to get his presents , and while he was gone , Mrs. Wise told us that she and her husband had met twelve years ago in Cleveland , where she was working at the Cleveland Play House and he , a retired paint manufacturer , was just taking up painting on his own . After five years of studying painting , Mr. Wise opened an art gallery in Cleveland . Then , in 1961 , having established his New York gallery , he settled here with his family  --  Mrs. Wise , David , and two sons by a previous marriage . " David has always known artists , " Mrs. Wise said . " When they came to the house , they would draw pictures for him , and he would insist on drawing something for them in return . One friend of ours introduced him to flip hooks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was beside himself until he 'd learned to duplicate the effect . Another friend , a sculptor who is also a film-maker , gave him a cartooning board , and he started to make cartoons , which his father photographed with a second-hand camera set on a tripod . That did n't work out very well , technically , and artists who saw David 's work kept telling us to do anything we could to encourage him , so after he had animated half of ' Short Circuit , ' his father bought him this more advanced equipment . Sometimes he 'll get up at six o'clock Sunday morning and work till noon . His father loads the camera the night before it holds about a hundred feet of sixteen-millimetre color film  --  and the next day David will say , ' O.K. , develop it . ' We never even know what 's on it until it comes hack . David does n't like to plan his movies ; he prefers to just sit down and see what happens . " Mrs. Wise added that three prints of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Film-Makers ' Cooperative , of which David is the youngest member . David hounded down the stairs a moment later carrying two huge plastic toys . He had changed into more comfortable clothes  --  red-and-blue knit slippers , old gray corduroys with a gaping hole in the right knee , and a faded red flannel shirt -- and he set the toys down on the tile floor and proceeded to demonstrate the abilities of Tiger Joe , a three-foot-long remote-con trol model tank that shoots plastic shells across a room , with a puff of white smoke , and Big Lon the Moon Robot , a green monster with blinking red eyes that not only shoots darts but also squirts water and announces ( when a key in his back is turned ) , " I am at your command . I will defend you . " While David was retrieving the expended missiles , reloading Tiger Joe and Big Lou , and calming the uneasy Sheba , we asked him what he wanted to be when he grow up . " I 'm not sure , " he said . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an actor , and then , when I wake up , I think I 'll be a film-maker . " As he spoke , he turned the key in Big Lou 's hack , and the monster 's coffer-grinder voice repeated , " I am at your command . " Then David pressed a button , launching a salvo of darts . COLLOQUY overheard at O. V Henry 's , in the Village , between somebody 's pale , mascaraed daughter and somebody else 's bearded son : " I 'm reading absolutely the dirtiest honk . " " Yeah ? Which one ? " " ' The Old Wives ' Tale , ' by Arnold Bennett . " " ' The Old Wives ' Tale ' ? " " Yes . It 's a paperback edition , and the ink runs off on my hands . "
