THIS week 's cover story is our fourth on Viet Nam in seven weeks . The article on TIME 'S Man of the Year , General William Westmoreland , was immediately followed by a cover story on President Johnson 's peace offensive , and this in turn was succeeded three weeks later by the cover on Dean Rusk and the resumption of bombing raids on North Viet Nam . After a one-week interval , the current story on Viet Nam 's Premier Nguyen Cao Ky focuses on " the other war " - the essential effort to rebuild a devastated nation . To symbolize this in the cover painting , we chose the clasped-hands emblem of AID ( Agency for International Development ) , which appears on all shipments of supplies from the U.S. <P> This unusually heavy concentration of cover stories on a single if historic subject reflects our belief that Americans have not been so deeply concerned with any international crisis since Korea . In fact , the need for reporting and analysis may be even greater , because American public response to the clear-cut Communist aggression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provoke the divisions and doubts of the debate over the confusing Viet Nam conflict . <P> Cover stories about Viet Nam require massive amounts of work at high speed . Hong Kong Bureau Chief Frank McCulloch , who has headed TIME 'S coverage of the war for more than two years , had spent a day in the field with Premier Ky and was having breakfast with him the next morning , a few hours after the Honolulu conference was announced . With five other U.S. correspondents , McCulloch flew to Hawaii with the Premier , who lost $8 at poker during the 13-hour flight . TIME White House Reporter Hugh Sidey and State Department Correspondent Jess Cook arrived from Washington with President Johnson . After covering the conference , McCulloch and Cook were awakened by a dawn phone call informing them that the editors had decided on the Ky cover . The two correspondents interviewed and wrote during the entire trip back to Saigon ; Cook then peeled off to accompany Vice President Hubert Humphrey on his Vietnamese tour . <P> Meanwhile , Correspondent Arthur Zich , who had witnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Cavalry Division , was relieved by Karsten Prager , who flew in from Hong Kong . Also on hand were TIME 'S Pentagon correspondent . John Mulliken , and Stringer Zalin Grant . In the midst of the hectic week , McCulloch learned that his seven-year-old son David had undergone a successful emergency appendectomy in Hong Kong . " The jolt , " said McCulloch later , " was at least partially absorbed by fatigue and activity . " <P> In 30 hours the Saigon team cabled more than 40,000 words , which provided the substance of the WORLD cover and the piece on pacification . Four other stories in the NATION section deal with Honolulu and related issues . Ron Kriss , who wrote the Man of the Year story , also wrote the Rusk article and this week 's principal Viet Nam stories in NATION . Jason McManus , who did the cover on the peace offensive , also wrote this week 's Ky cover , again aided by Researcher Joanne Funger . It will not be their-or TIME'S-last cover on Viet Nam .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
