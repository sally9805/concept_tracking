Pius XII &; the Jews <P> Sir : I did not find the play The Deputy Nov. 1 anti-Catholic . Pope Pius was played in London as a sensitive intellectual , confronted with a moral dilemma to which no other man in recent history was subjected . That the Pope weighed it carefully and had the added political responsibility of determining a buffer against the Communists is also emphasized . What the playwright strongly states is that this religious leader 's first responsibility was to speak out against the liquidation of the Jews , and political considerations should then have followed . <P> The moral analogies prevail today . The choice of man to sneak out or to remain silent is not only for history . One could easily change the characters of Hochhuth 's play and retain only the moral charge . We would then have a play about religious leaders in America confronted with the choice of speaking out or remaining silent on any aspect of man 's inherent rights . <P> DAVID ROTHENBERG New York City <P> Sir : In what way is Pius XII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from Neville Chamberlain 's appeasement to gain " peace in our time " ? <P> ( THE REV . ) RALPH WEINHOLD Milwaukee <P> Sir : It is rather ironic that a person like Rolf Hochhuth can not wait till the " Last Judgment " to discover truth ! Why should he pour more salt on the wounds of World War II by questioning the integrity of a dead man who did so much good for humanity ? <P> JOHN J. MORGAN Washington , B.C. <P> All the Way for Home <P> Sir : TIME 'S excellent portrait of Lord Home clearly indicated that , far from having scraped the bottom of the barrel , Britain 's Tories have reached into the top of the top drawer for a leader who seems to be a sparkling blend of Benjamin Disraeli and Adlai Stevenson . <P> EDGAR H. LEONI New York City <P> Sir : If the British do not appreciate Lord Home , would it be possible to have him run for President of the U.S. ? Our aristocracy at present available to that public office has not managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a quandary as to which of the three poor bets currently available would do the least harm to our future . <P> MRS . B. S. KLAYF Miami <P> Sir : In your article on Sir Alec Douglas-Home , you quote his brother as saying that under Home there will not be the nepotism of Macmillan 's Cabinet . This seems hard to believe , since his very succession could be regarded as nepotism . Lady Macmillan and Sir Alec are cousins . Both are descended from the interesting-looking great-great-grandmother who is holding him in the picture accompanying the article . This ancestress , whom you left unidentified , was Louisa ( 1812-1905 ) , daughter of the 6th Duke of Bedford and wife of the 1st Duke of Abercorn . If her contemporary , Queen Victoria , can be described as the mother-in-law of European royalty , then the duchess was the mother-in-law of the Establishment . At her death , she left 162 descendants . Today they include , aside from Lady Macmillan and Sir Alec , the Duke of Devonshire , Under Secretary of State for Commonwealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lansdown , Minister of State for Colonial Affairs ; the half-Vanderbilt Duke of Marlborough ; and the Duchess of Gloucester , aunt of the Queen .
