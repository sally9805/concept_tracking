By BILL DAVIDSON This week , Jack Benny  --  now in his 1 70th year  --  returns to the legitimate Broadway stage for the first time since 1931 , when he forsook his starring role in Earl Carroll 's Vanities and began his incredible 32-year career in radio and , subsequently , TV . In the Vanities , he did a routine about taking his girl to dinner and she laughed so hard at one of his jokes that she dropped her cafeteria tray . In the current revue Life Begins 01 39 at the Ziegfeld Theater , Benny makes clumsy amorous advances to the beauteous Jane Morgan and just as he is about to suc  --  ceed , he loses out by uncontrollably pausing to examine a huge diamond on her finger through a jeweler 's glass . This led his close friend , comedian George Burns , to exclaim , " For fifty years this guy has been doing the same thing  --  and I guess it works . When 1 was a boy , all the stingy jokes were about Scotchmen . Now they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearances , he 's succeeded in wiping out Scotland . " In the period between the two shows , Benny  --  by " doing the same thing " ? also has succeeded in establishing himself as Cnhat Milton Berle calls The Most Suc  --  cessful Paradox in Show Business . He is the best-paid comedian in the world  --  he gets 53,000,000 for three years for his CBS television series alone  --  and he is beloved by millions of fans in dozens of countries , yet he often presents the image of a lonely , troubled man . He is seen walking alone about the streets of Holly  --  wood or Beverly Hills or disconsolately playing golf by himself at the Hillcrest Country Club . He gets into his car , from time to time , and drives to Palm Springs or Chicago or even to New York with no one accompanying him to disturb his solitude . At home he used to lock himself in his bathroom and play his 525,000 Stradivarius violin for hours every day . When the noise wrought havoc on the nerves of his wife Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mansion , and now he plays in the room once inhabited by his daughter , Joan . A second facet of the Benny paradox is his agelessness , Some people refuse to be  --  lieve that he is much older than the 39 he professes to he on the stage  --  and yet nearly all of his contemporaries ( Groucho Marx , Eddie Cantor , Will Rogers , Fred Allen , Phil Baker ) have either passed from the scene or arc in total or semiretirement . To the adoring throngs at Broadway 's Ziegfeld Theater  --  and the fans who keep him in or near the Top 10 in the TVratings  --  Benny may be an anachronism , but they do n't care . Ex-vaudeville comic Sid Silvers , who used to work with Benny in the 1920 's , told me , " When I see Jack get up on a stage today , he looks like the same guy I saw forty years ago on the stage of the old Palace Theater in New York . " Except for bags under the eyes  --  which are cleverly concealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and physique have remained unravaged by time . Only the hands , gnarled and liver-spotted , and the fin  --  gernails gnawed to the skin line , betray his age . His perennial youthfulness is a mystery even to Benny , who offstage is prey to diabetes , crotchetiness , hypo  --  chondria and other afflictions of the near-septuagenarian . " I du n no , " he recently told me with questionable logic , " maybe I look so young because I got such good writers and I always follow their script . " ( Two of his writers , Sam Perrin and George Balzer , have been with him for 19 years ; two others , Al Gordon and Hal Goldman , joined him 14 years ago . He still refers to Gordon and Goldman as " the new writers . " ) Benny , the paradox , has been a million  --  aire for many years . When his daughter Joan married for the first time , the head-line in the Los Angeles Times read : BENNY WEDDING COSTS 160,000 , and the headline in the Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the comedian and said , " Jack , read the Examiner this morning and you 'll save 510,000 . " Benny , the super-shrewd business en  --  trepreneur  --  who is known in Scotland as " The Meanest ( stingiest ) Man in Amer  --  ica " ? has been known to haggle over the price of a suit of clothes and sometimes is influenced in consummating big deals by such extraneous factors as the sourness of his stomach . George Burns says , " It 's hard to be  --  lieve , but Jack nearly turned his back on that $3,000,000 contract under which he is now doing his show at CBS . One day , a couple of years ago , I mei him at the Hillcrest Country Club , where we both play golf . He had just come off thecourse . He was tired and dragging his feet and grousing . He said , My agent wants me to sign a three-year deal with CBS to do a show every week . Who needs it ? ' I said , ' How was your golf game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst . I could n't hit my hat . ' " Continues Burns , " Tau days later I met Jack at the club again and he looked great . I said . ' Jack , how was your golfgame ? ' He said , ' I never played better . hit the ball a mile . ' I said , ' How about that CBS contract ? ' He said , ' The great  --  est ! I 'm going into Hollywood to sign it right now . ' " Benny , the paradox , may be careless and blase enough to let his golf game in  --  fluence such monumental personal de  --  cisions , and yet he was shrewd and gen  --  erous enough in 1956 to realize the po  --  tential for charity of his admittedly dreadful violin playing . In that year , per  --  forming with Alfred Wallenstein and the Oklahoma City Symphony and later with Wallenstein and the Philharmonic Sym  --  phony in New York , he raised $106,000 to aid retarded children and to help save Carnegie Hall . Since then his mock-serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receives not one cent in com  --  pensation  --  have brought in nearly three and a half million dollars for various charities , for musicians ' pension funds and for the continuing existence of the symphonies themselves . The Baltimore Symphony , for example , admits that it would have gone out of business if it had not been for $42,800 attracted by " Jack Benny , Soloist , " at a concert in 1962 . Benny is the most assured man in show business when he is working on a stage and is , as Ed Wynn says , " the world 's finest comedian  --  comedian meaning a man who says things funny , as opposed to a comic , who says funny things . " According to George Burns , " Jack can just drink a glass of water and people will laugh . He does n't need jokes , 1 guess . He 's got funny water . " When he 's offstage , however , Benny 's insecurities take over . For example , he said to me , " I feel a terrible loss about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good vocabulary , but 1 never use it . 1 know too much about show business and not enough about every  --  thing else . I 've lived in the same house for twenty-five years , and I still do n't know where things are or how to fix a loose screw . 1 do n't know what 's going on in the world . 1 try to read at night to educate myself , but I 'm so tired from working so hard that I fall asleep . " And yet Benny , who tortures himself about his lack of education and knowl  --  edge , manages to hold his own in con  --  versations with such friends as Harry Truman , Pablo Casals , Richard Nixon and Henry Ford II . In 1952 he so en  --  thralled Queen Juliana and Prince Bern  --  hard of The Netherlands that the royal couple prevailed upon him to spend three days with them as their solitary guest in their palace . He delights Pres  --  ident Kennedy , with whom he meets and corresponds occasionally . Recently , as a gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar bill in it . The President replied in his ow n handwriting , on plain ruled paper , saying he was sure that Benny had sent 5750 in the money clip but that Peter Lawford , the bearer of the gift , had removed 5749 of it for himself . In his doubts about himself , Benny  --  who thinks every comedian is funnier than he is  --  falls prey to his colleagues ' needling . When he played with the Phil  --  harmonic Symphony in New York , for example , Jackie Gleason sent him a huge gift-wrapped box of rosin for his violin bow  --  enough to satisfy the needs of all the symphony orchestras in the world for the next 100 years . One of the great frus  --  trations of Benny " s life is that he ca n't make George Burns laugh offstage  --  a plight which Burns carefully promulgates . Once , Benny sent Burns a 50-word tele  --  gram embodying the funniest joke he could think of . Burns ' reply was : - DO N'T WORRY . f WO N'T SHOW YOUR WIRE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hotel in Minneapolis , and Burns phoned from the lobby saying he was on his way up to the room . Benny says , " 1 decided once and for all that I was going to make him laugh . I stripped and stood there with a book on my head , a glass of water in one hand and a flower in the other . There came a knock on the door , I yelled , ' Come in ' ? and do you know what that terrible man did ? He sent the maid ahead of him . " Burns , of course , entered imme  --  diately thereafter  --  poker-faced as usual . In his current Ziegfeld Theater show Benny devotes a full eight minutes of monologue to describing such indignities heaped upon him by " that terrible man , George Burns . " And therein , according to Benny 's friend , conductor Johnny Green , lies Benny 's genius . Says Green , " The secret of Jack 's continuing success for all these years is that he knows his own weaknesses  --  which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us have  --  and by exaggerating them slightly , he converts them into universal humor . He 's everyone 's patsy , the pseudo-sophisticate who does n't get away with it , the clumsy poseur who is constantly halted by small obstacles , " His concerts with the symphony or  --  chestras constitute one of the finest comedy acts I 've ever seen , because there is truth , as well as that matchless combi ? nation of humor and pathos , in a Jack Benny , who does n't play the violin very well , sawing away as hard as he can and trying to keep up with the finest musicians in the world . It 's really not an act . It is Jack Benny and he 's willing to be absurd in order to catch that element of truth which all of us see in some preposterously ambitious uncle or some other relative . He 's lasted so much longer than all the others because  --  without resorting to slapstick or pratfalls or jokes  --  he can make people identify with his slightly  --  larger-than-life-size descriptions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his long . sometimes frustrating life . " The seeds of the Benny puzzle  --  the strange mixture of security and in  --  security , the moods , the talent , the point of view  --  can be found in his early years . Born Benjamin Kubelsky , the son of Orthodox Jewish immigrants , he was subjected , as a boy , to the bewildering combination of love and unintentional abandonment which was standard among parents of that generation and back  --  ground , Nothing was too good for the child , but both parents usually struggled so hard to provide the good things that they shortchanged their child in the most precious commodity  --  their presence . Benny 's father at first owned one of the toughest saloons in Waukegan , Illinois , but rapidly switched to the safer con  --  fines of a dry-goods store after his head was laid open by a drunk swinging a pool cue as a weapon of protest . Benny 's mother had to help out in the dry-goods store ; and the boy , left pretty much to himself , grew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons of immigrant Jew  --  ish parents at the turn of the century , he was forced to take violin lessons  --  in the expectation that he would grow up to be a world-renowned concert artist . The violin , however , led Benny only to the orchestra pit of Waukegan 's Barrison Theater , where he got an eight-dollar  --  a-week job when he was only 15 and still wearing knickers . " It was n't that 1 was so interested in the theater , " recalls Benny . " It 's just that it gave me something to do . " In any event , the job  --  because he had to play at afternoon matinees  --  resulted in his being expelled from school and eventually in his separation from his family at the age of 17 . The leader of the Barrison Theater orchestra , an old vaude  --  villian named Cora Salisbury , bought Benny a pair of long pants and formed a touring vaudeville act in 1911 called " Salisbury and Benny  --  From Grand Opera to Ragtime . " Miss Salisbury played the piano and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both backstage and in the audience , began to pay attention to him for the first time in his life , and as Benny puts it , " That , I guess , is what hooked me for show business . " By 1913 ? before Gregory Peck , Presi  --  dent John F. Kennedy or Dr. Jonas Salk were even born  --  Benny was heading up his own piano-and-violin vaudeville act , " Benny and Woods , " on the old Orpheum Circuit . He was making $200 a week with his partner , Lyman Woods , just for playing spirited renditions of the popular tunes of the day . He was yet to utter his first comedy line in public . This did not come until 1918 , during World War I , when he enlisted in the Navy and was assigned to the Great Lakes Naval Train  --  ing Station . " A man named David Wolff wrote a sailor revue , and I was called in to do my violin act with a pianist named Zez Confrey . Wolff wrote a two-line part in the script for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He asked me to read the lines and I delivered them in my usual flat tones . Everyone else was hamming it up , so I guess my delivery sounded funny by contrast . Any  --  way , Wolff began adding on to my part until 1 ended up as one of the leads in the show . " This was the beginning of Benny 's career as a comedian . After the war he went out on the vaudeville circuits as " Jack Benny , Aristocrat of Humor . " He needed his violin " I thought that up , " Benny told me , " but 1 did n't even know what it meant . Then I changed the name of my act to ' A Few Minutes With Jack Benny ' to make it a little more modest , 1 was so scared and insecure that I continued to work with my violin , even though 1 only used it at the end of the act to play myself off with some little jazz number . While I did my monologues I held onto that violin like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crutch for Jack , " recalls George Burns , " that I 'll never forget the first time he tried to work without it . We were in Wilkes-Barre , where the coal miners used to come into the theater with the lights still on in their hats , and you could n't tell where the l'ootlights ended and the audience began . Just to be sure , Jack left his violin at the hotel , He came onstage and told his first joke , but the coal miners were still adjusting the lights in their caps , I guess , and they did n't laugh . Jack told two more jokes  --  and still no laughs . Then , white as a sheet , he leaned over the orchestra pit and asked the conductor , ' Could you please lend me a violin ? ' The conductor obliged and clutching the violin , Jack started all over again . Now he was fine . After that experience , it was another three years before he put the violin away and was able to work without it . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing the famous Palace Theater in New York and touring with such notables as the Marx Brothers , Nora Bayes , Frank Fay and Lou . Holtz , Benny developed all the characteristics that distinguish his humor today . He learned that he could get laughs by telling the audience about things that actually had happened to him , such as his ordeal in reaching the theater from his hotel through a newly installed network of one-way streets . He talked about his own stinginess  --  it had taken him a long time to get over his poor childhood  --  his lack of success with women , the way he was always a foil for the pranks of his friends . By 1925 Benny was making well over 5750 a week with his formula . He con  --  tinued , however , to be a strange and shy young mart . Milton Berle told me , " There were some tough theaters in those days , like one on 14th Street and another on 125th Street in New York , where the hums hung out . They 'd heckle us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with them with quips and jokes . Jack never could master this . I remember one time he took a train down from Buffalo to play a split week at the 125th Street house . He walked on the stage from the left and said , ' Hello , folks , ' which was the way he opened his act . Just then a guy yelled something obscene and threw a tomato . Jack walked across the stage , said , ' Good-bye , folks , ' exited , and continued directly to the 125th Street railroad station , where he took a train back to Buffalo , " George Burns says , " I do n't know what it is , but even in those days Jack thought everything I said was the most hilarious thing he ever heard . Once , in front of the Palace Theater in New York , I made an ordinary remark about our agent , Tom Fitzpatrick , and Jack broke up . He dropped to his knees on the side  --  walk and began heating his fists on the pavement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said to them , ' What 's that guy laughing about ? ' as if I did n't know him . When he realized what I was doing , he laughed even harder  --  and almost got arrested as a nut . " On the other hand , as funny as he was onstage , he developed an inferiority complex about the gags he tried to pull offstage , which never worked . We all lived in the Forrest Hotel on 49th Street in New York in those days , and Jack was courting a girl on the third floor . One day he tried to impress her with his humor . He put on long paper eyelashes , turned his hat inside out and burst into her room . But the girl had checked out the night before , and Jack found himself in there with four total strangers star  --  ing at him . That was the way nearly all his offstage jokes turned out . It was pathetic . " Jesse Block , now a New York stock  --  broker but then a top vaudevillian  --  his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interesting reminiscence of the first time he met Benny . Says Block , " George Burns took me up to Jack 's room in the Forrest Hotel and left me there because he had to go to the theater . Jack was dressing for a date . As he dressed , I told him how great I thought he was on the stage and how delighted I was to meet him . He seemed to be listening to me , but when he finished dressing , he just walked out the door , and I could hear him lock  --  ing it behind him  --  with me inside . He had forgotten all about me . I was stuck in the room until he came home at two a.m . How could I call down to the desk clerk and tell him that one of their ten  --  ants had locked me in his room ? " Benny had an active but inconclusive romantic life in those days . By the lime he was 32 all his close friends were married ( Burns to Gracie Allen and Block to Eve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in love with show business , " says one acquaintance , " and we did n't think there was any girl who could compete with the profession in which he received so much adulation . " But then Benny met Sadie Marks , the younger sister of the wife of a fellow vaudevillian named Al Bernovici . She disliked show business  --  she was selling hosiery in a Los Angeles department store when Benny met her  --  but she was impressed with the suave and gentle  --  manly comedian . He liked her icono  --  clastic sense of humor . A few months later , in January , 1927 , they were mar  --  ried . Several months after that , despite resentments against the unreal world of show business , Benny had pressed her into service as part of his act . She as  --  sumed the role of a bubble-headed girl against whom Benny played some of his funniest comedy skits . She took the name Mary Livingstone ( Mary has been her first name ever since ) and Benny was doing an act with his wife ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other guys . " The act prospered , Benny got a con  --  tract with M-G-M during which he made such long-forgotten film epics as Chasing Rainbows and The Medicine Man , and finally he returned to Broadway in triumph as a 31,500-a-week star of Earl Carroll 's Vanities . In 1931 , knowing that Mary was sick of touring , he left the vanities when it made ready to go on the road , and he took a flyer in the infant medium , network radio . His first appear  --  ance was as guest on an Ed Sullivan intcr  --  view show in which he opened with the now-historic show-business lines : " Hello , folks , this is Jack Benny . And now there will be a pause for all of you to say , ' Who cares ? ' " A few weeks later he had a regular show of his own . For 32 years thereafter  --  without interruption  --  he has done a weekly radio or television pro  --  gram . This is a record not likely to be broken for some time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . George Burns says , " He runs his opera  --  tion like a well-oiled machine . His four writers , his producer , Irving Fein , even his stand-in , Ned Miller , do their jobs under his direction , and they grind out his shows with no sweat or frenzy . " Compared with other stars ' lavish working quarters , Benny 's offices are small , unpretentious and utilitarian . Al  --  though his wife Mary has seven servants at home , Benny has no flunkeys or en  --  tourage . He drives his own car , dresses himself , even does his own makeup . To a Hollywood used to seeing a Frank Sinatra or an Elvis Presley walk about with a palace guard of nine or ten muscle  --  men , chauffeur , valet , makeup man , hair  --  dresser , errand boy , etc. , Benny is a startling sight entering a studio all by himself and ready to go to work . Onstage all his early insecurities are gone . He 's like a skilled editor in rehearsals , pruning , changing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which usually goes off with professional precision . He 's a proud grandfather In his personal life Benny is not so assured . He told me , " I 'm a real moody guy . Sometimes 1 wake up in the morning terribly depressed , and it goes on like that all day . I do n't know why . " After 36 years of marriage to Mary , he is still devoted to her and to their daughter , Joan , and he is the typical proud grand  --  father rolling on the floor with Joan 's children  --  Michael , 7 , and Maria , 5 . " But , " as a friend says , " there have been disappointments . You know how Jack values the education he never had , but Joan , a brilliant student , left Stanford University to get married before she graduated . This hasty marriage ended in divorce , and so did her second . Mary , who was always terrified of performing , got to be a nervous wreck in the last years she worked with Jack . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About six years ago , she finally had to retire from show business . Now she de  --  votes herself to making their home a showplace and is adding to her reputa  --  tion as one of the best-dressed women in Hollywood . Jack , whose whole life is show business and who has always wanted Mary to be as wrapped up in it as he is , misses her as he goes about his work . " At about the same time that Mary re  --  tired , a strange thing happened to Benny . He had come up with an idea for one of his television shows  --  a dream sequence in which he imagined he was a great concert violinist . In order to do the show , he had to take violin lessons again , be  --  cause he had done little more than scratch out Love in Bloom on the instru  --  ment in the 30 years since he had aban doned the " crutch " of his early vaude  --  ville days , He did the show , but he was so fascinated that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has practiced two or three hours a day . " I find that it is therapy for me , " he says . " Whenever I feel troubled or depressed , I play the violin , and the bad mood goes away . " He plays the violin at home and he has set up a music stand in his office so he can practice there . Last summer he bor  --  rowed Kirk Douglas 's home in Palm Springs , drove there alone in his Rolls-Royce and did nothing but play the violin for three weeks . He says . " I came back refreshed . " Fiddling for Carnegie In 1956 his friend , the renowned con  --  cert violinist , Isaac Stern , suggested that he do a concert in New York with the Philharmonic Symphony in order to raise money to save Carnegie Hall . Benny said , " That 's ridiculous . The soloist should be you or Jascha Heifetz . " Stern replied , " Ah , but neither Heifetz nor I can draw an audience paying a hundred dollars a ticket . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit , He played Beethoven out  --  rageously , argued with the conductor , demanded that the concert master he banished from the stage for playing better than he . Since then , nearly every symphony in the United States has asked Benny to do a similar money-raising con  --  cert , and Isaac Stern , in effect , has be  --  come his concert agent , " When they want Benny , " says Stern , " they ask me : - Sometimes Stern himself plays with Benny in the concerts . They do the Bach ) Concerto Jar Tao Violins in D Minor , and Stern kids him unmercifully on the stage . saying such things as , " Only a Jew who needs money would do this . " Playing with Stern , Benny is more inept than usual . Significantly , however , Benny once did the same double concerto with AnsheI Brusilow , the brilliant young concert master of the Philadelphia Or  --  chestra . Instead of ribbing him , as Stern does , Brusilow treated him with respect and admiration . A musician friend says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night . He simply played his heart out trying to be good . And he ivos good for that one number . He was n't a Heifetz or a Menuhin , but by God , he was good . " And so at the age of 69 , Benny seems to have conic full circle back to the lonely youngster in Waukegan who dreamed of becoming a concert violinist . With all his tremendous success , the violin has become his obsession again . In January I watched him perform with the Beverly Hills Symphony before a sell-out audience of film and television notables . At the intermission , I pushed my way through the crowd , all abuzz with comments about the master 's comic genius . I went to his dressing room , expecting to be surrounded by his wife and daughter and a throng of admiring friends , But Benny was alone . He stood in a corner in his shirt sleeves , all by himself . playing a sad passage from Brahms  --  in perfect tune  --  on his $25,000 Stradivarius violin . THE END  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
