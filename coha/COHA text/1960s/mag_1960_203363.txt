" The country is tired of this bill , and the Senate is tired of this bill , " said Republican Leader Everett Dirksen to a colleague as the civil rights debate dragged toward the end of its second month . " All the political juice has been squeezed out of it . " In the Senate , that once formidable bastion of Southern filibuster and fury , Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson and Minority Leader Dirksen had decided on a course of power and performance . Moving with sure control , they worked to get roadblocks out of the way of the substantial civil rights bill sent over from the House ( TIME , April 4 ) , a bill that notably strengthens Negro voting rights by authorizing federal courts to appoint voting referees . Among the tests met and bested : <P> Senator Estes Kefauver , long a banner-waving Democratic liberal , but running for re-election this year in segregation-prone Tennessee , suddenly chose to attack the vital voting-rights heart of the bill with a crippling amendment . In the Judiciary Committee , Kefauver proposed an amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the voting referee into a public hearing open to challenge by local officials . By the time civil rights partisans realized that this would gut the strongest part of the bill , Dixie Senators had rushed Kefauver 's amendment through committee on a one-vote margin . ( In the confusion , Colorado Democrat John Carroll voted with the Southerners to his subsequent chagrin , and Wisconsin Republican Alex Wiley could not be found to vote at all . ) But on the Senate floor the Johnson-Dirksen team rallied their forces , smashed the amendment by a decisive 69-to-22 vote . <P> Dirksen resolutely reversed his own month-old vote in the drive for unity , voted to make it a federal crime to obstruct any order by a U.S. court-not just an order concerning school integration . Dirksen 's switchover to the broader proposal helped line up a 68-to-20 majority for this amendment . <P> New York Republican Jacob Javits , wheelhorse for the civil rights team , tried to delay Senate action on his proposal giving permanent , statutory standing to the President 's Committee on Government Contracts , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican Dirksen backed Democrat Johnson 's move to force Javits to " stoo talking and start voting . " Red-faced , Javits turned control of his amendment over to Dirksen , who promptly put it up for brief debate , quick defeat by a 48-to-38 vote . <P> Soon after the North 's Javits , like the South 's Kefauver , went down to defeat . <P> Senators adjourned to rest their frayed nerves , prepare for this week 's drive to finish their long-delayed job of buttressing the voting rights of Negroes . So sure of victory was Majority Leader Johnson that he began practicing on office visitors a triumphant address celebrating the final vote .
