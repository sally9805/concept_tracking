 | GADGETS FOR YOUR STEREO : ARE THEY GOOD ? @# If you 've ever doubted that listening to good music at home is as much of a hobby as it is a pleasure , just cast an eve at the assortment of hi-fi accessories that POPULAR SCIENCE has assembled on these pages . We bought them to find out if these gadgets really can improve the sound you hear . Here 's what we learned : Record cleaners . A minute speck of dust looks like a huge boulder to the tiny stylus in your stereo cartridge . Every time the stylus hits a dust speck as it races through a dirty record 's groove , the cartridge generates an output voltage spike that produces crackle and pop . A record attracts dust because of static electricity that builds up on its vinyl surface as it is played and handled . Once dust particles are deep inside the grooves , it 's almost impossible to remove them with an ordinary brush or cloth ? you must use a specially designed cleaner . The three cleaners we tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Record Preener ? all helped to reduce the build-up of static electricity by drawing it off with a moist plush pad . But the sharp-bristled brushes on the Dust Bug and Hush Brush were the most effective in cleaning dusty records . We rate the Hush Brush as the most convenient to use because its built-in reservoir holds a considerable supply of antistatic fluid ; the plush pads of the other two must be moistened before each use . Turntable strobe . If your record player turns too fast or too slow , the music you hear will be off pitch . A strobe light and calibrated strobe disk let you detect ? and monitor ? turntable speed error . The strobe we bought was nothing more than an AC-powered neon-bulb pilot light built into a handle . The bulb flickers on @#  | and off120 times a second ? iii step with the positive and negative voltage peaks in ex 11 cycle of alternating current . The three bands of alternating black-andwhite segments ? one band each for 33 , 45 , and 78 : p.m. - on the strobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , when viewed under the strobe light . if the turntable speed is right . Unless you can recognize perfect pitch , small speed errors probably wo n't bother yon . Large errors that everyone eau hear signal that its time to call a repairman . Consequently , you do n't need a strobe light and disk ? unless your turntable has a speedadjustment control . Stylus-force gauges . If your stereo cartridge rests too heavily on a spinning record , the stylus will wear the grooves unnecessarily . If it rests too lightly , the stylus will not track through the groove properly : The wide groove excursions found during loud passages will jolt the stylus in and out of the groove , producing a buzzing sound . In between , there is a range of optimum styles forces . To learn what it is , write to the manufacturer of your stereo cartridge . The only practical way to set your record player 's tone arum to this optimum force is with the aid of a stylus-force gauge . We tested two types : a spring-scale gauge made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved equally accurate . Tape-recorder strobe . We purchased two kinds ? tape and wheel . Both must be used with a strobe light . Sure they work ? but : The speed at which your tape recorder 's drive motor pulls tape past its magnetic heads is important only if you play prerecorded tapes . Any deviation from a nominal 71 ? or 3% inches per second ( the speeds at which commercial tapes are recorded ) will show up as a pitch error . Yon wo n't detect an error on your own recordings , though , since they are recorded and played back at the same speed on the nine tape machine . Bulk tape eraser . The erase head in your tape recorder just is n't capable of reducing the signal and noise content of prior-used tape down to the levels found on virgin tape ? but a bulk tape eraser is . Our eraser was essentially a heavy AC-powered electromagnet that produces a powerful , largecoverage , alternating magnetic field .

Teh motion of recorded tape past your recorder 's play-back , record , and erase-head assembly slowly magnetizes teh heads . That 's why tape-machine manufactureers recommend that you demagnetize the heads add hiss to the tape moving past them . Since a demagnetizer costs less than one reel of high-quality precorecorded tape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape moves past teh head assembly , minute oxide particles are scraped off and , in time , build up on teh head surfaces . As a result , the tape no longer makes close contact with the heads . The time-honored head-cleaning device is a cotton swab saturated with an alcohol-base head-cleaning solution . Far newer is the tape that you saturate with solution and run through the tape transport like magnetic tape . It works , but the solution may damage plastic and rubber parts , and the rough cloth tape may injure the pressure pads , as the tape feeds through . Tape splicers . You 'll rarely need a splicer unless you edit your recorded tapes . The splicer holds the tape ends in position while you join them with splicing tape . We found that a " free " splicer that 's molded into every seven-inch Kodak tape reel works as well as a splicing kit and a 810 machine . Self-threading reel . This gadget is great fun to watch , but we found a rub : It worked beautifully on a horizontally mounted tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorder . @#
