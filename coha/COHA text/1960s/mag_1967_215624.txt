THE MIDDLE EAST <P> The " gallop past " by the King 's Troop of the Royal Horse Artillery - in which three score plumed cavalry men rattle past at full gallop , swords raised , hooves beating and gun carriages thundering behind - is so intricate and dangerous that it is rarely used even for visiting royalty . Last week Queen Elizabeth , who had never seen the ceremony herself , ordered it performed to mark the state visit of Saudi Arabia 's King Feisal , the somber and bearded monarch who has emerged as leader of the moderate forces op posing the pan-Arabism of Egypt 's Gamal Abdel Nasser . <P> Feisal came to Britain for more than a bit of royal pomp . He fears that when the British protectorate of Aden gets its independence next year , Nasser 's followers will swallow it up once British troops pull out , thus giving his enemy another stronghold on Saudi Arabia 's flank . In discussions continuing through this week , he will try to persuade Prime Minister Harold Wilson to postpone Britain 's troop withdrawal-perhaps indefinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year by terrorists in Aden . Coinciding with Feisal 's trip , Nasserite organizations paralyzed the territory by declaring its eleventh general strike of the year . In Cairo , leaders of a powerful terrorist group named FLOSY ( Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen ) declared themselves Aden 's " government in exile " ; they named a temporary capital at Taiz in Yemen , even appointed a President , 13 Cabinet ministers and two ambassadors ( to the Sudan and Egypt ) . On Cairo radio , FLOSY President Abdul Qawee Mackawee promised Aden " a popular resistance uprising in the coming weeks against imperialists and their agents . " For good measure , Cairo radio also demanded King Feisal 's assassination , calling him " an enemy of God " who is " selling you out to the British in London . " <P> <P> Until now , the British hoped that Feisal could supply the troops to defend the territory once the tommies pull out . But Feisal , who is already supporting anti-Nasser forces in Yemen , is hardly eager for another confrontation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Najran , near the Yemeni frontier , for the third time this year . The British may be getting the point . Last week British Foreign Secretary George Brown appeared in Parliament with a first hint that Britain might at least consider staying on in Aden for a while . It was still the government 's intention to leave , he said , but only on condition that it " leave behind a stable and secure government in South Arabia . "
