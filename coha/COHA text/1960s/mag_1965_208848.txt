Painter of Dreams <P> Sir : Congratulations on your superb Chagall spread July 30 . It is fantastically impressive . <P> RICHARD A. MADIGAN Assistant Director Corcoran Gallery of Art Washington , D.C. <P> <P> Sir : Congratulations . <P> MARTHA BENNETT KING Art Institute of Chicago Chicago <P> Sir : In Chagall you have selected a classic symbol of the decline of the Paris School , the most important creative art center since the Renaissance . Just compare the daring , but successful , lyrical vitality of his 1911-1914 pictures with the decorative boudoir puffs and frills of his post-World War II efforts . The world innovative center for Western art shifted in the 1940s to New York under the influence of noted refugee painters from Europe , such as Mondriaan , Leger and Matta . <P> STEPHEN D. PAINE Boston <P> &para; Not to mention Refugee Chagall . <P> <P> Sir : How could TIME print such meaningless , airy-fairy prose on an artist who foists his polychromatic private hallucinations on the public as art ? <P> KENNETH NARY New York City <P> Sir : Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can paint what many of us can only dream . His universal figures and impressions surpass the barriers of language and age . ( MRS . ) ANN KUPERBERG Elizabeth , NJ . <P> <P> Martian Chronicle <P> Sir : In answer to Reader Rosey 's query July 30 , " Was this trip necessary ? " : I believe that the 1965 Mariner IV trip to Mars was no more necessary than the 1492 Columbus trip to America-but Mariner 's impact on mankind may be greater . <P> P. Y. MATTHEWS Lieutenant Commander , U.S.N. Sandia Base , N. Mex . <P> <P> Sir : The selection of our space scientists as men of the year is mandatory . <P> RICHARD J. KOHOUT Major , U.S.A.F. Eglin A.F.B. , Fla . <P> <P> Work Finished <P> Sir : Re Adlai Stevenson July 30 : I remember his humorous comment after some prefatory remarks at the Harvard commencement last month . He said : " I suppose that I must talk now and you must listen . I do hope that we both finish our work at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished and that we can no longer listen to his eloquent voice . <P> PETER H. NASH Dean , the Graduate School University of Rhode Island Kingston , R.I. <P> Sir : As a conservative Republican , I could not support Stevenson for President . But his sincere , eloquent statesmanship at the U.N . was an example to all . <P> EDWARD E. MONTGOMERY JR . Chicago <P> Sir : May we offer condolences ? To millions the world over , Stevenson represented the finer breed of American and proved that the best man need not always win at politics . <P> SARWAT ALI NUSRAT ALI AZMAT ALI Karachi , Pakistan <P> Sir : Does Artist Boris Chaliapin find it as amazing as I do that his 13-year-old painting of the then Governor should parallel so exactly the photograph taken just seconds before Stevenson 's death ? <P> ( MRS . ) E.
