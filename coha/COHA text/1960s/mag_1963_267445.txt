It is a nice enough coastal town , but , as regards Shakespeare , Connecticut 's Stratford is spotty . In the nine years since its founding , Stratford 's Festival Theater has followed a practice of putting big names in mediocre productions . Katharine Hepburn in 1960 did nothing to salvage a ragged Twelfth Night ; Robert Ryan was a disaster in Antony and Cleopatra . <P> This summer Stratford boasts a production that any Shakespeare theater in the world might prize - a good company with a triumphant King Lear , played by Veteran Character Actor Morris Carnovsky . Fact is , Carnovsky 's Lear is such a popular and critical triumph that last week Stratford canceled two performances of Henry V and one each of Comedy of Errors and Shaw 's Caesar and Cleopatra to give Lear a longer run . <P> Something Superhuman . At 64 , Carnovsky has played many of the classic character parts - Shylock , Prospero and Chekhov 's Uncle Vanya . But Lear , obviously , is something else again , and Carnovsky says that when the role was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , he says , " demands almost super human strength . The actor must learn to tell the truth . " <P> A standard criticism of Lear is that it is insufficiently motivated : Why do the malicious whims of two ungrateful daughters plunge the old man into a frenzy of madness and remorse ? Why does his single action - the banishment of Cordelia - cause his universe to crumble about him ? <P> The answer , as interpreted by actors such as Paul Scofield and the late Louis Calhern , is that the seeds of madness have always lain dormant in Lear , ready at the slightest pretext to sprout . But Carnovsky has a more mordant and , in many ways , a more tragic view . Lear , he contends , is everyman ; his disasters are everyman 's and the tragedy in Shakespeare 's eye " is not in Lear himself , but in life . " When Carnovsky 's Lear , reeling like a wounded animal , howls forth <P> When we are born , we cry that we are come To this great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and for Gloucester but for his audience as well . <P> Sense of Loss . Nothing that Lear has done or will do can account for the disasters that overtake him or for the death of Cordelia , which Carnovsky finds " so needless it is unbearable . " As Carnovsky interprets him , Lear is a man stripped of everything except the strength to protest . His final act , he points out , " is to accuse the gods , to say if you can do this , then life is not worth living . Lear then consents to die . " What gives Lear dignity at last is his unflinching involvement in his own destruction . Through him , Carnovsky thinks , Shakespeare was saying " I am part of life , and I affirm . " <P> Although Carnovsky is not a large man ( 5 ft. 9 in. , 165 Ibs. ) he dominates the stage at Stratford with such extraordinary passion that the rest of the cast seems physically small by comparison .
