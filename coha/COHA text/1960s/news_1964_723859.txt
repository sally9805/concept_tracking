txt NAIROBI  --  Africa 's problem is skin-deep and not just in the sense of pigmentation . The world is acutely familiar with the legacy of race prejudice left by colonialism and its counterpart , decolonization . Several African governments are now making sincere efforts to prove they can be fairer to the white man than he was to them by creating the rudiments of multiracial society . The trouble is that so far these are for the most part rudiments . They are not rudiments in the sense of multiracialism but in the sense of society itself . The colonial powers , combining neglect with deliberate policy , had ignored the common-sense duty of giving the Africans minimal intellectual and economic opportunities to integrate them Into the habits of equality . Now Africa  --  and maybe the world ? must pay for this . Fortunately there is in almost each new African state a handful of educated , far-sighted and frequently tolerant politicians who have inherited the task of nationbuilding . But this layer is only skindeep . If that thin skin can not contain the disorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africans and European observers are convinced that , at the very least for the first generation of its freedom , most of this continent must be governed by strong , centralized administration . This is virtually another way of saying that , if they can be found , be , nevolent despots are the answer . Such opinion does n't favor the kind of pompous and intolerant dictatorship exemplified by Nkrumah in Ghana . But it does favor , where possible , giving critical power to national heroes like Kenya 's Jomo Kenyatta and supporting them with one-party parliamentary rule rather than the give and take of Western democracy . Brand new nations built on poverty and illiteracy can not afford the luxury of ill-informed , delaying debate when urgent problems demand urgent solutions . The danger in this formula is that , even when it works , stability depends wholly upon the health of the hero-ruler . The lesson was driven home last week when Kenyatta was rumored to be ill . Immediately everyone began talking about disaster should the old man die . There are no habits of succession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Violence Many African governments are founded upon cabinet coalitions that stem from tribal support for respective ministers . If the ministers start quarreling for ascendancy , their political argument risks reflection in violence between their tribes . The idea of nationhood is embryonic , the idea of tribalism dates from primeval time . Some African leaders are genuinely , almost poetically , resolved to give the world a lesson in multiracial tolerance . They point out that they based their independence fight on ending discrimination ; that they can not denounce racism in South Africa or the U.S. South if they themselves apply it in reverse . But they also admit they are ahead of the masses on this and that the masses must be controlled while they are educated . For Mich purposes a kind of political hero-worship is useful . And they think a strong leader can best ? be backed up by a kind of voluntary one-party system . Kenya 's Tom Mboya , Minister of Justice , and J. S. Gichuru , Minister of Finance , endorse the above formula on grounds that " a breathing space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to come strong central administration will rely not only on the wisdom but the durability of the man about whom it is formed . The recent spasm of anxiety concerning the aged Kenyatta merely stressed the point . There are few African heroes both prominent and untarnished . Tanganyika 's Nyerere suffered loss of prestige by weak behavior during his army 's recent mutiny . And also , there are few second-level ministers of the Mboya-Gichuru caliber who realistically face this evolving continent 's problems and study economic reform and political method . Yet while they eye the future in terms of years , they can not be sure what tomorrow itself may bring . Africa 's cruel heritage of skinconsciousness is a heavy load added to Africa 's destitution and backwardness . But the most immediate problem is the skin-deep layer of administrative talent . If this is not given opportunity to thicken , Lord knows what may happen . It will take time and patience to shape the African dream ? if time exists . 1711 ? 11 ? ? ? ? =gl      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
