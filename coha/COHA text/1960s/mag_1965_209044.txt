His style of comedy would , on someone else , be labeled deadpan . But Jackie Vernon 's pan is not dead ; it is dying , painfully , by degrees . <P> For a long while the pain was real ; persistent obscurity , cancellations when his act bombed , endless bouncing from cellar to dive in search of a sympathetic audience . At last he found one . Its name was Steve Allen , who caught Vernon 's act in Canada and booked him for his TV show . After Allen came Jack Paar , Ed Sullivan , Hootenanny-and success . Last week Vernon fans gathered at Manhattan 's Hotel Plaza to pay homage to their anti-hero-the first stand-up comic to play the staid Persian Room in 41 years . <P> Vernon , now 36 , is the classic loser . His act , always in the same minor key , begins with an apology : " I 'm only doing this because I could n't get a job in my regular line of work . I 'm a Viking . " He lugubriously narrates his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighter . My grandmother was an old Yugoslavian guerrilla . My family was so underprivileged we used to get food from Europe . Finally I was adopted by a Korean family . " <P> Things got no better with age . Whatever he did offended somebody . On breadlines he asked for toast . When President Johnson declared war on poverty , he went out and threw a hand grenade at a beggar . To lose weight he started eating saccharin-and got artificial diabetes . He fell in love with a promiscuous girl , so promiscuous she became a hostess in an alley . <P> At last , perking up enough to look defeated , he recites his efforts to Strike Back : " I wrote Rx on windows of Christian Science Reading Rooms , sent calendars to lifers , scrawled the Star of David on Volkswagens . I carried placards , BAN THE BOMB , BRING BACK <P> MUSTARD GAS . " Nothing helped . At last , lonely and morose , he sought the companionship of a watermelon . " I figured if things did n't work out I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he was left alienated once again . Vernon 's miseries will be worth $100,000 this year . And future bookings are pouring in . Still , Vernon is taking no chances , planning no new routines . " I 've been a real loser too long , " he says . " I 'm sticking with failure . It 's been good to me. "
