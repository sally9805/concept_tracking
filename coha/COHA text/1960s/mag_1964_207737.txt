Last July 13 , Freeman Frazee doffed thefolded paper cap that identifies the newspaper pressman and walked off his job at the Detroit Free Press . Since Frazee is president of the Detroit printing pressmen 's union , he was followed by all his men , and at both the Free Press and the city 's other paper , the evening News , the presses ground to a stop-silenced by Detroit 's ninth newspaper strike since 1955 . By last week , as the strike entered its seventh week , all Detroit was beginning to wonder whether " Smoky " Frazee could ever be talked back into his pressman 's cap . <P> As in New York City , where Bert Powers of the International Typographical Union was able to silence Manhattan dailies for 114 days ( TIME cover , ' March 1 , 1963 ) , Detroit 's newspaper strike was a measure of the power of one stubborn man . Only one other union joined Frazee 's walkout : the paper and plate handlers ' union . The other twelve newspaper unions in Detroit , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back to work . <P> Frazee is sitting tight on his insistence that Free Press pressmen get time and a half for rolling the Sunday edition . To the publishers , the demand seems ; outrageous . No morning paper in the country pays that bonus , and the morning Free Press is loath to set a precedent . The union demand is loosely based ! on what is called a " double shift , " common enough on evening papers with Sunday editions , where pressmen must roll both the Saturday and the Sunday paper on the same day . <P> But Free Press pressmen have never had to work that double shift , and are handsomely compensated for overtime . On the day President Kennedy was assassinated and the paper called its press crew an hour early , the union demanded-and got-a full day 's pay for the additional hour 's work . In Detroit , the income of newspaper pressmen stands among the highest in organized labor : an average $11,400 a year . <P> Last week , in an effort to break the impasse , Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at the bargaining table . But Smoky was not in a negotiating mood . " Sure , it 's a breakthrough , " said he of his premium-pay demand . " But so were pensions a few years ago-when I got ' em here . " <P> <P> * A nickname Frazee earned by getting born in Pittsburgh .
