As rocket and mortar fire continued to pound up and down South Viet Nam and the Communists ' post-Tet offensive of 1969 ended its third week , it bore some superficial resemblances to its predecessor at Tet last year . There was scarcely a major city or military center in the country that had not suffered some enemy fire . The numbers of provincial capitals that came under attack this year and last were identical : 29 . " If you plotted the action by throwing up darts at a board , " said one U.S. officer , " they 'd look about the same . " Outwardly the most distressing comparison turned up in U.S. casualty figures : in the first two weeks of the offensive , the number of American dead reached 783 , just 33 men short of last year 's two-week total . <P> Yet in the strategy of the Communist fighting , the two offensives so far have proved very different in means , targets and goals . The 1968 push was a total , countrywide assault , a general offensive involving nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nguyen Giap could muster . By contrast , most of the darts on this year 's board were the result not of ground attack but of " indirect fire " - shooting and shelling from safely remote points . Almost nowhere did Hanoi commit troops in more than company strength . Moreover , the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong concentrated attacks on military rather than civilian targets , bypassing all but 138 , or only 1% , of South Viet Nam 's 12,900 hamlets . <P> Heavy Blow . By thus avoiding contact wherever possible , Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops have been able to cut their own losses by nearly two-thirds of last year 's fearful toll : so far , their dead have numbered about 11,000 ( v. nearly 30,000 after two weeks of fighting during the last offensive ) . Though still a heavy penalty , U.S. officials believe that Hanoi considers it within range of " acceptable " losses . <P> South Viet Nam 's civilians have fared far better this year . Despite the occasional shelling of cities , the ordinary life in the country continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the vital pacification effort-dealt a heavy blow in last year 's assault-is unaffected in 36 of the country 's 44 provinces . Saigon , which became an urban battlefield in 1968 , has so far felt the offensive 's blows only in the form of rocket salvos . There are no new curfew restrictions , no hoarding , no staggering price increases . Acts of terrorism , while still a threat , are well below last year 's level , and the number of civilians made refugees in the current offensive is 23,877 , less than 5% of the total last year .
