O come all ye faithful : that jolly old fat man with the Fiberglas whiskers is here again . This year his bag is fairly bulging with forged passports , coshed corpses , ballistic cigarettes , transistorized brooches , nitroglycerin earrings , infra-red herrings-all the preposterous technology of terror developed by a movie industry that seems to have eyes only for spies . Three new epics of espionage deck the halls with buckets of blood and hang enough promiscuous mistletoe to give the customers a blue Christmas . <P> Funeral in Berlin is the sequel though not the equal of The Ipcress File . Where Ip was engagingly shaggy , FIB is insistently slick . But then slick is not a bad thing for a thriller to be . <P> In the first film , British Agent Harry Palmer ( Michael Caine ) was a smalltime crook who took up spying to keep out of jail and eluded his perils as witlessly as spaghetti eludes a fork . In the second , he is a complete professional assigned to prevent his apparat from falling into a Russian trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheese , a Russian intelligence colonel ( Oscar Homolka ) who makes a rather dubious offer to defect to the West . Agent Palmer warily makes arrangements for the colonel to enter West Berlin in a coffin . When the coffin is opened , however , Palmer gets the first of several nasty surprises . The nastiest : a luscious Israeli agent ( Eva Renzi ) who invites Palmer to have conversation on what turns out to be a mattress of life and death . <P> The plot gets so thick at some points that the script does n't bother to explain what has happened and why . But at all times the action is shifty , the dialogue pert , the backdrop laid on in a colorful cinemontage of both Berlins . What 's more , the film is refreshingly free of Machiavellian machinery-the most sophisticated gizmo these spies employ is a telephone . And as the hero , Caine is able . <P> The Quiller Memorandum , a movie version of Adam Hall 's thriller about neo-Nazism in contemporary Germany , also takes place in Berlin-in modern movies a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The neos are investigated by a feller named Quiller ( George Segal ) , a British agent who speaks , as moviegoers may observe with some astonishment , in a fearless Brooklyn snarl . When he arrives in Berlin , Agent Quiller is met by his control ( Alec Guinness ) , a twitchy old party who informs him in a ghost-story voice that the fascist underground is far more powerful in Germany than people think . <P> Quiller is assigned to capture the fascist high command , but with the help of the inevitable under-covers operative ( Senta Berger ) the high command captures him first . Scratched by a needle concealed in a suitcase , Quiller wakes up in a bomb-shattered mansion to find himself staring at an actor of proven ability ( Max von Sydow ) who suddenly comes on like the blond beast in a B movie .
