Things were purring along on the good ship Pussycat as it headed south out of San Francisco down the coast to San Diego . Aboard the 65-ft. yacht was Comedian Jerry Lewis , making his first real cruise on his spanking new toy . There was crystal in the galley , mahogany paneling everywhere , and a pair of deck chairs were tastefully stenciled " Mr. Captain " and " Mrs. Captain . " Suddenly the tub sprang a leak , and pretty soon Pussycat was drifting helplessly . At last , when the table floated across the dining room , Mr. Captain and crew abandoned ship and made it to the beach , where they watched $350,000 worth of status break up in the surf . <P> Because of the light-the shattering clarity that had seduced so many artists-Painter Marc Chagall in 1950 left Paris to live on the Riviera . Last week Chagall , now 79 , said merci to the land of azure waters with a $2,000,000 gift : 17 major oils and 50 gouaches and watercolors , representing much of his last twelve years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chagall museum in Nice . When it is completed in 1968 , the memorial will take its place beside the Riviera 's three other museums dedicated to modern masters : Picasso 's in Antibes , Lger 's in Biot and Matisse 's , also in Nice . <P> " They do n't care anything about Latin girls , " cried Miss Ecuador before the judging .

Sure enough , Miss Sweden , Margareta Arvidsson , 18 , was crowned Miss Universe in Miami . No pleasing some people-she wept too . " I do n't want it , " she groaned . " Now I wo n't be able to go anywhere without a chaperone . " By next morning the sea captain 's daughter had recovered . Said she : " I do n't remember anything about last night . " <P> Not much escaped the memento seekers when Manhattan 's old Metropolitan Opera House closed down last April . Opera buffs pried off seat numbers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , RCA Victor carted away ( after paying $10,000 ) the gold brocade curtain and announced that it would cut the drapery into 45,000 patches and include one in each copy of a souvenir-record album called Opening Nights at the Metropolitan . Of course , the curtain did shrink some in the cleaning , but there was enough to go around as Soprano Leontyne Price scissored off the first snippet for publicity 's sake . Then she hurried back to rehearsals at the new Met , where she will star opening night as Cleopatra in an opera written for her by Composer Samuel Barber .
