Notes and Comment IN the absence of other New York newspapers , we have been reading the Wall Strew Journal more faithfully than usual , and learning quite a bit about economics . We are consequently becoming more conservative and apprehensive five days a week , and have only Saturday and Sunday , when the Journal does not appear , left in which to &frighten; ourself . Just the other day , for example , the Journal warned the readers of its editorial page of what , it conceded , has been a hitherto unnoticed " especially adverse effect of the corporation profits tax as a drag against more efficient economic activity . " Under the present fiscal scheme , the corporations that make the most money  --  and therefore , in Journal language , are the most " efficient " ? pay the highest taxes . " The marginal producer pays less ; nothing if he is sufficiently inefficient as to make no profits , " the editorialist pointed nut . This astonished us ; we had always opposed the creation of a privileged fiscal class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The effect of this ... is to slowly shift the control of more of the nation 's resources into the hands of the less efficient producers and managers . " ( A trivial question , undoubtedly frivolous , momentarily crossed our mind : What would a man with no income eat while the control of the nation 's resources slowly shifted in his direction ? Long acquaintance with the Journal 's thought processes enabled us to formulate the answer without posting a query to the editor : He would disguise himself as a native of an undeveloped country and live on surplus powdered milk wastefully distributed by the Agency for International Development . ) What the Journal was advocating , in the interim before the income tax could be " replaced by some sort of expenditure tax , " was relief for the big income . " Income taxes discourage savings because they treat consumption and savings equally  --  that is , your tax is the same whether you spend the money in riotous living or whether you save and make a contribution to the future economic growth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly progressive rates especially restrict the amount of savings by falling most heavily on those incomes from which come the greatest savings . " Since earners of low incomes indubitably spend a higher proportion of what they get than earners of high incomes  --  their pitifully irrelevant excuses for this can he ignored  --  the obvious remedy is a graduated income tax made progressive downward , or upside-downward , from no tax on incomes of a hundred thousand dollars and up ( which furnish the most funds for investment ) to a hundred per cent on incomes of a thousand dollars and down ( which are probably wasted on riotous living , since those earning them own few corporate shares ) . This would not eliminate the favored position of the man who makes no money at all , since even if he were taxed a hundred per cent he would still pay nothing , but it would at least temper the injustice to his most efficient competitors , since they would pay nothing also . Van Vechten WE 'VE just had a good conversational ramble with Carl Van Vechten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of the genera-don or two with whom Van Vechten 's name may not immediately ring a bell , let it he known that he came here from the Midwest in 1906 , when he was twenty-six ; that by the end of the First World War he had become perhaps the foremost music critic in town ; and that during the nineteen-twenties , having retired as a critic , he enjoyed a considerable vogue as a novelist-chronicler of  --  not to say a notable participant in  --  the unbuttoned bohemian life of the city . Once the party was patently ovtr ( and the last of his seven novels , which was published in 1930 , was significantly entitled " Parties " ) , he turned a longtime hobby of his , portrait photography , irdo a third career , and again achieved distinction . No sooner had Van Vechten arrived in New York than he found himself living in a rooming house also occupied by another young newcomer from the Midwest , Sinclair Lewis , and in time he became a prominent member of the wide circle that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edna St. Vincent Millay , and Mabel Dodge Luhan . As a pre-Beat advocate of social mixing of the races , he introduced many a white sophisticate to Harlem and its night life , and helped establish literary beachheads downtown for Negro writers , James Weldon Johnson and Langston Hughes among them . And he estimates that since taking up portrait photography , which he still keenly pursuesMahalia Jackson was one of his most recent subjects  --  more than ten t iousand people have sat for him . " I 've photographed everybody , from Matisse to Isamu Noguchi , " Mr. Van Vechten told us when we went up to Central Park Vest the other afternoon to see him at his apartment-studio , which is something of a reminder of the twenties itself , with Covarrubias paintings and similar period art much in evidence . " My first subject was Anna May Wong , and my second was Eugene O'Neill . " Always an arresting figure , as we could see from a large , early oil porwhich saw him married and divorced , and then married to the actress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Van Vechten continued to make it clear that he has always had one whale of a time living in New York . If Harlem night-clubbing and the abandon of prohibition-era houseparties are things of his past , he still has Negro Friends , whom he visits uptown , and who are frequent guests in his own home . ( " I still get about twenty-five letters a day from Negroes , " he remarked with satisfaction . ) And he is an active devotee not only of concerts and opera but also of foreign films . Prominently hung in his foyer is a large poster that was once used to advertise the movie " Calque d'Or " and that features a drawing of Simone Signoret , who is a friend and photographic subject of his . " I 'm mad for her , " said Van Vechten . " And have you caught that new French picture , ' Sundays and Cybele ' ? I think it may be the best I 've ever seen . As for Off Broadway shows , I do n't get to see as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such strange places that it 's hard to make one 's way back home . I admire and respect Edward Albee and his kind of play . Oh , there are things I do n't like about the city , too . Of course , the traffic is unbearable nowadays , but then it 's that way everywhere . I 'm wildly against childbirth , you know . If something is n't done about it , people will he starving in the streets , as they do in China . Two young college professors came up to see me the other day , and when I learned that one of them had three children and the other four , I gave them bloody hell . Since I have no children myself , it 's both more and less possible for me to say such things . " We asked Van Vechten if he would show us some of the portraits he 'd taken , and he led us into his studio . Our eye immediately fell on splendid pictures of , among others , Franz Werfel , Diahann Carroll , Kim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last in a rare , happily smiling pose . We complimented Van Vechten , and he explained that he still develops his own photographs . " I 'm very fussy about the printing , " he said . " I throw out anything that is n't perfection . Pm usually up at six in the morning and , as I did today , spend five or six hours in the darkroom . I do n't think I 've ever lost interest in anything . " ? INCIDENTAL INTELLIGENCE : There 's a Christian Termite Control outfit in Watson , Missouri . Tiny Trees WE 'VE been over to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden to attend a daylong session of instruction in the Japanese art of bonsai . The word " bonsai , " pronounced " bonesigh , " is applied not only to the art itself but to the product of the artist , since it means " tray arrangement " a fact we lifted from a bonsai handbook that the Botanic Garden publishes and that contains enough information on this obscure art to permit one to dine out all winter on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the art of bonsai is to create , through dwarfing and shaping , a miniature of a venerable tree on a horizon , with the perfection of line of a work of art ; that the creation of a fine bonsai can be a lifework ; that many living bonsai are well over a century old ; and that bonsai are as precious as jewels , a first-rate one bringing as much as seven thousand dollars . ( This last truth was all too vividly demonstrated last October , when some horticultural-minded miscreant made off with one of the finest specimens in the Brooklyn bonsai collection  --  a Japanese white pine two and a half feet tall , which the Garden authorities valued at two thousand dollars , and which has yet to be recovered . ) The first authentic reference to bonsai occurs in a scroll dating back to 1310 . In the course of time , various sub-specialties have developed inside the specialty , among them mame ( pronounced ? malunee " ) , in which trees are no more than a few inches high and can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admired ; netsuranari currently very fashionable in Japan in which several trees adroitly hunched together give the appearance of a tiny forest ; and ishitsuki , in which a stone shares honors with the trees growing about it . Smallleaved Japanese pines and Japanese cedars are especially fancied in bonsai circles , because of their air of great age and the consequent implication that life is able to triumph over hostile elements . Dwarfed trees , mostly conifers , are to he found growing naturally in the poor , dry soil of Japan 's mountain regions , but bonsai collectors have pretty well stripped all but the highest , most inaccessible peaks , and the usual course fora bonsai beginner is to go to a nursery and buy an already semi-dwarfed tree or an ordinary young tree amenable to a lifetime of pruning , wiring , and other rigorous treatment . In Japan , bonsai are raised outdoors , and we suspect that no truly dedicated bonsai lover could he bothered with non-hardy bonsai used as house plants . The Brooklyn bonsai people , though , are a broadminded lot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the auditorium , where a group of some thirty women and half a dozen men were listening enraptured to a lecture by Miss Alys Sutcliffe on that very subject . Miss Sutcliffe plucked a plant from its pot and said , " This is rosemary , a woody shrub best known as an herb , but it is a very good bonsai for the house . " She held up a shallow pottery dish about the size of an ashtray and went on , " Your bonsai container should he something on this order  --  never more than a third of the height of the bonsai itself . Start with some very coarse sand for drainage , settle the plant in the sand , then add soil little by little , poking it in with chopsticks . " Chopsticks ! We felt ourself becoming a bonsai booster then and there . After Miss Sutcliffe had finished , the group proceeded to a greenhouse , for guidance in potting from Frank Okamura , whom Dr. George S. Avery , director of the Garden , introduced as a veritable synonym of bonsai . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dishes , and Mr. Okamura darted from one student to another , encouraging and correcting . A lady feared that she might have given her azalea too great a slant . " No , no , fine ! " said Mr. Okamura . " You have wisely chosen cascade style . " One of the men set his plant in the very middle of the dish , and Mr. Okamura mildly chastised him . " Never plant in center for good result in art , " he said . " In center is where Nature God come down , so always leave center empty for him . " Everyone having dished a plant , we visited a display of bonsai in the lobby of the main Garden building . Dr. Avery identified and analyzed for us bonsai made from an azalea ( " probably fifty years old " ) , a cypress , a rhododendron , a sugar maple , a pin oak , a golden larch , a crab apple , and a dwarf Japanese oak , marvellously gnarled and going undatedly far hack into the nineteenth century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only for periods of silent appreciation , " he said . " They must he strong as well as beautiful . " He then led the way to lunch , in the cafeteria of the Brooklyn Museum , where one of our tahlcmates was a member of the Garden staff , who told us that some two thousand students have taken the bonsai course over the past ten years , that most of the students are amateurs , and that , among the men , the majority are , rather mysteriously , doctors or lawyers . After lunch , we went hack to the auditorium for a class in pruning and wiring , given by Mr. Okainura. stepped to a blackboard and drew a three-branched tree . " Three most important things in life  --  Heaven , Earth , Man , " he said . " That is master plan of bonsai . " Next , he picked up a small , bushy azalea and , with swift snips of a pair of scissors , reduced it to a three-branched master plan . " Not yet bonsai , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Goodness , and Beauty . " A large order , but with perfect confidence he took a length of fine copper wire and began to wrap it around the stein and branches of the plant . After a couple of minutes of strenuous twisting and wiring , Mr. Okamura held up the azalea . To our astonishment , the plant had become beautiful  --  and , for all we can say to the contrary , true and good . " A beginning , " said Mr. Okamura . " You work on this for five or ten years and you find you have pretty nice bonsai .

" Antiques Show THE annual Winter Antiques Show is coming up at the Seventh Regiment Armory this month , so we arranged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Grace G. Lindquist . She and her husband , Carl R. , are co-directors of East Side House , a seventy-two-year-old social settlement  --  formerly on the East River , in the Seventies , and now in the Bronx  --  that earns about a quarter of the funds required by an annual **37;2459;TOOLONG budget through putting on the Armory exhibit . Her experience may benefit persons interested in benefits . " Eleven or twelve years ago , after we 'd tried circus parties , theatre parties , balls , and dinners , without too much success , I thought , Why not try to find some kind of benefit where the pressures are n't so great ? " she told us . " Theatre parties are mad , you know . Every money-raising institution wants to get the best shows . Well , we prevailed on the Madison Square Garden Antiques Show to let us have a booth in the basement , and our committeewomen ransacked their attics for Aunt Emily 's coffeepots , glass , furniture , and so on , and then came in and sold them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very pleased . We took another booth the next year , but this time our cupboards were relatively bare , and we made only half what we 'd made before . As a matter of fact , our ladies probably bought as much  --  from the dealers at the show  --  as they sold . One of these dealers , a nice young man in the booth next to ours , called my attention to the Illinois Children 's Aid Society , in Chicago , which put on an annual benefit antiques show , involving some thirty dealers , at an old McCormick house there . You could do something like that , ' he said . Well , after getting our board 's permission to investigate this , I went to Chicago and talked with the Illinois committee chairman . Do n't get a house , ' she said . ' It 's too expensive to light , and after a couple of years people 's curiosity about it subsides . ' We hired the Seventh Regiment Armory in 1955 and cleared over twelve thousand dollars ; last year we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealers took a chance on us ; we had a hundred and eleven of them the first year . This year , we have a hundred and two , but we 've increased the individual exhibitor 's space quite a bit . We sell the dealers space and we supply the electrical outlets ; a regular exposition firm comes in and sets the thing up for us . We get nothing from sales . We get the door admissions ( two dollars ) and the profits from the catalogue , which contains advertising and sells for a dollar ( we print seven thousand , and they sell out ) , and we have an opening-night cocktail-buffet benefit preview , at twenty dollars a ticket , which includes a duration pass to the show . This is always a very nice party . " Mrs. Lindquist , a comfortable-looking Vermonter with a brisk and benevolent air , went on to tell us that three kinds of people show up for the preview . " There 's the man , or woman , who comes for a good party and to help the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the real collector , " she said . " The real collector is right at the door when it opens . He never looks at the cocktails . He marches straight into the drill shed and buys . The real collectors come from all over the country . There 's always a contingent from Philadelphia , and one group flies in from Texas every year in a chartered plane . There 's a lot of buying on the opening night , and there 's a lot of business between the dealers themselves before the opening night . The minute an exhibitor begins to unpack , the others begin to look at his things . I suppose the finest antiques show in the world is the Grosvenor Show , in London , which is held in the spring , and I should n't wonder if we were the runner-up .

" Symposium EKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him to the symposium , we were taken along to the Statler Hilton the other afternoon by a philosopher friend  --  to a four-thirty tea that was one of a series of meetings of the American Philosophical Association . Our friend took his wife along , too , and just before we reached the Gold Ballroom , where tea was to he served , he fell behind , like Socrates  --  not to become absorbed in philosophical speculation but to talk to his wife about where they were going to have dinner . Though it was five minutes after the tea was scheduled to begin , the Gold Ballroom was empty of both tea and guests , and we were just beginning to have second thoughts about being there when several waiters appeared with a few tables and the refreshments , and a horde of philosophers entered . " Are you a philosopher one of the philosophers asked us . " No , " we replied , joining the line for tea . " We , a poor creature , have come uninvited to a wise man 's feast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " because there 's no such thing as looking like a philosopher ; it 's a matter of acting like one . The majority of the people here arc aspiring , not full-fledged , philosophers . They are graduate students looking for jobs . " At that moment , a number of harassed-looking young men rushed up to him to introduce themselves . We glanced around the ballroom and finally spotted the man we had come with ; he was standing directly behind us in the line , which was n't moving , because it was n't the line at all but merely a single file of people who were too absorbed in conversation to keep track of where they were going . " A curious thing just happened , " our friend said . " I mentioned to someone that my wife and I were going to see The Blacks ' tonight  --  you know , the Gent play  --  but he thought I was referring to the Blacks ; that is , to MiL Black , the philosopher , and his wife . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that no one who believes in determinism ever deliberates  --  he suggested that in a paper he read this afternoon  --  but I never got around to it . " Thrusting himself into the right lint and pulling us with him , he said , " There 's the Great Emotivist . Not the one with the pointed head  --  the one next to him . " When we had gut our tea , our friend conducted us to a corner table , where his wife was waiting for us . He stole two chairs from a group of job-seekers from Brown , and we sat down . " Now , over there , " he said , with a wave toward the center of the room , " is the Great Encyclopedist , surrounded by his girl assistants . He 's editing an encyclopedia of . philosophy , and I 'm doing the Mind-Body Problem for him . Someone here today referred to the Body-Mind Problem ; I wonder if they 're the same thing . Anyway , they 're always discussing the encyclopedia over dinner , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A philosopher came over to tell our friend of his relief at not having either to look for a job or to find a man to fill one . Then , turning to us , he asked if we were enjoying ourself , and when we told him we were , he said he himself found the meetings so boring that they were interesting . " There is nothing at all interesting about mud , " he said , " hut when you have a pile of mud as big as the Empire State Building .. . " With that , lie left us in the company of a philosopher who had sat down to discuss with our friend the size of the honorarium for a talk he was to give at Swarthmore . He went on to ponder possible topics for the talk . " Something like Why Not Pleasure ? ' " he said " Or Virtue in Plato 's Republic .

At five-fifty-five , the waiters began to strip and dismantle the tables , sending the philosophers scattering to the four corners of the Sutler ?
