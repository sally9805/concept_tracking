txt WASHINGTON , Feb. ** Johnson is nettled because of the criticism throughout the country of the use he has made of the leeway Congress gave him in the statute which requires that economic and military aid be suspended to recipient nations which trade with Communist Cuba . The President , said Congress , could refrain from taking this step when ' he ' deemed that the exemption was required by " the national interest . " This criticism has taken two forms : ( 1 ) the cutoffs he ordered here of sums so trivial that the act could only be interpreted as a political gesture in a Presidential year ; and ( 2 ) the cutoffs exposed to ridicule a Government which at the same time is actively engaged in promoting trade with the U. S. S. R. , Castro 's principal source of arms , financing and education in the arts of sabotage and subversion that Cuba is steadily employing in the Western Hemisphere . The President 's defenders retorted that the critics are deliberately or ignorantly missing the main point in concentrating on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The main point , according to these counter critics , is that the President 's acts were in the nature of a warning , " a first step " in a major policy which will require that the maritime nations of the free world either cooperate with our trade boycott of Cuba , or prepare to assume a much heavier load of the burdens of the military alliances against global communism in which these nations share membership with the United States . The difficulties of executing this threat are as numerous as they are apparent . First , despite the special attitude that the objective of the United States as the chief architect of these alliances is primarily to deter world Communism from expanding ! into Europe , Asia , Africa and I Lett ' America , the fact is that ! they are the periphery of the ! defense of the United States as ' drawn by every post-war Ad- ; ministration . Second , the rare ' periods in which a common economic policy can be imposed on an alliance is when this policy ? serves the national interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the partners of the United States in the world-wide network of this nation 's alliances agree with this Government 's diplomatic and military policy in the Far East . Weakness in Policy Except for a few weak neighbors of South Vietnam , no United States ally believes that the neutralization of this country would leave it more open , to domination by Communist China than it already is by reason of the lack of enthusiasm among its people for their own defense . And no important United States ally believes that the way to subdue the militancy of Communist China is the way of diplomatic non-recognition and trade boycott the United ' States has taken . Moreover , by substituting for the Monroe Doctrine a firm non-intervention pledge to the other members of the Organization of American States , the Government assumed an obligation which allowed the U.S.S.R. to establish a satellite state , Cuba , in the Western Hemisphere . But the official permission granted to American exporters to sell surplus wheat to the Soviet Union has also developed a fundamental weakness in the Administration 's effort to , induce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an economic boycott of Cuba . The terms of the grant , as first announced by President Kennedy , have been steadily eased , so that these maritime nations have substance for their charge that the wheat deal is inconsistent with the official objections to their trade with Castro . If , they inquire , the United States can sell wheat to Russia that can be trans-shipped by East European satellites to Cuba in exchange for sugar , and foreign ships in two-way commerce with both the United States and Cuba can even refuel in American ports of call , why should not allied and neutral nations directly sell and deliver buses and other commercial goods to Cuba ? Official Answer The official answer to this embarrassing question is that food is a " non-strategic " commodity , but buses are not ; that you can only " eat " wheat , but buses and airplanes provide Castro with a transport system , indispensable to the buildup of the Cuban economy and military establishment , Another inconsistency is the official theory of the United States Government that a " fat Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to yearn for the paths of peace than a hungry one . But the modification of the terms of the wheat deal as stated by President Kennedy to , his news conference of Oct. 9,1 1963 , has also obstructed the ' Government 's efforts to stop allied and neutral trading with Cuba . No longer can the wheat transaction be argued as an operation of private American business as distinguished from ! the commerce with Cuba via ships which fly the flags of the maritime of the free world . " It is not a Government-to-Government transaction , " said Mr. Kennedy . " ... These are private traders ... and the credit will be granted by banks . . . " The payments , he said , would be in " American dollars or gold , either cash on delivery or normal commercial credit . " And " the wheat will be carried in available American ships , supplemented by ships of other countries as required . " Transition Changes A month later , following protests from shippers , shipping unions and members of Congress , the specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriers must be American , a requirement lately officially reduced to 38 per cent , which is one of the causes of the refusal of longshoremen to load wheat cargoes . And the promised " private transaction " with private bank credits was shortly transformed into a " Government-to-Government " affair when the official Export-Import Bank guaranteed private loans to finance U.S.S.R. purchases from the wheat exporters . Perhaps the most embarrassing incident in the chapter was the implied invitation to the American people by Secre-1 tary of State Rusk to abstain , from buying the goods on sale ' here from the free world countries which trade with Cuba . This was so ludicrously inconsistent with the Government 's complaint that units of the public , such as the longshoremen 's union , are trying " to make foreign policy " that the State Department was compelled to make a formal announcement it did not " favor " the consumers ' boycott its own chief had both covertly and openly encouraged .                   @ @
