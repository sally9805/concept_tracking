Next to trying to figure out whether Kennedy or Nixon will win in November , Washington 's most intriguing political preoccupation is trying to guess who would people the winning Cabinet . Neither candidate is about to confide his list yet , even if he had one waiting in his inside coat-pocket . Nor is he about to make premature promises , when uncertainty makes all potential Cabinet members campaign hard for the candidate . Sideline guessers can claim no inside dope . But here are some of their choices . <P> NIXON <P> Most agree that Richard Nixon would pick some of his Cabinet members from the present Eisenhower Cabinet . His known favorites : Attorney General William P. Rogers , Nixon 's closest friend and ally in the Government ; Interior Secretary Fred Seaton and Labor Secretary James P. Mitchell , who have sided with Nixon in intra-Administration policy disagreements ; and Treasury Secretary Robert B. Anderson . Nixon also has high regard for Under Secretary of State C. Douglas Dillon and Under Secretary of the Treasury Fred Scribner Jr . <P> Mentioned most often by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York 's Governor Nelson Rockefeller or ex-Governor Thomas E. Dewey ; G.O.P. Keynoter Walter Judd of Minnesota . <P> TREASURY : Anderson or Scribner . <P> DEFENSE : Anderson , Rockefeller , or Michigan 's Congressman Gerald Ford Jr . <P> ATTORNEY GENERAL : Rogers or Pennsylvania 's Congressman Hugh Scott , onetime G.O.P. national chairman . <P> POSTMASTER GENERAL : Leonard W. Hall , another former national chairman and a top Nixon political adviser . <P> INTERIOR : Oregon 's Mark Hat field or West Virginia 's Cecil Underwood , both youthful G.O.P. Governors . <P> AGRICULTURE : Seaton . <P> <P> COMMERCE : Kentucky 's Senator Thruston Morton , G.O.P. national chairman . <P> LABOR : Mitchell . <P> <P> HEALTH , EDUCATION AND WELFARE : Businessman Charles H. Percy , chairman of the convention 's Platform Committee . <P> KENNEDY <P> The word from Hyannisport is that John F. Kennedy would reach far afield for Cabinet choices , and any attempt to predict his Cabinet is futile . This did not stop these guesses : <P> STATE : Congressman Chester Bowles of Connecticut , who added to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run for re-election to Congress but would campaign for Kennedy instead ; Arkansas ' Senator William Fulbright , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee ; or one of two former U.S. Ambassadors to Russia-Aver ell Harriman or George Kennan . Adlai Stevenson is now being mentioned more often as Ambassador to the U.N. , although his old friend Eleanor Roosevelt , who still wants him to be Secretary of State , last week said that " his qualifications are not those needed at the moment in the U.N . " <P> <P> TREASURY : Nobody has any real ideas . <P> DEFENSE : Missouri 's Stuart Symington or Washington 's Henry M. ( " Scoop " ) Jackson , both Senate defense specialists . <P> ATTORNEY GENERAL : Connecticut 's Governor Abraham Ribicoff , Kennedy campaign strategist ; or Denver Attorney Byron ( " Whizzer " ) White , national chairman of Citizens for Kennedy . <P> POSTMASTER GENERAL : Connecticut 's Democratic state chairman , John Bailey .
