Samuel Gompers , a founder of the A.F.L. , once capsuled his philosophy in a single word : " More . " That same four-letter word , it now appears , would best describe the spending principles of the Kennedy Administration . <P> Last week President Kennedy unwrapped his budget for fiscal 1964 ( beginning next July ) , and lo , it called for more spending than ever . It had more of almost everything than the current budget-including red ink . Total expenditures : $98.8 billion , up some $4.5 billion from the current fiscal year , and $500 million more than the Government paid out in the peak spending year of World War II . Indicated deficit : $11.9 billion . Only a fraction of that deficit is attributable to the tax cuts that the President called for in his State of the Union message delivered earlier last week . Assuming that tax reduction would stimulate the economy , the Administration calculates the " net revenue loss " during fiscal 1964 at $2.7 billion . Thus , without any tax revision whatever , the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outgo and income . <P> Straight from Dreamland . To hear New Frontiersmen tell it , the new budget is lean and hard , a direct result of heroic economizing . President Kennedy labeled it " frugal , " said it represented the " minimum necessary to meet the essential needs . " Defense Secretary Robert McNamara-it was said-had slashed $13 billion from the Army , Navy and Air Force requests ; the Budget Bureau and the White House had lopped still another $8 billion or so out of the civilian agencies ' budgets . <P> But despite all this proclaimed austerity , the new budget brought out cries of horror in Congress . Senate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen called it " incredible , " and fellow Republicans in the Senate and House denounced it as " radical , " " ridiculous , " " morally wrong , " and " straight from a dreamland of fiscal fantasy . " Missouri 's Democratic Representative Clarence Cannon , chairman of the House Appropriations Committee , said the budget was " monstrous , " predicted that his committee would " find places to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fulbright said the budget " seems extraordinarily high . " And New Mexico 's Democratic Senator Clinton Anderson pronounced the budget " discouraging . " <P> " A Chilling Effect . " As if the stated figures were not bad enough , most Congressmen recognized that Presidents are traditionally and notoriously overoptimistic in estimating the size of budget deficits . Missouri 's Cannon complained on the floor of the House that over the past nine years the Administration budgetmakers have underestimated the red ink by a net total of $37.5 billion . " They were feasting on the delights of sweet anticipation , " growled Cannon . " But now we are gnawing on the cold corncob of stern reality . " For example , only a year ago Kennedy submitted a 1963 budget indicating a surplus of $500 million ; that wishful bit of black ink has since changed into a massive blotch of red , currently estimated at $8.8 billion . With that in mind , Virginia Democrat Harry F. Byrd , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , predicted that the actual deficit under the President 's 1964 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
