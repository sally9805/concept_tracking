 | Muhammad All , ne Cassius Clay , who is the heavyweight champion of the world to everyone but a few misguided officials of the World Boxing Association and Madison Square Garden , spends his time these days laboriously preparing lectures or exuberantly giving them . He lives in a small house in what was a middle-class white section of Chicago but is now rapidly becoming a middle-class Negro section . On a cold , wet afternoon a fortnight ago he sat at the dining room table in the house he bought from Herbert Muhammad , his manager . He was wearing a dark blue undershirt , blue jeans and white sweat socks , and before him on the table were a Bible , a Koran and a book by Elijah Muhammad : Message to the Black Man in America . On the floor was a tape recorder loaded with a tape of a speech Elijah had made in Chicago to his Black Muslim followers some time before . Ali has nearly a hundred of these tapes , which he plays over and over , making notes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long yellow legal pad to three-by-five cards , in preparation for a lecture , and now he stopped and stretched hugely . The muscles in his arms and shoulders are immense ; the mature All is a big man , bigger than Sonny Liston ever was . " I been up since 5:30 , " he said . " Been working on this lecture I got to give at UCLA . This one runs 54 cards and I can hold an audience spellbound for a hour and a half with it . " He riffled through the cards admiringly , stopping now and again to read a phrase . " I got six lectures I can give now , " he said . " Took me 2 ? months ' hard work to get them ready . Sometimes I get up at 5:30 in the morning , work straight through to 3:30 the next morning and get mad cause I ca n't keep eyes open to study more . I did n't st .. too good in high school and now ; ashamed and I 'm making up for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it t. ; in the dictionary . " He regarded the top card of the and began reading from it . At first he read in a quick monotone , but quick : the charm of his own prose and his extraordinary sense of the dramatic took hold and in a few moments he was delivering what amounted to a sermon He has the same flair as a speaker that he had as a fighter . " Take Lazarus , " he said , staring hypnotically across the room as if he were addressing a multitude . " He was charmed by the wealth of the rich man . He did n't get any of it but he loved to be around it , loved to see it and feel it and smell it . Even when he was offered a home in paradise , he could n't bear to 26 27 leave all that wealth behind him . And Lazarus was hated and despised by the rich men . " He broke off suddenly and grinned . " I got to get this down like I did boxing " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed and the stamina . I have n't got this lecture memorized yet , but I will by the time I have to give it . " He leafed through the Bible on the table stopping occasionally to read a sentence or two . " I 'm going through the Bible looking for parables and comparing it with the Koran . " he said . " Then I read Elijah Muhammad 's book and I take what I understand out of that and that 's how I get the subjects for my lectures . Like I find a parable about the wolf and the sheep trying to integrate together and I find other things to go with that , maybe out of some of these tapes of Elijah's.The time has come now for the black to help the black man . The Negro needs a program of self-development and I 'm developing myself now . " He paused to reflect upon this . " Integration , " he said . " It 's like that wolf and sheep trying to integrate together . God did n't mean it that way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and meant them to be seperate . Like I saw a little red ant wanng around on the ground . Maybe was lost or maybe he was looking something to eat . Anyway , he walked a nest of black ants , and the next thing you know they carried him out of r nest dead . Red ants stay with red ts , black with black . Sharks stay together , dolphins stay together . You do n't roe them trying to integrate . You say ' maybe in another 5,000 years or so all the races going to be the same , but it ai n't so . You say we 'll all be the same or , maybe the color of that dog 's ear over there . " He pointed to a small stuffed dog with long honey-colored ears . " I do n't want to be that color , " he said vehemently . " And I do n't want my children to be that color . A man naturalwants his children to look just like him . I do n't want no child with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want no black child . You want your child to look like you . " He turned toward the door to the kitchen and called out : " Belinda ! Come here , wife , I want you to meet someone . " Belinda came into the dining room probably $45,000 helping my mother and father . Bought them a house and I gave my mother a Cadillac , too . My brother , he 's trying to get a little house . I 've spent $25,000 on him . I paid Covington Hayden Covington , the attorney who represented him in his case with the draft board $68,000 and he say I owe him another $200,000 . Other lawyers , $50,000 . My home cost about $26 , - 000 and I spent another $35,000 getting it all fixed up , say a total of $75,000 . Cars , $45,000 . Then my own personal use , maybe $30,000 , not much because you never saw me drink or smoke or party . After a fight it was just me and a few friends sitting around and talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " All that comes to $463,000 . Now , in all my years of fighting , my share of the purses came to $2,300,000 , and the government took about 90 c of that in taxes . All my taxes are paid up . But you can see that do n't leave me much . " If the government did , indeed , take 90 ( " c of Ali 's earnings , his calculations leave him some $233,000 in the hole . " People ask me , ' Champ , how you gon na eat ? ' " he went on . " I say , look out there at that little robin pecking and eating . Look up at all the stars and the planets in the heaven . They are not held up there on the end of long steel poles . The Lord holds them in their orbits and the Lord feeds the birds and the animals . If the Lord has this power , will the Lord let His servant starve , let a man who is doing His work go hungry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ali has another hearing in his long battle with the draft board set for next week in Houston . He has appealed for reclassification on the grounds that he is a minister and a conscientious objector to war . He is not specifically concerned with the war in Vietnam . " I 'm against all war , " he said . " I 'm not following anybody . I said this before all this draft-card burning stuff . I still got my draft card . I made a speech at a white college in Buffalo , N.Y . and when I got to the room where I was gon na talk they had 34 signs stuck up on the walls and behind the platform . Signs said things like ' LBJ , how many kids did you kill today ? ' So I told the man who invited me there I would n't talk until they took all the signs down . They took them down . I 'm not criticizing the government I 'm asking to @# shyly . She was wearing the ankle-length dress the Muslims prescribe for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garment could not conceal the fact that she is pregnant . " I got a 17-year-old wife , she been watching me since she was 13 , " Ali said proudly . " She been trying to act like me all that time . She even looks like me , same color and everything . " " Ali ! " Belinda cried , feeling her fax tentatively as if she could discover any resemblance by touch . " I 'm prettier . ' she said . She was right . She returned to the kitchen and Ali went on . " Now in about five months we 're gon na have a child , maybe two . Doctor says she maybe going to have twins But the child is gon na look like me. cause its mother looks like me . And that 's the way I want it and that 's the way any man wants it . " He picked up another stack of cards from the table and glanced through than . " Here 's a lecture I made up prosing God is a human being , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dictionary say a mystery is something that is unknown . And the Christians divide God up into three parts ? the Father . the Son and the Holy Ghost ? contrary to the laws of nature and mathematics . Call Him a spirit . Can a spirit talk to us in His own language ? They call Him a spirit but they call Him He . His . Him . He walks and talks and sits . Elijah Muhammad teaches God is a man and we are made in His image . " He put the cards down . " Takes me at least six days to make an outline , " he said . " Hard work . 16. 18 hours a day . But this is all I want . U I was walking down the highway with a quarter in my pocket and a briefcase full of truth , I 'd be so happy . This is eternal work . If someone told me tomorrow that he would guarantee me the heavyweight championship for the next IS years , five fights a year , half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make me a well-versed minter of Elijah Muhammad making SA &; ? or $150 ? a week , I 'd be a minister And not because I 'm already a rich man , because I 'm not . " He opened a notebook and began to write down figures . " Here 's where it all went , " he said . " First wife , she cost me 5125,000 with lawyers ' fees and all . Then I 've spent  | give me justice . I 'm against all war . " If Ali 's appeals fail , he faces up to five years in the penitentiary , and he considers this possibility with philosophical calm . " The Koran says you must be tested , " he said . " God will try you . He tried Job and He tried Abraham and He tried Elijah Muhammad , too . Elijah spent three years in prison during the war , studying . If I was in jail tomorrow , I 'd study and preach to the other prisoners . The loneliness and the confinement and the food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who believes in a Supreme Being does not fear . " He shrugged the huge shoulders and smiled . " I 'm prepared , " he said . " I 'm thinking ahead . You see that pretty young wife . I 'll have one child , maybe two before I go to jail . Then , during the years I 'm in jail , they 'll be getting bigger , so when I get out I 'll already have them and I wo n't be starting at 30 . And my wife will still be young . " " I do n't know if I 'll be able to fight , " Ali said . " I mean I 'll have to see what the food is like . Right now I 'm 219 , so I 'm not far out of shape . I work so hard on these sermons and studying , I do n't have - time to do any exercise . The other day I ran four miles just to check my wind , and my wind was good but 1 got awful tired . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe three weeks . Seven weeks would be better . " Ali feels that Jimmy Ellis is the best of the pretenders to his throne . " He used to give me hell for four or five rounds in the gym , " he said . " He moves good , hits good with the right hand . And he 's had all that experience as my sparring partner . He can whip the other ones . Joe Frazier ? He 's like this . " Ali got up and imitated Frazier , moving in with his hands up near his face . " He gets hit , " he said . " Jerry Quarry I do n't know , " he said . " But I think Ellis will beat him . " He was up now , moving around the living room , shadowboxing . " People criticize me for holding my hands down , " he said , holding his h nds down . " Defense ai n't in the hands . It 's here in the legs . " " Move , move , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He held his hand up six inches from his nose . " Here 's where a man can reach , " he said . " Move , make him miss , move in , pow , pow , move out . Long as I know how far he can reach , I 'm going to be too far away . Do n't make any difference where my hands are . You notice , if I get in trouble , I get my hands up . " He brought his hands up by his face and ducked and wove , watching himself in the living room 's wall-size mirror . After a moment he sat down on a long couch facing the mirror and a builtin color television set . A cartoon featur-@# @# ing the Road Runner was on and he watched it for a moment . " That 's cute , " Ali said . " I like that . Always trying to catch the Road Runner and never getting him . It 's cute . " The phone rang and he picked and listened a moment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing me any good . He hung up and turned away from the TV set . " That 's my bus , " he " I paid $14,000 for it and it 's been in the garage for six months . I got no use for it . Man offered me $12,000 might as well take it . " He got up and went into the kit and made himself a cheese sandwich which he ate with great gusto . " I only eat one meal a day , " he said " Since I do n't get much exercise , I got to watch it . I do n't eat beef . I eat a lot of fish . Beef brings up the animal instinct in a man . I eat beef when fighting . " A stairway leads down from the kitchen to a den in the basement of the house . The floor of the den is cluttered the reminders of Ali 's days of glory pair of boxing gloves , a big scrapbook , two suitcases full of letters he has received from Muslims all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my past , " he said . " All of it down here , out of the way . Here 's my shoes . Boxing gloves . Things like that I got no use for now . They wo n't let me fight here and they wo n't give me my passport to fight anywhere else . If I was a cab driver I could drive my cab while I 'm waiting on this case . I got a million dollars in contracts in Europe , but they wo n't let me go . They think I 'm going to run away ? This is my country . I got 22 million people suffering here . I 'm not about to go away and never come back to America . " Back upstairs in the living room , he stood and began to dance in the effortless , fluid style that distinguished him as a fighter . He jabbed and moved sideways , avoiding a glass-topped coffee table in front of the couch . " He does that all the time , " said Belinda , who had just entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days he 's gon na break my mirror doing that . " Ali stopped for a moment , then held his hand up dramatically . " Ladies and gentlemen , " he intoned . " Here we are in Yankee Stadium and every seat is filled . And in this corner , at 223 pounds , right out of Alcatraz , is  | Muhammad Ali . He is 31 years old , and can he still have that same old power and speed after five years in prison ? " He changed to Muhammad Ali and stood up , shaking his hands over his head . " And in this corner , " he said , again : tie announcer , " we got Joe Frazier . He ' lien the heavyweight champion for five . cars and he has won 13 straight fights acid he is a young man . Can he beat Ali , real champion ? " He pantomimed ringing a bell and . a me out of his corner moving sideways , %1st , around the living room , pumping is left hand with wonderful speed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pow , pow , he hit Frazier with two left jabs . He 's moving and sticking . Pow , pow , pow , he hit Frazier three more lefts . He 's in and out . He missed a right ! " Ali threw a clumsy overhand right . " Now he 's sticking and moving some more , " he said , sticking and moving . " Frazier hit him in the stomach with a right hand . Frazier moving in on him . Oh , oh ! Frazier hit him in the head with a right hand and Ali is down ! " He fell on his stomach , shaking the house , and began to count dramatically . " One , two , three , " he had reached his hands and knees and was shaking his head dazedly . " Four , five , six , " now on one knee but obviously hurt . " Seven , eight , " he was up , wobbly . " Referee wiping off Ali 's gloves , " he said . " And here Frazier come after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ali began to move and stick , getting stronger and quicker , and by the time he rang the imaginary bell to end the round he was clearly in control again . The second round did not last long . " Ali looks like the old Ali , " he said . " Pow , pow , pow , pow ! Four left jabs to Frazier 's head . Pow , pow , pow , pow , pow ! " He pumped blows with both hands as fast as he could punch . " A machine gun combination ! Frazier is hurt ! POW ! Ali hit him with a left hook ! POW ! And a right hook ! POW ! POW ! A right and a left to the head and Frazier is down ! " He danced back to a neutral corner and counted slowly to six . " Frazier is up and Ali is after him , " he said , going after the phantom Frazier . " He 's got him backed into a corner . Pow , pow , pow , pow , pow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He backed away from the corner between the mir-@# ror wall and the front window and held up his right hand . " They stopping the fight , " he said . " And still champion of the world ? Muhammad Ali ! " He was puffing slightly and sweating and Belinda regarded him with a wife 's jaundiced eye . " He 's always doing that , " she said . " He 's crazy . " Later , in his car driving toward downtown Chicago , Ali was relaxed and becoming sleepy . Someone asked if he ever thought of himself as Cassius Clay and he shook his head . " Cassius Clay ? " he said as if it were the name of someone dimly recalled from his childhood . " Now and then someone call me Cassius Clay , but they do n't mean harm by it . I do n't make a thing of it unless it 's on national television with millions watching , then I correct them . But most of the time I let it go , cause if I gave everyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do anything else . " He pulled into a service station and a small , middle-aged black man came out . " What can I do for you ? " he said and did an exaggerated double take . He peered doubtfully for a moment . " You Cassius Clay ? " he asked . Ali grinned and nodded , then said , " What 's my name ? " The little man slapped his fist into his palm and thought for a moment . Then his face brightened . " Allah , " he said . " Allah . " " Muhammad Ali , " Ali said gently . " Muhammad All . That 's who I am . The preacher . " That 's who he is . And he is still the heavyweight champion .
