Behind the Facade <P> From the days of the Medici , Florence has been a city of treasures that every eye could see . In one direction was a chapel by Michelangelo , in another a dome by Brunelleschi ; here was a bronze door by Ghiberti , there a statue by Donatello . But these were only a part of Florence 's great legacy . <P> After 20 years of interviewing the city 's rich and noble families for La Nazione Italiana , Journalist Giorgio Batini , 37 , became haunted by the splendor of the private collections that ordinary people were never allowed to see . One day he approached the Contessa Bianca Cavazza , president of the women 's committee of the Florentine Red Cross , with a plan : Why not stage a huge public exhibition for the benefit of the Red Cross ? The journalist and the contessa started making the rounds , and one by one the Corsini , the Ginori , the Serristori , the Antinori , the Pucci and the rest agreed that for a few days they would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grey walls of their palazzi . <P> Last week , in 16 rooms and the art gallery of the Borghese Palace , some 600 of the " Secret Treasures of the Houses of Florence " went on display . It was , said Batini , " Florence behind the fagade , " and it turned out to be a spilled cornucopia of ancient masterpieces and oddments . There was everything from brilliant primitive paintings to snuff boxes shaped like glass slippers , 14th century Tuscan ceramics and the red-fringed picnic basket that an 18th century Corsini cardinal once took into the Vatican conclave from which he emerged , basket on arm , as Pope Clement XII . The Serristori loaned their priceless illuminated manuscripts , as well as two elaborately decorated Renaissance trays once used to carry water to noblewomen in labor . A plate bearing the arms of Roberto Strozzi and Maddalena de Medici marked one of the great weddings of the 16th century . A delicately inlaid table had been the gift of Clement VII to his Governor of Bologna , Francesco Guicciardini . <P> Of all the treasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most spectacular . On display was a magnificent triptych by Puccio di Simone and , a crucified Christ by Francesco D'Antonio di Bartolomeo . Probably the finest single work in the show was the Corsini Ma donna and Child with Angels , painted in the 1480s by Filippino Lippi . As far as Prince Tommaso Corsini knows , the Madonna has always belonged to his family , but last week , for a while at least , it belonged to all Florence .
