For the first time since France began its boycott of the Common Market last July , the foreign ministers of the Six met to resolve their differences in Luxembourg 's Htel de Ville . Not much had changed . Offensively , France took the offensive . <P> Airily remarking that he was " happy to see you all again , " Maurice Couve de Murville presented a ten-point proposal for changing the " style " of the Common Market 's Executive Commission in Brussels . He really meant the style of its president , Walter Hallstein , who conducts himself , in the opinion of Charles de Gaulle , too much like a head of state . De Gaulle has never quite got over the fact that , as President Kennedy 's guest in 1962 , Hallstein stayed at Blair House as any chief of state might . And when Hallstein toured India in 1963 , le grand Charles hit the ceiling : <P> " What is he doing in India when I have not visited there ? " <P> On the second day , Couve added a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Couve 's ten commandments by Jan. 31 . The E.E.C . Commission must be fused with the related European Atomic Energy and Goal and Steel Community commissions in a new 14-member body by April 1-and Hallstein was not one of the 14 the French had in mind . Couve told the ministers that they had until Feb. 1 to agree to let France retain its veto over their joint decisions , even though , under the 1957 Treaty of Rome , a qualified majority vote went into effect on Jan. 1 . <P> <P> Shock and sorrow ensued , for everyone had hoped that De Gaulle 's recent close squeeze at the polls would have chastened French policy . But Paris was still its old imperious self . The Five denounced the French demands and recessed the talks until Jan. 28 , when a showdown seemed inevitable .
