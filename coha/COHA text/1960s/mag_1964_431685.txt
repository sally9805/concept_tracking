 | CLOSE CALL IN SILO 10 By James Joseph HE voice from 60 feet underground ? from T Silo 10 's Atlas missile-launch center ? shot across the communications net : " The bird wo n't nest ... repeat . . . the missile has failed to nest . Keep your positions . Do not move . " The time was 7:35 p.m . The place : Silo 10 , Dvess Air Force Base , near Abilene , Tex . For only the second time in the missile age , a fully fueled and flight-ready " bird " ? an eight-story-high Atlas F ICBM , loaded with more than : 30,000 gallons of volatile liquid oxygen ( LOX ) and kerosene-like RP-1 fuel ? had jammed in its launching silo . Moments later came more bad news : " TV scan cameras see no boil-off vent ... the missile has apparently lost its COX vent " ( for gaseous oxygen ) . The bird was set to explode .  | It had begun , that final countdown , routinely enough , shortly after six p.m . The five-man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallons of LOX . Already aboard were 12.000 gallons of RP-1 fuel . Now the bird was cleared for lift-out . At his above-ground observation post 600 feet from the silo , assistant foreman Nels E. Erstad. 30 , reported to the Launch Control Center ? the LCC ? below , " W'e 're standing by ? and watching . " Helping Erstad keep check on the missile 's breathing was Lanny Rees , another assistant foreman on General Dvnamics Astronautics ' " sell-oft ? team . ( Before a missile is " sold ' ? accepted by the Air Force ? it 's put through a final launchready demonstration . " Doors opening , " the LCC reported , as the silo 's two 70-ton reinforced-concrete doors , each 30 inches thick , opened slowly . " SHE 'S breathing , " Rees told the LCC as billowing white GOX clouds suddenly swirled around the rising missile 's nose . The bird was a live one . But an Atlas must prove it can be held in launch readiness for an hour to pass Air Force scrutiny . Rees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valve , the complex remotely controlled breathing , mechanism high up on its nose . That GOX valve is to a liquidfueled missile what a blowhole is to a whale . Without it . an Atlas ca n't breathe . And it must ? or explode . Pressure ? the precisely right amount ? keeps the thin-skinned ( thinner than a dime ) bird literally inflated . Too notch , and it can explode . Breathing relieves the ever-building pressure of its tanked LOX . Close that boil-off valve and pressure zooms within the bird until it can burst the Atlas ' skin ? or worse : rupture the almost-as-thin bulkhead , all that keeps those 30.000 gallons t liquid ox -- gen and fuel from catastrophic mixing . @# For even so much as a teaspoon of liquid oxygen mixed with the fuel becomes one of man 's deadliest explosives ? with twice the power of nitroglycerine , and so touchy that merely running a hand through your hair can set it off . But even with the missile breathing normally , things were ? as always-tricky . For the big bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELEVATED out of its silo , a bird 's 4 GOX evaporates harmlessly . Nested , its breath is piped out safely by a 10-foot-long , 18-inch-diameter aluminum pipe ? the COX vent . But when the bird 's ultralow cold breath runs wild , it can freeze and blind a man , and make the steel cage and elevator cables that suspend the bird in its silo dangerously brittle . And , if they cracked , the missile might plunge from its perch , its fuel and oxygen uniting to produce a holocaust . So Rees and Erstad kept a close watch until the LCC ordered them back a quarter-mile from the silo just before the test was scheduled to end . Their job was done . During the missile 's descent ? when , briefly , its breathing would be shut off to avoid contaminating the silo with GOX ? a TV camera would keep an eye on things . Below ground ? as above ? all systems were " go ! " @#  | @# Pleased Air Force observers nodded their acceptance . At the master console , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abort button . Slowly , the great bird began its descent at 7:22 p.m . Seconds later the TV camera blurred out of focus . It caused no alarm , though . The camera had failed before . But complacency disappeared when an Air Force officer announced , " We have a lift failure ! " A console light , supposed to flash green when the bird finally nested , had instead flashed a warning red . Worried now , Pajak ordered a second camera focused on the bird 's boil-off vent . What the camera saw made him gasp . " GOX vent is missing . " The time was 7:35 p.m . The ordeal had only begun . But as Pajak huddled with his engineers , he knew time was fast running out . For the bird 's breathing had been shut off just before it had begun its descent . Now , with the GOX vent missing , opening that boil-off valve would flood the silo with lethal GOX . " Let her breathe in there , " an engineer gestured toward the silo , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she 'll blow the coop . " It was as deadly as that . " Get the hoses and pumps going , " supervisor Jack E. Kay ordered , and Erstad took off for the silo 's apron . As he did , the monitor from below reported , " Beheler ... is going in . " Wayne Beheler , engineer and onetime college fullback , who 'd supervised the installation of the silo 's elevator , went below to investigate what had gone wrong . With him went Pajak and two Air Force officers . They wore protective clothing , staticproof shoes , and emergency breathing packs ( inhale GOX and you can black out from too much oxygen ) . Inside , they stood and stared . They found that the silo 's 12-by-15-foot safety platform , normally locked flush to the silo 's side during launching , had somehow been sheared off by the descending elevator and had fallen 15 stories , making a shambles of the silo and its delicate gear . The 3,000-pound platform had torn loose the GOX vent and mangled the lift mechanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it had cut clean through a 500-gallon fuel tank on the silo 's very bottom . Now a dangerous pinkish flood of kerosene-like RP-1 rose ankle-deep in the silo . MINUTES later six other volunteers entered the silo . By the book they need n't have been there . A missile whose LOX ca n't be drained is expendable . The instructions in the launch-procedures manual are clear : Evacuate the " hole " and its LCC , and let her blow ? $10,000 , - 000 silo and all . But eight of them had said to hell with it . Now their only lifeline was a phone linked with the LCC . Over it , assistant foreman Sam Lovell , reading his pressure gauges , droned the bad news that minute by minute was growing worse : " LOX pressure rising . . . fuel-tank pressure falling . " They formulated a desperate plan to steady the bird 's internal pressure , and get her breathing safely again . If they got that far they 'd take a desperate stab at detanking the LOX . First Rees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kay set about boosting the fuel tank 's plunging pressure .  | Meanwhile Erstad reached the pump and fire hoses to begin the plan 's crucial second phase : wet down the bird 's steel cage and form an insulating ice sheath about it . This was needed to prevent the cold breath from snapping the metal . But those high-pressure hoses left no margin for error . Hit the bird instead of its cage , and they 'd freeze that GOX valve tight , strangling the bird 's breathing . That , or maybe cut through the bird 's thin skin . Scarcely was Erstad topside than the LCC reported that Rees and his crew had got the fuel pressure rising . And then ? ominously : " LOX pressure critical . . . going to bust the boil-off .. . ready or not . " UP TOP , they were ready ? Wayne Beheler , big " Dutch " Gritzmacher , Erstad , and a couple of others . " Aim straight , " Beheler yelled , his voice drowned in the screech of escaping GOX , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant , Erstad took aim at the elevator cables whitening with the cold 40 feet below , and let fire . The powerful stream hit the target squarely , saw it turn to ice ? and then the GOX fog closed in , obscuring the target . " Keep dousing , " a voice urged through the fog . Actually , they had no choice . Hold fire and the bird 'd be gone ? and so would they . Desperately , by blind instinct more than anything else , they fired their watery barrage point-blank through the fog . For minutes that seemed hours they poured it on . Then , suddenly , it was over ? at least for the moment . " LOX pressure safe , " the LCC 's gauge watcher boomed , as he hit the button that choked off the bird 's breathing . Inevitably , of course , the pressure would build again . And again the LCC would have to bust that valve ? and they 'd have to pour it on . But for the moment .. . As the GOX cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crewmen were jubilant ? but not for long . They 'd dead-eyed that steel all right . insulating it with ice without hitting the bird . But far below , a thick blanket of GOX had settled deep in the silo . If it condensed , if it mixed with that flood of fuel ... But they did n't have time to think of that . In the minutes ? perhaps 10 at nil t ? that remained before the LCC would again have to crack that boil-off valve . they had a critical job : find and refit the shattered GOX vent , then vent the bird 's breath safely from the silo . The vent lay in a puddle of fuel . As Gritzmacher bent to retrieve it , a jagged place on the vent ripped his hand . But Dutch scarcely noticed as he headed for Level 2 , where Rees and Erstad had rigged a makeshift sling from electriclight cord , the only " rope " they had . Slowly , they hefted the fat GOX vent , fitted it to the sling , and carefully ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inched it toward the GOX valve . They 'd scarcely got started when Lovell , from the LCC , warned , " Hold it .. . LOX pressure 's up . .. I 'm hitting the button ! " REES , staring down the GOX valve 's four-inch-diameter orifice , whirled , and shouted desperately over the intercom , " Do n't hit that valve , Lovell ... if you do , I 'm dead . " All of them , for that matter , were working within hand 's reach of the boiloff . If it let go now , they 'd be washed with a lethal , high-pressure blast of the - 297- degree stuff . And frozen alive in their tracks . " Get back ! " Lovell pleaded . " I ca n't hold it . Here she goes . " They vaulted backwards , but some of the gas hit Rees . He rubbed it off on his clothing and desperately fended off the cumbersome GOX vent . The steel pipe swung wildly in its sling , threatening at any moment to rupture the bird . For 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pipe that 'd carry the bird 's breath up and safely out of the silo . Finally , exhausted , they did it . Up top , somebody reported : " She 's GOXing . " The time was nine p.m. , an incredible hour and 40 minutes since she 'd gone wild . Considering she still held about 13,000 gallons , she might breathe herself dry in another 7 to 10 hours ? with luck . Their luck held only four hours . By one a.m. , when most of the crew had been sent home , the bird quit GOXing because the whole shaft was clouded in GOX . Dousing the bird 's cage , they 'd hit the GOX-vent 's fan , which was supposed to suck the lethal stuff out of the silo . Water had seeped into the enclosed motor housing and had frozen solid . Now GOX billowed solidly below them and the fan ? fitfully turning ? was all but dead . " She 's gone , " Erstad diagnosed , switching off the motor . If they let her run she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had no choice . The bird would have to be drained ? and there was n't a moment to lose . Ed Bradley , a detank specialist , was sure that , with care , he could do it ? somehow align the bird 's liquid drain pipe with the silo 's defuel tank . " I 'm for it , " Earl Coon , the overall supervisor said . Rees , Beheler , and Erstad cast their votes with Coon . Pajak made it unanimous ? they 'd detank . Win this one and they 'd be in clover . Lose ? and the clean-up squad would scrape up the pieces . " I 'll go along to carry Ed out if there 's trouble , " grinned 200-pound Dutch Gritzmacher , the crew 's nimblest hand . The problem was : Who 'd carry out Gritzmacher ? But they never thought about that . The rest of the team made up a kind of combo , there in the LCC : Rees on the pressure gauges , Beheler on the TV monitor , Pajak at the master console @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started the tape recorder . It would monitor every silo transmission as Bradley and Gritzmacher described ? if only for posterity ? each move they made . If the thing blew , they 'd at least have it recorded , and nobody would make the same mistake again . @#  | Silently , Bradley and Gritzmacher , looking like a couple of space-age plumbers in their gear , adjusted breathing masks , stuffed nonsparking beryllium tools into their kits , and headed for the hole . As the minutes tensed by , the intercom relayed every calculated move : the everso-cautious alignment of those gaping missile-to-storage-tank pipes ; the bypass arrangement Bradley concocted to bridge the gap ; the simultaneous rigging of repressuring nitrogen lines to keep the bird 's oxygen tanks under pressure as its LOX drained ? and the final clipped moments : Bradley : " I have a chill on the transfer lines . " ( Proof LOX was flowing . ) Gritzmacher : " No line leaks . " ( The patchwork was holding . ) Bradley ( excitedly ) : " She 's detanking . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Gritzmacher : " Frost mark dropping . " ( The telltale frost line on the missile 's liquid oxygen tank was visibly lower , confirming a dropping LOX level . ) And from Rees at his tank-pressure gauges : " LOX pressure dropping ... going down . . . down ( and finally ) . . . we are below critical pressure now . I am closing the GOX valve . " THEY 'D saved the bird . Deep underground an audible sigh ran through Silo 10 . For 7l hours they had fought a losing battle ? but they had finally won . For their part in saving the Atlas and Silo 10 on Sept. 19 , 1962 , 11 members of the sell-off team received Air Force commendations . Erstad , Kay , and Pajak won the Exceptional Service Award , the Air Force 's highest civilian commendation . The others received Scrolls of Appreciation .
