txt Retail business was the most severely affected aspect of the city 's economic life during the newspaper strike and shutdown . The effect was hardest on promotions of " big-ticket " goods , furniture and appli-ances , and on seasonal apparel business , which is especially impartant to mer- I chants during September and October .

Stores least affected by the ' strike and shutdown were those fashion and ' specialty stores that normally cater to mediumand upper-income customers . Edwin G. Roberts , president of Franklin Simon , which also has a store on 34th Street , reported that the stoppage came at a time when his chain 's sales were in a rising trend . " We are to a certain extent dependent upon our big neighbors , Macy 's and Gimbels , on Herald Square , " he said . " But when traffic on the street dropped , our sales did , too , despite the fact that they were running 11 per cent ahead for the year since Feb. 1 . So the strike 's effect was to cut our up-trend to slightly better than a break-even since Sept. 16 , when the strike started . " In other business fields , the effect in the communications and entertainment industries , and on Wall Street , was mixed . While radio and television broadcasters gained financially , movies and the Broadway theater found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hurt . Wall Street brokers said that the impact on their business was less pronounced than the previous newspaper shutdown , which began in December , 1962 .

Mail and telephone orders suffered the most . The metropolitan New York stores of E. J. Korvette " did not quite keep pace with the chain 's sales during the strike period , but the difference was only slight , " said Hilliard J. Coan , board chairman . Like other stores , Korvette used radio , direct mail and house-tohouse solicitation . This estimate was made by John J.

Guild members will also be paid , benefits for the days during ; the current week , that are ' not covered by salaries from their newspapers . This would amount to an additional $100,000 . I Macy 's was faced by a ! peculiar problem during the strike period . Having scheduled for today the opening of its new , radically designed " store-in-the-round " in the Elmhurst section of Queens , it found itself without much of the normal newspaper advertising exposure that should precede a store opening . " What we did was print one million , 24-page tabloid size circulars announcing the store which we distributed to potential and old customers in the middle of last week , " said Mr. Yunich .
