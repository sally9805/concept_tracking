The Soviet attitude stems largely from the fact that the kingpin of the system is not an impartial judge but a procurator , a sort of super district attorney and Big Brother rolled into one . As the state 's No. 1 law enforcer he conducts investigations , orders arrests , serves as prosecuting attorney , keeps an eye on courts for irregularities and carries out sentences . In effect , about all that is left to the court is to decide on the severity of the sentence . <P> Lately , some Soviet judges and lawyers , disturbed by this one-sided setup , have stirred up a strenuous debate on the procurator 's prerogatives .
