The White House protests , perhaps too much , that Spiro Agnew is not " on a leash . " that he does not have to clear his speeches with headquarters . If that accurately reflects the Agnew-Nixon relationship , it would seem to be one of the stronger arguments for censorship . <P> During last fall 's campaign , the gaffes that made Agnew the household word that he said he was n't ( " fat Jap , " " when you 've seen one slum you 've seen them all . " et al. ) were off-the-cuff blunders . These days his atrocities are premeditated . He seems unable to help it . The left , intellectuals , protesters , Democrats , just are n't his kind of folks . <P> In Dallas , he decried unrest on American campuses as the work of a " minority of pushy youngsters and middle-aged malcontents . " Last week the Vice President complained in Jackson , Miss. , that the South has too long been " the punching bag for those who characterize themselves as liberal intellectuals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he outdid himself in New Orleans by saying of the Oct. 15 Moratorium : " A spirit of national masochism prevails , encouraged by an effete corps of impudent snobs who characterize themselves as intellectuals . " <P> The Jordan Rule . The instant outrage greeting the last sally showed that Agnew 's intended targets are hardly exhausted . Perhaps the best put-down though , was the calm one that came from Senator William Fulbright . He was n't disturbed by the attack , said the Foreign Relations Committee Chairman ; " I just considered the source . " The newest gag in the G.O.P. Senate cloakroom : <P> Q. What is the new definition of effete ? <P> A. Effete is what Spiro puts in his mouth . <P> When he is n't amusing Republicans on Capitol Hill , the Vice President is infuriating them . Toward the end of the long dispute over extending the income tax surcharge , Agnew attempted to intervene on behalf of the Administration 's position . His intrusion in the delicate bargaining caused disruption rather than progress . Later , Idaho Senator Len @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Republicans , promulgated the Jordan rule : " Whenever I am lobbied by the Vice President , I will automatically vote the opposite way . " <P> Apparently Agnew learned nothing from the summer tax fight . Last week , when Maine Democrat Edmund Muskie proposed that the U.S. unilaterally halt testing MIRV nuclear warheads for six months , the Vice President issued the admonition that " no responsible person would propose that the President play Russian roulette with U.S. security . ' Agnew seemed to have overlooked the fact that Massachusetts Republican Edward Brooke and 42 other Senators were already promoting a resolution in favor of a bilateral recess in MIRV testing pending the start of Soviet-American arms control talks . The measure had seemed to be stuck until Agnew spoke out . Now Majority Leader Mike Mansfield wants the Foreign Relations Committee to begin hearings on it as soon as possible-a move that would discomfort the Administration .
