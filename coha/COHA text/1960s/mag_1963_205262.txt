Priests and kings , commissars and parliaments have all tried to put the world 's oldest profession out of business . None succeeded . Some sociologists , however , have gamely predicted that any nation that could eliminate unemployment would also eliminate prostitution . Girls only sold their bodies , the argument went , because there was no market for their other skills . <P> The Mobile Squad . But as prosperous , labor-short Western Europe last week prepared for the summer flood of tourists , it was glaringly apparent that the sociologists had , as usual , guessed wrong . Instead of vanishing , or even declining in numbers , prostitutes swarmed in every European capital , from Copenhagen to Rome and from Budapest to London . The European economic miracle did in fact take some prostitutes off the streets-but only to put them in cars . The " klaxon girls ' ' of Milan cruise Cathedral Square in Lancias and Dauphines , discreetly tooting horns and flashing their headlights to attract men 's attention . The latest fashion in Copenhagen has been created by " van-prostitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with beds . <P> In Rome , the first green leaves last week peeped along the Lungotevere , and flowers sprouted behind sidewalk tables on the Via Veneto . Spring had come , and the ladies could not be far behind . As early as 9 a.m. , tight-skirted hustlers prowl the square before Rome 's modernistic railway station ; by noon , they are ensconced on the benches of the Pincio Garden , casting provocative glances over the tops of sunglasses at passersby ; by dinnertime , they begin congregating near Rome 's biggest supermarket alongside Olympic Village and beside the vast ruins of the Baths of Caracalla . At 9 o'clock , on the corner of Via Sistina near the Piazza di Spagna. the prettiest prostitutes appear , dressed not as professional hookers but as sweet little schoolgirls . <P> In Paris , the police have succeeded in driving most brothels underground , but an estimated 20,000 prostitutes are still available to tourists and domestic males . The most expensive ( around $20 ) work the Champs-Elyses , and in a declining order of price and pulchritude come the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pigalle and Les Halles . Britain 's Street Offenses Act , passed in 1959 , has ended the processions of undulating whores that used to fill up Piccadilly Circus , Bayswater Road and Hyde Park . Borrowing a trick from their sisters in Amsterdam , many London prostitutes now sit at the upper windows of scruffy Soho flats for which they pay as much as $150 per week . <P> Upstairs Bar . Even the Communist bloc has its problems with prostitution , while indignantly denying that it exists . In Hungary , Budapest 's few whores are often booked up nights in advance by visiting Austrian and West German businessmen . " Elisabeth of the Duna , " a witty little Magyar who adorns the upstairs bar of the Hotel Duna , is so famous that guards on the Austrian border ask travelers , " Have you anything to declare ? Did you see Elisabeth ? "
