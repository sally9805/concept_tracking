Advanced anti-communism trades places with the enemy It becomes opposite-communism , and " opposites " are things alike in every respect save one . The final stages of American dissolution in Vietnam will be marked by imitation of the enemy 's , techniques . I have heard it foreshadowed in the talk of Saigon officialdom : discipline , a senior American civilian officer told me , is what the South Vietnamese government needs ; power , he said , is the only thing the Chinese can understand ; history , he said , will prove us right . In a remote provincial outpost I found two Americans who had appropriated to their own use , draconic Chinese methods of interrogation and indoctrination ( " motivation , " , in the American newspeak ) . The forced destruction of people 's beliefs can no longer properly be described as something " they " do . Torturously exacted confession and conversion are no longer things we fight against . These are now part of our own arsenal , weapons of our own struggle . The two Americans were leaders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The team included four Vietnamese instructor-cadres , two of these ex- , Vietcong . The dominant of the two Americans was a field representative of a civilian agency ; he was assisted by a ' Special Forces officer . Both were competent in Vietnamese language and custom , and dedicated to Vietnam , and their vision of its future . Their program was anti-Communist revolution ; they were training Popular Forces as revolutionary cadres . The texts were classic Communist handbooks on revolutionary warfare , books these Americans studied and clearly admired ; it does not go too far to say they were disciples , at least revisionist disciples , of Mao Tse-tung , Ho Chi Minh and Che Guevara . I lived with them during a night and a good part of a day . They briefed me and allowed me to see the work for myself . But it is not of this guerrilla program that I write . It is of a discussion I had with the Americans about torture and the transformation of Vietcong prisoners to anti-communism . The two Americans made clear that they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is properly done . The , interrogation methods , as the Americans themselves explained , are copied from those used most effectively by the Chinese . ( Of course , there are other precedents ? for example , the Inquisition . ) The treatment seems a compressed and abbreviated version of the procedures used on American POWs during the Korean War . The interrogator has at most four or five days before he must send the pris oner on . Physical torture is precluded . A special type of " mental torture " ( their term ) is instead inflicted . But it aims not merely at eliciting military information . The prisoner 's disclosures are at the same time a betrayal of his cause and a confession of his errors , a renunciation of belief . If the technique really is effective , and the Americans claim that it is , I think it must be because of some rather special qualities of revolutionary warfare and warriors . It must be understood that a Vietcong prisoner comes in with certain comprehensions and expectations that are deeply entwined with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement depends decisively on secrecy . Its members are visible daily to the enemy , but must be unknown to him . They maintain a hinterland conspiracy of silence , and a single traitor wrecks the organization of a whole village , perhaps a district . The guerrilla thus understands that secrecy is a first principle of the revolution . But by the same token , intelligence becomes a first principle of the counterrevolution . The prisoner , therefore , expects to be tortured for information and ultimately killed if he remains stead  --  fast . He meets his interrogators prepared to resist the worst : it is a test of his revolutionary soul . Something must be said as well of the two Americans who described the interrogation methods to me . First ? and it is a thing seriously to consider ? these men are not strangers , not people who have been metamorphosed by some satanic forces to point beyond our understanding or recognition . Met on a college campus or in a business office , they would not attract unusual attention . Their attitudes toward Vietnam are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country . They profess with sincerity their respect for the people ? so much so that they actively wish them a better fate . After I left them I had the sickening'feeling of " there but for the grace of God . . . . " The main protagonist  --  identified as " Mr. X " ? describes himself as an " agnostic atheist , " but clearly he believes in the Devil if not in ' God . In fact , his is a holy work : to exorcise the Communist devils possessing the Vietcong . He undertakes the prisoner 's " conversion " for the prisoner 's own good , he is " helping " the man , saving him . I ask , " What gives you the right ? " " Your belief , " he answers . It gives him the right to " proselytize . " And now consider this interview , what they said and what they revealed of themselves . What follows are excerpts from the tape recording I made of our conversation . Three asterisks in the transcript , indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three dots , that a portion of an answer is elided ; and a word in parenthesis followed by a question mark indicates an imperfect rendering on the tape and my guess of the , word involved . MR X , At this time the prisoner kind of feels an emotional dependence upon you because for two days you 've been piotecting him from the big outside ugly world that he does n't understand . feeding hnn good chow , talking with him , calling Rum a ( kanzbelo9 ) of the NLF , not the derogatory term of Vietcong . Then you indicate that this nice treatment that he 's had so far has not been disinterested good treatment , that we expect his cooperation . We 're cooperating with him in a sense ; we expect cooperation from him . This again reintroduces the whole issue of the big ugly outside world What 's going to happen to him now ? Well , he might tell you a couple of things , beginning with rather innocuous things . Well , you can imply that you know that already , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might rather ( uncalm ? ) him Then you might say , " Jeez , that scrape you got on your shoulder . .. it obviously needs attention ; we 'll have to give you some peniOctober 25 , 1965 cillin . " And while you 're giving him the penicillin , you 're telling hnn that , " You know , there are these other types of people who just . . . . " MR X : Actually , again , this is the technique that Captain Y . . and myself have been trying to promote in an advisory relationship Again , it 's a technique that 's been used most effectively by the Chinese , in which you 've pulled the man Out of his familiar environment . he 's dependent . . . upon you for his continual well-being . And even though the prisoner may ( resist ? ) , it 's kind of an emotional interdependence that 's created , and what you try and do is ( use ? ) this emotional interdependence in such a way that he comes to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It 's in effect brainwash- , . mg  --  is ' that the point of this ? MR . X ? No , what it is is breaking him down . But . . . once you 've broken him down , it comes to the point where he wakes up in a sweat one morning and tells you , " All right . ' , ' Then he tells you the names of the two people in his cell , or , he gives you the location of the camp that he just recently came from . Then you 're through- with him , in practical terms You 've got what you needed to continue operating But at this point , if you really believe in anything yourself , what you 've , got to do is give him something to hope for before you send . him back for further processing . Because you have just brought this individual to the lowest point in his life in terms of human meaning and existence . So at that point , that 's when You 've got to stress that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further processing : But for yog , what you 've just told us is the begin= fling of a positive affirmation . We just ca n't process you right into our unit ndiv , , because you do n't know what we stand for and what we 're fighting for , but we hope that some day you will be joining us . " See , we do n't hp.ve time to get any brainwashing . The Chinese can do that because they have POWs for months and months and months . If we get a guy , we 've got him for two to five days , and then he 's out of our hands . In that two to five days , we 've got to get the information we need . But we will not get the information we need by physical tor- , ture . We 've got to get it by an emotional and mental torture And you can do that because that 's what they 're least adequately prepared for . It 's what Americans are least adequately prepared for when they find themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of control do you have over Arvin Vietnam army types of interrogation ii.e. , physical tor-ture ? MR . X : Well again , that 's an advisory function And , what you 're trying to do is  --  this is just a traditional , feudal Asian society ; mainland style  --  and what you 're trying to do is ' change the course of warfare in Asia . To some extent this has been done : the Chinese People 's Liberation army , it 's happened probably in the Japanese army , the Japanese Self-Defeiase and r Home Defense armies , But until the end of , World War II , we always thought of the Japanese army as a real cruel , vindictive bunch of cutthroats , Well it turned out in post ' World War II analysis that the Bataan Death March was something that they handled to the best of their ability , given the available transport and the way that they would have handled their own prisoners . They just moved them , and they moved them as fast as they could . People who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in some other cases  --  just according to the individual guard  --  were bashed and thrown aside . Vietnamese to our eyes seem rather cruel sometimes to prisoners , but they 're not doing this with any ideological vengeance . They 're doing that ' because that 's just been the bent - of warfare in Mainland Asia for a thousand years , and what we have got to try to do - is sophisticate it ? and tell them , " Look , that 's just not the way . " It 's a slow process , we 're attempting a reformation of a whole society . SAHLINS . What practical is being-done to discourage this kind of thing ? MR . X : Well , guidance on the spot ' CAPTAIN D ( Sahlins ' escort ) . It 's up to the individual advisers MR X- The individual adviser giving guidance , on the spot . CAPTAIN D : Sometimes it 's successful , sometimes not CAPTAIN Y : In most cases , it 's not SAHLINS From what you say about mental torture , you wouldn't.iyiake any distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental torture ? " MR X. Hell , no ! I do n't make any distinction in morality at all : torture - is torture , and when you fuck around with a guy 's mind and his whole basic raison d ' ? tre , you 're really hurting him ? especially when he 's prepared mentally , spiritually , for the physical torture . Samor.is : Then the attempt to discourage Vietnamese water torture . is , just ' because the other type does n't offend American sensibilities as much ? MR . X ? No , it 's not because of that . Because we do n't concern ourselves here with American sensibilities . We concern ourselves with what will work . CAPTAIN Y : It 's relatively ' ineffective . MR . X. It 's ineffective . It may sound hard-boiled to say , that we do n't concern ourselves with American sensibilities  --  but we do n't . We 're concerning ourselves with , Vietnamese sensibilities . SAHLINS . What about the sensibilities of the Americans who are involved . . . the person who 's torturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to most of the simple-minded Americans who get involved in Vietnam  --  that 's all the boobus Americanus that H. L Mencken spoke about ? undoubtedly they think that- - the mental and emotional torture we 're talking about is the least objectionable , because they 've never really paused to seriously reflect- ' about it themselves ; or perhaps they did not go through the experi ? ence of being a POW in the Korean conflict themselves . And they can probably tell you , " Oh , Jesus , I 'd try and stop that physical torture , because I know it 's just wrong " ? you know . But we - think that we 're looking into it a little more deeply , and we see that the mental and spiritual torture that we bring a man through to the Point where he voluntarily gives you the information is pretty rough stuff Ito get involved in too But it works SAHLINS . How do you offset the damage to yourself ? , MR Your belief . Your belief . you have to sincerely believe that in the long run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AA cure . If you 're just breaking the guy down for the sake of getting a poor helpless alcoholic who 's - hipped on NLF propaganda to admit that . he was wrong and give you the information , then you 're going to send him out in the street a ' crushed derelict , then there 's something wrong with you But you have to really - believe , as we do  --  although we get discoiiraged sometimes - by our Vietnamese counterparts  --  you have to really ; - believe that you 're helping this guy to something better . SAHLINS Conversion , from communism is involved in the torture . MR . X : ' Conversion from anything - to anything involves a certain degree of self-torture . ' We just , accelerated the process because we need that fucking information . SAHLINS . This is better for him ? MR X He 's alive , and you can still help him . . . . MR . X : Most Americans , unfortunately , do n't bother to think deeply about the stuff they get involved in and they make superficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this guy physically because we 're all part of the same ( background ? ) " ? CAPTAIN Y If you ask you 'll get probably 80 per cent of the people ' U S military will say , " Well , I did n't get involved in , it . When they capture them , when they , capture the Vietnamese Communists , I - just turn my back and go and have a cigarette . " MR X. They take a drink from their canteen and light up a cigarette And that 's discouraging . . I 'd rather get ? not get involved in not in the actual physical torture myself  --  but I 'd rather be right there and see it done , and then laugh like a horse when it does n't work and they do n't get the information And then in the long run you 're affecting the situation when you just laugh at this guy and say . " Look , you think he 's gon na break ? So you cut up his stomach a little bit and his insides ' fell out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he did n't talk a bit " And maybe it 'll make the guy think , you knOw , and ten times later , after ten more people have faded out because he physically tortured them , maybe he 'll say ' " Okay , wise American adviser , what would you do ? " . . We have a moral responsibility , it seems to me , once we 've stepped into this country to involve ourselves in the complete fabric of the country , and to understand it , and then try and help the Vietnamese to look at some different alternatives . . . We should be acting as a catalyst , as a thinking catalyst in Vietnam But you can not be a catalyst unless you know the entire fabric of the thing And lighting up a cigarette when they bring a prisoner in for questioning is ? well , that 's an immoral CAPTAIN Y. It 's just like saying , " It does n't happen " MR . X : That 's just about the height of . immorality , I think To think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every man is an island ; or at least when it is comfortable , when it 's comfortable for me to be an island unto myself , then I am , and the bell 's tolling for that poor fucker under the knife , not me . That 's real bad And again , it 's a simpleminded approach . Mr X had mentioned that one of the rules imparted to the cadres in training was " be kind to prisoners " I asked if that was n't a rule he disobeyed MR X Well , if the final result of it is  --  it 's a cruel process  --  but the result of bringing him closer to you , of conversion  --  it 's a tortuous process of conversion  --  but the result is , a kind one . . . If you believe in your program , this is what you do . . . SAHLINS ? Do you believe in breaking people down so they agree with your program ? And breaking them down justifies the end ? MR X No . . That 's why we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into our unit at this time . . . SAHLINS : Either you will rehabilitate him by converting him to your belief or you 're going to leave him a mental wreck . . . Can your ends be so God-given as to give you this right among humanity to do this ? MR X I do n't know . I do n't really believe anybody 's hands are God-given . I 'm an agnostic atheist . SAHLINS : No , your ends I 'm not asking you for religious beliefs . What I 'm asking IS , do you believe you have the right to impose by this method MR . X ? I think I 've got the right to try , Nobody 's got the right to succeed ? guaranteed . But everybody 's got the right to promote and proselytize what they believe . CAPTAIN Y If we do not break this guy , if we do not attempt to change his ideas , then in essence what have we done We 've said that basically he 's right ! SAHLINS No , that is n't so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle in a democratic system MR X : Oh wait , this is where we began . . . I 've had some tremendous conversations with these guys , and we begin by agreeing to disagree . But you can soon get this guy so flustered and so shaken up that before he knows it , he 's agreeing with you  --  because his assumptions to begin with were rather vulnerable . SAHLINS But that is n't the issue here . The issue here is Whether you will impose your will by this technique , which ls MR X We do n't know what our will is yet SAHLINS You will impose your ideas by this technique MR X. What ideas ' ? SAHLINS ? . . . I asked the question , how do you justify the effect upon yourself of acting in this way ? And you said you 're doing the guy a service Now , I 'm asking - you , do you believe you have the right to impose your will on somebody , impose what you believe MR X We are not imposing our will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken him ' and gotten the information , he 's a free agent . MR X Not impose will  --  if he fails to accept . . . an alternative . And not our alternative ; there are a number of alternatives Because in essence that 's what we 're trying to show him . SAHLINS . . . So as a matter of fact by this process you either transform him from that belief into one of a range of acceptable beliefs , or you will leave him a mental wreck MR . X. But we do n't leave him this way . We have brought him to a point where he realizes that the faith he placed in his previous system was essentially not powerful He has volunteered the information At this point he 's got to find a new way He 's got to have a way out of his dilemma , and the people at the training centers should be skillful enough to point out to him a number of alternatives . SAHLINS ? We come back to the question whether you have the right  --  by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny him the belief that he came in with in his hand , and only accept a set of alternatives which you proposeMR X ' Listen , I 've met guys . . . We had a guy in Phu Yen Province in the summer of ' 63 who was the propaganda director for the NLF in that province , and boy , we just worked ourselves literally ragged in four days trying to bring that guy to the point where he 'd tell us a few things , and he was tremendous  --  just tremendous . Did n't tell us a thing . SAHLINS . You admire this guy ? MR . X : Tremendous  --  tremendous SAHLINS . So ' . you admire more a per-son who will not acquiesce to the thing that you say is right than one who does ? MR . X. No , not true . I did n't say that at all . I admire a guy who will tortuously admit  --  if he really believes  --  that , " Qh Jesus , I never thought about that before . Those guys NLF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing something else . " A guy like that who will examine his previously arrived conclusions and change his mind , I admire thatSAHLINS ? That 's very admirable , but it does n't describe the process you went through , which was to leave him in a situation where either he takes this set of alternatives which you , give him , or he is a mental wreck . MR . X. Remember , this was an act of of on his part , where he yields the information voluntarily . But it 's only a beginning , it 's only a beginning ; and it 's not fair to leave him at the point where he 's just made the beginning . MR . X. It 's just like an alcoholic An alcoholic can attend the meetings and he can see everybody else get embarrassed , and if he does n't want to join them he can just back out again But once a guy begins to join this little society of alcoholics CAPTAIN Y These cadres we have as instructors ? these ex-VC , ex-NLF , ex-Viet Minh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in their own mind , when they turned , came to the government . MR . X : . .. what we 're trying to show these guys when we 're interrogating them , through- this tortuous process , is that you 're not better off under the NLF . ' " Your whole series of assumptions has got to be reexamined here , and we 're here to help you re-examine them . And , Jesus , there 's some guys here have got some more basic ideas of how ' they 'd like to examine you , but we 're just holding these guys off . and we 'll take good care of you . " That 's kind of a dirty trick ? but when you 've only got four days . . . . SAHLINS : Have you done this with Vietcong MR X We do n't do , anything because e we 're advisers  --  in very sense .
