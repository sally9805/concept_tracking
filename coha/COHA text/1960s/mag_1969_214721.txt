THE MILITARY PHILOSOPHERS by Anthony Powell . 244 pages . Little , Brown . $4.95 . <P> <P> Anthony Powell 's A Dance to the Music of Time , a serial novel issued in fairly regular installments for more than 18 years , can now be seen for what it is : a great prose composition in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts . Powell invites his dedicated ( though still small ) readership to think of his work in musical terms . The descriptive form that suggests itself for his nine novels is a series of piano concertos with variations on a single complex theme . Powell 's narrator , Nick Jenkins , is , of course , at the piano . <P> The period covered in Military Philosophers , the ninth of the series , is roughly from 1942 to V-E day , an era that would seem to call for the verbal equivalent of massed bands , with effects by real cannon in the manner of Tchaikovsky 's 1812 Overture . Though Powell 's narration continues pianissimo , the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument , delicate but forceful because precise . <P> Byzantine Labyrinth . In The Valley of Bones ( the seventh novel ) , Nick Jenkins was an officer in a Welsh regiment training for the invasion . Now he has been transferred to the offices of the British general staff in Whitehall . In that bureaucratic maze , Powell 's khaki characters may seem less military than dilatory . But anyone who has inhabited the Byzantine labyrinths of noncombat wartime staff headquarters will recognize the wry truth of Powell 's picture of intrigue , futility and boredom . <P> Powell 's human comedy exploits to the full the incongruities of manner and matter inherent in his jumble of diverse characters , classes and accents . It seems surprising that even the British Empire could have converted such a collection of civilian highbrows , esthetes and scholars to effective military ends . Outside Whitehall , bombs are succeeded by rockets . The London toll of death and damage mounts . Throughout there is a sharp impression that what Powell refers to as " our incurable national levity " is a strong clue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much hope , and thus against bitterness at hope defeated . " Not all the fruits of Victory are appetising to the palate , " an esthete says after V-E day , as Poland , Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia are transformed from Nazi-occupied countries into Communist satellites . " An issue of gall and wormwood has been laid on . " <P> Jenkins ' position as liaison officer with various Allied military missions gives Powell a chance to extend his insular comic powers to foreign fields . It also allows a sidelong glance at some of the larger tragic ironies of World War II . With remarkable feeling , Powell conveys the consternation of those concerned with Anglo-Soviet relations when chilling evidence comes in that the Russians have massacred 10,000 Polish officer-prisoners in the Katyn Forest .
