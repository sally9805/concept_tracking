I came home to Georgia by jet . The flight from New York to Atlanta was uneventful , but as the plane taxied toward the terminal I felt slightly uneasy . Georgia had just gone for Goldwater ; Georgia was still Georgia . Walking along the corridor to the main lobby , I heard cracker twangs all about me ; these , in my childhood , were the sound of the enemy , so that even now I react when I hear them , and I immediately suspect any white man who has a Southern drawl . Yet I could see no signs telling me where I should eat , drink , or go to the rest room . The white passengers seemed totally unconcerned with me . I could see a change in their eyes , on their faces , in the way they let me alone to be me . I was on my way to the Southern Airlines counter to confirm my reservation to Valdosta . Suddenly I saw a brown arm waving at me from a phone booth . There , in the booth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family and mine had been Negro Baptist leaders in Georgia for almost fifty years ; I first got to know him when I was in college and he was in junior high school . Now I was on my way home to Valdosta for Harper 's to write about the changes in my town and to give a sermon in my uncle 's church ; Martin was on the way to the island of Bimini to write his Nobel Prize acceptance speech . Martin and I stood in the lobby and tried to talk , but to no avail . We were continuously interrupted by white people who rushed over to shake his hand and pat him on the back . I could hardly believe that I was in Atlanta , that these were white people with twangs , and that they were saying what they were saying . Many of them asked for Martin 's autograph ; a few of them recognized me from television or from the dust jacket of a book and asked me to sign slips of paper . They were an incredible lot : a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score of civilians including the brother of the present Governor of Georgia , and three Negro girls . One stately old white man walked up to Martin and said , " By God , I do n't like all you 're doing , but as a fellow Georgian I 'm proud of you . " My flight home was several hours away , and I had made a reservation at a motel near the airport . As Martin and I were parting , the loudspeaker announced that the motel bus was waiting for " Dr. Lomax . " A Negro porter gathered my baggage and led me to the bus ; he put my bags on the ground and I tipped him . A few seconds later I saw the white bus driver , and I knew I had reached a moment of confrontation . It seemed an eternity as I glanced up and down , from the white driver to my baggage ; I remembered all those years I had spent serving white people as a bellboy , a shoeshine boy , a waiter . The driver , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He picked up my bags and put them in the bus . This is what the Republic has clone to me and twenty million like me ? I never felt so equal in all my life when I saw that white man stoop down and pick up my bags . " Get right in , sir , " he said . The motel people were the same . They acted as if there had never been such a thing as segregation . I ate and drank where I pleased . Later I had to break away from three white men and their woman companion who latched onto me in the motel dining room and insisted that I party with them until my plane left . If Icame back home to the land tilled and served by my fathers for four generations . Valdostans , like most people , are children of fixity ; as individuals and as a tribe they find a crag , a limb , a spot of earth ? physical or emotional or hatband they cling on for dear life . They change without growing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What frightens them , as with most people , is the sudden discovery that what they are ? how they have lived all their lives ? stands somehow in the path of history and of progress . One can go home again if he remembers and accepts the land of his birth for what it was , if he understands what that land has become and why . The homecoming is more complete if one admits that he and his land have shaped each other , that from it springs much of both his weakness and his strength . Only as I walked down River Street toward the place I was born did I realize how much of a child of this land I am : its mud squished through my toes as 1 romped on unpaved streets and alleys ; its puritanical somnolence settled over my childhood dreams and all but choked me into conformity . It was on the corner of River and Wells Streets , when I was eight years old , that a white man ordered his bulldog to attack me simply because I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the big white house on the corner . They saw the incident from the front porch , and Mrs. Cranford ran into the street to my rescue and drove the man away with shame . River Street has grown old without changing very much . The weed field that stretched between here and Jackson Street Lane is still a weed field ; the old warehouse that sat at the edge of the field is now a surplus food distribution center . The houses are the same houses they were when I was a child . R. P. Lewes , as I shall call him , lived on this block . The summer before my junior year in college I was a handyman in his shop . Mr. Lewes would entertain his customers with dramatic descriptions of lynchings he had attended . His favorite story was about the night three Negroes were killed in a swamp near the Florida line . Lewes would advise his customers to get to a lynching early and stake out a choice spot on the killing ground . " But if the crowd is already there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " get down on your all fours and crawl between their legs so you can get up close to the nigger . " One night . I was cleaning the store when three of Mr. Lewes ' cronies came in . " By God , " he said to them , " this has been a rough day . Let 's get a pint of moonshine and find some nigger bitches and get our Tuck changed . " Finally the stories became too much , and one day I threw down my shoeshine rag and went home . ( After all , I was almost a junior in college and an official in my campus NAACP . ) Lewes ' son drove to our house and insisted that I return to work . My grandfather , the minister of the Macedonia First African Baptist Church , flatly said I did n't have to work in a place where my race was abused . R. F. Lewes , Jr . assured Grandfather that he would see to it that his father stopped telling lynch stories while I was in the shop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me and put his arms around my shoulders . " Louis , " he said , eyeing me as if I were a wounded animal , " I would n't hurt you ! " During my visit home I saw Mr. Lewes on the street . He is very old and walks with a stick . A few weeks before , a Negro man had sat on a bench on the courthouse lawn next to him . Recoiling in anger , Lewes began jabbing the Negro in the ribs with his walking stick . The Negro called the police , and they told Lewes that the courthouse bench was for all the people , and either to calm down or move on . Mr. Lewes moved on . Ours was a curious ghetto . Jackson Street Lane was the boundary line between the Negro and white sections along River Street , For one block Negroes lived on the north side of the street ; the south side was completely white . To compound the oddness ? the kind of thing that keeps the South on the thin edge of insanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remember how their menfolk ran into the street rejoicing the night Max Schmeling defeated Joe Louis . The two white houses are still there , but I can not for the life of me account for the white people who had lived in them . They were of another world ; I did not know their names , who they were , or what they did . For that matter , I ca n't recall a single white person in the entire town whom I really knew when I was a boy . There were a few white people ? R. F. Lewes and the man whose bulldog attacked me ? whom I truly feared and , more than likely , hated , There were a few white people , Mrs. Cranford for example , whom I trusted and , perhaps , loved . But whatever understanding I had of all of these people was based on nothing more than surface encounter . The house where I was born is torn down , the land covered with brush . The corner grocery store , built by a grocery chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyesore and a public hazard . This land still belongs to us . My Uncle James . now the preacher at the Macedonia Baptist Church , and I are the last of the Lomaxes . Soon we must sit down and decide what to do about the land . Where my grandmother 's living room once was , there are wild weeds ; thistles cover the place where my grandfather used to retire on Saturday nights to prepare his sermon . There are tall bushes in the potato patch and creeping vines in the bait bed . There are other changes . The new freeway that runs from Atlanta to Jacksonville has ruined the sucker and catfish hole where Grandfather and I used to fish . The new city hall and its grounds sprawl over the homesites of more than twenty families , Negro and white . The mud swamp on the Clydesville Road is now the airport , and the Dasher High School from which I was graduated twenty-five years ago is now the J. L. Lomax Junior High School , which is named after my Uncle James . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fact that I knew exactly how many people there were in the town-14,592 . ( My grandfather used to say that this figure included " Negroes , white people , chickens , cows . two mules , and a stray hound dog . " ) By 1960 the population had more than doubled , and it is predicted that there may be 75,000 people living here by 1980 . Since I was a child the number of people working in agriculture has decreased threefold ; the corresponding increase in trades , technical , professional , and government employees is expected to continue . Despite the occasional new sight , Valdosta , like most American cities and towns , is old and tired and falling down . A few weeks ago , not far from my old home , a chimney fell from a dilapidated building and killed a small child . In October of last year the city manager pleaded with the mayor and the city council for power to initiate a comprehensive housing code . His research showed that 33 per cent of Valdosta 's housing is either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town 's dwelling units are owner-occupied , and that only slightly more than five hundred new housing units will be erected during the rest of the 1960s . The city manager wanted to force the owners of deteriorating properties to fix them up , the owners of dilapidated buildings to tear them down under the threat that if they do n't the city will . He wanted to do something about the lack of recreational facilities for young people . So far he has not succeeded , but he is still trying . A referendum that would have levied two bond issues for parks and recreation recently was defeated , with about 10 per cent of the registered voters participating . But in October a one-million-dollar school bond issue won the voters ' approval , although less than two thousand of the city 's eight thousand registered women voters bothered to go to the polls . Apathy plagues the town . The people , both Negro and white , seem to have run out of gas . They simply do n't care about civic improvements . The referendum for parks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was defeated by seventeen votes . Yet one night I walked up and down Patterson Street , the white mecca , and saw scores of boys and girls slinking into darkened store alcoves and alleys . Then I went down along South Ashley Street , the Negro section , and saw even more young people by Louis E. Lomax 155 darting into back streets , petting in open lots , dancing to funky music in questionable " soda and ice cream parlors . " IV As far as public accommodations go , Valdosta is an open town . I ate where I chose and went where I pleased , talking with whomever 1 wished of both races . Like most Southern towns , this one had moments of racial tension during the first days of integrated caf ? s , lunch counters , and theaters . But a well-disciplined law force invoked the law of the land . While police chiefs in other Southern towns were rousing the white rabble , the Valdosta police chief was traveling through the swamp farmlands on the town 's outskirts telling white men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town to keep calm . The Negroes were told to eat , not just demonstrate , and the whites were warned to keep the peace . They both did just that . Whenever and wherever Negroes have pressed their case there has been compliance with the Civil Rights Act . This did not happen all by itself . A loosely organized interracial council arrived at reasonable , step-by-step goals . I think the major preventive act took place when the white power structure 156 GEORGIA BOY GOES HOME yielded to demands for Negro policemen . The sight of Negroes whom they knew and trusted policing their community gave Valdosta 's Negroes a pride and a sense of personal security they had never had before . My town has not made ugly national and international headlines because the white power structure , led by three key men , took a long look at the turmoil that confronted so many places in the South and decided it would not happen in Valdosta . E. M. Turner , the seventy-two-year-old editor of the local paper , took the same position with me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor of the paper since I was a child . I had wanted to be a reporter and a writer , to learn the fundamentals of my craft , but I could n't even get a job as a delivery boy . The first essay I ever wrote won me an honorable mention in a contest sponsored by the paper ; they announced that I was a Negro and they misspelled my name . Yet E. M. Turner sat with me now for almost an hour and a half . He traced the rise of Valdosta from a one-crop town that trembled at the thought of the boll weevil to a town which changed its economy to one based on turpentine , pine trees , and resin . He sketched out the semi-industrial era that lies ahead for the town . Our talk moved on to the race issue . " I 've never had any trouble with nigras , " Turner said . " I may not like the Civil Rights Bill , but it 's the law of the land and it must be obeyed . But let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked to my cook ; she is a sweet old nigra woman who has been with us for years and she told me she did n't want her grandchildren going to school with white children . " I heard E. M. Turner well , and I thought to myself that I have yet to meet a white man , in the South or the North , whose cook believed in integration . Yet I wondered how , without integrated schools , such a man as Turner expected us to turn out Negroes equally prepared for the American job market . I decided to ask a significant question : " Would you hire a Negro reporter if he was qualified ? " Turner did not hesitate . " I 've never been faced with the issue , " he said . " I 'm not sure what I would do . " Later that day , when I had a talk with a local businessman , I saw something of the anguish that afflicts many white Valdostans of my age . His brother-in-law lives in Colombia and is married to a Colombian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring his wife to Valdosta for a visit ; the proposed visit was , of course , vetoed with vigor . " Lord , how ashamed I am , " he told me . " I 'm afraid to have my own brother and sister come to my home . " He is a devout member of a Protestant church in Valdosta . His church raises money each month to keep an impoverished Negro church of the same denomination going . " We raise that money . " he told me , " to keep the Negroes from coming to our church . I was just horrified when I saw how my fellow white Christians reacted when the question of integrating the two churches came up . " But it was another realization that really troubled him , " Now take you , " he said . " I 'd like to have you in my home , to sit down to prayer and break bread with my family . My wife feels the same way . But we 'd be afraid to invite you . " " I 'd invite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not afraid . " " But I 'd be afraid to come , " he shot back , pounding the desk with anger at his world and himself . " In other words . " I said , " there is a sense in which I , a Negro , have more freedom than you have . " " That 's true . " he replied . " Everything is so confused down here . They would n't bother you and your Uncle James if you invited my family to your home . But they would get after us if we came . " He turned in his chair , dropping me out of his sight as he faced the wall and let his eyes drift toward the ceiling . " But I did vote for Goldwater. " he added , speaking more to himself than to me . " Somebody has just got to stop the Communists from taking over the world . " V IT he Goldwater victory bung like a frightening cloud over the well-meaning white Valdostans who were trying to find a way out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for Goldwater 's carrying Valdosta was George C. Cook , the seventy-three-year-old owner of the radio station . Cook came to town thirty years ago and became a leader in the business community ; he has been president of the Chamber of Commerce and has spearheaded the drive to get more industry ? " particularly those that will give these nigger women on relief something to do , " he explained to me ? into Valdosta . He made his station the voice of Goldwater conservatism and the White Citizens ' Council . The week before the election , Cook encountered one of Valdosta 's most respected Negroes in the post office . " Doctor , " Cook said to the Negro , " / want you to go home and call all your friends and tell them to tune in on my station tonight at seven-thirty . We 're going to give the niggers and Jews hell tonight and I sure want you and your people to hear it . " I talked with Cook for more than an hour . " Now I came out for Goldwater , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm a Democrat . That , " he went on to say , pounding his chest . " is in here , in my heart . I could no more be a Republican than I could fly . But I just could n't stomach that Kennedy-Johnson crowd and the way they are taking over the rights of the states and the individual . " Now as for this integration business , I do n't see what all the hell 's about . We never had any trouble with niggers . I was against the Civil Rights Bill but when it became the law of the land I felt we 'd better try and live with it . One of my friends called me up and told me he 'd gotten word that the niggers were coming to his lunch counter to demonstrate . lie said he was going to feed them if they came there . I told him , by God , to feed them niggers and he 'd find out that once he fed them , and they had made their point , they would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bursting into laughter . " that 's exactly what happened . Them niggers ate , then they left and ai n't a one of them black sonsabitches been back there since . " Let me tell you something , Louis , " he said suddenly . " I lived with niggers all my life ; I grew up with them and played with them ; there was n't a bit of trouble . Why a sweet , old black nigger woman helped raise me ; she was as sweet a woman as God ever let live . And if and when I get to heaven I 'm going to look up that nigger woman and kiss her on the cheek . " There ai n't going to be no trouble here , " he said . " A few young niggers and young white trash might try to start something ; then the old heads , nigger and white , will keep things under control . What we need in this town instead of agitation is some new industries with nigger jobs , so these nigger men can feed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pay cheek . That 's what we need to keep Valdosta going . Why , the niggers are pouring into town by the carloads every day , and if we do n't find something for them to do we are going to have one hell of a mess in this town before too long . Yes sir , that 's what this town needs : nigger jobs , for nigger men and women . " On the subject of jobs , Corner Cherry , a diametrical opposite to Cook among the business community , feels the same way . Cherry has been president of the Chamber of Commerce and theby Louis E. Lomax 157 Rotary Club , and a prime mover behind the biracial commission . He is representative of the new thinking among white Valdostans . " The way I see it , " he says , " the economy of the nigra community is the root of the problem . Once the nigra can earn a respectable pay check , most of the agitation will die down . " The median income for a Valdosta white family in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And there is a chilling prophecy in a recent economic study of the town . The study predicts that by 1980 the median income of Valdosta white families will be $9,500 , while the income of Negro families will reach only $4,250 ? more than twice the present disparity . Corner Cherry and George C. Cook have a point . Somebody , somehow , had better do something about Negro income in Valdosta or there will be real trouble in the future . VI Ifound no tension whatsoever in the Valdosta Negro community . The Negro masses undulate along the streets , oblivious to what is going on in the Congo , in Red China , or in Mississippi . The county hospital has been completely integrated , and the authorities have shut down the old back entrance marked " colored . " Yet despite the fact that the leaders have told local Negroes to use the front door , one witnesses the pathetic spectacle of their going to the same place to find a back way in . What mainly struck me is that there are more of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are the citizens of " Niggertown , " the habitu ? s of juke joints , of pig-foot alley and crumbling shanties . Their children pour into school , only to drop out . Talking with these dropouts one comes away knowing that they never really dropped in . They do n't know anything ; they ca n't do anything . Here , among the black masses , is the greatest monument to my town 's ? the South 's ? wickedness . It is a society which continues to grind out hundreds , thousands , millions who are totally defeated , who are alienated from that society from the day they are born . The Valdosta black bourgeoisie serve the black masses . They teach them in school , pull their teeth , prescribe medicine for their livers , tell them about Jesus on Sunday morning , sell them life insurance when they are young , and bury them when they die . That is the way it was thirty-five years ago ; that is the way it is now . Their only saving grace ? and this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to accept , without recourse to background , any person who can traverse the maze that leads from Shantytown to professionalism . I was born to the black bourgeoisie ; I stumbled and floundered for twenty years ; and there were grave doubts that I would ever validate my heritage . Yet I had schoolmates who were up from the trash pile ; some of them made it , and they are now solid members of the Valdosta Negro middle class . It would be wrong for me to say that they do n't care about the black masses . They do care ; they care , at times , almost to the point of nervous breakdown . Their problem , essentially , is the Caine as that of the concerned white men of Valdosta : the monster created by the Southern way of life is so terrifying , and becoming so gargantuan , that nobody knows what to do or where to start doing it . Meanwhile , the Valdosta black bourgeoisie are becoming more and more comfortable , their world more and more secure . They are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dinner once a week to a previously " white only " restaurant , who can travel during their vacations and take advantage of the integrated motels , hotels , and travel facilities . Yet few of them have actually contributed to the Negro revolution that has made these things possible . The Valdosta black bourgeoisie are largely schoolteachers . Despite their new freedom , they must plod away in schoolrooms that are still separate and unequal ; they must keep quiet about integration or he fired . " I 'm doing all I can do and still keep my job , " " Black Bourgeoisie , " ? 1964 by the New York Chapter Congress of Racial B+ quality . one third-grade Negro teacher told me . " When my principal is n't around , I teach my children that four pickets times nine pickets is thirty-six pickets . I just hope and pray they grow up and get the message . " Part of the tragedy of my town is that there is no real Negro leadership to translate to the masses the message this teacher is trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten or twelve men with incomes rooted in the ghetto , who sporadically gather to try to muster general support for programs each of them has presented to the town 's white fathers when his fellow Negro spokesmen were not looking . A dozen of these Negro leaders ? most of whom I have known since childhood met with me to dis-cuss the plight of the Valdosta Negro and to describe what they planned to do about it . The more they talked the more it became apparent , as one of them had the courage to say , that Negro leadership was about the same as it . was when I was a little boy . There is no NAACP in Valdosta , no Urban League . Nobody would dare let Martin Luther King , Jr. , preach in their church , and CORE is something they read about in the newspaper and hear about on television . The Negro leaders , such as they are , turn on each other and accuse one another of being disloyal , apathetic , and indifferent . VII ViT hat , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward integration , but into the world as it really is ? Although the Negro population is 36 per cent , not a single public school is integrated in the town . However , the all-white board of education is ready to accept Negro pupils into any schools they can establish their legal right to attend . Moreover , the white power structure knows precisely where these schools are , and the white students have been prepared for the probability that their schools will one day be integrated , Even more , the white students have accepted the idea and wish the Negroes would get it over with so everybody concerned can settle down to learning his lessons . White Valdosta businessmen have jobs waiting for Negroes ; these jobs will never be filled until Negro leaders stop fighting each other and draw up a unified job program to place before the biracial commission . At a state college located in Valdosta , I was told , there were only two Negro students , and of the these were financed by some of the Negro leaders who met with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be changed if Negro spokesmen would unify and make the right demands . There is an integrated county technical and industrial school on the outskirts of Valdosta that is begging for Negro students . There are all too few Negro applicants . The brunt of the burden , I regret to say , rests with the town 's Negro middle class . But they , like so many of their white peers , are consumed by fear . The Valdosta Negro middle class , then , is on the verge of becoming a tribe ; its members are fiercely proud of themselves and their own ; they could n't care less about socializing with white people . At a large party given for me one night , I was able to locate only one Negro friend ? a woman ? who had a social relationship with a white person , She and a white woman have a " luncheon friendship , " largely at the urging of the white woman . Even that almost collapsed when the white woman invited other white women to join . " The other white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I was ready to say , like , forget it . My husband makes more than her husband and I was n't about to grovel just to have some white lunch dates . " " I know what you mean , " a county school principal said . " These phony white liberals are about a bitch . They say they love us , that they want to cement relations , that they want to overcome the fact that there has been no communication between us and them , and then they get in that damn voting booth and . . . " " Vote for Goldwater. " several people shouted . " You think you got problems , " a doctor broke in . " I was walking down Patterson Street a few weeks ago and a white man fell to the sidewalk with a heart attack right in front of me . I forgot he was white and tried to help him . A crowd gathered and became hostile because I was a Negro ! " " Did you go away and let him die ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. " the doctor replied , " I did the best I could for the sonofabitch and sent him off to the hospital . " Everyone , of course , laughed . The party music played , but there was surprisingly little drinking or dancing . I was home ; these were my brothers and sisters . They knew me and were glad to see me . We talked of the days when we were children , of our fathers and mothers and grandparents who pushed us so far along the way . We told the " in " jokes . Nobody mentioned white people ; nobody wanted or needed by Louis E. Lomax 159 them there . We would have stayed all night if it had not been Saturday . But at church the next morning one of the school principals was scheduled to sing a solo . One woman was to play the organ , another the piano . Another school principal was to handle the collection , and I was to deliver the sermon . VIII The next day I stood in the Macedonia Baptist Church pulpit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a century ; some of the people who sat in the congregation had known me before I knew myself . Tribal middle-class pride was running high . Just the Sunday before , Calvin King , one of my younger childhood schoolmates who went on to get his doctorate in mathematics , had been the guest preacher . Uncle James had listened with pride as Calvin told of his travels in the Holy Land , of his work in helping launch a new university in Nigeria . I told the congregation about my experiences in Africa , behind the Iron Curtain , and in American cities where racial troubles had erupted . White Christianity , I said . had become synonymous with white oppression all over the world , and the black Christians were about all Jesus had left . We were the only ones who could now go about preaching the words of Jesus without ' being suspected of questionable motives . My plea was that we black Christians become more militant . that we take a courageous stand for human rights , to clarify Christ 's name if for no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished there was a loud congregational " amen . " A few white people had come to the service , and one of them was crying . Uncle James issued the invitation for the unchurched to come up and join . But that was not the hour for sinners . Rather , I think , it was a time for the believers to reassess what they were in for . Change is coming . Having seen many of the troubled places of Africa , America , and the Caribbean , I know social dynamite when I see it . But Valdosta will make it peacefully into tomorrow , partly because the whites themselves are slowly changing , partly because the Negroes are not really pushing . Time nudges them both along . They ? the black and the white of my town ? are now looking across at each other in estrangement against the day when they might join in frank friendship .
