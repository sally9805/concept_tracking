The 1,500 experts in medical and related sciences who gathered last week in Manhattan 's Americana Hotel spent hours listening intently to highly technical discussions of sex chromosomes , enzyme systems and skeletal development . In the Imperial Ballroom , earphones provided simultaneous translation in three languages . It was the second international conference on congenital malformations sponsored by the National Foundation-March of Dimes . The world 's outstanding researchers were tackling an immense problem : one baby out of every 15 is born with some defect , be it physical , mental or chemical . In the U.S. alone , that means more than 250,000 victims each year . <P> Making Mosaics . At this deeply scientific confab on one of humanity 's most distressing problems , the unexpected heroine was a quiet Englishwoman who presented no paper and who is , of all things , editor of a semiannual Mouse News Letter . Since the first such conference in London three years ago , the most noteworthy progress in unraveling the mysteries of human heredity has been based on the work of Geneticist Mary F. Lyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil servant , Mary Lyon got a Ph.D . from Cambridge University , specializing in mouse genetics . She now works at the Radiobiological Research Unit at Harwell , 50 miles west of London . Dr. Lyon became intrigued by the fact that some mice-but only females , it seemed-showed up with Joseph 's coats of several colors . This could not happen under classical Mendelian laws of inheritance . <P> <P> Two years ago , Dr. Lyon proposed a revolutionary hypothesis . Every female mammal , whether mouse or woman , has two X ( female ) chromosomes , one each from father and mother . A male has one X and one Y. Since the X chromosome carries genes that control the production of many enzymes which in turn govern the body 's chemistry , a female with two Xs should have twice as much of these enzymes as a male with one . But she does n't . Dr. Lyon 's proffered explanation : one of the female 's X chromosomes is muted soon after conception and becomes a silent partner . It shows up thereafter only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But before it is muted , it starts the production of lines of cells that continue to live side by side with lines from the dominant X. So a female mammal is a " genetic mosaic . " <P> Some Sterile Cats . Building upon Miss Lyon 's theory , other researchers have explained a mystery about calico cats . In theory , such a cat has to be a female because its black and orange patches must result from two different X chromosomes . What seemed to be male calico cats have turned out , on study of their cells , to have two X chromosomes as well as a Y. They are an intersex form , and they are sterile . <P> Applying the Lyon hypothesis to women , geneticists at California 's City of Hope have shown mosaicism in women who suffer from a form of Mediterranean anemia . But this is only one of at least 58 inborn defects that appear to result from defects in X chromosomes . Among others : some forms of color blindness and of anemia , hemophilia , muscular dystrophy , deafness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conference is the hope of all geneticists that further exploration of her hypothesis will lead to better understanding of these crippling handicaps , and eventually , perhaps , to their prevention .
