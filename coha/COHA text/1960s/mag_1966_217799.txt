To Evariste Kassanda , 33-year-old chief of the Congo 's elite Police des Mines , nearly everyone and everything coming out of the diamond-rich Kasai province is suspect . In search of an estimated $20 million in diamonds a year smuggled out of the Congo , he and his men have found contraband gems hid den in elephant tusks , embedded in bars of soap , even pumped into the stomachs of small edible crocodiles on their way to market . <P> The smugglers ' tactic that Kassanda finds hardest to handle is the use of what he calls the " secret cavities " of the human body . Three weeks ago , he caught six smugglers - four men and two women - loaded with diamonds privately concealed . So it was that last week one John Wina was asked to bend over and submit to the routine check when he showed up in Kinshasa fresh from the mining country . The law 's probing finger produced six capsules of white diamonds . Kassanda 's cops some how felt they had missed a carat or two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and voila , as if by magic , there suddenly appeared 60 more plastic capsules containing no less than 1,500 carats of diamonds . <P> In order to halt the smuggling , the Congo government has put major mining areas under martial law and increased the fines and jail sentences on contraband gem carriers . Kassanda is urging even stronger measures . " If not , smugglers will continue the traffic using their secret cavities , " he says , " and all the fingers of the mines ' police will not be enough to block the smuggling of our diamonds .
