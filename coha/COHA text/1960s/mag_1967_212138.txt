To some listeners , Irish folk music suggests a vista of the Wee Folk prancing in a Donegal sunrise , described in the sad sweet tones of John McCormack . But Ireland is currently in the middle of a folk-music craze similar to the one that swept the U.S. in 1963 , and Macushla 's blue eyes would turn glassy at the sound of it all . The undisputed leaders of the revolution are The Dubliners , five bearded , brawling musical assailants whose style is just about as far removed from the McCormack idiom as Sgt. Pepper is from The Chocolate Soldier . <P> <P> Looking a little like 21 boxes of Smith Brothers cough drops , these sons of the Dublin working class offer a musical effect somewhat like Saturday night in a pub just before the police arrive . Bass Ronnie Drew , 33 , whose voice is like nothing so much as a bullfrog with a hangover , bestraddles the line with occasional forays a mile or so off pitch . Tenor Luke Kelly , 26 , gives out what might be the mating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 , Tin Whistler Ciaron Bourke , 32 , and Fiddler John Sheahan , 28 , round out the onslaught with glorious disregard for niceties such as time or tune . <P> Stoned . Audiences on both sides of the Irish Sea find The Dubliners ' pandemonium somehow endearing . Their record of Seven Drunken Nights , a woozy chronicle of just what its name implies , has passed the quarter-million sales mark , with Black Velvet Band just behind . Two weeks ago , a sellout crowd of 25,000 at Dublin 's National Stadium matched the group roar for roar , and last week The Dubliners headed an all-Irish bill at London 's hallowed Albert Hall . <P> <P> In repertory and insolence , The Dubliners resemble superficially the long-arrived Irish-American group , The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem , but the Clancys have slipped in Irish esteem because of what some observers feel is an increasing slickness . Whatever the sensitive ear may find wrong with The Dubliners ' current style , it has nothing to do with slickness or lack of authenticity . When the group raises the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lads are working from personal experience : they are lip-smacking veterans of the informal hooleys and singsongs at Paddy O'Donoghue 's in Merrion Row , the pub celebrated in J. P. Donleavy 's The Ginger Man . <P> No Laughing Matter . Most of The Dubliners ' arrangements are appropriately home-brewed from traditional materials that the boys have assimilated on their pub crawls . At its frequent best , their hard-edged raucousness restores even the most familiar ballads to the folk sources where they were spawned . A song like the traditional Weila Waile , which the Clancys turn into a laff riot , comes off in The Dubliners ' brawny hands as the grisly epic of infanticide that it actually is . The often sentimentalized Rising of the Moon becomes in the Dubliners ' ver sion a powerful , harrowing hymn of revolutionary heroism . <P> Following the current English tour , the group returns to home base for dance-hall engagements through Christmas . No American tour has been booked as yet , but that seems only a matter of time . So far , however , The Dubliners have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ambition of mine , " croaks Drew , " to be a part of a pop industry . I do n't want my individuality to be taken away by any success .
