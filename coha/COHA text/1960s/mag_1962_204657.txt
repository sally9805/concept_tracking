Occidental College is an oak-and-eucalyptus oasis of Italian Renaissance buildings dotting a green hillside on the northeastern fringe of hurly-burly Los Angeles . Its campus is small ( 120 acres ) , and- so is its coed student body ( 1,400 ) . When the Ford Foundation bestowed its massive manna on liberal arts colleges last month , " Oxy 's " $2,500,000 was the biggest Ford grant west of the Mississippi . Why ? <P> Among West Coast educators , the answer is simple . In a state long dominated by huge public colleges . Occidental has parlayed smallness. smart leadership and intellectual freedom into a warm , friendly spirit , first-rate teaching , and a taste for the experimental . Once considered to be a preserve for academically delicate youth from patrician Pasadena , Oxy has in fact long been especially strong in history , diplomacy and world affairs . It installed the first nuclear reactor ( in 1958 ) for undergraduate teaching in Southern California , has such high pre-med standards that graduates are virtually assured of acceptance in medical schools of their choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won two of the eleven Rhodes scholarships awarded in the West , plus ten Woodrow Wilson fellowships for prospective college teachers , the same number as giant U.C.L.A. Against stiffer competition this year , Oxy got four more Wilson fellowships and another Rhodes ( U.S. total : 32 ) . the seventh in its history . <P> By Western standards , Oxy is a venerable institution of learning . It was founded 75 years ago by Los Angeles ' Presbyterian ministers , who gave it a lavish land-grant endowment , and grandly called it " Occidental University . " After land values collapsed and enrollment plunged to twelve , Oxy became a " college . " It survived a disastrous fire , and by 1905 , the year when a poetic 18-year-old named Robinson Jeffers graduated , Oxy was solvent enough to dream of becoming " the Princeton of the West . " <P> That notion was scotched when women were admitted . But the goal of greatness persisted . Academic standards have been kept high : this year Oxy accepted fewer than half of its applicants , and it looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshman mean : 615 out of a possible 800 ) . More decisive were written essays and proof of intellectual curiosity . Instead of summer loafing , next fall 's incoming freshmen were busy last week perusing a list of prescribed books , from Edith Hamilton 's The Greek Way to Western Civilization and Calvin Hall 's A Primer of Freudian Psychology to William Golding 's Lord of the Flies . <P> Oxy now gets only half its students from Southern California , and it looks for the best without regard for class or race . This year 's senior president , for example , was a Negro . The result is a student body less feverishly cerebral than Reed 's , less sophisticated than Swarthmore 's , less social than Stanford's-but one marked by a pervasive sense of concern . <P> Effective Effulgence . Occidental 's boss is veteran ( since 1946 ) President Arthur G. Coons. 62. an Oxy alumnus ( ' 20 ) and a Penn-educated economist . A noted educational statesman , Coons was chairman of the committee that worked out California 's new " Master Plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life more perilous than ever for California 's private campuses , especially for those as small as Oxy.
