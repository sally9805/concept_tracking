When Britain 's Prince Philip and his daughter . Princess Anne , 12 , clambered out of their raspberry-pink royal plane at Frankfurt last week , there were no top hatted officials to welcome them or respectful crowds cheering " Es lebe hock ! " After greeting their waiting cousins , Prince Ludwig and Princess Margaret von Hessen , Philip and Anne got quickly into the rakish Alvis sports coupe , which had been flown ahead of the royal party from London . Then they headed down the Autobahn to Darmstadt , where they stayed at the Von null palatial 18th century Schloss Wolfsgarten . <P> The British visitors ' four-day stay made little stir in West Germany as a whole , but their presence worked like champagne on the aristocracy 's battered morale . In a society where most bluebloods feel that they are displaced personages ( there has n't been a Kaiser since 1918 ) , the Romantik of a royal visit is rare indeed . <P> <P> Thanks to the nation 's miraculous eco nomic boom . West Germans today are more concerned with paychecks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's economic and social transformation has failed notably to produce a unified , national Fuhrungsschicht ( leadership layer ) in place of the old aristocratic ruling caste . The result is a confused and confusing society in which , says Sociologist Ralf Dahrendorf , there is not one class of Prominenz but " a multitude of competing groups . " The " pyramids of power " include the church , the military , local government and such venerable universities as Tubingen , Gottingen and Heidelberg , where a Herr Professor commands undiminished respect from the community at large . <P> Salon from Ford ? By far the most powerful-and conspicuous-elite in present-day Germany is , of course , the Geld-aristokratie , the new industrial plutocracy whose yellow Mercedeses and Chris-Craft cruisers have largely replaced the Iron Cross and the dueling scar as status symbols . The new upper crust is personified by such tycoons as Rudolf August Oetker , who parlayed a baking powder business into a 100-company empire ; Hans Giinther Sohl , who as boss of Thyssen since war 's end has turned a family ironworks into West Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the nation 's biggest and boldest financiers . Yet , for all its wealth , says Sociologist Dahrendorf , the Geldaristokratie " is searching above itself in the social hierarchy for its behavioral standards . But the space above it is empty . " This , he suggests , accounts for the joyless , frantic materialism that characterizes much of postwar German life- " the medieval choir stall in the dining room , the conspicuous consumption , the complete lack of taste in art and literature . " Complains one sophisticated young princess : " If the Ford Foundation really wants to do something for Germany , it should endow a salon in Bonn . Just a little salon . The old society is dead now . "
