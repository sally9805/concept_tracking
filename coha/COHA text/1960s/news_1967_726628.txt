txt Letters to the Editor of The Times pg . 26 Letters to the Editor of The Times President 's Speech To the Editor : In his speech ? on Sept. 29 President Johnson gave a false impression that the nations of Asia and the Pacific support our war in Vietnam . They do not . The majority of governments in the region , which represent an overwhelming majority of its population , are conspicuously silent or opposed to the war . The President said he was " going to call the roll now of those who live in that part of the world , in the great arc of Asian and Pacific nations . . . . " His " roll " turned out to be Thailand , Malaysia , Singapore , the Philippines , Australia and New Zealand . He left out India , Pakistan and Japan , three of the most important and most populous Asian powers and all as near to Vletnam as Korea is . He skipped over the vast island nation of Indonesia but included Australia and New Zealand , neither of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from Vietnam as Greece is . He skipped over Cambodia and Laos , which border on Vietnam , to Thailand , which does not . He ignored Burma , Ceylon and Nepal , but cited the citystate of Singapore . The President did not call the roll he said he was calling . He carefully named only our client states and passed over the larger number who would embarrass him by being marked " Absent . " This letter is prompted by one published Oct. 7 from G.'G . Hencken which said " everyone must have been impressed by the comprehensive and magnificent speech . .. by President Johnson . " I was not , and neither were the majority of people I know . The rhetorical device of the roll-call struck us as craftily uncomprehensive and the Presidential assurance that no degree of " debate and dissent " could induce him to withdraw our troops struck us as high - handed rather than magnificent . KENNETT LOVE Princeton , N. J. , Oct. 7 , 1967 ? Renewed Teacher ' Strike ? To the Editor : The recent threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albert Shanker goes to jail is ironic indeed . What do you suppose they will do if , as certain of my clients who are members of the union are pressing me to do , I bring an action against Mr. Shanker and others in the nature of an action against officers and directors of a corporation for dissipation of its assets ? I assure you and them that Justice Nunez 's branding of the strike as illegal under the Taylor Act would dispose of all defenses to such an action and then the cost of the strike to the union will be borne by those really responsible for violating the law . Maybe the aforesaid stalwarts would help Mr. Shanker et al . to pay hack the $150,000 they wasted . Perhaps , also they might think twice next time about going out on strike in violation of law and might even contemplate with equanimity the idea of compulsory arbitra-. tion as the final answer to labor conflicts in the public area . JOSEPH LEWIS SIMON New York , Oct. 9 , 1967 bring demands for increases in pay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merry-go-round , with rising costs . " Your suggestion for bringing down expenditures in the pork barrel area is the right direction for balancing the budget . The mounting war expenditures , with no end in sight , would be another meaningful area for reductions . THEODORE R. KUPFERMAN Member of Congress Seventeenth District , Manhattan New York , Oct. 3 , 1967 ? Value of U.S. Space Program To the Editor : I find it very discouraging to read Harry Schwartz 's comments on space , the latest being his Oct. 2 editorial page column " Ten Years of SovietAmerican Space Rivalry . " Since he gores my ox , The Times reader can not expect to find objectivity in my reactions to his views . Nevertheless , I invite the reader to examine Mr. Schwartz 's main charge that " . . . the cost to both countries has been enormous , " and ' ask himself what the cost might have been if no rivalry had existed . If the Russians had not upgraded their entire nation and its technology with , the Sputnik launching on Oct. 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the United States to mount the lunar landing program . No United States lunar landing program would have meant the loss of far more than Mr. Schwartz seems willing to recognize . The modest scientific dividends which he credits the space program with producing are puny , indeed , compared to the effects space technology will certainly have on civilization in eons to come . Effect on Both Countries Technologically , both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. are enormously stimulated ? especially in computers , control systems , microelectronics , cryogenics , materials and structures , propulsion and power systems , data handling , systems planning , reliability and , above all , in trained engineers and scientists . As a result , both countries are better equipped to deal with the very problems that Mr. Schwartz implies we should have spent space money on ? urban renewal , poverty , environmental pollution and mass transportation . Politically , the space program has produced the first international treaty in history . Even Mr. Schwartz concedes the significance of this . Philosophically , the space program has made the world vividly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three billion passengers , traveling in a solar orbit , in a vast universe ? a humbling realization for any mortal . Everyone is for international cooperation , but two nations with ICBM 's aimed at each other have understandable problems working out cooperative programs . Even so , the United States has tried doggedly to initiate such programs with little success . However , in Belgrade recently , at the eighteenth International Aeronautical Congress , I and 700 other delegates from twenty-six nations heard a U.S.S.R. space leader call for a cooperative effort in lunar and planetary exploration . Perhaps the time for serious joint effort is coming . Mr. Schwartz will not be the only one happy about it when it comes . In the meantime , a peaceful program costing less than 1 per cent of the G.N.P. , which has produced new technology at a rate that only wars have equaled in the past ( but no longer ? the Vietnam war has produced very little new technology ) , should not be diminished because of serious domestic problems ? it should be focused on those problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Astronautics New York , Oct. 2 , 1967 ? Legal Aid for Poor To the Editor : I am deeply concerned about the manner of providing legal aid to the indigent of New York . Though legal aid programs are in operation in 43 states , regrettably New York City has not yet devised an acceptable comprehensive plan . Last November , when the Appellate Division rejected . the city-sponsored applications of several poverty groups as failing to adhere to state law and professional legal ethics , the court enunciated certain basic principles for law practice by charitable corporations as guidelines for revised resubmissions . The prospectus to the court is still too cumbersome and obtuse , and is otherwise objectionable . It aims to erect a complicated and overlapping institutionalized system for the practice of the law to operate under a superstructure entitled Community Action for Legal Services , Inc . ( CALS ) , through at least ten neighborhood law offices with provision for branches and extensions to serve in twenty-six designated poverty areas at an allocated cost of $3.4 million to the Fed eral Government .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
