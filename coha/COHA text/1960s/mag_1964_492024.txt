At present , residents are snarling at one another about zoning andwater rights . In the past they ha se wrangled user garbage disposal , advertising signs . telephone service and schools . The antagonists in these scraps call each other " liars . " " frauds " and " fascists , " hardly the kind of talk one expects in Eden . Last spring Big Sur 's battle for peace and tranquillity reached a peak when one citizen stabbed another . But no matter what the inhabitants do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a distance of 50 miles . beginning 25 miles south of Monterey and 150 miles south of San Francisco , the Santa Lucia Mountains roll straight to the sea . In some places they are gentle , green hills that turn gold in summer ; in others they arc steep cliffs plunging several hundred feet to the ocean Vicious storms lash the coast here in winter , and in summer , fog shrouds the area much of the time . But when the rain stops and the fog clears , one can behold the full glory of Big Sur  --  mountains , cliffs , canyons , redwood forests , small streams and the mighty Pacific  --  a combination of natural beauties perhaps unsurpassed anywhere in the United States . Big Sur first belonged to the tiny Esselen Indian tribe In the late 1700 's and early I800 's Spanish missionaries arrived to see what could be done about Christianizing the Indians . Finding that vet- ) little could he done , they went away , but not before gis ing the land its name ? " El Sur Grande , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I870 's , bad crops in the adjacent Salinas Valley drove some farm families across the Santa Lucia Range into Big Sur . A few descendants of these farmers still live in Big Sur , but they rarely become invoked in its spats . The spats involve two other groups  --  the artists Igenuine , pseudo and would-bet and the escapists  --  those who sought to flee from the panic of contemporary existence into the safety of the Big Sur hills and now are appalled to lind that life is in hot pursuit . For some years both groups have watched in horror as tourist traffic steadily increased along Highway I , bringing vs ith it motels , restaurants and other despised by-products of automobile travel . Big Sur citizens wailed and gnashed their teeth , but their despair was ineffective , for they lacked leadership . Then a Napoleon appeared , in thc person of sleek , pudgy Nathaniel Owings , a supersalesman and founding partner of the mass-production architecture firm of Skidmore , Owings &; Merrill . Owings had built a 5250,000 Big Sur retreat named " Wild Bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet above the ocean  --  and he had no intention of seeing his investment ruined by the commercialization of Big Sur . Owings 's wife Margaret had already experienced victory as a conservationist with a " Save the Sea Lions " campaign . Later she was to become equally concerned with saving Big Sur 's mountain lions . " And doubtless , if we had African lions , she would want to save them too , " says an unsympathetic neighbor . Now Margaret and Nat Owings set out to save Big Sur  --  and , of course , " Wild Bird . " Owings persuaded Monterey County 's Board of Supervisors to hire his firm as consultants . A squad of Skidmore , Owings &; Merrill experts produced a " master plan " designed to save Big Sur from the horrors of civilization by , among other things , regulating the number and type of houses that could be built . When public hearings on the master plan began before Monterey County officials , Owings was confident that approval would be swift . His hopes were shattered quickly , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan . Successful sculptor Emile Norman said later that he had opposed the plan because his mountain-lop retreat had been designated a park area without his consent . " I plan to give my land for a state park anyway , when I leave here or die , " said Norman , " hut I do n't want picnickers in my yard while I still live here . " Seventy-year-old George Harlan , whose family has lived at the southern end of Big Sur for three generations , said he was against the plan because it was a " dictator law . Under those ordinances , you 'd have had to go to somebody to get permits to do anythin ' . " Cortland Hill , a gentleman rancher and grandson of Great Northern Railroad founder James Hill , reportedly opposed the plan for the simple reason that he has the largest holding in Big Sur , about 6,000 acres , and wants no strictures on his future actions . Owings fell back under this heavy fire and settled for a weakened version , of the master plan , which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan 's passage as " a great step in the democratic process at the local level . " Privately , he was disappointed by the , compromise and astonished by the virulence of the opposition to his scheme . He need n't have been . Big Sur residents have rarely been able to agree on anything , and it is not surprising that even an attempt to preserve their prized isolation could not unite them . The typical Big Sur escapist does not have a telephone . Only 115 names arc listed in the Big Sur directory , and some of these are duplications . As a result , phone service is terrible . " We have an old electric switchboard , and it gets pretty psychotic during storms , " says sculptor and longtime resident Harry Dick Ross , " but I do n't think people would want to change it . " Emile Norman swore five years ago , " I will never have a telephone ! " Last year he installed one . " But I do n't always answer it , " he contends defensively . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for a long time nothing was done about it , " Everybody thought it was a fine idea , " says Harry Dick Ross , " but everybody also thought it should be on somebody else 's land . " The problem found a happy solution , however , when a San Francisco bus driver named Howard Welch decided to move to Big Sur . Welch arrived in Big Sur at the height of the garbage grumbling , in need of a job . He offered to haul the abominable waste all the way to the Monterey dump , and the job was his . Once Welch called for trash only when summoned by postcard , but he , too , has yielded to the telephone , Welch is also a writer . At present he is working on a novel he plans to call Rural Trash . " I 'm just trying to put this whole confused trash thing together , " he says , mystifyingly . Clearly , though , Howard Welch provides a perfect Big Sur solution to one typical Big Sur problem . The area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several years ago Big Sur 's few motel and restaurant owners wanted to place a sign at the northern border of the region to tell travelers where they might find food and shelter . Residents were aghast . A long argument followed , and the result was another triumphant compromise with the 20th century . A sign was erected , fashioned of redwood and bearing small notations like GLEN OAKS MOTEL 7 M. etched by knife . But the sign blends so well with the scenery that most tourists fail to see it at all , and those who do sec it can not read it . As a result , hundreds of harried and hungry tourists wander about Big Sur every summer evening , banging on the doors of irritated residents to ask for information about a place to Cut and sleep , All in all , the fight against Modern Times goes poorly in Big Sur and , partly as a result , the character of the place is changing gradually . Serious artists have lately been vastly outnumbered by artistic pretenders . There is a great deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant perched on the side of a hill that commands a spectacular view of southern Big Sur , was once an authentic artists ' refuge . " We used to go down there one or two weekends a month in summer , " a San Francisco painter recalls . " We did n't have much money , and neither did most of our friends in Big Sur , but we could sit on the deck at Nepenthe and talk and drink beer and stare at the sea all afternoon. - Not anymore . Now Nepenthe  --  the menu explains that the name " is derived from a Greek word meaning ' no sorrow ' ' " ? is a favorite with San Franciscans who spend weekends at fashionable Pebble Beach , near Monterey . Owner Bill Fassett protests , " I still would like to keep it a place for the guy Mu ) is painting or writing a book  --  the ' bearded one , ' if you will . " But he has driven away most of the bearded ones by installing a gateman and by charging $3.50 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere as a cheeseburger . This summer Nepenthe will make an even bigger pitch for the wealthy trade when it opens an " exotic coffeehouse " and gift shop . The gift shop promises to he pretty exotic too , for it will be man-aged by Miss Caryl Hill , a leggy , a t t rac-e blonde who is presently a Nepenthe hostess and , on the side , president of the Anangaranga Trading Co . " The name comes from the Hindu Vedas , " explained Miss Hill . - They have a book called the Kamasultv , which explains the 64 posi-tions for making love , and another called the ? ithuicuram , a , which discusses physi-cal lose in a broader sense . " Miss Hill pondered a moment . then continued . suppose you could say it 's all about making lose on a tiger skin . I 'm told it helps to generate a great deal of electricity- A tiger skin of ascrage size and electrical potential may be obtained from Miss Hill for about $400 , and she reports that business is brisk . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose special properties she does not divulge , and wolf-skin robes , which she suggests for young men with sports cars who ca n't afford a tiger skin . " Now that Nepenthe has a gateman ( and telephones ) , Big Sur has no gathering spot for its true artists . But pseudo-artists and hangers-on arc to be found in considerable numbers at Hot Springs Lodge , about 10 miles south of Nepenthe . Hot Springs has had a colorful history . According to its present managers , it formerly was a retrcal for beatniks drisen from San Francisco by police harassment and Gray Line bus tours ( TOUR NORTH BEACH  --  SLE AUTHENTIC BEATNIKS ! ) . Eric ( Big Daddy ) Nord , who once ran the busiest pad in North Beach , was convicted of transporting a 14-year-old girl to Hot Springs in 1958 . After Nord 's arrest  --  he was put on probation  --  Hot Springs began to attract a different crowd . Dennis Murphy , who wrote The Sergeant , a promising first novel , ran the place for a while . Now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is interested in hallucinogenic drugs . Murphy and his partner Dick Price conduct seminars on religious mysticism and drug-induced experiences . Uric recent gathering at Hot Springs , for instance , featured Zen expert Alan Watts and painter Jean Varda in - an inquiry into the nature of glory , of that particular quality of light which , in visionary experience , transfigures the everyday world into paradise ... " A bit of transfiguration of the more ordinary sort nearly took place at Hot Springs last April I. A young man named Jay Kipp , a sculptor once arrested  --  and placed on probation  --  for growing marijuana outside his humble pad , stabbed Dennis Murphy nine times with a pocket knife . At his trial for assault , Kipp contended that he had acted in self defense , and he was acquitted . Murphy , after his release from the hospital , announced that he was " fed up with Big Sur and its artists " and went to live in Salinas . Caryl Hill and her 5400 tiger skins and the drug cultists at Hot Springs are a fair measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emile Norman and poet Eric Barker still live there ; so do retired folk like William Chenery , former editor and publisher of Collier 's and William Colby , a West Coast attorney and conservationist ; and , of course , the old-time residents . But they live there increasingly at their peril . " The place has changed some , " says William Chenery , " and I 'm afraid not for the better . " Poet Eric Barker laments , " It 's not quite as nice as it used to be , Ins not sure why . " Emile Norman thinks he knows why : " I do n't know how much longer I 'll stay . Big Sur was a wonderful place when I first came here eleven years ago . In many ways it still is wonderful , but the people here are working hard at making a mess of IL "
