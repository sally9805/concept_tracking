txt Replacing broken windows , like these in Chicago 's Beethoven School , took some $800,000 from the city 's budget this year . Vandalism and normal repairs leave little in the $430 million school budget for badly needed construction of new classrooms . Turning $2 million into $50 million is a neat trick if you can do it . The Chicago Teachers Union ( AFL-CIO ) is pressing for the high figure in 1968 pay raises . The local school board and Superintendent James Redmond counter they can only spare $2 million . They say most of the expected $30 million hike in last year 's $430 million budget is needed just to meet existing expenses . Call it collective bargaining or a tug of war . It is a typical financial squeeze for today 's big city school systems . In Chicago the education fund ( mainstay of the school budget ) has doubled over the past 10 years . The 1967 budget , in effect until January , is an awesome 2,330 pages and weighs a full four pounds . Average of $611 per pupil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars do not begin to keep pace with needs . Last year Chicago spent an average of $611 per pupil ? about half the amount spent in suburban Syosset , N.Y. , where Mr. Redmond served as superintendent before his Chicago appointment , and three fourths the money spent in many Chicago suburbs and New York City . Unlike Boston and some other cities , the Chicago School Board does not plead with the City Council for every penny it gets . It prepares and is responsible for its own budget . But the Legislature keeps tight ceilings on its education and building fund tax rates ( the two largest of the six tax funds in its budget ) . Earlier this year school officials were able to ease their way out of a serious financial bind ( to avert a teacher strike they promised $20 million worth of raises and benefits ) by getting legislative per- mission to ask voters to raise the education fund tax rate by 15 cents . The referendum was a success . State aid to Chicago schools has long been slim . Although among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the bottom five in percentage help to local education budgets . Even a recent hike in state aid did not change the figures appreciably . Building record cited Chicago 's school building record is regarded as one of the best in the nation . No less than 278 structures or additions mostly at the elementary level have been built or acquired since 1951 , In that time Chicago 's elementary population has more than doubled . The city has been cited by Educational Facilities Laboratories for its enterprise in converting a grocery chain warehouse into a vocational school and adapting public housing space to classroom needs . " I do n't know of any other city that has had the rate of . enrollment growth that we 've had to provide for , " comments Edwin A. Lederer , associate superintendent in charge of operationg services . " We 've been putting out fires in the sense of overcrowding and population mobility . " He concedes that he thinks Chicago has reached the saturation point with the 900 portable classrooms it now has . Although he says school officials have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are credited with eliminating double school sessions in the early 1950 's ) , Dr. Lederer says they do present a problem in using up available play space on school grounds . Despite Chicago 's record , building needs are still termed great . Another 25,000 pupils are expected ' in the next five years . One hundred twenty-five schools now in use were built before 1900 . It is estimated that the // *School bells ring for funds as budgets shatter // average Chicago high school operates at 132 percent of its capacity . As usual , the problem is dollars . The building fund , intended to cover both repairs and construction , rarely rises above $30 million a year " With that amount of money , the fund ought to be used just for repairs , " says Robert Stickles , controller in school board offices . Dr. Lederer has estimated it would take $100 million just to bring lighting and wiring up to modern standards . School requests for electrical jobs in 1967 alone totaled $30 million . Some schools have been told they must wait as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more that vandalism siphons off , the less you have even for repairs , " says John Borling , director of the school board 's bureau of plant operation and maintenance . " Wear and tear is one thing , and destruction is another . We had to appropriate $800,000 in 1967 just for glass breakage due to vandals .. . . Is n't it a shame to think 1/30th of the building fund goes down the drain ? You could paint five schools or build a new structure for that . " Voters approve bond issues Understandably there is little left in the building fund after maintenance and repairs for construction  --  particularly for expensive high schools . Chicago voters have faithfully endorsed the more than half dozen bond issues put before them since the early 1950 's . The last ? for $25 million  --  was in November , 1966 . And the Legislature has authorized the board to seek $120 million more from voters . " We 've never had any close contests , although the margin of support has been declining , " warns Dr. Lederer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 to 1 . Last time it was more like 2 or 11/2 to 1 . " Chicago school officials leaned gratefully on S38 million in federal aid last year . Bulk of it was allotted under Title I of the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act for saturation programs and after-school remedial work in arithmetic , reading , and the like which it recently cut from four to three afternoons a week . ? Local officials worry not only about possible dollar cuts from Washington but about the fact that all their proposals may soon have to go through and be approved by the Illinois Department of Public Instruction . They feel the state tends to favor rural Illinois . Federal aid accounts for such a sizable chunk of local school business that it is a full time job for George Balling , assistant superintendent of Federal and State Relations for the Chicago Public Schools . His office is filled with the latest in legislative documents . Like representatives of other large city school systems , he often travels to Washington every other week just to call on Illinois congressmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he explains . " We call it ' legislative engineering . ' And I think it 's generally agreed in Washington that we 've had quite an impact . " He considers the federal selection of Chicago school proposals wise . " We may submit 35 proposals under Title I and they approve 29 . Then we devise new ones . They have to be detailed and well thought out , but volume does not count for much . I 've taken some thick proposals to Washington I was almost ashamed to carry ? creative or not creative , you could n't tell what they were all about . And those were the ones that had to be revised . The ideas were cut down . " One thing is sure . Chicago schools are taxing up to their legal limit and spending every penny they receive . The pressures are on ? from the teachers , from the builders , from the maintenance crew , from the curriculum experts . There are times during the year when " something has to give . " Fortunately for school officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in taxes last February . The money promised teachers in an 11th hour decision was secured . Without such outside help , cuts in spend- ing are almost impossible to make . Class size , once down to 30 and currently at 33 , is often a first target in economizing .
