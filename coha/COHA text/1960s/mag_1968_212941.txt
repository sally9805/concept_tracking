TIME is at heart a magazine of ideas expressed in words , but our editors pursue the right pictures with as much intensity as they use in their search for the best language . Simply stated , the purpose of the 70 or so black and white pictures that we usually run is to enhance the vitality and meaning of the stories . <P> To get these pictures , we maintain a Picture Research staff , whose dozen members mine the world each week in search of the singular picture which will best illuminate a story , whether the subject is king , clown or space capsule . The picture researchers-all of them women-have a hectic work week , since in most cases the question as to which picture will be most effective is not answerable until the story has taken shape . Thus the girls must mix the prophetic with the photographic , culling from many sources hundreds of pictures that may or may not satisfy fast-changing requirements of world events and the flow of new ideas out of editors ' offices . No small part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures at hand . <P> Each researcher is assigned to special areas of the magazine . The girls take part in story-planning conferences , gauging pictorial possibilities in meetings with the editors and writers , then call , cable , assign or personally go after the photos from which the editors make final selection . The procedure we use for getting color pictures is somewhat different but no less intense . While some black and white pictures come from TIME 'S own files , or those of sister publications , most are gathered specifically for the stories with which they appear . The researchers must know the best source for an existing picture and how to spot the right photographer in the right place for the right subject . They have a sharp eye for early-stage picture editing-a talent that , as anyone might guess , rose to a peak when they helped the editors select pictures of themselves for use on this page this week . <P> <P> With the approach of summer-and vacation time-all of our readers , and especially students , are urged to remember to send us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
