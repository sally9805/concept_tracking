JAMES STEWART On my next birthday , May twentieth , I will be fifty-three years old . So far I have made about sixty movies . When you have made that many movies and lived that long and been through a war and been nominated for an Oscar five times  --  one win and four misses  --  you have a lot to remember . Most easily recalled are two occasions in my life when the expected did n't happen . In one of these nonevents , I did n't win an Oscar for my acting in Anatomy of a Murder , although1 had been nominated for it . In the other , I did n't lead a strike of 1500 bombers over Brunswick , Germany , although I was in command of those bombers as they circled at an assembly point over England . Of course , I have memories of the past in which the expected did happen  --  and the unexpected too  --  but the trouble is in sorting them out . I might begin with the first night I appeared in a Broadway play called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was visited backstage by Josh Logan , the famous director . 1 remember asking him , " What am I going to do ? " And I remember Josh answering quite simply , " If I were you , I 'd shoot myself . " I remember , too , the first time I got to California . I moved in with Henry Fonda . We kept bachelor hall . His place was in Brentwood , not far from Greta Garbo 's home . Then , as now , Miss Garbo kept herself unavailable and invisible . There was a white fence eight feet high around her place , and that barrier annoyed us . Hank and I asked each other , " Who does she think she is , the queen of Sweden or something ? " We were going to get a glimpse of her even if we had to dig a tunnel from our place to hers . In fact , we started a tunnel , intending to pop up in Miss Garbo 's back yard and say , " Hi , honey ! " The digging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem such a hot idea the next morning . It was a long way to her house by daylight . Another memory that sticks with me is the time Lindbergh flew the Atlantic . He left Long Island early one morning in May , 1927 , on a nonstop solo flight to Paris . That night I was with my dad at our home in Indiana , Pennsylvania , tuning a radio to a heavyweight fight in New York . just before the main bout started the announcer said , " Right now , Charles A. Lindbergh is somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean . Let 's all stand up and give him a moment of silent prayer . " It was a moment of great emotion . All the thousands at that fight in New York stood with heads bowed . Far away in our small town , dad and I stood up too . Emotional tension of another kind grips me on nights when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is handing out awards . When I was nominated for an Oscar as 1940 's best male actor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing two films at once . Since I was working at night and was bushed most of the time , I did n't feel like attending the Academy-awards dinner . Anyway , I thought , all it means is that I 'll spend several hours quivering and then be disappointed . Su I decided to skip it . If I had n't won an Oscar the year before , for my work in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington , how could I expect to win one for The Philadelphia Story ? As I saw it , my performance as Mr. Smith deserved an Oscar more than my part in The Philadelphia Story . Although The Philadelphia Story was slick , smooth and entertaining , Mr. Smith had more guts . But a funny thing happened . Somebody who claimed to " know something " called me up and said , " You 'd better be there . " So I went to the Academy-awards dinner . That must have been before the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse was employed to count the votes and keep the results secret until award @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I won my Oscar for The Philadelphia Story as a form of deferred payment for my work in Mr. Smith . It could be true . I 've always thought that Bette Davis won an Oscar for jecebel because she should have won one for Of Human Bondage . Other oversights , I suspect , have been made up in this way . Last year , when my performance in Anatomy of a Murder won me a nomination , but no Oscar . my wife Gloria  --  we were married on August 9 , 1919 ? sat with me throughout the Academy-awards affair . Gloria says it was a grueling experience ; let her tell about it . " One of the protective devices the nominees use to soften the pangs of suspense is to crouch clown in their seats muttering to themselves , I ca n't win . I wo n't win . ' But last year Jimmy was quite honest with himself . He sat there saying , ' I just might win . In fact , if anybody else wins , I think I 'll boo him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to be hard for you to be a good sport if you lose He said , ' That 's right . I ca n't help thinking I 've got a chance . ' I had my hand on his arm , and it was like keeping in touch with a tuning fork . Thank heaven it was over quickly . As soon as Hugh Griffith won the supporting-actor award for his role as the sheik in Ben Hur , Jim and I knew it would be a Ben Hur sweep ; so when Charlton Heston won ' best actor ' it was n't much of a shock  --  by that time Ben Hur had swept the board . I do n't mean that Jim was n't disappointed , but I was more emotionally rocked than he was . " I felt that victory for Jim would have been appropriate , because that night came nearly twenty years after he 'd won his first Oscar . His work in Anatomy had won the New York Film Critics Award , and often , when an actor wins the Critics Award , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Film Critics Award for his work in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington , but that year he did n't win the Academy Award . On the other hand , he did n't win the Critics Award for his acting in The Philadelphia Story , but he did get an Oscar for it . " To Gloria 's version of events I 'll add a footnote . The night I did win an Oscar my dad called me long distance from his home in Indiana , Pennsylvania . " You 'd better send that trophy back to the store , " he said . Dad has a hardware store in Indiana , and my Oscar is there , displayed in a glass case that once held knives . There was a precedent for this exhibit . Dad has always had the notion that any rare , curious or noteworthy object connected with his family should be put on view in the Stewart Hardware Store , either in the window or in a display case . My oldest sister studied art at Carnegie Tech and won high praise from her teachers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bundle , she sent them home . Dad was so proud of her talent that he put the paintings in his store window . He wanted everybody to see them . When my sister 's work advanced , she began to paint from the nude , and of course she sent these canvases home too . Naked women ? Dad put them in his window , and hear they caused quite a stir . So when dad said he wanted my Oscar for his store , I sent it the next day , He 's still got it . Since then that ex-knife-display case has become crowded with mementos . Among other items it contains photographs of my sisters , a picture of Gloria and me when we were married and the medals I won in the war . I 'd almost forgotten that my Oscar was in the old knife case when I was nominated for another Oscar for my performance in It 's a I l'onderful Life after coming home from World War II . I lost out in the voting , and when I reached home after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was three A.M. The operator said the call was from Johnstown , Pennsylvania , a town about twenty-five miles from Indiana . The man at the other end identified himself as a Johnstown movie-theater owner . " About that Academy Award , " he began . " You did n't wits it , did you ? " " No , " I said bleakly , " I did n't . " There was a moment of silence . " I 've been wondering , " he said , " if l could borrow the one your dad has in his store . I 'll put it in my lobby with a sign that says , THIS IS THE WAY IT WOULD HAVE LOOKED IF HE HAD WON IT . But your dad told me I 'd better call you before I did that . " " O.K. , " I said wearily and hung up . Dad did lend it to him , and he did put it in his lobby with a placard worded the way he had suggested over the phone . In those days my most loyal fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my pictures came to Indiana , Pennsylvania , she always wrote me about it , but not until the film had finished playing there . First she sat through every show every day for three days . She never missed a showing , although it meant sitting through nine shows , She did n't write me at once because it was n't until the last day that she began to find out what the story was all about . Before that she just concentrated on looking at me . She felt that when she saw one of my movies we were having a visit . Not that my mother was Indiana 's champion movie-goer ; Jim Blair , an old friend of dad , saw every movie that came to town , not just the ones I was in . It was his theory that the only way he could be sure of seeing the good movies that came to town was to see them all . His scheme was plausible , but working it out took time . Nevertheless , Jim easily kept up with all the films that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . He met the challenge by seeing movies mornings and afternoons , as well as nights . Jim wore thick glasses , and his eyesight was so bad that he had to sit up front in the first or second row . He slipped away from us a few years ago , before wide screens became popular . If he had lived on , such things as Cinemascope would have made him miserable . Dad made a point of movie-going when a film of mine was in town , but all my shows seemed to make him drowsy . When he talked to me about one of , my pictures , I could always tell at which point he 'd gone to sleep . He gave himself away because his memory of the story line , starting out strongly , would suddenly falter . I have my own lapses of memory . One night not long ago 1 was talking to Hank Fonda , recalling a homemade movie we had put together . It was my recollection that 1 had played certain parts in it , and Hank had played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " I played all the parts . " He had played a Fuller Brush roan ringing a doorbell to see a maid ; he had played the maid who answered the door , It was a cute idea  --  at least the results were funny  --  but the point is that I was convinced I had played sonic of those parts myself , until Hank told me , " You 're crazy . " Like everyone , I am sometimes tempted by wishful thinking to embroider the facts . This failing overtook me in discussions of my part in a picture called The Nitwit , ' Storm , which I made before World War II , with Margaret Sullavan and Frank Morgan . The plot had to do with Nazi activii ies on the Tyrolean border between Germany and Austria . Frank was cast as Maggie 's father . Sonic of his sons became Nazis , others did n't . I held out against the Nazis and fell in love with Maggie . She was killed in the last reel , and I escaped into Austria from Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the release of that picture , one person after another came up to me and said , " I never knew you could ski like that , Jim . You certainly are many-sided . " I told them that I had n't done that skiing  --  that a tall , skinny fellow had doubled for me . I said , " Those shots were taken at Sun Valley . I just shuffled around on a couple of snow sets in the studio . " But admiration of my skiing continued . I even got fan letters about it . Months went by , and people were still coming up to me and saying , " That skiing you did was wonderful . I 'm so glad you did it yourself , instead of hiring somebody to do it for you . " After a while , I was replying , " Well , of course , I did n't do all of it myself . Another fellow did the really hard stuff . " Then there came a period when I told those who insisted that I was wonderful on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid , you know . It 's like swimming . You never quite forget it . " After a year and a half , 1 was still getting letters from skiing fans . By then 1 had become completely corrupt . " Of course , " I said , " if you want to make a role absolutely real and convincing , it 's best to do your stunts yourself . Hiring a stunt man spoils the illusion . " I console myself with the belief that everybody 's memory is fallible  --  except Gloria 's . There 's nothing tricky about my wife 's memory except the tricks it can play on me . She even remembers the first time we met . I ca n't recall this historic occasion , probably because my head was abuzz with Christmas eggnog . Everything seemed confused , although 1 seem to recall that I was very , very happy . It was my custom at Christmas to get together with my pals , Billy Grady , casting chief at M-G-M and Johnny Swope , a triple-threat producer , director , photographer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , one after another , and ring their doorbells . This usually meant that we were asked in to sample whatever was set out on the sideboard . Gloria tells me that she was sitting on the doorstep outside Keenan Wynn 's house getting a breath of air when we three hove in sight . In our earlier Christmas calls we must have met a torrent of grog , because Gloria says , " You were not the soberest three I ever laid eyes on . " But 1 do remember the second time I saw her . It was at Mike Romanoff 's restaurant . Gloria breezed in and breezed out with her two small sons . I remember her walk more than anything else  --  a distinctive walk , hard to describe , something to do with the way she holds herself . She has good clean lines too ; and if that sounds vague , think of a cup racer under Gloria G ' s beauty grows out of her char-full sail . lo acter . There 's not an affected bone in her body or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 761 alive , menially and physically , than anybody I know  --  her mind is a delight . She has a wit so quick its like a whip . I guess the word for her is " thoroughbred . " Occasionally I do a TV guest shot with her . She 's not a professional , but she sort of bubbles and usually steals the show . While it 's wonderful for her , she 's so gay and friendly that everybody else on the TV show likes her . So it 's a two-way deal . It amazes me how good she is . I really met her at a party given by Gary Cooper and his wife , Rocky . I was the extra man and was seated next to Gloria . She says that I did n't say anything all that evening . I do n't remember it that way , but she may be right . It 's true that I usually have little to say , but I did take her home that night , and we made a date to play golf . After that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at first she had quite a time getting me to buy her a meal and that she finally had to come right out and ask me . The way she tells it , I asked her to go to a preview of a picture called You G011a Stay Happy , and she put it up to me this way : " If we go to this movie , does that mean you 're going to feed me ? " If she says so , 1 guess she did . After that 1 must have loosened the rubber band around my wallet a little , for we saw each other practically every day for a year . Usually I took her to Dave Chasen 's restaurant to eat , because Grady and practically lived at Chasen 's . Looking back now , I guess 1 must have been pretty much of a slowpoke compared with present-day romancers . Gloria had been married before  --  her name was McLean  --  and she had two fine sons , Ron and Michael . All I had was a long history of bachelorhood and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we got back from our honeymoon . On our first morning at home I left for the studio without kissing my wife good-by . I did n't even say good-by . En route to the studio I got to thinking , There 's something a married man is supposed to do that I 've forgotten . I stopped at a pay station , called Gloria and said , " Good-by , dear . " Sometime later we were in England to make a picture . But Gloria did n't stay long ; I sent her home because she was pregnant . One night she telephoned me  --  eight P.M. California time ; four A.M. on my end . " 1 just found out , " she said , " we 're going to have twins . " I thought she was joking . " Go back to bed , " I said . " You 're dreaming . What else do you know ? " There was a moment of silence at the other end of the wire . Then it dawned on me , She 's not joking ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? " She said it was simple ; the doctor listens to heartbeats with a stethoscope , or something like that . I 'd never heard of such tests and I thought she was crazy to believe in twins . So far as we knew , there had never been twins in my family or hers . When I went to work the next morning , I did n't know what to believe . I told an English friend , " The damnedest thing happened last night . My wife called up and told me we 're going to have twins . " I thought he was unnaturally calm , even for an Englishman . In crisp , businesslike tones he said , " Have you dropped into Lloyd 's for twin insurance , old boy ? " I 'd never heard of twin insurance and I was so excited by Gloria 's phone call that his advice sounded coldly commercial . He insisted that when English people marry , most of them buy insurance against twins right away , but I was n't interested . Instead of figuring how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I concentrated on finishing the picture I was in and hurrying back to California . When I got home , I began to worry about finding the shortest route to the maternity hospital when Gloria 's time came . I made trial runs to the Cedars of Lebanon Hospital , where Gloria had a room booked . On my first dry run I timed myself with a stop watch , all very scientific , until I got lost and I had to ask at a gas station where I was . After that I made the dry run three times and mapped out a good route . As it turned out , when things did start with Gloria , there was no need for hurry . She was in the hospital a whole day before the twins were born . Then complications set in . I do n't like to think about it even now and I 'd better let Gloria tell the story . " When our twins arrived , I not only had a difficult delivery , I had three or four operations , and everybody thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last minute . After that I had a complication . I was in the hospital for a long time before they said I could go home . Jim was at the hospital to help move me and my luggage and all the flower pots I 'd accumulated . I was in a wheel chair when Jim said , ' All right , I 'll go down and get the car out of the garage and bring it around to the ambulance entrance . You go down in the elevator . I 'll meet you there . ' " 1 went down all right , but Jim forgot to pick me up . He just got into his car and went home . Twenty minutes passed , and the nurse asked , ' Where could he be ? ' Knowing the man , I said calmly , ' He 's forgotten . ' She protested , ' He could n't have forgotten ! ' I just said , ' Take me back upstairs . He 'll phone . ' We went back ; sure enough , the phone rang . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographer 's studio to pick up some pictures . The photographer asked , ' How is Mrs. Stewart ? ' Jimmy bleated in horrified tones , ' Mrs. Stewart ! ' Then he ran to the phone , called me and said , ' I 'll be right down . ' He had n't forgotten the babies , because by that time they 'd been home for a month  --  he 'd just forgotten me . If any producer needs an absentminded movie actor , he would do well to typecast Jim . " For years before I met him , I read in the papers that Jim was Hollywood 's most eligible bachelor . Nothing was said about his being absent-minded . I only knew him as I saw him on the screen , but I was one of his fans . My friends the Gary Coopers and the Henry Hathaways  --  he 's a director at Fox  --  kept telling me that I ought to meet Jim . ' You two will get along fine together . ' They knew him and liked him . " Rumors and gossip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't paid much attention . In fact , I still do n't know much about the affairs Jim had before we met , because he does n't talk . But I have heard , from someone else , one wonderful story about that period in his life . " It seems that a certain well-known , well-heeled bachelor girl fell in love with him . She showered little attentions on him , such as sending her chauffeur-driven automobile to take him to the studio in the morning . It 's my guess that by that time he 'd lost interest in the romance , for if he saw her approaching in another of her cars , he slid down to the floor of the auto he was in and hid from view . We still see that generous ex-girl friend of his now and then , and she says occasionally with arch significance , ' You and I have a lot in common , Gloria : She does n't quite dig me in the ribs with her elbow when she says it , but almost . " Whatever Jim was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one hun dred per cent family man now . I sometimes tell him , ' It would stir up interest in you among the gossip columnists if you 'd walk out on me for about two weeks . The freewheeling Jim , pursued and sometimes caught by lovely ladies , has been forgotten . To most people you 're just Mister Good Boy , the happiness lad . ' " The truth is , he is not always happy or glad . At times he 's moody and introspective , and it 's uphill work to get a word out of him . I can talk myself blue , and his thoughts are way out in left field . The kids will talk to him at the breakfast table , and he does n't hear them . He wo n't even say ' Uh-huh . ' " As for being absent-minded  --  well , he does try . He even writes reminders to himself on slips of paper and forgets to look at the slips . Or he 'll say , ' I 've got somebody coming to see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four o'clock , but Jimmy wo n't . If the ' somebody ' is a person I do n't know , we make conversation , perhaps for an hour or more , waiting for Jim to show up . " Sometimes he forgets a date with our best friends , the Kirk Johnsons , from Texas . But they are understanding and sympathetic . It 's a good thing they are , for Jim never carries enough money , and the Johnsons are always having to bail us out . He 's always diving into my handbag for coins . We 'll leave for Europe to spend six weeks or we 'll take off for India , and Jim will have about eighty dollars in cash and two hundred dollars in traveler 's checks to see us through . When we 're with the Johnsons , Fran Johnson pays all the restaurants and hotels and keeps an accounting . When we get home , Jim pays our half of the bills . I must say , its hard on a wife who 's trying to buy gift , overseas for friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with . " Last summer when we took our family to Europe , we did n't have the John-sons with us , so I latched onto all the credit cards I could . I figured that we could at least eat . I often wonder why Jim does n't take more traveler 's checks . He believes in them , but apparently only two hundred dollars ' worth of belief . " I spend quite a bit on clothes and accessories , otherwise I 'm pretty careful . Even so , Jim is far more careful than I am . He gives me three hundred dollars a month spending money for myself and our twin daughters . He has n't the slightest conception of how much it costs me just to have my hair done . Three hundred a month for everything I need , including my clothes , gets me nowhere , but I have n't the heart to tell him . Luckily I have some money of my own . When spend more than the three hundred he gives me , he does n't get the bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a dress that cost five hundred dollars , it never occurs to him that it cost that much . l never tell him what I spend , and he thinks I 'm doing fine . " Jim 's conservatism demonstrates itself in other ways too . I always leave the front door open , but Jim 's a great one for locking up at night . He not only locks up , he 's always trying the doors to make sure about them . I usually keep our driveway gates shut so our dog wo n't get out , but Jim closes the gates even when the dog is n't home . I suppose this habit of his was acquired during twenty-five years of stiff-arming people who were trying to invade his privacy , for Jim , like all movie stars , lives in a fish bowl . There are roadside stands where vendors sell maps to the stars ' homes . You buy a map , you board a sight-seeing bus , it conies past our house , the driver points it out to his passengers . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . She loved those February I buses and the people in them . When we looked out of a window , likely as not we 'd see her out front gossiping happily with the people in the buses and regaling them with personal titbits about the Stewarts , She 'd mint at one of our twins and say , ' This one 's named Kelly , although it 's an odd name for a girl . We 're having a little trouble with her bathroom training . ' We still have about eight or ten such visitations a day ; but the nurse is gone , so the buses do n't linger . " Of course , an actor ca n't hope for absolute privacy . A lot of publicity was given Jim 's promotion to a brigadier general in the Air Force Reserve , for example ; he got less publicity , but just as much satisfaction , from his election in 1959 to the Princeton University board of trustees . Jim 's father is very proud of his Princeton election . He feels that Jim 's success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really think he believes that Jim had much to do with that . But the fact that his son is a Princeton trustee means the world to him because he is an old Princetonian himself . " I do n't really think that Jimmy 's dad approves of me , but he ca n't find anything he really dislikes . According to Jim 's old friends , Billy Grady and Dave Chasen , Jim 's father was always saying , ' We 've got to get this fellow married . He needs a mate . ' But it was really Jimmy 's mother who wanted him to get married . Before her death , she used to visit us late in the fall , staying until Christmas drew near . Saying good-by to me , she would add , ' I do n't mind leaving Jimmy this time , because he wo n't be alone. ? Now that Gloria has signed off , I 'd like to go back to her remark that " 1 do n't really think Jim 's dad approves of me . " Dad needs someone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to play anybody 's straight man . She 's lightning-fast on the draw and sharp with her answers ; she has an alert mind . With these qualities she is unsuited for the job of feeding dad lines , the way a straight man is supposed to do . The result is that they often tangle . I suppose I have been subconsciously playing straight for dad all my life , but I 've loved him so much that l 've been happy to have it that way . My mother played straight for him , which meant letting him have all the best lines . Dad is eighty-seven , but he goes to work every day . I 'm sure the main reason he 's kept his hardware store going is that he wants to have it ready for me to come back to , if I ever need real work instead of what he regards as make-believe work . It 's his guess that sooner or later the smart people in California will get wise to me and decide that I 've been fooling them about what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's any sorrow involved in growing old , as long as a man is healthy and financially independent  --  and my dad is blessed with both of these advantages . But the terrible thing is that if you live long enough , you outlive all your friends . In dad 's case it 's even worse because he has such a young outlook . Younger people look upon him as an old man , but he does n't feel old . He has visited Florida a couple of times , but he does n't like it down there , " I do n't want to live there , " he says . " There 're only old people there . " It did no good to point out to him that most of those old people are n't as old as he is . Five or six years ago dad and his crony Jim Blair became joint owners of a trotting horse . Since they were both eighty , they conceded they might be a little too mature for racing , so they hired a " younger man " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a truck , and they had a picture of a horse painted on it . Althoughneither of them had any business driving a motor vehicle , dad and Jim Blair loaded their horse into the truck , hooked the sulky onto the back and drove the rig to one fair after another . Dad has a cataract in one eye , Jim Blair had trouble seeing across a room , and they drove mostly at night . I ca n't imagine how they survived , but for a while they had a ball . Then Jim died . Dad got rid of the horse . The driver moved away . Another piece of dad 's life was gone . Now he says , " I 'm going to make ninety . " One story about dad that I must tell goes back to my trip home from World War 11 , as one of 15,000 troops on the liner Queen Elizabeth . It was foggy when we came up the Hudson at seven o'clock in the morning . Little boats came out and bobbed from wave to wave on each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , JOE or HELLO , HARRY lettered on them . The people on the boats yelled , and the boys on the Elizabeth yelled back to them . Fog made the visibility bad , but as we got close to the Battery , the air cleared , and the yelling suddenly stopped . I looked around . The Statue of Liberty had come into view . It looked as if somebody had raised a dirty curtain and trained a spotlight on the big lady 's face . Then it became noisy again . Cab Calloway and his band were on the roof of the pier . My producer-agent friend , Leland Hayward , was at the bottom of the gangplank waiting for me . I remember a lot of guys calling , " So long , Jimmy ! " and I remember shouting good-by to them , strangers mostly . There were reporters on the dock , but Leland got me into a car and up to the St. Regis , where my father and mother were waiting . That afternoon I went through the mustering-out process and was put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania , with my family . My first day there was a busy one . Photographers taking pictures for magazines followed me around town . A sign on the courthouse said , WELCOME HOME , JIM , but most people welcomed me home in person . We had dinner with friends and relatives . Then , about nine o'clock , everybody left . Dad parked himself in his chair and said , " All right , Jim . What was it like ? " He really wanted to know about the war . I drew a deep breath and began . I said , " Well , we got over there . . . . " Then 1 looked at him . He was asleep .
