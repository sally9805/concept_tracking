It was like a tag-team fight . For two weeks on the fickle waters of Rhode Island Sound , the four best twelve-meter yachts in the U.S. had at each other in a series of two-boat races that went on through light winds and lashing gales . In not one of the dozen races did the sailors concede anything-except a generous serving of backwind . The only thing officially at stake was pride , but for pride 's sake , U.S. deepwater sailors put on a display of tenacity and tactics that had not been seen in a seadog 's age . <P> The boat that would defend the America 's Cup against Australia 's Gretel would not be picked until after next month 's final elimination trials . But in the first " observation " trials , two boats came out clear-cut favorites : Ted Hood 's buxom $300,000 Nefertiti , the glamour boat of the warmup trials , with ten wins and only two defeats ; and Weatherly , an also-ran in the 1958 cup trials , which finally found her speed with canny Skipper Bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even Nefertiti 's butter-fingered crew could not seem to slow her down . In one race they fumbled a spinnaker overboard in their haste to get it flying , still breezed to victory . Only against Weatherly ( seven wins , four losses ) did Nefertiti run into heavy going . Twice , by crushing margins of more than four minutes . Bus Mosbacher took the measure of the Marblehead newcomer . <P> The hard-luck boat of the trials was Paul V. Shield 's Columbia , the 1958 America 's Cup champion , which managed to win only four races , suffered a crowning indignity when her 90-ft. , extruded aluminum mast snapped during a race with Nefertiti , pitching two crewmen overboard and sending the heavy boom crashing down inches from the head of Designer Olin Stephens . But nobody counted Columbia out ; many of her losses were by a margin of seconds . Even hapless Easterner , which won only one race , was not ready to quit , with Olympic Champion George O'Day at the helm and a full set of new sails in the offing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank Packer 's Australian spies , hovering around the fleet each day in their chartered motorboat . This month Gretel arrives to start her own trial series against Vim , her chartered workhorse , and the Aussies could be sure that Hood , Mosbacher &; Co. would be around to observe the fun .
