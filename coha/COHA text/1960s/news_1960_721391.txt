txt The term " juvenile delinquency " should be eliminated in charging ' children with offenses against the law , a group studying the Children 's and Adolescent ? Courts recommended yesterday . The group found that ? the term , devised to protect children in trouble with the law , covered such a wide range of offenses that it had acquired a sinister meaning in general usage . . It urged the Legislature to authorize dropping the term and to " spell out more precisely the conduct or acts which would constitute violation of law . " The proposal was in the fifteenth interim report of the Juvenile Delinquency Evaluation Project of the City of New York , which was set up by Mayor Wagner . - The report-offered a broad program for closing the gap between the way the Children 's Court functions now and the way it should.function to rehabilitate children , the purpose for which it was set up . Discarding the " juvenile delinquency " label was one recommendation for closing the . gap . Others called for ' these things : I ** @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for " arrest " when taking a Child into custody . Providing a procedure whereby in deseuing cases a juvenile delinquency adjudication could be expunged from the record . fliteducing the court 's case , load through effective screening by the Children 's Court Bureau of Adjustment , which can settle cases out of court . CEncouraging justices to sub-1 stitute findings of neglect for petitions alleging delinquency , i when warranted . flEncouraging them to exercise more frequently their power to set aside their own find- ' tags of delinquency , in apprapriate situations . In its twenty-nine-page report , the project grotipheaded by Dr. Robert M. Maclver , Emeritus Lieber Professor of Political Philosophy and Sociology at Columbia University ? noted the creation in 1933 Of the Children 's Court . It reflected , the report said , " a new judicial concept " of a " socialized approach to children at odds with the law which recognizes their special needs and is primarily concerned with their rehabilitation , but which also seeks to protect the community and safeguard the legal // rights of both children and parents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing number of cases but " has exhibited some weaknesses , especially when its performance is measured against the social philosophy that led to the court 's stablishment , " the report said . In proposing the elimination of the " juvenile . delinquency " label , the report contended that " because of the newspaper publicity given to serious offenses committed by children under 16 , the term juvenile delinquent has taken on a secondary meaning generally associated with serious criminality . " " In the popular mind , " the report went on , " juvenile delinquent more often connotes a gang killer or auto thief than a child who is a truant or disobedient to his parents , " Since the term juvenile delinquency covers a wide range of acts of all degrees of seriousness , including some that if committed by adults would have no legal consequences at all , it appears desirable to eliminate the designation altogether . " 7 to 16 Age Limit Generally speaking , a juvenile delinquent in New York state is a. child over 7 and under 16 who violates the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child is adjudged delinquent by a court it is not a criminal conviction . A child under 7 can not under any circumstances be held legally responsible for his conduct . A child over 7 and under 15 can be adjudicated only a juvenile delinquent , even if his crime is murder . A child of 15 , however , can be tried in an adult criminal court for a crime punishable by death or life imprisonment , unless the judge recommends that the case go to Children 's Court . On Adolescent Court , which deals with juveniles over 16 , the report noted that judges in this court " sometimes are inclined toward severity in sentencing young offenders , particularly girls charged with sex delinquencies . " Commitment , the report continued , " should be used only where no alternative exists or where it is essential to ' the treatment process . " Another proposal was that the treatment of youthful offenders be expanded to include adolescents who were 19 or 20 at the time the crimes were committed .. Offender Term Possible The Youthful Offender Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not charged with a crime punishable by death or life imprisonment and has no previous felony conviction , he may be adjudged a youthful offender after an investigation . If the youth is so adjudged , the original criminal information or indictment is set aside and the youngster placed on probation or sent to an institution for an indefinite term up , to three years . The report also called for a single court for trial and dis- , position of all adolescent of-i fenders , and for simplification ; and consolidation of relevant statutes . " The multiplicity of courts ; and laws " is not only wasteful ; and inefficient , the report said , j but also has " frustrated the effective rehabilitation of adoles-j cent offenders . " The Juvenile Delinquencyi Evaluation Project was initiated ; several years ago by Mayor ; Wagner with the objective of ; obtaining an evaluation of city institutions and programs dealing with juvenile delinquency . Past interim reports have dealt with such aspects as probation and institutions .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
