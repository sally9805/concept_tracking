" Violence is not only that of pistols and fists ; that of the pen is more dangerous . " - Japan 's Premier Nobusuke Kishi <P> Against the screeches of Japan 's rioters last week came an imploring chorus that sounded almost like the voice of reason . <P> As paid demonstrators shed blood to keep Dwight Eisenhower out of Japan , seven of Tokyo 's most influential daily newspapers jointly denounced such goings-on . " We can not condone violence , " cried Tokyo 's Asahi Shinbun ( circ. 5,000,000 ) . " Impermissible under any circumstances , " echoed Yomiuri ( 3,500,000 ) . <P> Such sentiments were admirable-except for one thing . As much as any other agency , the Japanese press was responsible for the very violence that it now , all so suddenly , came to condemn . <P> For months , Japan 's newspapers willfully and methodically laid the groundwork for crisis with a steady vilification of Premier Nobusuke Kishi and raucous demands that President Eisenhower stay away from Japan . Last May , after Kishi pushed the new U.S. security treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the majority , " provocatively suggested that violence was the only appropriate response . As the street mobs took the cue , increasingly virulent headlines demanded Kishi 's resignation , concocted highly imaginative crises : PARTY LEADERS DESERT KISHI , and NATION 'S DIET SYSTEM IS STANDING AT CROSS ROADS OF LIFE OR DEATH . <P> Any Government . Such rabble-rousing irresponsibility is neither a studied reflection of the national will nor a momentary lapse from reason : it is the very nature of the Japanese press . With one minor exception-the Communist Party 's daily Akahata ( circ. 53,000 ) - the country 's 186 dailies stand for nothing at all . But they are united against the government . It just so happens that the Conservatives have been in power since the end of 1948 , but with fine impartiality , the press has flayed all of Premier Kishi 's predecessors as savagely as Kishi . Says one leading Tokyo editor : " We would similarly attack any government , including a Socialist one ; it is the duty of the press to be anti-government . " <P> Ironically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Mainichi 's Chikao Honda , Yomiuri 's Matsutaro Shoriki , and Asahi 's Nagataka Murayama , who secretly sympathize with Kishi and the Conservative cause . But they are journalistic eunuchs , interested mainly in profit , who have literally surrendered their papers to the hundreds of young liberal " intellectuals " in Japanese newsrooms . Espousing no cause but that of full-throated antagonism to the party in power , these leftists not only incite to riot but often themselves join the rioters . Last week , when a part of the mob broke off to charge police guarding the Diet building , the sortie was led by a phalanx of screaming , pole-waving newsmen . <P> The People Listened . Under the constitution pressed through by Occupation Commander Douglas MacArthur at the end of World War II , the Japanese were guaranteed freedom of the press . But to the Japanese press , freedom soon became a mandate to inveigh against all authority . Says Takeshi Susuki , managing editor of Chubu Nippon : " The function of the press in Japan has always been , and remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
