The prospects of the monaural LP are as bright today as the presidential ambitions of Harold Stassen . Some record companies have stopped making them , and the rest may well soon follow suit . <P> <P> Thus LP collectors are faced with the imminent disappearance of many fine mono recordings made between 1948 , when the LP was first introduced , and 1958 , when stereo was born . Some items may appear again on reissue lines , such as Angel 's Great Recordings of the Century . But most will not . Nor does electronic rechanneling of the old recording into stereo solve the problem . " To put it bluntly , electronic stereo is presently nothing but sonic vandalism , a fact recognized and even privately admitted by the record companies themselves , " says High Fidelity magazine. * Thus wise collectors are buying up the choice items still available . Among them : <P> WALTER GIESEKING ( Columbia ML 4536/37/38/39 ) . Superlative readings of the Mozart Piano Concerto No. 23 and Franck Symphonic Variations , plus assorted works of Debussy . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 1 Puritani and Puccini 's Tosca : the Greek-American soprano in her prime . <P> DINU LIPATTI ( Angel 3556 ) . Last Recital-Chopin , Bach and Schubert played by the great Rumanian pianist who died at 33 in 1950 . <P> <P> VIRGIL THOMSON : Four Saints in Three Acts ( RCA Victor LM 2756 ) . The Thomson-Gertrude Stein masterpiece of sophistication and naivete , recorded under the composer 's direction in 1947 . <P> SCHOENBERG : Four String Quartets ( Columbia ML 4735/36/37 ) . Incomparable performances by the Juilliard String Quartet . <P> WEBERN : Complete Works ( Columbia K4L-232 ) .

An unmatched rendering by Conductor Bruno Walter and Contralto Kathleen Ferrier . <P> <P> WEILL : The Rise and Fall of the City Mahagonny ( Columbia K3L-243 ) .

Still the best recorded Tristan ever , with Conductor Wilhelm Furtwangler and Soprano Kirsten Flagstad . <P> SCHUBERT : String Quartets Nos. 13 , 14 and 15 ( Columbia ML 4831/2/3 ) ; HAYDN : Six Quartets , Op. 76 ( Columbia ML 4922/3/4 ) . Masterpieces of chamber music performed by the elegant Budapest Quartet . <P> <P> *The most common method of rechanneling is to break down the original single track into a left track that emphasizes high frequencies and a right track that emphasizes the lows , then add reverberation . Electronic filters are used for the first operation , echo chambers for the second . The assumption is that most orchestras have the high instruments on the left and the deeper ones on the right , and that the left-right rechanneling will thus accomplish a sense of directionality , spread and depth . Of course , some orchestras are not arranged that way . Worse , the bass line is often muddied in the filtering and echo processes .                  @ @ @
