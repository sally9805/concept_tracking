ALL FALL DOWN ( 272 pp. ) - James Leo Herlihy-Dutton ( $3.95 ) . <P> For some adolescent reason that The Catcher in the Rye 's Holden Caulfield would have understood , Clint Williams ponders suicide . " Of course , if I end up in some lousy place like Hell , " he reflects in his diary , " it would be a miserable mistake . The thing I am gambling on is that after death people become automatically ghosts , and possess thereby complete freedom of movement . ADVANTAGES : I could follow Berry-berry around from place to place . " <P> Both Clint-who decides against becoming a ghost , after all-and his roving older brother , Berry-berry , are members of the Williams family , as splendid a set of oddballs as has appeared in U.S. writing since J. D. Salinger 's more eccentric creations . Clinton , who is 14 as the story opens , has just skipped school for 57 consecutive days . He sits around at the Aloha Sweet Shop writing compulsively in his notebooks whatever he sees and hears . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and whatever interests him in the family mail that he opens . During the last month he has filled 25 notebooks , excerpts from which make up some of the most revealing as well as some of the novel 's very few boring pages . <P> It is Brother Berry-berry who holds the key to the family 's happiness as well as to their despair . Tall , handsome , irresistible to women , brutal and meanly selfish , he bums around the country , calling home only when he needs money . His bemused mother adores him , pathetically unaware that he hates her . His father , a rude , free-thinking eccentric of a kind increasingly rare in the U.S. , insists that the boy is only sampling life and will turn out well . When Berry-berry unexpectedly shows up at home , the Williamses have a brief interlude of unaccustomed happiness . He falls in love with a nice girl , and even though he is coolly running a brothel in a nearby town , it seems that he is about to go straight at any moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Williamses . Clinton finds almost nothing worth putting into his notebooks , since happiness is so dull , but it affects and even excites him too . <P> But the rot in Berry-berry runs too deep . When his girl becomes pregnant , he clears out and hits the road again , carelessly denying blame for the tragedy that follows . Yet the short vacation he took from his inner evil created something of value . Having tasted the richness of family love , Clint and his parents are not likely to turn away from it again . <P> The message of All Fall Down , the universal need for love , is as obvious as it is worthy ; the means of getting it across makes unfailingly good reading . Author Herlihy ( Blue Denim , The Sleep of Baby Filbertson ) plays with a kind of hurt tenderness over every desperate human confrontation . With originality , freshness and economy he can convey the seediness of a brothel , a strip joint , a hotel room-never once trying for the sensational or playing up the shoddy for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types , he makes it effectively plain in the end that what makes them important is not their oddness but their kinship to humanity .
