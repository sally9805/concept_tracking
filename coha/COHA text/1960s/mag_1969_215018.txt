Hefty U.S. marshals guarded the entrances to Chicago 's Federal Building , searching every package carried in and jostling anyone who did not move quickly enough toward the elevators . Other officers patrolled the aisles on the 23rd-floor courtroom . The black defendant sat chained to his chair by leg irons and handcuffs , emitting muffled obscenities toward the bench through a gag of muslin and tape . The jack-in-the-box jury scurried in and out of the chamber at the judge 's direction , as outburst after outburst turned the proceedings into a bitter farce . <P> Dr. Benjamin Spock dropped by , but District Court Judge Julius Hoffman declined an invitation to meet him . " My children have grown , " deadpanned Hoffman . Sometimes part of the gallery was packed with Black Panthers shouting " Right on ! " in support of their gagged , chained chief , Bobby Scale . When the Panthers left , their places were promptly taken by silent old men wearing tiny paper American flags in their lapels . <P> None Rise . Despite the nightmare setting , this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , the deadly serious trial of eight radicals charged with conspiring to incite the riots that occurred during the Democratic Convention in Chicago last year . Convinced that they will be convicted , the defendants deliberately defied normal courtroom etiquette . All refused on at least one occasion to rise when Hoffman left the court , and several addressed the court at will . They claim not to be looking beyond the present trial , but much of their high jinks seems aimed at laying the basis for future appeals or having a mistrial declared . Their tactics are identical to those used on the streets during the convention riots ; they seek to provoke Hoffman in the same way that demonstrators baited Chicago police into overreaction . <P> Ringleader in the disruptions was Defendant Seale . Since the trial began six weeks ago , he has consistently demanded his right to cross-examine witnesses . He contends that he is without legal counsel because his preferred attorney is recovering from an operation . Hoffman argued that Seale is adequately represented by William Kunstler , a lawyer for the other seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The dispute has led to repeated attempts by Seale to address the court and Government witnesses . He has hurled such epithets as " pig , " " racist " and " fascist " at Judge Hoffman . At one point , the judge said : " I admonish you , sir , that you have a lot of contemptuous conduct . " Seale rejoined : " Let me admonish you for being in contempt of the people 's constitutional rights . " Hoff man then warned Seale that the court had the authority to chain and gag him . " Gagged ! " Seale replied . " I 'm already railroaded . " Finally , at midweek , Hoffman had had enough and ordered Seale restrained with handcuffs , leg irons and a gag .
