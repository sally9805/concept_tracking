From the cradle to the grave , about half , of mankind is never free from hunger . Tens of thousands- die of starvation and deficiency diseases every single day . We have heard this so often that ' the enormity of it leaves us unmoved . We also know that even if something is done right away to retard the population growth , rate ( and obviously nothing is going to be done very soon ) , before the end of the century the population of the world will have doubled ? there will be another three billion mouths to feed . Long before ' that time the chances are that the pressure of deprivation and desperation will have brought on another kind of explosion . The problem will , have been solved , in a manner ' of speaking , by the elimination of all or a large part of the human species . Why is there so much misery on a planet that could be a paradise ? The multiplicity of answers covers the whole spectrum of human behavior and misbehavior  --  political , biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single physical fact ? not enough fresh water where it is needed . About 9 per cent of the earth 's land surface is cultivated ; 36 per cent is cultivated but arid . Men are available , machine ' s might be , but water is not . Given low-cost water , the world 's food supply could potentially be quadrupled on the basis of area alone . Let it riot be siipposed , however , that water scarcity is confined to December 26 , 1963 the underdeveloped two-thirds of the world , where the benighted natives engender more offspring than can be fed with the means at hand . When Los Angeles obtained its first major upland water supply in the Owens River Valley , a civil war was fought between the Valley ranchers and the city , with recurrent dynamitings of the aqueduct . That was in the 1920s , but the war goes on ' still , minus the dynamiting but on a larger scale : between Arizona and California ; between , the two Californias , one north of the Tehachapi , the other south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water scarcity peculiar to the arid and semi-arid areas of the South- , west , where the metropolitan sections are nothing but reclaimed desert . The motel proprietor in Texas may have to go down 1,800 feet for water , with unconscionable drilling and pumping costs , and always , the specter of further lowering of the water table . Despite proximity to the Great Lakes ; some sections of the Middle West are said to be heading for a water shortage . Even the Northeast , where water is usually so plentiful that something like a third of it is wasted down the sewer , had an acute problem in 1948 , and has another one now that will probably , last into 1965 . The late President Kennedy was not exaggerating when he described water shortage as a national problem of the greatest urgency . In the Southwestern struggle fur water the thirty-year , five-state Pacific - Southwest Water Plan , proposed by ' Secretary of the Interior Stewart L. Udall , has been characterized by California 's Attorney General Stanley Mosk as a plan " to make Northern California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without adequate compensating - benefits . " Stung by California 's setback in litigation with Arizona over ColOrado River water , Mr. Mosk wants Northern California to be the Waterhole for Southern California via the Feather River Plan , which involves construction of a system with a 500-mile aqueduct at a cost of some $2 billion . But the end is not yet-According to Department of the Interior figures , the Southwest ' will need 60 million acre-feet. ( almost 20 trillion gallons ) per year of new water by the year 2000 . ' A large part of this impressive amount Will be needed by Southern California . When Lotusland outgrows the Feather River system , rivers , neat the Oregon border will presumably be tapped . Skeptical , like Mr. Mosk , of the Udall plan , Samuel B. Nelson , general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power , ' advises Arizona to try to get water from the Snake River in Idaho right now . The Southwest will be after water from Canada at this rate . The farther you go , , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been de ' 451. feated by fuel Costs , The Pacific Ocean laps Los Angeles and , San Diego , and Phoenix is not too far from the Gulf of California , but current desalination processes make sea water about twenty times as expensive as the price charged for Colorado River water . Small quantities of desalted Pacific Ocean water are being fed into the San Diego system from a plant operated by the Interior Department 's Office of Saline Water at Point Loma . The 1.4 million gallons of distilled water which this plant can produce daily sounds like a lot but is actually very little : San Diego consumes 80 million gallons a day . The cost of water from the Point Loma plant is about $1.50 per 1,000 gallons . It is not that the plant is inefficient , but that the cost of the heat energy required for distillation is high . The situation is the same abroad . Large-scale distillation of sea water has been dreamed of for centuries ? for reclamation of the Sahara Desert , for instance . The cost of energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the use of atomic power , the prize is within reach . Only , as big businessmen like to say , one must think big . Justice Holmes said that to think great thoughts one must have a heroic mind , and indeed considerable courage is required to think of nuclear power on the scale required . The particular solution I shall describe is the work of Dr. R. Philip Hammond of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory . Dr. Hammond is a forty-seven-year-old chemical engineer . He was a nuclear ? engineer at Los Alamos , primarily a weapons center . When his ideas came to the attention of Dr , Alvin M. Weinberg , director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and one of the country 's leading scientists , he borrowed Dr. Hammond from Los Alamos and set him up at Oak Ridge as head of the Saline Water Conversion Reactor Program . The studies are carried on by a small group of physicist-engineers under the auspices of ORNL and Union Carbide Nuclear Company , which operates the laboratory for the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission . Hammond reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( coal , oil , natural gas ) only when energy is generated in very large blocks . The jump is one that , startles even the engineer familiar with the largest existing power plants and systems . Grand Coulee , which holds all records for production of electric energy over a period of time , has a capacity of slightly under 2 million kilowatts , or 2,000 megawatts ( mw ) . The Soviet Union has a hydroelectric plant at Bratsk , Siberia , on the Angara River , which is supposed to have a capacity of 4,500 mw farm ( power always available ) . The Consolidated Edison system , which supplies all of New York City and most of Westchester , can generate 6,000 mw with every available unit rolling . TVA has a generating capacity of some 12,700 mw , both hydro , and coal-fired , in fifty-six plants , the largest of which is rated at 1,440 mw . Hammond envisions single nuclear plants up to 8,000 mw , or about two-thirds the capacity of the entire TVA system . ( All the above are reckoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant , is about a third of heat delivered to the turbines . ( Thus an 8,000 ' mw plant , electrical , would be rated at 25,000 thermal , ) Speculation extends to even larger plants . The economics of the big atom is similar ' to experience in other enterprises , such as chemicals , aluminum , etc . A few items are " scale-sensitive , " others are not . A plant will burn fuel , whether uranium or coal , pretty much in proportion to the energy it produces : this is an example of a component not radically affected by scale , once the design has been set . On the other hand , f the cost of manufacture of nuclear fuel elements , the reclamation of spent fuel , the engineering and construction of the plant , the instrumentation , shielding and other safety features  --  none of these goes up in proportion to size . The bigger you make the plant , the less each megawatt of capacity will cost and the more efficient the operation will be . For producing electricity alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 8,000 mw electrical , are out of the question at present . If a power station of ordinary size  --  a few hundred or at most a couple of thousand megawatts  --  should suffer a sudden failure , the other plants in the system would take over the load . , Electrical eggs can not all be put in one basket ; besides , there are few localities that can use such huge blocks of powdr . There must be another outlet for the heat energy drawn from the reactors . The Oak Ridge program is to study dual-purpose nuclear plants which would wholesale both electricity and distilled water , the distillation being carried on by the low-pressure exhaust steam from the turbines ( mostly heat that is useless for power generation ) . It is estimated that usable water could ' be produced in this way at the rate of 1 billion gallons per day for 15c or less per 1,000 gallons . One can begin to irrigate at this price and save heavily on municipal use : cities distribute water at 30-80c per thousand gallons , in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designing the reactors to breed plutonium . With fast breeder reactors , which are in an early stage of development , under favorable conditions water costs might fall as low as Sc per thousand gallons . In the Snowy Mountain scheme of Australia , the electricity pays for the water , which is distributed free . Substantial savings in residential and industrial heating would ' be a by-product of large dual-purpose plants , since low-cost electricity would compete with price-fixed oil and gas . Any section of the country in which such plants were located would become a low power-cost area , In such an area , as exemplified by the TVA region , practically everyone heats with electricity . Low-cost electricity also means low-cost fertilizer . The original purpose of the Muscle Shoals plant , the nucleus of TVA , was to produce nitrates for the manufacture of explosives in World War I ; later the nitrates were to be used in the manufacture of fertilizer . Fertilizer plus water is the formula for increased agricultural output . Other chemical and manufacturing processes would also benefit . One envisions great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All these benefits are within reach . In five years a prototype reactor of intermediate size , say 3,500 mw thermal , could be built ; in another five years , a plant of 25,000 mw thermal , and so on up . The cost of the big plant would be about a billion dollars , of which a third would be for water , two-thirds for power this two-thirds being divided between heat for the water section and for the turbines to generate electricity . Such a plant would operate with three reactors , each about twice as large as the ones used for production of fissionable material for weapons at Savannah River and Hanford . No " breakthroughs " are needed in distillation , nuclear power or electrical generating technology . All that the development calls for is an extension of present practice . Difficulties must be expected in any ambitious program of innovation , but the nuclear water-electricity project is in contrast to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 's unsupportable claim that the moon project falls within the state of the art . There is no question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefits will be realized here on earth , to fill vital human needs . Large-scale nuclear energy has revolutionary political implications . In the November 16 Nation , Jerome Ellison ( " Our Quaint Political Folkways " ) pointed out that the only kind of change that is stubbornly resisted is the political . Under present circumstances , there is no chance of any of Mr. Ellison 's proposals getting a fair hearing , much less being put in practice . Socioeconomic adjustment lags behind the atom even farther than it lagged behind pre-atomic technology . But perhaps , at what may be the last opportunity , politics will manage to catch up with technology after all , or at least speed up enough to avert catastrophe . Alvin Weinberg cites John von Neumann 's observation ( Fortune , June , 1955 , " Can We Survive Technology ? " ) that modern science and technology have become so big that in many cases they have rendered our geographical and political units , fragmented by what Veblen called " use and wont , " obsolete or worse . Weinberg emphasizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsolete by the march of military technology , but also our economic organizations are being rendered obsolete by the march of civilian technology ; and that , hopefully , our science as well ' as our technology are driving the world toward an unaccustomed unity . " December 23 , 1963 The scale of the proposed nuclear plants is too large to be accommodated by existing economic organizations and institutions , yet the potential benefits are enormous . Typically , society does not adapt its habits and institutions to a new technology massif until adjustment , becomes a matter of life and death for a sizable proportion of the population , and involves qualms of conscience , as well as danger to life and ' property , for the more fortunate . We now find ourselves in such a situation . It is quite plain that birth control , revolutionary socioeconomic changes and large-scale application of nuclear energy will all be needed to avert global disaster within the lifetime ( if indeed they live ) of today 's school children . Whatever we do , risk is involved . The risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in my opinion , if we grasp the nettle and , ' by adopting the great technology , force ourselves to learn to live with it . Just as it makes the traditional polity obsolete , modern technology makes obsolete some of the lesser conflicts that distract us from the serious issues . The contention between public and private power interests may be resolved more readily in an age of power plenty than when , by comparison , power was scarce . Public and private power can coexist as long as both are surpassingly efficient ; provided , also , that savings are passed on to the consuming public which , through the AEC , has subsidized the atomic power industry to the tune of about $1 3 billion to date , and proposes to contribute at least another $2 billion during the next decade . Reduction of 1 mill in power cost will save nearly $1 billion yearly in power costs now , and ten times as much in a decade . A pattern for the fu-453 tune . may be discerned in the joint operation by the Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the U-shaped power plant below Hoover Dam . Together they are amortizing the dam , the reservoir and the machinery . One generates and amortizes on the west side of the U , the other on the east side . The difference is hardly more important than whether the dam should be called Boulder . or , Hoover ? a question which had symbolic importance in the thirties , And Hoover Dam is a modest project - compared with the proposed nuclear plants . Strangely , at this juncture , David E. Lilienthal comes out against nuclear power in general in Change , Hope and the Bomb ( ' Princeton University Press ) and in lectures and magazine articles . We owe Mr. Lilienthal a great deal , and to quarrel with him is reminiscent of the story in which the would-be borrower reminds his friend . of the boons he had conferred on him in the past , only to be asked , " But what have you done for me lately ? " The factis , just the same , that in the nuclear line Mr. Lilienthal has dime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be aware of the developments at Oak Ridge ; at any rate there is no mention of them in the book . When , however , he argues against the " peaceful atom " on the ground of potential hazards to life and health , he must be , shown to be wrong- or the projects cease to be attractive . The risks , both in large-scale application and in the present range up to 1,000 mw , will be discussed in a forthcoming article .
