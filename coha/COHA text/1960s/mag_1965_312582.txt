Shortly after sticking up a Brooklyn hotel in 1960 , Nathan Jackson fatally shot a pursuing policeman . Shot twice himself , Jackson got to a hospital . There , say detectives , he admitted : " I shot the colored cop . I got the drop on him . " At his trial , however , Jackson testified that he had been drugged , refused water , and was in such pain that he could not remember what he said . <P> <P> Had the confession clearly been coerced , the trial judge would have ruled it inadmissible . But the facts were in dispute . Consistent with New York practice , the judge submitted the issue to the jury along with the question of Jackson 's guilt or innocence . If you find the confession involuntary , the judge told the jurors , " exclude it from the case . Do not consider it at all . " The verdict : guilty of first-degree murder . <P> True Yet Tainted . But what had the jury decided about the confession ? The verdict did not say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confession was coerced , did they then disregard it ? To Jackson 's lawyers , the unanswered questions suggested a solid case of violated due process . Coerced confessions , however true , have been outlawed as evidence by the Supreme Court since the early 1920s . The court holds that only voluntary confessions are trustworthy ; it believes , said Justice Felix Frankfurter , that " society carries the burden of proving its charges against the accused not out of his own mouth . " Accordingly , the defendant must go free if the evidence used to convict him includes a true yet tainted confession . <P> But how shall the courts determine voluntariness ? In Jackson 's case , New York saw its procedure as eminently fair-let the jury decide . Jackson nonetheless appealed to the Supreme Court , which last June handed down a landmark decision ( Jackson v. Denno ) voiding the New York procedure as unconstitutional . " The New York jury returns only a general verdict upon the ultimate question of guilt or innocence , " said Justice Byron White , speaking for a narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jury found the confession voluntary and relied upon it , or involuntary and supposedly ignored it . " <P> Cons ' Windfall . The court ruled that Jackson was entitled to a new evidentiary hearing solely to determine the voluntariness of his confession . ( He is getting a new trial next month . ) Out went New York-style procedure in 15 states , Puerto Rico , the District of Columbia , and six of the ten federal districts . But to two of the court 's dissenters , including Justice Hugo Black , the decision posed a new danger : it would affect hundreds of state and federal convicts whose challenged confessions had been admitted under New York procedure . If the Jackson rule was retroactive , as it seemed to be , prisoners whose confessions proved to have been involuntary were entitled to complete new trials. * <P> The New York Court of Appeals has just confirmed the dissenters ' fears . In the case of Charles Huntley , convicted of first-degree robbery in 1960 , the state 's highest court ruled that New York judges must now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself tackles the issue .
