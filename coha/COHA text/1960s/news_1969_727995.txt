txt From the airport into Dakar you drive along the Corniche . Your cab , new and fast , speeds you past expensive houses , exclusive clubs , and modern Dakar Univer- sity recently ' beset by radicalism and student strikes . ? On the other side of the road the Atlantic laps at Africa while clouds march across a horizon backlighted at dusk by magenta skies . Or to get from the airport into Dakar you can go by public transport . The old bus stops often . It takes you through Ouakam , a shantytown of wood and metal scrap which shelters peasants seeking urban excitement and a better life , people who have fled servitude to the land . Ouakam hits you : with its laughter , its color , with its communality , vitality , its open-air sociability  --  and with-its crowding , poverty , and dirtiness . Many of its residents regard it . as a staging base for better things . Dakar itself is a city of tall buildings and noisy hubbub . It has an undeniable African* // *Dakar points up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture from a colonial past . Peasant boy adrift Walking around it one evening you encounter a peasant sleeping on the sidewalk . He is a teen-age boy , his head cushioned on his cloak , wearing only his old , badly torn pair of shorts . He is not a common sight in Dakar . Still he is there . You remember hearing or near-famines in the bush , caused by drought . They have driven peasants into Dakar seeking food . Is this boy one of them ? The Corniche , Ouakam , and the nearly naked peasant suggest the gaps within Senegalese society ? and within those of other African states . These are the gaps between the elite and those camping on the outskirts of cities , between these two and the peasants . The gaps between these groups are widening . The situation in Senegal , stabler of the new African lustrates this process . This country spends 28 percent of its national income on education . Still , only about 40 percent of the children are in primary school . Two-thirds of the peasant children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In an era of rapid change and technological advance the traditionally raised peasant child who receives no education inhabits a different world from the urban child , even if the urban child also receives no schooling . If he receives several years of it the difference is exaggerated . Senegal came to independence with an elitist educational system . Now a prime need is to transform the system so that it better meets the needs of a developing nation . This need partly motivated the student strikes which hit this country both last year and a few weeks ago  --  but only partly , say informed observers . A great problem here is the resolve of students to maintain elite status and the prerogatives of the Corniche ? even while demanding educational reform . " These students want in , " says an experienced Western observer . " They want their slice of the pie . Their radicalism is different from student radicalism in the States . They are n't worried about the people in Quakam . " Apart from the radicalism which has swept universities around the world , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . Civil-service ranks filled In the past university graduates found immediate , well-paid employment in the civil service . But now civil-service ranks are filled with men far from retirement age . Thus one aspect of student desire for governmental change ? even for an overturning of the government ? is to empty the civil service of positions they can fill . The fact of widening gaps within Senegalese society does not necessarily threaten the government of President Leopold Senghor , observers contend . They cite several reasons : The dissatisfaction of young officers with the achievements of military coups elsewhere in Africa ; the retention by Mr. Senghor of the elements which maintain him in power ? the Army , the peasants , and certain Islamic leaders ; and the failure of recent student-led strikes to challenge the regime seriously . This failure shows the President still in control , observers say . They add that as the gaps continue to widen important changes will take place here . Already there is a recognition that Senegal 's problems must be solved within the nation , rather than through outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alien to the elite , that something must be done about the peasantry . Business makeover sought These realizations are significant first steps , says a close observer . But more difficult steps must follow : extending education , diversifying and reorienting the economy , and creating the necessary infrastructure . These steps must be accomplished through programs , this source says , because " there is no time for luck . " The devising and implementing of these programs are steps the Senegalese have not yet truly confronted , he holds . Another significant change  --  which this source calls " the next fight " ? will be the " Senegalization " of business at the foreman , supervisory , and managerial levels . The government hopes to accomplish this without resorting to dicta . Many foreign firms operating here realize this step must come , says this source , and will encourage it , though resistance is expected from the whites who will be replaced . It is into these business positions that the restless university students will have to go . These students do not yet fully recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibilities , the hard work , and uncertain rewards which go with business activity . But with the civil service filled , there is no other place for leadership talent to go .
