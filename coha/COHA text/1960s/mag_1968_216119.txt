France 's third heart-transplant patient is a man to whom the ethics and morality of the procedure are of more than usual concern . Father Damien Boulogne is a former professor of philosophy at Dominican seminaries . Two years ago , the priest had suffered a series of heart attacks that left him to tally disabled . Now 57 , Father Damien got his new heart at the Hpital Broussais-La Charit in Paris , where he is now recovering in sterile isolation . From there he wrote for La Vie Catholiqu an account of the soul-searching that preceded his operation . <P> Father Damien had no problems regarding the donor . " The donor , " he wrote , " is in no way ' sacrificed ' by the doctors . He has already been in a closed circuit heart-lung machine for days , and is therefore already dead ( flat electroencephalogram , etc . ) . His survival is artificial . So , no problem . " <P> Nor was Father Damien concerned about personality changes as a result of receiving a new heart . He cited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pump- " an admirable pump , but ' stupid , ' a machine having its own circuit . " <P> <P> His own role was more problematic : " Should I consult my superiors ? I asked and obtained their consent . " That still was not enough . In accepting artificial prolongation of his life , was he denying the will of God ? " That question lies between one 's conscience and God . Here the conscience , in confrontation with the love of God , takes its risks . In solitude . " <P> <P> Father Damien 's own resolution of the risks was in favor of the transplant , which he received May 12 . Last week , building himself up on a gourmand 's menu of pepper steak and Beaujolais , with a midnight snack of lamb chops among his five daily meals , he was busy correcting the proofs of his latest work-on St. Thomas Aquinas , who , says Father Damien , also believed that individual conscience , in individual circumstance , could and must override other rules in order to refer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
