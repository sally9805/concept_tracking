THE KINDLY ONES ( 254 pp. ) - Anfhony Powell-Little , Brown ( $4 ) . <P> <P> The kindly ones were the harbingers of all the gross Furies of history that were to despoil two generations of British youth . This , the sixth in Anthony Powell 's great series of novels , called The Music of Time , carries Narrator Nicholas Jenkins back to the outbreak of World War I and forward to the beginnings of World War II . <P> In the opening flashback to the eve of World War I , Nick Jenkins is a small boy living in his father 's country house at Stonehurst . The servants and the horses are in their quarters . The chef is good . All seems secure . There are no local portents of doom except a hysterical maid who appears to serve the mousse stark naked and is promptly whisked belowstairs in a Madras shawl . <P> The war breaks it all up , and war comes to the Jenkinses appropriately enough with the arrival of a general in a motorcar . A visiting uncle is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Not too keen on ' em . Always involved in accidents . Some royalty in a motorcar have been involved in a nasty affair today . " <P> Armpits &; Armageddon . All this may seem trivial and inconsequential , like a parlor game in which people amuse themselves by swapping anecdotes about what they were doing when they got the news of Pearl Harbor . But the reader , seduced by the perfectly tailored prose and the quiet delight of well-mannered comedy , may be led to overlook the muscular structure of Powell 's art . Nick Jenkins is no Prince Hamlet , but as an attendant lord he misses nothing ; his eyebrows are often raised , never his voice . Human action , Powell seems to be saying , is of primary importance in itself but secondary to the movements of history . The climactic events of the times take place while one 's attention is otherwise engaged-scratching an armpit or walking the dog . <P> Classic Comedy . In contrast to the innocents of pre-1914 , those who waited , in trance or stupor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it .
