 | Reality ? To find reality ? Search out and rediscover a reality which all these past six or eight years and two plays he had felt was beginning to be missing from his life and from his work ? Yes ; a reality , yes . Because without his work he was nothing . A nothing . And work was vitality , vitality and energy , and  --  manhood . So go ahead and say the rest of it . Yes , reality ; but also to search out and rediscover his Manhood . His Capital M Manhood , which along with reality and his work he was also losing . Yes , all that ; and also to get rid at least for a while in a genteel way of his aging mistress , the black figure on the church steps , whom he had once loved , but whom now he both in a strange way loved and did not love at all , equally and simultaneously , and whom he considered at least partially responsible for the loss of reality ( and Manhood ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he considered her , totally responsible for the loss . But in the end he had not gotten away from her at all , because she had invited herself to come with him , along with her husband . Actually it was she who had found Al Bonham for him ! She had come on down ahead , while he was in New York , had looked up and had waiting for him a diving teacher she considered reputable . And in the interim , during his business ' trip to New York with his newest , his latest play , something else had happened . Grant had met a girl . Big Al suddenly swung the wheel hard right , and the little boat made a sharp turn to starboard and headed off in that direction . They were far out on the open bay now . Directly ahead a mile away was the jet airstrip , one of three on the island , almost touching the blacktop road that ran along the water 's edge . " It 's right off the end of the airstrip , this reef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile out . I got two or three reference points I line up to hit it exact . " As violently as he had made the turn , which Grant considered strangely unnecessarily violent , he suddenly cut throttle and Grant grabbed the gunwale to keep from falling forward , as did Ali . For three or four minutes Bonham jockeyed the boat backward and forward , peering down over the side . " There she is , " he said . " My special spot . " Crain too looked over the side . Below him in the bluegreen water yellow and brown color-patches swirled and quivered under the water 's wash , Just beside these , and as if he were standing shoetips to the edge of u vertical high cliff , he could now and then as the sea flattened catch a glimpse of elem. sand fa below , dark-green colored through the surface . ' illy sun hat on his hawk , Grant felt cold at the thought of being immersed in %s Orr which was not in a bathtub and whose lack of heat could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bonham rumbled from just behind him , and began landing tanks and gear around as if none of it weighed anything  | As he had before , Grant noticed that Bonham dropped his bad grammar whenever he was giving instructions . Now he kept up a running comment of instruction while the two of them , he and All , got the neophyte ready . Flippers first , then the mask spat upon rubbed till it squeaked rinsed and resting on his forehead , rubber wet shirt , weightbelt trimmed to exactly the right weight by Bonham , finally the tank his arms through the shoulder straps crotch strap attached to the weight belt . Grant simply sat , like an electrocutionee he thought , and let himself be handled . The running comment of instruction had to do with clearing his ears and equalizing the pressure in them as he and Bonham went on down , and with what Bonham wanted him to do with his mask , which was to remove it when they reached the bottom of the anchorline , put it back on full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , swim forward to the anchorline , descend it ten or twelve feet , and wait for Bonham . Then last , the mask lowered over his eyes and nose , the mouthpiece stuffed into his mouth , and he was falling backward onto the tank on his back while faces and boat wheeled out of sight to be replaced by nothing but bright blue sky , what was he doing here ? Then the water closed over him , blinding him . Still holding the mask to his face with both hands in the approved manner to keep the fall from dislodging it , Grant rolled over quickly but he still could see nothing . He was now lying on the surface . Masses of bubbles formed by the air he had carried under with him rose all around him , blinding him even more effectively than a driving rainstorm would have done up in the air . He waited , vulnerable , what seemed endlessly but was really only seconds . Then , miraculously , everything cleared as the bubbles rose on past him , and he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on land . Maybe more . Because to his congenital mild myopia everything looked closer . It was supposed to . Snell 's Law . ( n Sin a = n ' Sin a ' ) . Oh , he 'd studied all the books  --  and for years . But this was different . Below him the yellow and brown patches were now clearly delineated fields of yellow and brown coral but in amongst these , invisible from the boat , were smaller patches of almost every color and color combination imaginable . It was breathtaking . And , as far as he could tell , there was nothing dangerous visible . Tentatively , cautiously , for the first time since he 'd gone under , Grant let out a little air and took a tiny breath . By God , it worked ! He became aware of the surface swell rolling him and banging the tank against his back . Bending double he dove down to where there was no swell as Bonham had told him , and swam slowly forward along the boat 's big shadow above him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could hear odd pophings and cracklings . With each intake of breath the regula-  | tor at the back of his neck sang eerily and gonglike , and with each exhale he could hear the flubbering rush of bubbles from it . Everything , all problems , all plans , all worries , mistress ' , her husband , new girl , the new play , sometimes even consciousness of Self itself , seemed to have been swept from his mind by the intensity of the tasting of this new experience , and new world . At the anchorline , after he managed awkwardly to grab it , he pulled himself down deeper hand over hand until his ears began really to hurt , and then stopped . As Bonham had shown him , he put thumb and forefinger into the hollows in the mask 's bottom and pinched his nose shut , and blew . One ear opened up immediately with a loud squeak , but he had to try a second and a third time before he could get the other one completely opened . Then he pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build again , and stopped again . Wrapping his legs around the line , he peered at the diving watch Bonham had sold him and set its outside bezel dial with the zero point over the minute hand . Then he peered at the huge handsome depth gauge beside it which Bonham had also sold him and saw that he was eighteen feet down . On his right arm the enormous Automatic Decompression Meter which Bonham had sold him still read zero ; its **29;232;TOOLONG needle had not yet even started to move . And so there he hung , having let go with his legs and grabbed the line with a hand , looking around . If Marty Gabel and Herman Levin could only see him now ! His nervousness had left him , and he felt a kind of cautious rapture . To his right and left coral hills forty and fifty feet high stretched away in minor mountain ranges into bluegreen invisibility . Directly in front of him at the foot of the deep end of these rounded ranges , a pure white sea of virgin sand sloped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the coral hills he could see down into channels  --  glaciers ; rivers  --  of sand which debouched onto the vast sand plain . In these channels , varieties of brightly colored fish poked their noses into holes in the coral , or rowed themselves gently along with their pectoral fins like small boats with oars . None of them seemed to be concerned with bothering any of the others , and ( : rant relaxed even more . Then , in the corner of his mask which acted like a horse 's blinders and cut his field of vision , lie caught a flash of silver . Turning his head he saw through the plate of glass a barracuda which appeared to be at least four feet long . It was about twenty feet away . Slowly it swam out of sight beyond his mask and ( : runt turned again . This process went on until *  | one big eye , it opened and closed its enormous mouth , exposing its dagger teeth , as if flexing its jaws preparatory to taking a bite of Grant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , but it did n't look nice just the same . Grant had read that in cases like this you were supposed to swim straight at them as if you intended to take a bite of them whereupon they would turn and flee and run away , but he did not feel very much like trying this . Besides , he was not supposed to leave the anchorline . On the other hand he felt he ought not just sit here and let the fish have all the initiative . But before he could make up his mind to do something , and if so then what , another figure swam into his mask 's field of vision , further complicating matters till Grant realized what it was . It was Bonham . Looking like some antennaed stranger from another world , which in a way he was , he swam down on a long slant behind the barracuda , leisurely beating the water with his flippers , his left arm with its hand holding the camera case stretched back at rest along his thigh , his right arm extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green water-air he was gravityless and beautiful , and Grant would have given anything to be like him . As he came on down getting closer , he stopped kicking and , hunching his shoulders in a strange way as if to make himself heavier , coasted down . Just as Grant saw his forearm tightening to squeeze the trigger , the barracuda gave an enormous flirt of its tail and simply disappeared . It did n't go away ; it just simply was no longer there , or anywhere visible , with an unbelievable speed if you had n't seen it . Bonham looked after it , shrugged , and swam on to the line . There was a great paternalism , protectiveness , about Bonham underwater . He looked Grant over carefully , turning him about and inspecting his gear , then with a violent hand motion downward swam on down the line toward the bottom . Grant followed , his nervousness returning . Twice he had to stop on the line to clear his ears and he suddenly noticed that Bonham apparently did not have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge calm great-bellied Buddha , Bonham and blew the water out of it by tilting his head to one side and holding the upper side of the mask . Then he motioned for Grant to do the same , as he had , upstairs , warned him that he would . Grant had done this in the various pools , but down here ( his depth gauge Bonham had sold him now read 59 feet ) he found it was more scary . It was all that water above you . Kneeling on the sand , he forced himself with the greatest reluctance to reach up and pull off his own mask .  | When he did , he immediately went blind . The salt water burned his eyes and the insides of his nose . He found himself gasping for breath . Bonham was now only one great blur to him . IIe made himself breathe deeply several times , and blinked . Then he put the mask back on and cleared it . Not as adept as Bonham , he had to blow several times to get all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big man was nodding happily and holding up his thumb and forefinger in the old circle salute for okay ' . Then he motioned for Grant to come and went swimming off six or eight feet above the sand . Grant followed , his eyes still smarting . He was ridiculously pleased . At the moment he felt very much the son to Bonham 's massive paternalism . This did not irritate him . Instead , it gave him reassurance . Bonham proceeded to point out the various corals . They were all very beautiful and interesting to look at  --  in a slimy , repugnant sort of way ? but you could only look at coral so long without getting bored . Apparently fully aware of this , Bonham  --  after pointing out a number of varieties ( including two which he warned Grant not to touch by wringing a hand and shaking it as if stung ) ? chose the exact moment of Grant 's increasing restlessness to show him something else . At the end of the coral hillock they had been exploring he swam over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him straight down over the steep side of the hillock to the sand channel bottom ( here Grant 's depth gauge Bonham had sold him read 63 feet ) , and there he pointed out two large caves . It was apparently true that Bonham knew this area like Grant knew his backyard . It was also apparent that he was conducting his tour and displaying his treasures one by one with the dramatic sense of a veteran entrepreneur . To Grant the caves were both exciting and frightening . The one on the left of the sand channel went back in under the coral hill they had just swum over ; way back in there some hole running clear to the top of the coral allowed a shaft of sunlight to penetrate all the way to the bottom , illuminating greenly some strange coral shapes growing on the sand ; outside , its entrance was huge , not a real cave mouth at all , but more an overhang that ran almost the entire length of the side of the hillock . From nndcr this overhang Grant carefully stayed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already swum on in . Turning his head , he motioned CI ant to follow . Biting hard on the two rubber tits of the mouthpiece bets%een his teeth , tightening his lips over the whole , Grant descended a little and entered . Scared as he was , it was magnificently beautiful in there . The ceiling was only fifteen or twenty feet from the sand floor , much lower than it had looked from outside . Several good-sized tunnels  | showing sunlight at their ends led off from it and looked safe for exploring . But Bonham was already swimming back out , motioning him to follow . The other cave , across the channel , was really no more than a fissure , running maybe thirty feet up an almost perpendicular dead-coral cliff , hardly wide enough to admit a man , and it was to this one now that Bonham led him . Gesturing Grant to follow , the big man swam up the fissure to a point that appeared slightly wider than the rest , snaked himself through , and disappeared . When Grant followed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter . When he did , his tank banged alarmingly on the rock behind him . He remembered reading stories of fellows who had cut their air intake hoses on sharp coral , and who had barely got out alive by luck , superior experience , and by keeping their heads . Trying to keep his air intake hose ( without being able to see it ) somewhere near the center of the cleft , Grant pulled himself along with his hands on the sucky , unpleasantly viscid living corals growing here . But when he was in far enough that he could no longer bend his knees to flutter his feet , the panicky breathlessness , the sensation of being unable to breathe , to get enough air , which panic brings , and which he knew from before , hit him debilitatively . Stopping , he forced himself to breathe deeply but it did n't help . Suddenly his instinct was to throw off everything and run for the surface blindly , even though covered by coral rock , get to anywhere where there was air . Instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , trying to keep his movements slow and liquid , unviolent , though by now he did n't care whether the coral cut him or not . Actually , he had only been inches away from freedom . The last pull with his arms brought him head and shoulders almost to his waist out into the open . One breast stroke with his arms and he was free , swimming almost forty feet above the bottom . Bonham , who Grant now realized had been directly in front of him watching and ready to help , had already rolled over head down and like an airplane in a full dive was swimming straight down toward the bottom , his flippers beating leisurely and slow , his arms holding camera and gun extended backward along his thighs to streamline . For a moment Grant was seriously angry at him , for taking such a chance with him on his first dive . Still breathing deeply , though slower and slower now as his heart and adrenal glands got back to normal , Grant watched in a kind of witless stupor as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet above the bottom the big man leveled off over a huge coral toadstool and rolled over face up , and slowly sank to a  | crosslegged sitting position on it , his head back looking up , for all the world like some great , oneeyed humanoid alien frog from Alpha Centauri or somewhere . Still looking up , he motioned for Grant to come on down . Still staring , still breathing deeply from his fright in the narrow entrance , Grant suddenly realized with a start which brought him back out of his post-panic stupor that he was lying here all stretched out forty feet up in the air from this other man , relaxed , his arms out over his head like a man in a bed . Because it really could have been air . Seemed like air . The greentinted water was crystal clear here inside , and Bonham by seating himself on the toadstool had avoided stirring up any sand clouds as they had done outside . For the first time with any real physical appreciation , Grant realized how delicious it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds ; he could go up , he could go down , he could stay right where he was ; in the strange spiritual excitement of it , his fear left him completely . Feeling ridiculous again because of his recent panic there , he glanced once at the narrow entrance fissure , then rolled over head down using exactly ( though slower ) the same body movements he once used to do a full-twisting half gainer , and corkscrewed gently down  --  relishing the leisurely control  --  into a vertical dive , his hands and arms straight back along his thighs palms up , his fins beating lazy and slow , as he had seen Bonham do . Only once did he have to clear his ears , and he did it now without pausing . Below him Bonham got larger and larger . Then , duplicating Bonham 's maneuver , he rolled over onto his back , exhaled and sank into a sitting position on the giant toadstool beside him , his knees clasped up to his chin . Unable to speak , or even to grin , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The big man nodded vigorously , then touching him gently , pointed upward , sweeping his arm across the view like a man unveiling a painting . For the first time since he had entered , Grant looked up . What he saw very nearly took away the breath he had just regained . He was in an immense cavern at least sixty feet high . Apparently the bottom here inside was ten or so feet lower than the sand channel bottom outside . From where he sat at one end the other was almost lost in a hazy nearinvisibility . In the dim ceiling a dozen holes allowed clusters of greenish sunrays to strike at varying angles across the interior until they shattered against the sand bottom or rock walls . Each beam wherever it struck against bottom or walls revealed weird outlandish coral sculptures . It was more thvi breathtaking , it was like having stumbled upon some alien cathedral on some other planet , which some otherworld race with their inr uilrrehensible architecture and alien sculpture had ages past built , ( lee-  | orated and dedicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not physically this time , but spiritually . For a moment he forgot he was diving underwater in an aqualung . Was that some fourheaded Great Saint whom they worshipped , there on the side wall ? Was that seventy-eyed monster , all head and almost no body , resting on the sand floor , the Great Being Himself ? And as always , when he found himself alone in an empty church  --  as he had when a boy , as he had when visiting the great churches and cathedrals of Europe and found one or another of them deserted  --  Grant felt himself beginning to get an erection in the dim stillness . Was it the privacy ? Was it the quiet ? Or was it the highceilinged dimness ? Or was it maybe the nearness of God ? the nearness of Unknowable ? Embarrassed , he shifted away sideways , afraid Bonham might notice what was happening inside his tight , scanty bikini , and the feeling began to subside . Anyway he knew one thing for certain . One day while he was here in Ganado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come alone if he had to rent a rowboat and aqualung from Bonham 's competitor  --  make a dive down here alone , strip off this damned bikini , swim around this cave stark naked with his erection , then sit on this toadstool and masturbate , come like a fury , and watch his milky semen swirl and mingle with the green water which itself swirled about his body with every tiniest movement . Maybe he 'd hire a nondiving native to handle the boat for him . The very secrecy of it , the native up there working the boat and him down here masturbating , made it a tinglingly exciting prospect . But , was this not a too-ambitious project for a neophyte diver just starting out : jerking off underwater ? Well , he would find out . The idea of masturbating made him think of his new girl in New York . She , it had turned out , had loved that . Bonham touched him gently again , on the shoulder , and Grant started guiltily . When he looked over , the other was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Grant asked " Why ? " by shrugging up his shoulders and spreading out his hands , Big Al pointed to his watch . Looking at his own Grant saw they had been under 32 minutes , and could hardly believe it . And it reminded him of something else . During his last few breaths it had seemed to Grant that it was getting slightly harder to breathe each time , but the difference was so slight he had thought he was imagining it . Now he tried again and found it was distinctly harder to suck air from the lung . His neophyte 's nervousness returned to him suddenly . But neither man had yet pulled his reserve valve ! ? Grabbing his mouthpiece with one hand and pointing to his tank with the other , Grant made a heaving motion with his chest as if trying to  | breathe . Bonham nodded . But then he followed the nod by fanning his hands back and forth across each other in a gesture of " Take it easy ; do n't worry . " Gesturing Grant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from the toadstool with a little leap upward like a bird . But it was more like a foot-winged Mercury than a bird , Grant thought as he followed . He was no longer nervous . Underwater at least , he now trusted Bonham completely . Forgotten was the momentary anger at Bonham 's having taken him through the narrow fissure . Ahead of him Big Al swam upward on a long diagonal straight across the length of the green cathedral . He did not turn off to the right toward the fissure . Grant assumed , rightly , that there was another entrance ? which made him feel good , because he had no liking for the fissure . As he rose on the long diagonal , the air in his tank expanded as the pressure lessened and it became easier to breathe and he understood why Bonham had motioned him not to worry . Only if they had had to descend again into greater pressure , he remembered now from the books , would they have needed their reserve valves . Grant remembered to exhale frequently as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swam , he looked at his Automatic Decompression Meter Bonham had sold him it showed there was no need to worry about decompression . So they were leaving , orrather  --  returning . Ten yards ahead of him Bonham swam into and then out of some of the slanting rays of sunlight which crossed the cave , strangely bright and glowing when he was in one , almost invisible when he was in the darker water inbetween . Grant could not resist pausing and turning for a look back . He felt a curious sad tranquillity , toward all inevitability , because he had to leave . But when he looked , he found he was already forty-five or fifty feet above the bottom and the toadstool was no longer visible from here . With a second 's tingling excitement in his groin he knew now more than ever that , eventually , he would come back here and descend into that invisibility and sitting on that same toadstool looking up , masturbate himself . Play with himself , he added , in the jargon of his parents . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner into an alcove-cum-tunnel almost , it the ceiling of the cavern and was waiting for him . Ahead at the end of it was sunlight , and together in this more than comfortably wide spate they swain toward it , then through it and back into the world . fist the dive was . tit ill not over . Emotionally , it was , perhaps ; but they still had to get h n k to the boat . Bonham did not even bother to surface and hook uruuml hit ( he really did know this area like his backyard ) struck off  | up and over the coral hillock they had just left the insides of , and which came to within less than ten feet of the surface . Grant could not see boat or anchorline ahead , but Bonham was obviously heading straight for them . Below them as they swam were the tangled , trashy staghorn-coral beds  --  the brown ones , their hunks of old fishing line caught here and there , rusting beercans in the low spots  --  which marked the hillock 's crest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was hard to believe they had been inside this hill , and that it was damned near entirely hollow . Grant 's sadness at leaving it  --  out here in the sunlit , brightly coral-studded , open water  --  was slowly turning into a wild kind of elation . Above him the surface was only a few feet away , and every now and then  --  as in some silvered but unsolid mirror  --  he could see himself or Bonham , grossly distorted , reflected back from the underside of it as it moved . His air , without his pulling of the reserve lever but getting harder and harder to draw , lasted just exactly to the side of the boat . At the boat he had a bad moment when , trying to shuck out of his tank straps and pass the lung up to Ali , he went under gulping seawater and almost choked ; but then he was over the side and in the boat safe from sharks , barracuda , Portuguese meno ' - war , the bends , air embolism , busted eardrums , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to make it seem so hard ? His elation continued to grow . Behind him Bonham handed up his own lung easily and smoothly , moved his bulk smoothly up the little ladder and over the side and , dripping wet , started the motor . Ali ran forward to haul in the anchor . Before Grant could get himself out of Ali 's clinging wet shirt Bonham had sold him , the diver and his helper were headed back to shore full throttle like two men going home from the office , Bonham at the wheel and Ali dismantling the lungs . In the west the sun was still quite a few yards above the big mountain that jutted out into the sea . Grant 's new elation lasted all the way back to shore , and longer . It lasted through the Yacht Club and then to Bonham 's shop in the dirty old station-wagon , where they left Ali . It lasted through all the drinking and eating they two did at Bonham 's favorite bar after that . It lasted , in fact , until around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path to the villa where his mistress ' and her husband were staying , to go to bed . Then it completely disappeared , when he discovered his mistress ' was still up . In the boat he had been shaking and chattering uncontrollably as he rubbed himself down with the towel Bonham thoughtfully handed him from the wheel . IIe had not felt unduly cold downstairs ' , as Bonham  | called it , but up here in the air and speed-induced breeze he was freezing . When he stepped to the gunwale of the rolling cockpit after discovering he had to piss , his penis  --  so counter to the half-erection he had had down below  --  was shrunk up so from his cold chill that he had to search for it in his pubic hair and stretch it out by hand . None of any of that had stopped him from talking . When he had turned from the rail , Bonham had been holding out the gin bottle to him with one hand and wiping his mouth with the back of the other , the wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm . When the hand came away , the mouth was seen to be grinning widely over his bad teeth . " So you think you liked it , hunh ? " he demanded . " Well , that 's only the start . " Vicariously , though he obviously had none of his own really , he was able to share Grant 's elation . In contrast to Grant he had worn no wet shirt and had not toweled off and was letting the wind dry him , but he was n't cold . Trickles of seawater continued every now and then to run down his face from his hair as he spoke . He had ducked his head back into the water face up before climbing aboard , Grant had noticed , and the sea had slicked back his hair as well as any comb ever could , so that in contrast to Grant 's wildly disordered hair he looked positively well-groomed . Ile could not stop grinning apparently , as he accepted the bottle back , as though he really did share Grant 's enthusiasm , and Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know to whom , or to what ) ? that they two had established a rapport between them with this dive which almost no one  --  for instance Ali , a nondiver , or Grant 's mistress , or her husband ? could share who was not a diver himself . And maybe all of them could n't share it , unless they had been down in the cathedral cave with Bonham themselves . " Here . Have another one , " Bonham grinned , extending the bottle after taking a second slug himself . " Warm you up . " It was the second of a great many rounds they were to down before the ( lay , and the evening , were over . Grant was plain full of all sorts of technical questions , and he kept them coming one after the other . For instance , wlwn Bonham had taken off his lung at the boat , instead of hanging onto the ladder and trying to keep his head out of water in the swells , like ( : r , nit , lu had descended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shucked his tank off over his head like a man taking off a sweater , while never letting the mouthpiece out of his mouth , and then had swum back till to the boat with it . Why had lie done that ? It was a keen trick , and had somebody taught it to him ? And did Bonham have that much extra air  | left ? because he , Grant , had been completely out when they reached the boat  --  unless of course he had pulled the reserve . Yes , Bonham said , he had had more air left , because Grant did n't conserve his . " You remember when you went through that rock fissure into the big cave ? You used a lot of extra air there because you got a little panicky . And probly a couple of other times . Like when you first went in . " But that was nothing ; after a while Grant would learn to save air both by relaxing and by never breathing until he really needed it . As for taking the bottle off over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier . No , nobody taught it to him . He thought it up himself . But probly lots of other divers did it too . Just because it was easier . " And in this racket , anything that is easier , requires less effort and energy , is the better way to do a thing . Simply because saving energy saves air . " " Well , what about taking me through that narrow place like that ? Is n't that a pretty advanced maneuver ? for somebody like me ? on their very first dive ? " Bonham shook his head no . " I do n't usually take people through there in their first sea dive . I do n't usually take them in that cave . That 's true . But you 're pretty cool . A lot cooler than you think you are , for some strange reason . Usually it 's just the reverse . People think they 're cool and they ai nt . " Anyway , I was right there watching . I could have got you out all right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on through ! " Grant laughed . Bonham grinned . He had decided , he suddenly interjected , to dock the boat at the Yacht Club tonight . He was getting bored with that crappedup dirty commercial dock , even if it was closer to the shop . Something about his face , looking straight ahead out through the windshield , gave ( : rant a distinct impression that there was more to it than that , and that the something more had to do with himself , but Bonham did not admit more . Nor did Grant question him . And as they ran on in , his diction and his grammar began to undergo that peculiar change from educated and expressive to uneducated and laconic , which Grant had noticed now several times before . He was evidently preparing the personality he wished to present at the Yacht Club  --  for whatever reasons . When they came abreast of the Club , he swung the boat hard left at full throttle in that violent style of his , immediately and at once cutting throttle ( as he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way in amongst the small launches and sailboats to a mooring close to the dock . From there Ali  | rowed the two of them in to the long wooden dock in the bathtub-sized plastic dinghy which Bonham kept lashed down on the cabin roof , and returned for the tanks and regulators and to clean up . Bonham and Grant had already dressed on the boat , and went on to the bar . Bonham had covered his slicked back , thinning hair with a beatup , old , but expensively made and very salty looking yachting cap bearing a crusted gold Captain 's symbol , which he had pulled from the drawer where the gin bottle was . Grant had been to the Yacht Club twice before , both times late in the evening for a drink after dinner , both times with his mistress ' and her husband . Both times he had found it nearly deserted and pretty dull . The only amusement was a European-type pool game with holes in the middle of the table protected by skittles which must not be knocked over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of minutes before the timer shut off and retained the balls . He and the husband had played . It was a pretty middleclass , pretty deadly place in a way which only certain British or British-Colonial institutions can be . Built modern of concrete in four stories ( each with its veranda ) up the side of a bluff from the water 's edge to the street , it was much prettier onside than in , which was not saying much . Now , however , at the cocktail hour , it was cheerfully crowded with a harddrinking crowd of local members , residents , and winter visitors ' . Bonham knew them all , and he introduced Grant to all of them . Most of them were sophisticated enough , and had money enough , to spend a couple or three weeks once or twice a year in New York , be knowledgeable of American theater , and so knew who Grant was , had heard he was in town , and were glad to have him down they said . Grant was personable and charming with all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a corner and talking diving , to being Bonham 's celebrity . This , however , was impossible since Bonham , after ordering the two of them drinks , was now engrossed in a conversation with two Club members about a 38-foot Matthews marlin boat which had been put up for sale over in Montego Bay . The gist was that Bonham , as he made plain in his deliberately bad diction and bad grammar way , wanted to buy it but was afraid it was not in good shape . The two Club members were assuring him that it was in good shape , that they had seen it , and then Bonham would only shake his head dubiously and it would all start over . When Ali came up from the boat and Bonham , after ordering them both still more drinks , sent him off on foot to go get the station-wagon at the commercial dock , : rant was glad . But by the time he got back , Bonham , after ordering them drinks a couple of times more , was heatedly discussing with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out was vice-  | chairman ! ) the meeting they were calling for next Thursday . And Grant was defending his old pal Tennessee Williams from three well-to-do ladies . By the time Ali had got the tanks and regulators loaded in the car , Bonham had ordered them one more round of drinks . Then Grant paid and they left . Grant had n't minded the drinking , or even the paying . He was a good boozer himself , and he suspected Bonham was short of cash . But he was still high with elation over his dive , and he wanted to remain up there with it . It was all very strange , and quite hard to explain , and the only way he could word it was that it made him somehow feel more manly . More manly than he had felt in quite a long time . And he wanted Bonham to himself to talk about it . Not about that part of it , but about the ( live itself , and about diving in general . " I did n't know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car , in an oblique reference to the PTA . " How many have you got ? " Bonham appeared suddenly to have become somewhat somnambulant , out in the air and the dark . " Ai nt got any , " he said , very shortly . " Wife teaches school , " and he motioned vaguely upward with his head toward what appeared to be the left front corner of the car roof , but which was in fact the mountainside along which they were driving and upon which , high up , Grant knew there nestled a school . A ritzy one . " I did n't know you were married , " he said . Bonham did not answer right away . " Well , I am , " he said finally . Grant hesitated delicately , then made his voice cheery . " Your wife 's Ja-maican ? " " Yeah , " Bonham said immediately and without reservations . " But she 's very light . " He drove on a way before he added , " She 's Jewish axly . Mostly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbus gave most of Jamaica to his relatives . So it was mainly them , the Jewish , who were the first settlers . " " I 'd like to meet her someday , " Grant said . Bonham visibly seemed to settle stolidly into some protected interior of his nigh-immovable bulk . From it he spoke calmly . But it , his marriage , was plainly something he did n't like to talk about , or even think about , apparently . " Sure . You will . Someday . She 's a great girl . " " I 'm sure , " Grant said . " You know , I could n't help overhearing your conversation with those two guys at the bar about buying that boat . The Mat thews . I do n't mean to stick my nose in . But can you afford ? " Bonham snorted . " Shit , no . Wish I could . But I would n't buy that boat if I could . "  | " But then why did you ? " " Because you got to put on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely those other two g " Course they did , " Bonham rumbled slowly . " They know exactly how much I 'm worth . Just like I know exactly how much they 're worth . And they know I 'm not worth that kinda money . " Then his grammar and diction suddenly got precise and educated again . " But that 's the game . I pretend I can . Because that 's the way they all act . That 's the way they function . And when I act the same , it proves to them that I 'm like them . I 'm normal . Then they 'll accept me . Why do you think I joined that damned PTA ? Hell , I joined the Rotary , and the Kiwanis , and the Chamber of Commerce . If you want to be a part of any social group , you have to join in their little rituals . " " I 'm not at all sure it 's all that easy , " Grant murmured . " I wish it were , " he added sadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already stopped the car in the middle of Grant 's two sentences and gotten out , though pausing outside to listen to the end of it , and then began giving Ali his orders without answering Grant : everything was to be hosed down , fresh water , the regulators were to be laid out on the workbench and stripped completely down and washed ( Bonham always tore his regulators down after every sea dive and checked them he said , especially the ones used by clients ) , Ali was to be there at eight in the morning because they had a young couple wanted a pool checkout at the Royal Loggerhead . Under the necessity to work , or at least give orders to work , his earlier somnambulance , if that was what it was , seemed to have left him . " I know a great little bar and restaurant where I hang out a lot , " he said as he climbed back in and slammed the door . " It 's not expensive and they got great steaks and a great bunch of guys hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you say we go there and do some serious drinkin and then have somethin to eat ? If you really want to talk diving , that 's the place . " " Okay . For the drinks part , anyway . But I got to be back to the villa for ( lame ( " I lc was supposed to dine at the villa with his mistress and her hied i , tiid and their hosts the Count and Countess de Blystein , because the n ' were to he two other couples , local winter residents ' ( which meant tIR  --  v o vii ? d plces ) , whom the Countess had invited for the express purp ? ( more or less unstated ) of meeting Ron Grant . However , it was only it little after seven , and he could easily be back by a quarter of nine to c h:ui ; e , ( : oulcl n't he ? Of course he could . " Why not ? " he said .  | In the end , though , he had not gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of his mind that he would n't . He had stayed with Bonham . It was probably a serious social breach , but he knew he could laugh the Countess  --  Evelyn  --  out of it . Not so his mistress ' . She would be furious , not only because she loved showing him off , but also because she loved and adored the Countess Evelyn and the Countess Evelyn 's standing , while going to great lengths to pretend not to . But it had been the thought of her , as much as of the dull evening itself , which had been the deciding factor in his saying to himself what the hell ? I 'll stay out . Down below in the cave during the dive , when he had gotten stuck on sex and the thought of his new girl in New York , his mind had automatically brought up his mistress too , the old mantilla-ed witch-mother image standing on the church steps pointing , as it had done for years . But down there , sixty feet underwater in a cavern and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had shut that off , shut her off , as if with a special new interrupter click-switch in his brain . It was the first time this had ever happened to him , and it was a new sensation . Click-switch the witch . It felt almost exactly like the sensation he used to experience in a physical way when he would sit in the dentist 's chair and have his teeth ground and would click a switch in his head and turn off the pain . He had learned to do that years ago when , after his first play was a hit , he had had his whole mouth rebuilt by a marvelous dentist but who did not like to use the old-fashioned impure novocain they were using back then . But it had never happened to him before with a self-inflicted moral obligation . Something somewhere in his brain had changed maybe ? Afterwards , feeling around cautiously inside his head , he had tried to find what was changed and had failed . Everything had seemed to be stored pretty much where it used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl ( or was he ? ) any more than he had been in love with a lot of other girls over the past ten years , and anyway Grant no longer believed in love ; he was ( as he well knew ) at that age . So it could n't be her , or could it ? He was not , he was sure , a changed ' man because of a few lessons and one dive in the sea in an aqualung . Or was it that : had such a little bit of diving that quickly made him into a man again ? ( Again ? ! ) Whatever it was , he just no longer gave a damn about a dark-shrouded , mantilla-ed , hidden-faced figure standing on the church steps pointing . He did n't have to think about her . He could just shut her off , and now he did not want to unlock the switch until he absolutely had to . It would be one of those long , conversational dinners , with good food and good wine whose enjoyment would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessities . Afterward they would play poker on the Countess Evelyn 's beautiful feltcovered mahogany poker table and/or backgammon on Evelyn 's beautiful inlaid boards with ivory counters . Most of them ( all but his mistress ' ) would drink . Her husband would drink a lot . And so would Grant . Grant was having too much fun with Bonham , and  --  also  --  learning too much about diving and divers . Grant had never seen anybody eat and drink as much without showing it at all , or any after-effects of it . When they first came in , Bonham had ordered a platter of six superburgers which when Grant declined he ate all of as they drank . Later they each ate a huge imported American sirloin served with enough frenchfries to bury a battleship . Between them , with only a very few drinks given away here and there , they put away almost two bottles of gin and innumerable tonics . And finally around two in the morning Bonham had three more superburgers as a snack . Somewhere along the line they were joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonham knew , and when he left with the handsomer of these he walked as straight as a die . When Grant paid the bill , he found it was much less than he had expected . Bonham knew everybody in the place , of course . Mostly they were a mixture of working people running from boatmen and fishermen , plumbers and electricians , all the way up to small-fry white collar people who worked for the government , for local businessmen , or for the big hotels . Of the two Jamaican girls who joined them one worked as a nursetechnical assistant to a dentist and the other ran a gift shop in the Royal Loggerhead . And yet in spite of so much seduction talk to the girls , so many greetings , jokings , drink acceptings ( and offerings ) , the big man managed to impart to Grant quite a bit of interesting learning about diving . In the car driving over Grant had mentioned his notice of Bonham 's two distinct sets of language and diction . The big man had only grinned and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " That was all he offered . Here , in this place , he spoke a very carefully very low-class lingo , excepting only the ' inn 's he was speaking seriously to Grant about the technical aspects of diving . He went into at some length the various aspects of his work as a real working diver , as contrasted to his teaching and taking out of tourists . The trouble was there just were n't that many working-dive jobs around all the time to keep you going . Grant listened , and kept nodding . And finally , when they had both drunk a lot and he had got his courage up high enough with booze , Grant got in his question about sex , about orgasm in the aqualung . " Did you ever fuck anybody underwater , Al ? " Both the girls giggled .  | " Hell , yes ! " Bonham said and put his arm around the ass of the nearer girl , who just happened to be the prettier one . " I would be willin to bet that anybody who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once underwater . It ai nt hard . The ony thing is , one of you has got to hold on or you float right apart . " He grinned . The two girls were fascinated . " Well , how deep ? " Grant asked . " Oh , fifty feet . Seventy-five . Easy . Depth do n't matter at under a hundred and fifty feet . Why ? You got some ambitions ? " It was Grant 's turn to grin . " Oh , well , sure . Naturally . Eventually . But do n't you uh get out of breath ? " " Hell , yes . It 's great . " Here the girls both laughed out loud . " But that do n't make no difference . Matter of fact , if you just roll over on your back so 's your regulator 's lower than your mouthpiece , the difference in pressure 'll flush your lungs right out for you . All the girl divers I ever knew loved to get laid underwater . " So Grant had his answer . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increased breathing rate which comes with sexual exercise that had worried him . Relaxing , a little drunkenly now , he knew again that great private excitement of pleasure which always came with the rediscovery , the reutilization , of the fact that the interior of one 's own mind can always be kept secret , that nobody can ever really tell what you 're thinking if you do n't want them to . In happy silence , he sat back and looked around the bar at all the people who did n't know the interior of Ron Grant 's mind . It was only shortly after this that Bonham announced his intention of leaving with the girl whose ass his arm encircled . He announced it in a rather odd way , which was a sudden lowpitched , bass giggle that erupted from him . " Me and Enid are gon na take off fum here in that goddam ole station-wagon of mine and go and park it somewhere in some glorious quiet canefield . Ai nt we , sweetie ? " " Hell , yes ! You dam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dentist 's assistant . " You 're perfectly welcome to come along , " Bonham said . " Susie there would be more than glad to have you for her fella for tonight . " " I most shurely would , " Susie smiled . " I 'd enjoy to know you a deal betteh , Misteh Grant . You 're very famous in Ganado Bay . I 'd like to love with you . " Grant shook his head . He liked her . She was just almost as goodlooking and attractive as the other girl . There was very little to choose . But suddenly , working somewhere deep inside him , was the thought of his new  | girl in New York holding him back . Suddenly it was hard to believe it was only not quite five days since he had been with her . They had been together only a little over three weeks , and that was hard to believe , too . It was like some kind of talisman he had in her , that he would lose if he stepped out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cab out to the Royal Loggerhead or the West Moon Over and calling her . But the lousy phone service here took so damned long , at least an hour , and half the time the connection was so bad you could n't hear or be heard except for a word or two . It would be more frustrating than good . And anyway what did he want to call her for ? He begged off charmingly with Susie , not wanting to hurt or insult her , on the grounds of fatigue , too much booze , and a deep depression . To him it sounded lame . But if it was , Bonham came to his rescue . " He 's got something serious botherin him , girls . I do n't know what it is , because he do n't talk . Maybe it 's an idea for a new play . Anyway . . . Grant looked at him , suddenly remembering for the first time that the big man was married . Bonham drunk was very little different from Bonham sober . The only thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned a bit more blackly . Bonham moved . " Well , since Ron ai nt goin , why do n't you come on and go along with us two , Susie ? " " Okeh , " Susie grinned . " Why not ? " She gave Grant her hand as they all got up . " It ratheh a shame , but we see each otheh . Maybe you be in a betteh mood Some Time . " Then to the others she lapsed into the Jamaican patois , a  --  to Grant  --  totally unintelligible , mumbled jumble of broad , flat vowel sounds , and whatever it was she said made the others both laugh out loud . " What did she say ? " " She said it was very bad luck for her because you looked like a helluva good piece of loving for tonight , " Bonham said ; and Grant almost changed his mind about going . But he did n't ; could n't . He watched them away , creaking off in the beatup old station-wagon . Sounds of bright , rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He motioned for a taxi . The taxi deposited him , at his request , at the foot of the villa drive . It was about a quarter of a mile up to the great-house , uphill through the lush rich growths of special and rare tropical trees and plants which Evelyn and Paul de Blystein made a specialty of collecting . Grant walked it slowly under the hot burnished tropical sky , smelling the fleeting  --  fleeting because overabundant  --  flower and plant odors , thinking mostly about  | the dive he had made . The closer he came to the door , the more his elation turned into depression . Only one night light was burning . In his guestroom he stripped himself naked , made himself a stiff drink at the little bar in one corner and climbed into bed with it . Almost as soon as he turned off the light , his door opened softly and his mistress , his mistress ' , came in : a flowing white shadow in the dark . Hello , Lady Macbeth he suddenly felt like saying , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black-draped , black-mantilla-ed , black-shrouded face , black-flowing , sleeved arm pointing : black of church , black of religion , black of guilt . Of course , if it were black now , he would n't see it . Or would he ? " You son of a bitch , " she whispered . Grant closed his eyes . " I made my first dive today . " " Do you know what you did to me ? ? To us ? " " I said I made my first dive today . In the sea . " " Evelyn was furious . " " I 'll laugh her out of it . " She had sat down on the side of the bed and now smelled him . " And drunk , too ! " " Not drunk . Just high . Did I tell you , I made my first dive today . " " Until two-thirty in the morning ? Hah ! " The tone was ugly . " We went out late . To a reef off the airport . When we got back , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat . And to talk diving . I forgot the time . " " Until two-thirty in the morning ! " Tone uglier . " I wanted to talk diving . " " I do n't know what 's the matter with you , " the ugly voice said . " But something is . Anyway I do n't like it . And I do n't have to put up with it and I 'm not going to . It must be some little pig of a whore , some cunt you picked up in New York . Is that it ? " For a moment Grant thought about telling her . But he stayed silent . " It must be that . That 's what it always is , " the voice said . There was no give in it , no give at all . " Because that 's what you always do . Every time you go . Some hot-assed little whore who wants to take you for everything you got . Everything I helped you to earn . " Grant did n't answer . Beside him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a rustle of clothing . The voice when it came was strident , harsh , loudly grating , though still in a whisper . " Good will is worked out as qualifying the life of a group of Masters ? ( masters of their own destiny ) ? under the care of a Master of the Wis-  | dom ? ( ' Gnostic ' ) . The WILL-TO-GOOD is developed and understood in the groups of those of still greater attainment and is concerned with Purpose . GOOD WILL has vision ! Will-to-Good . Then you have Illumination . " Grant still did n't answer . " You know all that as well as I do , " she said harshly . " I 've taught you all I know . " Her mules hit the floor . Then , naked , she climbed into the double bed under the sheet and lay beside him as stiff as a board . She was lying there stiff as a varnished bowstring waiting for him to screw her . Grant did n't know if he could . In silence he finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of how embarrassing it would be for her if he did n't , plus a vague moral obligation which he knew was ridiculous , plus the fact that she was a female , all came to his aid . God forgive me , he thought to his new girl in New York , you forgive me . Gracelessly , flat on his back , he groped at her crotch a little to aid him . Her arms above her head , she did not move . He rolled over onto her , stuck it in her , and pumped away until he came . As always , she neither raised her legs nor moved . As he was falling into sleep , he heard again the rustle of clothing as she put back on her nightgown and her robe , then the soft closing of the door . Awakened by it , he lay wide awake a long time staring at the ceiling and thinking about New York .  | TIE HAD ARRIVED there halfway between Christmas and New Year 's , and the holiday drinking season was on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Side cocktail lounge . It had snowed all the way through Ohio and Pennsylvania on the train and it was still snowing in Manhattan when his train from his hometown Indianapolis pulled into Grand Central . At six in the evening it was already dark , Christmas lights glistered everywhere , and people hurried into Grand Central on their way home , or picked their way along the streets through the slush desperately looking for cabs . All of Grant 's most horrible sentimentalities for Manhattan as well as his most rabidly hate-filled memories of it , this particular day called up in him . From the station he had taken a cab straight to his reservation at the New Weston at 49th and Madison . They would be pulling the New Weston down soon . It was strange how later in Jamaica in February , so short a time after that day in December , all of his previous memories of New York  --  even those going back the full thirteen years he had known it  --  were now somehow tied up with the new girl he had met , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that city had been reconstructed emotionally in his head to include the image of  --  a laughing 27-year-old siren from upper New York State named Lucky Videndi . At thirty-six he should be embarrassed even to use such a phrase . But that was the way he thought of her . Lucia Angelina Elena Videndi . Even the memories of those very early , barren , broke days in New York and his life there right after the war , now seemed to include her brightening image , making everything seem less dark and awful , less bad than it actually had been . And he had never even seen her until a few weeks ago . TIe did not meet her , actually , until January loth  --  although he met some others . But those others . . .  | In the nine years since his first big success Grant had been around a fair amount for a famous man . Especially whenever he came on to New York . In the faster sets of girls ( he found out later from Lucky , who knew them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very good lay and a better diver , but a man who did not want encumbering entanglements and might therefore be half fag . He was also the last of the unmarried writers . But his real trouble ( Grant knew ) was that the terrible bonecracking loneliness , the " Miseries " , that he suffered whenever he was without a girl , and which drove him like a whipped horse , was strengthened rather than lessened whenever he dropped into sleep sated but not satisfied beside one of them , sniffing at the delicious pissy female odors permeating his moustache . They did n't give a real damn about him any more than he gave a damn about them . That was his real trouble . That , and his sense of responsibility to his mistress . He did n't want to hurt her . However ridiculous that might seem . But with Lucky all of that changed . " You know what ? " he said one afternoon in Florida , his head on her chest and his lips nuzzling at the pool of sweat that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half asleep and he had a sense of revelation . " We 're Hansel and Gretel , you and me . And the world is the woods . " " I 've always thought of us as Clark Gable and Carole Lombard , " Lucky said softly , and took hold of his ears with her hands . " Maybe . To other people . And maybe they were scared too . ' Let go my ears ! I know my business , ' " he quoted . " Anyway I guess it 's not just the world that 's the woods . It 's the fucking Universe , " he said , and rubbed his lips deliciously in the delicious sweat on her chest . " Do n't think , " she said . " Drink . " He had glanced up and seen her smiling . It could have been her philosophy . In fact it was . When Rocky Graziano 's ghosted book had come out way back with its horrible title designed for the consumption trade  --  for the assholes ' , as the Madison Avenue boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted it to her own : to real : " Somebody up there hates me . " It made the rounds from P. J. Clarke 's to El Morocco , but she really meant it . She was determined to extract every fleeting joy , beauty , pleasure from her life that she could get before ( : od or wli ; tevcr Monster it was Up There snatched it away from her . She bud ako twisted for her own benefit Spinoza 's " Because I love God does not mean Cod must love nee in return " to fit more the modern age : " Be-  | cause God hates me does not mean I must love God in return . " She also said : " The reason there is so much divorce in America today is because sex is not dirty enough in the home . " " Grant found it all not only sane but encouraging . Especially after his Middlewestern mistress 's crazy occultism and yakking about moral responsibility . Because what Lucky said was really the way he felt about the world , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Responsibility to whom ? The inhuman race ? Grant 's youthful naivete about the importance of literature had long since disappeared , buried and suffocated to death by the new age 's avalanche of mass media propagandas and the people it created . The bureaucracy of Madison Avenue . But when he used it back on her , Lucky surprised him again . " People like you have to write literature , " she said in a sturdy way . Grant mocked her . " Yeah ? For who ? The race ? " Sturdily , she would n't back down . " For me , " she said staring him straight in the eye . After a while she added , " Anyway , you ca n't help it anyway . " He had met her the way he met all of his New York girls . Some friend who liked them and wanted to do you a favor , usually a friend who had laid them in the past , arranged for a polite and proper introduction and then you were on your own . In the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hervey Miller the critic 's house in the East 6os . This was pretty drastic for a playwright even though Miller liked his work and had always given him good reviews , but the Miseries had tied him up in knots . He had spent the long New Year 's weekend in Connecticut with his friend Frank Aldane the novelist and his family , where he had laid an aging lady novelist who lived around there . No score . A good sweat but no score . Neither of them really cared . Then , back in the city , he had finally made it with the second of the two new secretaries his producer 's office had acquired since Grant 's last trip East . Again no score . All very friendly but no real score . He had n't called her again . And so here he was at Hervey Miller 's house all alone at five o'clock for a drink . And then Buddy Landsbaum had wandered in . Buddy was a slightly older competitor in the theater , and at the moment was collaborating with Hervey Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was giving a party that very night in his hotel suite , a farewell party for the cast and crew of his last film . It was just the kind of party for a lonely writer , Buddy said when he heard about Grant 's predicament from Hervey . But as it turned out , it was n't . The five or six young chicks were there , as Buddy 'd promised , but they were all interested in Buddy . They were all movie actresses and Buddy had just made one girl a  | star and gotten her a Life cover . The young star herself , who was present , worked hard and carefully to protect her interests . Slowly the five or six chicks wandered off and left  --  without Grant . They all knew his name of course but he had never done any film , and they wanted film . Then the young star 's husband came and collected her from Buddy . So after the last drunken technician left , Buddy and Grant sat down in the debris with the remnants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really know each other well . Buddy was always off in Hollywood or South America or Florida , Grant was always home in Indianapolis with his unknown ( but suspected ) mistress ' . Buddy it turned out was having his troubles too . His second wife was costing him so much to divorce that he might not ever be able to marry again  --  even should he ever want to . In addition , her dress shop in Miami Beach had failed and he was having to absorb that . The young star he had made , and whom Grant had met tonight , was already beginning to dally her next producerdirector , for her next film . When the whiskey was gone , they went to bed . What was the point of Grant going back alone to the New Weston ? It was in the morning , after they 'd started off with orange juice and vodka , that Buddy thought of Lucky . Lucky Videndi . " I do n't know if I ought to introduce you to her , though , " Buddy said after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone . He put the phone back in its cradle . " You 're one of those rough-tough brutal he-man types , and she 's a very sophisticated , sensitive girl . " Grant grinned . He knew that a lot of people thought of him in that way , but he knew enough real he-man ' types to know that this opinion of him was comparative , very comparative . " Cut the shit , " he said , " I 'm no more of a brutal he-man type than you or anybody is . " " Well , you 're not the type I  --  or Lucky either  --  would think of as a very hip , Ivy-League New Yorker . " " Aw , come on . Then what 'd you suggest her for ? Okay , then do n't call her . And go to hell . " 13nddy had a peculiar but very common look on his face . It was the look of a man who has screwed a girl and is vain of it and wants everyone to know , hilt at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say so or tell . his evelnows registered smugness , a little embarrassment and some hal , rin , all : 1t the same time . " I do n't know how to explain it to you , Ron . But she 's a very special type of girl , She 's not like most of the kids you and I run into in town . Hell , 1 could have put her into a couple of my films , groomed her a little , and mule her a star hilt she said to hell with that . She thinks all actors and ueltesses ; oe esluhtltooI ( and snlpi ( l insensitive egos. "  | " She 's right , " Grant put in . " So she works for us a little every now and then , in bit parts or doubling or as script girl , whenever she needs money . She 's got her Master 's in Political Philosophy . Her old man was the biggest bootlegger in upper New York State in the ' zos and made a fortune . So she 's ... ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of genuine puzzlement now , one which he had unintentionally talked himself into . " She just had a rich young South American she was going to marry shot out from under her , so to speak , down there . You know the South Americans . That was a year ago . She 's been working on a play since then . I do n't know if it 's good . She wo n't talk about it . She 's been very low since her boyfriend got knocked off , says she 's looking for a new relationship . I ... " Buddy stopped again , and scratched his rumpled head , a different , deeper kind of puzzled chagrin on his face now . " Well , I called her up and tried to get back in with her , " he said , " but she does n't want any part of me anymore . Says she 's had me , up to here . That way . We 're still friends , she still works for us sometimes , but that 's it . " He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his belly out from all the late nights and boozing . " This is all in the strictest confidence , Ron . But I had to tell you . " " Okay okay , " Grant said . He suddenly felt sorry for old Buddy , who had not done a play in ten years now . " So call her or do n't call her . " " And she 's very beautiful , " Buddy added . He drank off another half a glass of orange juice and vodka and then went back to the telephone . After he had talked to her awhile , he put Grant on . The voice , coming through the instrument , sounded husky with a shy edge of wit and laughter just under the surface . She also sounded rather embarrassed , as if she were trying hard not to think of this call and introduction as a form of male procurement . After looking at Buddy , and receiving an affirmative nod , Grant gently and as charmingly as he could made a date with her that night . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the liquor store and the only tenement on Park Avenue , she said . " I just did you the biggest favor I could ever do you , " Buddy said sadly as he hung up , and then carried him off to Faye Emerson 's house around the corner where he pushed drinks on him all afternoon , then took him to a cocktail party way downtown with Buddy 's own date , all of it as if now that he 'd introduced him he was trying to get him drunk enough and make him late enough so that Grant would miss the date . When he did arrive , he was forty-five minutes late and more than a little drunk , thanks to Buddy . But he had been emotionally turned on at the cocktail party by a goodlooking girl who wanted to make him ( was n't it  | always that way ? either drought or flood ) , and he could feel his not inconsiderable charm working in him like a smoothly purring welltuned engine . ( Ah , if he could only turn it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of narrow stairs in the tiny building , he knocked and was admitted to a delegation of four girls , three of whom seated on the couch were obviously there to look him over . The prettiest of the four , who had opened the door , put her hand out and smiling nervously said , " Hello , I 'm Lucky . You 're kind of late . For a first date . " He apologized . " I very nearly did n't make it at all , by God ! " he added . " I think Buddy was deliberately trying to get me drunk and make me late . So you 'd be mad at me . " " I guess he 's not above it , " she said , her smile still nervous . Buddy had told him she was beautiful . But that had not prepared him for the kind of breathtaking beauty he found himself facing . All he could think was , It 's unfair , it 's unfair ! It very nearly choked off and killed his smoothly purring charm . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounded forehead in a sort of lion's-mane effect . She had high slightly prominent cheekbones that slanted her eyes the least tiniest bit . But beneath the short straight nostrilflaring nose , her mouth was her most attractive feature . It was wide enough that it seemed to go all the way across her face although it did n't , and the full sweet upper lip was so unusually short that it appeared unable to cover a perfect set of prominent upper teeth except by an act of conscious will on the part of its owner . Below the long full lower lip was a tiny cute jaw and chin that further accentuated the mouth . When she smiled with it , even nervously like now , it not only lit up the entire little apartment but appeared to radiate right on through the walls into the apartments around . It was typical of Lucky , Grant learned later , that she should consider her Italian nose her best feature and be embarrassed about that exquisite mouth . But apart from her face , her figure was enough to drive men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her body 's beauty in words , even to himself . It had something to do with the unusual width and squareness of the shoulders , and the long line which tapered down from them to the waist , to flare immediately into a pair of gorgeous , unusually higlurssecl hips ; and perhaps because above this width of shoulder rode the slender neck and high small head of a princess . Actually , she needed the wide shoulders to support the big full globes of her breasts thrusting out in the tight black dinner dress . Her calves were perfect , and ended in strong dclic ate aristocrat 's ankles and the powerful feet of a pro dancer , which it turned out later , she had been . In the tight dress there was suggrtded just n hint of an equally powerful rnons vencris . In her heels she  | was just a hair shorter than Grant , and she stood very straight , carrying her torso high off her hips , the slender neck extended to carry the small head , in the manner of a Jamaican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved the same way . And icing all this cake together , another indescribable quality , a reserved sexuality oozed from her like her very own invisible honey . She was obviously the doted-upon darling of the three girls on the couch , to whom she now began to introduce Grant . Grant was totally bowled over , but he managed to acknowledge the introductions . He had been out with several coldly professional beauties over the years , but this girl was far and away the most beautiful woman he had ever met , and this included a few very famous female movie stars . It would take him several days to separate the names of the three girls on the couch . But he had always been bad at names anyway . Leslie Green was Lucky 's roommate in the apartment . A small , pert girl with a good figure in crotch-tight green slacks , raven hair piled up high on her head to make her look taller , and a long haunted Jewish face perhaps a tenth as beautiful as her pal 's , she was obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Leader of the Delegation to Study Grant . Her snapping black eyes stated unequivocally that she was not about to let Lucky not be appreciated . Grant felt that her eyes softened a little after she looked him over . Mrs Athena Frank was a blocky blonde girl with a square face somewhat marred by acne and a rather gracelessly lush , sensual figure . The introductions turned up the fact that she was a lawyer and Grant wondered uneasily if she were the official legal member of the team , the committee . Her open and belligerent hostility showed already , anyway , which way she would vote on the subject of Ron Grant , playwright . Mrs Annie Carler was a slender , fairly tall Jewish girl of about Grant 's own age , with short tousled black hair and lushly dissipated circles under her eyes , much given to unconscious posturings of her long pretty neck and slender back into modern-dance , Martha Graham poses . With a sly puckish grin , she seemed to be enjoying the situation very much and appeared to be the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly madly in love with Lucky , her wit and her beauty ; and if there were any hidden jealousies in all this anywhere , Grant could not yet smell them out . If she had a big reputation going in Manhattan , and apparently she did , these three were going to promulgate it . And like any real queen , Lucky treated her subjects with dignity , and with a deep respect for their good taste in serving her . There was some small talk  --  in which Grant did not feel he came off particularly brilliantly  | ? then she got her coat and they whisked out the door and down the four flights of narrow badly lit stairs out onto the nocturnal glories of Park in a winter snowfall . Rich people in dinner clothes and furs were getting into Cadillac limousines and taxis all around them . " Well , do you think I passed inspection ? " Lucky gave him a sly crooked grin that made her blue eyes glint . " I think so . " She looked at him squarely . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say more . In the cab , glancing at her sideways , as she nestled that nosey , toothy , short-upper-lipped profile down into the collar of her coat , Grant realized with a start that he had never before in his life been so proud to be seen in public with a woman . And , especially after these past two years of hibernation and work in Indianapolis , with his mistress and his new play , it made his heart jump . In the past he had often looked with envy at the escorts of unknown , real beauties  --  of which there were few enough in this world , known or unknown ? the kind which made heads turn and tables buzz . Now he was escorting one himself . Settling back , he told himself this might turn out to be one of the great nights of his life . It did n't . Though it started out well enough . He took her to the Petite Ange , haven of the sick comics after they graduated from Max Gordon 's Village Vanguard , for dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and lost her nervousness and began to display that really penetrating wit , humor , and incredibly sexy charm Buddy Landsbaum had told him about . She was apparently an incorrigible flirt . But then , she was also so beautiful , so sexually attractive that for her simply to look at a man was enough . Grant had never sat in a nightclub so proudly , so self content . Heads turned toward her , tables buzzed . The only trouble was that as she loosened up after a few drinks , Grant after a few drinks became quite drunk . All the drinks his old pal Buddy had pushed on him all day long , which drinks and other chicanery he had survived to keep his date , now began to catch up with him . The dinner and all that good food in his belly lived him for a while , but after the show they came back out to the I nu1ge bar in listen to the colored fag piano player and drink and talk . , uc l , V Vcs a little drunk herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : suit made his bitch for her there in the lounge-bar . With sly drunken shit wdlic'ss Ill ' li , ul decided not to do it during the dinner and show inside . ' i'uu many distracting elements around . But you could talk while the fag piano player was playing ; he was background . And he played a lot of love mood music , when he was n't doing his funny numbers . So Grant had waited .  | He had of course been making love to her as politely and charmingly as he could all during the dinner and show inside . Now for the clincher ! The essence of his pitch was that he wanted her to come back to his suite in the New Weston with him , or , if her roommate did n't mind , since he had noticed a sofa bed in the livingroom as well as twin beds in the tiny bedroom , he would be quite willing to go back to her apartment with her . Either way , he said , he intended to make violent love to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . He had expected , especially after all his old pal Buddy had told him about her , that the result would be a foregone conclusion . He was astonished and shaken when she told him no . " But my God ! Why not ? " he cried . " What 's wrong with me ? " He then discovered he had very nearly drowned out the piano player , who , being an old acquaintance from bachelor nights when the lonely Grant used to come in here and drink alone , looked over at him and winked . Lucky had a hurt , embarrassed , but sturdy look on her face . " How do I know what 's wrong with you ? I do n't even know you yet . " She shook her pretty head and said flatly , " I never lay men the first date I have with them . " " But that 's ridiculous ! " Grant protested . During dinner she had been open and quite frank about all the men she had had in her life , though without naming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though Grant suspected her of exaggerating to shock him , and now the thought of going back alone to that miserable suite in the New Weston after being titillated and heated up so by this exquisite female was enough to nearly unman him . Had he been more sober , he might have hidden it better . " That 's . . . That 's the same kind of rigid moral rule you hate the middleclass bourgeoisie for , " he protested , lamely . What he wanted to say but had n't the courage was If all 400 of them , why not me too ? Lucky still looked embarrassed , and stubborn . " Well , maybe . But I do n't care . I do n't have to . And I wo n't . " Then her eyes softened a little . " Anyway , you 're getting pretty drunk . " " That 's our goddam friend Buddy ! " Grant cried waving his arm , and several people turned to look at him . He had been sweating all night in this smoky , overheated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his excitement . " And because I 'm shy ! " In an effort to calm him Roddy Croft the piano player had begun to play the famous , very popular theme from the film of Grant 's first play . Lucky was blushing . " People are looking at us . " " Hell with them ! " Grant said . " Sons of bitches ! What do they know about loneliness ? "  | " What do you know about it ? " Lucky said sharply . " I think you 're nothing but a ? " Grant started , but he could n't bring himself to finish it , so he came at it from behind . " I hate cockteasers , " he muttered . " And I think you 're a boor ! " Lucky said . " No girl would lay a man with such a rude , crude approach as yours ! " They were joined by the club 's PR man , another old drinking companion from bachelor nights , who offered to buy a drink . He knew Lucky too , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the joint over the years . Grant thought to appeal to him , but wisely thought better of it . Instead , he began to brood . The PR man bought several drinks . And that was the way it ended . His first date with Lucky Videndi . Nothing he could say would shake her . When they left at nearly four in the morning , Saul Weiner the PR man went with them , and Grant made his grand climax of the evening . The light snow had stopped and as they walked up Park toward Lucky 's place Grant began to kick over the wickerwire wastepaper baskets along Park Avenue in furious , frustrated , outraged protest . " That 's against the law , " Lucky told him nervously . " It really is . They 're very serious about it . You 're liable to get picked up for it . " " Yeah ? I hope I do ! I hope by God I do ! " he said and kicked over another . At her door she shook hands with him . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sort of awed whisper , " I really think you 're crazy ! You 're a savage goof-off from the goddamned Middlewest ! " " You think so , huh ? " Grant said . For one clear moment , one clear agonized moment that would forever stay burned in his head , he stared at her . Out from behind and beyond his large alcoholic haze , piercing into and through her smaller alcoholic haze , he tried to put into his eyes all that he really felt about her , and about himself , and shit , and about everything . Ile thought he saw that her eyes understood . But she was very : uiirv. ' ! ' hen the cold dark New Weston suite closed its cloud back down ovet hiin and he turned away . Four hundred men ! And she would n't even let him feel her titty ! With the quiet , cynical Saul Weiner he walked to lteIihen 's , where lie ate tartar steak he did not want and talked about things that bored him . When he staggered into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found a telegram from his mistress ' who was at the moment in Miami Beach , which coldly demanded to know why her phone calls could never find him in and why lie had not called or answered her wires . It was the third such in two days .  | It also said that her husband would be joining her in a few days . Grant wadded it up and threw it on the floor . But he knew that once he sobered up the incredible , horrible , sickmaking panic-guilt she was somehow able to instill in him would return . Carol Abernathy . And Hunt Abernathy , her husband . Grant could not say now , at this late date , which one of them he had really liked the best over the years . Carol Abernathy . Wife of Hunt Abernathy . Head and primemover of the Hunt Hills , Indianapolis , Little Theatre . And also one of Indianapolis 's most highly successful real estate agents . When he was undressed and nude , and had with drunken care hung his clothes up neatly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in it on the floor of the suite 's livingroom . This made him feel some better . The hard floor felt good . The double bed in the bedroom had a soft mattress and on top of that one of those European-type featherbed comforters . The whole damn thing suffocated him , and he had taken to sleeping in the same spot on the livingroom floor with the blanket whenever he was here alone . Also , that way , he did not have to think so much about the other half of the double bed being empty . He was lonely and panicky for so famous a man . Drunk in his blanket , he did some reviewing . Up to the age of thirty-six , which was now , Ron Grant had never had what he considered a true love affair . As a result , he had come to believe no such thing existed  --  except in the movies of Clark Gable and Carole Lombard ; and in that insane , complex , all-pervasive spiderweb laid down over the entire American nation : the great American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had been considerably aided in this belief by his mistress , who for reasons of her own never tired of stating it : There is no such thing as love . Grant had for a long time strongly suspected that her reasons were entirely personal : if she could convince him there was no love anywhere else either , she could bind him that much more closely to her , because what would be the point of leaving her ? She never let up on it . And he had to admit that up to now the theory had been just about ioo percent accurate . Long and seriously deep were the philosophical discussions they had had about it . However , he had been brainwashed like the rest of his generation by the great American love song industry , and he could n't stop looking , stop hunting . His mistress ' considered this ( and sometimes he agreed ) a sin of ignorance . But he could no more stop hunting love than he could stop wanting to get laid well , which she considered a sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting and wanting over their fourteen years . He had done a deal of hunting before that , for that matter . A great , great deal . All he wanted was to have just once in his life one love affair that was like those accursed Clark Gable  --  Carole Lombard films of his youth , that was all . He did n't even care if it lasted . After it , he would accept all torment ? all the consequences , all the penalties , all the misery . There were , in all , three love affairs he had had in his life . Innumerable liaisons ; but only three love affairs , and not one of them a true one . The first two did n't even count really , since he had never fucked either of the girls . One was a girl in school , high school , when he was still too green to believe girls liked doing it ; she turned out a lesbian . The second was a big , lushly built , redhead Irish-American girl in Hawaii when he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any closer to than the grinding of his forearm on the outside of her dress against her enticingly protuberant mops veneris ; she now had four kids . Neither counted . And then the third : his long , By God fourteen years long , affair with Carol Abernathy . He supposed he had to count that one , since it had lasted so long . But it had certainly never been a true one , a Clark Gable  --  Carole Lombard one . As for the liaisons , both before and during Carol Abernathy , some had been good and some had been not so good . But none could be called love affairs . A love affair , Grant had decided some time back , presupposed a need , an allpowerful , insuperable need  --  and not just an insuperable , but a happily insuperable one  --  for whatever weak , insecure reasons  --  of each party for the other which superseded everything else in life . And if that happily surrendered-to need was n't there , it could n't be a love affair , only a liaison . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that was as far as he could take it at the age of thirty-six . Carol Abernathy . Hunt Abernathy . When he had come home from the Navy and the war to finish school and write plays , he had thought the Abernathys both very glamorous . The Hunts ( from whom the Hunt Hills suburb got its name , as had Hunt Abernathy himself ) and the Abnernatlns h : , ( l been in Indiana since the days of Mad Anthony Wayne .

Easy to swallow , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tit Cher irony that her name happened to be Carol . ) torn into a poor Tennessee hills family who had moved north , she had met IIunt in high school . Later  --  so Grant got the story from her ( he had  | never talked of it with Hunt ! ) ? with him at college in Bloomington and her working as a waitress downtown , he had knocked her up , paid for her abortion after which she nearly died of infection , and then , when more or less honorably freed , had come back around and , because of some peculiar tortured sense of chivalric masochism of his own perhaps , had married her . She had been tolerated but never accepted by his family and his country club , where she became known as The Madcap Carol because of doing crazy stunts . He had never been true to her . Having boundless energy , she had contented herself with the social life , fashion and gay parties , but never felt she quite made it . She had had three or four affairs around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married doctor , the rest always with younger men who were poorer than she and whom she helped to get started in some business . Then she discovered literature and the theater , began trying to write plays , and organized the Hunt Hills Little Theatre . Hunt became the best golfer in Indianapolis if not in Indiana , general manager of the biggest brick making and lumber yard establishment in the area , loved cars , fucked many waitresses and other lowclass girls , and settled into being a serious heavy drinker . When Grant entered the picture  --  though they went out together in public and gave gay parties at home ? ( she said ) they had n't slept together for years and Hunt had once seriously threatened to commit her . It was such a banal story that it would n't even make a novel or a play . Grant 's entrance into it had not made it any less banal . He knew of at least twenty childless couples scattered over the Petit Middlewest who had adopted ' a broke young artist or writer , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fucking the mistress of the establishment at the same time . About the only un-totally-predictable thing , which perhaps saved the story from total banality , was that Ron Grant through fate , luck , talent or all three , had becomeaa worldfamous playwright . That , and the fact that Carol Abernathy , as she watched the years of Grant 's and her ages mount together , began more and more to study oriental philosophies . It was four years after their affair started that Carol Abernathy began to frequent occult book stores . Their physical love affair ( never very fulfilling sexually because after a very short time she would only do it one way , in one position ) had rapidly waned as she occupied herself more and more with the spiritual side of things . It was true that Grant had started having other women soon after their affair started ( to be exact , one week after she started refusing to have him  | in more than one way , one position ) but even so he could not believe he was totally responsible for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that he was , that it was his fault ' . Through her occult studies she deduced that she had been appointed a sort of occult Master of Midwestern Artists , doomed by some unknown Karma to the great sacrifice of aiding Creators while herself never being allowed the opportunity to create because of helping them . Under this concept her dictatorial tendencies emerged swiftly , since her sacrifice gave her the moral right to know what was best for more self-indulgent people . She made it plain to Grant that she now slept with him only so that he would not waste precious time from his Art chasing pussy . She even went so far as to tell him that a frustrated sex life was good for him , and all artists , all great men , because it allowed him  --  and them  --  to sublimate sex energy in work . And Grant at one point in his life with her believed , or tried to believe , it . After all there was a lot of truth in the idea . Look at Gandhi . And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which understood people surely but wordlessly , as would some languageless super-animal , knew it all to be a web of selfish , self-laminating , ego-perpetuating lies on her part . All she really wanted was to keep him like any woman wanted to keep any man , keep him and dominate him , be boss , make him pay . He knew all this and yet he did n't leave her . Rolled in his blanket on the hard floor of the suite 's livingroom , Grant groaned in his half-sleep . Carol Abernathy . Their first four months , most of which time they were separated anyway because Grant was still in the Naval Hospital at Great Lakes Station and still totally flat broke , was the nearest they came to a love affair . Using her husband 's money , she used to meet him in Chicago and stay with him . Only some time later did he actually move in with them in Indianapolis , begin writing original one-acters for her Little Theatre , and allow himself to be supported by Hunt . This was after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his GI Bill ran out on brio because he had only had his senior year left to do . She had visited him there too on Ilunt 's money , from time to time . But after that , having moved in with them in Indianapolis , instead of a love affair ( even a bad or ) it ire i:nne like some crazy kind of unhappy marriage , with Grant not evert h ; iving Ole public distinction of being anyone 's husband . t : awl : AIu r1latliv laid him small sums of I-lunt Abernathy 's money for the one inlets . This with his tiny Navy pension gave him a little beer and pool money whenever he went out with the boys . But he was seldom allowed to by Carol , who could always threaten to throw him out , and  | sometimes did . For the rest  --  bed , board , books , cigarettes  --  Hunt Abernathy paid . Grant could never understand why . Except that he knew why . Hunt put up with her for the very same reason he himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a particularly manly way to live for Grant , and his status could conceivably be termed gigolo or rich lady 's darling . Later on , of course , after his first big three-acter became such a colossal hit on Broadway , it was a lot harder for her to hold him down . He had to go to New York quite a lot . Carol Abernathy never went with him , though out of politeness he asked her once or twice . She always refused . Neither did Hunt go , who could n't because of his job , and who did n't give a good goddam about New York anyway . And each time Grant went to Europe , he went alone . But why did he always come back ? When the big money began to come in , Carol Abernathy found for him ( in her other capacity as real estate agent ) an expensive home right across the street from their own in Hunt Hills . What was more , she got him to buy it . Grant was aware that  --  in addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind , as she told him  --  it also tied up a big chunk of his sudden new income . And yet he went ahead and did it . But of course at the time he had wanted to do it . Further , Carol Abernathy got him to invest an even greater sum ( over $75,000 to be precise , and most of it non-deductible ) in the building of a brand-new theater and grounds for the Hunt Hills Little Theatre . By now , due largely to Grant 's first big success , the Hunt Hills Little Theatre had quite a little group of would-be artists , novelists , playwrights , designers and actors grown up around it . The new theater , grounds and living quarters caused an exciting little Arts Renaissance in Indianapolis . But Grant also knew that besides being for Art and the good of Art and that he owed it to Art because he 'd been lucky , as Carol Abernathy told him ( and as he himself believed , for that matter ) , the new Hunt Hills Little Theatre tied up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went ahead and did that too . But he had wanted to do that , too . He allowed her to go on saying in public that he owed it to her , for helping him . Why ? That was nine years ago . And so far his share of all spiritual profits had been , simply and solely , guilts  --  newer and bigger and profounder guilts : guilt as unfaithful lover , guilt as ungrateful son , guilt as commercially successful artist , guilt as a man who kept on repeatedly cuckolding his friend . My God , talk about Oedipus !  | As Carol Abernathy in one of her better moments once chuckled and said huskily as they lay in bed , " Christ ! You 're the only man I ever heard of who got to live out his Oedipus complex ! " Grant had laughed , at the time . They began seriously the foster-mother routine for the first time when Life Magazine sent one of its hot-shot young feature writers out to Indianapolis to do an article on the hick playwright from some Indiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit since A Streetcar Named Desire , and on the " strange Middlewestern housewife " who " dominated the Group like a dictator " and " ran the Group 's affairs like a general " . How they ever managed to fool the smart young Life Yale man Grant did n't know , but he suspected it was because not even a Yale man could believe a grown man who was fucking some woman would allow himself to be so bossed , so tonguelashed , and so ordered around by her . But that was exactly his reason , once he allowed himself to be convinced by Carol that they seriously had to play mother and son or be found out , which  --  after all  --  would really hurt nobody but Hunt . Naturally , the Life article made him look like a raving fag to the world . And from then on he was trapped in the role . A ' mother ' - dominated neurotic . His intention had been to protect Carol and I-Iunt  --  especially Hunt , who had come to be the biggest of his guilts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other choice . Either he shut up and let himself be a fag mother 's boy to the world , or he told the truth and showed up his friend Hunt Abernathy as a cuckold  --  and , one made so by himself . Grant never did know what Hunt thought about the whole thing . Whenever they two were together alone , they reacted and talked as though the Life article was right and they three were a family with Carol the mother , Hunt the father , and Grant the son  --  which , in one strange way , they really were . Only once did Hunt even obliquely mention anything about the whole business and that was one time several years after Grant 's success when , after a terrible lovers ' fight with Carol , Grant had gone out and got drunk and Hunt  --  not too sober himself  --  had come to find Iiinz and bring him home . They two , both males  --  or both trying to be males ? had over the years formed an oddly deep , enduring friendship itonz opposite sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not ) that neither should ever be a man again . I ) 11% ing along the darkened streets of downtown Indianapolis , lit only by the neon of bars at this late hour , Hunt Abernathy had said , " Listen , I do n't know what this light 's all about . But I want you to know that , much us I 've mute to like you , even love you , Icon , if it ever conies to a head-on  | collision , a head-on break between you and Carol , I 'll have to side with Carol . " ? " Sure , " Grant had said in a pained , subdued voice , " of course . " ? " Because I think she 's right , " Hunt Abernathy said . " I believe in her . " How had she managed it ? It was incredible . For years she had governed her every act by a double-edged policy of declaring herself arbiter morum over the lives of her husband and lover in order to help ' them , and also in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . For years she had labored  --  whether deliberately or not  --  to instill sufficient guilt in them to bind both to her forever . She had succeeded , apparently . And yet of course it had n't all been bad . Maybe that was the trouble . Despite everything else , human loyalties had grown  --  caused simply by the guilts , perhaps . Grant could recall the time the three of them had gone out together and celebrated his first sale of a Grant one-acter outside the Hunt Hills Little Theatre ; some little summer theater in upstate New York had wanted to do it . When the first big hit came , he had taken the two of them on a month 's vacation in Havana . What a time they had had . Hunt had caught a marlin . On the floor of the room in the New Weston Hotel the rolled-up figure groaned again . If he could only just once find one Carole Lombard . For one week . He would throw it all up , throw away everything , success , money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he always come running back to Carol Abernathy ? Fear , that was why . Fear of being alone . Fear that every girl in his life from now on would only be a liaison ; and that kind of bonecold loneness he could not face . Terrorized and haunted and made cowardly by such thoughts , he preferred to run back to a little love which if it did not keep you really warm , at least did not let you quite freeze . Grant , half waking , remembered the crumpled-up telegram . The reason Carol Abernathy was in Miami Beach visiting friends and on her way to Jamaica was because during the two years he had worked on his new play Grant had decided he wanted to learn skindiving . Reading M. Cousteau 's book had started him off . He bought himself a little aqualung at his sports dealer 's , dove down thirty-five or forty feet into two murky Indiana lakes , saw nothing , and came back home with a serious external ear infection which it took six weeks to cure . Indiana just was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on diving . And from diving he branched out into marine biology , underwater archeology , oceanography , marine geology . Sitting in his relatively safe vantage point of Indianapolis Indiana watching via newspapers he did not trust the three colossal bureaucracies of the world wrassling each other for  | moral superiority and threatening each other with retaliatory destruction ' , he studied the last frontier open to the individual , non-team man . He was writing a play about a languishing fourteen-year-old love affair which his agent , producers and director told him was almost certain to be a smash hit , and into which he was trying to put some sense of serious meaning of what it was like to live in his own terrified , terrorized time , and what that time itself was like when Presidents and Leaders and parliamentary bodies , and the vast anonymous bureaus and groups of bureaus their governments had created , could not influence  --  and could not even be held responsible for  --  what was happening to the world . He promised himself that when he finished it , hit or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn this new world where it ought to be learned , in the tropics . At least it would be an antidote to world politics for six months or so . It would also be an antidote to Carol Abernathy . He told Hunt and Carol about it over dinner one evening in his house , in Indianapolis . This made it an occasion , because usually he dined with them . Carol liked the idea . She liked it so much she immediately invited herself and took over the planning , suggesting Ganado Bay in Jamaica because they could stay with the Countess Evelyn de Blystein , who was the former Evelyn Glotz of Indianapolis before with her father 's huge coal fortune she married the Count Paul , and whom they all had known for years and whom Carol and Hunt had twice visited in her Jamaican winter home . She would write her a letter tomorrow . The play would be finished in a matter of weeks , and they could leave before the real cold weather started . Grant listened to all of this and said nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Abernathys , after Carol finished with them  --  were that she would spend some days with friends in Miami and , leaving her Mercedes there , would then go on to Ganado Bay where she would stay with Evelyn de Blystein and where Grant after seeing his producers in New York would meet her , and where Hunt would join them for the six weeks of his annual vacation . Then , at their leisure ( whatever the lull that meant , Grant thought sourly , because it was her phrase ) , they two would continue on to Kingston where he would take diving lessoo , s front I ' : urolx  --  an professional named Georges Villalonga he had read ah.iut and thus begin his diving career . I II film ' Olt of the diving excited Grant , but the thought of Carol Aberoaths ' being there did not . Why then could he not tell her this ? explain to lu r that he wanted , preferred to go alone ? IIe could n't . Ilia ladylove left first , driving her own little Mercedes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly across the street from the house she had found for Grant to buy . ( It required only a moment for him to slip across the street late at night , after Hunt was asleep ; as long as he was always back in his own house some time before daylight . And Grant had always enjoyed being up at dawn . ) With some part of all this in his mind he stood in her yard with Hunt as she left , waving . As she pulled away , she gave him a secret tender loving look , which lit up her dark brown eyes , and which also Grant noticed accentuated the petulant jowls on her jawline that she had been steadily acquiring over the past six or eight years because she felt he did not love her and because she was aging . Then he went back across the street and spent five days going over the typescript of his new play one last time with a pencil , adding a word here , cutting one there , relishing reading over one more time his own finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now he had believed in despair would never be finished . There was always this sad feeling that once a play was done , and seen by the public , it was no longer his and he had lost it . Then he packed a bag and , after a last drunken evening with Hunt , left for the train possessed of a violent desire to get the hell out of Indianapolis and back to New York and quickly get laid , anxious to start living yet once again  --  which meant getting laid . Again the figure on the floor of the New Weston suite 's livingroom groaned . Laid ? Laid ? He was awakened by the desk clerk at eight-thirty with the information that there was a person-to-person call for him from Miami . He refused it , telling the clerk to say he was out , took a shower and shaved , and then , after hacking hard to get the cigarettes-and-whiskey huskiness out of his voice , picked up the receiver and called Lucky Videndi.  | SOME TIME LATER Lucky told him that that very huskiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only reason she had allowed him to continue to talk at all without hanging up on him immediately was because the husk in his phone voice was so sexy and exciting that it startled and intrigued her into listening . " That was my bad luck , " she grinned , running one hand lightly across his belly and then down into his crotch , kissing him in the center of his chest . " My good luck ! " Grant countered , and trapped her hand where it was with his own so she could n't remove it , or stop what it was doing . " And it turns out it was only cigarettes and whiskey ! " she smiled . Normally she did n't do things like that , grab him like that so often , and so Grant liked it . Usually she sort of waited , to be stimulated and then played upon , as though this was some woman 's passive prerogative she could avail herself of if she wished to . Grant sometimes felt she saw herself as some sort of flesh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that he himself was the harpist  --  a harpist ? who literally twanged these strings . Like any instrument she had to be warmed up ; then , warmed , she could be played upon , and Grant was dedicating himself to this art form . He had never had sex like this in his life , aver. *  | " Thanks ! " Lucky said sharply , then softened her voice . " But do n't you have anything more interesting than that to do today ? " Soft or not , there was a dangerous edge there , he thought . " No , nothing . I got a date for cocktails dinner and the theater for tonight is all . " This was the first of the two new secretaries in his producer 's office , the one he had not yet made because she first had stood him off and then departed on a January vacation . This date had been made before she left , and now Grant sincerely regretted it . " I 'm sorry about that , " he hemmed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that does n't matter , " the lovely low voice said airily . There was a pause . " Okay , come on over . I 'm not really doing anything . " Like the other remark , just before , this too could have been an ego ploy with an extra meaning , a little dig . But he was soon to learn that Lucky , incredibly , never said things like that . She always said simply and directly exactly what she meant , and so far from playing upon other people 's sensibilities with double-entendre she leaned the other way , almost too far , by ignoring sensibilities almost completely . For a man used to the bitcheries of the average Middlewestern country club woman , amongst whom his own mistress ' was a past master who would never give a phrase just one meaning if two or more were available , this was hard to believe and once believed harder still to get used to . For example she had met him at the door , looked him over and said simply but forcefully , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I do feel a little rocky , " Grant had grinned . " Some asshole drinking buddy called and woke me at eight-thirty . " He was nervously aware he had just told Lucky his first lie involving his mistress . " Well I was still in bed when you called , " she admitted smiling , quite clearly now aware of the lie , but then why should she be ? Anyway he did n't really care . Hell , not even his producers knew for sure about Carol Abernathy , although they might suspect what they wanted . Ile was n't about to tell of her to some girl he had just picked up . It was n't really the most auspicious beginning in the world , but Grant felt fine enough to weather that because something good had happened to him on the way over from the New Weston . He had decided to walk . It was only fifteen short blocks . And during the walk he had fallen in love again with New York , that was what had happened to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucky and by the time he had dressed , deodorized and scented himself for whatever might happen , it was almost noon . The sun  | had come out a little by the time he came out into the street , and while it was crisp it was n't that bonenumbing cold the town had lots of the time in winter . Girls with their bare heads tucked down into coat collars and young guys in their almost brimless hats and narrowshouldered topcoats were beginning to pour out of the midtown offices for the long lunch , and Grant suddenly wanted to holler . He passed by Random House where he knew some people and made a mental note to call . He loved and liked these sharp , smart Madison Avenue cats and chicks , though he detested and deplored just about everything any of them did for a living  --  as , he knew , most of them said they did too themselves . They only did it to live and love in this town . And who could blame them for that ? This town that was Number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole fucking world . The feeling stayed with him , brimming up out of his eyes and grin , all the way up Madison and over to Park of last night 's holocaust . He noted the wickerwire baskets were all put back , now . Actually he did n't know whether it was this mood that had him turned on and going so good , or whether it was some subtle essence extruding from under the exquisitely shaved armpits of Lucky . Maybe it was both . She had the ability to do that , to quietly and without pointing it somehow make a man feel more of a man than most of the time he was willing to believe he was . Whatever it was , he was male , vital , supersensitive , nearly omnipotent , gentle and because of it able to handle everything beautifully today . So naturally he was lying magnificently , about himself , about life , about work , about anything which contained no depression or fear or despair , which today was everything . Later he was to think back in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different that day , everything else might have been different too and he might never really have known her . IIer play was n't very much , and he told her this with a rather blunt honesty . Then it turned out she was rewriting it to trim down and Hemiugwayire the dialogue and it was the rewrite he was reading . When he asked for the old original , it turned out to be better but it still was n't very good , and he told her so . There were some fine ideas and two remarkable scene , in the first act ( which , shamefully , was as far as he got , and he did n't e e ii finish all of that ) . Mostly it was the style , and that extreme selfeonseionsness that came through and to which amateurs were so prone . lint he could n't really think about it much , or bother . He was too eaught up and enraptured by her , and by himself even being there with her I4rtcr , he not iced that while they talked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put it away . l k had boon caught up again breathless by her beauty , and swept by it  | as by some violent summer storm . The moment he stepped inside . She was wearing a tight fuzzy white sweater over those magnificent tits and tight brown slacks that molded into the crack of her ass all the way up . It was almost impossible to believe in that incredible rounded , flatwaisted , highhipped ass . Half the time he did n't know even what he was saying really , but it seemed to be working apparently . Finally they walked down to P. J. Clarke 's for a hamburger and beer lunch , and that was where it happened . Grant was good friends with all the waiters and guys who worked at Clarke 's , and the owner Danny , because this was another of his drunkenbachelor hangouts and they all waved and called out to him . But that could n't have had anything to do with it . Maybe it was the two or three other couples scattered around at tables in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing you into a closer intimacy , a neater rapport than you would have had at home in the apartment or on the street . That can happen sometimes . Anyway , over the hamburgers and two tall steins ( which Grant augmented with a large bowl of chili ) they were suddenly simpatico , together , a couple sealed against other couples , and finding they liked it . Grant talked until he almost missed his cocktail date , and had to leave her at Clarke 's and take a cab . He talked about himself with that freshness which only comes when one is with a new girl . All those things he had wanted to say about himself to someone for so long , but was too embarrassed . He talked about his life , his way of life , his new play , his earlier plays , about work in general , about his contemporaries and their work . He even talked about his ambitions , and whenever he mentioned Carol Abernathy and Hunt in talking about his life or way of life , he always referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this woman , Carol Abernathy ? " Lucky said once , her eyes glinting mischievously . " Are you her lover ? " ? Are you kidding ? " he said . " She 's old enough to be my mother . Actually . " But everything else was totally the truth . And Lucky 's warm eyes followed every gesture of his excited commitment and got warmer . When he put his hand over hers on the table to emphasize some point and then left it , she did not remove hers . Two days before he could not have talked to any girl like that , not without coughing and turning red . Later on he wondered about this sudden spurting spout of honesty and freshness from himself . It was as though it had been backed up there behind whatever dam , waiting for some key that would open the sluice gates and then it all just poured out . So he was not incapable of freshness and reality after all . He decided that it must be that it had to be seriously a new girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time when one is not attached or in love with somebody else . Otherwise it was a pose , a  | game on both sides , and was n't really fresh which made it stale and profitless . He had had that , too . But then . . . What the hell ? He still did n't understand . He was n't planning on marrying this girl Lucky . It was Lucky who made him realize the time by reminding him of his cocktail date . Outside Clarke 's there was only one cab around , and she made him take it . She could get home all right , she said . Pulling away from her standing there with those beautiful wide shoulders , Grant almost could n't stand it . If it had been anybody but his producer 's secretary , who was a sweet kid , he would have stood her up and gone back . As it was , all he could do was stick his head out and waving his arm shout over and over , " I 'll call tomorrow ! I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl standing there who was in love with him , or soon would be . It was on her face . What a body , and also what sweetness , she had . The marvel of the afternoon stayed with him all the rest of that day and the night , enhancing everything . In some peculiar odd way , almost before it even began to get itself started , he had divined that this was going to be the Clark Gable  --  Carole Lombard love affair he had always dreamed about . For the next two or three weeks he would be in town , before going back to Indianapolis and then on to Jamaica , he was going to show her such a time as few girls got to live even in this town . And after that , well she would be here and every time he came back to town he would look her up and take right up where they had left off . Maybe he could come to town oftener than he had in the past few years ? Grant was so happy that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel hollow for more than a moment . And the peculiar thing about the evening was that the producer 's secretary , after having stood him off several times before , tonight after her cocktails date dinner and show , sensing his preoccupation and disinterest , offered herself to him practically on a platter . It seemed nothing could go wrong for him , now . Then back at the hotel in the morning , scrubbing religiously from himself any sign of last night before even calling Lucky , the phone rang and without thinking he picked it Ill ) ; cucl answered it while still toweling himself . The result was that , while ! Lillie ; cttackecl him with sickness in the stomach and goosebumps on his 1 ' ; i flesh and the sweat began to run from under his arms down his hale Ise had to listen to a sharp , angry , virago , ten-minute lecture lronr t. : arid Abernathy in Miami on the subject of New York broads . Grunt was tempted several times to just hang up on her , but he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture . Naturally , cNifn guilt in his panic , lie became angry hack at her . But underneath all of Ns old stuff , way down deep , was a new steculf ; cstness in him . Totally  | selfishly , whether it hurt anybody or not and no matter what it destroyed , he was going to have his fun . " I know exactly what 's going on , you bastard , " Carol 's voice said clearly , sounding because of the excellent connection as if she were in the next room . Grant was immensely glad that she was not . " You 've found yourself some soft luscious pussycunt who is telling you how marvelous you are , what a great mind you 've got , what a great lover , what a great talent , what a great man . And you 're lapping it up . A piece of flufftail who would n't have looked at you before I made you rich and famous . It 's what you always do . Everytime you go . You weak pimp . " Grant did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half true those other times , what she said . It had n't always happened . It had n't ever happened  --  yet . " Hello ? " she said . " Hello ? " " Yes . " " Do n't you dare hang up on me , you son of a bitch , " she said . She waited . " Hunt is coming down soon . " How could all this shit she said sound so sane out in Indiana , and sound so ridiculous here in the New Weston ? " I said , Hunt 's coming down soon , " Carol said . Again she waited . " Then we 're going on to Ganado Bay . I want you to get your ass down here now , right away . " " I 'm not coming , " Grant said thickly . " What ? What ? What do you mean you 're not coming ? " " I 'm staying here . For  --  for an indefinite period . Couple of weeks . " " Then I 'm going without you ! " Carol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ringing from the broken circuit . Grant had sweat so much that he went in and took another shower , though he probably would n't have noticed it if he 'd had clothes on . Only then , after his hollow stomach and the nerves in his knees had settled down , did he feel up to calling Lucky . Whence this feeling all the time of getting caught , this fear of getting caught ? That same figure . It was always that same figure : black-clad , mantilla-ed , dark-hidden face , standing on the cathedral steps pointing . Carol Abernathy could n't do anything to him . If she had thought he would call her right back , she was wrong . The warm rich voice was like a kiss in his ear . And what little she said said everything , and Grant knew he had been right about her face yesterday . " Where 've you been ? " Lucky said . " I thought maybe since you did n't call you were on your way over already . " " I am now , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped off in some bar and had two quick , delicious martinis , savoring the quiet late-morning slack time of the bar , savoring the time he could afford to waste now , before going on to what he had waited for so long . It always seemed to Grant afterwards that their two naked bodies had met in the center of the room with a smack like the clap of two huge and irate , omnipotent God-hands summoning a recalcitrant Universal Waiter . But he knew that could n't be true . She had had clothes on he was sure , and he certainly had to be dressed , coming in from the outside as he was . So there must have been some conversation , if only to fill up the time required in getting clothes off . But he could n't remember . The most enduring image he had of that day was of himself lying on the livingroom couch and Lucky astraddle him and kneeling over his face , then drooping like some stricken flower with the champagne hair falling over her face almost to those beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It turned out that Lucky , either because of the way she was built or maybe it was psychological she admitted shyly , could have a real orgasm in only one way . And Grant , whose first play about a sailor 's love affair with a Honolulu whore was more autobiographical than generally supposed and who had learned his lovemaking in one of the toughest schools in the world , was her boy . He was oral-oriented if he was anything . This did not for her however injure her need of and liking for simple sexual intercourse , and so it was growing scratchy dark outside the windows when her roommate Leslie knocked discreetly on the apartment door . She did this because Lucky had taken the precaution of hanging a DO NOT DISTURB sign from the Beverly Hills Hotel on the doorknob outside . The knock came while they were eating , shortly after she had finished making scrambled eggs for them , standing nude in the dusk-painted , nearly dark apartment before the little two-burner hotplate of the efficiency kitchenette . " Wait a minute ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw something at Grant . " Here , put this on , Ron . " It was a man 's dressing relit , . I ? , , , king at it , ( : rant felt distinctly peculiar . It ! whinged to my South American boyfriend , ? Lucky said as if reading hi ' n , i , id . I Ir ' W ; IS .. 51allr  --  r than you , especially in the shoulders , but you ran get into , it . " ' Then she went to the door . ' 1 ) 1 , 1 ? ! I . r tilit said as she came in in her brusque shortstepping little walk . ' I n .1 st  --  I , I , r  --  d . " Nlv God , this place smells like the Bronx zoo ! ? " Go to hell , " 1 , 11 , k v said . Then she turned slowly , that sun-bright , wall-  | penetrating ( and now beatific ) smile Grant had noticed before shining on her face , stretching herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that you two have been making it together with each other while I have been spending the day in the office breaking my brains . " She threw off her coat and slumped in the one big chair . " Well , it 's only what I might have expected after the ' way she talked last night . You be good to her , you hear ? " " I intend to be , " Grant said . " Hello , Leslie . " " He 's built like a Greek god , " Lucky reported . " A regular Greek god ! " " Yes ? " said Leslie . " You 'd never know it to look at him dressed . We 've got to see about getting him some decent clothes . " " I am not currently up on men 's shops , " Leslie said . " Instead of those hick Indiana suits with the padded shoulders that he wears . " " Listen , now wait a minute , " Grant said . " I bought that suit at Broadstreet 's on Fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoying himself more than he could remember in a very long time . Maybe ever . " Then they saw you coming , " Lucky said . " I think I am forced to agree , " Leslie said . " Absolutely , " said Lucky . " You think so , hunh ? " he said . Grant grinned at her . Even though Leslie had come in Grant had hated seeing her put on the robe , cover up . Her body without clothes was even more incredibly beautiful than it was with clothes on it . The heavy beautiful slightly drooping breasts , that long lean line from armpit to the widely swelling hips , the high rounded bottom , the width of shoulder , not an ounce of age anywhere but not scrawny model-thin , not a bit of fat except perhaps the little delicious belly which was n't fat so much as the way she was constructed and which she called her " baby fat " , above the triangular bush on the protuberant Venus mound . And it was the most flexible female body Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put both feet behind her head at the same time if she wanted to . Grant sighed in the shoulder-tight dressing robe . Who was this South American guy , anyway ? Even now this late in the day and after so many times , he was n't sated and did n't want to quit . " I 'll have to take you somewhere tomorrow , " Lucky said . " For the clothes . 1 Lnmin . Where ? " " Not tomorrow , " Grant said . " I 've got a business lunch with my producer . Anyway , what I want to know is what are we doing tonight ? "  | " Whatever you want , " she said simply . " Have you got a date ? " she asked Leslie . Leslie shook her head from the deep chair . " This is one of my boyfriend 's nights with his wife , " she said ruefully . " Then why do n't I take the both of you out somewhere to dinner ? " Grant said . " Like Twenty-One or Voisin ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your style , you two , " Leslie said . " You go out by yourselves . " " It wo n't cramp my style , " Grant said . " I 'd love to have you . " But the dark little girl continued to shake her head . " I 'll make myself something and read a book . I got lots to read . " Only when Lucky who , apparently , had waited till she was sure Grant meant it and was n't just being polite , asked her did Leslie change her mind and decide to go . And so that was the way it started . Many of the nights when Leslie had no date with her own boyfriend , who was a smalltime theater critic on a Trenton daily but lived in Manhattan , she would dine out with them but almost always she came home alone earlier because she had to be at the office by nine . Amiably and happily for her friend she moved herself out of one of the twin beds in the tiny bedroom and out onto the studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her on nights when her boyfriend came . She was n't doing it for space she said since Ron and Lucky invariably slept all night together in one of the single beds , but for decency . She asked only that they let her get to sleep before they started their action so she would not have to listen and lie awake and be lonely . Usually she was home and asleep before they got there . The only drawback was she had to come in in the morning to get her clothes and if Lucky did n't want her goddam Greek god to be viewed in all his glory " and I mean all " she said , then she better damn well wake up enough to cover him up . If this arrangement was satisfactory , she would request only that once in a while when her own boyfriend came they would let her have the bedroom and sleep at the New Weston . She was not very happy with this boyfriend he can't. , uonnd so seldom , and was going to have to quit him and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness in these married men who remained devoted to their wives while screwing you . As a natter of fart , they slept at the New Weston quite a lot , because thry liked ordering breakfast and having it in bed together . As it turned gut , they did not go to either Twenty-One or Voisin that first evening , they went to the Colony  --  where both girls knew as many or more people in the celebrity-pocked crowd of diners than ( : rant ( lid . They had been roommates all four years in college at Cornell it turned up in the  | talk , to which Leslie had come from her hometown of Toledo and Lucky from Syracuse , and had lived together in New York the last four of the seven years Lucky had been there . Leslie worked for a very big Hollywood  --  New York publicity agency as an executive , and in fact personally handled most of their star accounts . Lucky was n't working at the moment . She had some money of her own , she told Grant , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it was n't always to restaurants of the caliber  --  and expense  --  of the Colony that they went , as the days passed ( at least for Grant ) in a labiapink haze of happiness . The girls knew a lot of excellent fairly cheap little French , Russian , Italian or whatever restaurants  --  such as Le Berry in the West 5os where a lot of show kids hung out and the French sailors off the liners came for the food  --  and after the first couple of days they started saving him money rigorously , especially Leslie . But what they saved for him on restaurants they more than made up for by what they made him spend on clothes , or at least Lucky did . Men 's clothes , not ladies ' clothes . She had mentioned it that first afternoon with Leslie in the apartment , but it was really at Hervey Miller the critic 's house that it started , as in a way their affair itself had  --  and as , in another way , something else started there too , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had first run into Buddy Landsbaum at Hervey 's , Hervey had invited him to a cocktail party ten days hence . Back then Grant had mumbled " Sure , sure , " but secretly  --  in the miserable " Miseries " state he was in  --  he had had no intention of going . Ten days later , with the smell of Lucky in his nose and moustache , permeating him all over in fact like some delicious female cloud , he would n't have missed Hervey 's cocktail party and the chance to show Lucky off to his theater friends for anything . As they climbed the steps of the narrow brownstone with Lucky hanging tight on his arm and leaning a breast on him out here where nobody could see it , it seemed simply absolutely unbelievable that only ten days ago he had not known her , had been lonely and miserable , had been looking for some girl , any girl . Hervey was glad to see them of course although he did n't know Lucky , but when he saw Grant 's face he beamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddy , he told them shaking hands , had departed for the West Coast two days before . Lucky had been nervous about coming . " I do n't know any of these legit theater people , " she said when Grant told her they were going . " They 're not my crowd . Except Buddy . And I did n't even know him when he was theater , only in his films . I 'm going to be on close display , are n't I ? " ? " I  | know , " Grant grinned lovingly . But if she was nervous or shy , it certainly did n't show in the way she acted , or in what she said . It was , once again , so typical of her Grant thought . They were sitting at one end of the long narrow livingroom . Grant was sitting in a deep easy chair with Lucky perched on the arm just to be near him , and was holding forth to Hervey and a couple of others , a novelist and a movie critic , about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty smug and selfsatisfied , with his play done and this exquisite girl hanging onto him and onto his every word , and he was being really witty . Then in the lull that followed a laugh over one of his funnies , Lucky turned to Hervey and said in a matter-of-fact voice : " I 'm in love with him . " She did n't try to say it either quietly or loudly . It rang through the room and through that literary gathering . It had in it the quality that when she loved , it mattered , it was rare , and it counted . " Well , " Hervey said delightedly in his gravelly drawl , " well . Are you . That is n't too really difficult to see , my dear . " He probably had n't had that much openness in his house in months , and he grinned at Grant . " In my own way , I 'm in love with him too , I guess . " Grant was embarrassed but it was a very happy embarrassment . He simply sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room was grinning happily too . " Well , " Hervey said . " You feel pretty good , hunh , keed ? " Grant took Lucky 's hand , aware the other end of the room was watching now , too . " I sure as hell do . " " Look at him , " Lucky said in her best cultivated university voice . " Would you believe that under that ugly lumpy Middlewestern suit exists the body of a Greek god ? " Hervey was even more delighted . Letting his eye run swiftly over the room to check for audience , he said , " I know . I went swimming with Ron once at the YMHA pool to get rid of our hangovers . " He winked at Lucky . " AntI perhaps the brain of a genius ? " " 1 wotllclu't be at all surprised , " Lucky smiled . Hervey had been totally eharttI ( d. " 1'ltere shall I take him , Hervey ? " ? Fake tint ? For what ? " ( lutiIC , . ? I let eN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I go there myself . Sometimes . For things . " " I'etleet , " she said . " ' hy did n't I think of Paul Stuart myself ? " And 1INeye win recluUnletl.  | " Hey ! Hey ! Wait a minute ! I 'm not all that bad ! " Grant put in . " You Ivy-Leaguers ! " " Well , Ron , " Hervey pontificated , " one 's girl can sometimes bring up things one 's friends do n't feel free to . . . " I 'm conspired against ! " Grant grinned . " You have nothing to say about it , " Lucky said . " We 'll go tomorrow . " She put her fingers lovingly on the back of his neck just above his collar . " Look at that tie . " Hervey was captivated . Just about the whole of his cocktail party was listening now , and he decided this might be the high spot of his evening . Grant saw it coming and played the straight man for him . " What 's wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was . " Well , " he drawled , " I ca n't do anything about the suit , Lucia . Ron 's not my size . But I can certainly do something about the tie ! " Come with me , " he said , and led Grant through the laughing party and up the stairs . " That 's certainly some girl you 've got yourself there , " he said as he rummaged through his tie rack . " Is n't she ? " " Where did you find her ? I 've never even seen her before . " " Never you mind ! " IIe smiled . " Actually , Buddy introduced me to her . The other day . She 's an old uh pal of his . " He did n't actually stumble over the word pal , but he felt he had n't inflected it properly . He added , " A friend . " " Here we are . A nice brown-maroon and dark-blue stripe . That really is a terrible tie , yours . She 's absolutely right . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I know , " Grant said knotting it . " I 'm going to keep this tie . A remembrance , " he said grinning into the mirror . Behind him Hervey was studying him kindly , shrewdly , thoughtfully , thumb and forefinger to his chin . " And I think you should , " he said . " I 've known you a long time , have n't I , lion ? Not as long as your Mrs. Abernathy out there in Indianapolis , but almost as long . " Then abruptly he turned away . " All the world loves a lover . " When they marched , chests out , back down and through the party , there was applause and more laughter , and it was then that Lucky , smiling and laughing with pride so much herself that she appeared to be actually blushing , said to Hervey the thing that echoed hollowly through Grant 's  | inner corridors and was to cast a faint but noticeably somber pall over the next happy weeks with her . " I think I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced to Hervey and the others around them . " I can assure you that you could do much , much worse , dear Lucia , " Hervey grinned at her . He clearly had been completely won by her . Grant said nothing , her statement made him almost blush with pride himself , but faint warning bells rang in his ears dimly through the labiapink haze in which he moved . It was one thing for Hervey to hint vaguely upstairs about Carol Abernathy , and quite another for Lucky who knew nothing at all about any of it , to say what she had just said . His old instinct to protect , so ingrained by now that it amounted to a signal reaction almost , had trapped him into that foster-mother ' routine so that now his relationship with Lucky was n't on his part an honest one , and it was n't fair to her . And as the days together passed and as he fell more and more under her spell and more and more in love with her , this initial dishonesty lent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost unbearable . It also , curiously , gave him a vital tough hard-to-catch male quality that enhanced their affair for Lucky as well as for himself . Maybe if he 'd been easier to catch , she would n't have wanted him so much ? The problem was , of course , that he was going to have to leave her . Sometime or other . This made the statues and bare trees and open-air opera in the Park where they walked on good days , the Zoo and the seals and the Cafeteria , all much more lovers ' - poignant , bittersweet and moving than if they knew they were going to stay together and had set up housekeeping somewhere . The same held true for the joints they frequented . Like P.J. Clarke 's , where they 'd gone that first afternoon , and now held a vested interest in . Grant knew that certain people ( many good friends of his had this trait ) actually required this sweet-sad , happy-tragic quality in a love affair for it to be interesting and fulfilling . And he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes . But at other tines it vas much too painful to be pleasant . And Grant had no wife to go hack to , unless you wanted to count Carol Abernathy and Grant did n't . ' I'Ilat evening after I Iervey 's party which had established an even newer closeness I h ' t v vet ) then ) , they had dinner at Billy Reed 's Little Club on I ' : as- 55t ) l , a lorltler li:nigrnit of Lucky 's with some other boyfriend where she knew everyone and proudly showed Grant off , then he took her to a lute path of literary and theater folk on Central Park West in the Seventier , ' Ili ' cal ride t I n ugh the cold Park framed with glittering buildings until sips , the ( ior them ) lovers ' - guide of the Mutual of New York ther-  | mometer , deepened the new closeness between them even more , and Grant caught the cab driver grinning at them in the mirror . All the world did indeed love a lover , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never known . In the apartment of the party high up on the West Side the downtown buildings were even more beautiful , and they stood at the window looking at it and sneaking a little handholding . Out there in the dark Park , Puerto Rican and Harlem kids might be right now beating some adult to death with bicycle chains , and Grant could n't have cared less . Everyone to his own kind of fun . At home , half drunk and with a curiously communicated sorrow ( curiously because neither of them mentioned it or gave any sign of it ) they made love in one style or another with a strange hunger all night and into the dawn and the morning until Leslie got up at 7:30 and knocked to get in and get her clothes and then they had coffee with her . Once she had got started with it , Lucky did not give up on the marriage thing she had started at Hervey Miller the critic 's house . Yet she was never pushy with it , and Grant never felt cramped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " You know , you have to marry me , Ron , " she said one time . " I 'm twenty-seven already , and you 're about my last chance . And anyway , you 're the last of the unmarried writers except for the fags , and I could n't marry anybody but a writer . Also , I 'm in love with you . " There was about her in this the same peculiar openness , frankness that he had noted in her in other things . There was also about her in this an odd and terrible sadness , as if she could n't believe that it was not all too good to be true . And that sadness hurt Grant almost more than he could afford . She was n't angry or demanding . She seemed totally helpless , totally at his mercy , and furthermore unashamed , uncaring about showing it . He had told her about his plans to go to Kingston to learn diving ( She had grinned , and said , " You do n't need to learn diving , darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingston very well , had lots of friends there , had stayed there often . Her South American boyfriend had uscd to stash her there for weeks at a time while he returned to his South American country to help make a revolution . " Oh , take me with you ! I wo n't be any trouble ! " she cried excitedly . " I 'll introduce you to everybody ! I know wonderful places ! I know Kingston like ? " They were to have been married in two months when he went back the last time and got shot . " I ca n't take you with mc , " Grant said , almost automatically . Then he went on to explain how lie had conceived this as a project to be done totally alone , how it had to be done alone , and studied , because he thought it might bring back a reality to his writing which he was afraid it was beginning to lose , that it  | would give him new material  --  new thinking material  --  for his work . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a means of getting totally away from Carol Abernathy for a while , or how Carol Abernathy had frustrated this by inviting herself along . " Oh , you really must take me along ! " Lucky said sadly and with the eagerness of a little girl . " I know it so well ! I 'd love to go back ! I know the greatest hotel , the owner 's a wonderful man , if it 's me with you he 'll give us a discount ! I know so many places and things there ! " " I ca n't , " Grant said . " I simply ca n't . I 'd like to . " Again she did not press . But she brought it up from time to time hopefully . And when she conceived her idea to marry him at Hervey 's party , she tacked that onto it : they could be married in Kingston , at the hotel , her friend Rene Halder the hotel owner would officiate , he would love it . Grant could only smile and shake his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stuart . It was not the day after Hervey 's party , but almost a week after . After a lazy morning in bed , after making love lazily twice with the bright winter sun streaming in coldly through the light curtains in the warm little room , while she squatted in the bathtub washing herself out for the second time and Grant stood leaning in the doorway watching her fondly , Lucky announced that today was going to be Paul Stuart day . So he might as well prepare himself , she grinned , and shook her ass like a wet dog and straightened up for a towel . Ron Grant playwright was going to buy clothes . They would have lunch at some nice midtown restaurant and he could prepare himself with two or three but no more martinis and so would she , and then they would go to Paul Stuart 's . No fucking around . Docilely Grant , grinning sheepishly , allowed himself to be led , and for it received what he could only call , after thirty-six years of being alive , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wanted nothing for herself . Indeed , there was almost nothing for ladies in the shop except a few scarves . The light c , f the love on her face for him was so visibly apparent that the clerks in the store fell in with the game at once , delightedly , and looked at Grant with N. I ' : ven the customers who came in were delighted , and hung around to watch . When they took Grant into the little fitting room , Lucky went ton . To fit ( : rant with a readymade suit whose coat was big enough for his shoulders required that all the pants be altered and cut down . I in kv instructed them in this . And when the clerk was out of the little : taint , she was all over ( : rant laughing , kissing him and feeling him up in Ins shorts so that Iu ? had to he extremely cautious so the clerk would not xee the more than hall hard-on the was sporting . Laughing still more , she  | refused to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the lipstick on his face the second time he came back . " Compliments of the house , Madam , " he said to Lucky . It was a scene from a Clark Gable  --  Carole Lombard movie of a happier time if there ever was one in life , and everybody was participating . In the end they went out with two suits , a charcoal and a subdued brown stripe , a newly styled but still classic tuxedo , sundry kneelength black socks to replace Grant 's Argyles , narrow Ivy League ties , buttondown shirts , handkerchiefs . Everything but underwear , in fact . Lucky extracted a promise that the altered suit pants would be delivered next day , and they took a taxi to the New Weston , an elevator to the suite , and fell laughing and loving on the bed  --  that big soft ugly bed that did n't seem so ugly to Grant any more . The truth was he could n't really believe that she was for real . If she was , why not take her to Kingston ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Indianapolis , straighten up affairs , come back here and pick her up . Better yet , why go to Indianapolis ? He did n't have to . Take her from here and get on a plane and go straight to Kingston without even stopping in Ganado Bay . The truth was he was scared . First he was scared of the scene  --  or scenes  --  he would have to have with Carol Abernathy . Second he was just scared in general . It would mean changing , reorienting his whole life and his plans for his life . Yet he had always intended some ( lay to marry . It was just that it was always off there in the future somewhere , vague and formless , not sitting here in his lap with its teeth in his throat . And yet  --  what the hell ? What could Carol Abernathy do to him really ? Point to the church ? It was a peculiar situation . Just because he was not married . Luck . Because in one way he was as free as a bird . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce anybody , or pay alimony , or dispose of any mutually held property . On the other hand there were fourteen years of a way of life , a manner of living ( increasingly insupportable , it was true ) behind him that it was difficult to uproot and wrench out of him . He was worried about mney , for another thing . IIe had been spending much more this trip to New York than he had meant or intended to , more than he could really ; Ilford . And the way he was living with no investments or capital laid by , if e:u h new play was n't a solid hit  --  he was broke . A lid what if this girl he was falling in love with was too good to be true ? What if , like all the other girls he had fallen in love or nearly fallen in love with , Lucky turned out to have a set of complexes or a gross egomania she c ( nildn  --  t control ? Or a megalomania like Carol Abernathy ?  | That evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . They had drinks sent up , had dinner sent up , had coffee sent up , watched the Late Show and the Late Late Show , and made love over and over in that same peculiar hungry way they had the night of Hervey Miller 's cocktail party . Grant 's more or less definite date of departure was only three days off now , and they talked about this . ? " You talk about your search for reality in diving , " Lucky said once . " Reality is me . Marrying me , taking our chances with living . Having kids maybe . Who might be morons . Mongoloids . Or geniuses . That 's reality . " Grant did n't answer. ? " Maybe , " he said after a while . " I know I love you . " She was sitting nude on the bed with those supple legs clasped up against her chest , her cheek resting on her knee , looking at him . " But I do n't believe in love , " Grant said . ? " Neither do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucky said . " It 's funny , is n't it ? " She did not move . " I only know I have to be by myself , alone for a while , " he lied , or halflied . " I have to think a lot of things out . " She still did not move , and her great blue eyes looked and looked at him solemnly . " Oh , I love you so , " she said in a small voice like a little girl 's . " I do n't know what 'll happen to me when you leave me . " Two tears ran silently down her face . She continued to look at him . Then suddenly she threw back her head , sniffled , wiped her eyes and laughed a choked-up , lovely laugh . " I 'll be back in six weeks , " Grant said painfully . Lucky had unclasped her knees and was sitting crosslegged . ? " Ahh . But it wo n't be the same , " she said . " Do n't you see ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to him until her legs fell over the bed edge . Then he knelt and kissed his way up both of them and buried his face in that delicious place where he sometimes would like , in such painful moods as this , or so he often told himself , to return completely . Above him , he heard her sigh . Ile made no decisions . He postponed his departure date yet another week , rented a car and took her up to Frank Aldane 's in Connecticut for a weekend .  | IT WOULD BE A NICE WEEKEND , he told her . Secretly , he wanted to know what Frank and Marie thought of her . At the same time he knew beforehand , even to the phraseology his friends would use , exactly what they would say , and that it would be extremely cautionary . But he needed other opinions , any opinions . At the same time he was more crazily in love with her than ever , could hardly stand the thought of going away from her , and wanted nothing more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going now . " I hate country weekends , " Lucky said . " I hate the country . " But she knew she was being put up for inspection , and prepared herself accordingly without complaints . Grant had already arranged one inspection for her . The day before Paul Stuart 's had decided him to stay on another week he had arranged for her to meet his producers , agent and director for cocktails . From which meeting she had emerged with more than flying colors , with flying everything . They met at Rattazzi 's on 48th Street , a hangout of his producers because it was right across the street from their midtown offices , which were a little far uptown for Broadway producers but which for that very reason gave them a certain air they felt . Lucky had never been to Rattazzi 's , though she often went to Michael 's Pub a few doors away . Because he had a final conference with them that afternoon , he told her to meet them there at 5:30 , Paul Gibson and Arthur Kline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays and had been with him as a gang , a rather bawdy gang , from the start . Big Arthur Kline , massive , sorrowful , all the world 's enduring and overpowering ills and sorrows stamped on his great kindly moonface like road directions on a map , was a perfect matching partner for the smaller , liardeyed nervous bundle of bones and flesh which went by the  | name of Paul Gibson . It was hard to believe looking at the two of them that big Arthur was the tough hard mean-dealing businessman , and Gibson the sensitive , tasteful artist of the combination who could weep over some of Grant 's scenes . They had plenty of other successes in the string , mostly in musicals , but perhaps for that very reason , plus the fact that Grant was their most successful legitimate theater writer , he was a special favorite . The director , a slightly older man named Don Celt , was the newest member of the group , having directed only one of Grant 's plays before , the second , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all read the first act sent in from Indianapolis . It was Gibson and Kline who had first suggested that Grant hire Wood , after the huge success of The Song of Israphael , the first play about the sailor and the whore . Wood was an old friend of theirs , and a perpetual enemy , and though they had chosen him now fought against them for Grant with a dedicated fury . All in all they were a congenial , hairy , bawdy talking bunch , and Grant had been working hard with them on the script of the play all these weeks , in addition to his late nights and long mornings with Lucky . Usually they met for lunch to discuss and worked after , or met after lunch and worked through the afternoon till closing . Mostly the work consisted of trying to get Grant to change words or scenes for reasons of censorship or business ' ( for business read in good taste ' ) , and also sometimes  --  this was rare ? because of esthetic or purely technical disagreements . If they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the apartment , and then meet her for drinks somewhere as soon as he left them . It was the only time he was away from her . But now all that work was over , at least until such time as they began rehearsals , and he was only staying on now because of her . IIe had told them all about her of course . In his happiness and relief he could n't have resisted . And in fact Gibson and Kline had noticed the change before he told them , because all their secretaries began arriving on time and the office ran smoothly . Old friends now over the years they knew what to expect from Grant , and one unavoidable penalty of a Grant stay in New York was turmoil , inefficiency and late arrivals for work among the secretarial force . At least until Grant settled onto one girl . Arthur Kline always accused Grant of suffering from satyriasis . So it was pretty much an established pattern when Grant told them about . ncky . They expected it . Arthur , his big moonfacc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , rolled his eyes over at his partner  | and made a slowmotion shrug . Both men had met Mrs. Carol Abernathy ( taking the train out to Indianapolis expressly for that purpose ) , both had felt the lash of her tongue ( and in the earlier days the power of her personality ) , both had kept their mouths totally shut about what they thought of Grant 's relationship to her . They had also been introduced to ( pate a number of Grant 's New York girls . They were totally unprepared for the entrancing vision of loveliness that came floating up to them in Rattazzi 's , downed two hefty martinis , kidded them , spoke seriously and sympathetically to them about their boy Grant , and floated away again with a hammerstruck Grant tightly in arm . Of the four of them only Don Celt the director had ever even heard of her before . " Oh , sure , " he said , in the office 's bar-garneroom , when told they were meeting her for drinks . " I knew her out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did n't really know her , met her a couple of times . Crazy chick . She 's the one tried to run down Buddy Landsbaum with his own car one night . Damn near did . Would of killed him . " Some look in Grant 's eye seemed to warn him , and he seemed to sort of turn and run the ball along the sideline while at the same time trying not to step one of his feet out of bounds . " Uh , one of those crazy nights . Everybody drunk as hell . I do n't know what the trouble ? Yeah , I 'd like to meet her , " he said . " Again . " None of them knew what it was that she did to them . Least of all did Grant . It was as though she used some sort of ESP device , some sort of personal telepathy , which shut off and dazzled their eyes to everything but herself . For instance nobody knew what happened to her coat , or whether she even had one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took over , dominated them , left them staring vaguely at each other , and took Grant away with her . " That 's some girl you got there , Ron , " big Arthur said with his sorrowful smile when Grant finally saw them again . " She 's a real beauty . Makes me wish I was thirty years younger . " If you were thirty years younger , you 'd be twelve , " Grant said . " Well , then twenty , " Arthur said . " Site 's got class . Some kind of class , " Paul Gibson said with a puzzled look , " that you do n't see on a lot of girls in this town . " " St vie , " said the fastidious Durrell Wood , " is what you mean . Style . " I ion Celt , still trying to move the ball forward along the sidelines withtat ( stepping out of bounds , frowned weightily . " She does n't look at all like I remember her . She looks mellower now . That 's it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's because she 's met me. "  | Anyway , they all thought Grant had done himself proud this time , and at the same time some curious delicate instinct made them refrain from kidding him about a new girl as they might he expected to do , as indeed they had done lots of other times in the past . It was about the most perfect reaction Grant could have asked for . Lucia ( he had taken to calling her Lucia a lot now , like Hervey Miller , as though Lucky was too crass and too New Yorkese a nickname now for the way he felt about her ) Lucia had told him about the dress , her dress , right away after , as they walked away from Rattazzi 's through the mucky sidewalks and slushy streets down 48th toward Park . " You were wonderful ! " he said . She laughed , with a sort of wild flashing glare . " Well , not really , " she said modestly . " But I did have a serious decision to make . Knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wait a minute ! They 're not fink bastards ! " " ( Of course not , ) " she said parenthetically , " ( do n't you think I know that ? ) ? Knowing the way all those fink bastards who step out in town while their wives stay out in Westchester County think about New York single girls , I decided I 'd better dress for them . The trouble was , I only have two prim dresses . And one of them is sleeveless : Bare Armpits ! But the other one is a little old and 's a little faded under the arms . Well , I decided to wear the one with sleeves and keep my arms down . And after I saw that gang , I knew I was right . " Grant had listened , at first delighted by the story , and then horrified at the direction in which it was leading her . " Oh , no ! There was n't anything like that in it , " he growled . " They 're not like that ! They know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been bragging you up to them for weeks . " " Even so it 's a hell of a thing to make a girl do and put her through . " " But that was n't it , that was n't it ! I swear it was n't ! " " Anyway , I did it for you . " " No ! Please ! Anyway , you were so magnificent I do n't think any of them even saw v ( nrr dress . " " What does that matter ? It helped me get my con started . All of them sitting there irr a row , waiting to inspect me . I bet I 've fucked fifty men like then . Before I learned better . And every one of them 's scared to death ... ( : rant found there was very little to say to this . At least you 're not scared , Ron . " " No , " he said , lo1meg it was true . " I 'm not scared . " ' " ! ' heir wives , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! "  | " No , no ! It was n't anything like that . It was n't an inspection . They 're my friends ! I work with them ! I wanted you to meet them . " They had reached Park , and the wind came down it , biting in their faces . And now it was Lucky 's turn not to say anything . Grant had never seen her in such a state . When she did speak her voice had an almost lowing quality , deep , reverberant , about it . " Oh , Ron . I love you so . You and your secret little inspections . Take me home . Take me home quick . Take me home quick and make love to me . Make love to me my way . " Grant thought later that he must have seemed almost to leap up off the ground . He moved that fast . But as usual whenever anyone really wanted one , there were no taxis immediately available . He came back to her and she took his arm . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no anger in her all along , it was something else . She hugged onto him and let him shelter her with his body from the wind . Finally , on the other side of Park , they found an empty cab coming down the ramp under the clock tower . In the cab they started necking hungrily , Grant not caring how much lipstick he got on him , with all the sweet hotness that belongs to youth and that before meeting her Grant had not felt for a long time , and Lucky grabbed his excited crotch through his trousers with one hand . But when they broke apart , she made him take her handkerchief for his face . " Wo n't Leslie be home ? " he asked , wiping . " No , she 's got a cocktail date with a new boyfriend . What she hopes will he a new boyfriend ! " Grant did n't answer , and the cab moved along past the snowcovered street islands . It had come into his mind while kissing her to tell her about Don Celt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his story about her trying to run Buddy Landsbaum down with his own car . Don had looked so peculiar . Could Celt have been one of her nameless 400 men too , like Buddy ? Grant ground his teeth with a strange peculiar hatefilled anguish he had never felt before . He decided it was better not to say anything , not just now . And why had it come into his mind just when he was kissing her ? " You 're such a stupid bastard really , " she suddenly said lovingly . " You 're so lucky to have ? " She stopped . " To have what ? " " To have me in love with you ! " she said defiantly . " That 's what ! " " I know it , " Grant said humbly . Could she have divined his thought al milt Celt and Buddy ? It was weird . And he clicl know he was lucky . Nevertheless this did not save him from taking a fearful tongue-lashing from Leslie when she finally got home  | from her cocktail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and having a drink together and warm and safe again , when she stamped in on her tiny feet in her tiny quickstepping walk , and launched into him without preamble . " Of all the goddam lousy chickenshit things to dol Of all the ? That is the most goddam fucking insulting thing I have ever heard of . How dare you ? Do you know who you are messing around with here ? You are not playing around with some parttime call girl chorus girl from the Copal You are having a love affair with Lucia Videndi , Ron Grant ! Making her come out and display herself and be inspected by your goddamned producers , to see whether they think you ought to go out with her or not ! I do n't care whether you 're a big important playwright or not ! " There was much more in this vein before Lucky finally got her shushed up and stopped , with Grant trying to protest his innocence all the time . Then she went over and flung herself down in the one big chair and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a postage stamp . " Goddam fucking men : Not one pair of balls down the whole of Madison Avenue . All of you . Men make me sick . Why oh why we even got to need you and have to have you  --  I just wish there was some other way for a girl to be happy . " " What happened with your date ? " Lucky said . " Nothing , " Leslie said and shrugged . " Oh , you know . The same old crap . The same usual warmhearted bullshit routine . I understand him . " She looked up at Lucky . " He 's married too you know of course . I do n't see why if they are all so goddam unhappily married so much all of them all the time , why did they ever get married in the first place . " She wiped her eyes and nose  --  and became totally despondent . " I do n't know , " she said sullenly . " It is n't worth it . " " Ron 's leaving Thursday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from now . " " Oh , you poor darling ! " Leslie cried , her eyes losing their dullness . Lucky threw her head back , tossing her champagne hair , and laughed gaily though it clearly cost her quite an effort . She looked like she might cry but she did n't . " Four days is four days . Can be a long time . " ( : rant was hurting more at the moment than he was willing to invest . " Listen , you two deadheads , " he growled at them , more viciously energetic than he meant , and both turned to stare . Ile softened his tone . " What 's going on hare , anyway ? What kind of a morgue is this ? Is this any way to Ul ) end Isis ' last lour clays in town ? Come on , let 's all go out and do something . "  | " You 're absolutely right , " Lucky said . Leslie 's eyes fired up again with indignant outrage when she looked at Grant . " You really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kingston ! " " I ca n't , " he said . " I 've explained it all before . I just simply ca n't . " He remained adamant about that . However , the afternoon at Paul Stuart had made him decide to stay over another week , and coupled to the meeting with his producers , and then the weekend at the Aldanes ' , all three were enough to make him change his plans about New York . He had intended , after his diving junket to Jamaica , to go straight back home to Indianapolis and start in work on another play ( though he had no idea yet what subject it would be about ) , and try to get as deep into it as he could before he was needed for rehearsals on this one , on I 'll Never Leave Her . ( My God , he thought with despair , did you ever really call it that ? Yes ; you did ! ) Now though , he was coming straight back from Jamaica to Manhattan , to Lucky . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somewhere and try to get started on the new play here . IIe told all this to Lucky , rather proudly , on Monday on their way back to the city from the Aldanes ' . It was once again four days to departure time . " All right , " Lucky said calmly , without any great enthusiasm , " we 'll see . It 's all right . We 'll just have to wait and see . How do I know what will happen in the next six weeks to change you ? How do you know what will happen to change me ? " IIe was at the wheel . " You do n't mean like  --  you would fall in love with somebody else ? Do you ? " Having to watch the road carefully , he did not look at her . " I do n't know , " she said , with a sort of tired patience . " How do I know ? " " Well , if it is , it is , " Grant said , vaguely but also stiffly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass a slower car . " That 's what I said , " Lucky said calmly . " Nobody 's going to bulldoze me into anything , " he said . " Nobody 's trying to , " Lucky said airily , and went on looking out the window . She had , at the Aldanes ' , once again been her own unbelievably winning , too-good-to-be-true self . I t had been a lovely ride up there in the Hertz car , along the curving parkways , the fields all snowy but the roads clear and good , not much traffic . Frank had a nice old colonial house under big trees on the side of a hill , a guesthouse , five acres of parklike woods they could walk through in the snow . They did not , however , do much walking . But they did do a lot  | of drinking . Lucky did n't like the country outdoors , and Grant discovered he was not equipped with the proper shoes and clothes for snow-walking . On the other hand , they both were properly dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank Aldane was a big drinker . Frank Aldane was a big drinker , but he took very good care of his health while doing it  --  as he did with everything . This was largely because he was a consummate hypochondriac . Six months ago he had stopped smoking because of the cancer scare . For two months he had been unable to write at all , but after that he had come out of it into the clear , cleanlunged and cured , and now buttonholed everybody that he could get to listen about how they must stop smoking . His intensity when making these speeches made his genuine concern for everybody that much more sweet , endearing . He would n't even smoke a pipe , now , he said . Among all of his contemporaries Frank Aldane was the one Grant valued most , both as a talent and as a thinker , the one he felt most drawn to . Although Frank was a novelist and Grant a playwright , they seemed to see more nearly eye to eye concerning the drift of the post-war world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They seemed to be trying to get said and noticed , each in his field , pretty much the same thing about this world ? although in private they admitted to each other that it did n't matter much even if they did , would not make much difference . Both men were deeply despairing-type personalities anyway but neither had sufficient egomania to try , like some in their generation , in every generation , to corner the market on despair all for himself alone . So they could talk about all this . Both believed that , given the expectable increase in government 's control of the social body 's functions and its mental attitudes , in order for it to perform efficiently in an ever increasingly complex industrial society , men of their type would be squeezed out of existence in a very short time , maybe fifty years , and they loved to discuss all this and elaborate on it gloomily when in their cups , which is what they did most of that weekend . Neither was in favor of this sort of human development . lint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them was ; dnccc , t perpctoally pointing out to the other , it was manifestly impossible to c c , t n n to a more primitively industrial society and the taking over of nii ii minds was advancing at a vastly accelerated rate ( compared to Home , . , try , or the Middle Ages ) because of both modern techniques in pet suasion and : ulvaiieed mass methods of what fools called communicatic:c ' . " Yes . Not only all that , we 're in the Age of the Believer , Decameron , " Flunk hiccupped train in front of the great fireplace late on the night of  | their arrival ( he adored calling Grant by his full first name , because Grant hated it ) . " The real Age of the Believer . Believers have always been dangerous . The most dangerous . But the various Inquisitions of the past have never had our means of communication , or the mechanical ability to employ our full saturation methods . Or the sheer bureaucratic political power of a modern great nation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant gloomed over his glass . " I know all that . In fact it was me who first pointed it out to you so succinctly . And there 's no way out . " " Or ! " Frank continued , finger in air , " the incredibly efficient means of industrialized destruction which the Believer can employ to destroy a segment of a society . I need not point out to you what happened with Hitler and the Jews . " " What happened with Hitler and the Jews has been grossly misunderstood by modern thinkers , " Grant said . " Exactly ! " " And not only that ! it was not even a military function . It was a civil function ! And there 's no way out , " Grant said again , hugging his glass gloomily . Lucky was with Frank 's wife Marie in the kitchen preparing them all a 3 A.M. snack to kill hangovers . " Do n't be too sure ! " Frank said , and laid a sly drunken finger alongside his rather shapeless nose there in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is , finally , something that can be done . " " Then tell me " " Not yet , not yet . I think I have to prepare you a little first . You 're peculiar . But I 'll tell you before you leave this place . That 's a promise . " " Aw , fuck , come on . If you knew how depressed I get thinking about all this . I get so depressed I ? That 's the main reason I 'm going away . Off on this diving business . Just to ? " " I do n't see that that 'll do you no good , " Frank said with the air of a sage . " It do n't make sense . " " l did n't say it did . I said ? " " Come and get it , or we 'll eat it all ourselves , " Lucky called to them softly so as not to wake the four Aldane children . - On the other hand , " Grant said , getting up to follow her , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last frontier left to in individual to do individual work by himself and all on his own as an individual . " " lint what the hell good does that do the world you and I 're talkin about ? " Frank said following him . " And anyway ! " he roared gleefully  | from behind Grant , " I think that you 'll find that to really contribute anything to anything even skindiving will have to become  --  bureaucratized , organized ! " " Maybe not , " Grant said over his shoulder mysteriously  --  with much more mystery than he actually felt . What he actually felt was depressed , rock bottom depressed . " Aw fuck , come on ! Look at fucking Cousteau , " Aldane hollered triumphantly , following through the door . " He 's made the biggest contribution made so far  --  with his Organization ! " " The hell with Cousteau , " Grant said glumly . " Not so loud , Professor , " Marie Aldane said to her husband from the kitchen table , and winked at Lucky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So did I , " Grant said . He stopped before the table . " Look at my girl , " he said spreading his arms , more to cheer himself up than anything else . " Ai nt she something . " " She sure is , " Aldane said with a lecher 's appreciation . " I think so too , " Marie grinned , " and I 'm a girl . " Lucky looked up at them and smiled , especially at Grant , and calmly went on eating . She was three-fourths drunk like the rest of them . But it was all true . She had already seduced them both . By whatever alchemy or internal magic it was that she employed Lucky had once again , as she had done with the producers , completely altered her entire personality . It was as if she had reached down inside herself with both hands and molding her spirit as if it were pie dough , changed herself into someone else , a someone she knew with a shrewd psychology both the Aldanes would adore . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to which Grant carried the suitcase for her , she first put away all of Grant 's things neatly , then put away her own , changed to a sweater and an old pair of slacks and came downstairs in old ballet slippers with her champagne hair tied back in a stringy ribbon , looking as if she loved and had lived in the country all her life . It was an entrance calculated to sew the literary Aldanes up in a sack and deliver them at her feet from the very beginning , which was just what it slid . But it was n't only physical . She had made herself a country girl , like Marie . Leaving the men at the fire ( a thing Grant had never seen her do anywhere before at any party or anywhere else : leave the men ) , she went out to the kitchen and began to help Marie and the colored maid who  | were feeding the children their supper , all the time complaining laughingly how she was not a country girl , she was a city girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she could not cook , and did n't want to learn , she detested washing dishes well , she would never do housework , she was a rare and delicate flower , and would be treated as such , if you hump them well that 's enough , until she had both women laughing out loud . At the same time she did as much work as either of them , tied on an apron , petted the children , but everything she told them was the truth and what was more they knew it was the truth . That night was Friday . The next night being Saturday , they had a large bunch of people in and a big buffet for them , critics , newspaper writers , painters , an art critic , a sculptor , Grant 's one-night-stand lady novelist whose recent book had lately suddenly shown signs of becoming a towering bestseller , all people who lived in the area . Now dressed to the teeth with full makeup and a simple sheath dress , and those magnificent tits and that high , back-switching ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house breathing hotly through his nose and with one hand in his pocket to finger himself tentatively through the cloth . The art critic especially , an aging and humorous egotist with a ragged white moustache and lecherous goatee , could not stay away from her and followed her wherever she went about the two large rooms filled with people . Even so , she made a friend out of his wife by more of her talk about the horrors of living in the country , and by calling him laughingly to his face a dirty old goat so charmingly that he was flattered and delighted . Grant had only to stand and beam , and the next day , Sunday , Marie received five phone calls about Ron Grant 's marvelous new girl . Saturday night after most of the people had departed , when Grant went out to the kitchen to refill his scotch glass and encountered Marie Aldane sitting all by herself over a large drink just giggling , he was ordered to sit down and was then given a ten-minute lecture on the reasons why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all , without looking back , before some gentleman smarter than himself swept her , so to speak , out from under him . Thus he had the answer of one of the Aldanes . He never did find out why she was giggling . Later on , when the two girls had given up and gone on to bed and the two drunk writers sat together before the fire , Frank was more circumspect . It was true that she had all the personal  --  and personable  --  qualities necessary . My God : an MA in political science ! And a wit that could n't be learned in any school . He would n't even bother wasting time going into her physical beauty and charm . But marriage was , or should be , for a long  | time . She had been on her own  --  really on her own , not by her family ? around New York quite a long time ; seven years was it ? and that might indicate a kind of overly wild quality in her . And any girl around town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shopworn which often made for neuroses later in her . Not so far as Grant was concerned , but as far as she was concerned inside herself . And after all , how long had he known her ? only three weeks ? She was n't really a very literary type girl . And Grant had always been more a literary type playwright , rather than the Broadway type playwright . Anyway , after all , the clincher was that Grant himself was not taking her down to Jamaica with him like she wanted , but was going alone . Incidentally , if Grant wanted to give him her telephone number he could look after her and sort of keep an eye on her while Grant was gone since he was going to be in the city quite a lot the next couple of months . " Haw ! None of that shit , you bastard ! " Grant said . " Do n't forget I 'm comin back in six weeks . You 're on your honor . " Aldane sighed sadly . " Ahh . These damned honors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well . We have a choice . We can go to bed , or we can play the Civil War records . " For a moment he wavered slightly like the needle of some gauge , then came to rest fully perpendicular . " No , not tonight , " Grant said . " The way I feel , if I heard The Yellow Rose of Texas right now , I 'd break down and cry again , like I did the last time . " " Then I suggest a nightcap , Decameron , " Frank said heading for the kitchen . " What about her family ? " Decameron , Decameron ! Grant thought with a sudden blind drunken rage . Boccaccio , Boccaccio ! Once going to summer camp he gave himself the name Michael Jeremy Grant on the Application Form , and was very nearly disallowed for the season by the camp director until he agreed to fill out a new form . Very few people knew his real first name . And although Time magazine had once sent a researcher out to look it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to expose it in their theater section , very few readers remembered it . To the world and Io ncaders of Life he was still Ron Grant . Ile had even legalized it . tlut not to yourself , not to yourself ! As a very little boy it was Cam or : ; ( ! hilly . I le still hated the superciliousness of grownups using a -y or - ie diminutive for youngsters . When he was ten or eleven for a year or two he was called ( ; ; liner. ( by his witty classmates . In high school where he just barely played looti all it was Dekc which of course eventually , inevitably lwu. ) tUr I ) ( wcon and spoiled high school for hint . At college he beat them to it un ( I K ( wn himself the nickname Ron , which seemed to work well with  | the girls  --  at least until he made the mistake of telling each new love his reel first name , whereupon they would break into golden , joyous , sexless college girl peals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew well ) had been one of those secret iconoclastic Middlewestern scholars who believed in and loathed the general frigidity of the local females like Grant 's mother ( whom he never knew well either ) . But to name a defenseless kid Decameron was a low blow whatever the reason . Certainly it Ilad contributed to his terrible and lifelong inferiority complex . Was it also what had made him so terribly oversexed all his life ? Grant knew lots of people who did n't seem to give a damn about sex one way or the other . " I do n't know much about her family , " he said . He discovered that he was now on his feet  --  had gotten up already  --  and followed to the kitchen . " I know her father was a big bootlegger , but he 's dead . She does n't seem to be on good terms with her mom . Uhh . She did say that when we got married , her mother would give us ten thousand dollars as a wedding present . " Aldane 's head jerked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of . " That 's good , " he said . " I must admit that it impressed me considerably , " Grant said shamefacedly . " It never hurts a writer to have a rich wife , " Frank said pouring now from the scotch bottle for Grant . He was of course referring obliquely to himself , since Marie was worth something just under a million dollars . Grant knew the story of how Marie had chased him all over France one whole year right after his first novel came out , trying to marry him , and he kept refusing because her mother 's family had had him investigated by a private detective when they found out she was in love with him . Aldane had had the upper hand ever since . " You do n't have to write potboilers , or for the movies , " Aldane continued . " But then you as a playwright make a lot more dough than I do as a novelist . It 's in the cards . " " If I do , I do n't have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should meet her mother , " Frank said , and paused . " What 's your uh foster-mother going to say about it ? What 's her name ? ? Mrs. Abernathy . " There was , under that question , a serious note of secret interest . " The same as any mother , I mean , any other mother . What the hell ? That ai nt got anything to do with it . " Frank and Marie had always been content to follow his lead on the subject of his foster-mother , whatever gossip they may or may not have heard . " Well , " Frank said holding his glass up to the light and admiring it .  | Suddenly it fell from his hand and smashed on the tile floor . " Shit ! " he said and turned to get another . " Well , as I was about to say , I enjoy , I might even say I empathize , with your affair , you and Lucky . But then , as you well know , that is my gout . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . " Grant bent to brush splashes of bourbon from his pantsleg and almost fell down in the glass shards . He straightened up smiling . " I tell you what . Let 's sleep on the floor again and pretend we 're boy scouts again . I got to do something . I 'm going flicking nuts . You remember that crazy night ? " Frank Aldane grinned . Marie had found them in the morning , snugly tucked under a big polar bear skin of hers on the livingroom floor , fully dressed , peacefully asleep . " Not tonight , " Aldane said judiciously . " The bear rug is being cleaned . Anyway , did you forget you 've got Lucky up-stairs ? " " My God ! " Grant said , aghast . " I forgot ! I actually forgot ! " " Take your glass with you , " Aldane said . Grant did . When he crept in beside her , she immediately snuggled up to him even though she was sound asleep , and he saw that she too was sleeping nude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'm maybe oversexed ? " he whispered anxiously . " Well if you are , so am I , " Lucky murmured sleepily , " so it 's all right . " " You do n't care if my first name is Decameron ? " " I would n't care if your first name was Firestonetire , " she murmured . Grant felt an enormous relief flood over him , because of both points . " I 'm glad these springs do n't squeak , " was all he said as he turned her tenderly on her back . But as he entered her , " Hansel and Gretel again , " was what he was thinking . " You drink too much , " Lucky whispered sleepily and kissed his ear as she elevated her hips and legs to receive him . 0 the beautiful pissy musk of the opening female ! It was probably true he did drink too much . But it did n't seem to hurt him any . Yet . There was no getting around it , he was in love , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday thew all spent most of the day cursing Saturday night . In spite of tluat Fr ; oik Aldanc did get set up and pursue his little indoctrination emit W lug li he had promised Grant , and he pursued it right to its promised end which was the revelation of his new panacea for America in a superorganized world . The indoctrination ' had mostly to do with a young lawyer whu had beco at last night 's party . " You met him . 1 ) o you remember him ? Lester IIorton ? Did you get a thane++ to talk to him ? "  | " Dark and slight ? Looked Jewish . No , not much . What 's so important about him ? " " That young man graduated Harvard Law School with the next to highest grades ever taken . He now lives in Washington , where he is involved with the government . Not only that , he is a very close friend of the President . " " So ? " Frank 's momentous pause was positively pregnant . " How would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say , in Rio as the United States 's Artist in Residence in Brazil ? " Triumph shone on his face . " Well , I do n't know , " Grant said cautiously . " I never thought about it . You mean , it actually could happen ? " Frank nodded vigorously . " It could . That 's Les 's own project , one of the things he 's working on for the President . " " Well , I guess I 'd like it , " Grant said still cautiously . " I 'm not so sure it would be good for me . Or my work . " He looked over at Lucky . " I love Rio , " she smiled . " You been there , too ? " Grant said sourly . She nodded , smiling at him happily . " Under this administration , " Frank said sententiously , " for the first time American history it is happening that the artist and the intellectual actually can be active in Government . " " I guess that 's true , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being committed to anything , any Administration , any nation even . You know how I believe that any artist who is really engage to anything , any politique , any philosophy even , becomes passe and just about worthless as soon as the conditions which created his particular politique or philosophy change . Shit , look at all them Thirties writers ! " " Look , " Frank said . " You 're one of the few men of real integrity I know . ' tour first play was a huge success . All that fame , success , money never touched you . You , like me , know what the almost insurmountable problems are going to be to try and save any sense of the individual skeptic . Inml free thinker in any future society which we are already building now ; " Am ! , I 'm too cynical , " Grant said embarrassedly . " Nobody 'd want to tall , to nie . " He looked over at Lucky . " Anyway , I 'd rather get laid . " " Well , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Aldane said seriously . " ' These men want our ideas , for the first time in history , whether t Ile s nu ? them or not . It certainly ca n't hurt . We must try to help . " : . i n't you see that by its very nature it ca n't work ? The weight , the sheet mass , of any society is always unoriginal , unimaginative , conserva-  | tive . The very things you and I , the artists , want to change about people to make them better are the very things people do n't want changed . It ca n't be any other way . You and I are therefore compelled to address ourselves to unborn future generations " " But now at least we can advise , " Frank said . " Aw , come on . Advise what ? And be listened to ? Naw . " " Well anyway I gave of Les Horton your address , " Frank said . " You 'll be hearing from him . " " I ai nt going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You 're still determined to go through with this kooky diving business ? " Frank said almost pedagogically . " I sure am . " " What if you got killed ? " " It 's not that dangerous . " " People do get killed doing it . " " I know , but not very many . " " You remember all what I 've told you . Honor , you said ! Honorably , we have to try . Think about it . " " Okay , I will , " Grant said , glad to get off the subject . His depression of Friday night was returning , as it always did when he let himself think about the world and its future . He held up his left arm with his wrist watch on it . " Look ! We made it ! It 's after five ! What do you say we have a drink ? " But in the car going back to the city the next day Lucky brought the subject up again herself . " If what Frank says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try . It 's everyone 's responsibility , to his society , to his race . Besides , I 'd love to spend a year in Rio . " " We ai nt married yet , " Grant heard himself say . " And you lay off of me with your Cornell socio-political socialist ideas . I 'm an artist , a playwright . I want to know what makes the wellsprings of human character tick . Let the others save the world . " It was , he noted , as both of them had also privately noted only a little short cliile before , right here in this same Hertz car on this same highway , oiler again lour ( lays to departure time . i ) uring those four days the closeness between them and the sense of poignancy in their love affair got stronger and stronger , like a musical note that is increased and increased in intensity until the glass is ready to tinkle anal ii ak , the ears to begin to scream . It was almost too ranch emotion to stand . Always before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakplant when it was over , finished , when he would know he was going to  | have and go home . It coincided with the point at which he found that that patticnlar girl 's character flaws , neuroses , idiosyncracies , or whatever , were in unequal balance to , too glaring for , a love from him . But this time there did n't seem to be any of that . He had started out ( this time , too ; as cdww . IVs ) wanting not to hurt Carol Abernathy ; and he had wound up at the end wanting not to hurt Lucky Videndi . Was this the basic choice of lo e : choice of who not to hurt ? tic to now they had existed in a sort of midtown lovers ' vacuum which had nothing to do with either of their lives . Now their lives were starting In enure back into it all and take over , as the days passed and he did not postpone again . She would go back to doing whatever she had done be ( ore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would also . You could smell it . There was that feeling in the air . Was it true , Grant wondered , the old saw , the old superstitious myth that said when a man found Something Good and True he must give some token , make some gesture of spiritual Commitment or he would lose it , Inse it forever ? Certainly that feeling was strongly in him . But then he had crls : cys been superstitious anyway . 1 ( o was still receiving phone calls from his foster-mother ' in Miami . She had not gone on to Ganado Bay after all . Most of these he refused to accept when he was at the hotel , which was seldom now , usually only to cic.ucge shirts . But on the day when Lucky came to help him pack to catch the evening train that night , perhaps because he was so nervous and upset to be leaving anyway , the phone rang and inadvertently he picked it up . ticcc lr a loud and insulting volley of hysterical screaming and cursing came out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bedroom of the suite packing his ties must be able to hear it . He made his voice guarded and low , and answered in grunts and monosyllables . ? Yes , he ww as leaving today . ? " And she 's up there right now helping you pack , is n't she ? " the voice said incredibly . " No , " he mumbled . The voice went c , cc . But underneath all his distress and the sub-moronic guilts he could not seem to shake , another emotion was rising in him : he was just getting a bellyful of this ; a hard , mean quality ; and suddenly he just hung up the ' , hone , hung up on her , cut her off . He had never done that in his life fail ore . I , cccky was standing in the bedroom doorway . " Who was it ? " she said 100 ly . But some deep intuitive knowledge shone powerfully on her face ti:ct she had understood it all . " Oh , just some guy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get this over with and get the fuck out of here . " She did n't say a word and went back into the bedroom . It was as if , by  | not retorting , she were deliberately putting herself into the hands of Fate , whatever the odds , sealing her bet for win or lose . When the phone began to ring again just a few minutes later , Grant refused to answer it and became enraged . " Goddam them ! Goddam them ! They all know I 'm leaving ! What the fuck are they all calling now for ! I do n't want to talk on the fucking telephone ! I want to be with you ! " God ! " he growled , with such a violent intensity that it surprised himself , " I hate packing ! I hate it ! I never could stand it ! Come on , let 's get out of this ! How much time have we got ? " " About four hours , " Lucky said in a strangely calm voice . " Let 's go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his eyes that he wanted to make love to her one more time . Leslie would n't be there , was at work at her office . " I 'd rather not , " Lucky said in a voice that was curiously decisive . " Let 's go somewhere and have a drink or two instead . " She went with him to the train . He had checked his bags through early and then walked with her over to Rattazzi 's , which had become a lovers ' hangout for them since he first took her there and where they were known , and where they had four large martinis each , sitting at their own private little table in the back . So they were both a little drunk when they came back two hours later for Grant to board . " I 'll come with you , " Lucky said in a still voice , " if you want me to . " " To where ? Indianapolis ! " It was an idea that had never occurred to him . His jerking mind could not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion all around them , and people pushing . " Sure . Why not ? " she said . " I 'll make the drive to Florida with you and fly back from there . " Grant could n't get used to the idea . He had never done things like that . But he had always wanted to . " Wait a minute , " he said and climbed into the train to put his briefcase on his berth . He came back and hopped off onto the platform . " You have n't got any clothes with you . Anyway , where would I put you ? " " I Invent you got a house out there ? You were telling me all about it the other day . " . ' Sure , hut ? " *  | form with this strangely , incredibly forlorn look on her white face like sonic little lost girl , he on the step , looking at each other , waiting for the door rr to shut , the train to move . " I ca n't take you to Jamaica , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction . " Send me back on a plane from Miami . " Your clothes ? " You can buy me a couple of little dresses . " " I do n't know ? " " Please . " " All right then , come on ! " Lucky took two very hesitant steps forward . " But are you sure ? I do n't want to come if  --  I wo n't push you . " " Well , I  --  I just have n't thought about ? " ' Flue door slid shut in front of his face . He stood looking out at her , an unwlish bursting in him like a small bomb . The train began to move . She ed once , then dropped her hands to her sides and like that same little pi I lost from her parents , she began to cry , then she disappeared from view , cut off by the angle of the glass . Grant felt numb . ' I'liat night he did n't eat but instead got drunk in the club car all by himself . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt strangely aridity.  | SHE DID N'T REALLY KNOW how she got back to the apartment but she assumed she took a taxi since she certainly would n't have ridden the subway . She had only ridden the subway five times in her life , five times in seven years in New York , and that was when she was doing that bit part for Buddy Landsbaum and Don Celt who were shooting it in Brooklyn . She had ridden the subway to Brooklyn five times at four o'clock in the morning to do that job . She did n't really know how she got home , or care , but she knew she had stopped crying right away . She hated crying , and she hated having people , especially strangers , see her cry . She was in a daze , that was the truth , a goddamned fucking daze . She had used up so much emotion in the past weeks , especially in the past few days , that she was as empty , and as ugly inside , as an old cold cream jar . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it until she climbed the ugly dirty stairs and keyed the apartment door open and saw Leslie there , Leslie and Forbes Morgan . Tall , chubby , well-got-up Forbes Morgan . He jumped up off the daybed couch , cutting off in mid-sentence his conversation with Leslie . Forbes Morgan , her stud . Her friendly old stud . Her friendly old ex-stud . He had a very big thing . " 011 , hello , Forbes , " Lucky said lightly . " What brings you over here , uninvited ? " Ile cane toward her his chubby face wryly rueful , and looked at her his eves warmly searching , her face for signs of  --  signs of trouble , she guessed . " I have nw little grapevine , " Forbes said tenderly . " I keep tabs on you , even svin n I do n't see von . He 's gone ? " kv smiled at him . " I ie 's gone . " .. fir 's an oaf , " Forbes said .  | " I guess he 's an oaf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung it in the bedroom closet , and came back and relaxed herself into the big chair which Leslie had tacitly vacated for her . " But he 's also a man . " " Ile sure is that , " Leslie said . " Whew ! " " And a very talented one , " Lucky said . She was feeling bitchy , and ugly . She turned off her ears , and remembered the day , it was the Sunday after the Sunday they met , when he had spent almost the whole day from noon to nearly six o'clock in the evening telling her and Leslie and a couple of the other girls the complex story of his new play . He had talked five solid hours , and had cried real tears at least four times . And had consumed more than half a bottle of whiskey doing it . She had tried writing a play . And spent a year doing it . He was going to have a drinking problem someday if he did n't watch out . She turned her ears back on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all be geniuses , " Forbes said lightly . " And I said I guess it 's just as well ! " Leslie said . She was trying to smile , and to get Lucky to laugh , and was not succeeding very well at either . " I was down near 5th and 48th the other day , down near Gibson and Kline , and I saw him blowing his nose in the street , " Forbes said . " He says blowing your nose in a handkerchief blows the stuff , and the germs with it , back up into your sinuses , " Leslie said . " Even so . But surely you do n't like it ? " Forbes said to Lucky . " No , I do n't like it much , " Lucky said . Suddenly she laughed out loud . She was remembering her consternation the first time he had ever done t hat with her with him . It was that first day , when he came over and they ; ilked down to P. J. Clarke 's . It had certainly startled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stance in the middle of the room . " I guess you know I'iii in love with you , " he said dolefully . " I did n't know , " Lucky said . " I never thought about it . " " Well , I am , " he said . " Then I 'm sorry for you . " " Do n't make fun of me , Lucky . " " I 'm not making fun of you , Forbes . I can hardly think at all . " " That son of a bitch . That son of a bitch . " Forbes pursed his lips . " Then you 're really in love with him . " " I guess I am , " Lucky said simply . " I ca n't seem to help myself . " ' That hick ! Well that 's what I was afraid of . " Forbes Morgan . Old Forbes . He really did have a big thing . Lucky looked at him sorrowfully . She was exhausted . She felt sad for both of thew , herself and Forbes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him  | she was n't in love with him  --  or , well , if she had n't told him , she had certainly given him enough signs along the way so that he ought to have understood that she was n't . Looking up at him , she turned off her ears again . Forbes Morgan of the prolific Morgans . There were so many of the prolific Morgans now that being a Morgan hardly meant anything . Nevertheless Forbes stood to inherit a nice-sized little fortune when his old grandfather died just the same . She had even visited them up there in Connecticut with him one time , and last year , for quite a long time , Forbes ? broke , without a nickel , with hardly a change of his Harvard type clothes  --  had stayed here in the apartment with her and Leslie , sleeping on the daybed couch . She had taken care of him , fed him , kept up his spirits , fucked him , and finally had even gotten him a job because at just about that same time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met Peter Raven and spent a crazy funny wild drunken weekend with him at the Plaza and then had started going out with him too at the same time . Peter Raven , who was married , and was another of those sons of old rich but now broke New England  --  Harvard families ( Les nouveaux pauvres , she called them all ) . He was a top CBS Television executive , and while she was going out with him , after much concentrated arguing , she had finally talked him into hiring Forbes in a good executive job . At one point Peter wanted to leave his wife and marry her , but she had gently without hurting his feelings talked him out of that . Neither man knew she was going out with and fucking the other . This was one of her own private little games , little jokes , that nobody knew about except Leslie and maybe Annie Carler . " So how 's the job ? " she said , turning her ears back on again . It had been a big step up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Peter 's soul . She had n't hurt anyone . Forbes , who ( aware that though she was looking at him she was n't listening ) had turned his conversation slowly around to Leslie , now brought his gaze back to Lucky . " Oh , all right , you know . It 's fun work . Ao ( I I'etcr 's very good to me . We 've become great pals . " 1 , isten , like I said a minute ago , if there is anything anything at all I earl do to ' ease your burden ' as they say , will you tell me ? " " Asa matter of fact , to be honest , there is something you can do for me right now , " Lucky said . " You can go home and leave me alone . Maybe you guessed : I ( loll. ' feel much like talking to anybody tonight . " 1 ' i h s 's face expressed deep hurt . But he swallowed it down manfully . " All right , sweetie . 1 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Just to see how things go ? "  | " I do n't know , " Lucky said despairfully . Forbes really did have a big one . Much bigger than Peter Raven 's . Painfully , she wished Grant were lure right now , instead of him . " I really do n't know . You must sense that I clout really want to look at you right now . " She felt if he did n't get out of here soon , she was going to start to cry again , and she did n't want to . Forbes got his coat . There was silence for quite a while after he left . But the growing pressure to cry began to subside as soon as Forbes was outside the door and was replaced by a deep sense of doom and gloom that was not entirely without its pleasant aspect . Doomed to gloom . They sat on in silence . " 1 ) o you want to talk ? " Leslie said finally . " No l do n't , " Lucky said plaintively . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't , " Leslie said stoutly . " But let me ask just one question , " she added eagerly . " Did he say anything about coming back to New York ? " " Yes . He 's said that several times . He says he 's coming back to me as scorn as this diving junket is over . " ' That 's a strange thing , his feeling about this diving business , and how he has to do it alone , " Leslie said . " Yeah . " I , cslie made a Jewish gesture , not quite a shrug . " What am I going to do ? " Lucky asked her . Again Leslie made the gesture . She pouted out her lips . " I ca n't tell You ... " I le 's very strait-laced and very stern in certain ways , you know , " she said . " Well , naturally ! He certainly is . Which is exactly what you want . I I c n uy , I knew your father ! Remember ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It was yesterday at lunch , at Chanticleer , when he was already getting everything all ready to go , mind you . He said if we did get married , would I sign a waiver on his property and his income . One of those individual property statements , where he keeps what 's his and I keep what 's mine ! " " So what did you say ? " " I said certainly not . I was n't marrying him as an investment , I was marrying him because I wanted to live with him the rest of my life . " " What did he say ? " " Ile did n't say anything . He thought about it . " " Well , at least he 's thinking about marriage seriously , if he 's thinking about his money . "  | " How do I know what that foster-mother of his will say that he lives with out there in Minneapolis ? " " Indianapolis , dear . " " Indianapolis , " Lucky repeated vaguely . The silence reigned again . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He has n't got all that much money . My mother 's got a hell of a lot more than he has . " " Which , I must add , " Leslie said , " does n't do you one damn bit of good . " " That 's true , " Lucky said gloomily . Again the silence fell over them , each of them wrapped up in whatever special thoughts she carried . " Do you remember how we used to talk , kid about him ? " Lucky said finally . " Ron Grant , the last of the unmarried writers ? How we tried to arrange plots for me to meet him ? " " We did n't really try . " " No , but we spent a lot of time laughing and joking about it . Ron Grant , the last gasp , the last chance , the last one left , for me to marry a real writer . " " I never thought you 'd ever really meet him . Let alone really fall in love with him . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucky said , more to herself than to Leslie . " It has to happen . Why , it 's like Fate . I have to believe it will happen . ? If it does n't happen , " she said in a hollow whisper , looking over at Leslie with hollow blue-shadowed eyes , " I do n't know what will become of me . I ca n't marry any of these people . I ca n't go back and marry some durnbhead from Syracuse . " " It 's that kindly fatherly quality about him that sunk us all , " Leslie said , " taking all us girls out to dinner with you like he did , being so nice to us all . Remember the Sunday he told the story of the play ? He really likes girls . " Lucky did n't hear this . She had lapsed into silence , turning off her ears again , and begun thinking about that time , the time when they used to kid about lion as the last of the unmarried writers . It was about a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay had moved in with them . ( : rant was in town then , working with his producers or something . He had even taken a hotel apartment somewhere , and was trying to write there . The grapevine had it that he could n't be doing much serious work what with .111 the heavy drinking and late hours he was keeping , and apparently it was true because after six weeks he packed up and went back to MimicWIwHm or wherever it was . And it was during that time that lie started  | having an affair with an old friend of hers , Hope York , a New Jersey very Jewish girl singer and dancer who had never quite made it big on Broadway . She had n't seen or heard from Hopie in over two years when one day the called and asked if she could come over . When she arrived , it was to speak only about her love affair with Ron Grant the playwright . She was m.0 iv in love with him and wanted to marry him . But he was n't having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her kookiness . She was rrally quite kooky , and kept coming up with weird wayout plots to pressure ( : rant or blackmail him into marrying her . She wanted Lucky 's help . She did not , however many times Lucky and Leslie invited her to , bring ( mart over to the apartment . She would not even say where he was staying , t hough neither of them ever asked her . But it was clearly a closely gu arded secret . Hopie was n't about to set her competition up in business . So they never met him . When he went back home to the Middlewest , Ilopie was distraught and beside herself for two months . It was then that lucky laughingly suggested that they all get together with all the rest of the girls they knew who qualified , and form a Writer Fuckers Club . She sighed . Leslie , who knew well her habit of literally turning off her pars Olen she was thinking , had lapsed into silence too . And suddenly she tht night of Forbes Morgan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe the biggest she had encountered . Except perhaps for Jacques the Haitian. lint it was n't like Grant 's . Nobody 's was like Grant 's . Even though it was only normal sized . She guessed that was love . It was so pretty . " Remember the Writer Fuckers Club ? " Lucky said , and then suddenly she started to cry . She did n't cry like most people , with sobs and shaking shoulders and a screwed-up face , she simply sat motionless with her eyes wide open , breathing evenly but shallowly through a slightly open mouth , and teats ran down her face to splash on her lax hands in her lap , taking a large part of her eye makeup with them . She did n't know why she cried like that . She just always had . Maybe it was because she hated to cry so much that it hurt her more to do it . She felt totally helpless , unable to do a thing . She always had needed somebody to help her and take care of her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , " she said to Leslie . " It 's only seven-thirty , honey . " " I do n't give a damn . If anybody calls for me , I do n't want to talk . I 'm just going to stay in bed . " " For six whole weeks ? Not again , " Leslie said . " I do n't know . Maybe . Where 's that book of Ron 's plays and short stories he gave us ? " Leslie got it for her . " Can I fix you something to eat ? " " I could n't eat anything . " " I wish there was something I could do , " Leslie said . Abruptly Lucky put her arms around her , and they stood together that way , hugging each other . " Ai nt nobody can do nothin for nobody , " she said . " Anyway , you know I 'm here , sweetie , " Leslie said . " Are n't you going out ? " Leslie looked guilty . " I sort of had a date , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't feel like going out . " Lucky did n't answer . Later from the bedroom she heard Leslie 's new boyfriend ring , come in , low voices for a little while , and then go out . She wriggled herself violently further down into pillow and covers so that nothing except her face and the hands which held the book were outside , uncovered . She did not want the cold air of the world to touch her , not one smidgen more of her than was absolutely necessary . Her two hands were a concession she had to make if she wanted to read Ron 's book . Ron . Ron . Ron . Names were so funny . They did n't mean a damn thing , until you met the people attached to them , and then they all seemed to fit and be exactly right . Ron Grant whom she had never met was one name , and Ron Grant whom she knew was a totally different name . He wrote well . Even in his prose short stories . Which were strange introspective pieces almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid the dialogue of plays . He did n't spend much time on delicate stylistic niceties but sort of bullassed right through . But his sensitivity abort the physical world and his perceptions about people were so incredibly sensitized that they were almost feminine , and they made you stop sotn ( tinUS with a feeling of Gee ! I 've felt that ! ' Slue never seen the first play , The Song of Israphael , which was ma b n colossal hit . She had not even been living in New York then , and was still iu school . But whenever she did come into the city she avoided it pimply because it was such a huge hit . If it was such a big hit , how could it be any good ? Now she found that it was good . Very good . Grant 's under-  | Mantling of the whore amounted almost to empathy and astounded her , how could he know that much about women , though when she thought about it , knowing him now , she did not see why it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pause , thinking this writer was the kind of ni , in one would like to know , until she remembered she did know him , and in fact had made violent love with him . When she finished it she put the honk down and covered herself with the covers completely , head and all . After a while she put her head out and called to Leslie , in a plaintive , child 's voice . " I ) o you think he might call me from out there ? " " I ) o you want to talk to him if he does ? " ) f course . " She paused . " What time does the train get in ? " " Around noon , " Leslie called . She wriggled back down into the covers until only her face from eyebrows to mouth was outside . " lint I would n't get my hopes ? " " I'cn not , " Lucky said . She turned on her side and shut her eyes and began going back over the past weeks in her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasurably , just as if everything were all right , and he was here , in the other bed there , beside her , sound asleep . When she woke it was with a definite sense of loss . They had slept together so closely for so long that her body , especially her skin , began missing him , missing his skin , even before her mind was awake enough to appreciate it . There was that way he had of sleeping completely under the covers with his head resting on her flank and one heavy arm lying across her belly as if holding her down . She loved that feeling of being held ( 11 ) 1111 like that , by a man , by a real man . Authority . When she opened her eyes finally , it was mid-morning and the cold heat less winter sun pouring in through the thin curtains carried a sense of uutinnnal stillness in the air outdoors and of a winter loneliness so deep that it froze to the bone . The same light had seemed happy and gay as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her face , she reached out one hand , feeling for the telephone until she found it , and began calling people . She would not even get out of the bed for coffee . Athena Frank , her lawyer friend ; Annie Carler at home ; Leslie at her office . As she talked she pulled lightly at her crotch hair with one hand , opening repeatedly the outer lips of her vagina ever so slightly . As she was Mu fond of saying at parties or wherever else she thought it might shock , her trouble was that at the age of eight she masturbated and liked it . At ten-thirty ( Forbes Morgan called her from his office , and she told him she  | was staying in bed and wanted to be left alone . He must already have been crying on Peter Raven 's shoulder , because a few minutes later he called . " You 're really a cute little dirty rat fink , are n't you ? " his voice came over the wire in that amused wry drawl he affected . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning because he 's in love with you . It turns out he 's been having an affair with you for almost a year . " " It was never an affair . We were merely sleeping together . " But she did n't feel like playing sexy boy-girl games today . " Sure . All during the time I was going out with you . I 've lived in this town long enough that you 'd think I 'd smarten up . And not only that , you had the audacity to ask me for a job for him . And me , I gave it to him ! " " He needed the job . Are you going to fire him ? " " No . As a matter of fact , I could n't fire him if I wanted . He 's been promoted . Only the Big Man himself can fire him now . " " It was good for you to give him the job , " Lucky said . " Sure . It sure was . And the whole thing was very good for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ? " Lucky knew she was supposed to laugh here , but she did n't feel up to it . " At least I did n't tell your wife the story , " she said tartly . " No . That 's true . I do owe you that , " the amused voice drawled . " Only it might have been good for her . If you had . " " Listen , Peter , I do n't feel much like talking , " she said . The whole thing bored her , made her sick , even frightened her . She was tired of this life , and all these smart hip chic people who ran the nation 's thinking for the advertisers . She simply could n't go on like this . Not now . " So he 's got you over a barrel , the playwright , " Peter gloated . " I hope he 's as hard on you as you were on everybody else . " " You do n't really mean that , Peter , do you ? " " No . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now go back to sleep . I 'll call you maybe tomorrow . " She did n't even bother with saying bye ' as she hung up . Underneath everything else , under the electric skin contact she felt for Grant , under the deep passion of their actual lovemaking , below and under the deep desperation she felt about her life with him gone , was still something else . It was hard to even find words for it . Sometimes she was n't even sure it was there . It was so deep down . Mainly it was a feeling , a superstitious feeling that she would he punished . Punished for what ? Hell , take your pick . Anything . You could say punished for her past ' . Whatever . A superstition that she would be punished by not being allowed to have Ron  | ( ; r:i ( it , now that she had found him . She had heard the old soldier 's cynical saving that Whores make the best wives ' . And probably they did . Anything to get out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r , n ) ( 1 wife . But that superstitious feeling of getting punished was still there ; anyway , sometimes it was there . That goddamned fucking Catholic , il , bringing that she had tried and striven so hard to rid herself of ; super-s t i t ion was still there . I f she did n't hate praying and the idea of praying so much , she 'd by Cod pray . I lis phone call came in just a few minutes before one . He had , he said , taken a cab straight home from the station and called her . When she heard that raspy , deep , husky , fatigued voice over the phone the pit of her stomu ( h dropped completely out from under her . " Cct on a plane and come , " he was saying . " We 'll stay here in Indianapolis two or three days . Then we 'll make the trip to Florida together . I 'll sell ( I you home from Miami . " " I do n't know how to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never know how to do anything like that ! " " Well ? Get Leslie to help you . I hate telephone conversations , damn it . I hate them . Nobody ever understands anybody . I wish you were here right now . " " I have n't got any money , " Lucky was able to say finally , though it hurt her to . ' I'l ( ere was a pause . " Well , I 'll send you a couple hundred bucks . That ought to be enough , had n't it ? I 'll wire it . I 'll send it Western Union . To your address . All right ? " " Yes , " Lucky said . " Yes , darling . Anything . " Her whole intestinal and pelvic area was melting into a frothy cream of butter . Her legs had gone too weak to stand up . She spread them apart and let herself come open . If only she could have him here right now . If only I could have you here right now , " Grant 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Okay ? " " Yes , yes . " " Okay . Goodby . " " Goodby , Ron . " But neither one of them hung up . She could hear a sort of agonized brcail ( ing from the other end . Neither spoke . " Goodby again , " Grant said finally , and the phone clicked dead in her car . ' rears brimming in her eyes she put it back in its cradle .  | She lay still for a few minutes thinking about him . Then she threw back the covers , and everything began to run too fast , like a movie film played at a speed faster than normal . At five-thirty in the afternoon she was at Idlewild boarding a plane . Somewhere in the confusion she had got stuck in her head that it was to Minneapolis , Indiana , that she was going . But fortunately Leslie , whom she had called and who had come home from the office to help her , had bought the right ticket and steered her to the right boarding passage . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him into driving them out . The two of them waved her on board . In such ways did people begin to change their lives , or try to . Change them upside down and all around until they did n't even look like the same lives . On the plane , she prepared herself for three hours of doing nothing but think . Even while he was so sweetly and kindly driving her to the airport with Leslie , Lucky had had nothing but contempt for Forbes Morgan . What kind of a man was it that would drive a girl he had been fucking and was in love with out to the airport to go and meet another lover ? How could any real girl love a man like that ? That was the trouble with all these people , they were all so kind and good and liberal and up-to-date and modern , they could no longer function as simple males . Victims of their own liberal ' propaganda . Treat girls as equals . But it was n't only that . Underneath that was a still deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this hugely organized business of controlling the minds of the people for the sellers of products , whether in the advertising end or in the actual communication  --  TV , radio , publishing  --  had shriveled their souls , if not their testicles as well , until each man became somehow less of himself than when he started , in some strange way nobody could define . This did n't seem to happen to the lawyers and accountants and bookkeepers and simple office workers . The diminishment seemed to take two forms . There were those who came to believe ardently in the stuff , largely junk , which they sold . And there were those who became totally cynical about it all . These were the ones who drove sports cars in rallys , flew their own planes , or became amateur bullfighters , or skied or mountainclimbed . All , both types , became ardent girl-chasers , even the impotent ones . Perhaps the intensive , vicious competition had something to do with it , too . I  --  ven a man as highly placed as Peter Raven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fucked up on one single big account . And their manhood suffered . Like poor old Forbes . I.neky renumbered , by contrast with Forbes , the tune Raoul had left  | her stashed in Kingston to go back into South America to mess around with his revolution he could not leave alone . It was like dope to him . After six weeks of it she had been bored , and had taken up with a handsome young Jamaican guy . Although he was really far too light to be called a black Negro ( almost all the upper class Jamaicans were mulattoes , quadroons , octoroons or less ) , and although his body hair though kinky was reddish in color , Jacques still qualified sufficiently for her to be able to think of him as her Negro lover ' . Anyway , esthetically , their bodies were beautiful together in the mirror ; he was dark enough for that . In any case , whether Raoul had been told about it or had come back on his own and guessed what was going on , he packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York so fast it made your head swim . She and Leslie had giggled about it for a long time . What would Forbes have done ? She was reasonably certain that Grant would never have driven her out to any airport to go off to another lover . Or would he ? He seemed to keep sending her back all the time , sending her back to the apartment from the train , and now sending her back to New York from Miami . But he had called her to come out . She was pretty sure , if they really did make the drive to Miami , she could talk him into taking her on to Kingston with him . And that myth about Negroes having bigger things than white men , if her Jamaican boyfriend Jacques was any example , was not a myth at all . lty contrast , Raoul 's had been very ordinary . They had giggled about that , too . A hysterical laughter began to bubble up inside of her , rising out of leer inability to cope with or accept appreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it was like spending a Saturday afternoon with The Perils of Pauline . When a man across the aisle tried to strike up an acquaintance , she closed her eyes and pretended to sleep , trying to keep from breaking out into uproarious crazy laughter . Then , suddenly , there rose up in her again the awful doom-gloom sense t t she would be punished by not being allowed to have Grant . She could not open her eyes because of the man across the aisle , so she sat with it in the ( lark behind her eyelids , trying to make it go away . I lc met her at the scary modern steel-and-glass numbered entrance portal as she came in off the field of the big new modern airport , and in the confusion of noise , flashing bright lights , shrieking conversations and reverberating footfalls in the hollow corridor there began for her a peculiar dreamlike sequence of unreality that did not leave her until she boarded the New York jet in Miami ten days later . In the confusion she was  | convinced for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconvinced her , that she was for some reason in a town called Minneapolis . He took her right away upstairs to the handsome modern bar for a drink , where they sat looking at each other as they downed it . Grant was wearing levis , cowboy boots and a leather jacket . Then he drove her out to his home through the city . It was a much bigger town than Lucky , who had never been west of Harrisburg , Pa. , except once to fly to California , had anticipated . They spent three wonderful lovers ' days there , in his house , never going out , cooking together , watching television , playing ping-pong or pool in the gameroom , reading , making love . He had completely done over the old house and it had a huge stone fireplace , books everywhere on all the walls , glass cases of guns and fishing and camping gear . It very definitely bore the impress of his personality , and it constricted Lucky somewhat to see that he had very definitely built himself a very definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he take her out . This was the third night when he took her to dinner at a fairly ritzy countryclub , which seemed pretty much like her hometown one in Syracuse and in fact seemed to be pretty much furnished with the same people  --  all of whom looked at her with surprise ( and with admiration , she noted ) . Grant , as he introduced her and showed her around , seemed to be wearing a sort of subdued belligerence , as if he were doing something he did not particularly like to do but that he had promised himself he would do . Then the drive began . It took them a full six days . Down through Indiana and across the Ohio at Henderson , Kentucky , where the snow slowly began to disappear and they began to be in the South . The close , fetid air of commingled lechery and hatred which became apparent to her as soon as they crossed the river affected her so strongly that it took her breath away and made her sick at her stomach , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became . The cold and at the same time obscenely lecherous eyes of the tall paunchy men who looked at her lewdly made her skin creep . She knew they hated all women . But when she mentioned this to Grant , he merely laughed . And when they stopped off at a few places to eat with people Grant knew , everyone was very nice . The women that she met seemed to her peculiarly two-faced in some mincing way , as thongli they all knew something about the men that they were not teltin ; , something they did not need to tell because as long as they knew it and did n't tell it , it aided them . It was the most Lucky had ever seen of the actual earth of the great  | Nation she belonged to , and it all made her want to get back to New York as fast as possible and stay there and never leave . As they drove , they talked and talked and talked . By the time they reached the Florida state line near Tallahassee they knew just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his career ' in the Navy during the war , and how he had gotten himself transferred from a nice safe clerical job at Pearl Harbor to duty on board an aircraft carrier which lie was subsequently blown off of into the Pacific Ocean . " My God , why did you do all that ? " IIe snarled . " I did n't know any fucking better . I would n't do it now . I was trying to escape from petty bureaucracy ' . What I found was the same bureaucracy plus danger . " For her part Lucky told him about her horrible convent childhood , and how her father saved her from it . " He was really a great man . Even when l was only five he told me to listen to what they said , but believe what I wanted. , " " Well , was n't he a Catholic himself ? " " Nominally , yes . But he believed they were in business like everybody else . Like every ideology . " At which Grant roared . Finally , after some hesitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she must have had some boyfriend before she met him , she told I i i i n about her stud Forbes Morgan , how she had gotten him a job , about how Forbes had driven her to the airport and how she felt about it . " I never was really in love with him . I never was really in love with anybody hut you , that 's the truth . Not even Raoul . " Grant listened politely , without anger , but there was such a strained look on his face that she decided not to tell him everything about Peter Raven , only that he was an admirer , another guy who was trying to make her . Then it was suddenly late at night with the glow of Miami on the Eastern sky as Grant herded the big Chrysler convertible across the ghostly , haunted Everglades toward it . They had had five further nights together in various hotels and motels along the road . They spent the last night in a middleclass motel across the Boulevard from the canal , and by noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did not protest further . His face was set in a peculiarly stubborn way and she knew it would be useless . " I have some things to take care of before we can think of getting married , among them this diving business and the problem of courage . " As she fastened her seatbelt and looked out the port she could see the tiny figure still standing way off there  | on the ramp and knew that if he did n't hurry up he would miss his own flight to Jamaica . She was aware that people around her were looking at her , after the wild kiss of their farewell , and she set herself not to cry . At Idlewild Leslie met her with a taxi and she went straight home to bed , and stayed there . Only once in the next days did she get up , and that was when her uncle Frank Videndi , a big horseplayer , came to town . Somehow he knew she was in trouble and took her to the Copa with a couple of his cronies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked her what was the matter . So she told him .  | ' l'iE ABERNATRYS had met him at the Ganado Bay Airport . There was no reason to assume they would not meet him , since he had wired them his arrival time , but when Grant saw them standing there together in the hot sun on the ramp he was disappointed . The muggy tropical Jamaican heat flowed into the big jet like a salty molasses as soon as the door was cicc.scaled . Even the air itself smelled different , like holidays . But he needed more time . With a sinking feeling he felt that he was in fact sinking ? sinking back into a rhythm , a part of his life that no longer suited or fit . A l ter Lucky , after New York this time , everything was different . He could still taste on his moustache all the secret places of that lovely body . He could still remember how her plane had got off the ground and had so achingly disappeared northward in the blue Florida sky . They even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And for another , they looked to him now , suddenly , like exactly what they were : Hicks . Two hicks . And Grant realized suddenly that this was a thought he had been avoiding thinking for quite a long time . Why ? Becal Ise he had thought it was too cruel a thought to admit , was that why ? There had been a time , back when he first got out of the Navy and came home and first met them , that he had thought they were the two most svvorlclly and sophisticated people he could ever meet . But they had n't gone on . He had gone on and had been going on , for quite a long time now , lie just had not found up to now an idea , a place to go on to . he had had to force himself to get out of the seat , to descend the steps into the heat , and when they waved at him  --  Hunt with his perpetually friendly way , she with that false smile he had gotten to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climb right back into the jet . Through passport checking , through customs , through the little glass of rum punch the  | pretty colored girl from the Chamber of Commerce offered him , he felt as though he were leaning backward : moving forward while straining to go rearward ; and then he was with them . He had had nothing at all to say . And it had gone on like that for days . It did not really matter that he had had nothing to say . Carol had immediately taken over and begun to run things . There was this diver in town she had found for him , his name was Al Bonham , and when they got his wire she had arranged for him to have his first diving lesson in a pool tomorrow . She would go with him , and learn it too . And she did . Fortunately , though she was a good swimmer , better than Grant actually , she proved to be totally unable to cope with anything having to do with a mask or an aqualung . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she could not let water into her mask and clear it underwater without choking . It was as if some terrible claustrophobic fear struck her that she could not control the moment she put her face underwater in a mask and she would stand up in the pool gasping and coughing , she who was always talking about mind control ' , and after the first day she quit , leaving him alone and relieved with the big diver , Bonham . These were about the only times he was alone and away from her . But before all this happened they had had their first conversation alone together . She could not , naturally , say anything while Hunt was around . This was another part of all their lives together that Grant had somehow come to accept , and now no longer wanted to accept . But Hunt was playing golf today at the local club with Paul de Blystein and some other businessmen ' he had found around . He already had his clubs in the car with him . Grant had known a confrontation scene would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Apparently he was not to have it . Hunt had dropped them at the front portal ( that was the only thing to call it ; it was much too big to be called a door ) of Evelyn de Blystein 's huge magnificent villa and had driven off . Neither , of course , could she talk in front of Evelyn . But after the necessary fifteen minutes and two drinks of amenities and hellos ; after giving his bag to the Jamaican maid to unpack in his room , he and Carol had walked down the hill through the unbelievably beautiful grounds to Evelyn 's private beach and beachhouse across the Jamaican ' highway ' for a swim . She did not say anything going down the hill , and she did not take his bond as she might once have done under these same circumstances . Grant wu.r grateful for that , but he felt it was all very painful .  | " So , " she said finally after they had crossed the road and were wading through the deep sand in the hot sun toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't know what you 're talking about , " he had said . Carol snarled . " The fuck you do n't ! " It was like the face of some animal . She was probably right there in that goddamned hellish New Weston hotel room with you all those times I was calling you , or trying to call you . l ni positive she was ! " ( : rant did not answer and plodded on . He had changed to what in the old days in the Navy at Pearl Harbor they had called a gook ' shirt and a 1p.iir of shorts and carried his bikini in his hand . In the pocket of the shirt he had put an undeveloped roll of color film with a few shots he had taken of I , reeky on the trip down . He owned an Exacta single lens reflex . Actually , he had taken the precaution of removing the film from the camera and carrying it with him because he knew Carol Abernathy was not above blatantly and openly going through his things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do anything about it . " What 's that ? " she asked suddenly . " In your pocket . " " Roll of film , " he had said . And suddenly , so fast and unexpectedly that he had n't even had time to move , Carol had snatched the roll from the pocket , ripping the pocket slightly , and thrown it out across the beach into the sea . " Well you wo n't have that ! " she said viciously . " That much is gone ! " She f n ed him defiantly , her head thrown back , as though expecting him to hit her or slap her , which in fact he had actually been thinking of doing . Grant shrugged and made a face . " I know they were pictures of her , it was pictures of her , was n't it ? " Carol demanded . " Now you 'll never know , will you ? " Grant had said . He felt cruel . First rid anger , then white fury boiled up inside his head , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some planned campaign to go  --  get back ? to what had been before , and he would n't put it past her , to have planned it all , she was certainly going about everything exactly wrong . They were almost to the lovely little coral-stone beachhouse . " I 'm thinking of bringing her down and taking her to Kingston with me , " he said with deliberate malice . Ile had no intention of doing that . But he did n't intend to take ( ; ; m i either . Carol stopped . " You wo n't ! You 'll not ! You will over my dead body ! " She was almost screaming and her fists were clenched against her thighs . " I did n't spend the best years of my life bringing you up and teaching you  | and making a man out of you for you to go off to Kingston with a little hotassed floozy ! I 've got a big investment in you ! I made you ! " Grant had stopped , too . The tropical sun broiled down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him really , had really helped him so much ? Hunt perhaps because he was forced to by Carol , at least at first ; Carol because she believed in him and had been in love with him . He owed them a lot . But he did n't owe them that . The truth was that while he had gone on working and learning and growing , all on his own because they could n't follow him , Carol had either given up or simply been unable to follow , and had moved on further and further into her lazy , easy-topretend-to-study mysticism . He had charge of his craft now . And the talent , such as it was , and it was n't at all too bad , was his . She worked by rote , chartclass ideas , usually ideas he had come up with , utilized , passed on to her , then abandoned for something newer while she clung on and on to them . And sold them like a philosophy to her little theater gang . " You 'll get your share , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me . " Stubbornly , like a man in a driving rainstorm , he had turned and plodded on for the beachhouse . It was that question of courage ' , what he had said to Lucky that last day in Miami , though he was sure he had worded it so obscurely that she did n't understand and thought it applied to the diving . At least , he hoped so . He was n't even sure that he wanted to marry her . Sometimes he thought he did , and sometimes he did n't . He did n't know , that was the truth . He was still afraid she was too good to be true . But that was beside the point of courage . He had to do something about this , and he had to do it soon . But he wanted to do it graciously , if he could . That was why he had made that point of taking her out to the Indianapolis country club where he and the Abernathys belonged . If they had n't heard about it in a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him do that , anything else would have been sneaking and anyway people knew he had her there anyway . What the hell ? He opened the door of the exquisitely appointed little beachhouse , which appeared very dark inside after the bright sun outside . I t was n't the first time she had acted this way . She had pulled the same routine before , over other women . She did n't like to sleep with him , but she did n't want anybody else to . What he hated was her way , her trick of always making him appear morally wrong . It was moral for her not to want to sleep with him ; but it was immoral for him to sleep with anybody else , Christ , that shit went out with Queen Victoria . She did n't even believe it herself . Frustration and fury began to burn in him again . She *  | lied to Hunt and living as his , Grant 's , mistress ! For fourteen years ! The Irrationality of it was insane ! Comparing Carol Abernathy with Lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any possible stretch of the imagination  --  where Carol could even compete , let alone come off better . In the ( Ian circular room he had begun to undress . I t was strange . Thinking back all those years to when it began , he did not even seem to be the same man . It had n't even started as a love affair . I t had started as a lark , not a serious affair ' . He had been home on a short convalescent furlough from the Great Lakes Hospital and somebody had taken him down to their house . The war was not yet over even in Europe and she was entertaining all the wounded crapped-out vets , of which there was not such a huge preponderance as later . Naturally there was a hit of drinking . She did not drink , but Hunt did and seemed to like getting drunk with the kids , who contrary to the mythology were not only not taciturn about their war experiences but in fact talked about damned little else . She was already interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of his young , bad poetry about being blown off the carrier into the Pacific and a couple of lousy one-acters , and the third time out he had made her . They were in her car , driving home from somewhere in the afternoon , Hunt was in his office at work , and they had driven out of town and parked in a wood and done it for the first time in the back seat . But for him it had been only a temporary lark , not any kind of idea for a ' permanent relationship ' . He already had two girls going for him in Chicago , and was fucking everything he could get his hands on then . He had been too near dead too long , and he wanted everything he could get . And he did n't care if everybody else felt that way , either . There was a young Navy fighter pilot , a jg named Ed Grear , who was home on leave too and hung around down there , and who also had the hots for Carol Abernathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though Grant was an enlisted man and Grear an officer , they hung around a lot together , drinking , because they had played bad football together in high school , and they had already traded off two or three other girls in town . Carol had a pregnant girl staying with her who was eight months along , a distant relative from somewhere who had come there to her to hide and have her baby , and she was one of the girls they had traded off with . One night lying drunk on the living room floor and necking with Carol , while Hunt was drunk in bed asleep , Grear ( who was later shot down in the Philippines ) had passed by on his way upstairs with the pregnant girl and Grant had signaled him to conic hack down and switch places if he wanted to . Grear did come down , but he did n't stay . Carol was n't having any . She had seen Grant signal , and while she said nothing then , the next afternoon ( while Hunt was  | again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant . He had had no idea that she did n't feel as free and easy about it all as he did . It was an episode she had never let him forget , and on certain occasions recalled it to him as the basic cause for her later disinterest with sex . She implied she had slept with several other men besides him over the early years of their affair , usually in deliberate revenge , but by that time Grant ( who in his heart could never be quite sure she was n't also sleeping with Hunt occasionally , too ) did n't care , since he was reasonably sure that if she did she still could n't be giving very much away . And yet he had loved her , later , loved her desperately . At one point . If he was to be totally coldblooded honest about it , and he wanted to , he had to admit that when he really loved her was when the economic factor became involved , and they were supporting him . It was all so strange . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtfully at the torn pocket of the gook shirt before he laid it aside . Carol had quieted down completely when she caught up to him and came inside . Silently , they undressed together like old intimates in the dim domelike room to put on their swimming suits , and she seemed quite friendly and kind . She actually talked and acted as if there had been no scene . That in itself was peculiar , was n't it ? he thought . Then suddenly , standing nude in the center of the dim room , she looked over at Grant and spread her hands . " Look at my figure , " she said in a shy , half-embarrassed voice which carried a thin , and for Grant bitter , edge of hopefulness . " I lost a lot of weight for you . I ? " Then she paused , embarrassment on her face . " But my breasts got smaller . I do n't know why . They never did before when I dieted . " Her face was very vulnerable . Grant was horrified by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help but compare her to the beauty of Lucky , who not only had a lot of youth and years on her side but also natural endowment . Carol had been a beautiful , a very attractive woman when he first met her , but never anything like Lucky . And her breasts had shrunk . " They look just the same to me , " he had said shaking his head . What else was one to say ? To his further horror , he saw a small smug selfsatisfied smile of secretive triumph come over her face as she lowered her eyes and began to step into her suit , as if she assumed automatically that he really meant what he had said and therefore that she had won back everything . It was n't really so much diet , " she said primly , still looking down , " as worry . " It was a vast relief to get outside . In the eyecracking sun there was a  | lovely little sand terrace held in by a wall of coral-stone with steps down Into the water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the trades breeze above a coral-stone picnic table , and on the sand itself was a tall royal palm . Evelyn de Blystein treated herself right with her Ilaaley , and for a moment he envied her angrily . The water was green and ten or twelve feet deep over a sand bottom running out a couple hundred yards past three big rocks to a reef so shallow the troughs between the surface waves exposed it . It looked interesting but he had no mask with him and anyway he did n't feel much like exploring it right now . When he did swim out to it and looked down through the sting and blur with unmasked eyes , he saw that the entire reef as far as he could see was olive with a forest of sea anemones waving their tiny tentacles in the wash hungrily . He did n't want to get into that , even with a mask . In amongst them he could see here and there the long black spines of the black sea urchin , Diadema setosum , moving pugnaciously about like sharp black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little wharf , where Carol was . It was a good place for a lazy , pointless , profitless mini . But it was not to end there . After showering , she had lain down nude on the big ample oversized lad and called to him . Grant felt he could not refuse her . It would be too terrible . Again he was struck with horror at his own coldbloodedness as he went to her . Her body felt alien to him as if he had never touched it 1 ) cf()re . She must have sensed this . But if she did , she said nothing . 1 lc slept with her only one more time after that , and that was the night after his first dive in the sea with Bonham , the day they went to the big cave . Ile had no idea of course , then , that first day in Evelyn 's beachhouse , that exactly twenty-one days later he would be desperately calling Lucky in New York to come down . But a lot of other things were to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea with Bonham he shot his first fish . Bonham had sold him a double-rubber Arbalete which he also put on Grant 's mounting tab , warning him that until they went after really big fish he should cock only one rubber . They went about three miles west along the coast , where Bonham said there were really fish . " You 'll find spearfishin a helluva lot more fun than just pokin around on the shallow reef , " he said with his bloodthirsty smile . A mile off shore there was a deep reef which was too deep for the native kids to spearfish , and since the depth was 75 to ioo feet neither of the other two pro divers in Ganado Bay took their clients there . Neither did Bonham usually , but since Grant was doing so well , he did n't see why he should n't take him . " You 're lucky you catch onto things so quick , " he rumbled . Grant remembered that Bonham had said there were lots of fish on the shallow reef ' too , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing everything in his power to make sure his rich playwright stayed interested . It was only a long time later , when Grant knew a lot more , that he realized Bonham might have been pushing the safety factor to a fine edge by taking him so deep on his second day out . But by then it did n't matter anyway . Ile never did know just when he began to feel at ease underwater . Suddenly one day it was just there : confidence . But it was certainly not on that second day , when he was at least as nervous as he had been on the first day . Dressing out was more familiar now . So was the crashing fall over the side and under , and the descent . Poking his head around a coral hillock down on the bottom , he saw a large grouper ( it turned out to be only 6 Ibs ) just sitting there in the water and staring at him . Pushing the spear-  | gun slowly forward until it almost touched the fish , who simply stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , he pulled the trigger and put the spear through him just at the lateral line behind the head breaking his back . The fish hardly moved , but with the spear through him and the hinged barbs holding him securely he rolled his eyes and opened and closed his mouth in some silent fish 's agony of his own . I bolding the gun at arm 's length and trailing the fish at the end of spear and double length of line , just in case there were any sharks or other predators around , Grant swam up with him feeling like a brute and a murderer . rderer . But if he felt like a murderer , Bonham did not . He had towed along a small plastic dinghy in which to dump the fish ( " Get them up and out of the water as fast as you can , and try for brain shots , " he grinned ; " it 's the llappin around and the blood spoor that brings the sharks . " ) and in it , by the time Grant got his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n. n . And watching the big man from the surface , as he drove in viciously alter still another , a large grouper , was like watching the predatoriness of some primordial sub-human hunter with his blood up going after a deer . It was a thrill , in a way , but it was scary . When the big man surfaced with the new fish ( a 15 pounder , it turned out ) , he was grinning that bloodthirsty , blackcloud grin of his . He went back down immediately . Grant did not find it all that easy the rest of the afternoon , and in a way he was just as glad . He could not get the picture of that liquid-eyed fish gaping in agony out of his mind . And yet underneath all that , he discovered a savage joy in it , too . The savage joy did n't help him , however . He fired about six more times at fish and missed each time . The fish seemed to have a peculiar habit of flicking themselves away , with that incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short distances , just at the exact moment when he pulled the trigger . Bonham seemed able to anticipate this and shoot a split second faster . When they had finished and were running home with Ali the helper at the wheel and had gotten the gin bottle out , Bonham seemed peculiarly t iced , even depressed . " Cod , I love spearfishin ! " he said with his thundercloud grin , leaning back against the gunnel after a pull at the bottle . " I did n't mean to run off mid leave you like that . " He paused luxuriously . " But you did all right by yourself , did n't you ? " " I got one , " Grant said . " I loved it . But it seems kind of a shame , kind of unsporting , to shoot them like that , in a lung , with so little on their side . "  | " Are you kidding ? " Bonham looked at him blackly , as if he 'd been insulted . " We could n't even get down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why they 're so unspoiled and easy . But they wise up fast . The word goes out that there 's some kind of predator loose on the reef , do n't ask me how , and they all begin to run . They communicate , do n't ever worry about that . And anyway , if we did n't get them , something else would , eventually . That 's the life of the sea . It 's worse than any ' jungle ' . " " It sure is . But I thought some divers could actually freedive that deep ? " Grant asked . " Sure . And even more . You mean like the Pindar brothers . But they 're specialists . In just that . I can do sixty feet , but I 'm not sure I can do eightyfive . Anyway , why give them a break ? " He seemed totally disinterested in the fish , which now rode along behind them in the dinghy , and asked Grant if he wanted them . By rights they were his , since he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't eat that many , " Grant protested . " But I would like two or three good ones to take home . " " " They 're yours , " Bonham said . They would feast at the villa tonight , and not on boughten fish , on fish speared by Grant the hunter . " I 'd like to have the one I shot , " he said with an embarrassed smile . It was the smallest . Bonham grinned suddenly , and then displayed that surprising sensitivity Grant found him capable of so often . " Hell , take three big ones and tell them you shot all three . What difference does it make ? " Or was it just vast experience ? Grant made an embarrassed shrug . " What 'll you do with the rest ? " Bonham 's eyes filmed over slightly . " Sell ' em . In the Market . If you do n't want ' em . But understand that they 're yours if you want them . Lots of times clients do n't want that much fish , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little change that way . " " I only shot one anyway , " Grant said modestly . " Does n't matter . They belong to you . Because you 're paying me for the trip , the use of the equipment , and the instruction . " Grant shook his head politely . He did n't really understand this big man . Yet . Bonham shrugged . Okay , then he 'd sell them . He was n't a bit above selling them . Bonham , it appeared , was having troubles of his own . And after the question of the fish was settled , he discussed them with Grant on the rest of the tun back iii .  | tlrilike Grant , his troubles were not with women . The camera case he laid tried out yesterday ( the films of Grant were n't developed yet ) had been designed and built by a friend of his here in Ganado Bay , an American , vlro was one of the best underwater case makers in the whole of the Car ! Ma'am Bonham sold them for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because he worked only in the best plastic plate and did it all by hind , and he could n't make very many except on order , and this limited Bonham 's chances at sales . Most beginning divers could n't afford to lay nut that much for a case , especially if it also meant buying a new camera . Most vacationers already owned a camera , usually a model for which William had not yet designed a case ; and they usually did n't stay long enough for him both to design and make a case , thus losing Bonham other sales . Anyway , in four or five days , he and William would be flying over to ( : rand Bank Island to test out still another new case which William had designed for the German Minox , and Grant was free to come on and go tilting if he paid his own expenses . The Minox case was Bonham 's idea . They had found that lots of vacationers , at least those that began learning diving with Bonham , owned a Minox , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mm . And of course it was much cheaper , both camera and case . " lint why are you going to Grand Bank to test it ? " Grant asked . Bonham grinned . " Because a rich guy I know is stayin there . And if it works , he wants to buy one right away ; that one . Camera and all . " He seems+d to pause , rather than to finish . ( : rand Bank Island was a small coral and sand atoll located at the very % n i t hem tip of the Bahamas , about halfway between Greater Inagua and the Caicos a hundred miles to the southeast . That put it only another hundred miles from both Mouchoir Bank and the Silver Shoals . Shaped rather like an exclamation point , it possessed one town at its wider end and it deep lagoon at the other where several ancient galleons were rewed to have sunk although so far nobody had ever found any trace of them . I t was three miles long , was covered with brush and a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one road which ran from the town , a wide-open free port under the Bahamas Commission , to its one moderately luxurious hotel which was situated on the lagoon . It had no air strip and could be flown to only by a flying boat service which landed on the lagoon . Grant had never seen it but he had read about it in several try asnre hunting  --  diving books . " lint that 's not the only reason , " Bonham went on finally . He paused again , and in the breeze that had dried them rubbed a huge hand lightly  | over his vast expanse of hairy stomach . " See , there 's this great two-masted schooner just been put up for sale in Kingston a few months ago . Sleeps six plus two crew , sixty-eight feet overall . The Naiad . " He paused still again , and tried another tack . " See , I taught this rich guy  --  Sam Finer is his name  --  to dive last year when he was stayin in one of the big beach hotels here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with diving . So much that he 's thinkin of puttin money into my business , just to have a good boat available for him whenever he wants to go on divin trips . " It turned out to be a lot more complex than that as Bonham went on explaining , but the essential point in his trip to Grand Bank was to see Sam Finer about the schooner . Finer , who was not Jewish but a stocky little German ( though that made no difference at all to Bonham ) , was from Milwaukee where he owned two good-paying bars as well as three tavern-hotel-fishing resorts up in northern Wisconsin . He spent his summers fishing in his own resorts and drinking in his own taverns , and he would eventually like to find something of the same sort in the Caribbean to go into , where he could spend his winters diving . Behind the bars and the resorts was something else about stone quarries both for cement and dressed stone which he owned . Anyway , he was willing  --  or just about willing  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business here . However , as everybody concerned knew , $10,000 was n't enough to buy and fix up a good boat big enough for two- and three-week diving cruises between islands . So in this connection , Bonham had come up with something else . Grant thought he had never seen such unconscious hunger on anyone 's face as appeared on Bonham 's big mug when he digressed a moment to talk about the schooner before going on to his something else ' he had come up with ' . Obviously it had to be totally unconscious hunger , or Bonham would have hidden it . The something else was a potential partner named Frankie Orloffski . Bonham it turned out had been born and raised on the South Jersey Shore , where he had sailed and fished all his life before becoming a skin diver after the war , and on a visit home to see his mother ( a peculiar look came over his big tough mug when he mentioned his mother , whom he capitalized with his voice ) he had met this Polack guy who owned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also owned a thirty-eightfoot Bermuda cutter with which he was trying to build up a business of diving cruises , but it was tough sledding because even cruising as far south as Hatteras ( which was really outside his comfortable range ) the water was cold and murky , ugly diving water . Orloffski , when Bonham met him , was wanting to move south , maybe to Miami . Bonham , who had  | /pent two years trying the same thing in Miami , was able to tell him the Atlantic waters off Miami were not really much better than Orloffski 's own , and suggested they might go in together in Ganado Bay , which was practically virgin territory compared to Miami or the Keys . They would have no competition , the single-master would make a good short cruise boat as well as a fine work boat for real underwater jobs , and if they could only swing the schooner through Sam Finer coming in on it they could cruise the Caymans and even beat up the Windward Channel to cruise the Inagnas , Grand Bank and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inn ? the biggest charter thing on this island . Bonham would put in his two small boats , all his gear , his building , his Ihig compressors ( the purchase and transportation of which was his biggest single investment , worth almost as much as the cutter ) , and last but not least his knowhow , the good will he had accrued here , and his already growing business . hrankie Orloffski would put in his Bermuda cutter , and a minimum of $ti , 000 for running capital from the proceeds of the sale of his sports shop . I Icaring such knowledgeable business words and phrases come out of the mouth of the big diver made Grant feel distinctly peculiar , as if somehow he had not gotten himself outside the doors of Gibson &; Kline after all . Bonham had arranged for Orloffski to meet Sam Finer in New York when Sam was on a business trip and now Orloffski and his wife ( his girl really ; since he was only living with her ) were going to be in Grand Bank to() for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and his wife ) , and the y could all talk business over the bar . Apparently Sam and Orloffski I1n*1 hit it off together in their New York meeting . The trip would be expensive for both Bonham and Orloffski , but Bonham had high hopes of them swinging the deal with Finer for the schooner . " Of course , that wo n't take care of it all . We 'll have to mortgage to get the schooner going . But at least we 'll have it then . A year , two at the most , should pay it out in full . " Again that greedy , almost insane look of totally unconscious hungerwhi ( li would brook no interference , allow no stopping anywhere short of the goal : The Schooner  --  came over Bonham 's cloudlike countenance . Ile began to talk about it again . He had gone over her pretty carefully where they had her moored out at Sanderson 's near Port Royal on the spit . Had flown down to Kingston especially for that . She had some bad dryrot lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowsprit or replacing it , and some of the deck planking was going bad  | near the stern , but she was in pretty good shape  --  very good shape , for a ship that had been owned by an oil company to take out executive weekend sailors . Of course she would have to be pulled and her hull gone over completely . There would be a good bit of yardwork to pay for . But .. . " Do you know what I could do with a boat like that ? " he said almost viciously after a pause , staring pale-eyed off across the never-quite-quiet sea . " I could  --  I 'd be safe the rest of my life . Nobody could touch me . If I owned a boat like that . I hate companies . All they do is destroy . Destroy all the old ways and the old things . Destroy , and call it progress . They want to standardize everything and everything that ai nt standardized they do n't know how to handle . They gave her a very bad captain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they care ? They did n't love her , all they wanted was to take their fat asses out ( with a captain to sail her ) and playlike they'us sailors ridin the bounding main . Impress a client now and then to close a deal . " He turned to stare flateyed at Grant . " He did n't take care of her at all . There was no need for her to be in that kind of shape . But I 'm sure her hull is sound . " Grant did n't say anything . What was there for him to say ? He knew next to nothing about sailing . What a crazy fuckedup world we live in ! he thought suddenly . Four men , four men from such widely separated and over-industrialized places as New York , New Jersey , Indianapolis Indiana and Milwaukee Wisconsin all converging on a tiny primitive grease spot of an island in the Caribbean Sea and why ? To escape for a few days from the fettering conditions of their highly organized , boring lives  --  in the once primitive but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing this , they would be discussing and planning ways to make money by bringing other people to it and destroying the very thing they sought there . And behind their trip , behind each pilot and hostess who would be bringing them there , there stood the ranked rows of bureaucratic workers , stewards , clerks , handling tickets in triplicate , numbered series of baggage checks to protect their luggage , weights and fuel allowances and tonnages  --  all things they all hated , but without which they would be unable even to get to their primitive island . And behind these , all the planning boards , engineering boards , air traffic control , the towermen , the radiomen  --  almost all of whom would never make the money to be able to afford such a trip t ! u ! , Iselves  --  working away their bureaucratized lives to get the four men there . And lastly , most amorphous of all because largest of all , Government . Whielt lima . of them liked either , and were all trying to escape ( hut which itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind you , for a  | time to go . Same price . I know where there 's a good wreck  --  I mean a modern one  --  I can take you to tomorrow if you want to explore it . " Grant nodded and left it at that . But the truth was he did n't feel like diving or doing anything with the thought of Lucky in his mind now . When Ali brought them deftly to dock in the messy tidewater , and they had climbed out onto the ancient wood jetty , he offered to take the diver over to the Yacht Club for a few blasts of gin . But Bonham shook his head . " No , I think I 'll stick around here . " He was already hauling in on the line to the plastic dinghy to get at the fish . Native workers on the tottery old dock came crowding around to look at the catch . " Anyway , after last night , " he said looking up from the fish with his bent-jawed incredibly sanguinary grin , " I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He had not , Grant remembered suddenly , appeared to be the least bit hungover . He had already begun gutting the fish . " I 'll have Ali to run you up the hill , " he called . " But first you got to pick your fish you want . " The Jamaican dock workers , all fiddling around with some small boat or other , had by now crowded up around him until their bare , greedylooking toes were almost touching the fish , and Bonham suddenly let loose on them that thunderous voice Grant had always suspected him of having . " GO ON ! GIT BACK AWAY FROM THERE , YOU BASTARDS , GODDAMN IT ! " he bellowed at them , gesturing with the knife . The crowd moved back a reluctant two feet , grinning . Grant , who was always overly polite to Negroes , was embarrassed but the crowd itself did n't seem to mind at all . " Here , come on , Grant ! Before these buggers rob me blind . " But when Grant chose two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bonham shook his head and began instructing him about fish . " Those two there are mangrove snapper , " he said pointing with the knife to the two already gutted fish ; " they 're the best in the batch , take them . " Beside them he laid Grant 's now gutted grouper . " But I like grouper , " Grant protested . " Okay , take this medium-sized one . Instead of one of the snapper , " he added pointedly . " But not the big ones . They 're grainy . " He proceeded to gut the grouper . While he talked to Grant , the crowd had begun to edge forward again , and one long slender adolescent boy with appreciably visible ribs had come forward far enough to have one splayed foot on either side of the end fish in the line Bonham had laid out on the pier . " GODDAMN YOU ,  | R. " Ylll1 , , I SAID GIT BACK ! " Bonham hollered , as the feet slowly came ? i ; Inc , closer together around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood pier six inches from the fish 's tail . Reluctantly the boy , his I t ill behind his back and still grinning , moved back away . Cron ' had already moved away , still embarrassed . At the car he threw ( hree fish in the back , their iridescent colors now faded and gone as if had dried up inward . As All climbed in behind the wheel , Grant looked back once and Bonwho had retrieved his knife , as if sensing the look , glanced up and rd : Inc ! waved the knife at him . rn tlley were grinding up the hill in the old station . wagon . ant the hunter was coming home with his catch . But he would rather taken a heating than go back to that goddamned unhappy miserable wrap t i f n l villa where he had to go , even with the fish . wn below on the dock , Bonham watched them thoughtfully until were out of sight .  | THE EXQUISITELY HONED KNIFE Cut into the last fish , at the vent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expertly , knowledgeably and delicately about their work as if his mind had nothing to do with it . He loved his knife and always sharpened it himself , never allowed anybody else to touch it . The knife slid up the exact center of the belly to the chin as soft and easy as if moving through water , or into a cunt , and the slippery , slightly sticky guts slithered out on the dock like prisoners released from confinement . This one had been eatin right good . Four completely whole shiner minnows could be seen through the thin belly membrane . Bonham slit the membrane and shucked them out . One of them was still alive . Laughing , Bonham showed it to the Negroes , who laughed too , and tossed it back in the water . " Lucky , " he called . " He day no come up " Automatically his fingers probed around inside the cavity making sure everything was out . Then , pulling them out clean , right up to the chin , he sliced all the guts off neatly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what his hands were doing . It was on Ron Grant . As he resharpened the knife on the big soft-Arkansas oilstone , he whistled inaudibly under his breath some idiot tune . You did n't find a good easy touch like that every day in the year . Most of them who got passionate about diving did n't have the money to do more than take a complete pool checkout and go out a couple times . And the ones who had money never got interested . In his four years in Jamaica , Grant was only the third . Sam Finer had been the second . Last year . Then , this year , Grant . Ile had been sittin in the shop with his feet up on the desk . There was some rockuroll on the radio and he listened to it picking his teeth , feeling  | the little wood instrument slide stealthily between two of his ivories near hing meat . He had sensed rather than seen the shadow fall upon the oln'n door up front , and sat up immediately and began studyin some regulator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . He really knew them by heart . Anyway regulators were n't all that much different from each other once you understood them except maybe the till ) ill which only had one adjustable part compared to the eight to sevrntrcn of the others . She was a tall broad , fairly , with her hair cut short around her ears and hack of her neck . Light behind her could n't see her face . Not a bad corpus , and she did n't have any slip on . Kind of light in the tits department . And she walked funny ; lumpish . Then he got up and she turned and he saw tier face and saw that she was old , fifty-three , fifty-five . And there was something else . He at once did n't like it . Smile  --  prissy ; and highly selfconscious . Pinched in at the corners to make two sort of self-righteous ' owls . Was there a make there ? Maybe ; it was too soon to tell . But she was old enough he did n't really care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , too ; self-adoring . " I certainly do , Mam . " He let his face open up in a grin . " Especially to pretty ladies , Mam . That 's my specialty . " He especially made it flattery , and not any kind of a make . And a remarkable change occurred in her . The corners relaxed so the smile opened out into a real one , and her dark eyes opened more and got drrp and friendly , had real warmth . That way she was n't really bad looking , for an old one . " 011 , it 's not for me ! " she said in some confusion . " It 's for a friend of plnc . My foster-son , really . Who is coming down . Today . He wants ? " She reached in her purse as if she knew just where it was and pulled out and held up a wire as if she needed it for confirmation . " ? he wants to I ' un skindiving . " " ' Then you 've come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting heartiht ' % ' in his voice . ' I'hcn a remarkable thing happened . For no reason that he could see the 1uwls clamped down again and the eyes got small and undeep again and thc , iety , or whatever it was , came back on her . Curiously , it even shim ci in the position of her back , which seemed to slightly bow itself soddenly . It was then that he knew she was crazy . Or awful close to ft . " A'c 're staying with the Countess de Blystein , " she said ; very prissy . " I know the Countess , " Bonham said promptly . " Not well , of course . "  | He did . He had met her . Everybody in the town knew Evelyn de Blystein a little . " Well , we are staying with she and the Count Paul . My husband , myself , and our foster-son . His name is Ron Grant . I expect you 've heard of him perhaps ? " " I think so , " Bonham said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a Broadway playwright . You must have heard of The Song of Israphael . It ran three and a half years on Broadway . " " I think so , " Bonham said . " Yes . " " It was a very famous film . MGM brought it out . It won five Academy Awards . " " Yes . I saw the film , " Bonham said . Then he did remember it . He had seen it . About Pearl Harbor . About a sailor and a whore . He 'd been in the Navy himself in the war , and he 'd liked it . There was no bullshit in it . Or not much . But she was beginning to piss him off . Who cared ? He smiled at her . " I remember it very well . I liked it . " " He 's quite famous , you know . " She did n't come out and say he was very lucky to have such a client , but it was implied . " Yes , he certainly is , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mam ? " " My name is Carol Abernathy . And my husband 's name is Hunt Abernathy . " " I see . Your husband 's here ? " " Yes . " She smiled that smile . " I think I told you that . " Bonham ignored that . " And will both of you be comin along , too ? " " No , no . My husband wo n't . He 's not interested . He 's a golfer . But I thought I might come along the first day to see . " " You should try it yourself , Mam . You 'll find it 's very exciting , " he had said , " and , I think , intellectually stimulating . The undersea life here in Jamaica is one of the richest in flora and fauna in the entire world . " The smile and the eyes had turned shy now . Vulnerable . " Well , I 'm not sure I could do it . I 'm an excellent swimmer , though . " " Anybody can do it . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I start people off in a swimming pool , " Bonham said gently , " for the first few days . Until I 've taught them how to use the aqualung . It 's much safer that way . And my way is to teach safely . Actually , I taught my own mother to skindive , and she is almost eighty . She loves it now . " He kept his face completely open . The woman was smiling ingenuously now , and the eyes and mouth cor-  | Hers were a bit more open . " Well , perhaps I will . Give it a try , I mean . i nn uorrow , then ? " " Be glad to have you , Mam . " " What time , please ? " " After lunch ? Two ? Two-thirty ? Three ? " " I ) o n't you have to let your food digest for four hours ? Before ? " " Not in a pool , Mam . " " Very well , at three then . Tomorrow . " She offered him the tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then suddenly she turned back . And her face astounded Bonham this time . It still had the jowly , p in hed-corners , priss look , but now the eyes had become like those of Nnne 0 very knowledgeable jungle cat . " There 's just one other thing . " " Main ? " " Henn  --  Mister Grant  --  plans on going on to Kingston to actually learn his diving , I believe . From a man named Georges Villalonga ? " She prone untied it French . " I know George , " Bonham said . He pronounced it American . " But I du n't think he 's in Kingston any more . I think he went out to the West ( : 4-utit to work for US Di " " 1t'hether he 's still there or not , I would like very much for Mister Grant M do all his diving here , in Ganado Bay . " The voice still had its tight priss nan ( l , but now there was a very sharp edge to it , too . A very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Kingston at all . " She paused . " Do you follow inc ? " Bonham had stared expressionlessly into those eyes for quite a long moment . " I think so , Mam . You mean you 'd like him to do all his learning and diving here with me because you trust my ability . Well , I 'll certainly try to bell ) all f can . " Then he made himself grin . " Naturally , I would n't like to u good , high-payin customer to Kingston . " She did n't smile . " Good . We understand each other . Goodby . " And she turn ( - ( I and stumped  --  lumpished  --  herself , in that peculiar prissy bentbacked walk , out the door . ' Mrs. Abernathy ! " She turned back in the doorway . " W oolc ! you mind telling me who sent you to me ? " " Why , yes , " she smiled . " The manager of the Royal Canadian Bank . " Mir turned and left . By now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what Way , or why , he did n't know enough to know . Things a guy had to do to make a living . That kind in divin you had to watch very carefully . Be  | prone to panic . He hoped she did n't go . But maybe the guy  --  the boyfriend ? ? would n't want to go either if she did n't want to go . Some were like that . Damned women . Well , if he watched her close . He hated to lose two customers right now . Or even one . Letta 's salary was hardly keepin them goin this month . And this was February . Well , he had a pool checkout at the Royal Carib this afternoon . One unwealthy tourist . Probly , he thought as he had gone about getting the gear ready at the back of the shop , this Grant would turn out to be some kind of half-fag highfalutin snob type . If his gir  --  if his foster-mother was any good example . Well there was no accountin for tastes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But why did n't she want him to go to Kingston ? If they did n't get so terrible bad he could n't stomach it , he could do it . For the money . That kind , the richies , always wanted the top luxury treatment and anything else made them turn up their noses . He would give it to them , if he had it . If he ever got it , ever got a chance to get it . Deliciously  --  but with a grinding jealousy of acquisitiveness  --  he let himself dwell as he worked on the Naiad and his trip down to Kingston to look her over . There was hope there . If he could ever get her . You met all kinds of kooks in this business . That dame , for instance . He was pretty damn sure this Grant would turn out to be a highbrow prick . The weight of it on his broad back had made the tanks heavier as he carried them out to his old station wagon to go the Carib . That and the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the money . And just think , someday they would all be dead . The sudden thought opened up a hollow in Bonham , of amazement , disbelief , fear and depression . What he 'd like to do this afternoon was go out and kill himself a shark . Whenever he got to thinking of his own eventual , inevitable death , and sometimes it lasted for days , the only thing that could snap him out of it was to get Ali and the boat and go out to his " 01 ' Shark Hole " where there was almost always one or two hangin around and diving down deep and viciously with his fury and his fear spear himself one of those evil foulsmelling bastards with a killing head shot , a six or seven-footer Blue or Tiger or shovelnose . Even if he did n't make a killing brain shot and had to cut the line , he 'd get himself a hell of a ride out of it . And they were n't goin to do anybody much good after that with a spear through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their bruthc'rs would take care of them down the line ! Suddenly he wanted very badly to go . Ile did n't take any buddies or his  | Grant , on the other hand , was good . He was completely brave , although for some reason he did n't seem to know it . He caught on fast , and he caught up with and even surpassed the insurance man , who was on his third day , by the end of the lesson . The second day he took them to the West Moon Over Hotel , because he had to take the insurance man , who was leaving in two days , out for his first dive on the shallow reef in the morning . The West Moon Over was the ritziest and most expensive hotel in Ganado Bay , and for this reason Bonham did n't usually take people there for lessons unless they were registered there . But he figured a little publicity could n't do any harm . So he stopped by in the morning and told the manager who he was bringing in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave Grant the lesson and quite suddenly , after he was all through with what he had to do with mask and lung and looking relieved , Grant began to do springboard diving . They had a regulation three-meter board at the West Moon Over ( the only one in town except for the Country Club ) and Grant just up and climbed it ? and on his first dive did a beautiful , absolutely letter-perfect pike forward one and a half . Then he seemed to get caught up in the emotional spirit of it , Bonham sensed ( perhaps because the pool was deserted ) , and began to do all manner of things : a beautiful layout full gainer to which he added both half twist and full twist ; back one and a halfs tucked ; flying mares , which was a layout swan held halfway down and finished off with with a tucked front one ; and then he finished it all off with two fulltwisting forward one and a halfs . Bonham thought he had never seen anything so beautiful , absolutely beautiful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she did n't seem to think anything very much of the springboard diving , or of any sports , Bonham decided  --  any sports which she could not do herself , he guessed . Luckily she did n't come any more after that second day , and they men could be alone together . Bonham had been around pools and swimming all his life , and had actually swum backstroke for both his high school in Jersey and for the U. of Pa . He knew what that kind of near-letter-perfect three meter board diving entailed . The high degree of nervous and muscle coordination to start with , and then the work . The literally hours and hours and hours of constant practice , over and over and over , the hard falls and faulted dives that landed you flat on the water on your back or on your face . It was then that he began really to admire Grant for the first time . IIe did them absolutely beautiful , and he was beautiful doing them . Never mind the intellectual , playwright horseshit.  | sailing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Grant would make a better partner , and a better friend , than either Sam Finer or Orloffski . Bonham had his reservations , which he had not told Grant , about both of them . Especially Orloffski . Orloffski was a crude , cocky , loudmouth , stupid insensitive brute . Smaller than Bonham , he was nevertheless strong as hell and built like a pro football player , and he was a more than adequate spearfisherman and diver . But he was a lousy sailor . Bonham had been out with him on the cutter up in Jersey , and while Bonham knew quite well that he himself could handle the schooner all alone , he had watched Orloffski sail and knew equally well that Orloffski could never handle the schooner by himself , though Orloffski loudly claimed he could . In addition , Orloffski was a pretty big drunk . Though they were all somewhat of that . But Orloffski was bad . And Bonham also suspected that he was some kind of a psychologically compulsive thief . That was a lot against . Still , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable that the deal could not be swung without him . Sam Finer on the other hand was very smart . And tough . He had come up along some very hard tough route , and his grammar was as bad as Orloffski 's , but he was a smart businessman . " Bars will always make money , Al , " was one of his theories , " because people will always drink . " He knew nothing at all about sailing and admitted it . He was willing to serve as lowliest crew . And diving and spearfishing he adored . And he had the hard cash . But he was a very bad drunk . Worse than Orloffski . Because when he got drunk , he wanted to fight . Most of the time . And he was a mean fighter . Bonham had already bailed him out of three or four scrapes that might have gotten him killed , or at the least sent to jail . His wife would be coming down with him this time for the first time ( they had only been married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Sam had met her in New York on a business trip , Bonham thought he remembered . Was n't she a model ? Well , we will see . We will see . This first general meeting was going to be very important he knew . Very important . He could feel his hands begin to sweat . 0 , that ship ! 0 , that ship ! If he could only get his hands on her ! Get her , and sail her , and pay her off . So he  --  so the corporation ( but of which he would be both President and Captain ) ? would own her ! He could take her anywhere in the world . He could sail her to Cape Verde and the Canaries and take her in the Mediterranean , if anybody wanted to go there . And from there he could take her right on around the whole darnn God-  | date world , if they wanted to go ! A free man , in a free ship , and nobody to tell him one damn thing this or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could hardly wait , and at the same Nmc he hoped next week never came . I t was good that damn woman , that Mrs. Abernathy , would n't be around either . Over there maybe he could talk some to Grant without her Influence bein around all the time to offset him every night at home .  | ON HIS THIRD TIME OUT with Bonham Grant speared his first sting ray . And quite erroneously at least for a while  --  he decided he had reached a plateau of some kind . They had gone out , this third trip , to inspect the wreck Bonham had told him about the day before . It lay just off the western end of the harbor mouth in about fifty feet of water . Apparently it had happened during the war Bonham said , when this freighter , a sort of modified Liberty ship carrying American war supplies for somewhere , had tried too late to get out of Ganado Bay Harbor ahead of one of the rare hurricanes that hit Jamaica . It had sprung a leak due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been washed onto a reef there by the winds , where it broke up and sank . US Navy divers had salvaged what was salvageable in her , and the rest was still there broken into huge chunks scattered across the quiet sand . They had not meant to fish particularly but had taken the spearguns with them anyway since as Bonham said you never knew when you might see something either good to eat or exciting to try . That was exactly how it turned out . The smashed and broken ship , parts of it lying as far as sixty and a hundred yards apart , filled Grant with a nervous awe for what the sea could do , for what power it could have when really agitated , as he lay on the surface in the lung looking down at it . Impulsively and a little fearfully , he raised his head and looked up into the world of air : the sun was shining brightly , glints of it sparkled cheerfully off the water , the wash rolled him gently and almost lovingly , the air was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planed straight down not bothering with the anclun line in his new-found familiarity with the lung . On the quiet sand  | holding banderillas . Just above the ugly little creature he braked , leveled , then dipped down with incredible delicacy and stabbed the knife squarely into the head just behind the eyes , wrenched it free and drew back . The little fish , fairly struck , flapped and bucked and lashed about with its poisonous barbed tail ineffectually . In three seconds it was dead , and turned belly upward floated gently down toward the sand . Above it , motionless , his body in an odd indefinable posture which communicated intense satisfaction , Bonham watched its death throes , then sheathing his knife came swimming back to Grant . He paid no more attention to the quarry . He could not grin in the aqualung , but he smiled with his eyes and wiggled his eyebrows with an innocent , totally unselfconsious pleasure in the killing which Grant suddenly realized he himself would never be able to achieve during the runout of his life no matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his envy , growing . Casually the big man took the speargun and motioned that Grant should try the camera out and take some shots of him on the wreck . It was only two or three minutes after that that they saw the big ray , and Bonham galvanized into action again . Where it had come from Grant could n't tell . Not that it mattered . Apparently it had been in among the reef hillocks behind them where the big ship had ground itself to pieces and which rose to within ten feet of the surface , feeding or playing games , and was now off across the rippled sand toward deep water on some private mission of its own . He had no time to think more than this when Bonham from thirty yards away was suddenly beside him wresting the camera from him and thrusting the speargun into his hands . Agitatedly he motioned for Grant to go and get it . As Grant started off , he repeatedly stabbed his forefinger into his mask squarely between his own eyes while with his other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant nodded vigorously . Between the eyes and two inches behind for a brain shot , sure , he knew all that , he 'd read all that . Following Bonham 's method , he swam slightly upward to get above the fish . Two of the gun 's rubbers were cocked , he noticed , but only vaguely . Because by then something had come over him and he was excited in a way he had not been excited since the war , and then only a very few tunes . It went from his chest straight down into his balls and sent tingle after tingle of electricity through them . His scrotum contracted . He remembered a bicycle race he had won at the County Fair when he was in high school , when he had n't cared what happened to him or if he died . It was like that now . Ile was going to chase this fish , catch it , kill it , destroy it , and lw did n't care what happened to him .  | Four to four and a half feet across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From above , as he started his dive , right arm and gun extended before him , kicking softly , like Bonham , he could see the long poison spine a third of the way back along the undulating tail , with its bonewhite recurved teeth from which the skin sheath  --  integument , the books called it  --  was missing because of use and wear . This one was an old toughy . Okay ; good ! The spearhead hit him squarely between the eyes , went on through , and smacked into the sand . Swimming back away , Grant pulled until the hinged , spoonlike , unsharp barbs held him snugly . It was n't a killing shot . Damn ! Damn ! Down below , the ray was kicking up a cloud of sand against the bottom . Grant swam him up a little . At the other end of the fourteen feet of spear and line the rising ray whirled and gyrated . Grant waited , fascinated . Spontaneously , he drew his knife . But the fish made no effort to attack him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the dinghy was like trying to run with a kite against a heavy wind . What do we do now ? How 'll we boat him ? What about sharks ? He looked around for Bonham . Here I am , Bonham , attached to this goddam thing ! The big diver , who had been taking pictures of Grant as he swam down and shot , took one more picture of him holding the wildly gyrating ray and then swam over and calmly motioned him over toward the top of the reef . Inside his mask Grant could see that he was laughing . The reef was a hundred yards away and by the time Grant got there , puffing and blowing from hauling his underwater kite , the ray had worn himself down a lot . When he whipped at all it was feebly . On the very top of the reef ten feet below the surface Bonham motioned what he wanted him to do . Following the silent instructions , Grant stuck the spearhead firmly into some soft coral and holding pressure on the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headdown at an angle , plenty high enough so the spine on the whipping tail could not touch him . Swimn , ing around to the front Bonham put his left hand forward cautiously and grasped the wing just beside the head . His hand appeared to stick there when he did . Then with his knife held the same way as before he stabbed for a spot two , two-and-a-half inches behind the eyes . The first try missed and hit an eye of the still moving fish . The second connected . The ray 1 n ivered . Taking the butt end of the spear , Bonham swam him over to the dinghy and boated him at arm 's length with a long swing up of the spear , not unlike a farmer forking hay onto a wagon . It required a considerable amount of strength to do it , and the dinghy sank visibly under the weight . Grant felt his hero-worship growing even greater . But the next development surprised him . Bonham calmly proceeded to  | give him a lesson on how to take the lung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouthpiece . No sharks had appeared , Grant noted , nor did Bonham seem worried about them . When he took the tanks off over his head underwater as instructed , he sank six or eight feet but with the mouthpiece still in his mouth he was able to breathe easily and swam right back up where , grasping the ladder , he reversed the bottles and handed them up to All by the yoke . In the boat after he clambered in and slumped back against the gunnel Bonham began to roar with laughter as he reached for the gin bottle . Ali , after helping them in , had gone back to staring at the dinghy . " My God ! " he said . " You guys crazy ! " " Here ! " Bonham said , still roaring and holding out the bottle . " Slug it ! You earned it ! " " What are you laughing at me for ? " Grant said , thinlipped . He was furious . He would not touch the bottle . " I 'm not laughin at you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm laughin for you . You 're gon na be all right , boy ! You 're gon na do just fine ! " Grant resented the ' boy ' . " You think so ? " he said thinly . " I know so ! I 'll bet money on it ! Cash money ! " Again he laughed , roaring . " You were all ready to go for him with that knife if he came at you , were n't you ? " He waggled the bottle . Reluctantly Grant took it . " I did n't know what else to do . " " You could of cut the line , " Bonham said . " Why did n't you cut the line ? " " It never occurred to me , " Grant said wonderingly . " Anyway , cutting the line would n't have done any good if he was going to come for me . " " That 's right ! But most people would 've cut it . In a panic . Rays never go after people after they 're hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moray eels . They will . " He had about stopped laughing , but he snorted again shaking his great head , before accepting the bottle back from Grant . Grant , somewhat mollified now , mollified in fact to the point of shy embarrassment by Bonham 's openness about his courage , had drunk deep from the gin bottle , and the straight gin warmed and burned in his belly pleasantly , heating up and dissolving the knot of cold fear that came when he contemplated what could have happened . He felt happy inside , down t here in his belly where the gin was , but he was curiously depressed too . It was then that he knew he had reached no plateau ' after all . " I le would have died anyway , would n't he ? " he asked . " If I had cut the line ? I mean , soon enough that we could have got him ? " " I duuno . I'robly , " Bonham said , inhaling deeply after a generous help-  | ing of gin . Again he snorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny , you two , out there horsing each other around on the opposite ends of that speargun . " " I was n't at all sure I could hold him , " Grant said . " But he pooped out pretty fast . " " Most fish do . They ai nt really built for longterm endurance . And they panic . " " What do you think he 'll weigh ? " " I do n't know . Eighty-five ? A hundred ? Maybe more . " He turned his head , without moving his big arms stretched along the gunnel . " Ali , get that damn thing up here and let 's see what he looks like . " " You know how I hate those damn things , boss , " Ali said in his East Indian accent . " Those damn devilfish . " " He 's dead . I promise you . And he 's no devilfish . If he was , we would n't get him in this boat , I guarantee you . Every ray 's a Manta to these guys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddam it ! " he commanded , " git him up here ! " " I could n't even lift him , boss , " Ali said . " GO ON ! Get him up . I 'll help you . " Gingerly and reluctantly Ali drew in the painter till the dinghy was alongside , and got a long-handled gaffhook into the head . It was completely true that , at least in that awkward position with no purchase for leverage , he could n't lift it . But with Bonham helping with another gaff they managed to slither the slimy beast over the side into the cockpit . " He 'll go more than a hundred , " Bonham said breathing heavily . He stood looking down at the animal ( Grant could n't think of it as a fish ' ) whose spreadout wings nearly touched both sides of the cockpit . " Evil bastards ! " he said finally . Working carefully , he first cut out and laid aside the stinger . It measured five and a half inches . " Make you a good trophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivory . Make you a good toothpick ! " he said , and roared . " Sure , " Grant said . But when he bent to inspect it , Bonham called out , " Careful ! That spongy tissue on both sides in them grooves is what generates the poison . It could still hurt you . " He bent back over the big fish . " Here , I 'll show you something else . " He tapped one of the wings with the flat of the knife . " You see this here ? One of the best eatin fish there is , these wings . I 'll cut them out for you when we get back in and you take them home with you tonight and do n't tell them what it is , and they 'll swear to you it 's the best red snapper they ever ate . I 'll bet you a hundred dollars on it . " Okay , come on , Ali . Let 's get him back in the dinghy . Wait a minute !  | " You want me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , but he was embarrassed , and also his depression was still there , had come back . His depression had been growing steadily . " No . No , I guess not . You got one of me with him underwater , did n't you ? " " Yeah , but it may not show his size . " Grant shook his head . " I guess not , " he said , and as they got the gaffhooks into the beast again , he moved forward to the wheel dashboard to get out of their way . And when Bonham came back to start the engine and run them back in while Ali began washing down the slimy cockpit in the sun , he moved over and stood alone , looking out the half-open starboard windshield . Why was he depressed ? This was what he had come down here specifically to do . And already , on his third day of it , he had had a sort of minor triumph , spearing a hundred-pound sting ray . Nobody could say that was n't at least somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't done it all alone ? Certainly he would n't have done it if Bonham had n't pushed him probably ; and he might never have boated it if Bonham with his experience had n't been there to help . Though he might have alone , because it was pretty obviously dying by the time they got over to the reef . There was still in him a great excitement of triumph over having speared and battled the ray like he had , and over having felt his blood get up the way it had  --  to where he did n't really care , about anything , anything but the kill . He was sort of proud of that . Bonham had even thought him brave . Why could n't he feel happy about it then ? The excitement over the ray remained , although it was a dense , uncomfortable , not at all pleasant excitement . And yet , underneath that , there was a deflated feeling of : If this was reality , so what ? ' He had come down here seeking a reality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? Who knew ? A relief from a feeling that life was too soft . Anyway a reality he felt was missing from his life , and from his work , and for a long time . A reality Carol Abernathy was at least partially responsible for the loss of , with her peculiar and increasingly domineering ways and coddling . He had speared a big fish , and they had killed it , and what remained ? What remained was to have your picture taken with it like a tourist ( which was why he refused ) . What remained was to run it in to the dock and hang it on a block where the awestruck dockworkers  --  and maybe even a few whites  --  could admire you while you bragged . Like All . That was what remained . And yet he wanted to brag about it . This was reality ? !  | All , on the other hand , had his own reality . He thought they were both tvy . And who was to say he was n't right ? Then there was Bonham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as simple as that . And thought no more about it . Grant 's hero-wortlp hor the big diver went up another notch . His love for Bonham had born increasing ponderously in three days ' diving , Bonham 's careful care i ( his accurate and thoughtful teaching , his so obviously serious menforhoml , who would n't fall in love with all of that ? It was said in the rich international set in Switzerland , where Grant had Visited a couple of times , that everybody falls in love with his ski instrucIDr , or , in Manhattan , with his analyst . lint the real truth was  --  the Grant reality was  --  he was still the same d ( : rant . After all of this . That was the real truth . Nothing had changed . r had taken a big , fairly dangerous fish , but nothing had changed . Beuse he had n't liked it . He had done it , but he had n't liked it . He had hated rn t ornent of it , actually , and would hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his mind . He much would have preferred be in that tiny Park Avenue apartment fingering that lush body beside it ; oil snugly watching the cold winter sunshine outside the window , sod Ile almost hated her for that . The only thing that had really changed W that next time he would know better how to handle a big ray  --  and ptuv lie Ile would shoot better ! He could see it down the future , fifty rays , a htnndred rays , until he became bored with knowing and shooting rays . And lie would still be the same scared Grant . Well , if he did more and more dangerous things , sharks maybe , maybe Own It would be better . Sharks . Did sharks worry about whether they were brave or not ? They did not . They were in fact about the most cowardly creatures on God 's earth . Only when they had a wounded sitting duck to feed on , were they 641 , . Only then and when they had their blood up ? ' mob feeding patMrn ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it war ' ? ? in which in their hell/ they would eat a wounded brother , a life preserver , a stick of wood . That was reality . I IIs arms folded tautly across his chest , his jaw muscles tight , he stared out at the still dim but swiftly approaching shoreline , and a hot fury rose till iii him , so furious and full of frustrated hate and loss , that he wanted to Ilan to Bonham and ask him to go back out right now and look for something else to hunt , something good this time , maybe sharks , something wall good . I le looked over . Beside him at the wheel Bonham was whisIltnig I apl , ilV. " ti , th , ! " lie grinned , and leaned over the wheel to pick up from the  | dashboard the sharp-pointed sawtooth spine carefully by its butt . He held it up , and suddenly he seemed to take on the stance and look of a professional high school studyhall lecturer ( which he has probably done some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chamber of Commerce and business goodwill ) . Grinning , he intoned : " This serrated barb with its own builtin poison-creating tissue attached has not changed , evolved or regressed in over sixty-eight million years . Imagine that ? Can you imagine that ? The venom it creates affects the vascular system and causes swelling and violent cramps and , if the victim 's abdomen has been punctured , may even cause death . This is the kind of wound it makes , " he grinned , and propped his foot up on the helmsman 's chair behind him to expose a corded scar two inches long on the inside of his right heel . " No dramatic attack and defense . No terrifying underwater battle . Simply stepped on him in the sand bottom of a lagoon in waist-deep water , and was laid up for three weeks . " He tossed the spine back onto the dashboard amongst the disarray of tools and heavy leather gloves and took his foot down . " Now he tells me ! " Grant said with a bitter grin , made tougher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thanks . Thanks a lot . " Curiously , the tough reaction made him feel some better , though deep down the depression stayed . " Not at all . You 're welcome , " Bonham grinned . He picked the stinger up again . " Primitive man throughout the world has been using these spines for needles and spear tips since before the dawn of history . " He turned it back and forth between his thumb and finger for a moment . " End of lecture , " he said and tossed it back . " Yes sir , we 're gon na work out all right together ! Really all right ! " It was , or so Grant felt , a considered compliment . " What about sharks ? " he asked , to cover his pleasure . " Do n't you ever worry about them ? Do n't you ever keep an eye out for them ? " " Keep an eye out for them all a time . " " I mean , I thought once something was wounded and there was blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonham said expansively and rubbed his stomach , " you got to know your waters , and your terrain . Tide 's important . With that ray now it was incoming tide and I was watchin all the time , but there 's almost never any sharks around that area . I do n't know why . " If you want to go someplace where you 'll see sharks , now , I know a couple places . One of them , you 'll see all the sharks you 'll ever want to see . " Grant felt a small drill of excitement , an unwished-for and curiously  | err pleasant excitement , bore itself into his lower abdomen . He did n't answer . " Yes sir ! We 're gon na get along really all right together ! " Bonham said happily , and began his happy whistling again . It was curiously odd , Grant realized suddenly , and another indication of that peculiar , almost-feminine sensitivity Bonham could evince for so seemingly extrovert a man , that he had strictly and without talking left It completely alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could he bue known it was depression ? Almost certainly not . He thought it was a ? nsant savoring of the experience . lint if Bonham was happy over the bag and over the total results of the clue 's dive , he was taken aback and thrown off his stride when Grant told him that Carol Abernathy wanted to go along with them to Grand Bank staid . lionham 's face got long , and his eyes flat . " Well , Christ ! " he rumbled . hat 'll she do ? I mean , there is n't much there , you know . There 's just this one real hotel , and the town . A real drunken port town . Two fleabag hotels , and ten bars in it . I would n't even stay in the town myself . And all well be doin is divin . " He was trying hard to cover up his displeasure . She do n't dive . What 'll she do with herself ? " ( : rant was staring off through the starboard windshield . " Says she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She swims very well you know . Better than nue . And then there 'll be the other women , wo n't there ? " Bonham seemed to sense the implacability , though of course without knowing why . " Sure . But Orloffski 's wife  --  his girlfriend  --  is a pig , " he said unerluivocally . " So is Orloffski for that matter . And she drinks like a fish . NIrs Abernathy does n't drink , does she ? " he said politely . " No , " Grant said . " And I 've never met Sam Finer 's wife . I do n't have no idea what she 's like . " IIe shifted his stance behind the wheel . " I 'm not tryin to be a wet blanket , you understand . But there wo n't be much to do but dive . Dive , drink , and eat fish . " And this is n't just only a diving trip , you know . It could be a very important business thing for me too . " " I understand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come , " he said . " Then it 's okay by me , " Bonham rumbled . Grant nodded and gave him a smile , though he could feel that his own eyes were flat too . " Thanks . " Then he shrugged . He wanted to take away some of the sting of forcing him . " She says she 'd like to see the place . Who knows ? I do n't know why . "  | " I said it 's okay by me . It wo n't make that much difference , I guess . " He occupied himself with the steering . Grant nodded again . He had n't told him all of it of course . He could n't . Not without telling him a lot of other things . He wished , suddenly , that he could tell him all of it . All fourteen years of it . Bonham would be a good confidant , he thought . It was the first time he had ever really wanted to tell anybody , he realized . It had been a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible night now . He was finally convinced that she was really crazy . But it was only part of the time . Just the same this of course stimulated all sorts of frenzied , frantic guilts . Or was she just pulling that , to create exactly that effect ? How did you know ? God , the guilts ! Everything went back such a long way . When was responsibility fulfilled ? Ever ? They had really helped him so much . She had helped him so much . Even artistically , back at the beginning . Though that ended six or seven years ago . Even before the financial help became unnecessary . How much of the rest of your life did you have to give up for that ? All of it ? Before dinner  --  at cocktails  --  it had started . It was n't what Carol said , because Carol said almost nothing , but the air was so stiff it was like everybody was breathing overbeaten meringue . Evelyn of course could carry anything off , an atom bomb in the yard would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frankly , intrigued by what was going on . At dinner she was positively twittery over the fish  --  twittery in a social , keep-the-evening-going way that let you know cynically that none of this reached her soul ; or , " meant a goddam fucking thing , " as she would say , " who 're you ? " It was posititvely the best fish she had tasted in Jamaica , Grant 's snapper . And her people got her hers right off the dock , not at any goddamned Market . Of course by the time the French chef , imported by herself and Paul from Paris , got through with it you would n't have known it was fish , though it was delicious . Fish , fish , had to be cooked in cornmeal in a crusty black skillet on a swaying boat by a dirty Cherokee squaw and eaten crowded in with fishermen , Grant who had once worked on a fishing boat in the Keys at Marathon believed . He remembered suddenly the weeks , months , when Carol had come and visited  --  visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! cooking , cleaning , marketing ? when he was rewriting , rewriting hopelessly , the first big three-acter , The Song of Israphael . Jesus ! And after dinner it was no better . Evelyn had asked some people iu for  | poker , the almost-young couple who half owned and wholly managed the exclusive West Moon Hotel , and a couple of **25;263;TOOLONG Britislc friends who had driven over from Montego Bay for the night , expressly for the poker . They were all tough players . And Grant loved to play with them . But that night he could n't . He was half drunk but the air was still too stiff . Hunt , three quarters drunk , had determinedly stayed downstairs and played though he was n't a good player . Evelyn was an excellent player , when she had the cards , but when she did n't have them she could n't throw in and stop betting hoping to draw out , and could lose a handle . Still , she could afford it . Everyone waited for those nights , even the rich friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excused himself and gone upstairs . Carol followed him . " Do n't you think that 's a little unwise ? " he asked as she came into his room . He had made himself a hefty drink and rolled up with Sir Algernon Asl , inall 's Pocket Guide to the West Indies . " Probably , " she said . " I do n't care . That Evelyn knows everything about crybody in the whole world . " Then suddenly her voice broke tragically . " What do I care about anything any more ? " Grant read . " Come on down to our room , " Carol said . " I want to talk to you . Sericacsly . " She swept out . I le had put the book away and followed . She was being a woman tonight . Instead of the teacher-mentor-Master , who worried about careers . I fell bath no fury like a blah , blab , blah . He felt he knew every routine so well now . Still , this act was better than the other . Then his callousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about the proposed Grand Bank trip the night before , after Bonham first broached it to him . He had not even said that he was going , only that he might , and she had said practically nothing about it ; dl and had shown little interest . So when she suddenly , in Hunt 's and her room , said that she would like to go along with him , he was surprised into asking , " Why ? " It was exactly the wrong answer . " Well , " she said , smiling softly , and tears welled up behind her eyes , its probably the last trip you and I will ever make together anywhere . And I would kind of like to have it . Sort of a nice way , you know , of saying goodby . " Grant had exploded . " Oh , Christ ! " Such an unfair way to take advantage . " A woman knows when she 's no longer wanted , " Carol said hollowly . Resigned sorrow had claimed her .  | " So does a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , being what she is  --  more intuitive , more dependent , more forced to take the second place  --  knows it sooner than a man , I think . " This kind of thing could always drive him into a frenzy . " Look , goddamn it ! You 've always said yourself someday I 'd have to get married . I 've heard you say it ! I 've heard you tell your friends  --  tell Evelyn  --  back home that someday you 'd have to pick out a good wife for me ! Jesus ! " Aware how ridiculous what he was saying was , he still could n't stop it . " Well , how about letting me pick out my own goddamned wife ? What 's wrong with that ? Even a thirty-six-year-old boy like me ought to have that right ! Jesus ! " he said again and clutched his hair . How could he get mousetrapped into these things ? " But I never meant it , " Carol said . " That was just glib talk . I never thought it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does one ? " " Aw , come on ! Come off it ! Are you kidding ? " Grant hollered , waving his arms . " When I 'm fifty , you 'll be nearly seventy . You took your chances ! " " I know , " Carol said . " I 'm asking you humbly , please take me with you on this trip . Please let me go . A parting gift . A farewell trip together . For a nice memory . " All right , " Grant said thinly . " But on those conditions . ? As long as it 's all right with Bonham . " " It 'll be all right with Bonham , " Carol said with a sharp smile . " As long as you 're paying his plane fare and his expenses . " Once again she had startled him . He had never ceased to be amazed by her . " What about Hunt ? " " Hunt understands me very well . Better than you do , " Carol said sadly . " I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to get out of this . " Okay . As long as it 's okay with Bonham . And on those conditions . Your own conditions . " Carol Abernathy nodded . But he already knew somehow that she did n't really mean it , or mean to stand by it , or even believe it . Jesus ! " Thank you , Ron , " she said abjectly , and then she sighed . " When is your new girl coming down ? " " That 's none of your business , " he said , furious again . " I do n't know yet . Not till after this Grand Bank Island trip anyway . " " And you 'll take her on to Kingston with you ? " " That 's my intention . Yes , " he said cruelly . " Why not ? " But he still did n't really mean to . " I hope you 'll both have a very good time , " Carol said . " Just promise me  | one thing . That you wo n't marry her until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all these years of helping you with your work and your c arcer. " " 0 , Jesus ! " Grant cried , clutching his fists in his hair again . Such abject %elf-abasement , even when this patently false , destroyed him . There was a big Empire desk in the room , which Evelyn had had moved in so Carol Abernathy could do her work ' and correspondence ' with the Little Theatre Group , though they all knew tacitly ( except possibly Carol ) that it was pretty much of a joke , and in front of it stood a huge heavy modern metal executive 's swiveling office chair . Grant , standing by it and looking around like a child who has been tricked by adult illogic and cunning into giving up his most cherished flaws , to find something to vent his frustration on , reached out his foot and kicked it with all his strength , banging his toe painfully in the soft , ropesoled shoe . On the bare tiled floor the chair shot across the room on its rollers to where Carol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ankle . The reaction from her was immediate and startling . Yelling " Ow ! " automatically , she leaped to her feet , put her foot on the stool to rub the ankle , and eyes blazing almost slightlessly hollered , " You struck a woman ! You hit a female ! You struck a female ! " " I did n't ! " Grant protested . He felt like wringing his hands . " I did n't ! I kicked the chair ! The chair hit your ankle ! But I did n't mean for it to ! " During this idiot speech he had become almost pleading . " You hit a lady ! " Carol yelled right on nevertheless , her dark eyes blazing , sightlessly and insanely . " I always knew you were a mean , evil , degenerate brute ! " And at this moment Evelyn de Blystein came upon them . There was a discreet  --  but not so discreet as to be unheard and unnoticed  --  knock on tile door . May I come in ? " " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down . The door had already opened . " What the hell are you two doing , for God 's sake ? " Evelyn said in her deep whiskey voice . She had a seamed , tough , cynical businesswoman 's face with knowing hooded lids . They made her look wryly sated as if she had seen everything and been amused by it all . And she loved that role . But if this attitude was also her act , there was enough truth behind to give her a certain style . " All that racket ! Having a fight ? Good ! Tell me ! " I crone to see how you were , dear , " she said pointedly , looking Carol st , aight in the eye . " We were arguing over this man Al Bonham , " Carol said , her face still  | angry . " This idiot here has fallen in love with him , and I 'm trying to tell him he better watch out for them . They 're going to try to take him , I 'm positive ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this consummate , absolute lie like a running broadjumper without looking back , utilizing her anger from before as if it were some kind of tool . And it appeared to be enough to convince Evelyn , the cynical Evelyn . " Well , I do n't know him very well , " she said with a gravelly wryness . " But I can look him up . I do n't see how he can take you for much , anyway , though . Some diving equipment . Some trips . Surely you can afford that . " " How about a share in a schooner ? " Carol said . " Ah ! " Evelyn smiled . " That 's different ! I would certainly look at the schooner first . And at the corporate structure . " " That 's what I 've been telling him , " Carol said , nodding . Grant was still flabbergasted into speechless fury . " I 'm not in love with him , " he was finally able to say . He could feel how sullen his face was , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is a superb diver , and I trust him . At least in diving . " " I 've heard that , " Evelyn said . " I know he 's pretty well liked by the local businessmen and their goddam fucking Chamber of Commerce . " Quite suddenly , she yawned . " Darling , do come back down , " she then said to Carol . " Do you feel better now ? I want you to tell the Rawsons about your Little Theatre Group in Indianapolis . " " Not me , " Grant said quickly . " I 've got a lot of reading and studying to do if I 'm going to make this trip . " Evelyn smiled slowly at him , in silence . She had n't asked him . " Carol ? " she said in her raspy voice . " I think I will come down , " Carol said . She stood up , drawing herself up with brave but weary gallantry , and threw her head back . " My headache 's better . Maybe I 'll even have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good ! " Evelyn growled . " I 'll even make it for you . With my own little lilywhite hands . " She looked at Ron once , a hooded , enigmatic glance . Grant had followed them down the hall to where they turned off down the grand staircase . Neither of them had looked back , and he was supremely glad . " You poor darling , " he heard Evelyn say as they descended . " You really do overwork yourself , you know . With all your correspondence to those ' I'IU ' , , tre Group kids of yours . " " 1 know , " Carol had answered , and her voice was suddenly full of tears . " lint I do n't know what else to do . They all depend on me so . "  | But after he got over his fury and irritated disgust , he thought it really wonl ( 1 be a good thing to take her . Whether she believed in her last trip , p ; uting gift ' conditions or not , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to show her that . That he was quitting , that he was free . Whether he ever married Lucky Videndi or not . The final payoff , so to spe ; ik . The final kindness . Il ( at how did you explain any of all of that to a man like Bonham ? Grant locked over at him again at the little spoke-handled helmsman 's wheel iu h r the cockpit cabin roof . Bonham would kick them both in the cunt au ( d just up and walk out . Grant coughed and lit another cigarette . The big man was not whistling any more , and setfaced and flateyed was conscientiously occupying himself with the steering . They were back in the Hut in channel now , coming up on the looming Navy tender which was still In port . Then , as Grant was looking at him , he turned his head toward ( : r ; ( a ( t and smiled . Something had suddenly perked him up a little , and when he spoke Grant realized with consternation what it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll dock her at the Yacht Club again tonight anal t hen we can have a few gins at the bar to celebrate . " ( ; oldbloodedly and implacably , he was going to get every bit of good and valuable publicity out of his playwright and his playwright 's ray that he could get . And before Grant could say anything , or protest , he had swung the little boat in that way , cutting back the throttle . Why , then , did n't he protest ? Bonham would have , if he felt anything that strongly . They could still have come back out , and gone on to the small-boats , fisherman 's dock . But Grant did n't . Why ? Well , for one thing he knew that Bonham needed the publicity , or anyway could use it . Who knew , it might get him another customer or two ? But he had not anticipated that Bonham would actually go through with the whole Big Deal pro ( duction routine of it . Bonham did , however . The Yacht Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And when they saw the big ray , they all began to pour down onto the dock . Bonham made sure that they did . After ( locking , he got a gaffhook lashed to a quarter-inch manila line into the ray 's chin , and carried it all the way up the dock on his back to the banging rack where they hung the marlin during the marlin fishing tournaments . Ile said not a word , did n't grin , and  --  at least to Grant 's eye ? appeared to stoop under the weight of the fish a little more than was absolutely necessary . And when the crowd began to mill around them , he answered their questions matter-of-factly and laconically . In the end Grant posed for about twenty photographs with it .  | " Yes , " he could hear Bonham say over and over . " Yeah . Speared it , killed it , and brought it in . All by himself . What ? Three days . Three days ' diving , with me . Yeah . That 's right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wink at Grant when nobody was looking . Grant could have killed him . While enjoying a certain small fame and notoriety as a wellknown and successful playwright , he had never had the opportunity to complain about the kind of fame that goes with being a movie star , say , or a politician , and he did not have the professional knowhow , nor was he used to posing for photos . Some were tourists who knew his name and were also somewhat skittishly interested in skindiving . Others were Club Members who wanted him and the ray to add to their albums that they kept of the marlin tournaments each year . You could n't really be angry about it . But it embarrassed him . As the spectators continued to mill around , Bonham got out the official Club scales , had the results witnessed , got the thing down flat on the wood jetty , and began fileting out the wings . The meat was beautiful . And there was more than enough for all three of them . Ali who hated rays unfileted turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take home to his family of six . Grant got eight pounds and refused more , and there was still more than ten pounds for Bonham himself . And with Grant 's permission he gave five pounds to the Club Secretary . In the end there were many gins consumed at the bar , and for once Grant could not pay . It seemed everyone in the place wanted to buy them a drink . So he was a little loaded when All in the old station wagon dropped him off at the grand porte-cochere of the villa . He went straight to the kitchen . Bonham had thoughtfully , with no more communication between them than a wry knowing look , sliced up Grant 's chunks , utilizing the grain of the meat , to look like snapper filets . In the kitchen , where the French chef ( " Lucky Pierre , " he was called by Evelyn and Paul ) was waiting for him , he formally and dramatically turned over the fish with a somewhat malicious pleasure in the coup he and Bonham were putting over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ritzy household . Lucky Pierre assured him they would have it for dinner this night . Hunt and Carol were out on the big side veranda which overlooked the bay and harbor on the left of the point where Evelyn 's private beach lay below the smaller front veranda . Hunt , in a wicker chair , was holding a drink , a large highball glass , and staring pensively and rather sadly out over the harbor toward the big black lull in the west behind which the sun had by this time disappeared  | n golden haze . What was he thinking about ? Grant wondered suddenly , 3 he wondering , or worrying about , all this trouble that was going on ? Ifs ( bare-topped grizzled head with its thinning hair turned in the chair V ( : rant came out , and he looked up with a warm smile . Carol was readg and did not look up . " Was that your boat we saw ? The little white one that came in a while o ? " I I unt asked . " Ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Grant said . hit 's the one ! We saw it come in . It looks pretty seaworthy . " A ridicuis phrase , but the crowsfeet around his eyes were wrinkled with affect ' arid interest . Hunt knew nothing about boats . ( : curt shrugged . " It 's a good little boat . " " So ? I low did it go ? " ( : rant shrugged again . " Pretty good . I speared a sting ray . And some upper for dinner . " He gave him an affectionate little slap on the shoulr. " lint I 'm still scared . " He turned away . " Shit , I 'd be terrified ! " Hunt Abernathy called after him , pride in Grant In his voice . Carol had n't moved or looked up , and from over his shoulder Grant said ort ly , " Oh , by the way , Bonham says it 's all right about the trip to Grand Ilk , " and went to wash up for dinner .  | IT WAS A TRIP marked for disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did not seem so the morning of its beginning , as the little eightpassenger seaplane whirred in from Kingston in the joyous sub-tropic sunshine and bright blue sky , landed on the sparkling waters of the bay , and taxied over toward the Yacht Club where the four passengers were waiting for it on the veranda . It was such a beautiful day to be going anywhere . And the barometer was up and still rising Bonham said , which would mean good sun and quiet water in Grand Bank for spearfishing . It was nine-thirty when the plane arrived . Bonham had arranged for a Club dinghy to row them and their gear out to the plane , and the four of them stepped into it lightly , happy and laughing in the manner of carefree people anywhere going on a vacation , waving gaily to Hunt up on the veranda who had come to see them off , as the Club 's peon rowed them out . Grant and the Abernathys had risen early and breakfasted on Evelyn 's terrace in the fresh early-morning sun . When Hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlest and saddest mood had made Grant a secret little speech . She understood that of course he had a right to marry ; anybody of his choosing . She had always expected it would happen someday , had anticipated it , and she would n't have it any other way . It was only fair to Grant . And now she meant to make this last trip together , even though they were n't lovers anymore , something they would both remember with fondness and lasting friendship . What she hoped to accomplish by this , Grant did n't know . But the result of it though he hid it was to irritate and nettle him exceedingly , especially since Hunt reappeared just then with the car so that he was unable to make any satisfactory reply . But she appeared to mean just exactly what she said . At the Club , where they met  | nh.un and William , the five of them had played the European-type pool e awhile , laughing and roaring over Carol 's inadequacy at it , then had on the veranda in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d rwater-casemaker drinking Bloody Marys on Grant 's tab , Carol a tikh bitter lemon . She could be witty and great fun when she chose to rt herself at it , which had been less and less over the past years , and she de quite a thing over her awkwardness at the pool game . Too much , baps . But she was being a top sport , and thus Grant 's legitimate pity her and his guilts over her both increased . He need n't have worried though , because on the plane , once they were aboard , everything raged . Even before they were strapped in , she appeared to have suddenly vii a peculiar and personal dislike to Bonham , which she manifested by ting herself as far away from the big man as she could get , and then sitting there with an air of tacit disapproval for Bonham which made if Ieit all over the plane . After they were airborne , racing and bumping r the quiet bay to get the lift , and had unstrapped themselves so they hl move around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her big catchall purse , and stayed in her rearmost corner seat ying them . Grant , who had felt it was only polite to sit with her durg the takeoff , now felt obscurely irritated and moved forward with the r alive . There was no rational explanation for her to change so suddenly . ltahly , Grant stayed forward with the men and left her alone . N-uham , who with his animal sensitivity felt the change too , countered his own way , which was to pull out a bottle of gin , laughing and roaring it deliberately vulgar way . The tiny plane ( actually it was n't so tiny ; it only seemed so after the big to everybody was so used to seeing and riding ) of course had no stewcss . But Bonham was prepared for that too , and when he hauled forth gin  --  a bottle for which , surprisingly , Grant had not paid  --  he also nrglrt out of his faded duffel bag several bottles of Schweppes . " We ai nt any ice ! " he shouted ebulliently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preid were British ! " ( ' awl Abernathy of course did n't drink ; but when Bonham politely tied it to her , she primly refused even the plain tonic water . This did bother Bonham , or William , one bit ; nor did it much bother Grant , though lie was embarrassed for her . They had all had three Bloody Marys epic ( e at the Yacht Club , and they settled down to the warm gin and tonic end the exchange of diving stories to see them through the boring trip . And that was the tone the whole flight took , the rest of them drinking  | and talking , and trying to ignore the unpleasant presence of Carol Abernathy who continued to sit screaming silent disapproval forward at everyone from the rearmost seat . By the time Grand Bank Island hove into view off their starboard wing and the little seaplane sat down in the bright sun and sparkling water near the shore to taxi toward the hotel dock , they were all well on their way to being crocked . With William it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go diving for the rest of the afternoon . They were . Or so Bonham said . Grand Bank Island was just about exactly 365 British statute miles from Ganado Bay as the crow flies . However , for safety 's sake and because of the ban on flying over Cuba , the pilot had routed them via Cape Dame Marie and Cap a Foux in Haiti . This added a hundred miles to the trip , but it kept them near to land in case of trouble . Cruising at 90 miles an hour , allowing for wind drift , it was a five-and-a-half-hour flight . Normally the little plane was handled solely by its captain/pilot . But this time he had brought along a friend of his , a professional diver from Kingston whom Bonham knew , who also flew and had come along as copilot just for the ride to Grand Bank and some free spearfishing . The pilot , a South American who ran this flying-boat service for a big Venezuelan airline while waiting for assignment to jets , was also an ardent spearfisherman ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the intention of staying the full four or five days and spearfishing , rather than wasting the gas to return to Kingston and then come back . Once they were up and cruising , the co-pilot ' had come back to sit with them . He was a stocky , small , sandy-haired American with pale eyes and blond lashes named Jim Grointon . There was clearly no love lost between him and Bonham . They were competitors . But both men carefully kept their mutual antagonism within strictly limited civilized bounds , as if by some previously agreed-upon armed truce , and each pointedly made a point of not competing in telling bigger and better diving stories . Just the opposite , both leaned over backward in their modesties . When Bonham went up to sit with the pilot Raoul , who had said he would let him fly a little in level flight , Grant talked to Grointon . Jim Grointon , it came out slowly from both Grointon and William  --  like pulling teeth from Grointon ; more effusively from the praise-filled William ? was about as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pindar brothers . He owned his own boat in Kingston , which he had designed himself and had built there , a sort of sleek long catamaran which lie could convert into a diving platform with a huge retractable waterglass for div-  | You probably wo n't even see me and Raoul . There 's a big ethical question involved , and this is rather a ticklish situation . You 're Bonham 's client , and he 's coming to meet other clients . I ca n't do anything that might make it look like I was trying to horn in on his customers . " Suddenly he shrugged , very muscular shoulders rippling under his clean white T-shirt . Again he smiled that smile . " So you wo n't see much of us . I should n't have come at all . But when Raoul asked me , I could n't resist . I 've dived off Grand Bank and Mouchoir Reef . There 's some good stuff around there , if you know the spots . " " What do you mean by good stuff ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Big jewfish . " " How big is big ? " " With jewfish ? Oh , four five hundred pounds . " Grointon smiled again . For some reason Grant felt distinctly uncomfortable . The little ' Irishman ' was bragging without bragging . Grant reached for the bottles . " How about a little drink ? " " I ca n't . Not while I 'm working ' , " Grointon smiled . " But if you ever get down to Kingston for any reason , and want to go out , I 'd be glad to take you out . You ever do any freediving ? " " No . I never really did any lungdiving till I hooked up with Bonham . " Grointon nodded , and looked at him both appreciatively and speculatively . " You 've got the chest for it . " Then he grinned , an open honestly cynical grin very different from his smile . Grant liked him again . " Understand , I 'm not trying to rob Bonham 's customers . " " Okay , " Grant said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one little drink ? " " Sorry . Really ca n't while we 're flying . " It sounded smug to Grant . Still , he knew it was the truth . Under no such compunction himself , he made himself another , rather defiantly . He wondered what other conversation he could make with this strangely reserved and yet unreserved man . " You know , I 've read all your plays , " Grointon said . " I think they 're great . And I mean really great . You got the Navy and the wartime Navy man like none of those novels about it ever did . " " Well , thanks . " Embarrassment . Exactly the same embarrassment he had felt exposed to the cameras of the Yacht Club members with the big ray . " Is that your mother back there ? " Grointon asked suddenly . Grant looked up from the gin bottle with which he had been pouring . My God , did she really look that old ? " My foster-mother , " he said .  | " What 's eating on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's just in a mood , " Grant said , and looked back down at the ws ( ? hw ( 'ppes bottle he had exchanged for the gin bottle . " Well , I guess I better get back up front , " Grointon said in a peculiar ice . When Grant looked back up , the diver had a friendly smile on . " I a couple of course checks to make in a little bit , " he explained in what rant felt to be an overly warm way . Kit maybe that was just himself . He watched the too stocky but heavily tcscicd back walk away from him forward . Like most average athletes ho were never really great at anything , he had always secretly admired Iwrior athletes and at the same time disliked them too , perhaps because envied them . He turned to William who was sitting beside him and In . ( I which of the divers was the better one . " Well , they 're different , " William said . " You know ? Old Jim Grointon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's sports . oil know ? But Al Bonham is one of the best workin divers anywhere . taderwater salvage , pipelaying , cutting and welding , demolition and nsting , he 's tops at them all . It 's just different . Ya ca n't say which one 's Iter " It turned out as they talked that it was Bonham who had talked William In wiling his little shop in Miami and coming down to Jamaica . Bonham ( I promised him they would clean up . So far they was n't . But they was II , i big chance they would . William could n't really complain . With a fe and four kids he could live half as cheap here as in Miami . They lotilcliu  --  t of afforded no maid in Miami ! William it turned out was no diver d had never even been in a mask , except once in a swimming pool , let me no aqualung . It was dangerous , people like Bonham and Grointon hiho clone it were crazy anyway , and William would not be caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big cleanup down here on his lies with Bonham like Bonham had promised him . And if Bonham ever dot this schooner thing off the ground , they would . When the big diver came back from the cockpit to concentrate on his drinking and interrupted this explication by roaring with laughter at WilUanc . Grant found himself looking at the big man with a new eye and in a Mac light . The new light was William 's information . It took a certain amount of something peculiar  --  what ? moral irresponsibility ? ? to get another man to throw up his security and go off on a goose chase ( with wife atcl f our kids ! ) when you were n't even sure you could deliver and back up your promises . And in the back Carol Abernathy still sat screaming silent ata ( i Nelfsatisfied disapproval at everyone from her lonely seat .  | They circled the hotel once , everybody looking down at the sprawling buildings and the docks and at the manager who came running out waving his arms . On the dock there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three colored in clothes who also waved their arms at them . As they touched down and taxied in , a good-sized dinghy put out from the dock to take them off , and when Bonham with his stormcloud eyes now slightly drink-glazed offered his aid to help her climb down , Mrs. Carol Abernathy accepted it primly with a prim squeezed mouth . Grant could have booted her in the ass overboard . Suddenly he giggled to himself . When it came his turn , he saw that the two men in trunks and floppy hats in the boat , who were busily stowing gear and passengers here or there to keep the dinghy balanced , could only be Sam Finer and Orloffski by Bonham 's previous descriptions . Orloffski with a bullet head and butch haircut could indeed have been a guard on a pro football team , and anywhere but around Bonham would have been a big man . Finer was small and swarthy , deeply tanned , with a noticeable paunch but with broad strong shoulders . His eyes appeared as hard as two rocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant shook hands with them , his hand getting badly squeezed both times , and introduced himself , before sitting down where he was told to sit . They were having a great time being boatmen , it appeared ; but they had not known that Jim Grointon and Mrs. Abernathy were coming , so their boat did n't really have enough room to take everybody . " That 's all right ! Do n't worry about us ! " Grointon called cheerfully . " We 'll make out all right ! Me and Raoul have to secure the plane first , anyway ! " Raoul , Grant thought , and a memory of Lucky shivered through him for the first time in maybe half an hour . He felt a double twinge in his gut , one for the absence of Lucky and one for the existence  --  former existence ? of Raoul , her Raoul . What the hell was he doing down here in the Caribbean with all these professional outdoor types anyway ? It suddenly arose in his mind as a curiosity that while he had thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or had a hard-on ( except in the morning ) for the past five or six days he 'd been diving . It was the last he was to see of Grointon or Raoul really , until the next evening when they returned with a mess of smaller fish , and one six foot ten inch ground shark Grointon had taken all alone . A considerable prize , at least to Grant 's eyes . On the dock they were introduced to Finer 's and Orloffski 's wives .  | is wife was beautiful . And with a guilty start , when he looked into ryes as they shook hands , Grant was suddenly sure that he knew her n before in New York . But he could not remember for the life of him flier he had fucked her or not . Ibuiliam had told him Cathie Finer was a New York model , goodlookrrdheaded , and that Finer had met her on a business trip to New York months ago . But that was like introducing somebody to a New York bic and asking if you had ever happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lovely gray eyes appeared to be pleading with him in tt : appeal to keep his mouth shut . This was not their honeymoon he remembered Bonham saying , which had spent in Miami Beach , but was by way of being a second honey ) ti , and was the first time Sam had introduced her into his skindiving lal . Then , as he was afterwards shaking hands politely with Orloffski 's rp ' ( not fat ; but with loose flesh hanging out all over ) loudmouthed ft. ' , lie remembered . It was a couple of years ago , when he had been in the city and was gitig around with another novelist ( not Frank Aldane ) and his sort of hltown ' Village set . The novelist had introduced him to this girl he had ri taking out , a favor from one artist to another , at a Saturday night rtv . They had spent a hard-humping , do-it-every-way , love-sweaty ekriid in her drab but not unpleasant little flat  --  which weekend , beuse she was not working the first part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He remembered she told him no one had et eaten her pussy so beautifully . But the weekend , though they both trd hard , had given neither of them more than a pleasantly sexual weekil so that they parted wistfully as friends . He had seen her at a couple of her parties afterwards . That was Cathie Finer . ( : rant had once several years ago casually picked up a copy of Playboy d discovered to his delight and astonishment that the Playmate of that ) Aoiitli was a young female poet he had only a couple of months before went another such hard-loving New York weekend with ; and this experience was rather like that one : He had studied the nude photos of her preliilly and with lascivious possessiveness . His ego was so thrilled he wanted to run out into the streets of the Hunt Hill suburb of Indianapolis with the magazine and start accosting friends with it . Lamely , and belatedly , he realized his local pals would probably think he was lying , and if they did n't would not care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had to them . It was a very frustrating kind of triumph ; and so was this . Nobody seemed to have noticed anything , and Grant next shook hands with the hotel manager . He hardly glanced at Cathie Finer again . He did not want to hurt Cathie 's marriage , he did not want to hurt Finer , most of all he did not want to hurt Bonham 's chances of selling Sam Finer on the schooner . Of all the places in the world to run onto somebody you had laid ! He shot a quick glance at Carol Abernathy who , in spite of her vaunting of her much-publicized feminine intuition , seemed not to have noticed anything either . Immediately he was disgusted . They were n't even lovers anymore . What a powerful force was habit . The diving boat , an even larger dinghy than the one that picked them up , had already been prepared for them ( Finer and Orloffski had had it out all morning with their ladies , in fact ) and Bonham , Finer and Orloffski were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look after their luggage . All they had to do was change to swim suits and take off . Cathie Finer and Wanda Lou , which was Orloffski 's girlfriend 's name , had decided they would not go along on this short afternoon dive , having had too much sun already during the long morning , and they were telling this to Carol Abernathy behind Grant . And at this point Carol decided she would not go out either but would stay back at the hotel with the girls ' she said . She seemed already to have taken a great liking to Cathie and her sensitive eyes and face . But when Grant merely nodded and did n't say anything , Carol called him over to one side . " You 're really going ? Without me ? " Now what ? he thought . " Of course I 'm going ! That 's what I came on this trip for , was to dive . " He thought perhaps he might have swayed a little . He was drunker than he thought . " Well , then do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out your clothes for you , " she said viciously , " you or him ! " She jerked her head toward Bonham . " I do n't expect you to do any-goddam-thing ! " Grant almost shouted . He was suddenly dangerously angry , and trying hard to avoid a public scene . " The houseboys are supposed to do all that . He just told us , " he said more quietly . " I just want you to know that you do n't need to expect any help from me for anything , on this trip , " Carol said with a mean smile . " Okay ! I do n't ! " Bonham came over to them then . " ltoli , the manager wants to know about the rooms , " he said in the slow  | Cairn immutable style he employed when teaching . " William 's payin his own way , and he 's got a little room up in the back cheap ; he knows the manager from before . Mrs. Abernathy will want a room by herself of course , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up together . Save you the price of one room . " For a moment Grant could n't think , did n't even hear , he was still so gry . " Okay , " he said shortly . " Fine . Sure . Why not ? " He was thinking that bunking with Bonham would certainly save him from any chance of being importuned by Carol Abernathy 's coming into his room at night and what was more , she would know this . All right , " Bonham said . " I 'll tell him . Shall we go and change ? " His eyes were still glassy from the gin he 'd drunk . But he was gently and Itly elbowing Mrs. Abernathy right out of the play . It was what Grant onld have liked to do , and in the same way . " Sucre . I 'm coming , " Grant said , and turned on his heel and left . The hotel was constructed of separate , chambered annexes around a central dining hall and bar . In the room he flung himself down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confessed how drunk he was . " What I really feel like doin is laying right here and going to fucking sleep . " Frorn beside the other bed where he had started to undress Bonham Isughed . " Well , that 's up to you . But since you 're payin anyway , you ought to go . As an added inducement , I can tell you from experience the best way to sober up now  --  and to avoid an early evening hangover  --  is to go diving with us . " He swayed a little himself , as he got out of his Jockey shorts underwear . " And besides , I 'm scared . " *  | under the shade of the trellises . It was Grant 's turn not to answer . When the sun hit them , it was like a physical blow . The women had disappeared . And Finer and Orloffski were waiting on the dock impatiently . " Come on ! I 'm burnin my goddam motherfuckin feet off standin here , " Orloffski said in his blunt , brutal voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked pleasantly . " Anngh , " Orloffski answered . All of them except him wore the Japanese style shower clogs , made in America with sponge rubber bottoms and the hard rubber coming up between the toes , and which in fact Bonham had recommended that Grant buy for himself in Ganado Bay . Gook boots ' they had used to call the real ones , the straw ones , back in the old days at Pearl , Grant thought . " His fuckin broad stoled ' em off him , Al , " Sam Finer said in a curiously thin , high voice for such a chesty man , " that 's what . " " She did no such a goddam thing , " Orloffski cursed . " He lost one this morning on the boat , " Finer grinned . Bonham shoved them off . It was perfectly true that the diving and the swimming sobered them up , and in some mysterious way of its own precluded a hangover . And when they came back in , Grant felt much better physically . But that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the first place it was too late , when they finally got started , to go down around the point to the so-called lagoon ' , or to any of the other good spearfishing spots . So instead Bonham had run them straight out past the now-anchored and deserted airplane , almost a mile out from the hotel dock , and here he anchored them . The water was no more than fifteen feet deep , a flat sand bottom with almost no coral , and consequently almost no fish , and it appeared to run straight out to sea indefinitely at that depth . In fact , Bonham said , they would have to go out miles and miles in that direction to find any deeper bottom , almost to Inagua . Currents had made it a sort of dead area , piling up sand to make an uninhabited bank . But Bonham , it became immediately clear , did n't care , because what he meant to do was to concentrate on Sam Finer and the little Minox camera and case he had brought over for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying down as long as you can , " was all he said to Grant , and then he disappeared with Finer . If Finer liked the little camera , he said , he would give it to him . Sam Finer appeared to be a pretty good sport . But of course he had been ( living all morning , too . And he did have the camera to play with . I le was the only one of them who had any real diving gear , having at great  | expense flown down a Scott Hydro-Pak with three filled sets of double tanks , since filtered air was not available on Grand Bank . In the boat he put this on , aided by Bonham and Orloffski , even though the depth was ly fifteen feet , and leaped over the side . To save air he breathed only ough the snorkel-like air economizer ' on the side of the fullface mask . using only a snorkel , went with him and handed him the came . Orloffski , who was no good sport at all , took up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went trudgeoning off by himIf . In the water no more than twelve seconds , Grant suddenly found Ins if totally alone . fifteen feet was no deeper than the deep end of most swimming pools , o bottoms of a number of which Grant had prowled around holding his ? atli . It was n't even deep enough to bother clearing your ears . It cerinlv was no way to go about learning something about real freediving. n ( l most swimming pool bottoms were more interesting than this . At 1. t there you could pick up hairpins and a marble or two . A few needleh torpedoed themselves along behind their long thin snouts here and so , a few tiny , brightly colored sergeant-majors explored the sand or grass . That was all . Angry over the attitude of Carol Abernathy , angry over how much he s spending on this trip , angry over the freediving lessons Bonham had ouiiised but was n't giving , he swam around the area near the boat , saw and explored his first sea hare which he had read of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as limp pie dough folded into a tart , Watching with a kind of awed distaste the brown ink that spilled from its brow ? interior as his poking speartip tore it open , practiced diving down to the sand or the sea grass and holding his breath , until bored to death he began to expand his circles and move away from the boat . When he did , he saw out at the extreme limit of his visibility Orloffski going after fish , and swam over that way . The big Polack had found a small thinly growing patch of coral . A fishsh.intier was tied to his bikini and on it were several small parrotfish , none lul them n a foot long . As Grant swam up , he went after another one . The man who looked like a pro football guard went after these small creatures with tlhe same viciousness with which Grant had seen Bonham go after Urger fish , only more so . With brutal , animal , totally selfish singlemindedprss he dived down on another little parrotfish as Grant watched , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now had six . Grant waved to him and swam off , back to his boring round . He did n't have the heart to shoot the dumb , adenoidal-looking little fish , and wondered if he was weak .  | Mostly as he dove down and lay on the grass or sand holding his breath , he thought about Cathie Finer , and about how strange it was that after knowing her that one time and then never seeing her again in New York , he should meet her again in Godforsaken Grand Bank Island in the lower Bahamas , where her new husband was perhaps about to go into the schooner business with his new friend and diving teacher . Thinking of Cathie also brought him back to thinking wistfully of Lucky . He wondered if Cathie knew her ? When he heard Bonham yelling in his full bull voice from the boat , he motioned to Orloffski who was still further out , and swam back to it . It turned out the camera was busted . Not really busted , but the pushand-pull cocking mechanism which William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had gotten worse and worse until they could no longer cock the camera . Bonham had called them so they could go back in and he and William could work on it for tomorrow . The usually impassive Bonham looked highly irritable , and when Orloffski swam up with his string of little parrotfish and made as if to pass them up , he bawled , " What the hell are you doing with those goddam things ? " " I hadda have somethin to do to pass the fucking time , " Orloffski said in his brutal way . " Then throw them the goddam hell away ! " said Bonham . " What do you want me to do with them ? " " Do n't give me orders . Maybe some of the niggers 'll want them , " Orloffski said bluntly , and instead threw them into the boat . Treading water as he watched this small bucking of heads , Grant noticed something that he had observed before but never really noted : he had never heard Bonham use the word fuck ' in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot himself , and so did most of the people in his more or less sophisticated world , though not with the totally vulgar brutality of Orloffski , and you would have thought Bonham would use it too . Saying nothing ? and doing nothing , except to note that Sam Finer was carefully studying Orloffski with his rock-hard eyes  --  he climbed up into the boat . " Go on ahead . I 'll swim back , " Orloffski said . " Probably wo n't see nothin but it wo n't hurt to look . Throw me your stringer . " Bonham tossed it to him . The boat began to move away from him , and Grant watched his head get smaller and smaller behind them until it disappeared . They were pretty close to a mile from shore , and he would not have liked to stay there like that , without even a companion , to swim back alone . I  --  ven though the depth was only fifteen feet a shark or two could come cruising  | by any time . It did n't seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wash all the dried salt off him and lay down on his one of c twin beds and immediately fell sound asleep . It was while Grant was asleep , when Bonham was returning from Wilam 's room to wash his grimy hands after working with William on the aura case , that Carol Abernathy stuck her head out cautiously from the door of her own room and stopped him in the dim hall . " I want to talk to you a minute , Al , if I may . " Bonham stopped and stared down at her anxious , darkeyed , and nowconspiratorial face . He had had enough trouble today already , with the damned camera not working . " All right , Mrs Abernathy . What is it ? " " Come and walk over to the dining room with me . " She moved her head toward the next door . " Ron is sleeping . " She was already dressed for dinDer in a flowered print frock . Bonham took a moment to decide . He had n't been too upset by her so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it certainly had n't made things any pleasanter . " Okay . " " I expect you 've been wondering why I acted so strangely to you today On the plane , " she said as they came out into the trellised walkway . It was almost dark now . Soon the manager and one houseboy would be starting up the big outdoor gasoline-driven auxiliary generator in order to carry all flit . extra room , hall and outdoor walkway lights . It would continue to chug noticeably amongst the insect noises all through the rest of the night util the last one went to bed , when the watchman would turn it off till the next night . " Well , no . Not so much , " Bonham said . " It seemed sort of strange and Madden after the fun we 'd all been having at the Yacht Club , though . " Ste ' nodded , a fast , primly eager nod . " I had a very special reason . " She did not continue and waited , but Bonham would not respond . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , leaning toward him , " I hove reason to think that Ron might be thinking about wanting to put Pone money into this schooner deal of yours . " " Yon know about that ? " " t ) li , everybody knows about that . " " I do n't think they-do , " Bonham said bluntly . " Well , then , maybe Ron has told me . Does that matter ? " Bonham shook his head . " Well , in any case , I think it would be a very good thing for Ron if he 1 did do this . Ile could put up five thousand , even ten thousand dollars , if be really wanted to , you know . And I think it would be good for him . "  | " Then why ? " Bonham began . " Because that 's just the way he is , " Carol Abernathy said , obscurely . She went on . " He does just the opposite every time of what I want him to do . Therefore , my plan in being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push him the other way . If Ron thinks I like you and would like to see him put money into your boat ? " Bonham 's nerves jangled at the way she called the big schooner a ' boat ' . " ? then he would automatically refuse to do it . On the other hand , if he thought I was dead set against you and your project , he would be much more inclined to want to do it with you . " Now ; do n't you think that was wise of me ? " " I guess so , " Bonham said . " But , tell me , why do you feel you want Ron to go into this thing with me ? After all , you hardly know me . " " For his health , " Carol Abernathy said . " For his health , and for his mental health . He works very hard at his plays , you know . It 's a very nervousmaking , very wear-and-tearing kind of work . Because of that he needs all the pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and diving with you like that every so often , say three or four times a year , would be the best thing in the world for him ! " They had reached the door to the big diningroom  --  bar , and the voices of the others came out faintly to them through the screens where they stood among the mosquitoes . Suddenly the big generator began to chug and all the extra lights , all those not in the main building , went on all over . " So if I pretend to be your enemy ' now and again , every now and then , you 'll understand what my purpose is , wo n't you ? " Carol Abernathy said primly . " And you 'll know that I 'm really on your side , and trying to help you with your deal . " " I 'll think about it , " Bonham said , somehow perplexed . " You want me to go ahead and try to sell him on it ? " " Of course I do ! Did n't I just tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocktail with that nice sweet Cathie . " Bonham watched her walk away from him with that hunchbacked , very selfsatisfied walk she sometimes got . Then he turned on his heel and went back to do his interrupted washing up . Grant was asleep on one of the beds as he came in , with only a towel thrown across his crotch and under it what was very obviously an enormous hard-on . Grinning , Bonham did his washing up before he waked him for dinner . When he touched the playwright gently on the shoulder , Grant sat up like a flash , grabbed at the towel on his crotch and blushed . Bonham only laughed , roaring . " Do n't worry , I wo n't tell anybody ! Come on and get dressed and let 's go eat . "  | " 11W ( ERE IS EVERYBODY ? " Grant said as he came back out of the bathroom . IIe had grabbed up his shorts and slacks and taken them in there with him and put them on in the bathroom . " They 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned camera with William and came back to wash up . " Then Bonham grinned . " Did you have a good pee ? " Grant looked embarrassed , and Bonham roared again . Grant reached for his shirt . " I guess I better hurry up . " It ai nt nothin to be ashamed of , " Bonham said , and a sudden fleeting ( Lurk look which Grant did not understand crossed his face . " I Las Ca Has Mrs. Abernathy gone over yet ? " " Yeah . She 's already there . She seems to have taken quite a shine to Cathie Finer . " Grant put on his shirt and a pair of rope-soled espadrilles . " I noticed that . Well , maybe it 'll be good for her . Come on , let 's go . " They walked down the hall as far as the door outside in a sort of cautious silence . " What 's the matter with her ? " Bonham said finally . " Is she some kind of nuts or something ? " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the kind of nuts you 'd have to lock tip or anything . Or dangerous . She 's highly neurotic though , I think . " " Where I come from somebody would up and knock her on her ass , " Iloiihiam said unequivocally . " It might do her some good . Then again , it might not do her any good at all . At least with Cathie Finer here she 'll have somebody to talk to . Wanda l.ou 's not much of a talker . " " The hell she 's not ! " Bonham said . " I mean , she talks . But she does n't say much of anything . "  | " That 's fer damn sure , " Bonham growled . " You seem to be having your troubles with her husband , too , " Grant said with a slight smile . Bonham 's face looked suddenly weary , stoically weary . " Well , he 's got that cutter of his which we could sure use . And when he sells the building where he had his sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put in . I just hope we can get old Sam to go for the schooner deal . I think we can get her for seven or eight thousand . But she 'll need a good bit of yard work . " " What does he say about it ? " Grant said casually . " I have n't had a chance to talk to him yet . We 're going to talk to him tonight . " " But he knows about it ? " " Yeah , he knows about it . You would n't like to put some money in it yourself , would you ? " Bonham asked , rather heavily Grant thought . They had been walking along the walkway , an uncovered one now , between the widely spaced lights and between them you could see the starstudded sky , each star gleaming like a lightbulb in the clear , absolutely cloudless tropic canopy . Mosquitoes did n't much bother Grant , and he had been enjoying it , the air smelling of sea , the insect noises in the slight breeze , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was suddenly startled , shocked even . He had been expecting this question to come , sometime , but now that it had he was still startled . " Who , me ? No , no ; no , no . I have n't got that kind of money . Shit , I wish I had . " " As a part owner , you 'd get all your diving cruises and trips free . Say three or four a year . Ten days . Or two weeks . We could cruise up here , cruise to Tortuga in Haiti , cruise to the Caymans , cruise to Cozumel and Yucatan even . Be a lot of fun . Lot of diving . " " I do n't have that kind of money , " Grant said quickly . " It sounds great , but I do n't have that kind of money at all . " " Would n't have to put in as much as Finer . Say three thousand . Even two thousand . For starters . Well , think about it . We 'll talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main building 's porch . Far inside , in the dim bar with its lights gleaming on local pine paneling , they could see the others , and a faint murmur of talk and laughter and glasses clinking came out to them . It sounded good , happy , as if they two were about to enter a group of people with no problems who had nothing to do but enjoy themselves and life . Bonham must have been trapped by the same illusion . IIe stopped with his big hand on the door handle and took a  | very deep breath , which he then let out in a long slow sigh . It seemed to take a full minute for him to complete his exhale . " Meantime , " he said , his eves taking on a really fierce , ferocious look , " I 'm gon na eat ! And drink ! " I le went in . Grant followed . It was maybe another full hour before they sat down to dinner , and during that time they all except for Carol Abernathy put away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since it was the first night , and the drinks were all on the house . He was a heavydrinking , half-English , half-white-Jamaican man with a penchant for telling very good , mildly dirty stories which no one had ever heard before , in a very King 's English voice . He had known Bonham , Grointon and Raoul the pilot for years , and had built his hotel here all by himself and was in filet more than half owner of it . He liked to talk about diving and listen to diving stories but had never done any of it and did not , he said , ever intend to . Sam Finer on the other hand could not talk about anything else except diving , and his overwhelming passion for it earned him a good deal of razzing from the others . His admiration and hero-worship for Bonham was even greater than Grant 's . The drinks flowed freely , since the black barman had received instructions from the manager to keep all glasses filled , and when they went to dinner finally they were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the British manager liked to say . " I 'm pissed ! " he said . The dinner was free too , anyway , since it was composed solely of seafood which they had caught themselves , and the manager as host was serving a very good white wine , a Muscadet which he imported himself via Nassau from Europe for his guests , and which , being served freely also , did not allow the ingestion of food to sober anybody up . By the time dinner was o% er they were all except for Carol Abernathy even more pissed than before it started . " More pissed ! " the manager hollered . Finer and Orloffski had taken several big crawfish , or langouste as they were getting to be tailed more and more , which was served first in a Bahamian recipe with a very hot sauce . After that there were high-piled platters of batter-fried fish  --  grouper , snapper , hogfish , rockfish  --  enough to feed a small army . liner and ' Mo ' Orloffski , as he liked to hear himself called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know just when Carol Abernathy went to bed . All he knew was that suddenly he looked up and found she had gone ; as had Orloffski and his loudmouth girlfriend , not intending to waste any more goddam valuable sacktime , as Orloffski so handsomely put it ; he could imagine their stablelike sex life . Grointon and Raoul were just in the process of leaving , Bonham and Sam Finer were down at the far end of the room talking business in low voices , and he himself was sitting over coffee with Cathie Finer who was a little drunk too and the manager , who was very drunk . The manager was just on the point of excusing himself sleepily to go to bed , which he did , and then cautiously got up and stiff and erect as the Guards Officer he said he once was , marched carefully from the room . Grant and Cathie were left alone . " Thanks for this afternoon , " she said in a quiet voice with a small smile . " Are you kidding ? " Grant asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not if I could possibly help it . " " I know that . But when they told us you were coming , and I knew you did n't know I was here , I was afraid when you saw me that you might say something or let something out , just out of surprise . " Grant shook his head with stubborn drunken bonhommie . " Bonham told me that Finer had recently married a goodlooking New York model . But of course I did n't connect it with you , or think I might have known you . It 's weird , is n't it ? I mean , it 's funny . Meeting down here like this . " I like your husband , " he added gallantly , although the truth was he did n't know Sam Finer well enough yet to like him or not . Cathie Finer looked straight at him soberly for a moment before she answered . " He 's a nice man , Sam . And he 's worth a lot of money . He 's kind of crude maybe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's a very nice man . And he needs me , " she added simply . " Well good for you , " Grant said . For no reason he could feel a kind of twisting gripe inside himself . He had never really known her , just that one long weekend together . He had never tried to explore her . Of course , she had probably changed some too in the past two years . " God only knows why he needs me , " Cathie Finer said . " But he says he does . And after thirty-two , modeling gets to be slimmer and slimmer . And slimmer . Unless you 're a Dorian Leigh or somebody and can open up your own business . " She smiled . " He does n't step out on me , and I do n't step out on him . See , Sam 's a very jealous man . Anyway I wanted to thank you . " " I I ( II. " ( : rant flushed . " Forget it . " " And I also wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cathie Finer said , her voice getting a little straighter .  | " Yeah ? " Grant said . " What about ? " " Well , first place , she 's not really your foster-mother , is she ? " Cathie Finer said quietly . " She 's your mistress , is n't she ? " Only a few people had ever asked him that question pointblank . Lucky had been one . He had always denied it . " She was , " he said , not really knowing why he was admitting it now . " I like her , " Cathie Finer said . " She 's got a lot of marvelous qualities in her . She 's a nice woman . And she 's just about to crack up . " " You think so ? " " I sure do . And I 'm guessing that it 's all because of you , is n't it ? " Grant wanted to talk suddenly . " Well , it is and it is n't , you know ? This thing you see in her 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've been there and seen it grow . She used to be marvelous . When she was younger . Or else I was just too young and green to see that she was n't . " He stopped to collect his thoughts , which were in some confusion . He could n't remember what he meant to say next . He found he was both shocked and surprised by Cathie Finer 's sympathy for Carol , and a little angered . " Well , you see , I do n't know what I can do about it . If she is beginning to crack up . " " She broke down and sort of cried three times this afternoon when she and I were talking . " " Did she talk about me to you , you mean ? " " No , no . Not at all . Except for that son shit , you know ? " " Well , she helped me a lot when I was younger and just starting out . She and her uh her husband , who is down here in Jamaica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , hell , Cathie , she 's old enough to be my mother . No , now ! I mean it . Literally . She 's eighteen years older than I am . And I 've paid them both back pretty much , pretty well . Should I he expected to throw away the whole rest of my life for her ? " Cathie Finer shifted a little in her chair . " Well , it 's not my problem , of course . I should n't butt my nose in . But I liked her . And I just wanted you to know how close to the edge she is . " " You really think so ? But she 's been more or less like that for three years now . Almost exactly the same . Listen , Cathie , do you know a girl named I , ncky Videndi ? " " Lucky Videndi ? Lucky Videndi ? Why , yes ! Yes , I do know her ! Not very well . She never did very much modeling . But I used to see her at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loot of her own , I think . " She looked at Grant closely . " So that 's how it is ? " Grant flushed for the second time . " That 's how it is . Just like with you and Sam . "  | " She 's a real beauty ! . . . Well , that poor lady ! " Cathie said , helplessly . Then , as his second phrase took effect , she turned and looked down at her husband sitting with Bonham , and smiled proudly . In Grant 's mind a small rebellion took place , something he did not want , did not want his mind to think , but which his mind maliciously went ahead and thought anyway . He had known her quite intimately , that weekend , and his mind viciously began recalling her in full intimate detail . His mind was not as gallant or gentlemanly as he was . She had peculiarly shaped labia minora , for example . Nobody can take that away from us , his mind giggled . At the same time from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile fondly toward Finer , Grant overheard the words " stock " , " loan " , and " interest " . " . . . do n't want any stock . . . your baby . . . longterm loan . .. low rate of interest . . . two percent . . . even one and a half .. just do n't want to own stock in another man 's . . Cathie Finer turned back to him . " Wish you luck anyway , Ron , " she said . Then she shook her head . " What I really mean is , I wish that poor lady , that poor Mrs Abernathy luck . She 's the one that 's going to need it . " " Let 's talk about something more pleasant , " Grant said . " What about your husband ? Do you think Sam will go in on Bonham 's schooner deal ? " Cathie Finer 's face got cautious . " I try not to know anything about Sam 's businesses . But I know he loves diving with a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonham . " She smiled brilliantly . " He 's small , you know , smaller than you . He loves to have big men around him . .. . " Now let me ask you something . " Why do you think it was that you and I never really made it together ? " " Ahhh , " Grant said . " Who the hell knows ? That was what , more than two years ago . I guess , just guessing you understand , neither one of us really wanted to make it with somebody then . We both have changed a lot since then . " " But you really have it solid and hard for Lucky Videndi , do you ? " Cathie smiled . " I sure do . At least , as far as I can tell now . " " Well , as you told me a while ago , good for you . " Down at the other end of the room the two talking men got up and ctuue toward them . Sam Finer hardly came up to Bonham 's armpit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ? " Finer said iii his high voice , his rock ! and eyes moving fast from one to the other and hack. lle was pretty drnk , too . And it was easy to see he was an intensely jealous man .  | " Mostly talking about diving , " Grant said easily , and then grinned . " And a little bit about whether you might be interested in going in on Bonham 's schooner . " I 've had your broad , you dumbhead , his mind giggled suddenly . He hated his mind . Finer grinned drunkenly . " If you were pumping my wife about any of my business affairs , I 'm sure you did n't get very far . " " You 're absolutely right . " " But , " Finer said , " I think I can tell you , I guess it 's safe enough to tell you , it looks like Bonham 's goin to get his fucking schooner . " From behind him Bonham nodded once , happily , as Grant stood up quickly . " Well ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm glad ! A congratulations drink at the bar maybe ? John ! " he called . The black barman , bored as only a black barman can be when he is amongst a bunch of happy white drunks and is wanting to close up and go ! mane , began setting up four glasses . He could n't have cared less about Bonham 's schooner , or anything else , and almost certainly had n't even been listening . " What 's the matter with you ? " Sam Finer growled suddenly , and his eyes just as suddenly got dangerous . " Ai nt you glad Mister Bonham 's gon na get him a schooner ? " " Hey , hey , " Bonham said quietly , and Grant watched Cathie get up quickly and go stand just a tiny bit in front of Sam 's right shoulder . " Oh , yes , sahr , " the barman said . His face grinned . " I is veddy hoppy . " " Then set up a glass for yourself ! " Finer ordered . The barman did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formally , holding their glasses high to each other while Grant pronounced it , he calmly drank it with them . Sam Finer slammed his glass butt-down hard on the bar , and put his arm around his wife . " All I want is for us to be on that first cruise . " " That 's for sure , " Bonham said quietly , " and absolutely certain . " " Cone on , old lady , " Finer grinned , " let 's go hit the sack . I 'm drunk and lonesome and beat . I need me some loving . " When they had gone , Bonham let out a long , tension-relaxing " whew ! " " Will he remember in the morning ? " Grant said . " Oh , sure . I 've seen him a lot drunker than that . I 'm beat too as a matter of fact . But I ai nt going to bed . John , " he said to the barman , " give us one more and we 'll let you close up and go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barman grinned . " I ic 's not bad , you know . It 's just he Bits a little rambunctious sometimes when he 's drunk . " " No need tell me . I know the type . " Ile filled their glasses .  | " You 're not going to sleep ? " Grant said as they touched glasses . " No , " Bonham said very matter-of-factly . " You think he 'll really come through ? " " Yeah , he 'll come through . He 's like my grandfather used to say : My word is my bond . ' But only as a loan . He wo n't take any stock . I do n't know why . But Do n't look a gift horse in the mouth . " ' " How much is he letting you have ? " " Ten thousand . " Grant whistled , and raised his eyebrows . Bonham acknowledged this with a nod . " It 's a real break . Of course , he 'll get all his divin and diving trips free . In perpetuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost him almost that much in five years , " Grant said . Bonham nodded . " You 're really not going to bed ? " Grant asked . " No , I 'm going in to town , " Bonham said matter-of-factly . " Maybe get me some of that handsome black ass . You should pardon the expression , John . " " Harr , Misteh Bonham , " John grinned . " This is a day I do n't want to forget . I never really thought he 'd come through . You want to come along ? " Grant thought it over while he finished his drink . " Your pal Orloffski did n't help you a whole hell of a lot . " " No , " Bonham said . " He did n't , did he ? Well , " he said and sighed , " I told you he was a clot . " The British word sounded strange in his American mouth , to Grant . Go to town ? An explosive charge was working in him , probably from all the booze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of raging disgust at himself over the way at least part of him had reacted to Cathie Finer . And he did n't want to have to see Carol Abernathy , should she still be up . " Sure . I 'll come . But we have to be up and ready to go divin by eight . " Bonham grinned from behind his stormcloud eyes . " The hell with it . We 'll just stay up all night then . " " All right . Good ! " Grant said just as toughly . As it turned out , they did n't stay up all night . They were back by fivethirty . But in the light of what happened after that , it might have been better if they had stayed up . " But how 're we gon na get there ? " Grant asked as they left John in his bar cleaning up . " Oh , that 's the easiest part , " Bonham promised . It appeared that the hotel manager had three cars on the premises , and the oldest most beat-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always kept reserved for Bonham when he was  | here . The keys were in it . Sometimes he took clients diving in it , in the daytime , on the other side of the island . " But wo n't somebody steal it ? Like that ? " Grant asked as he climbed in . ? " What would they do with it ? " Bonham said . " They could n't drive it , or hide it , on the island . And they could n't get it off . There 's only about four hundred people live on this r oek . " He had thoughtfully brought along a bottle of scotch whiskey from the hotel bar , and they each had two slugs from it on the mile and a half trip in to the town . I n the pale light of the thin crescent moon the town itself , named  --  like No many other tiny Caribbean towns on tiny islands  --  simply Georgetown , had an eerie aspect . It consisted of maybe sixty ramshackle buildings made of coral rock and wood with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses and six were bars . Not one wall could truly be said to be in plumb , and all in all it made the village of Ganado Bay look like a sleek great modern city . Like in any port town at two in the morning , whereas the respectable places such as warehouses and homes were shut up tight and darkened , all of Georgetown 's six gin mills down by the wharves were wide awake and going full blast . And as long as any money was coming in they would stay that way . One of the reasons they did not stay out all night was because on the way into town in the car Grant made it plain that he was not on the lookout for any fucking . " You ai nt ? " Bonham said , though he still did not use the word itself , and then he grinned . " From the way you looked under that towel back at the hotel when I woke you up , you looked about ready for something . " So for the first time Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York that he might marry and that he was uh  --  ludicrous phrase  --  keeping himself for . The big man 's face changed instantly and got respectable and he nodded his great head ponderously with equally ludicrous understanding ; but it put a sort of damper on things because he too then decided , with gentlemanly thoughtfulness , that he too should not try to get laid either . So they went from joint to joint , drinking more and more whiskey and eating more and more hamburgers , watched the various crops of available girls , and talked about diving and courage . Bonham was not worried about Grant 's courage ; he had seen him In two fairly tight spots , the swim through the cleft into the big cave and the shooting of the ray , though neither was seriously dangerous , and he had functioned perfectly fine . He had also seen his springboard diving ? which was why he let him do those things so fast , in the first place . Bonhum would trust him anywhere completely , soon 's he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not keep two drunken men awake forever . Being out all night with Bonham in a port town that Bonham knew was an experience . Two drunken seamen from a freighter that was in , who showed up and as quickly disappeared , were the only white people that they saw . Bonham knew maybe half of the people that they met , and some of them were always coming over to shake hands and offer to buy a drink . He had been to Grand Bank only four times with diving clients , but anybody who met him apparently did not forget him . Being with him was also comforting . Not since his youth in the Navy when he would go on pass with four or five buddies had Grant felt so secure among the pimps and whores , thieves and con-men , brawlers and drunks of a waterfront port town  --  colored or white . Some of the stevedores who worked on the local docks were powerfully built , mean-looking men and all of them were drunk , but nobody bothered Bonham . And clearly nobody was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at whichever table he happened to be , eating more hamburgers and drinking more whiskey , and his dark stormcloud eyes got brighter and more stormy . He was perfectly polite to everyone , but everyone was perfectly polite to him . But even all of this could not keep Grant 's head from dropping lower and lower toward the table as the time wore on . He had not been nearly so drunk either of the other two times he had been drunk today . He had not been nearly so drunk anywhere , for a long time . His nose was almost touching the beerwet Formica tabletop when Bonham staggered over to him from somewhere and said thickly , " Cmon . Lesh get outa thish . " " The spark'sh gone out . There'sh no fire . Shit , it ai nt worth it , " he said when they were outside in the incredibly fresh air . " Whew ! What a drunk ! " The moment he climbed into the little car , though he was drunk , Grant caught a strong whiff of sex in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did get himself laid after all . But then he wondered . It could , in this joint , just as easy have been any other couple , staggering outside to find the first car they could to hump in . He said nothing . Though he was staggering when on his feet , Bonham drove cautiously , very slowly and well . And of course there were absolutely no other vehicles on the long straight road from Georgetown to the hotel . And the marvelous air had sobered and wakened both of them a little bit . " Why do we drink like this ? " Grant croaked suddenly from his side as he ( hilly watched the seaside hotel come into view in the headlights at the end of the straight , flat road .  | Bonham did n't answer for a moment . " Oh , to stand ourselves ; and other people , " he said calmly , and turned the little car carefully into its parking space on the grass . By five-thirty they were in bed asleep . The last thing Grant heard before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The hell with them . I 'm gon na lock the door . Let ' ern go out by themselves tomorrow morning . We 'll go in the afternoon . " As he fell bodily into peaceful drunken sleep , Grant thoroughly agreed . But it was not to happen that way . At ten minutes of eight , they were awakened by an enormously loud pounding on the door of the room . It was Carol Abernathy , and she was cursing them and yelling at the top of her voice for them to get the fuck up in there . Almost automatically , Grant was on his feet and stumbling toward the door in his shorts , his eyes still gummed almost shut and his head feeling like an overripe squash  --  anything to stop that crazy embarrassing screeching . A muffled " What the hell ? " came from Bonham 's sheeted bulk , and he too sat up . " For God 's sake , yes ! " he declared in agreement . " Open the door and let her in and tell her to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already flipped the lock and flung open the door . There was Carol , in a bathing suit and terrycloth robe , and In her right hand  --  rather awkwardly  --  she brandished the eight-inch blade of Grant 's razorsharp diving knife which Bonham had sold him in Canado Bay . It was with the butt of this knife that she had been pounding so incredibly loudly on the door . She advanced with it , swinging it amateurishly before her , slicing widely with it back and forth , and Grant backed away . A glance at the bureau where he had put it last evening showed him the plastic scabbard was still there . She had sneaked in during the night and taken it while they were gone . From the other bed Bonham was staring at him with his eyebrows up and an astonished , disbelieving look on his face . " You lazy no-good sons of bitches ! " Carol Abernathy yelled at them , swinging the knife . Her face was tomato-red . " Drunken bums ! Whoremongers ! You 're going diving whether you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! You think I 'm going to let him do this to you ? " she yelled at Grant . - Faking you out and getting you drunk and fucking nigger wenches ! Just so he wo n't have to take you diving ! How do you know what you could stele ! You 're paying for this shitty trip , and I 'm going to see you get your money 's worth ! You ! " she screamed at Bonham , " get out of that goddam fucking bed ! I mean it ! " She advanced on him , still swinging Grant 's kife.  | Bonham had begun to come awake now . " Here , here , now , " he said sitting with his back against the headboard and looking as if he did n't know whether to laugh or not . Carol Abernathy came right on toward his bed . " You think I wo n't use it ? I 'll slice you to goddam shreds ! " Bonham stared at her . Then suddenly he threw back the sheet and , for a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed on the side away from her . From somewhere within him there emanated a peculiar sound which the still astonished Grant could only describe as a giggle , a bass giggle . As if his retreat proved her moral rightness , Carol Abernathy grinned , a strange tomato-red rictus , and changed her line of advance to come around the bed end . She came on until she was only six feet away from them , and then stopped , still flourishing the knife at the two standing men , Grant in his shorts , Bonham in his pajamas . " Carol ! Carol ! Are you out of your mind ? What the hell are you doing ? " Grant was saying . Either man was well enough trained , well enough experienced , in unarmed combat and brawling that he could have disarmed her with no more than a superficial cut , but neither made a move to do so . Grant had the feeling that it was all an act , a scene perhaps from one of his own plays , it would make a great second-act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair ! " Carol Abernathy screamed at them . " Men ! Men ! You , you nigger bumper ! " she yelled at Grant . " And you , you great lump of degenerate-tinter-She yelled at Bonham . She swung the big knife back and forth in front of her , without even keeping the point directed at them . " I say you 're by God going diving ! And you 're by God going ! If you stay out all night drinking and whoring with nigger cunts , then that 's just the price you have to pay ! But you ! " she screamed at Grant , " you 're going to get your money 's worth out of this shitty trip if I have to slice you up ! " She did not advance further , as if she knew  --  or so Grant thought  --  that to do so would imperil her up to now winning position . Bonham turned his head completely away from her and looked over at Grant . " Well , shit . We 're up . We might as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . " Your fucking goddam well right you 'll go ! " Carol Abernathy yelled , and brandished Grant 's knife . " Mrs Abernathy , " Bonham said in his deepest voice , " if I 'm goin ( living , I got to get dressed . Do n't I ? " He grinned at her with his stormcloud eyes , and shucked out of his pajama jacket which was already unbuttoned any .  | way , then untied the drawstring of the pants . Smiling at her , he let them drop . Carol Abernathy was already almost outside the door . More swiftly than she entered , she retreated , yelling " I 'll be right outside the door ! " in a voice that now held a shrill note of peculiar terror . She shut the door after her . It was something Grant wished he had thought of first . But then , being ? having been  --  her lover , it would n't have made any difference if he had done it . Or would it ? " Fuckincunts ! Goddam fucking cunts ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went about putting on his sloppy tentsized swimming trunks . It was the first time Grant had ever heard him use the big had word . His face resembled a long-suffering thunderstorm that was wanting to break out into lightning and hard hail but never could . Outside the door , when they emerged , Carol Abernathy was still holding the knife . " Okay , march ! " she said . She was no longer screaming . But the contemptuous tone of her voice made them both stop stock-still in their tracks , and she suddenly looked frightened , as if she knew she had gone too far . " Carol , give me that knife , " Grant said , putting into it all the force he had . " Not on your life ! " Carol Abernathy said . " You think I 'm crazy ? Not on your life ! " " 1 could take it away from you if I wanted , " Grant said quietly . " So could he , " and jerked his head at Bonham . " But you 'd get yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carol Abernathy said . " It 's sharp . " She put her thumbnail on the blade like the rank amateur with knives that she was . " Move , I said ! " but her tone had softened considerably . " Mrs Abernathy , " Bonham said , using again his deepest voice . " After yon . " " Ha ! " Carol Abernathy said . " I 'm not turning my back on you . Either one+ of you . " Bonham stared at her for a long contemptuous moment , then turned on his heel and started down the hallway . He did not speak to her again . ( : rant hung back until Bonham was a ways ahead , and then started to follow , Carol right behind him . " What the hell are you doing ? " he said in a low voice . " You 're embarrassing the shit out of me . In front of all these people . They 'll think you 're crazy . " ' ' They can think what they want , " Carol Abernathy said reasonably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll let you spend a fortune on this trip and then not do any skindiving . " " We 're going diving , " Grant said . " Now give me my knife . And go take a nap or something . " " No , sir ! Not on your life , " Carol Abernathy smiled . " I 'm going with you , and I 'm staying right there with you all goddamned day . " Fakaggers ! Fucking dirty niggers ! " she said in a low , intense voice . " How do you know what you got  --  Y'ou could get the syph . " " I did n't fuck anybody : Grant said reasonably and then realized how totally unreasonable everything was . " DO N'T LIE ! " Carol Abernathy thundered . Still walking , half a step in front of her , Grant too looked at her for a long moment and then turned on his heel and walked away . But this deliberate action did not faze her either . She followed both of them , still carrying the knife . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting Orloffskis and Finers had the same benumbed expression Bonham had worn earlier . Carol Abernathy marched right through them  --  and through Bonham and Grant  --  and climbed into the big sixteen-foot diving dinghy and stationed herself in the very forepeak of the bow , and there she stayed with Grant 's knife . " Well , come on ! " she called raucously . " Let 's get this show on the road ! " But it was at that exact moment when her self-appointed role began to fail . Whether it was the presence of Cathie Finer whom she had taken such a liking to , or whether it was something else , Grant did not know . Whatever it was , her emotional oneness began to shrink , visibly . And with it , she herself seemed to shrink physically , shrink up into herself as if she were putting her arms around herself and curling up into a foetal ball , a foetal selfpity . " Come on , get in ! " Bonham said to the others shortly and savagely . " Well , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shut up ! " Bonham said . " Just shut up , and get in , will you ? " The two women took the crossboard seat nearest Carol , Orloffski and Finer the middle one , and Grant and Bonham climbed into the stern . " How are you today , Carol ? " Cathie Finer said sweetly . Wanda Lou , for once , was saying nothing . " Oh , I 'm all right , " Carol Abernathy said . " Only I did n't get much sleep last night with these two drunks coming in and hollering and yelling at all hours . "  | ' It 's a lovely day today , is n't it ? " Cathie Finer said . Carol Abernathy looked around . " Yes , it is , " she said and suddenly looked as if she was going to weep . She smiled tremulously at Cathie .
