When the fighting against the Congolese rebels tailed off six months ago , Premier Moise Tshombe knew the war was not fully won . His troops had never dared attack the Simbas ' mountain redoubt of Fizi , located high above Lake Tanganyika and reachable only by roads so narrow and precipitous that they are impassable during rainstorms . Led by Castro Cuban advisers and supplied with Red Chinese arms ferried in from Tanzania to the lake port of Baraka , the 5,500-man ragtag rebel force was roaming at will through a 200-sq. - mi. patch of the eastern Congo , cutting roads , murdering and terrorizing the population . Tshombe knew the Simbas had to be driven out of Fizi , and to do the job he once again called on his favorite gun-for-hire , Mercenary Commander Mike Hoare . <P> <P> Fortnight ago , everything was ready . Hoare 's plan was to send a diversionary column of 100 mercenaries under Major Alastair Wicks up the road from Albertville in the south while his main assault force-160 men-stormed ashore from an " invasion fleet " composed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barges and five patrol boats . His code name for the mission was " Operation Banzai . " <P> Blinking Lights . Long before dawn one moonless morning , an advance patrol of seven heavily armed commandos , their faces blackened with burnt cork , landed on a rocky beach north of Baraka . Soon their signal lights began blinking the all-clear , and a patrol boat churned in with the first assault wave of ten men . Before they had waded all the way ashore , however , a cross fire of tracers arced down at them from machine-gun nests in the bluff beyond , forcing the mercenaries to take cover behind their boat . <P> The second wave had better luck . Landing 200 yds. to the north , its ten commandos managed to scramble across the beach and up the bluff . They walked straight into an enemy village . Chickens scurried out of their way and goats stared at them in surprise , but the village was otherwise deserted . Luckily for the mercenaries , the Simbas had been called elsewhere . Down the road , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing at the beach . The commando lieutenant sent a patrol to silence it , then set fire to a cluster of thatched huts as a signal to Hoare to send more men . The huts exploded : the rebels had hidden grenades and ammunition under their roofs . <P> Stalled Column . From there it was only four miles to Baraka , but hardly had Hoare 's men moved out than their charge began to stall . On the outskirts of town , two battalions of Simbas rained mortar , bazooka and machine-gun fire on the commandos . A spearhead led by Hoare 's two armored cars finally broke through , but it was two long days before he was in firm control of Baraka , and then only after most of the town had been destroyed . Death toll : five commandos , 215 Simbas . <P> Never before had Hoare been met by such determined opposition , and the battle for Fizi had hardly begun . For the first time in his career as mercenary commander , he was forced to halt his drive and change his battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the south , he ordered it into boats for a water trip to join him in Baraka . Then Hoare and his officers sat down to try to figure out how to negotiate the 23-mile mountain road to the rebel stronghold itself .
