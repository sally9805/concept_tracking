If ever a horse earned the right to a luxurious retirement , it was Kelso . Last November , following a spectacular six-year career in which the gelding was five times voted Horse of the Year , won 36 races and $1,893,362-more money than any other thoroughbred in history- " Kelly " quit racing . Owner Allaire du Pont sent him to her Aiken , S.C. , farm , gave him a stall with a view , a few hundred acres of pasture all to himself , and a personal groom to look after his every need . He had his own water supply ( Vichy , imported from Arkansas ) , his own special sugar-cane mattress , even his own mailbox-an outsize affair that was designed to accommodate the 3,000 letters that arrive each week from sentimental fans . <P> This season Kelso 's retirement seemed to Trainer Carl Hanford a little premature . After all , there has not been another horse worth snorting at . Gun Bow , Kelso 's chief protagonist in 1964 , has managed to win only three out of eight races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far this year is a converted sprinter named Pia Star , who never won a race longer than seven furlongs until last month . <P> That was enough for Trainer Hanford . " Kelso , " he announced , " is happier when active . " Strictly for exercise , he entered the eight-year-old in a six-furlong allowance race at New Jersey 's Monmouth Park . " He wo n't even know what six furlongs is . " Maybe not , but Kelso still ran third , beaten less than a length for all the money after he stumbled coming out of the starting gate and nearly threw his jockey . <P> Next stop was Delaware Park and last week 's Diamond State Handicap . The distance ( 1 1/16 miles ) was more to Kelso 's liking , and so was the purse : $20,000 added . Seventeen horses had been nominated in the stakes event at $50 a head . The price of a stall in the starting gate was an extra $250 . And when 13 owners saw Kelso on the list , they figured that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a wise decision . When Kelso showed up at Delaware Park , he was so keyed up that Owner du Pont tied a silver mink " cribbing collar " around his muzzle-to keep him from biting anyone or anything in sight . <P> At post time , the odds were 3-10 , and track officials canceled all show betting on the race . What race ? Kelso galloped easily to a 31-length victory , missed the track record for 1 1/16 mi. by just 3/5 sec . The victory swelled his income by $14,202 and settled the question of his retirement once and for all . " Kelso will keep running as long as he can beat good horses , " said Trainer Hanford . And how long would that be ? " Oh , a couple of years or so . "
