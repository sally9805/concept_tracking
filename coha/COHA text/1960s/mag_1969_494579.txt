After Haynsworth The Supreme Court has been one Justice short since last spring , and will remain so at least through January . Having expressed regret that the Senate rejected his nomination of Judge Clement F. Haynsworth , Jr. , the President let it be known that he would not send up another name before mid-January , after the second session of this Congress has convened . The delay is inevitable . The Senate is deep in the tax bill just now . It could scarcely find time before Christmas for the hearing and floor action that are necessary even on the least controversial of nominees . In rejecting him by a more decisive margin than anyone had expected ( 55 to 45 ) , the Senate did not disgrace , and hence did not victimize , Judge Hayns ' - worth . It merely assured the people that nominees for the Supreme Court will be held to the highest ethical standards , higher even than at least one present member of the Court has in the past lived by . The present member of the Court whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice Douglas , who has maintained extra-judicial connections , chiefly with foundations . Since the point of the Haynsworth case was not so much that Judge Haynsworth failed to disqualify himself in certain cases , but that he engaged in activities that gave rise to his disqualification problems , a Senate that rejected his nomination would be hard put now to confirm Justice Douglas . But no one would dream of trying to impeach Judge Haynsworth , or of otherwise driving him off the bench , for no culpable transgressions are in question . On the basis of what is now known , any move to impeach Justice Douglas would be similarly uncalled for . Representative Gerald Ford of Michigan , the Republican minority leader in the House , says he is conducting an investigation of Justice Douglas with a view to possible impeachment proceedings . Assuming that Mr. Ford uncovers nothing new , his only responsible course is to withdraw the threat , and soon . Black Homeowning Chicago In the slab-like Federal Building , two courtrooms down the hall from the Conspiracy Seven , a pair of quietly spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related cases , engineered by a community organization called the Contract Buyers League , mark the awakening of the black homebuyer and may signal long-term relief from his predicament . In a class action , some 3500 home purchasers have sued 25o speculators , realtors , banks , savings and loan associations , insurance companies and , builders , claiming that Chicago 's Jim Crow housing market impelled them to pay exorbitant prices for their homes . They ask the court to put the differences between what they paid and what the homes were actually worth at time of purchase back into the black pocket . Most of the plaintiffs come from the West Side 's Lawndale section , which 15 years ago was a cohesive , comfortable way station for lace-curtain Irish and Jews enroute to the suburbs . But as blacks pushed into the area in the late fifties and sixties Lawndale came apart . Its disintegration was accelerated by block-busting and feverish speculation . Densely populated and overwhelmingly black , , Lawndale now is among the most dismal of Chicago 's ghettoes . Joseph Nowicki , a seasoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , estimates that 6o percent of the buildings in the area are beyond repair and must be demolished . A major motif of this West Side story is the land installment contract ? a hybrid of a mortgage and a lease . While the area was in transition , speculators gobbled up one- and two-family houses from Negro-shy whites at panic prices , mortgaged the buildings with cooperative savings and loan associations , and quickly resold the properties on land contract to blacks . Land contracts are common to most states , but in Illinois they leave the unsophisticated buyer peculiarly defenseless before the law . The buyer neither builds equity in the property , nor assumes title , until he has competely paid off the contract . Under Illinois law , if he misses one monthly payment he can be stripped of his entire investment and evicted from the house within 45 days of the default . A homebuyer with mortgage financing , in contrast , is frequently accorded two years to catch up a default , or can leave the house with part of his initial investment in hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought a home in Lawndale in 1961 . Collins works as a janitor and mechanic , makes his contract payments without fail , and manicures his property . He purchased his two-flat building on contract for $25,000 . According to public records , a speculator had bought the property for $14,000 three days prior to reselling it . He put $2.0oo down and obtained a mortgage for $12,000 . The speculator got a $1500 down payment from Collins , plus the promise of monthly payments of $190 for 19 years to cover amortization and interest charges of seven percent . His net investment was then $500 . Yet under the contract , the speculator stands to receive a total of $44,820 , including $19,820 in interest , from the Collinses . Had the Collinses been able to obtain an FHA insured mortgage ? which they could not because FHA refused to insure in the ghetto until mid-1967 ? their total cash outlay on the house would have run about $21,000 . A recent $15,000 appraisal on the property qualifies them for a mortgage up to 97 percent of that amount . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a fair price of $15,000 , and obtain an FHA mortgage with a $1500 down payment and monthly payments of $190 , their interest costs would have totalled only about $6000 . Contract sellers argue that their prices were warranted by the poor credit standing of most black buyers . " I would say that 's a lot of rot , " snaps Bernard Koenig , a lawyer who has been practicing on the West Side for 20 years . " What they did was say if he 's black , we 've got him . They never even bothered to get a credit check on the buyers before executing the contract . " The speculators ' profits were cut from the whole cloth of racist policies . Suburban developers , for example , by excluding blacks from their housing projects , have aggravated the overload of black home-buyers in a limited housing market . Major banks withdrew mortgage financing from the West Side as the black population swelled : Negro buyers were thrown into the clutches of the speculators . Smaller savings and loan associations ? one of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? refused loans to black homebuyers , yet provided speculators with generous financing . Julian Levi of the University of Chicago Law School , and student of the contract market , comments , " The savings and loan institutions bear a large share of the blame for this Lawndale situation . They knew that they were making loans on properties to be resold to Negroes at a much higher price than they were ' bought for . " Among the silent partners in the unmaking of Lawn-dale have been the Veterans Administration ? which according to the Contract Buyers League often refused mortgage insurance to black veterans buying in the area ? and the FHA . Until the summer of 1967 , FHA used its " economic soundness " ' requirement and its policy of " red-lining " racially changing neighborhoods to cut the ghetto off from mortgage insurance . " When the neighborhood started to change , " says a repentent contract seller who has brokered real estate in Lawn-dale for 25 years , " the FHA rejected applications for mortgage insurance out of hand . It would n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could sell a house was on contract . There 's not a doubt that FHA was completely derelict in its duties . " Civil rights lawyers regard the CBL suits ? Baker vs . F &F; Investment Co. and Clark vs . Universal Builders Inc. ? with delight and astonishment . If the suits are successful , they may breathe life into the long dormant Civil Rights Act of 1866 , which established that blacks have the same right to purchase , hold and convey real estate as whites . Last year the Supreme Court in Jones vs . Mayer used the 1866 law to bar racial discrimination in private home sales . The CBL suits argue that that Act also prohibits price exploitation growing out of discriminatory practices . In a pretrial opinion , Judge Hubert Will conceded that the novel CBL slant on the law means " that every nonwhite citizen has a cause of action maintainable in Federal Court to either rescind or reform each and every transaction involving a purchase or leasing of either real or personal property by the simple allegation that he was charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable terms and conditions than would have been given to a white person . " Though CBL lawsuits may be fine cutting tools for exploited black homebuyers and black consumers in general , they cut exceedingly slowly through the judicial process . CBL 's attorneys predict that the cases will not be resolved before the mid-seventies , because of massive pretrial investigating work and the probability of extensive appeals . Yet time is crucial to the buyers . " Most of our people are paying between 35 and 45 percent of their income for housing , " Charlie Baker , chairman of CBL , says . " That 's way above the 25 percent level that the housing act the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 says low-income people should be paying on mortgages . Now tell me , am I right or am I wrong , that it is n't fair for these people to have to keep paying these heavy notes for four or five years longer when everybody knows we 've been cheated ? " To relieve the immediate pressure of the house payments , CBL initiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying to an escrow fund rather than to the seller . Most of these families are at some stage of the eviction process . Thirty-two of them have received eviction writs and can be put out on the streets anytime Sheriff Joe Woods gets around to it . The CBL has undertaken another round of legal battles in both state and federal courts against the Illinois eviction laws , as a tactic to stall pending evictions and prevent new ones . In November it filed a federal suit challenging the constitutionality of the Forcible Entry and Detainer Act , which prescribes eviction procedures against contract buyers . " The law does n't work for us in the evictions , " Baker says . " The judge wo n't even listen to anything the buyer has got to ? say . All the judge is going to do is give you five days to raise a big appeal bond that you do n't have the money for and give you so many days to get out of the house . " A successful payment strike would probably force the contract sellers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected in the federal courts . The CBL estimates the potential return to all DECEMBER 13 , 1969 contract buyers involved in the federal cases at about $6o million in cash and paper . But if the courts reject their challenge to the Illinois eviction law and permit a raft of evictions , the buyers will be out of home and out of pocket . " We are fighting as hard as we can , " Baker declares , " for the right to stay at home and keep ourselves off the streets . " Alan Boles Ribicoff vs. the Army Senator Ribicoff became convinced early this year that there was something rotten in Southeast Asia . Something in the climate , or the nature of man , was making American soldiers as corrupt as South Vietnamese politicians . Since he needed hard evidence , Ribicoff sent his man Carmine Bellino and a team of investigators to Saigon to pick up what they could . They returned , after several months to empty their bags of dirt . It took them and assorted other witnesses 15 days to sift through it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairmanship Ribicoff had on loan from Senator McClellan . As Ribicoff hinted at the outset , it was a mixed bag of allegations of theft and misuse of money spent by soldiers in service clubs in Vietnam and elsewhere , kickbacks from entertainers booked by the clubs , petty illegal traffic in weapons , and black market currency manipulation . Corruption was the common ingredient and the " defendants " included not only a relatively small number of men specifically charged with crimes , but the US Army itself , whose offense was covering up for them . TV cameras were allowed in as observers , and that enraged civil libertarians , who wondered if it was proper for the subcommittee in effect to put men on public trial without customary courtroom protections like the right to cross-examine witnesses , protest questions , and call witnesses of their own . Ribicoff answered that he was acting only because the Army itself had n't . Besides , he said , it was the job of the Government Operations Committee ( of which Investigations is an offshoot ) to look into such matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another argument for a hasty liquidation of the war : not only is the United States powerless or disinclined to deal with the corrupt acts of its allies in Saigon ; the US is a victim by contagion . Four sergeants who had known each other for years and who had arranged to get similar assignments in the US , Germany and finally in South Vietnam , incorporated themselves as a sales agent or middleman to arrange the buying of food and other supplies for 9 army service clubs . To do business with the clubs , a . company had to pay a kickback to the conspiring sergeants ; entertainers who wanted bookings to appear in service clubs also paid kickbacks . Receipts from slot machines were skimmed ; a percentage of the take went into the pockets of the club managers . The victims of the assorted swindles were the servicemen who patronized the clubs and whose money financed club . operations . The four sergeants ? William Wooldridge , Seymour Lazar , William Higdon and Narvaez Hatcher ? acted as sales agent to the clubs , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hatcher . The corporation , Maredem ( named after Marion Hatcher , Edith Higdon and Emilie Lazar ) contacted food and other suppliers to the clubs and told them that if they wanted to do further business with the clubs they would have to transact it through Maredem , sharing profits and paying a commission for the privilege . Maredem 's business amounted to $3 million to $4 million annually ; the corporation returned a profit of $250 thousand on the first million it took in . At one point Sgt. Higdon , as manager of one service club , signed a $13,000 check made out to Maredem , out of club funds in payment for a 20-ton walk-in freezer . Maredem did not own the freezer but had stolen it from the first infantry division , which had paid only $9,000 for it in the first place . Before Ribicoff got into this cesspool , the Army had begun and then abandoned an inquiry of its own . It was abandoned , it is said , because disclosures would reflect badly on the general under whom served the most prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlisted man in the US Army . ( When the scandal finally broke he was deprived of his Distinguished Service Medal . The army said he did n't deserve it . ) Wooldridge had a kind of immunity that resulted from his associations with Gen. Carl C. ( Peewee ) Turner , once provost marshal of the army ( in charge of 25,000 military police ) and more recently ( but only briefly ) chief of US marshals . His tenure was shortened when Defense Secretary Laird got the Justice Department to force his resignation in anticipation of his notoriety . Turner 's own penchant for guns made him the central figure in the second round of Ribicoff 's hearings . His misdeed : obtaining confiscated guns from the Chicago police department supposedly for use in military training , but actually for resale and personal . profit . It is a pity that all this could n't be dealt with in the courts or in military court-martial proceedings , for there is no way to discern whether the hectic , disorganized , and confusing treatment it got from the Senate subcommittee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurately affixed guilt .
