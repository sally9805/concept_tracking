Faced with a rising tide of criticism , Prime Minister Lai Bahadur Shastri decided that he needed to get away from his desk for some hard political barn storming . Last week he flew to Calcutta to make his first public appearance outside New Delhi since he took office . <P> No city needed his attention more than Calcutta ( pop . 3,000,000 ) , the steaming factory and port of eastern India . The city 's labor force was in an ugly mood : some 3,000 civil servants had been on strike for higher bonus payments , and the leftist labor unions were hotly agitating for a general work stoppage . <P> Bare Feet . Shastri , who had spent most of the 2-hour flight with his bare feet propped up on a metal dispatch case as he perused official papers , landed almost on the run . After brief airport ceremonies , he dashed off to a locomotive factory to ask the workers to ignore the general strike and keep the factory open , " whatever happens . " Their loudly chorused reply : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd-lined streets , he headed downtown for conferences with local Congress Party leaders , after which he appeared on the Maidan , a big , grassy plain in the heart of Calcutta , to give a crowd of 350,000 an opportunity for darshana - a sort of blessed contact through sight - and , more important , a major political speech plugging his own new brand of neutralism for India . <P> In his flat , reedy voice , the little Premier told the cheering crowd that this month 's harvest and massive new U.S. grain shipments would end the worst part of the food crisis within four weeks . Aware that accepting such increased aid from the U.S. had exposed him to leftist criticism , Shastri hotly insisted that he was remaining on the path of the late beloved Jawaharlal Nehru - whose " nonaligned " posture did not prevent him from taking healthy doses of help from the West . As for his Communist attackers , he said they think " in terms of destruction and not construction " and have to " wait for instructions from outside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deal . To prove the government 's continued dedication to neutralism , Defense Minister Y. B. Chavan stood up in Parliament last week to announce details of a new $210 million arms deal with Moscow for three squadrons of MIG-21 supersonic jet fighters , plus an assortment of other military hardware and help in building a complete MIG assembly plant . And Shastri himself was preparing to leave the Indian subcontinent for the first time in his life , to fly to Cairo for next week 's meeting of the nonaligned bloc in which Nehru had been such a towering figure .
