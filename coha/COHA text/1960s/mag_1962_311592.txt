The funnies , those staples of the daily press , were invented some 60 years ago to make people laugh-or at least chuckle . But where are the pratfalls , " Pows ! " and " Kerflooies ! " of yesteryear ? Some comic-strip artists , recalling a simpler era , still let their cartoon creatures play it for laughs . But a growing number of characters in the funnies are much too busy for such nonsense . They are earnestly fighting the cold war . <P> Some of the characters are old hands at the game . Milton Caniff 's Steve Canyon made his first foray against the Reds in 1947 . George Wunder 's Terry , like Canyon a U.S. Air Force pilot , is as good at outmaneuvering the Russian and Chinese Communists as he ever was against the China-coast pirates of the 1930s . Navy Commander Buz Sawyer has just set forth on a mission against the international dope trade-or , as Sawyer 's creator . Artist Roy Crane , put it , " the sinister machinations of a World Power . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field . Joe Palooka , showing no effects of his 31 years as world heavyweight champion , recently outwitted the Reds to rescue a U.S. scientist in Austria . Smilin ' Jack , the aerial barnstormer , smiles no more-he is doing his level best to keep the Russians from sabotaging the U.S. space effort . Winnie Winkle went to Moscow as a fashionable emissary of the U.S. Department of Commerce ; alas , she wound up in the Russian pokey steaming away time in the laundry on trumped-up charges of espionage . <P> " Ray Gimmick . " Of all the funny-paper freedom fighters , none is more dogged than Harold L. Gray 's 38-year-old Orphan Annie , a mop-haired moppet who has empty circles for eyes* and a bald , dinner-jacketed billionaire for a foster father . Last month , Annie and her Daddy Warbucks were holed up on a tropical island somewhere just off the map . Suddenly " enemy " planes appeared , carrying H-bombs . But Daddy and his pals were forearmed . Using what he calls his " ray gimmick , " Daddy exploded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's previous adventure showed the U.S. how to handle Castro . A passenger on an airliner " sky-jacked " by unshaven pirates . Annie was taken to the island of Tributo , where General Mustashio Toro held her and her fellow hostages for $30 million ransom . But one of Daddy 's aides hanged the General and herded Annie and company through a secret passageway to the Warbucks yacht . There , Daddy declaimed the moral : " I recall Teddy Roosevelt 's advice ! ' Never shake your fist and then shake your finger ! That is the sort of Americanism I think an awful lot of us admire !
