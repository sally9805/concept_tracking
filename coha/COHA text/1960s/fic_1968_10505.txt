AIRPORT an aircraft parking ramp outside . As he left the shelter of the termi- nal , wind and whirling snow slammed savagely against the car 's windshield . The wiper blades slapped swiftly back and forth , though barely maintaining sufficient clear space for forward vision . Through a fractionally opened window , a blast of icy air and snow rushed in . Mel closed the window hastily . The transition from the terminal 's warm snugness to the harshness of the night outside was startling . Immediately ahead were airplanes parked at gate positions on the ramp . Through breaks in the snow , as the wind whipped and eddied around concourse buildings , Mel could see into the lighted interiors of several aircraft , which had passengers already seated . Obviously , several flights were ready to leave . These would be awaiting word from the tower to start engines , their continued delay a result of the blockage of runway three zero . Farther out on the airfield and runways , he could make out blurred shapes and naviga- don lights of other airplanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a holding area , which pilots called the penalty box , and would move in as gate positions became vacant . Undoubtedly , the same thing was happening in the other seven aircraft concourses grouped around the terminal . The two-way radio in Mel 's car , tuned to ground control fre- quency , crackled alive . " Tower to Eastern seventeen , " a controller intoned , " you are cleared to runway two five . Change frequency now for your air- ways clearance . " A burst of static . " Eastern seventeen . Roger . " A stronger voice rasped irritably . " Ground control from Pan Am fifty-four on outer taxiway to two five . There 's a private Cessna in front  --  a twin-engine tortoise . I 'm standing on my brakes to keep behind . " " Pan Am fifty-four , stand by . " The briefest pause , then the con- troller 's voice again : " Cessna seven three metro from ground control . Enter the next right intersection , hold , and let Pan American pass you . " Unexpectedly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trol from Cessna seven three metro . I 'm turning now . Go ahead , Pan Am , you great big bully . " A chuckle , then , " Thanks , honey . You can fix your lipstick while you wait . " The controller 's voice rebuked , " Tower to all aircraft . Confine your messages to official business . " The controller was edgy , Mel could tell , despite the routine , studied calmness . But who would n't be tonight , with conditions and traffic the way they were ? He thought uneasily again about his brother , Keith , involved with the unrelenting pressure of west arrivalcontrol . The talk between tower and aircraft was continuous , with no gaps between transmissions . When one exchange ended , Mel snapped his own mike button down . " Ground control from mobile one . I 'm at gate sixty-five , proceeding to runway three zero , site of the stuck707 . " He listened while the controller gave taxiing instructions to two other flights which had just landed . Then : " Tower to mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the gate ahead of you . Hold short of runway two one . " Mel acknowledged . He could see the Air Canada flight , at this moment easing out from a terminal gate , its high graceful tail an angular silhouette . While still in the ramp area , he drove out toward the airfield carefully , watching for ramp lice  --  as airport men called the proliferation of vehicles which surrounded airplanes on the ground . As well as the usual ones , tonight there were several cherry pickers  --  trucks with high , maneuverable platforms at the end of steel , articulated arms . On the platforms , service crews were reaching out to clear snow from aircraft wings , and spraying glycol to retard ice formation . The men themselves were snow-covered in their exposed position . Mel braked hastily , avoiding a speeding honey wagon , on its way from the ramp area to disgorge its malodorous four-hundred gallon load of contents pumped out from aircraft toilets . The load would eject into a shredding machine in a special building which other airport employees avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times the procedure worked efficiently , except when passengers reportedlosses of items  --  dentures , purses , wallets , even shoes  --  dropped accidentally in aircraft toilets . It happened once or twice a day . Then loads had to be sifted , while everyone hoped the missing item could be located quickly . Even without incidents , Mel realized , this would be a busy night for sanitary crews . Airport managements knew from experience that42 AIRPORTdemands on toilet facilities , on the ground and in the air , increased as weather worsened . Mel wondered how many people were aware that airport sanitary supervisors received hourly weather forecasts and made their plans  --  for extra cleaning and increased supplies  --  accordingly . The Air Canada jet he was to follow had cleared the terminal and was increasing taxi speed . Mel accelerated to keep up . It was reassuring  --  with windshield wipers barely coping with the snow  --  to have the DC-9 's taillight as a reference point ahead . Through the rear mirror he could make out the shape of another , larger jet now following . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France four-o-four , there is an airport ground vehicle between you and Air Canada . " It took a quarter of an hour to reach the intersection where runway three zero was blocked by the Aereo-Mexican 707 . Before then , Mel had separated from the stream of taxiing aircraft which were destined for takeoff on the two other active runways . He stopped the car and got out . In the dark and loneliness out here , the storm seemed even more wintry and violent than nearer the terminal . The wind howled across the deserted runway . If wolves appeared tonight , Mel thought , it would not be surprising . A shadowy figure hailed him . " Is that Mr. Patroni ? " " No , it is n't . " Mel found that he , too , had to shout to make himself heard above the wind . " But Joe Patroni 's on the way . " The other man came closer . He was huddled into a parka , his face blue with cold . " When he gets here , we 'll be glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what Patroni 'll do . We 've tried about everything to get this bastard out . " He gestured to the airplanelooming , shadowy , behind them . " She 's stuck , but good . " Mel identified himself , then asked , " Who are you ? " " Ingram , sir . Aereo-Mexican maintenance foreman . Right now , I wish I had some other job . " As the two men talked , they moved nearer to the stalled Boeing 707 , instinctively seeking shelter under the wings and fuselage , high above them . Under the big jet 's belly , a red hazard light winked rhythmically . In its reflection Mel could see the mud beneath snow in which the aircraft 's wheels were deeply mired . On the runway and adjoining taxiway , clustered like anxious relatives , were a profusionof trucks and service vehicles , including a fuel tanker , bag-AIRPORT 43gage tenders , a post office van , two crew buses , and a roaring power cart . Mel pulled the collar of his topcoat tightly around him . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done so far ? " In the past two hours , Ingram reported , old-fashioned boarding ramps had been trundled from the terminal , manhandled to the aircraft , and passengers guided down them . It had been a slow , tricky job because steps were icing as fast as they were cleared . An elderly woman had been carried down by two mechanics . Babies were passed from hand to hand in blankets . Now , all passengers were gone  --  in buses , along with the stewardesses and the second officer . The captain and first officer remained . " Since the passengers left  --  have you tried to get the airplane moving ? " The foreman nodded affirmatively . " Had the engines running twice . The captain 's put on all the power he dare . But she wo n't come free . Just seems to dig herself in deeper . " " What 's happening now ? " " We 're taking off more weight , hoping that 'll help . " Most of the fuel , Ingram added , had been sucked out by tankers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Baggage and freight compartments in the belly had been emptied . A post office truck was retrieving mailbags . Mel nodded . The mail , he knew , would have come off anyway . The airport post office kept a minute-to-minute watch on airlineschedules . They knew exactly where their mailbags were and , if delays occurred , postal employees quickly switched mail from one airline to another . Mail from the stranded jet , in fact , would fare better than passengers . In half an hour at most , it would be on its way by another flight , if necessary on an alternate route . Mel asked , " Have you all the help you need ? " " Yes , sir  --  for all we can do now . I 've got most of our crew from Aereo-Mexican here  --  a dozen men . Right now , half of ' em are thawingout in one of the buses . Patroni may want more people , depending on what his ideas are . " Ingram turned , surveying the silent aircraft gloomily . " But if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job , and we 'll need heavy cranes , jacks , and maybe pneumatic bags to lift the wings . For most of those , we 'd have to wait until daylight . The whole thing could take most of tomorrow . " 44 AIRPORT AIRPORT 45Mel said sharply , " It ca n't take most of tomorrow , or even tonight . This runway has to be cleared . . . " He stopped abruptly , shivering with a suddenness which startled him . The intensity was unexpected , almost eerie . Mel shivered again . What was it ? He assured himself : the weather  --  the fierce , harsh wind across the airport , driving the whirling snow . Yet , strangely , since leaving the car until this moment , his body had adjusted to the cold . From the opposite side of the airfield , above the wind , he could hear the thunder of jet engines . They rose to a crescendo , then diminished as a flight took off . Another followed , and another . Over there , all was well . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for the briefest instant he had had a premonition . A hint , no more ; an intuition ; the smell of greater trouble brewing . He should ignore it , of course ; impulse , premonitions , had no place in pragmatic management . Except that once , long ago , he had had the selfsame feeling  --  a conviction of events accumulating , and progressing to some disastrous , unenvisaged end . Mel remembered the end , which he had been unable to avert .. . entirely . He glanced at the 707 again . It was snow-covered now , its outline blurring . Commonsense told him : apart from the runway blockage and the inconvenience of takeoffs over Meadowood , the situation was harmless . There had been a mishap , with no injuries , no apparentdamage . Nothing more . " Let 's go to my car , " he told the Aereo-Mexican foreman . " We 'll get on the radio and find out what 's happening . " On the way , he reminded himself that Cindy would shortly be waiting impatiently downtown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the car it was comfortingly warm . Ingram grunted appreciatively . He loosened his coat and bent forward to hold his hands in the stream of warm air . Mel switched the radio to the frequency of airport maintenance . " Mobile one to Snow Desk . Danny , I 'm at the blocked intersection of three zero . Call TWA maintenance and check on Joe Patroni . Where is he ? When coming ? Over . " Danny Farrow 's voice crisped back through the speaker on the dash . " Snow Desk to mobile one . Wilco . And , Mel , your wife called . " Mel pressed the mike button . " Did she leave a number ? " " Affirmative . " " Mobile one to Snow Desk . Please call her , Danny . Tell her I 'm sorry , I 'll be a little late . But check on Patroni first . " " Understood . Stand by . " The radio went silent . Mel reached inside his topcoat for a pack of Marlboros . He offered them to Ingram . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slap back and forth . Ingram nodded toward the lighted cockpit of the Aereo-Mexican jet . " Up there , that son-of-a-bitch of a captain is probably crying into his sombrero . Next time , he 'll watch blue taxi lights like they was altar candles . Mel asked , " Are your ground crews Mexicans or American ? " " We 're all American . Only meatheads like us would work inthis lousy weather . Know where that flight was going ? " Mel shook his head . " Acapulco . Before this happened , I 'd have given up six months ' screwing to be on it . " The foreman chuckled . " Can you imagine , though  --  getting aboard , and your ass all settled , then having to get off in this . You should have heard the passengers cursing , especially the women . I learned some new words tonight . " The radio came alive again . " Snow Desk to mobile one , " Danny Farrow said . " I talked with TWA about Joe Patroni . They 've heard from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be another hour , at least . He sent a message . You read me so far ? " " We read , " Mel said . " Let 's have the message . " " Patroni warns not to get the airplane deeper in the mud than it is already . Says it can happen easily . So , unless the Aereo-Mexican crowd are real sure of what they 're doing , they should hold off any more tries until Joe gets there . " Mel glanced sideways at Ingram . " How does the Aereo-Mexican crowd feel about that ? " The foreman nodded . " Patroni can have all the tries he wants . We 'll wait . " Danny Farrow said , " Did you get that ? Is it clear ? " AIRPORT 47having little trouble negotiating local streets , which had been recentlyplowed . Snow was still falling heavily , abetted by a strong wind , but the fresh covering on the ground was not yet deep enough to make conditions difficult . Demerest 's destination was a group of three-story apartment blocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Stewardess Row . It was here that many of the stewardesses based at Lincoln International  --  from all airlines  --  maintained apartments . Each apartment was usually shared by two or three girls , and the initiated also had a name for the individual menages . They were known as stewardess nests . The nests were often the scene of lively , off-duty parties , and sometimes headquarters for the amorous affairs which occurred , with predictable regularity , between stewardesses and male flying crews . Taken as a whole , the stewardess nests were neither more nor less freewheeling than other apartments occupied by single girls elsewhere . The difference was that most of what transpired in the way of swinging , amoral activities , involved airline personnel . There was good reason for this . Both the stewardesses and male crew members whom they met  --  captains , and first and second officers  --  were , without exception , high-caliber people . All had reached their jobs , which many others coveted , through a tough , exacting process of elimination in which those less talented were totally eclipsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best . The result was a broth of sharp , enlightened personalities with a zest for life and the perceptiveness to appreciate one another . Vernon Demerest , in his time , had appreciated many stewardesses , as they had appreciated him . He had , in fact , had a succession of affairs with beautiful and intelligent young women whom a monarchor a male movie idol might well have desired without attaining . The stewardesses whom Demerest and fellow pilots knew , and regularlymade love to , were neither whores nor easy lays . They were , however , alive , responsive , and sexually endowed girls , who valued quality , and took it when so obviously and conveniently close to hand . One who had taken it  --  so to speak  --  from Vernon Demerest , and seemed inclined to continue to , was a vivacious , attractive , Englishbornbrunette , Gwen Meighen . She was a farmer 's daughter who had left home to come to the United States ten years earlier at46 AIRPORTMel thumbed the mike button . " It 's clear . " " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra ground crew to help . And , Mel , your wife phoned again . I gave her your message . " Mel sensed Danny hesitating , aware that others whose radios were on the airport maintenance frequency were listening , too . Mel said , " She was n't happy ? " " I guess not . " There was a second 's silence . " You 'd better get to a phone when you can . " It was a safe bet , Mel thought , that Cindy had been more than usually snippy with Danny , but , loyally , he was n't saying so . As for the Aereo-Mexican 707 , obviously there was nothing more to be done until Joe Patroni arrived . Patroni 's advice about not getting the aircraft more deeply mired made good sense . Ingram was pulling on heavy mitts and refastening his coat . " Thanks for the warm-up . " He went out , into the wind and snow , slamming the door quickly . A few moments later , Mel could see him plodding through deep drifts toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snow Desk was speaking to Maintenance Snow Center . Mel waited until the exchange finished , then held the transmit button down . " This is mobile one , Danny . I 'm going to the Conga Line . " He eased the car forward , picking his way carefully in the blowing snow and darkness , with only widely spaced runway lights to guide him . The Conga Line , both spearhead and prime mover of the airport snow-fighting system , was  --  at the moment  --  on runway one seven , left . In a few minutes , Mel thought grimly , he would find out for himself if there was truth , or merely malice , in the critical report of Captain Demerest 's Airlines Snow Committee. 6The subject of Mel 's thoughts  --  Captain Vernon Demerest of Trans America  --  was , at the moment , some three miles from the airport . He was driving his Mercedes 23o SL Roadster and , compared with the journey he had made to the airport earlier from home , was48 AIRPORTthe age of eighteen . Before joining Trans America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of her varied background , she combined an uninhibited sexuality in bed with elegance and style when out of it . It was to Gwen Meighen 's apartment that Vernon Demerest was headed now . Later tonight , the two of them would leave for Rome on Trans America Flight Two . On the flight deck , Captain Demerest would command . In the passenger cabins , aft , Gwen Meighen would be senior stewardess . At the Rome end of the journey , there would be a three-day layover for the crew , while another crew  --  already in Italy for its own layover  --  would fly the airplane back to Lincoln International . The word " layover " had long ago been adopted officially by airlinesand was used deadpan . Possibly , whoever coined the term had a sense of humor ; in any case , flying crews frequently gave it a practical application as well as its official one . Demerest and Gwen Meighen were planning a personal definition now . On arrival in Rome , they would leave immediately for Naples for a forty-eighthour " layover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Vernon Demerest smiled appreciatively at the thought of it . He was nearing Stewardess Row , and as he reminded himself of how well other things had gone this evening , his smile broadened . He had arrived at the airport early , after leaving Sarah , his wife , who  --  placidly as usual  --  had wished him a pleasant trip . In an earlier age , Sarah might have busied herself with needlepoint or knitting during her liege 's absence . As it was , he knew that as soon as he had left , she would become immersed in her curling club , bridge , and amateur oil painting which were the mainstays of her life . Sarah Demerest 's placidity , and her dullness which naturally went with it , were qualities her husband had come to accept and , in a perverse way , valued . Between flying trips and affairs with more interesting women , he thought of his sojourns at home , and sometimesspoke of them to intimates , as " going into the hangar for a stand down . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women he made love to could become as emotional and demandingas they liked , but he could never be expected to meet the ultimate demand of matrimony . In this way , he had a perpetual protection against his own hasty action in the heat of passion . AsAIRPORT 49to sexual intimacy with Sarah , he still obliged her occasionally , as one would play " throw the ball " with an old dog . Sarah responded dutifully , with conventional body heavings and quickened breath , though he suspected both were more from rote than passion , and that if they quit copulation entirely she would not be overly concerned . He was also sure that Sarah suspected his philandering , if not in fact , then at least by instinct . But , characteristically , she would prefer not to know , an arrangement in which Vernon Demerest was happy to cooperate . Another thing which had pleased him this evening was the AirlinesSnow Committee report in which he had delivered a verbal kick in the crotch , aimed at his stuffed-shirt brother-in-law , Mel Bakersfeld . The critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two airline representatives on the committee had at first taken the view that the airport management was doing its best under exceptionalconditions . Captain Demerest argued otherwise . The others had finally gone along with him and agreed that Demerest would personally write the report , which he made as scathing as he could . He had not bothered about accuracy or otherwise of the indictment ; after all , with so much snow around , who could be sure of anything ? He had , however , made certain that the widely circulated report would cause a maximum of embarrassment and irritation to Mel Bakersfeld . Copies were now being Xeroxed and would be sent to regional vice-presidents of all airlines , as well as airline headquarters , in New York and elsewhere . Knowing how everyone enjoyed finding a scapegoat for operational delays , Captain Demerest was confident that telephones and teletypes would be busy after its receipt . A revenge , Vernon Demerest thought pleasurably  --  small but satisfying  --  hadbeen exacted . Now , perhaps , his limping , quarter-cripple brother-in-law would think twice before antagonizing Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had presumedto do  --  in public  --  two weeks ago . Captain Demerest swung the Mercedes into an apartment building parking lot . He stopped the car smoothly and got out . He was a little early , he noticed  --  a quarter of an hour before the time he had said he would collect Gwen and drive her to the airport . He decided to go up , anyway . As he entered the building , using the passkey Gwen had given50 AIRPORThim , he hummed softly to himself , then smiled , realizing the tune was 0 Sole Mio . Well , why not ? It was appropriate . Naples . . . a warm night instead of snow , the view above the bay in starlight , soft music from mandolins , Chianti with dinner , and Gwen Meighen beside him . . . all were less than twenty-four hours away . Yes , indeed !  --  O Sole Mio . He continued humming it . In the elevator going up , he remembered another good thing . The flight to Rome would be an easy one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two  --  The Golden Argosy  --  he would do little of the work which the flight entailed . The reason was that he was flying as a line check captain . Another four-striper captain  --  Anson Harris , almost as senior as Demerest himself  --  had been assigned to the flight and would occupy the command pilot 's left seat . Demerest would use the right seat  --  normally the first officer 's position  --  from where he would observe and report on Captain Harris 's performance . The check flight arrangement had come up because Captain Harris had elected to transfer from Trans America domestic operations to international . However , before flying as a full-fledged international captain , he was required to make two flights over an overseas route with a regular line captain who also held instructor 's qualifications . Vernon Demerest did . After Captain Harris 's two flights , of which tonight 's would be the second , he would be given a final check by a senior supervisory captain before being accepted for international command . Such checks  --  as well as regular six-monthly check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to undergo  --  entailed an aerial scrutiny of ability and flying habits . The checks took place on ordinary scheduled flights , and the only indication a passenger might have that one was in progress would be the presence of two four-striper captains on the flight deck up front . Despite the fact that captains checked each other , the tests , both regular and special , were usually serious , exacting sessions . The pilots wanted them that way . Too much was at stake  --  public safety and high professional standards  --  for any mutual back-scratching , or for weaknesses to be overlooked . A captain being checked was aware that he must measure up to required standards in all respects . Failure to do so would mean an automatic adverse report which , if seriousAIRPORT 5ienough , could lead to an even tougher session with the airline 's chief pilot , with the testee 's job in jeopardy . Yet , while performance standards were not relaxed , senior captainsundergoing flight checks were treated by their colleagues with meticulous courtesy . Except by Vernon Demerest . Demerest treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior to himself , in precisely the same way  --  like an errant schoolboy summoned to the headmaster 's presence . Moreover , in the headmaster'srole , Demerest was officious , arrogant , condescending , and tough . He made no secret of his conviction that no one else 's ability as a pilot was superior to his own . Colleagues who received this brand of treatment raged inwardly , but had no choice but to sit and take it . Subsequently they vowed to one another that when Demerest 's own time came they would give him the meanest , toughest check ride he had ever had . They invariably did , with a single consistentresult  --  Vernon Demerest turned in a flawless performance which could not be faulted . This afternoon , characteristically , Demerest prefaced his check sessionby telephoning Captain Anson Harris at home . " It 'll be a bad night for driving , " Demerest said without preamble . " I like my crew to be punctual , so I suggest you allow plenty of time to get to the airport . " Anson Harris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been late for a single flight , was so outraged , he almost choked . Fortunately , before Harris could get any words out , Captain Demerest hung up . Still fuming , but to make absolutely sure that Demerest would not catch him out , Captain Harris had arrived at the airport almost three hours ahead of flight time instead of the usual one hour . Captain Demerest , fresh from his stint with the Airlines Snow Committee , had encountered Harris in the Cloud Captain 's Coffee Shop . Demerest was wearing a sports jacket and slacks ; he kept a spare uniform in his airport locker and planned to change into it later . Captain Harris , a graying , grizzled veteran whom many younger pilots addressed as " sir , " was in Trans America uniform . " Hi , Anson . " Vernon Demerest dropped into an adjoining seat at the counter . " I see you took my good advice . " Captain Harris 's grip on his coffee cup tightened slightly , but all he said was , " Good evening , Vern. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefing twenty minutes earlier than usual , " Demerest said . " I want to check your flight manuals . " Thank God , Harris thought , his wife had gone through his manualsonly yesterday , inserting the very latest amendments . But he had better check his mail slot in the dispatch office . This bastard was likely to fault him for not making an amendment published only this afternoon . To give his hands  --  which were itching  --  something to do , Captain Harris filled and lit his pipe . He was aware of Vernon Demerest looking at him critically . " You 're not wearing a regulation shirt . " For a moment , Captain Harris could not believe his colleague was serious . Then , as he realized he was , Harris 's face suffused a deep plum red . Regulation shirts were an irritant to Trans America pilots , as they were to pilots of other airlines . Obtainable through company sources , the official shirts cost nine dollars each , and were often ill fitting , their material of dubious quality . Though contrary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several dollars less , with the difference in appearance scarcely noticeable . Most pilots bought the unofficial shirts and wore them . Vernon Demerest did too . On several occasions Anson Harris had heard Demerest speak disdainfully of the company 's shirts and point to the superior quality of his own . Captain Demerest motioned to a waitress for coffee , then reassuredHarris , " It 's all right . I wo n't report on your wearing a non-reg shirt here . As long as you change it before you come on my flight . " Hold on ! Anson Harris told himself . Dear God in heaven , give me strength not to blow , which is probably what the ornery son-o f - abitchwants . But why ? Why ? All right . All right , he decided ; indignity or not , he would change his unofficial shirt for a regulation one . He would not give Demerest the satisfaction of having a single miniscule check point on which to fault him . It would be difficult to get a company shirt tonight . He would probably have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or first officer . When he told them why , they would hardly believe him . He hardly believed it himself . But when Demerest 's own check flight came up . . . the next , and all others from this moment on . . . let him beware . Anson Harris had good friends among the supervisory pilots . Let Demerestbe wearing a regulation shirt ; let him hew to regulations in every other trifling way . . . or else . Then Harris thought glumly : The foxy bastard will remember ; he 'll make sure he does . " Hey , Anson ! " Demerest seemed amused . " You 've bitten off the end of your pipe . " And so he had . Remembering , Vernon Demerest chuckled . Yes , it would be an easy flight tonight  --  for him . His thoughts returned to the present as the apartment block elevator stopped at the third floor . He stepped into the carpeted corridor and turned to the left familiarly , heading for the apartment which Gwen Meighen shared with a stewardess of United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gwen had told him , was away on an overnight flight . On the apartment door bell he tapped out their usual signal , his initials in Morse . . . dit-dit-dit-dah dahdit-dit. . . then went in , using the same key which opened the door below . Gwen was in the shower . He could hear the water running . When he went to her bedroom door , she called out , " Vernon , is that you ? " Even competing with the shower , her voice  --  with its flawlessEnglish accent , which he liked so much  --  sounded mellow and exciting . He thought : Small wonder Gwen had so much success with passengers . He had seen them appear to melt  --  the men especially  --  when her natural charm was turned toward them . He called back , " Yes , honey . " Her filmy underthings were laid out on the bed  --  panties , sheer nylons ; a transparent bra , flesh colored , with a girdle of the same material ; a French silk , hand-embroidered slip . Gwen 's uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive individuality . His senses quickened ; he moved his eyes away reluctantly . " I 'm glad you came early , " she called again . " I want to have a talk before we leave . " " Sure , we 've time . " " You can make tea , if you like . " " Okay . " She had converted him to the English habit of tea at all times of day , though he had scarcely ever drunk tea at all until knowing Gwen . But now he often asked for it at home , a request which puzzled Sarah , particularly when he insisted on it being correctly54 AIRPORTmade  --  the pot warmed first , as Gwen had taught him , the water still boiling at the instant it touched the tea . He went to the tiny kitchen , where he knew his way around , and put a kettle of water on the stove . He poured milk into a jug from a carton in the refrigerator , then drank some milk himself before putting the carton back . He would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilots , abstained from liquor for twenty-four hours before a flight . Out of habit he checked his watch ; it showed a few minutes before 8:oo P.M. At this moment , he realized , the sleek , long-range Boeing 707 jet which he would command on its five-thousand mile flight to Rome , was being readied for him at the airport . He heard the shower stop . In the silence he began humming once again . Happily . 0 Sole Mio. 7The blustering , biting wind across the airfield was as strong as ever , and still driving the heavily falling snow before it . Inside his car , Mel Bakersfeld shivered . He was heading for runway one seven , left , which was being plowed , after leaving runwaythree zero and the stranded Aereo-Mexican jet . Was the shivering due to the cold outside , Mel wondered , or to memory , which the scent of trouble a few minutes ago , plus the nagging reminder from the old injury of his foot , had triggered ? The injury had happened sixteen years ago off the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighter missions from the carrier Essex . Through the previous twelve hours ( he remembered clearly , even now ) he had had a presentiment of trouble coming . It was n't fear  --  like others , he had learned to live with that ; rather , a conviction that something fateful , possibly final , was moving inexorablytoward him . Next day , in a dogfight with a MIG-15 , Mel 's Navy F9F-5 had been shot down into the sea . He managed a controlled ditching , but though unhurt himself , his left foot was trapped by a jammed rudder pedal . With the airplane sinking fast  --  an F9F-5 had the floating characteristics of a brick  --  Mel used a survival-kit hunting knife to slash desperately , wildly , AIRPORT 55at his foot and the pedal . Somehow , underwater , his foot came free . In intense pain , half-drowned , he surfaced . He had spent the next eight hours in the sea before being picked up , unconscious . Later he learned he had severed the ligaments in front of his ankle , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight line . In time , Navy medics repaired the foot , though Mel had never flown  --  as a pilot  --  since then . But at intervals the pain still returned , reminding him that long ago , as on other later occasions , his instinct for trouble had been right . He had the same kind of instinct now . Handling his car cautiously , being careful to retain his bearings in the darkness and restricted visibility , Mel was nearing runway one seven , left . This was the runway which , the tower chief had indicated , Air Traffic Control would seek to use when the wind shifted as was forecast to happen soon . At the moment , on the airfield , two runways were in use : one seven , right , and runway two five . Lincoln International had five runways altogether . Through the past three days and nights they had represented the front line of the battle between the airport and the storm . The longest and widest of the five was three zero , the runway now obstructed by Aereo-Mexican . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the opposite direction , it could also be runway one two . The figures indicated compass headings of 300 and 120 degrees . ) This runway was almost two miles long and as wide as a short city block ; an airport joke claimed that one end could not be seen from the other because of the earth 's curvature . Each of the other four runways was half a mile or so shorter , and less wide . Without ceasing , since the storm began , the miles of runways had been plowed , vacuumed , brushed , and sanded . The motorized equipment  --  severalmillion dollars ' worth of roaring diesels  --  had stopped only minutes at a time , mainly for refueling or relieving crews . It was work which air travelers never saw at close hand because no aircraft used a fresh-cleared runway until the surface had been inspected and declared safe . Standards were exacting . Half an inch of slush or three inches of powdery snow were maximums allowable for jets . More than that would be sucked into engines and endanger operation. 56 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that runway snow teams were not more on public view . The sight was spectacular and stirring . Even now , in storm and darkness , approaching the massed equipmentfrom the rear , the effect was impressive . Giant columns of snow cascaded to the right in arcs of a hundred and fifty feet . The arcs were framed in vehicle searchlights , and shimmered from the added color of some twenty revolving beacons  --  one on the roof of each vehicle in the group . Airport men called the group a Conga Line . It had a head , a tail , a body , and an entourage , and it progressed down a runway with the precision of choreography . A convoy leader was the head . He was a senior foreman from airportmaintenance and drove an airport car  --  bright yellow , like all other equipment in the Line . The leader set the Conga Line pace , which was usually fast . He had two radios and remained permanentlyin touch with the Snow Desk and Air Traffic Control . By a system of lights , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " amber for " maintain pace , " red for " slow down , " and flashing red for " stop . " He was required to carry in his head a detailed map of the airport , and must know precisely where he was , even on the darkest night , as now . Behind the convoy leader , its driver , like an orchestra 's first violinist , was the number one plow  --  tonight a mammoth Oshkosh with a big main blade ahead , and a wing blade to the side . To the rear of number one plow , and on its right , was number two . The first plow heaved the snow aside ; the second accepted the load from the first and , adding more , heaved both lots farther . Then came a Snowblast , in echelon with the plows , six hundred roaring horsepower strong . A Snowblast cost sixty thousand dollars and was the Cadillac of snow clearance . With mighty blowers it engulfed the snow which both plows piled , and hurled it in a herculeanarc beyond the runway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right , were two more plows , a second Snowblast . After the plows and Snowblasts came the graders  --  five in line abreast , with plow blades down to clear any mounds the front plows missed . The graders towed revolving brushes , each sixteen feet wide and independently diesel powered . The brushes scoured the runway surface like monstrous yard brooms . Next were sanders . Where the eleven vehicles ahead had cleared , three hulking FWD trucks , with hoppers holding fourteen cubic feet apiece , spread sand out evenly . The sand was special . Elsewhere around the airport , on roadways and areas which the public used , salt was added to the sand as a means of melting ice . But never for aeronautical areas . Salt corroded metal , shortening its life , and airplanes were treated with more respect than cars . Last in the Conga Line itself  --  " tail-end Charlie "  --  was an assistant foreman in a second car . His job was to insure that the line stayed intact and to chivvy stragglers . He was in radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead in snow and darkness . Finally came the entourage  --  a standby plow , in case one faltered in the Line ; a service truck with a detail of mechanics ; refueling tankers  --  diesel and gasoline ; and  --  when summoned by radio at appointedtimes  --  a coffee and doughnut wagon . Mel accelerated around the entourage and positioned his car alongsidethe assistant foreman 's . His arrival was noticed . He heard the convoy leader notified by radio , " Mr. Bakersfeld just joined us . " The Line was moving fast  --  close to forty miles an hour instead of its usual twenty-five . The leader had probably speeded up because of the expected wind shift and the need to have the runway open soon . Switching his radio to ATC ground frequency , Mel heard the convoy leader call the tower , " . . . on one seven , left , approaching intersection with runway two five . Request clearance over inter-section . " Runway two five was an active runway , now in use . " Convoy leader from ground control , hold short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach . You may not , repeat , not , cross runway intersection . Acknowledge . " The voice from the tower was apologetic . Up there , they understood the difficulty of stopping a rolling Conga Line , and getting it started again . But the approaching flights had undoubtedly made a tricky instrument descent and now were close to landing , one behind the other . Only a desperate emergency would justify sending them round again on such a night . Ahead of Mel , red lights were going on , flashing commandingly as the Conga Line slowed and stopped. 58 AIRPORTThe assistant foreman , a cheerful young Negro , jumped from his car and came across to Mel 's . As he opened the door , the wind swept in , but could only be felt , not heard , above the encompassing roar of idling diesels . The assistant put his mouth against Mel 's ear . " Say , Mr. B. , how 's about joining the Line ? One of the boys 'll take care of your car . " Mel grinned . The pleasure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and occasionally handling heavy motorized equipment was well known around the airport . Why not ? he reasoned . He had come out to inspect the snow clearance as a result of the adverse report by Vernon Demerest 's Airlines Snow Committee . Clearly , the report was unjustified , and everything was going well . But maybe he should watch a few minutes longer from a ringside perch . Nodding agreement , he shouted , " Okay , I 'll ride the second Snowblast . " " Yessir ! " The assistant foreman , carrying a hand searchlight and leaning against the wind , preceded Mel past the now stationary lines of sand trucks and brushes . Mel observed that already fresh snow was starting to cover the runway area cleared only moments ago . To the rear , a figure ducked from a service truck and hastened to Mel 's car . " Better hurry , Mr. B. It 's only a short stop . " The young Negro flashed his light at the Snowblast cab , then held it steady , illuminatingthe way , as Mel clambered up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and held it while Mel eased inside . On the way up , his impaired foot pained him sharply , but there was no time to wait . Ahead , the flashing red lights had already changed to green , and presumably the two approaching aircraft had now landed and were past the intersection . The Conga Line must hurry across before the next landing , perhaps only a minute or two away . Glancing to the rear , Mel could see the assistant foreman sprinting back toward his tail-end-Charlie car . The Snowblast was already moving , picking up speed with a deepthroatedroar . Its driver glanced sideways as Mel slipped into one of the two soft , padded seats . " Hi , Mr. Bakersfeld . " " How are you , Will ? " Mel recognized the man , who , when there was no snow emergency , was employed by the airport as a payroll clerk . AIRPORT 59 " I 'm pretty good , sir . Tired some . " The driver was holding position carefully behind the third and fourth plows , their beacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blades were engorging snow , cramming it to the blower . Once more , a continuous white stream was arcing outward , clear of the runway . Up here was like the bridge of a ship . The driver held his main control wheel lightly , like a helmsman . A multitude of dials and levers , glowing in the darkness , were arranged for fingertip control . Circular , high-speed windshield wipers  --  as on a ship  --  provided ports of clear vision through encrusted snow . " I guess everyone 's tired , " Mel said . " All I can tell you is that this ca n't last forever . " He watched the forward speed needle climb  --  from twenty-five to thirty , thirty to thirty-five . Swinging in his seat , Mel surveyed outside . From this position , at the center of the Conga Line , he could see the lights and shapes of the other vehicles . He noted approvingly that the formation was exact . A few years ago , in a storm like this , an airport would have closed completely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this one area  --  had caught up with progress in the air . But of how many areas of aviation could the same thing be said ? Mel reflected ruefully : very few . " Oh , well , " the driver said , " it makes a change from working an adding machine , and the longer this keeps up , the more extra pay there 'll be when it 's over . " He touched a lever , tilting the cab forward to inspect the auger blades . With another control he adjusted the blades , then releveled the cab . " I do n't have to do this ; you know that , Mr. Bakersfeld , I volunteer . But I kinda like it out here . It 's sort of . . . " He hesitated . " I du n no . " Mel suggested , " Elemental ? " " I guess so . " The driver laughed . " Maybe I 'm snow happy . " " No , Will , I do n't believe you are . " Mel swung forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was elemental here . More to the point , amid the airfield 's loneliness there was a feeling of closeness to aviation , the real aviation which in its simplest sense was man against the elements . You lost that kind of feeling if you stayed too long in terminals and airline office buildings ; there , the extraneous , non-essential things confused you . Maybe all of us in6o AIRPORT AIRPORT 6iaviation management , Mel thought , should stand at the distant end of a runway once in a while , and feel the wind on our faces . It could help to separate detail from fundamentals . It might even ventilateour brains as well . Sometimes in the past Mel had gone out onto the airfield when he needed to think , to reason quietly and alone . He had not expected to tonight , but found himself doing so now . . . wondering , speculating , as he had so often in recent days , about the airport 's future and his own. 8Less than a lustrum ago , the airport was considered among the world 's finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians were given to pointing with pride and would huff and puff about " air leadership " and " a symbol of the jet age . " Nowadays , the politicians still huffed and puffed , but with less reason . What most failed to realize was that Lincoln International , like a surprising number of other major airports , was close to becoming a whited sepulcher . Mel Bakersfeld pondered the phrase whited sepulcher while riding in darkness down runway one seven , left . If was an apt definition , he thought . The airport 's deficiencies were serious and basic , yet , since they were mostly out of public view , only insiders were aware of them . Travelers and visitors at Lincoln International saw principally the main passenger terminal  --  a brightly lighted , air-conditioned Taj Mahal . Of gleaming glass and chrome , the terminal was impressively spacious , its thronged concourses adjoining elegant waiting areas . Opulent service facilities ringed the passenger area . Six specialty restaurants ranged from a gourmet dining room , with gold-edged china and matching prices , to a grab-it-and-run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and neon lit , were plentiful as toilets . While waiting for a flight , and without ever leaving the terminal , a visitor could shop , rent a room and bed , and take a steam bath with massage , have his hair cut , suit pressed , shoes shined , or even die and have his burial arranged by Holy Ghost Memorial Gardens which maintained a sales office on the lower concourse . Judged by its terminal alone , the airport was still spectacular . Where its deficiencies lay were in operating areas , notably runways and taxiways . Few of the eighty thousand passengers who flew in and out each day were aware of how inadequate  --  and therefore hazardous  --  the runway system had become . Even a year previously , runways and taxiways were barely sufficient ; now , they were dangerously overtaxed . In normally busy periods , on two main runways , a takeoff or landing occurred every thirty seconds . The Meadowood situation , and the consideration the airport showed to community residents , made it necessary , at peak periods , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two . As a result , aircraft took off and landed on converging courses , and there were moments when air traffic controllers held their breath and prayed . Only last week Keith Bakersfeld , Mel 's brother , had predicted grimly , " Okay , so we stay on our toes in the tower , and we cope with the hairy ones , and we have n't brought two airplanes together at that intersection yet . But someday there 'll be a second 's inattention or misjudgment , and one of us will . I hope to God it is n't me because when it happens it 'll be the Grand Canyon all over again . " The intersection Keith had spoken of was the one which the Conga Line had just passed over . In the cab of the Snowblast , Mel glanced to the rear . The Conga Line was well clear of the intersectionnow , and , through a momentary gap in the snow , airplane navigation lights were visible on the other runway , moving swiftly as a flight took off . Then , incredibly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another flight landed , it seemed at the same instant . The Snowblast driver had turned his head also . He whistled . " Those two were pretty close . " Mel nodded . They had been close , exceptionally so , and for an instant his flesh had prickled with alarm . Obviously , what had happened was that an air traffic controller , instructing the pilots of both airplanes by radio , had cut tolerances exceedingly fine . As usual , the controller 's skilled judgment had proven right , though only just . The two flights were safe  --  one now in the air , the other on the ground . But it was the need for a multiplicity of such hairbreadth judgments which created an unceasing hazard . Mel had pointed out the hazard frequently to the Board of Air-ii62 AIRPORTport Commissioners and to members of City Council , who controlled airport financing . As well as immediate construction of more runways and taxiways , Mel had urged purchase of additional land around the airport for long term development . There had been plenty of discussion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few Board and Council members saw things the way Mel did , but others took a strongly counter view . It was hard to convince people that a modern jetport , built in the late 195os , could so quickly have become inadequate to the point of danger . It made no difference that the same was true of other centers  --  New York , San Francisco , Chicago , and elsewhere ; there were certain things which politicians simply did not want to see . Mel thought : maybe Keith was right . Perhaps it would take another big disaster to arouse public awareness , just as the 1956 Grand Canyondisaster had spurred : President Eisenhower and the EightyfourthCongress to revamp the airways . Yet , ironically , there was seldom any difficulty in getting money for non-operational improvements . A proposal to triple-deck all parking lots had won city approval without dissent . But that was something which the public  --  includingthose who had votes  --  could see and touch . Runways and taxiways were different . A single new runway cost several million dollars and took two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air traffic controllers , and airport management , ever knew how good or bad a runway system was . But at Lincoln International a showdown was coming soon . It had to . In recent weeks , Mel had sensed the signs , and when it happened the choice would be clear  --  between advancement on the ground , matching new achievements in the air , or impotently drifting backward . In aviation , there was never a status quo . There was another factor . As well as the airport 's future , Mel 's personal future was at stake . Whichever way airport policies veered , so would his own prestige advance or lessen in places where it counted most . Only a short time ago , Mel Bakersfeld had been a national spokesmanfor ground logistics of aviation , had been touted as the rising young genius in aviation management . Then , abruptly , a single , calamitous event had wrought a change . Now , four years later , the future was no longer clear , and there were doubts and questioning about Mel Bakersfeld , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AIRPORT 63The event which caused the change was the John F. Kennedy assassination . " Here 's the end of the runway , Mr. Bakersfeld . You riding back with us , or what ? " The voice of the Snowblast driver broke in on Mel 's reverie . " Elm ? " The man repeated his question . Ahead of them , once more , warning lights were flashing on , the Conga Line showing . Half the width of a runway was cleared at one time . Now , the Line would reverse itself and go back the way it had come , clearing the remaining portion . Allowing for stops and starts , it took forty-five minutes to an hour to plow and sand a single runway . " No , " Mel said . " I 'll get off here . " " Right , sir . " The driver directed a signal light at the assistant foreman 's car which promptly swung out of line . A few moments later , as Mel clambered down , his own car was waiting . From other plows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon . Driving back toward the terminal , Mel radioed the Snow Desk , confirming to Danny Farrow that runway one seven , left , would be usable shortly . Then , switching to ATC ground control , he turned the volume low , the subdued , level voices a background to his thoughts . In the Snowblast cab he had been reminded of the event which , of all others he remembered , had struck with greatest impact . It had been four years ago . He thought , startled , was it really that long ago ?  --  four years since the gray November afternoon when , dazedly , he had pulled the p.a. microphone across his desk toward him  --  the microphone , rarely used , which overrode all others in the terminal  --  and cutting in on a flight arrival bulletin , had announced to concourses which swiftly hushed , the shattering news which seconds earlier had flashed from Dallas . His eyes , as he spoke then , had been on the photograph on the facing wall across his office , the photograph whose inscription read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I am , with attenuating the surly bonds of earth  --  John F. Kennedy . The photograph still remained , as did many memories . The memories began , for Mel , with a speech he had made in Washington , D.C.64 AIRPORTAt the time , as well as airport general manager , he had been president of the Airport Operators Council  --  the youngest leader , ever , of that small but influential body linking major airports of the world . AOC headquarters was in Washington , and Mel flew there frequently . His speech was to a national planning congress . Aviation , Mel Bakersfeld had pointed out , was the only truly successful international undertaking . It transcended ideological boundariesas well as the merely geographic . Because it was a means of intermingling diverse populations at ever-diminishing cost , it offered the most practical means to world understanding yet devised by man . Even more significant was aerial commerce . Movement of freight by air , already mammoth in extent , was destined to be greater still . The new , giant jet airplanes , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fastest and cheapest cargo carriers in human history ; within a decade , oceangoing ships might be dry-dock museum pieces , pushed out of business in the same way that passenger airplaneshad clobbered the Queen Mary and Elizabeth . The effect could be a new , world-wide argosy of trade , with prosperity for now impoverished nations . Technologically , Mel reminded his audience , the airborne segment of aviation offered these things , and more , within the lifetimes of today 's middle-aged people . Yet , he had continued , while airplane designers wove the stuff of dreams into fabrics of reality , facilities on the ground remained , for the most part , products of shortsightedness or misguided haste . Airports , runway systems , terminals , were geared to yesterday , with scant  --  if any  --  provision for tomorrow ; what was lost sight of , or ignored , was the juggernaut speed of aviation 's progress . Airports were set up piecemeal , as individually as city halls , and often with as small imagination . Usually , too much was spent on showplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-level planning , either national or international , was non-existent . At local levels , where politicians were apathetic about problems of ground access to airports , the situation was as bad , or worse . We have broken the sound barrier , " Mel declared , but not the ground barrier . " He listed specific areas for study and urged international planning  --  U.S. led and presidentially inspired  --  for aviation on the ground . The speech was accorded a standing ovation and was widely re-AIRPORT 65ported . It produced approving nods from such diverse sources as The Times of London , Pravda , and The Wall Street Journal . The day after the speech , Mel was invited to the White House . The meeting with the President had gone well . It had been a relaxed , good-humored session in the private study on the White House second floor . J.F.K. , Mel found , shared many of his own ideas . Subsequently , there were other sessions , some of them " brain trust " affairs involving Kennedy aides , usually when the Administration was considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aftermaths , Mel was at home in the White House , and less surprised than he had been at first to find himself there at all . As time went on , he drifted into one of those easygoing relationships which J.F.K. encouraged among those with expertise to offer him . It was a year or so after their first encounter that the President sounded Mel out about heading the Federal Aviation Agency . ( It was an Agency then , an Administration later . ) Sometime during the Kennedy second term , which everyone assumed would be automatic , the incumbent FAA Administrator , Halaby , would move on to other things . How did Mel feel about implementing , from within , some of the measures he had advocated from without ? Mel had replied that he was very interested indeed . He made it clear that if an offer was made , his answer would be yes . Word filtered out , not from Mel , but through others who had had it from the top . Mel was " in "  --  a dues-paid member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher still . The Airport Operators Council re-elected him president . His own airport commissionersvoted him a handsome raise . Barely in his late thirties , he was considered the Childe Roland of aviation management . Six months later , John F. Kennedy made his fateful Texas journey . Like others , Mel was first stunned , then later wept . Only later still , did it dawn on him that the assassin 's bullets had ricocheted onto the lives of others , his own among them . He discovered he was no longer " in " in Washington . Najeeb Halaby did , in fact , move on from FAA  --  to a senior vice-presidency of Pan American  --  but Mel did not succeed him . By then , power had shifted , influences waned . Mel 's name , he later learned , was not even on President Johnson 's short list for the FAA appointment . Mel 's second tenure as AOC president ran out uneventfully and66 AIRPORT I AIRPORT 67another bright young man succeeded him . Mel 's trips to Washington ceased . His public appearances became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he found the change to be a relief . His own responsibilities at Lincoln International had already increased as air traffic proliferatedbeyond most expectations . He became intensely occupied with planning , coupled with efforts to persuade the Board of Airport Commissioners to his own viewpoints . There was plenty to think about , including troubles at home . His days and weeks and months were full . And yet , there was a sense that time and opportunity had passed him by . Others were aware of it . Unless something dramatic occurred , Mel surmised , his career might continue , and eventually end , preciselywhere he was . " Tower to mobile one  --  what is your position ? " The radio enjoinder broke through Mel 's thoughts , returning him abruptly to the present . He turned up the radio volume and reported . By now , he was nearing the main passenger terminal , its lights becoming clearer , despite the still heavily falling snow . The aircraft parking areas , he observed , were as fully occupied as when he left , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions to be vacated . " Mobile one , hold until the Lake Central Nord crosses ahead of you , then follow it in . " " This is mobile one . Roger . " A few minutes later , Mel eased his car into the terminal basement parking area . Near his parking stall was a locked box with an airport telephone . He used one of his passkeys to open the box , and dialed the Snow Desk . Danny Farrow answered . Was there any fresh news , Mel inquired , about the mired Aereo-Mexican jet ? " Negative , " Danny said . " And the tower chief said to tell you that not being able to use runway three zero is still slowing traffic fifty percent . Also , he 's getting more phone complaints from Meadowood every time there 's a takeoff over there . " Mel said grimly , " Meadowood will have to suffer . " Community meeting or not , there was nothing he could do to eliminate overhead noise for the time being . The most important thing at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Joe Patroni now ? " " Same place . Still held up . " Can he make it for sure ? " " TWA says so . He has a phone in his car , and they 've been in touch . " " As soon as Joe gets here , " Mel instructed , " I want to be notified . Wherever I am . " " That 'll be downtown , I guess . " Mel hesitated . There was no reason , he supposed , why he need remain at the airport any longer tonight . Yet again , unaccountably , he had the same sense of foreboding which had disturbed him on the airfield . He remembered his conversation earlier with the tower watch chief , the line of waiting aircraft on the ramp apron outside . He made a spontaneous decision . " No , I wo n't be downtown . We need that runway badly , and I 'm not leaving until I know positively that Patroni is out there on the field , in charge . " " In that case , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . Here 's the number she 's at . " Mel wrote it down , then depressed the receiver rest and dialed the downtown number . He asked for Cindy , and after a brief wait , heard her voice say sharply , " Mel , why are n't you here ? " " I 'm sorry , I was held up . There 've been problems at the airport . It 's a pretty big storm . . . " " Damn you , get down here fast ! " From the fact that his wife 's voice was low , Mel deduced there were others within hearing . Just the same , she managed to convey a surprising amount of venom . Mel sometimes tried to associate the voice of Cindy nowadays with the Cindy he remembered before their marriage fifteen years ago . She had been a gentler person then , it seemed to him . In fact , her gentleness had been one of the things which appealed to Mel when they first met in San Francisco , he on leave from the Navy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though in a minor way because the career she had hoped for had not worked out , and clearly was n't going to . She had had a succession of diminishingly small parts in summer stock and television , and afterward , in a moment of frankness , admitted that marriage had been a welcome release from the whole thing . Years later , that story changed a little , and it became a favorite gambit of Cindy 's to declare that she had sacrificed her career and probable stardom because of Mel . More recently , though , Cindy68 AIRPORT AIRPORT 69did n't like her past as an actress being mentioned at all . That was because she had read in Town and Country that actresses were seldom , if ever , included in The Social Register , and addition of her own name to the Register was something Cindy wanted very much indeed . " I 'm coming downtown to join you just as soon as I can , " Mel said . Cindy snapped , " That is n't good enough . You should be here already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and a week ago you made a definite promise . " " A week ago I did n't know we were going to have the biggest storm in six years . Right now we 've a runway out of use , there 's a question of airport safety . . . " " You 've people working for you , have n't you ? Or are the ones you 've chosen so incompetent they ca n't be left alone ? " Mel said irritably , " They 're highly competent . But I get paid to take some responsibility , too . " " It 's a pity you ca n't act responsibly to me . Time and again I make important social arrangements which you enjoy demolishing . " Listening , as the words continued , Mel sensed that Cindy was getting close to boiling point . Without any effort , he could visualize her now , five feet six of imperious energy in her highest heels , clear blue eyes flashing , and her blonde coiffed head tilted back in that damnably attractive way she had when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed , why , in their early years of marriage , his wife 's temper outbursts seldom dismayed him . The more heated she became , it always seemed , the more desirable she grew . At such moments , he had invariably let his eyes rove upward , beginning at her ankles  --  not hurriedly , because Cindy possessed extraordinarily attractive ankles and legs ; in fact , better than those of most other women Mel knew  --  to the rest of her which was just as proportionate and physically appealing . In the past , when his eyes had made their appreciative assessment , some two-way physical communion sprang into being , prompting each to reach out , to touch one another , impulsively , hungrily . The result was predictable . Invariably , the origin of Cindy 's anger was forgotten in a wave of sensuality which engulfed them . Cindy had an exciting , insistent savagery , and in their lovemaking would demand , " Hurt me , goddam you , hurt me ! " At the end , they would be spent anddrained , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either had the wish or energy to do . It was , of course , a way of shelving , rather than resolving , differenceswhich  --  Mel realized , even early on  --  were fundamental . As the years passed , and passion lessened , accumulated differences becamemore sharply accented . Eventually , they ceased entirely to use sex as a panacea and , in the past year or so , physical intimacy of any kind had become more and more occasional . Cindy , in fact , whose bodily appetites had always needed satisfying whatever the state of mind between them , appeared in recent months to have become indifferent altogether . Mel had wondered about that . Had his wife taken a lover ? It was possible , and Mel supposed he ought to care . The sad thing was , it seemed easier not to be concerned . Yet there were still moments when the sight or sound of Cindy in her willful anger could stir him physically , arousing old desires . He had that feeling now as he listened to her excoriating voice on the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " It is n't true that I enjoy demolishing your arrangements . Most of the time I go along with what you want , even though I do n't think the things we go to are all that important . What I would enjoy are a few more evenings at home with the children . " " That 's a lot of crap , " Cindy said , " and you know it . " He felt himself tense , gripping the telephone more tightly . Then he conceded to himself : perhaps the last remark was true , to an extent . Earlier this evening he had been reminded of the times he had stayed at the airport when he could have gone home  --  merely because he wanted to avoid another fight with Cindy . Roberta and Libby had got left out of the reckoning then , as children did , he supposed , when marriages went sour . He should not have mentioned them . But apart from that , tonight was different . He ought to stay on at the airport , at least until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocked runway . " Look , " Mel said , " let 's make one thing clear . I have n't told you this before , but last year I kept some notes . You wanted me to come to fifty-seven of your charitable whingdings . Out of that I managed forty-five , which is a whole lot more than I 'd attend from choice , but it is n't a bad score . " 70 AIRPORT " You bastard ! I 'm not a ball game where you keep a scorecard . I 'm your wife . " Mel said sharply , " Take it easy ! " He was becoming angry , himself . " Also , in case you do n't know it , you 're raising your voice . Do you want all those nice people around to know what kind of a heel you have for a husband ? " " I do n't give a goddam ! " But she said it softly , just the same . " I do know you 're my wife , which is why I intend to get down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would happen , Mel wondered , if he could reach out and touch Cindy now ? Would the old magic work ? He decided not . " So save me a place , and tell the waiter to keep my soup warm . Also , apologize and explain why I 'm late . I presume some of the people there have heard there is an airport . " A thought struck him . " Incidentally , what 's the occasion tonight ? " " I explained last week . " " Tell me again . " " It 's a publicity party  --  cocktails and dinner  --  to promote the costume ball which is being given next month for the Archidona Children 's Relief Fund . The press is here . They 'll be taking photographs . " Now Mel knew why Cindy wanted him to hurry . With him there , she stood a better chance of being in the photographs  --  and on tomorrow 's newspaper social pages . " Most other committee members , " Cindy insisted , " have their hus- bands here already . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And you did say the Archidona Relief Fund ? " " Yes . " " Which Archidona ? There are two . One 's in Ecuador , the other in Spain . " At college , maps and geography had fascinated Mel , and he had a retentive memory . For the first time , Cindy hesitated . Then she said testily , " What does it matter ? This is n't the time for stupid questions . " Mel wanted to laugh out loud . Cindy did n't know . As usual , she had chosen to work for a charity because of who was involved , rather than what . He said maliciously , " How many letters do you expect to get from this one ? " " I do n't know what you mean . " " Oh , yes , you do . " To be considered for listing in The Social Register , a new aspirant needed eight sponsoring letters from people whose names already appeared there . At the last count Mel had heard , Cindy had collected four . By God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other time .. : ' " Will the letters be free ones , or do you expect to pay for them like those other two ? " He was aware of having an advantage now . It happened very rarely . Cindy said indignantly , " That 's a filthy allegation . It 's impossible to buy your way in ... " " Nuts ! " Mel said . " I get the canceled checks from our joint account . Remember ? " There was a silence . Then Cindy asserted , low-voiced and savagely , " Listen to me ! You 'd better get here tonight , and soon . If you do n't come , or if you do come and embarrass me by saying anything of what you did just now , it 'll be the end . Do you understand ? " " I 'm not sure that I do . " Mel spoke quietly . Instinct cautioned him that this was an important moment for them both . " Perhaps you 'd better tell me exactly what you mean . " Cindy countered , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way from the parking area to his office , Mel 's fury seethed and grew . Anger had always come to him less quickly than to Cindy . He was the slow-burn type . But he was burning now . He was not entirely sure of the focus of his anger . A good deal was directed at Cindy , but there were other factors , too : His professionalfailure , as he saw it , to prepare effectually for a new era of aviation ; a seeming inability to infuse others any longer with his own convictions ; high hopes , unfulfilled . Somehow , between them all , Mel thought , his personal and professional lives had become twin testaments to inadequacy . His marriage was on the rocks , or apparently about to go there ; if and when it did , he would have failed his children , also . At the same time , at the airport , where he was trustee for thousands who passed through daily in good faith , all his efforts and persuasion had failed to halt deterioration . There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily . En route to the executive mezzanine , he encountered no one he knew . It was just as well . If he had been spoken to , whatever question had been put , he would have snarled a heated answer . In his office , he peeled off the heavy outdoor clothing and let it stay on the floor where it fell . He lit a cigarette . It had an acrid taste , and he stubbed it out . As he crossed to his desk , he was aware that the pain in his foot had returned , increasingly . There was a time  --  it seemed long ago  --  when on nights like this , if his wounded foot pained him , he would have gone home , where Cindy would have insisted he relax . He would have a hot bath first , then after , while he lay face downward on their bed , she would massage his back and neck with cool , firm fingers until pain ebbed out of him . It was unthinkable , of course , that Cindy would ever do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he doubted that it would work . You could lose communication in other ways besides the spoken word . Seated at his desk , Mel put his head in his hands . As he had done on the airfield earlier , he shivered . Then , abruptly in the silent office , a telephone bell jangled . For a moment he ignored it . It rang again , and he realized it was the red alarm system telephone on a stand beside the desk . In two swift strides he reached it . " Bakersfeld here . " He heard clicks and more acknowledgments as others came on the line . " This is Air Traffic Control , " the tower chief 's voice announced . " We have an airborne emergency , category three . " 9Keith Bakersfeld , Mel 's brother , was a third of the way through his eight-hour duty watch in the air traffic control radar room . In radar control , tonight 's storm was having a profound effect , though not a directly physical one . To a spectator , Keith thought , lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radarscopes was telling , it might have seemed that the storm , raging immediately outside , was a thousand miles away . The radar room was in the control tower , one floor down fromthe glass-surrounded eyrie  --  the tower cab  --  from which ATC directed aircraft movement on the ground and immediate local flying . The radar section 's jurisdiction extended beyond the airport , and radar controllers reached out to bridge the gap between local control and the nearest ATC regional center . The regional centers  --  usually miles from any airport  --  controlled main trunk airways and traffic coming on and off them . In contrast to the top portion of the tower , the radar room had no windows . Day and night , at Lincoln International , ten radar controllers and supervisors labored in perpetual semidarkness under dim moonglow lights . Around them , tightly packed equipmentradarscopes , controls , radio communications panels  --  lined all four walls . Usually , controllers worked in shirtsleeves since the temperature , winter or summer , was maintained at an even seventy degrees to protect the delicate electronic gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , beneath the calmness , at all times , was a constant nervous strain . Tonight , the strain had been added to by the storm and , within the past few minutes , it had heightened further still . The effect was like stretching an already tensioned spring . Cause of the added tension was a signal on a radarscope which , in turn , had triggered a flashing red light and alarm buzzer in the control room . The buzzer had now been silenced , but the distinctive radar signal remained . Known as a double blossom , it had flowered on the semidarkened screen like a tremulous green carnation and denoted an aircraft in distress . In this case , the aircraft was a U. S. Air Force KC-135 , high above the airport in the storm , and seeking an immediate emergency landing . Keith Bakersfeld had been working the flatface scope on which the emergency signal appeared , and a supervisor had since joined him . Both were now transmitting urgent , swift decisions  --  by interphone to controllers at adjoining positions , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor above had been promptly informed of the distress signal . He , in turn , had declared a category three emergency , alerting airport ground facilities . The flatface scope , at the moment the center of attention , was a horizontal glass circle , the size of a bicycle tire , set into a tabletop console . Its surface was dark green , with brilliant green points of light showing all aircraft in the air within a forty-mile radius . As74 AIRPORT I AIRPORT 75Ithe aircraft moved , so did the points of light . Beside each light point was a small plastic marker , identifying it . The markers were known colloquially as " shrimp boats " and controllers moved them by hand as aircraft progressed and their positions on the screen changed . As more aircraft appeared , they were identified by voice radio and similarly tagged . New radar systems dispensed with shrimp boats ; instead , identifying letter-number codes  --  including altitude  --  appeareddirectly on the radar screen . But the newer method was not yet in wide use and , like all new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an extraordinary number of aircraft on the screen , and someone had remarked earlier that the green pinpoints were proliferating like fecund ants . Keith was seated closest to the flatface , his lean , spindly figure hunched forward in a gray steel chair . His body was tense ; his legs , hooked underneath the chair , were as rigid as the chair itself . He was concentrating , his face strained and gaunt , as it had been for months . The green reflection of the scope accentuated , eerily , deep hollows beneath his eyes . Anyone who knew Keith well , but had not seen him for a year or so , would have been shocked both by his appearance and his change in manner . Once , he had exuded an amiable , relaxed good-nature ; now , all signs of it were gone . Keith was six years younger than his brother , Mel , but nowadays appeared a good deal older . The change in Keith Bakersfeld had been noticed by his colleagues , some of whom were working tonight at other control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reason for the change , a reason which had evoked genuine sympathy . However , they were practical men with an exacting job , which was why the radar supervisor , Wayne Tevis , was observing Keith covertly at this moment , watching the signs of increasing strain , as he had for some time . Tevis , a lanky , drawling Texan , sat centrally in the radar room on a high stool from where he could peer down over the shoulders of operators at the several radarscopes serving special functions . Tevis had personally equipped the stool with castors , and periodically he rode it like a horse , propelling himself by jabs of his hand-tooled Texan boots wherever he was needed at the moment . During the preceding hour , Wayne Tevis had at no point moved far away from Keith . The reason was that Tevis was ready , if necessary , to relieve Keith from radar watch , a decision which instinct told him might have to be made at any time . The radar supervisor was a kindly man , despite his mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was aware of how far-reaching , for Keith , its effect could be . Nevertheless , if he had to , he would do it . His eyes on Keith 's flatface scope , Tevis drawled , " Keith , old son , that Braniff flight is closing on Eastern . If you turn Braniff right , you can keep Eastern going on the same course . " It was something which Keith should have seen himself , but had n't . The problem , which most of the radar room crew was working at feverishly , was to clear a path for the Air Force KC-135 , which had already started down on an instrument landing approach from ten thousand feet . The difficulty was  --  below the big Air Force jet were five airline flights , stacked at intervals of a thousand feet , and orbiting a limited airspace . All were awaiting their turn to land . A few miles on either side were other columns of aircraft , similarly stacked and , lower still , were three more airliners , already on landing approaches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the military flight had to be threaded down through the stacked civilian airplanes without a collision occurring . Under normal conditionsthe assignment would test the strongest nerves . As it was , the situation was complicated by radio failure in the KC-135 , so that voice contact with the Air Force pilot had been lost . Keith Bakersfeld thumbed his microphone . " Braniff eight twentynine , make an immediate right turn , heading zero-niner-zero . " At moments like this , even though pressures built to fever pitch , voices should stay calm . Keith 's voice was high-pitched and betrayed his nervousness . He saw Wayne Tevis glance at him sharply . But the blips on the radar screen , which had been uncomfortably close , began separating as the Braniff captain obeyed instructions . There were moments  --  this was one  --  when air traffic controllers thanked whatever gods they acknowledged for the swift , alert responses of airline pilots . The pilots might beef , and often did subsequently , at being given sudden course changes which required tight , abrupt turns and shook up passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " they obeyed instantly and argued later . In another minute or so the Braniff flight would have to be turned again , and so would Eastern , which was at the same level . Even before that , there must be new courses for two T WAS  --  one higher , the other lower  --  plus a Lake Central Convair , an Air Canada Vanguard , and a Swissair just coming on the screen . Until the KC-135 had come through , these and others must be given zigzag courses , though for brief distances only , since none must stray into adjoining airspaces . In a way , it was like an intricate chess game , except that all the pieces were at various levels and moving at several hundred miles an hour . Also as part of the game , pieces had to be raised or lowered while they still moved forward , yet none must come closer than three miles laterally or a thousand feet vertically from another , and none must go over the edge of the board . And while all of it happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to end , had to sit in their airborne seatsandwait . In occasional moments of detachment , Keith wondered how the Air Force pilot , in difficulty and letting down through storm and crowded airspace , was feeling at this moment . Lonely , probably . Just as Keith himself was lonely ; just as all life was lonely , even with others physically close beside you . The pilot would have a copilotand crew , in the same way that Keith had fellow-workers who , at this moment , were near enough to touch . But that was not the kind of nearness which counted . Not when you were alone in that inner room of the mind , where no one else could enter , and where you lived  --  apart and solitary  --  with awareness , memory , conscience , fear . Alone , from the moment you were born until you died . Always , and forever , alone . Keith Bakersfeld knew how much alone a single human being could be . In succession , Keith gave fresh courses to Swissair , one of the T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could hear Wayne Tevis trying to raise the Air Force KC-135 on radio again . Still no response , except that the distress radar blip , actuated by the KC-135 pilot , still blossomed on the scope . The position of the blip showed the pilot was doing the right thing  --  following exactly the instructions he had been given before the radio failure happened . In doing so , he would be aware that air traffic control could anticipate his movements . He would also know that his position could be seen by radar on the ground , and trusted that other traffic would be routed out of his way . The Air Force flight , Keith knew , had originated in Hawaii and come non-stop after mid-air refueling over the West Coast , its destinationAndrews Air Force Base , near Washington . But west of the Continental Divide there had been an engine failure , and afterward electrical trouble , causing the airplane commander to elect an unscheduledlanding at Smoky Hill , Kansas . At Smoky Hill , however , snow clearance of runways had not been completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Route Control nursed the military flight northeast across Missouri and Illinois . Then , thirty miles out , West Arrivals Control , in the person of Keith Bakersfeld , took over . It was soon afterward that radio failure had been added to the pilot 's other troubles . Most times , when flying conditions were normal , military aircraft stayed clear of civil airports . But in a storm like tonight 's help was asked  --  and given  --  without question . In this darkened , tightly packed radar room , other controllers , as well as Keith , were sweating . Yet no hint of pressures or tension must be betrayed by controllers ' voices when speaking with pilots in the air . The pilots had plenty to concern themselves with at any time . Tonight , buffeted by the storm , and flying solely on instruments with nil visibility outside their cockpits , demands upon their skill were multiplied . Most pilots had already flown extra time because of delays caused by heavy traffic ; now they would have to stay even longer in the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of radio orders was going out to hold even more flights clear of the danger area . The flights were awaiting their own turn to land and every minute or two were being joined by new arrivals coming off airways . A controller , his voice low but urgent , called over his shoulder . " Chuck , I 've got a hot one . Can you take Delta seven three ? " It was a controller 's way of saying he was in trouble and had more than he could handle . Another voice . " Hell !  --  I 'm piled up , too .. . Wait ! ... Af-irmative , I got it . " A second 's pause . " Delta seven three from Lincoln approach control . Turn left ; heading one two zero . Maintain altitude , f our thousand ! " Controllers helped each other when they could . A few minutes from now the second man might need help himself . " Hey , watch that Northwest ; he 's coming through from the other side . Christ ! it 's getting like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American f our f our , hold present heading , 78 AIRPORTwhat 's your altitude ? " ... " That Lufthansa departure 's way offfcourse . Get him the hell out of the approach area ! " ... Departing flights were being routed well around the trouble area , but arrivals were being held up , valuable landing time lost . Even later , when the emergency would be over , everyone knew it would take an hour or more to unravel the aerial traffic jam . Keith Bakersfeld was trying hard to maintain his concentration , to retain a mental picture of his sector and every aircraft in it . It required instant memorizing  --  identifications , positions , types of aircraft , speeds , altitudes , sequence of landing ... a detailed diagram , in depth , with constant changes ... a configuration which was never still . Even at quieter times , mental strain was unceasing ; tonight , the storm was taxing cerebral effort to its limit . A controller 's nightmare was to " lose the picture , " a situation where an overtaxed brain rebelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the best . Keith had been the best . Until a year ago , he was one whom colleagues turned to when pressures built to unreason . Keith , I 'm getting swamped . Can you take a couple ? He always had . But , lately , roles had changed . Now , colleagues shielded him as best they could , though there was a limit to how much any man could help another and do his own job , too . More radio instructions were needed . Keith was on his own ; Tevis , the supervisor , had propelled himself and his high stool across the room to check another controller . Keith 's mind clicked out decisions . Turn Braniff left , Air Canada right , Eastern through a hundred and eighty degrees . It was done ; on the radar screen , blips were changing direction . The slower-moving Lake Central Convair could be left another minute . Not so , the Swissair jet , it was converging with Eastern . Swissair must be given a new course immediately , but what ? Think fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then right again . Keep an eye on TWA and Northwest ! A new flight coming in from the west at high speed  --  identify , and find more airspace . Concentrate , concentrate ! Keith determined grimly : He would not lose the picture ; not tonight , not now . There was a reason for not doing so ; a secret he had shared with no one , not even Natalie , his wife . Only Keith Bakersfeld , and Keith alone , knew that this was the last time he would everAIRPORTface a radarscope or stand a watch . Today was his last day with air traffic control . It would be over soon . It was also the last day of his life . " Take a break , Keith . " It was the tower watch chief 's voice . Keith had not seen the tower chief come in . He had done so unobtrusively , and was standing by Wayne Tevis , the radar supervisor . A moment earlier , Tevis had told the tower chief quietly , " Keith 's all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he seemed to pull together . " Tevis was glad he had not had to take the drastic action he had contemplated earlier , but the tower chief murmured , " Let 's take him off a while , anyway " ; and , as an afterthought , " I 'll do it . " Glancing at the two men together , Keith knew at once why he was being relieved . There was still a crisis , and they did n't trust him . The work break was a pretext ; he was n't due for one for halfan-hour . Should he protest ? For a controller as senior as himself , it was an indignity which others would notice . Then he thought : Why make an issue now ? It was n't worth it . Besides , a ten-minute break would steady him . Afterward , when the worst of the emergency was over , he could return to work for the remainder of his shift . Wayne Tevis leaned forward . " Lee will take over , Keith . " He motioned to another controller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scheduled one . Keith nodded , without comment , though he remained in place and continued to give radio instructions to aircraft while the new man got the picture . It usually took several minutes for one controller to hand over to another . The man coming in had to study the radar display , letting the over-all situation build in his mind . He also needed to become mentally tensed . Getting tensed  --  consciously and deliberately  --  was a part of the job . Controllers called it " sharpening to an edge , " and in Keith 's fifteen years in air traffic control , he had watched it happen regularly , to others and to himself . You did it , because you had to , when you took over a duty , as now . At other times it became a reflex action , such as when controllers drove to work together  --  in car pools , as some did . On leaving home , conversation would be relaxed and normal . At that point in the journey , a casual question like , " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elicit an equally casual798o AIRPORTanswer  --  " Sure am , " or " No , I ca n't make it this week . " Yet , nearing the job , conversation tautened , so that the same question  --  a quarter mile from the airport  --  might produce a terse " affirmative " or " negative , " and nothing more . Coupled with tense mental sharpness was another requirement  --  a controlled , studied calmness at all times on duty . The two requirements  --  contradictoryin terms of human nature  --  were exhausting mentally and , in the long run , took a toll . Many controllers developed stomach ulcers which they concealed through fear of losing their jobs . As part of the concealment , they paid for private medical advice instead of seeking free medical help to which their employmententitled them . At work , they hid bottles of Maalox  --  " for the relief of gastric hyperacidity "  --  in their lockers and , at intervals , sipped the white , sweetish fluid surreptitiously . There were other effects . Some controllers  --  Keith Bakersfeld knew several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into rages , as a reaction to pent-up emotions at work . Coupled with irregular hours of working and sleeping , which made it difficult to regulate a household , the effect was predictable . Among air traffic controllers , the list of broken homes was long , divorce rates high . " Okay , " the new man said . " I have the picture . " Keith slid out from his seat , disconnecting his headset as the relieving controller took his place . Even before the newcomer was seated , he had begun transmitting fresh instructions to the lower TWA . The tower chief told Keith , " Your brother said he might drop around later . " Keith nodded as he left the radar room . He felt no resentment against the tower chief , who had his own responsibilities to contend with , and Keith was glad he had made no protest about being relieved prematurely . More than anything else at the moment , Keith wanted a cigarette , some coffee , and to be alone . He was also glad  --  now the decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emergency situation . He had been involved in too many in the past to regret missing the culmination of one more . Air traffic emergencies of one kind or another occurred several times a day at Lincoln International , as they did at any major airport . They could happen in any kind of weather  --  on the clearest day , as well as during a storm like tonight 's . Usually , only a few peopleAIRPORT 81knew about such incidents , because almost all were resolved safely , and even pilots in the air were seldom told the reason for delays or abrupt instructions to turn this way or that . For one thing , there was no need for them to know ; for another , there was never time for radio small talk . Ground emergency staffs  --  crash crews , ambulance attendants , and police  --  as well as airport senior management , were always alerted , and the action they took depended on the category of emergency declared . Category one was the most serious , but was rarely invoked , since it signaled an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to life , or physical damage . Category three , as now , was a general warning to airport emergency facilities to stand by ; they might be needed , or they might not . For controllers , however , any type of emergency involved additional pressures and aftereffects . Keith entered the controllers ' locker room which adjoined the radar control room . Now that he had a few minutes to think more calmly , he hoped , for the sake of everyone , that the Air Force KC-135 pilot , and all others in the air tonight , made it safely down through the storm . The locker room , a small cubicle with a single window , had three walls of metal lockers , and a wooden bench down the center . A notice board beside the window held an untidy collection of official bulletins and notices from airport social groups . An unshaded light bulb in the ceiling seemed dazzling after the radar room 's semidarkness . No one else was in the locker room , and Keith reached for the light switch and turned it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough light came in for him to see . He lit a cigarette . Then , opening his locker , he took out the lunch pail which Natalie had packed before his departure from home this afternoon . As he poured coffee from a Thermos , he wondered if Natalie had put a note in with his meal , or , if not a note , some inconsequential item she had clipped from a newspaper or a magazine . She often did one or both , hoping , he supposed , that it might cheer him . She had worked hard at doing that , right from the beginning of his trouble . At first , she had used obvious means ; then , when those had n't worked , less obvious ones , though Keith had always realized  --  in a detached , dispassionate kind of way  --  exactly what Natalie was doing , or trying to . More recently , there had been fewer notes and clippings. 8z AIRPORT Perhaps Natalie , too , had finally lost heart . She had had less to say lately , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were times she had been crying . Keith had wanted to help her when he saw it . But how could he  --  when he could n't help himself ? A picture of Natalie was taped to the inside of his locker door  --  a snapshot , in color , which Keith had taken . He had brought it here three years ago . Now , the light from outside shone on the picture only dimly , but he knew it so well , he could see what was there , whether highlighted or not . The picture showed Natalie in a bikini . She was seated on a rock , laughing , one slim hand held above her eyes to shield them from the sun . Her light brown hair streamed behind ; her small , pert face showed the freckles which always appeared in summer . There was an impudent , pixyish quality to Natalie Bakersfeld , as well as strength of will , and the camera had caught both . In the rear of the picture was a blue water lake , high firs , and a rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada , camping among the Haliburton lakes , and for once their children , Brian and Theo , had been left behind in Illinois , with Mel and Cindy . The holiday proved to be one of the happier times that Keith and Natalie had ever known . Perhaps , Keith thought , it was n't a bad thing to be remembering it tonight . Pushed in behind the photo was a folded paper . It was one of the notes he had been thinking about , which Natalie put occasionally in his lunch pail . This was one from a few months ago which , for some reason , he had saved . Though knowing what was there , he took the paper out and walked to the window to read . It was a clipping from a news magazine , with some lines below in his wife 's handwriting . Natalie had all kinds of odd interests , some far-ranging , which she encouraged Keith and the boys to share . This clipping was about continuing experiments , by U.S. geneticists . Human sperm , it re- ported , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a deep freeze for storage where it remained in good condition indefinitely . When thawed , it could be used for fertilization of women at any time  --  either soon or generations hence . Natalie had written : The Ark could have been 50 percent smaller , if Noah Had known the facts about frozen spermatazoa ; It appears you can have babies by the scoreMerely by opening a refrigerator door . I 'm glad we had our rationWith love and passion . She had been trying then ; still trying desperately to return their lives . . . the two of them ; and as a family . . . to the way they had been before . With love and passion . Mel had joined forces , too , attempting with Natalie , to induce his brother to fight free from the tide-race of anguish and depression which engulfed him totally . Even then a part of Keith had wanted to respond . Summoning , from some deep consciousness , a spark of spirit , he had sought to match their strength by drawing on his own ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effort failed . It failed  --  as he had known it would  --  because there was no feeling or emotion left within himself . Neither warmth , nor love , nor even anger to be kindled . Only bleakness , remorse , and all-enveloping despair . Natalie realized their failure now ; he was sure of that . It was the reason , he suspected , that she had been crying , somewhere out of sight . And Mel ? Perhaps Mel , too , had given up . Though not entirely  --  Keith remembered what the tower chief had told him . " Your brother said he might drop around . . . " It would be simpler if Mel did n't . Keith felt unequal to the effort , even though they had been as close as brothers could be all their lives . Mel 's presence might be complicating . Keith was too drained , too weary , for complications any more . He wondered again if Natalie had put in a note with his meal tonight . He took out the contents of the lunch pail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watercress sandwiches , a container of cottage cheese , a pear , and wrapping paper . Nothing more . Now that he knew there was none , he wished desperately there had been some message ; any message , even the most trifling . Then he realized  --  it was his own fault ; there had been no time . Today , because of the preparations he needed to make , he had left home84 AIRPORTearlier than usual . Natalie , to whom he had given no advance warning , had been rushed . At one point , he had suggested not taking a lunch at all ; he would get a meal , he said , at one of the airport cafeterias . But Natalie , who knew the cafeterias would be crowded and noisy , which Keith disliked , had said no , and gone ahead as quickly as she could . She had not asked why he wanted to leave early , though he knew she was curious . Keith was relieved that there had been no question . If there had been , he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted the last words between them to have been a lie . As it was , there had been enough time . He had driven to the airport business area and registered at the O'Hagan Inn where , earlier in the day , he had made a reservation by telephone . He had planned everything carefully , using a plan worked out several weeks ago , though he had waited  --  giving himself time to think about it , and be sure  --  before putting the plan into effect . After checking into his room , he had left the Inn and arrived at the airport in time to go on duty . The O'Hagan Inn was within a few minutes ' drive of Lincoln International . In a few hours from now , when Keith 's duty watch was ended , he could go there quickly . The room key was in his pocket . He took it out to check. 10The information  --  which the tower watch chief had relayed earlier to Mel Bakersfeld  --  about a meeting of Meadowood citizenry , was entirely accurate . The meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  fifteen seconds , as a jet flies , from the end of runwaytwo five  --  had been in session half-an-hour . Its proceedings had started later than planned , since most of the six hundred adults who were present had had to battle their way , in cars and on foot , through deep snow . But somehow they had come . It was a mixed assemblage , such as might be found in any averagely prosperous dormitory community . Of the men , some were mediumlevelexecutives , others artisans , with a sprinkling of local tradespeople . In numbers , men and women were approximately equal . AIRPORT 85Since it was Friday night , the beginning of a weekend , most were casually dressed , though exceptions were half a dozen visitors from outside the community and several press reporters . The Sunday school hall was now uncomfortably crowded , stuffy and smoke-filled . All available chairs were occupied , and at least a hundred people were standing . That so many had turned out at all on such a night , leaving warm homes to do so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , at the moment , unanimously angry . The anger  --  almost as tangible as the tobacco smoke  --  had two sources . First was the long-standing bitterness with the airport 's byproduct  --  thethunderous , ear-assaulting noise of jet propulsion which assailed the homes of Meadowood , day and night , shattering peace and privacy , both waking and sleeping . Second was the immediate frustration that , through a large part of the meeting so far , those assembled had been unable to hear one another . Some difficulty in hearing had been anticipated . After all , it was what the meeting was about , and a portable p.a. system had been borrowed from the church . What had not been expected , however , was that tonight jet aircraft would be taking off immediately overhead , rendering both human ears and the p.a. system useless . The cause , which the meeting neither knew nor cared about , was that runway three zero was blocked by the mired Aereo-Mexican 707 , and other aircraft were being instructed to use runway two five instead . The latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas runway three zero , when usable , at least routed takeoffs slightly to one side . In a momentary silence the chairman , red-faced , shouted , " Ladies and gentlemen , for years we have tried reasoning with the airport management and the airline companies . We have pointed to the violation of our homes . We have proved , with independent testimony , that normal living  --  under the barrage of noise we are forced to endure  --  is impossible . We have pleaded that our very sanity is in danger and that our wives , our children , and ourselves live on the edge of nervous breakdowns , which some among us have suffered already . " The chairman was a heavy-jowled , balding man named Floyd Zanetta , who was a printing firm manager and Meadowood home-86 AIRPORTowner . Zanetta , sixtyish , was prominent in community affairs , and in the lapel of his sports jacket was a Kiwanis long-service badge . Both the chairman and an impeccably dressed younger man were on a small raised platform at the front of the hall . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer . A black leather briefcasestood open at his side . Floyd Zanetta slammed a hand on the lectern in front of him . " What do the airport and airlines do ? I 'll tell you what they do . They pretend ; pretend to listen . And while they are pretending , they make promises and more promises which they have no intention of fulfilling . The airport management , the FAA , and the airlines are cheats and liars ... " The word " liars " was lost . It was engulfed in a shattering , almost unbelievable crescendo of sound , a monstrous roar of power which seemed to seize the building and shake it . As if protectively , many in the hall covered their ears . A few glanced upward nervously . Others , their eyes transmitting anger , spoke heatedly to those beside them , though only a lip reader could have known what was said ; no words were audible . A water pitcher near the chairman 's lectern trembled . If Zanetta had not grasped it quickly , it would have fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had begun and built , the roar lessened and faded . Already miles away and several thousand feet above , Flight 58 of Pan American was climbing through storm and darkness , reaching for higher , clearer altitudes , swinging onto course for Frankfurt , Germany . Now , Continental Airlines 23 , destination Denver , Colorado , was rolling on the farther end of runway two five , cleared for takeoff  --  over Meadowood . Other flights , already in line on an adjoiningtaxiway , were waiting their turn to follow . It had been the same way all evening , even before the Meadowoodmeeting started . And after it started , business had had to be conducted in brief intervals between the overwhelming din of takeoffs . Zanetta continued hastily , " I said they are cheats and liars . What is happening here and now is conclusive evidence . At the very least we are entitled to noise abatement procedures , but tonight even this .. . " " Mr. Chairman , " a woman 's voice cut in from the body of the hall , " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and going over it againAIRPORT 87wo n't change anything . " All eyes had turned to the woman , who was now standing . She had a strong , intelligent face and shoulderlengthbrown hair which had fallen forward , so that she brushed it back impatiently . " What I want to know , and so do others , is what else can we do , and where do we go from here ? " There was an outburst of applause , and cheering . Zanetta said irritably , " If you 'll kindly let me finish ... " He never did . Once again , the same encompassing roar dominated the Sunday school hall . The timing , and the last remark , provided the only laughter , so far , of the evening . Even the chairman grinned ruefully as he raised his hands in a despairing gesture . A man 's voice called peevishly , " Get on with it ! " Zanetta nodded agreement . He continued speaking , picking his way  --  like a climber over rocks  --  between recurring peaks of sound from overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared , was to discard politeness and reasonable approaches to the airport authority and others . Instead , a purely legalistic attack must be the order from now on . The residents of Meadowood were citizens with legal rights , which were being infringed upon . Along with those legal rights went recourse to the courts ; therefore , they must be prepared to fight in the courts , with toughness , even viciousness if necessary . As to what form a legalistic offensive should take , it so happened that a noted lawyer , Mr. Elliott Freemantle , whose offices were downtownin the Loop , had consented to be present at the meeting . Mr. Freemantle had made a study of laws affecting excessive noise , privacy and airspace , and , very soon , those who had braved the weather to attend would have the pleasure of hearing this distinguishedgentleman . He would , in fact , present a proposal .. . As the cliches rolled on , Elliott Freemantle fidgeted . He passed a hand lightly over his barber-styled , gray-streaked hair , fingering the smoothness of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting  --  and his keen sense of smell confirmed that the exclusiveface lotion , which he always used after shaving and sunlampsessions , still lingered . He recrossed his legs , observing that his two-hundred dollar alligator shoes still gleamed with mirror clearness , and was careful not to spoil the crease in the trousers of his tailored Blue Spruce pebble-weave suit . Elliott Freemantle had long ago88 AIRPORTdiscovered that people preferred their lawyers  --  unlike their doctors  --  to look prosperous . Prosperity in a lawyer conveyed an aura of success at the bar , success which those about to engage in litigation wanted for themselves . Elliott Freemantle hoped that most of those in the hall would shortly become litigants , and that he would represent them . Meanwhile , he wished the old cluck of a chairman , Zanetta , would get the hell off his feet so that he , Freemantle , could take over . There was no surer way to lose the confidence of an audience , or a jury , than by letting them think faster than yourself , so that they became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it . Freemantle'sfinely honed intuition told him this was what was happeningnow . It meant that when his own turn came , he would have to work that much harder to establish his competence and superior intellect . Some among his legal colleagues might have questioned if Elliott Freemantle 's intellect was , in fact , superior . They might even have objected to the chairman 's description of him as a gentleman . Fellow lawyers sometimes regarded Freemantle as an exhibitionist who commanded high fees mainly through a showman 's instinct for attracting attention . It was conceded , though , that he had an enviable knack for latching early onto causes which later proved spectacular and profitable . For Elliott Freemantle , the Meadowood situation seemed custom made . He had read about the community 's problem and promptly arranged , through contacts , to have his name suggested to several homeownersas the one lawyer who could most likely help them . As a result , a homeowners committee eventually approached him , and the fact that they did so , rather than the other way around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning . Meanwhile , he had made a superficial study of the law , and recent court decisions , affecting noise and privacy  --  a subject entirely new to him  --  and when the committee arrived , he addressed them with the assurance of a lifetime expert . Later , he had made the proposition which resulted in this meetingtonight , and his own attendance . Thank God ! It looked as if Zanetta , the chairman , was finallythrough with his windy introduction . Banal to the last , he was intoning , " . . . and so it is my privilege and pleasure to present . . . " Scarcely waiting for his name to be spoken , Elliott Freemantle bounded to his feet . He began speaking before Zanetta 's buttocks had made contact with his chair . As usual , he dispensed with all preliminaries . " If you are expecting sympathy from me , you can leave right now , because there wo n't be any . You wo n't get it at this session , or others we may have later . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need them , I suggest you get your own , or supply each other . My business is law . Law , and nothing else . " He had deliberately made his voice harsh , and he knew he had jolted them , as he intended to . He had also seen the newspaper reporters look up and pay attention . There were three of them at the press table near the front of the hall  --  two young men from the big city dailies and an elderly woman from a local weekly . All were important to his plans , and he had taken the trouble to find out their names and speak to them briefly before the meeting started . Now , their pencils were racing . Good ! Cooperation with the press always ranked high in any project of Elliott Freemantle 's , and he knew from experience that the best way to achieve it was by providing a lively story with a fresh angle . Usually he succeeded . Newspaper people appreciated that  --  a lot more than free drinks or food  --  and the livelier and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inclined to be . He returned his attention to the audience . Only a shade less aggressively , he continued , " If we decide , between us , that I am to represent you , it will be necessary for me to ask you questions about the effect of airport noise on your homes , your families , your own physical and mental health . But do not imagine I shall be asking the questions because I care personally about these things , or you as individuals . Frankly , I do n't . You may as well know that I am an extremely selfish man . If I ask these questions , it will be to discover to what extent wrong has been done you under the law . I am already convinced that some wrong has been done  --  perhaps considerable wrong  --  and , in that event , you are entitled to legal redress . But you may as well know that whatever I learn , and however deeply I become involved , I am not given to losing sleep about the welfare of my clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 91or the courts . But . . . " Freemantle paused dramatically , and stabbed a finger forward to underscore his words . " But , in my office and in the courts , as clients , you would have the utmost of my attention and ability , on questions of law . And on those occasions , if we work together , I promise you will be glad I am on your side and not against you . " Now he had the attention of everyone in the hall . Some , both men and women , were sitting forward in their chairs , striving not to miss any words as he paused  --  though for the minimum time  --  as aircraft continued overhead . A few faces had become hostile as he spoke , but not many . It was time , though , to relax the pressure a little . He gave a swift , short smile , then went on seriously . " I inform you of these things so that we understand each other . Some people tell me that I am a mean , unpleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever I want a lawyer for myself I 'll make sure of choosing someone who is mean and unpleasant , also tough  --  on my behalf . " There were a few approving nods and smiles . " Of course , if you want a nicer guy who 'll hand you more sympathy , though maybe a bit less law "  --  Elliott Freemantle shrugged  --  " that 's your privilege . " He had been watching the audience closely and saw a responsiblelookingman , in heavy rimmed glasses , lean toward a woman and whisper . From their expressions , Freemantle guessed the man was saying , " This is more like it !  --  what we wanted to hear . " The woman , probably the whisperer 's wife , nodded agreement . Around the hall , other faces conveyed the same impression . As usual on occasions like this , Elliott Freemantle had shrewdly judged the temper of the meeting and calculated his own approach . He sensed early that these people were weary of platitudes and sympathy  --  well-meaning but ineffective . His own words , blunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , before minds could relax and attention wander , he must take a new tack . The moment for specifics had arrived  --  tonight , for this group , a discourse on the law of noise . The trick to holding audience attention , at which Elliott Freemantle excelled , was to stay half a mental pace ahead ; that much and no more , so that those listening could follow what was being said , but must remain sufficiently alert to do so . " Pay attention , " he commanded , " because I 'm going to talk about your particular problem . " The law of noise , he declared , was increasingly under study by the nation 's courts . Old concepts were changing . New court decisions were establishing that excessive noise could be an invasion of privacy as well as trespass on property rights . Moreover , courts were in a mood to grant injunctions and financial recompense where intrusion  --  including aircraft intrusion  --  could be proven . Elliott Freemantle paused while another takeoff thundered overhead , then gestured upward . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " At the press table , all three reporters made a note . The United States Supreme Court , he went on , had already set a precedent . In U.S. v. Causby the court ruled that a Greensboro , North Carolina , chicken farmer was entitled to compensation because of " invasion " by military planes flying low above his house . In handing down the Causby decision , Mr. Justice William O. Douglas had stated , " . . . if the landowner is to have full enjoyment of the land , he must have exclusive control of the immediate reaches of the enveloping atmosphere . " In another case reviewed by the Supreme Court , Griggs v. County of Allegheny , a similar principle was upheld . In state courts of Oregon and Washington , in Thornburgv . Port of Portland and Martin v. Port of Seattle , damages for excessive aircraft noise had been awarded , even though airspace directly above the plaintiffs had not been violated . Other communitieshad begun , or were contemplating , similar legal action , and some were employing sound trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trucks took decibel readings of noise ; the cameras recorded aircraft altitudes . The noise frequently proved greater , the altitudes lower , than airlines and airport management admitted . In Los Angeles , a homeowner had filed suit against L. A. International Airport , asserting that the airport , by permitting landingson a newly extended runway close to his home , had taken an easement on his property without due process of law . The homeownerwas claiming ten thousand dollars which he believed to be equivalent to the decrease in value of his home . Elsewhere , more and more similar cases were being argued in the courts . The recital was succinct and impressive . Mention of a specific sum  --  ten thousand dollars  --  evoked immediate interest , as Elliott Freemantle intended that it should . The entire presentation sounded authoritative , factual , and the product of years of study . Only Free-92 AIRPORT AIRPORT 93mantle himself knew that his " facts " were the result , not of poring over law reports , but of two hours , the previous afternoon , spent studying newsclippings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts which he had failed to mention . The chicken farmer ruling of the Supreme Court was made more than twenty years earlier , and total damages awarded were a trifling three hundred and seventy-five dollars  --  the actual value of some dead chickens . The Los Angeles suit was merely a claim which had not yet come to trial and might never do so . A more significant case , Batten v. U.S. , on which the Supreme Court had ruled as recently as 1963 , Elliott Freemantle knew about but conveniently ignored . In Batten , the court accepted that only an actual " physical invasion " could create liability ; noise alone did not do so . Since , at Meadowood , there had been no such invasion , the Batten precedent meant that if a legal case was launched , it might well be lost before it was begun . But lawyer Freemantle had no wish for this to be known , at least not yet ; nor was he overly concerned whether a case , if brought to court , might eventually be won or lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients  --  at a whopping fee . On the subject of fee , he had already counted the house and done some mental arithmetic . The result delighted him . Of six hundred people in the hall , he estimated that five hundred , probably more , were Meadowood property owners . Allowing for the presence of husbands and wives together , it meant there was a minimum of two hundred and fifty prospective clients . If each of those two hundred and fifty could be persuaded to sign a one hundred dollar retainer agreement  --  which Elliott Freemantle hoped they would before the evening was over  --  a total fee in excess of twenty-five thousand dollars seemed decidedly within reach . On other occasions he had managed precisely the same thing . It was remarkable what you could accomplish with audacity , particularlywhen people were white hot in pursuing their own interests . An ample supply of printed retainer forms was in his bag . This memorandum of agreement between hereinafter known as plaintiff/s and Freemantle and Sye , attorneys at law .. . who will undertake plaintiff/s legal representation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aircraft use of the Lincoln International Airport facility . . . Plaintiff /s agrees to pay the said Freemantle and Sye one hundred dollars , in four installments oftwenty-five dollars , the first installment now due and payable , the balance quarterly on demand . . . Further , if the suit is successful Freemantle and Sye will receive ten percent of the gross amount of any damages awarded .. . The ten percent was a long shot because it was highly unlikely that there would ever be any damages to collect . Just the same , strange things sometimes happened in law , and Elliott Freemantle believed in covering all bases . " I have informed you of the legal background , " he asserted . " Now I intend to give you some advice . " He flashed one of his rare , quick smiles . " This advice will be a free sample , but  --  like toothpaste  --  any subsequent tubes will have to be paid for . " There was a responsive laugh which he cut off brusquely with a gesture . " My advice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Action now . " The remark produced handclapping and more nods of approval . There was a tendency , he continued , to regard legal proceedings as automatically slow and tedious . Often that was true , but on occasions , if determination and legal skill were used , the law could be harried along . In the present instance , legal action should be begun at once , before airlines and airport , by perpetuation of noise over a period of years , could claim custom and usage . As if to underline the point , still another aircraft thundered overhead . Before its sound could die , Elliott Freemantle shouted , " So I repeat  --  my advice to you is wait no longer ! You should act tonight . Now ! " Near the front of the audience , a youngish man in an alpaca cardigan and hopsack slacks sprang to his feet . " By God !  --  tell us how we start . " " You start  --  if you want to  --  by retaining me as your legal counsel . " There was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want to . " The chairman , Floyd Zanetta , was now on his feet again , waiting for the shouting to subside . He appeared pleased . Two of the reportershad craned around and were observing the obvious enthusiasmthroughout the hall . The third reporter  --  the elderly woman from the local weekly  --  looked up at the platform with a friendly smile . It had worked , as Elliott Freemantle had known it would . The rest , he realized , was merely routine . Within the next half hour94 AIRPORTa good many of the retainer blanks in his bag would be signed , while others would be taken home , talked over , and most likely mailed tomorrow . These people were not afraid of signing papers , or of legal procedures ; they had become accustomed to both in purchasing their homes . Nor would a hundred dollars seem an excessive sum ; a few might even be surprised that the figure was that low . Only a handful would bother doing the mental arithmetic which Elliot Freemantle had done himself , and even if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue that the fee was justified by responsibility for the large numbers involved . Besides , he would give them value for their money  --  a good show , with fireworks , in court and elsewhere . He glanced at his watch ; better get on . Now that his own involvement was assured , he wanted to cement the relationship by staging the first act of a drama . Like everything else so far , it was something he had already planned and it would gain attention  --  much more than this meeting  --  in tomorrow'snewspapers . It would also confirm to these people that he meant what he said about not wasting any time . The actors in the drama would be the residents of Meadowood , here assembled , and he hoped that everyone present was prepared to leave this hall and to stay out late . The scene would be the airport . The time : tonight. 11At approximately the same time that Elliott Freemantle was savoring success , an embittered , thwarted , former building contractor named D. O. Guerrero was surrendering to failure . Guerrero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a locked room of a shabby walk-up apartment on the city 's South Side . The apartment was over a noisome , greasy-spoon lunch counter on 51st Street , not far from the stockyards . D. O. Guerrero was a gaunt , spindly man , slightly stoop-shouldered , with a sallow face and protruding , narrow jaw . He had deep-set eyes , pale thin lips , and a slight sandy mustache . His neck was scrawny , with a prominent Adam 's apple . His hairline was receding . He had nervous hands , and his fingers were seldom still . He smokedAIRPORT 95constantly , usually lighting a fresh cigarette from the stub of the last . At the moment he needed a shave and a clean shirt , and was perspiring , even though the room in which he had locked himself was cold . His age was fifty ; he looked several years older . Guerrero was married , and had been for eighteen years . By some standards , the marriage was good , if unspectacular . D.O . ( through most of his life he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other equably , and the idea of coveting some other partner seemed not to occur to them . D. O. Guerrero , in any case , had never been greatly interested in women ; business , and financial maneuvering , occupied his thoughts far more . But in the past year , a mental gulf had opened between the Guerreros which Inez , though she tried , was unable to bridge . It was one result of a series of business disasters which reduced them from comparative affluence to near poverty , and eventually forced a succession of moves  --  first from their comfortable and spacious , if heavily mortgaged , suburban home to other quarters less pretentious , and later still to this seamy , drafty , cockroach-infested , two-room apartment . Even though Inez Guerrero did not enjoy their situation , she might have made the best of it if her husband had not become increasingly moody , savagely bad tempered , and at times impossible to talk with . A few weeks ago , in a rage , he had struck Inez , bruising her face badly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither apologize nor discuss the incident later . She feared more violence and , soon after , sent their two teen-age children  --  a boy and a girl  --  to stay with her married sister in Cleveland . Inez herself stayed on , taking a job as a coffee-house waitress , and although the work was hard and the pay small , it at least provided money for food . Her husband seemed scarcely to notice the children 's absence , or her own ; his mood recently had been a deep and selfcontaineddejection . Inez was now at her job . D. O. Guerrero was in the apartment alone . He need not have locked the door of the small bedroom where he was occupied , but had done so as an added guarantee of privacy , even though he would not be there for long . Like others this night , D. O. Guerrero would shortly leave for the airport . He held a confirmed reservation , plus a validated ticket  --  for tonight  --  on Trans America Flight Two to Rome . At this moment , 96 AIRPORTthe ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the locked room , slung over a rickety wooden chair . Inez Guerrero had no knowledge of the ticket to Rome , nor did she have the slightest inkling of her husband 's motive in obtaining it . The Trans America ticket was for a round trip excursion which normally cost four hundred and seventy-four dollars . However , by lying , D. O. Guerrero had obtained credit . He paid forty-seven dollars down , acquired by pawning his wife 's last possession of any value  --  her mother 's ring ( Inez had not yet missed it )  --  and promised to remit the balance , plus interest , in monthly installments over the next two years . It was highly unlikely that the promise would ever be fulfilled . No self-respecting finance company or bank would have loaned D. O. Guerrero the price of a bus ticket to Peoria , leave alone an airline fare to Rome . They would have investigated his backgroundthoroughly , and discovered he had a long history of insolvency , a parcel of long-standing personal debts , and that his homebuildingcompany , Guerrero Contracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An even closer check into Guerrero 's tangled finances might have disclosed that during the past eight months  --  using his wife 's name  --  he had attempted to raise capital for a speculative land deal , but failed to do so . In course of this failure he incurred even more debts . Now , because of certain fraudulent statements , as well as being an undischarged bankrupt , exposure , which seemed imminent , would involve criminal prosecution and almost certainly a prison term . Slightly less serious , but just as immediate , was the fact that the rent of this apartment , wretched as it was , was three weeks overdue , and the landlord had threatened eviction tomorrow . If evicted , they would have nowhere else to go . D. O. Guerrero was desperate . His financial rating was minus zero . Airlines , though , were notably easygoing about extending credit ; also , if a debt went sour they were usually less tough in collection procedures than other agencies . This was calculated policy . It was based on the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves an unusually honest cross-section of society , and bad debt losses of most airlines were remarkably low . Deadbeats likeAIRPORT 97D . O. Guerrero troubled them rarely ; therefore they were not geared  --  because it was not worth while  --  to defeat the kind of subterfuge he had used . He avoided , by two simple means , more than a cursory credit investigation . First , he produced an " employer 's reference " which he had typed himself on the letterhead of a defunct company he once operated ( not the bankrupt one ) , the company 's address being his own post office box . Second , in typing the letter he deliberately misspelled his surname , changing the initial from " G " to " B , " so that a routine consumer credit check of " Buerrero " would produce no information , instead of the harmful data recorded under his correctname . For further identification he used his Social Security card and driver 's license , on both of which he carefully changed the same initial beforehand , and had since changed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that his signature on the time payment contract was indecipherable , so it was not clear whether he had signed " G " or " B. " The misspelling was perpetuated by the clerk who yesterday made out his airline ticket in the name of " D. O. Buerrero , " and D. O. Guerrero had weighed this carefully in light of his immediate plans . He decided not to worry . If any query was raised afterward , the error of a single letter , both on the " employer 's reference " and the ticket , would appear to be a genuine mistake . There was nothing to prove he had arranged it deliberately . In any case , when checking in at the airport later tonight , he intended to have the spelling corrected  --  on the Trans America flight manifest as well as on his ticket . It was important , once he was aboard , to be sure there was no confusion about his correct identity . That was part of his plan , too . Another part of D. O. Guerrero 's plan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would destroy himself along with it , a factor which did not deter him since his life , he reasoned , was no longer of value to himself or others . But his death could be of value , and he intended to make sure it was . Before departure of the Trans America flight , he would take out flight insurance for seventy-five thousand dollars , naming his wife and children as beneficiaries . He rationalized that he had done little for them until now , but his final act would be a single transcendent98 AIRPORTgesture on their behalf . He believed that what he was doing was a deed of love and sacrifice . In his warped , perverted mind  --  driven by desperation  --  he had given no thought to other passengers who would be aboard Flight Two , nor to the aircraft 's crew , all of whose deaths would accompany his own . With a psychopath 's total lack of conscience he had consideredothers only to the extent that they might circumvent his scheme . He believed he had anticipated all contingencies . The business about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route . No one could prove he had not intended to pay the installments he contracted for ; and even if the fake " employer 's reference " was exposed  --  as it probably would be  --  it demonstrated nothing except that he had obtained credit under false pretenses . That , in itself , would have no bearing on a subsequent insurance claim . Another thing was that he deliberately bought a round-trip ticket to create the appearance of not only intending to complete the outwardflight , but also to return . As to choosing a Rome flight , he had a second cousin in Italy whom he had never seen , but occasionally talked of visiting  --  a fact which Inez knew . So at least there would seem an element of logic to his choice . D. O. Guerrero had had his plan in mind for several months while his fortunes were worsening . During that time he studied carefully the histories of air disasters where airliners were destroyed by individuals seeking to profit from flight insurance . The number of instances was surprisingly large . In all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation and , where conspirators remained alive , they were charged with murder . The flight insurance policies of those involved had been invalidated . There was no means of knowing , of course , how many other disasters , where causes remained unknown , had been the result of sabotage . The key factor was the presence or absence of wreckage . Wherever wreckage was recovered , trained investigators pieced it together in an attempt to learn its secrets . They usually succeeded . If there was an explosion in mid-air , its traces remained , and the nature of the explosion could be determined . Therefore , D. O. Guerrero reasoned , his own plan must preclude the recovery of wreckage . AIRPORT 99This was the reason he had selected Trans America 's non-stop flight to Rome . A large portion of the journey of Flight Two  --  The Golden Argosy  --  was above ocean , where wreckage from a disintegrated airplanewould never be found . Using one of the airline 's own passenger brochures which convenientlyshowed air routes , aircraft speeds , and even had a feature called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours ' flying  --  allowing for average winds  --  Flight Two would be over mid-Atlantic . He intended to check the calculation and amend it , if necessary , as the journey progressed . He would do so , first by noting the exact time of takeoff , then by listening carefully to the announcements which captains always made over cabin p.a. systems about the aircraft 's progress . With the information it would be a simple matter to decide if the flight was behind schedule , or ahead , and by how much . Finally , at approximately a point he had already decided on  --  eight hundred miles east of Newfoundland  --  he would trigger an explosion . It would send the aircraft , or what remained of it , plummeting toward the sea . No wreckage could ever be found . The debris of Flight Two would remain forever , hidden and secret , on the Atlantic Ocean floor . There would be no examination , no later exposure of the cause of the aircraft 's loss . Those left might wonder , question , speculate ; they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Flight insurance claims  --  in the absence of any evidence of sabotage  --  would be settled in full . The single element on which everything else hinged was the explosion . Obviously it must be adequate to destroy the airplane , but  --  equally important  --  it must occur at the right time . For the second reason D. O. Guerrero had decided to carry the explosive device aboard and set it off himself . Now , within the locked bedroom , he was putting the device together , and despite his familiarity  --  as a building contractor  --  with explosives , was still sweating , as he had been since he started a quarter of an hour ago . There were five main components  --  three cartridges of dynamite , a tiny blasting cap with wires attached , and a single cell transistor radio battery . The dynamite cartridges were Du Pont Red Cross Extra  --  small but exceedingly powerful , containing forty percent nitro-zoo AIRPORT AIRPORTglycerin ; each was an inch and a quarter in diameter and eight inches long . They were taped together with black electrician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Ry-Krisp box , left open at one end . Guerrero had also laid out several other items , carefully , on the ragged coverlet of the bed where he was working . These were a wooden clothespin , two thumbtacks , a square inch of clear plastic , and a short length of string . Total value of the equipment which would destroy a six and a half million dollar airplane was less than five dollars . All of it , including the dynamite  --  a " leftover " from D. O. Guerrero 's days as a contractor  --  had been bought in hardware stores . Also on the bed was a small , flat attache case of the type in which businessmen carried their papers and books when traveling by air . It was in this that Guerrero was now installing the explosive apparatus . Later , he would carry the case with him on the flight . It was all incredibly simple . It was so simple , in fact , Guerrero thought to himself , that most people , lacking a knowledge of explosives , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would  --  with shattering , devastating deadliness . Into the end of one of the sticks of dynamite , he pressed a pencil , making a hole an inch and a half deep . He removed the pencil and inserted the blasting cap , which was the same diameter . Two insulated wires led from the blasting cap . Now , all that was necessary to explode the blasting cap and all three sticks of dynamite was to pass an electric current down the wires . He taped the Ry-Krisp box containing the dynamite securely in place inside the attache case . Close to it he fastened the wooden clothespin and the battery . The battery would fire the charge . The clothespin  --  the type with a metal spring  --  was the switch which , at the proper time , would release the current from the battery . He connected one wire from the blasting cap directly to a terminal of the battery . His hands were trembling . He could feel sweat , in rivulets , inside his shirt . With the blasting cap in place , one mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and most of the building , apart , here and now . He concentrated on the clothespin . On each side of the head of the clothespin  --  on the inside  --  Guerrero had pressed home a thumbtack . When the two thumbtackscame together through pressure of the clothespin spring , they would make an electrical connection . To prevent them coming together for the time being , he inserted an insulator between them  --  the small piece of clear plastic . He held his breath as he connected the second wire from the blasting cap and dynamite to one of the thumbtacks on the clothespin . Both wires from the dynamite were now in place . He waited , aware of his heart pounding , using a handkerchief to wipe moisture from his hands . His nerves , his senses , were on edge . Beneath him , as he sat on the bed , he could feel the thin , lumpy mattress . The decrepit iron bedstead screeched a protest as he moved . He resumed working . With exquisite caution , he connected a short length of wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to the second thumbtack on the clothespin . Now , only the square inch of clear plastic , which held the two thumbtacks apart , was preventing the passage of an electric current and thereby an explosion . The plastic , less than a sixteenth of an inch thick , had a small hole near its outer edge . D. O. Guerrero took the last item left on the bed  --  the string  --  and passed one end through the hole in the plastic , then tied it securely , being cautious not to move the plastic . The other end of the string he pushed through an inconspicuous hole , already drilled , which went through to the outside of the attache case , emerging under the carrying handle . Leaving the string fairly loose inside the case , on the outside he tied a second knot , large enough to prevent the string from slipping back . Finally  --  also on the outside  --  he made a finger-size loop , like a miniature hangman 's noose , and cut off the surplus string . And that was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the string ! Inside the case , the piece of plastic would fly out from the head of the clothespin , and the thumbtacks would connect . The electric current would flow , and the explosion would be instant , devastating , final , for whomeveror whatever was nearby . Now that it was done , Guerrero relaxed and lit a cigarette . He smiled sardonically as he reflected again on how much more complicatedthe public  --  including writers of detective fiction  --  imagined the manufacture of a bomb to be . In stories he had read there were always elaborate mechanisms , clocks , fuses , which ticked or hissed1oz AIRPORTor spluttered , and which could be circumvented if immersed in water . In reality , no complications were required  --  only the simple , homely components he had just put together . Nor could anything stop the detonation of his kind of bomb  --  neither water , bullets , nor bravery  --  once the string was pulled . Holding the cigarette between his lips , and squinting through its smoke , D. O. Guerrero put some papers carefully into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wires , battery , and string . He made sure the papers would not move around , but that the string could move freely under them . Even if he opened the case for any reason , its contents would appear innocent . He closed the case and locked it . He checked the cheap alarm clock beside the bed ; his own watch had long since disappeared into a pawnshop . It was a few minutes after 8 P.M. , a little less than two hours to flight departure time . Time to go . He would take the subway uptown to the airline terminal , then board an airport bus . He had just enough money left for that , and to buy the flight insurance policy . The thought reminded him that he must allow sufficient time at the airport to get insurance . He pulled on his topcoat quickly , checking that the ticket to Rome was still in the inside pocket . He unlocked the bedroom door and went into the mean , shabby living room , taking the attache case with him , holding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Inez . He found a scrap of paper and a pencil and , after thinking for several seconds , wrote : I wo n't be home for a few days . I 'm going away . I expect to have some good news soon which will surprise you . He signed it D.O.For a moment he hesitated , softening . It was n't much of a note to mark the end of eighteen years of marriage . Then he decided it would have to do ; it would be a mistake to say too much . Afterward , even without wreckage from Flight Two , investigators would put the passenger list under a microscope . The note , as well as all other papers he had left , would be examined minutely . He put the note on a table where Inez would be sure to see it . As he went downstairs D. O. Guerrero could hear voices , and aAIRPORT 103jukebox playing , from the greasy-spoon lunch counter . He turned up the collar of his topcoat , with the other hand holding the attache case tightly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of string like a hangman 's noose was close to his curled fingers . Outside , as he left the South Side building and headed for the subway , it was still snowing . PART TWO8:30 P.M.-II P.M. ( CST ) 1Once more , Joe Patroni returned to the warmth of his car and telephoned the airport . The TWA maintenance chief reported that the road between himself and the airport was still blocked by the traffic accident which had delayed him , but the chances of getting through soon looked good . Was the Aereo-Mexican 707 , he inquired , still stuck in mud out on the airfield ? Yes , he was informed , it was ; furthermore , every few minutes , everyone concerned was calling TWA to ask where he was , and how much longer he would be , because his help was needed urgently . Without waiting to warm himself fully , Patroni left the car and hurried back down the highway , through the still falling snow and deep slush underfoot , to where the accident had occurred . At the moment , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a wide screen movie . The mammoth vehicle still lay on its side , blocking all four traffic lanes . By now it was completely snow covered and , with none of its wheels touching ground , seemed like a dead , rolled-over dinosaur . Floodlights and flares , aided by the whiteness of the snow , made the setting seem like day . The floodlights were on the three tow trucks which Patroni had urged sending for , and all had now arrived . The brilliant red flares had been planted by state police , of whom several more had appeared , and it seemed that when a state trooper lacked something to do , he lit another flare . As a result , the display of pyrotechnics was worthy of the Fourth of July . The arrival of a TV camera crew , a few minutes earlier , had heightened the stage effect . The self-important crew had come withrob AIRPORTblaring horn and illegal flashing beacon , driving down a shoulder of the road in a maroon station wagon blazoned WSHT . Typically , the four young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire event had been arranged for their convenience , and all further developments could now await their pleasure . Several state troopers , having ignored the illegal beacon on the station wagon , were engaged in waving the tow trucks from their present positions into new ones , as the TV men directed . Before he left to make his telephone call , Joe Patroni had carefully coaxed the tow trucks into locations which would give them the best leverage , together , to move the disabled tractor-trailer . As he left , the truck drivers and helpers were connecting heavy chains which he knew would take several more minutes to secure . The state police had been glad of his aid , and a burly police lieutenant , by that time in charge at the scene , had told the tow truck drivers to take their instructions from Patroni . But now , incredibly , the chains were removed , except for one which a grinning tow truck operator was handling as photofloods and a portable TV camera focused on him . Behind the camera and lights a crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from other blocked vehicles . Most were watching the TV filming interestedly , their earlier impatience and the cold bleak misery of the night apparently forgotten for the moment . A sudden gust of wind slapped icy wet snow into Joe Patroni 's face . Too late , his hand went to the neck of his parka . He felt some of the snow slide in , penetrate his shirt , and soak him miserably . Ignoring the discomfort , he strode toward the state police lieutenant and demanded , " Who in hell changed the trucks ? The way they 're lined now , you could n't move a peck of coondirt . All they 'll do is pull each other . " " I know , mister . " The lieutenant , tall , broad-shouldered , and towering above the short , stocky figure of Patroni , appeared fleetingly embarrassed . " But the TV guys wanted a better shot . They 're from a local station , and it 's for the news tonight  --  all about the storm . Excuse me . " One of the television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beckoning the lieutenant into the filming . The lieutenant , head up , and ignoring the falling snow , walked with brisk authority toward the tow truck which was the center of the film shot . Two stateAIRPORT 109troopers followed . The lieutenant , being careful to keep his face toward the camera , began giving instructions , with gestures , to the tow truck operator , instructions which were largely meaningless , but on screen would look impressive . The maintenance chief , remembering his need to get to the airport speedily , felt his anger rise . He braced himself to race out , grab the TV camera and lights , and smash them all . He could do it , too ; instinctively his muscles tightened , his breathing quickened . Then , with an effort , he controlled himself . A trait of character of Joe Patroni 's was a white-hot , violent temper ; fortunately the violent part was not easily set off , but once it was , all reason and logic deserted him . The exercise of control over his temper was something he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had not always succeeded , though nowadays a single memory helped . On one occasion he had failed to have control . The result , forever after , haunted him . In the Army Air Forces of World War II , Joe Patroni had been a redoubtable amateur boxer . He fought as a middleweight and , at one point , came within sight of the Air Forces championship , within his division , of the European Theater . In a bout staged in England shortly before the Normandy invasion , he had been matched against a crew chief named Terry O'Hale , a rough , tough Bostonian with a reputation for meanness in the ring , as well as out of it . Joe Patroni , then a young Pfc. aviation mechanic , knew O'Hale and disliked him . The dislike would not have mattered if O'Hale , as a calculated part of his ring technique , had not whispered constantly , " You greasy dago wop . . . W hy n't you fighting for the other side , you mother lovin ' Eytie ? . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy ? " and other pleasantries . Patroni had seen the gambit for what it was  --  an attempt to get him rattled  --  and ignored it until O'Hale landed two low blows near the groin in swift succession , which the referee , circling behind , did not observe . The combination of insults , foul blows , and excruciating pain , produced the anger which Patroni 's opponent had counted on . What he did not count on was that Joe Patroni would deliver an onslaught so swift , savage , and utterly without mercy that O'Hale went down before it and , after being counted out , was pronounced dead . Patroni was exonerated . Although the referee had not observed the low blows , others at ringside had . Even without them , Patroni had done no more than was expected  --  fought to the limit of his skill and strength . Only he was aware that for the space of seconds he had been berserk , insane . Alone and later , he faced the realization that even if he had known O'Hale was dying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he avoided the cliche of abandoning fighting , or " hanging up his gloves for good , " as the usual fiction sequence went . He had gone on fighting , employing in the ring the whole of his physical resource , not holding back , yet testing his own control to avoid crossing the hairline between reason and berserk savagery . He succeeded , and knew that he had , because there were tests of anger where reason struggled with the wild animal inside him  --  and reason won . Then , and only then , did Joe Patroni quit fighting for the remainder of his life . But control of anger did not mean dismissing it entirely . As theBpolice lieutenant returned from camera range , Patroni confronted him heatedly . " You just blocked this road an extra twenty minutes . It took ten minutes to locate those trucks where they should be ; it 'll take another ten to get them back . " As he spoke , there was the sound of a jet aircraft overhead  --  a reminder of the reason for Joe Patroni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lieutenant 's face suffused a deeper red than it already was from cold and wind . " Get through your head that I 'm in charge here . We 're glad to have help , including yours . But I 'm the one who 's making decisions . " " Then make one now ! " " I 'll make what I 'm ... " " No !  --  you listen to me . " Joe Patroni stood glaring , uninhibited by the policeman 's bulk above him . Something of the maintenanc chief 's contained anger , and a hint of authority , made the lieutenant hesitate . " There 's an emergency at the airport . I already explained it ; and why I 'm needed there . " Patroni stabbed his glowing cigar through the air for emphasis . " Maybe other people have reasons for hightailing it out of here too , but mine 's enough for now . There 's a phone in my car . I can call my top brass , who 'll call your brass , and before you know it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're polishing your TV image instead of doing the job you 're here for . So make a decision , the way you said ! Do I call in , or do we move ? " The lieutenant glared wrathfully back at Joe Patroni . Briefly , the policeman seemed ready to vent his own anger , then decided otherwise . He swung his big body toward the TV crew . " Get all that crap out of here ! You guys have had long enough . " One of the television men called over his shoulder , " We 'll just be a few minutes more , chief . " In two strides the lieutenant was beside him . " You heard me ! Right now ! " The policeman leaned down , his face still fierce from the encounter with Patroni , and the TV man visibly jumped . " Okay , okay . " He motioned hastily to the others and the lights on the portable camera went out . " Let 's have those two trucks back the way they were ! " The lieutenant began firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execute them . He returned to Joe Patroni and gestured to the overturned transport ; it was clear that he had decided Patroni was more use as an ally than an antagonist . " Mister , you still think we have to drag this rig ? You sure we ca n't get it upright ? " " Only if you want to block this road till daylight . You 'd have to unload the trailer first , and if you do ... " " I know , I know ! Forget it ! We 'll pull and shove now , and worry about damage later . " The lieutenant gestured to the waiting line of traffic . " If you want to get moving right after , you 'd better hustle your car out of line and move up front . You want an escort to the airport ? " Patroni nodded appreciatively . " Thanks . " Ten minutes later the last pindle tow hook snapped into place . Heavy chains from one tow truck were secured around the axles of the disabled transport tractor ; a stout wire cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second tow truck was connected to the toppled trailer . The third tow truck was behind the trailer , ready to push . The driver from the big transport unit , which , despite its overturning , was only partially damaged , groaned as he watched what was happening . " My bosses ai n't gon na like this ! That 's a near-new rig . You 're gon na tear it apart . " I12 . AIRPORT " If we do , " a young state trooper told him , " we 'll be finishing what you started . " " Wadda you care ? Ai n't nothing to you I just lost a good job , " the driver grumbled back . " Maybe I should try for a soft touch next time  --  like bein ' a lousy cop . " The trooper grinned . " Why not ? You 're already a lousy driver . " " You figure we 're ready ? " the lieutenant asked Patroni . Joe Patroni nodded . He was crouching , observing the tautness of chains and cables . He cautioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cab section sliding first . " The first tow truck began pulling with its winch ; its wheels skidded on snow and the driver accelerated forward , keeping the tow chain straining . The overturned transport 's front portion creaked , slid a foot or two with a protesting scream of metal , then stopped . Patroni motioned with his hand . " Keep it moving ! And get the trailer started ! " The chains and cable between the trailer axles and the second tow truck tightened . The third tow truck pushed against the trailer roof . The wheels of all three tow trucks skidded as they fought for purchase on the wet , packed snow . For another two feet the tractor and trailer , still coupled together , as they had been when they rolled over , moved sideways across the highway to an accompanying ragged cheer from the crowd of onlookers . The TV camera was functioning again , its lights adding brightness to the scene . A wide , deep gash in the road showed where the big transport had been . The tractor cab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the trailer roof beginning to angle as one side of the trailer dragged against the road . The price to be paid  --  no doubt by insurers  --  for reopening the highway quickly would be a steep one . Around the road blockage , two snowplows  --  one on either side like skirmishers  --  were attempting to clear as much as they could of the snow which had piled since the accident occurred . Everything and everyone , by this time , was snow covered , including Patroni , the lieutenant , state troopers , and all others in the open . The truck motors roared again . Smoke rose from tires , spinning on wet , packed snow . Slowly , ponderously , the overturned vehicle shifted a few inches , a few feet , then slid clear across to the far side of the road . Within seconds , instead of blocking four traffic lanes , it obstructed only one . It would be a simple matter now for the threeAIRPORT I13tow trucks to nudge the tractor-trailer clear of the highway onto the shoulder beyond . State troopers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jam which would probably occupy them for several hours to come . The sound , once again , of a jet aircraft overhead was a reminder to Joe Patroni that his principle business this night still lay elsewhere . The state police lieutenant took off his cap and shook the snow from it . He nodded to Patroni . " I guess it 's your turn , mister . " A patrol car , parked on a shoulder , was edging onto the highway . The lieutenant pointed to it . " Keep closed up behind that car . I 've told them you 'll be following , and they 've orders to get you to the airport fast . " Joe Patroni nodded . As he climbed into his Buick Wildcat , the lieutenant called after him , " And mister . . . Thanks ! " 2Captain Vernon Demerest stood back from the cupboard door he had opened , and emitted a long , low whistle . He was still in the kitchen of Gwen Meighen 's apartment on Stewardess Row . Gwen had not yet appeared after her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she suggested . It was while looking for cups and saucers that he had opened the cupboard door . In front of him were four tightly packed shelves of bottles . All were miniature bottles of liquor  --  the ounce-and-a-half size which airlines served to passengers in flight . Most of the bottles had small airline labels above their brand names , and all were unopened . Making a quick calculation , Demerest estimated there were close to three hundred . He had seen airline liquor in stewardesses ' apartments before , but never quite so much at one time . " We have some more stashed away in the bedroom , " Gwen said brightly from behind him . " We 've been saving them for a party . I think we 've enough , do n't you ? " She had come into the kitchen quietly , and he turned . As always since the beginning of their affair , he found the first sight of her enchanting and refreshing . Unusual for one who never lacked114 AIRPORTconfidence with women , he had at such moments a heady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . She was in a trim uniform skirt and blouse which made her seem even younger than she was . Her eager , high-cheekboned face was tilted upward , her rich black hair lustrous under the kitchen lights . Gwen 's deep dark eyes regarded him with smiling , frank approval . " You can kiss me hard , " she said . " I have n't put on makeup yet . " He smiled , her clear melodious English voice delighting him again . As girls from upper-crust British private schools somehow managed to do , Gwen had captured all that was best in English intonation and avoided the worst . At times , Vernon Demerest encouragedGwen to talk , merely for the joy of hearing her speak . Not talking now , they held each other tightly , her lips responding eagerly to his . After a minute or so , Gwen pushed herself away . " No ! " she insistedfirmly . " No , Vernon dear . Not here . " " Why not ? We 've time enough . " There was a thickness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  I want to talk , and we do n't have time for both . " Gwen rearranged her blouse which had parted company with the skirt . " Hell ! " he grumbled . " You bring me to the boil , and then . . . Oh , all right ; I 'll wait till Naples . " He kissed her more gently . " All the way to Europe you can think of me up there on the flight deck , turned to simmer . " " I 'll bring you to the boil again . I promise . " She laughed , and leaning close against him , passed her long slim fingers through his hair and around his face . He groaned . " My God !  --  you 're doing it right now . " " Then that 's enough . " Gwen took his hands , which were around her waist , and pushed them resolutely from her . Turning away , she moved to close the cupboard he had been looking into . " Hey , wait a minute . What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles with their airline labels . " Those ? " Gwen surveyed the four crowded shelves , her eyebrowsarched , then switched to an expression of injured innocence . " They'rejust a few little old leftovers that passengers did n't want . Surely , Captain , sir , you 're not going to report me for possession of leftovers . " He said skeptically , " That many ? " AIRPORT 115 " Of course . " Gwen picked up a bottle of Beefeater gin , put it down and inspected a Canadian Club whisky . " One nice thin  --  about airlines is , they always buy the best brands . Care for one now ? ' He shook his head . " You know better than that . " " Yes , I do ; but you should n't sound so disapproving . " " I just do n't want you to get caught . " " Nobody gets caught , and almost everybody does it . Look  --  every first class passenger is entitled to two of these little bottles , but some passengers use only one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The rules say you turn back all the unused ones . " " Oh , for heaven 's sake ! So we do  --  a couple for appearances , but the rest the girls divide between them . The same thing goes for wine that 's left over . " Gwen giggled . " We always like a passenger whc asks for more wine near the end of a trip . That way , we can officially open a fresh bottle , pour off one glass ... " " I know . And take the rest home ? " " You want to see ? " Gwen opened another cupboard door . Inside were a dozen filled wine bottles . Demerest grinned . " I 'll be damned . " " This is n't all mine . My roommate and one of the girls next door have been saving theirs for the party we 're planning . " She took his arm . " You 'll come , wo n't you ? " " If I 'm invited , I guess . " Gwen closed both cupboard doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kitchen , and she poured the tea he had made . He watched admiringly while she did it . Gwen had a way of making even a casual session like this seem an occasion . He noticed with amusement that she produced cups from a pile in another cupboard , all bearing Trans America insignia . They were the kind the airline used in flight . He supposed he should not have been stuffy about the airline liquor bottles ; after all , stewardess " perks " were nothing new . It was just that the size of the hoard amazed him . All airline stewardesses , he was aware , discovered early in their careers that a little husbandry in airplane galleys could relieve their cost of living at home . Stewardesses learned to board their flights with personal hand baggage which was partially empty , using the space for surplus food  --  always of highest quality , since airlines pur-116 AIRPORT AIRPORT I17chased nothing but the best . A Thermos jug , brought aboard empty , was useful for carrying off spare liquids  --  cream or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demerest was once assured , she could cut her weekly grocery bill in half . Only on international flights where , by law , all food  --  untouched or otherwise  --  was incinerated immediately after landing , were the girls more cautious . All this activity was strictly forbidden by regulations of all airlines  --  but it still went on . Another thing stewardesses learned was that no inventory check of removable cabin equipment was ever made at the termination of a flight . One reason was that airlines simply did n't have time ; another , it was cheaper to accept some losses than make a fuss about them . Because of this , many stewardesses managed to acquire home furnishings  --  blankets , pillows , towels , linen napkins , glasses , silverware  --  in surprising quantity , and Vernon Demerest had been in stewardess nests where most items used in daily living seemed to have come from airline sources . Gwen broke in on his thoughts . " What I was going to tell you , Vernon , is that I 'm pregnant . " It was said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He reacted blankly . " You 're what ? " " Pregnant  --  p-r-e-g-n . . . " He snapped irritably , " I know how to spell it . " His mind was still groping . " Are you sure ? " Gwen laughed  --  her attractive silvery laugh  --  and sipped her tea . He sensed she was making fun of him . He was also aware that she had never looked more lovely and desirable than at this moment . " That line you just said , darling , " she assured him , " is an old cliche . In every book I 've ever read where there 's a scene like this , the man asks , Are you sure ? " " Well , goddammit , Gwen ! " His voice rose . " Are you ? " " Of course . Or I would n't be telling you now . " She motioned to the cup in front of him . " More tea ? " " No ! " " What happened , " Gwen said calmly , " is perfectly simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you remember ?  --  we stayed at that gorgeous hotel on Nob Hill ; the one with the view . What was it called ? " " The Fairmont . Yes , I remember . Go on . " " Well , I 'm afraid I was careless . I 'd quit taking pills because they were making me overweight ; then I thought I did n't need any other precautions that day , but it turned out I was wrong . Anyway , because I was careless , now I have a teensy-weensy little Vernon Demerest inside me who 's going to get bigger and bigger . " There was a silence , then he said awkwardly , " I suppose I should n't ask this . .. " She interrupted . " Yes , you should . You 're entitled to ask . " Gwen 's deep dark eyes regarded him with open honesty . " What you want to know is , has there been anyone else , and am I positive it 's you ? Right ? " " Look , Gwen ... " She reached out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ashamed of asking . I 'd ask too , if things were the other way around . " He gestured unhappily . " Forget it . I 'm sorry . " " But I want to tell you . " She was speaking more hurriedly now , a shade less confidently . " There has n't been anybody else ; there could n't be . You see . . . I happen to love you . " For the first time her eyes were lowered . She went on , " I think I did . . . I know I did . . . love you , I mean  --  even before that time we had in San Francisco . When I 've thought about it , I 've been glad of that , be- cause you ought to love someone if you 're to have their baby , do n't you think so ? " " Listen to me , Gwen . " He covered her hands with his own . Vernon Demerest 's hands were strong and sensitive , accustomed to responsibility and control , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Women he cared about always had that effect on him , in contrast to the rough brusqueness with which he dealt with men . " We have to do some serious talking , and make some plans . " Now that the first surprise was over , his thoughts were becoming orderly . It was perfectly clear what needed to be done next . " You do n't have to do anything . " Gwen 's head came up ; her voice was under control . " And you can stop wondering if I 'm going to be difficult , or if I 'll make things awkward for you . I wo n't . I knew what I was getting into ; that there was the chance this would happen . I did n't really expect it to , but it has . I had to tell you tonight because the baby 's yours ; it 's part of you ; you ought to know . I18 AIRPORT AIRPORT I19Now you do , I 'm also telling you you do n't have to worry . I intend to work things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course I 'll help . You do n't imagine I 'd walk away and ignore the whole bit . " The essential thing , he realized , was speed ; the trick with unwanted fetuses was to get the little beggars early . He wondered if Gwen had any religious scruples about abortions . She had never mentioned having a religion , but sometimes the most unlikely people were devout . He asked her , " Are you Catholic ? " " No . " Well , he reflected , that helped . Maybe , then , a quick flight to Sweden would be the thing ; a few days there was all Gwen would need . Trans America would cooperate , as airlines always did , providingthey were not officially involved  --  the word " abortion " could be hinted at , but must never be mentioned . That way , Gwen could fly deadhead on a Trans America flight to Paris , then go by Air France to Stockholm on a reciprocal employee pass . Of course , even when she got to Sweden , the medical fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among airline people that the Swedes took their overseas abortion customers to the clinic and the cleaners at the same time . The whole thing was cheaper in Japan , of course . Lots of airline stewardesses flew to Tokyo and got abortions there for fifty dollars . The abortions were supposed to be therapeutic , but Demerest mistrusted them ; Sweden  --  or Switzerland  --  were more reliable . He had once declared : when he got a stewardess pregnant , she went first class . From his own point of view , it was a bloody nuisance that Gwen had got a bun in the oven at this particular time , just when he was building an extension on his house which , he remembered gloomily , had already gone over budget . Oh well , he would have to sell some stock  --  General Dynamics , probably ; he had a nice capital gain there , and it was about time to take a profit . He would call his broker right after getting back from Rome  --  and Naples . He asked , " You 're still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I 've been looking forward to it . Besides , I bought a new negligee . You 'll see it tomorrow night . " He stood up from the table and grinned . " You 're a shameless hussy . " A shameless pregnant hussy who shamelessly loves you . Do you love me ? " She came to him , and he kissed her mouth , face , and an ear . He probed her pinna with his tongue , felt her arms tighten in response , then whispered , " Yes , I love you . " At the moment , he reflected , it was true . " Vernon , dear . " " Yes ? " Her cheek was soft against his . Her voice came , muffled , from his shoulder . " I meant what I said . You do n't have to help me . But if you really want to , that 's different . " " I want to . " He decided he would sound her out about an abortion , on their way to the airport . Gwen disengaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's time , Captain , sir . We 'd better go . " " I guess you know you really do n't have to worry , " Vernon Demerest said to Gwen as they drove . " Airlines are used to having their unmarried stewardesses get pregnant . It happens all the time . The last report I read , the national airline average was ten percent , per year . Their discussion , he noted approvingly , was becoming increasingly matter-of-fact . Good !  --  it was important to steer Gwen away from any emotional nonsense about this baby of hers . If she did become emotional , Demerest knew , all sorts of awkward things could happen , impeding commonsense . He was handling the Mercedes carefully , with the delicate yet firm touch which was second nature to him when controlling any piece of machinery , including a car or airplane . The suburban streets , which were newly cleared when he drove from the airport to Gwen 's apartment , were thickly snow-covered again . Snow was still coming down continuously , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelter of buildings . Captain Demerest warily skirted the larger drifts . He had no intention of getting stuck nor did he even want to get out of the car until the shelter of the enclosed Trans America parking lot was reached . Curled into the leather bucket seat beside him , Gwen said incredulously , " Is that really true  --  that every year , ten out of every hundred stewardesses get pregnant ? " 12o AIRPORT I AIRPORT I2IHe assured her , " It varies slightly each year , but it 's usually pretty close . Oh , the pill has changed things a bit , but the way I hear it , not as much as you 'd expect . As a union officer I have access to that kind of information . " He waited for Gwen to comment . When she made none , he went on , " What you have to remember is that airline stewardesses are mostly young girls , from the country , or modest city homes . They 've had a quiet upbringing , an average life . Suddenly , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , stay in the best hotels . It 's their first taste of la dolce vita . " He grinned . " Once in a while that first taste leaves some sediment in the glass . " " That 's a rotten thing to say ! " For the first time since he had known her , Gwen 's temper flared . She said indignantly , " You sound so superior ; just like a man . If I have any sediment in my glass , or in me , let me remind you that it 's yours , and even if we did n't plan to leave it there , I think I 'd find a better name for it than that . Also , if you 're lumping me together with all those girls you talked about from the country and modest city homes , ' I do n't like that one damn bit either . There was heightened color in Gwen 's cheeks ; her eyes flashed angrily . " Hey ! " he said . " I like your spirit . " " Well , keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll see more of it . " " Was I that bad ? " " You were insufferable . " " Then I 'm sorry . " Demerest slowed the car and stopped at a traffic light which shone with myriad red reflections through the falling snow . They waited in silence until , with Christmas card effect , the color winked to green . When they were moving again , he said carefully , " I did n't mean to lump you with anybody , because you 're an exception . You 're a sophisticate who got careless . You said you did , yourself . I guess we were both careless . " " All right . " Gwen 's anger was dissipating . " But do n't ever put me in bunches . I 'm me ; no one else . " They were quiet for several moments , then Gwen said thoughtfully , " I suppose we could call him that . " " Call who what ? " " You made me remember what I said earlier  --  about a little VernonDemerest inside me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vernon Demerest , Junior , the way Americans do . " He had never cared much for his own name . Now he began to say , " I would n't want my son . . . " then stopped . This was dangerousground . " What I started to say , Gwen , was that airlines are used to this kind of thing . You know about the Three-Point Pregnancy Pro-gram ? " She said shortly , " Yes . " It was natural that Gwen did . Most stewardesses were aware of what airlines would do for them if they became pregnant , providing the stewardess herself agreed to certain conditions . Within Trans America the system was referred to familiarly as the " 3-PPP . " Other airlines used differing names , and arrangements varied slightly , but the principle was the same . " I 've known girls who 've used the 3-PPP , " Gwen said . " I did n't think I 'd ever need to . " " Most of the others did n't , I guess . " He added : " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that airlines advertise , and it all works quietly . How are we for time ? " Gwen held her wrist watch under the light of the dash . " We 're okay . " He swung the Mercedes into a center lane carefully , judging his traction on the wet , snowy surface , and passed a lumbering utilities truck . Several men , probably an emergency crew , were clinging to the sides of the truck as it moved along . They looked weary , wet , and miserable . Demerest wondered what the men 's reaction would be if they knew that he and Gwen would be under warm Neapolitan sunshine only hours from now . " I do n't know , " Gwen said ; " I do n't know if I could ever do it . " Like Demerest , Gwen knew the reasoning of management which lay behind airline pregnancy programs . No airline liked losing stewardesses for any reason . Their training was expensive ; a qualified stewardess represented a big investment . Another thing : the right kind of girls , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find . The way the programs worked was practical and simple . If a stewardess became pregnant , and did not plan to be married , obviouslyshe could return to her job when her pregnancy was over , and122 , AIRPORTusually her airline would be delighted to have her back . So , the arrangement was , she received official leave of absence , with her job seniority protected . As to her personal welfare , airline personnel departments had special sections which , among other things , would help make medical or nursing home arrangements , either where a girl lived or at some distant point , whichever she preferred . The airline helped psychologically , too , by letting the girl know that someone cared about her , and was looking out for her interests . A loan of money could sometimes be arranged . Afterward , if a stewardesswho had had her child was diffident about returning to her original base , she would be quietly transferred to a new one of her own choosing . In return for all this , the airline asked three assurances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , the girl must keep the airline personnel department informedof her whereabouts at all times during her pregnancy . Second , she must agree that her baby be surrendered for adoption immediately after birth . The girl would never know the baby 's adoptive parents ; thus , the child would pass out of her life entirely . However , the airline guaranteed that proper adoption procedures would be followed , with the baby being placed in a good home . Third  --  at the outset of the three-point program the stewardess must inform the airline of the name of the child 's father . When she had done so , a representative from Personnel  --  experienced in such situations  --  promptly sought out the father with the objective of obtaining financial support for the girl . What the personnel man tried to obtain was a promise , in writing , of enough money to cover medical and nursing home expenses and , if possible , some or all of the stewardess 's lost wages . Airlines preferred such arrangements to be amiable and discreet . If they had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable corporate influence to bring pressure on **25;9933;TOOLONG . It was seldom necessary to be tough where the father of a stewardess 's baby was a flying crew member  --  a captain , or first or second officer . In such cases , gentle company suasion , plus the father 's wish to keep the whole thing quiet , were usually enough . As to keeping quiet , the company obliged . Temporary support paymentscould be made in any reasonable way , or , if preferred , the airline made regular deductions from the employee 's pay checks . AIRPORT 123Just as considerately , to avoid awkward questions at home , such deductions appeared under the heading : " personal misc . " All money received by these means was paid , in its entirety , to the pregnant stewardess . The airline deducted nothing for its own costs . " The whole point about the program , " Demerest said , " is that you 're not alone , and there 's all kinds of help . " He had been careful of one thing  --  to avoid any reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate subject because no airline would , or could , become directly involved in abortion arrangements . Advice on the subject was frequently given unofficially to those who sought it  --  by stewardess supervisors who learned , through experience of others , how such arrangements could be made . Their objective , if a girl was determined on abortion , was to insure its performance under safe medical conditions , avoiding at all costs the dangerous and **25;9960;TOOLONG whom desperate people sometimes resorted to . Gwen regarded her companion curiously . " Tell me one thing . How is it you know so much about all this ? " " I told you , I 'm a union officer ... " " You 're part of the ALPA 's for pilots . You do n't have anything to do with stewardesses  --  not in that way , anyhow . " " Maybe not directly . " " Vernon , this has happened to you before . . . getting a stewardesspregnant . . . Vernon , has n't it ? " He nodded reluctantly . " Yes . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  those gullible country girls you were talking about . Or were they mostly from modest city homes ' ? " Gwen 's voice was bitter . " Flow many have there been altogether ? Two dozen , a dozen ? Just give me an idea in round figures . " He sighed . " One ; only one . " He had been incredibly lucky , of course . It could have been many more , but his answer was the truth . Well . . . almost the truth ; there was that other time , and the miscarriage , but that should n't count . Outside the car , traffic density was increasing as they neared the airport , now less than a quarter mile away . The bright lights of the great terminal , though dimmed tonight by snow , still filled the sky. 1 24 AIRPORTGwen said , " The other girl who got pregnant . I do n't want to know her name . . . " " I would n't tell you . " " Did she use the thingummy  --  the three-point program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? " He answered impatiently , " I said earlier  --  what kind of a man do you think I am ? Of course I helped her . If you must know , the company made deductions from my pay checks . That 's how I knew about the way it 's done . " Gwen smiled . " Personal misc. ? " " Yes . " " Did your wife ever know ? " He hesitated before answering . " No . " " What happened to the baby ? " " It was adopted . " " What was it ? " " Just a baby . " " You know perfectly well what I mean . Was it a boy or a girl ? " " A girl , I think . " " You think . " " I know . It was a girl . " Gwen 's questioning made him vaguely uncomfortable . It revived memories he would as soon forget . They were silent as Vernon Demerest swung the Mercedes into the airport 's wide and imposing main entry . High above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arches  --  acclaimedachievement of a world-wide design contest  --  symbolizing , so it was said , the noble dreams of aviation . Ahead was an impressive , serpentine complex of roads , interchanges , flyovers , and tunnels , designed to keep the airport 's unceasing vehicular traffic flowing at high speed , though tonight the effects of the three-day storm were making progress slower than usual . Great mounds of snow were occupying normally usable road space . Snowplows and dump trucks , trying to keep remaining areas open , were adding their own confusion . After several brief hold-ups , Demerest turned onto the service road which would bring them to the Trans America main hangar area , where they would leave the car and take a crew bus to the terminal . AIRPORT 125Gwen stirred beside him . " Vernon . " " Yes . " " Thank you for being honest with me . " She reached out , touching his nearer hand on the steering wheel . " I 'll be all right . I expect it was just a bit much , all at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He nodded and smiled , then took his hand off the wheel and clasped Gwen 's tightly . " We 'll have a great time , and I promise we 'll both remember it . " He would do his best , he decided , to ensure the promise came true . For himself , it would not be difficult . He had been more attracted to Gwen , had felt more loving in her company , and closer in spirit , than with anyone else he remembered . If it were not for his marriage . . . He wondered , not for the first time , about breaking with Sarah , and marrying Gwen . Then he pushed the thought away . He had known too many others of his profession who had suffered upheaval  --  pilots who forsook wives of many years , for younger women . More often than not , all the men had in the end were shattered hopes and heavy alimony . Sometime during their trip , though , either in Rome or Naples , he must have another serious discussion with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone exactly as he would have liked , nor had the question of an abortion yet been raised . Meanwhile  --  the thought of Rome reminded him  --  there was the more immediate matter of his command of Trans America Flight Two. 3The key was to room 224 of the O'Hagan Inn . In the semidarkened locker area adjoining the air traffic control radar room , Keith Bakersfeld realized he had been staring at the key and its identifying plastic tag for several minutes . Or had it been seconds only ? It might have been . Just lately , like so much else , the passage of time seemed inconstant and disoriented . Sometimes at home recently , Natalie had found him standing quite still , looking into nothingness . And when she had asked , with concern , Why are you there ? , only then had he become awakened to where he was , and had resumed movement and conscious thinking. i26 AIRPORTWhat had happened , he supposed  --  then and a moment ago  --  was that his worn , weary mind had switched itself off . Somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinew , stored thought , and emotion  --  was a tiny switch , a self-defense mechanism like a thermal cutout in an electric motor , which worked when the motor was running too hot and needed to be saved from burning itself out . The difference , though , between a motor and a human brain , was that a motor stayed out of action if it needed to . A brain would not . The floodlights outside , on the face of the control tower , still reflected enough light inward through the locker room 's single windowfor Keith to see . Not that he needed to see . Seated on one of the wooden benches , the sandwiches Natalie had made , untouched , beside him , he was doing nothing more than holding the O'Hagan Inn key and thinking , reflecting on the paradox of the human brain . A human brain could achieve soaring imagery , conceive poetry and radarscopes , create the Sistine Chapel and a supersonic Concorde . Yet a brain , too  --  holding memory and conscience  --  could be compelling , self-tormenting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persecution . Death . . . with oblivion , forgetfulness ; with rest at last . It was the reason that Keith Bakersfeld had decided on suicide tonight . He must go back soon to the radar room . There were still several hours of his shift remaining , and he had made a pact with himself to finish his air traffic control duty for tonight . He was not sure why , except that it seemed the right thing to do , and he had always tried to do the right thing , conscientiously . Perhaps being conscientiouswas a family trait ; he and his brother Mel always seemed to have that much in common . Anyway , when the duty was done  --  his final obligation finished  --  he would be free to go to the O'Hagan Inn , where he had registered late this afternoon . Once there , without wasting time , he would take the forty Nembutal capsules  --  sixty grains in all  --  which were in a drugstore pillbox in his pocket . He had husbanded the capsules , a few at a time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him sleep , and from each prescription which Natalie 's druggist had delivered , he had carefully extracted half and hidden it . A few days ago he had gone to a library , checking a reference book on clinicalAIRPORT 127toxicology to assure himself that the quantity of Nembutal he had was well in excess of a fatal dose . His present duty shift would end at midnight . Soon after , when he had taken the capsules , sleep would come quickly and with finality . He looked at his watch , holding its face toward the light from outside . It was almost nine o'clock . Should he return to the radar room now ? No  --  stay a few minutes longer . When he went , he wanted to be calm , his nerves steady for whatever these last few hours of duty might contain . Keith Bakersfeld fingered the O'Hagan Inn key again . Room 224 . It was strange about the coincidence of figures ; that his room number tonight ; allocated by chance , should have in it a " 24 . " There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the occult significance of numbers . Keith did n't , though if he did , those third and last figures , prefaced by a " 2 , " could be taken to mean 24 for the second time . The first 24 had been a date , a year and a half ago . Keith 's eyes misted , as they had so many times before , when he remembered . The date was seared  --  with self-reproach and anguish  --  in his memory . It was the wellspring of his darksome spirit , his utter desolation . It was the reason he would end his life tonight . A summer 's day ; morning . Thursday , June the twenty-fourth . It was a day for poets , lovers , and color photographers ; the kind of day which people stored up in their minds , to open like a scrapbook when they wanted to remember , years later , all that was best of any time and place . In Leesburg , Virginia , not far from historic Harpers Ferry , the sky was clear at dawn  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorthand for " ceiling and visibility unlimited " ; and conditions stayed that way , except for a few cotton-wool tufts of scattered cumulus by afternoon . The sun was warm , but not oppressive . A gentle breeze from the Blue Ridge Mountains carried the scent of honeysuckle . On his way to work that morning  --  driving to the Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center at Leesburg  --  Keith Bakersfeld had seen wild roses blooming . He thought of a line from Keats which he had learned in high school  --  " For Summer has o'erbrimmed ... " It seemed appropriate to such a day. 128 AIRPORTHe had driven , as usual , across the Virginia border  --  from Adamstown , Maryland , where he and Natalie , with their two boys , shared a pleasant rented home . The top of the Volkswagen convertible was down ; he had traveled without haste , enjoying the benevolence of air and sun , and when the familiar low , modern buildings of the Air Route Center came in sight , he had felt less tense than usual . Afterward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cause of the events which followed . Even inside the Operations Wing  --  thick-walled and windowless , where daylight never penetrated  --  Keith had an impression that the glory of the summer 's day outside had somehow percolated inward . Among the seventy or more shirtsleeved controllers on duty there seemed a sense of lightness , in contrast to the pressure-driven earnestness with which work proceeded on most days of the year . One reason , perhaps , was that the traffic load was less than usual , due to the exceptionally clear weather . Many non-commercial flights  --  private , military , even a few airliners  --  were operating on VFR  --  " visual flight rules , " or the see-and-be-seen method by which aircraft pilots kept track of their own progress through the air , without need to report by radio to ATC air route controllers . The Washington Air Route Center at Leesburg was a key control point . From its main operations room all air traffic on airways over six eastern seaboard states was observed and directed . Added up , the control area came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , whenever an aircraft which had filed an instrument flight plan left an airport , it came under Leesburg observation and control . It remained under that control either until its journey was complete or it passed out of the area . Aircraft coming into the area were handed over from other control centers , of which there were twenty across the continental United States . The Leesburg center was among the nation 's busiest . It included the southern end of the " northeast corridor " which daily accommodated the world 's heaviest concentration of air traffic . Oddly , Leesburg was distant from any airport , and forty miles from Washington , D.C. , from which the Air Route Center took its name . The center itself was in Virginia countryside  --  a cluster of low , modern buildings with a parking lot  --  and was surrounded on three sides by rolling farmland . Nearby was a small stream named Bull Run  --  its fame enshrined forever by two battles of the Civil War . AIRPORT 129Keith Bakersfeld had once gone to Bull Run after duty , reflecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and present . This morning , despite awareness of the summer 's day outside , everything in the spacious , cathedral-like main control room was operating as usual . The entire control area  --  larger than a football field  --  was , as always , dimly lighted to allow proper viewing of the several dozen radar screens , arranged in tiers and rows under overhangingcanopies . The control room noise level was what any newcomernoticed first . From a flight data area , with great banks of computers , assorted electronic gear and automatic teletypes , arose the continuous whir and chatter of machinery . Nearby , from dozens of positions where controllers sat , directing aerial traffic , came a ceaseless hum of voice radio exchanges on a host of frequencies . The machineryand human voices merged , producing a constant noise level which was all-pervading , yet strangely muted by acoustic , soundabsorbentwalls and ceilings . Above the working level of the control room was an observation bridge , running the room 's full width , where occasional visitors were brought to watch proceedings below . The control room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a stock exchange . Controllersrarely glanced up at the bridge , being trained to ignore anythingwhich might diminish concentration on their work , and since only a few especially privileged visitors ever made it to the control room floor , controllers and outsiders rarely met . Thus the work was not only high pressure , but also monastic  --  the last condition added to by the total absence of women . In an annex to the control room Keith slipped off his jacket , and came in wearing the crisp white shirt which was like a uniform for air traffic controllers . No one knew why controllers wore white shirts on duty ; there was no rule about it , but most of them did . As he passed other control positions while heading for his own , a few colleagues wished him a friendly " good morning , " and that was unusual too . Normally , the immediate sense of pressure on entering the control area made it customary to give a hurried nod or a brief " Hi ! "  --  sometimes not even that . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pittsburgh-Baltimore area . The sector was monitored by a team of three . Keith was radar controller , his job to maintain130 AIRPORTcontact with aircraft and to issue radio instructions . Two assistant controllers handled flight data and airport communications ; a supervisorcoordinated activities of the other three . Today , in addition , the team had a trainee controller whom Keith had been instructing , at intervals , over the past several weeks . Others of the team were drifting in at the same time as Keith Bakersfeld , taking position behind the men they were to relieve , and allowing a few minutes while they absorbed the " picture " in their minds . All through the big control room , at other positions , the same thing was happening . Standing at his own sector , behind the radar controller about to go off duty , Keith already felt his mental acuity sharpen , his speed of thinking consciously accelerate . For the next eight hours , except for two brief work breaks , his brain must continue to operate that way . Traffic , he observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking into account the widespread good weather . On the scope 's dark surface , some fifteen pinpoints of bright green light  --  or " targets , " as radarmen called them  --  indicated aircraft in the air . Allegheny had a Convair 440 at eight thousand feet , approaching Pittsburgh . Behindthe Allegheny flight , at varying altitudes , were a National DC-8 , an American Airlines 727 , two private aircraft  --  a Lear jet and a Fairchild F-27  --  and another National , this time a prop-jet Electra . Several other flights , Keith noted , were due to come on the screen at any moment , both from other sectors and as a result of takeoffs from Friendship Airport , Baltimore . Going the opposite way , toward Baltimore , was a Delta DC-9 , about to be taken over by Friendship approach control ; behind this flight were a TWA , a Piedmont AirlinesMartin , another private flight , two Uniteds , and a Mohawk . Height and distance separations of all aircraft were satisfactory , Keith observed , except that the two Uniteds heading for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still at the scope had read Keith 's mind , he gave the second United a delaying diversionary course . " I have the picture , " Keith said quietly . The other controller nodded and moved out . Keith 's supervisor , Perry Yount , plugged in his headset above Keith 's head and leaned over , making his own assessment of the traffic situation . Perry was a tall , lean Negro , a few years younger than Keith . He had a quick , retentive memory which could store a mass of flight data , then repeat it back , as a whole or in pieces , withAIRPORT 131computer accuracy . Perry was a comforting man to have around when there was trouble . Keith had already accepted several new flights and handed over others when the supervisor touched his shoulder . " Keith , I 'm running two positions this shift  --  this and the next one . We 're a man short . You okay for a while ? " Keith nodded . " Roger . " He radioed a course correction to an Eastern 727 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had slipped into a seat beside him . " I 've got George to keep an eye on me . " " Okay . " Perry Yount unplugged his headset and moved to the adjacent console . The same kind of thing had happened occasionally before , and was handled without difficulty . Perry Yount and Keith had worked together for several years ; each was aware that he could trust the other . Keith told the trainee beside him , " George , start getting the picture . " George Wallace nodded and edged closer to the radarscope . He was in his mid-twenties , had been a trainee for almost two years ; before that , he had served an enlistment in the U. S. Air Force . Wallace had already shown himself to have an alert , quick mind , plus the ability not to become rattled under tension . In one more week he would be a qualified controller , though for practical purposeshe was fully trained now . Deliberately , Keith allowed the spacing between an American Airlines BAG400 and a National 727 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to transmit quick instructions if the closure became critical . George Wallace spotted the condition at once , and warned Keith , who corrected it . That kind of firsthand exercise was the only sure way the ability of a new controller could be gauged . Similarly , when a trainee was at the scope himself , and got into difficulties , he had to be given the chance to show resourcefulness and sort the situation out unaided . At such moments , the instructing controller was obliged to sit back , with clenched hands , and sweat . Someone had once described it as , " hanging on a brick wall by your fingernails . " When to intervene or take over was a critical decision , not to be made too early or too late . If the instructor did take over , the trainee 's confidence might be permanently undermined , and a potentially good controller lost . On132 AIRPORTthe other hand , if an instructor failed to take over when he should , a ghastly mid-air collision could result . The risks involved , and extra mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . They pointed out that the task of teaching their work to others carried neither official recognitionnor extra pay . Moreover , if anything went wrong , the instructingcontroller was wholly responsible . Why suffer so much strain and liability for nothing ? Keith , however , had shown an aptitude as an instructor as well as patience in bringing trainees along . And although he , too , suffered and sweated at times , he did the job because he felt he should . At this moment , he took a personal pride in the way George Wallace had developed . Wallace said quietly again , " I 'd turn United 284 right until you get altitude separation with Mohawk . " Keith nodded agreement as he thumbed his microphone button . " United Flight 284 , from Washington center . Turn right , heading zero six zero . " Promptly the reply crackled back . " Washington control , this is United 284 . Roger ; zero six zero . " Miles distant , and high above in clear bright sunshine while passengers dozed or read , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn . On the radarscope , the bright green half inch wide blip which was United 284 began moving in a new direction . Below the control area , in a room devoted to rack upon rack of ponderously turning tape recorders , the exchange between ground and air had been recorded  --  for playback later if need arose . Every such conversation , from each position in the control room , was recorded and stored . Periodically , some of the tapes were replayed and listened to critically by supervisors . If a procedure was wrong , a controller heard about it ; yet no controller knew when a recording of his own might be selected for analysis . On a door of the taperecorderroom was the grimly humorous reminder , " Big Brother Is Listening . " The morning progressed . Periodically , Perry Yount appeared . He was still overseeing two positions and stayed long enough to assess the current traffic situation . What he saw seemed to satisfy him , and he spent less time behind Keith than at the other position , where several problems seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eased slightly ; it would pick up again before midday . Soon after 10:30 A.M. Keith Bakersfeld and George Wallace exchanged positions . The trainee was now at the scope , Keith checking from alongside . There was no need , Keith found , for intervention ; young Wallace was proving competent and alert . As far as was possible in the circumstances , Keith relaxed . At ten to eleven , Keith was aware of a need to visit the toilet . In recent months , he had had several bouts with intestinal flu ; he had a suspicion that this was the beginning of another . He signaled Perry Yount and told him . The supervisor nodded . " Is George doing okay ? " " Like a veteran . " Keith said it loud enough so George could hear . " I 'll hold things down , " Perry said . " You 're relieved , Keith . " " Thanks . " Keith signed the sector log sheet and noted his time of checking out Perry scribbled an initial on the next line of the log , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , when Keith returned , they would follow the same procedure . As Keith Bakersfeld left the control room , the supervisor was studying the scope , his hand lightly on George Wallace 's shoulder . The washroom Keith had gone to was on an upper level ; a frostedglasswindow admitted some of the brightness of the day outside . When Keith had finished , and freshened himself with a wash , he went to the window and opened it . He wondered if the weather was still as superb as when he had arrived earlier . It was . From the rear of the building into which the window was set , he could see  --  beyond a service area  --  green meadows , trees , and wild flowers . The heat was greater now . All around was a drowsy hum of insects . Keith stood looking out , aware of a reluctance to leave the cheerful sunlight and return to the control room 's gloom . It occurred to him that lately he had had similar feelings at other times  --  too many times , perhaps ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the gloom he minded so much , but the mental pressures . There was a time when the tensions and pressures of his job , unrelenting as they were , had never bothered him . Nowadays they did , and on occasions he had to force himself , consciously , to meet them . I34 AIRPORT While Keith Bakers f eld was standing at the window , thinking , a Northwest Orient 727 jet , en route from Minneapolis-St . Paul , was nearing Washington , D.C. Within its cabin a stewardess was bending over an elderly male passenger . His face was ashen ; he seemed unable to speak . The stewardess believed he had had , or was having , a heart attack . She hurried to the flight deck to inform the captain . Moments later , acting on the captain 's orders , the Northwest first officer asked Washington Air Route Center for special clearance down , with priority handling to Washington Na- tional Airport . Keith wondered sometimes  --  as he was wondering now  --  how many more years he could force his occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controller for a decade and a half . He was thirty-eight . The depressing thing was  --  in this business you could be mentally drained , an old man , at age forty-five or fifty , yet honorable retire- ment was another ten or fifteen years away . For many air traffic controllers , those final years proved an all-too-grueling trail , whose end they failed to reach . Keith knew  --  as most controllers did  --  that strains on the human systems of those employed in air traffic control had long been rec- ognized . Official flight surgeons ' files bulged with medical evidence . Case histories , directly attributable to controllers ' work , included hy- pertension , heart attacks , gastric ulcers , tachycardia , psychiatric break- downs , plus a host of lesser ailments . Eminent , independent medics , in scholarly research studies , had confirmed such findings . In the words of one : " A controller will spend nervous , sleepless hours every night wondering how in the name of heaven he kept all those planes from running into each other . He managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the same luck tomorrow ? After a while , something inside him  --  physical , mental , oftentimes both  --  inevitably breaks down . " Armed with this knowledge , and more , the Federal Aviation Agency had urged Congress to allow air traffic controllers to retire at age fifty , or after twenty years of service . The twenty years , doctors declared , were equal to forty in most other jobs . The FAA warned legislators : public safety was involved ; controllers , after more than twenty years of service , were potentially unsafe . Congress , Keith remembered , had ignored the warning and refused to act . Subsequently , a Presidential Commission also turned thumbs down on early retirement for controllers , and the FAA  --  then a presidential agency  --  had been told to cease and desist in its argument . Now , officially , it had . Privately , however  --  as Keith and others knew  --  Washington FAA officials were as convinced as ever ; they predicted that the question would arise again , though only after an air disaster , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and public furor . Keith 's thoughts switched back to the countryside . It was glorious today ; the fields inviting , even when viewed from a washroom window . He wished he could go out there and sleep in the sun . Well , he could n't , and that was that . He supposed he had better get back to the control room . He would  --  in just a moment more . The Northwest Orient 727 had already started down , on authorityfrom Washington Center . At lower altitudes , other flights were being hurriedly diverted , or ordered to orbit , safe distances away . A slanting hole , through which Northwest would continue descending , was being cleared in the growing midday traffic . Approach control at Washington National Airport had been alerted ; its function would come shortly when it accepted the Northwest jet from Washington Center . At this moment , responsibility for the Northwest flight and other aircraft devolved on the sector team next to Keith 's  --  the extra sector which the young Negro , Perry Yount , was supervising . Fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per hour were being juggled in an airspace a few miles wide . No airplane must come near another . The Northwest flight must be brought down , safely , through them all . Similar situations happened several times a day ; in bad weather it could be several times an hour . Sometimes emergencies came together , so that controllers numbered them  --  emergency one , emergencytwo , emergency three . In the present situation , as always , Perry Yount  --  quiet-spoken , cool , and capable  --  was responding with experienced skill . Working with others in the sector team , he was co-ordinating emergency procedures  --  calmly , level voiced , so that from his tone no bystander listening would be aware that an emergency existed . Other aircra f t could not hear transmissions to the Northwest flight , which had been instructed to switch to a separate radio frequency . Everything was going well . The Northwest flight was steady on course , descending . In a few minutes , the emergency situation would be over . Amid the pressures , Perry Yount even found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally would have his undivided attention  --  to check George Wallace . Everything looked good , though Perry knew he would be easier in mind when Keith Bakers f eld was back . He glanced toward the control room door . No sign of Keith yet . Keith  --  still at the open window , still looking out at the Virginia countryside  --  was remembering Natalie . He sighed . Lately , there had been disagreements between them , triggered by his work . There were points of view which his wife could or would not see . Natalie was concerned about Keith 's health . She wanted him to give up air traffic control ; to quit , and choose some other occupation while some of his youth and most of his health remained . It had been a mistake , he realized now , to confide his doubts to Natalie , to describe what he had seen happen to other controllers whose work had made them prematurely old and ailing . Natalie had become alarmed , perhaps with reason . But there were considerations to giving up a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it was hard for Natalie  --  or for any woman , he supposed  --  to grasp . Over Martinsburg , West Virginia  --  some thirty miles northwest of Washington Route Center  --  a private , four-place Beech Bonanza , at seven thousand feet , was leaving Airway V 166 and entering AirwayV44 . The little Beech Bonanza , identifiable visually by its butterfly tail , was cruising at 175 mph , its destination Baltimore . It contained the Redfern family : Irving Re f ern , a consulting engineereconomist , his wife Merry , and their two children  --  Jeremy , ten years old , and Valerie , nine . Irving Redfern was a careful , thorough man . Today , because of favorable weather conditions , he could have flown using visual flight rules . However , he considered it more prudent to file an instrument flight plan and , since leaving his home airport of Charleston , West Virginia , had stayed on airways , remaining in touch with air traffic control . A few moments earlier , Washington Route Center had given him a new course on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his magnetic compass , which had been swinging slightly , was settling down nicely . The Red f erns were going to Baltimore partly for Irving Red f ern 's business , and partly for pleasure , which would include a family theatre outing tonight . While their father was concentrating on his flying , the children , with Merry , were chattering about what they would have for lunch at Friendship Airport . The Washington Center controller who had given Irving Redfern his latest instructions was George Wallace , the almost-qualified trainee still filling in for Keith Bakers f eld . George had correctly identified the Red f erns ' Beechcra f t on his radarscope , where it appeared as a bright green dot , though smaller and moving more slowly than most other traffic  --  at the moment , principally airline jets . There was nothing closing up on the Beechcra f t , however , which appeared to have plenty of airspace all around it . Perry Yount , the sector supervisor , had by now returned to the adjoining position . He was helping sort out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been handed over safely to Washington National Airport approach control . Periodically , Perry glanced across at George and once called out , " Is everything okay ? " George Wallace nodded , though he was beginning to sweat a little . Today 's heavier noontime traffic seemed to be building up earlier than usual . Unknown to George Wallace or Perry Yount or Irving Redfern , an Air National Guard T-33 jet trainer was flying  --  at the moment idly in circles  --  a few miles north of Airway V44 . The T-33 was from Martin Airport , near Baltimore , and its National Guard pilot was an automobile salesman named Hank Neel . Lieutenant Neel , who was fulfilling his part-time military training requirements , had been sent up solo for VFR proficiency flying . Because he had been cautioned to do only local flying in an authorized area northwest of Baltimore , no flight plan had been filed ; therefore , Washington Air Route Center had no knowledge that the T-33 was in the air . This would not have mattered , except that Ned had become bored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looking out casually , as he held the jet trainer in lazy circles , he realized he had drifted south while practicing maneuvers , though in reality he had come a good deal farther than he imagined . He was so far south that several minutes ago the National Guardjet had entered George Wallace 's radar control area and now appeared on Wallace 's screen at Leesburg as a green dot , slightly larger then the Redfern family 's Beech Bonanza . A more experienced controllerwould have recognized the dot instantly for what it was . George , however , still busy with other traffic , had not yet observed the extra , unidentified signal . Lieutenant Neel , at fifteen thousand feet , decided he would finish his flying practice with some aerobatics  --  two loops , a couple of slow rolls  --  and then return to base . He swung the T-33 into a steep turn and circled again while he took the standard precaution of looking for other airplanes above and below . He was now even closer than before to Airway V44 . The thing his wife failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man could n't just quit his job irresponsibly , on a whim , even if he wanted to . Especially when the man had a family to support , children to educate . Especially when the job you possessed , the skills you so patiently acquired , had fitted you for nothing else . In some branches of government service , employees could leave and utilize their proficiency elsewhere . Air traffic controllers could not . Their work had no counterpart in private industry ; no one else wanted them . Being trapped that way  --  which was what it amounted to , Keith recognized  --  was a disillusion which came with other disillusions . Money was one . When you were young , enthusiastic , wanting to be a part of aviation , the civil service pay scale of an air traffic controllerseemed adequate or better . Only later did it become clear how inadequate  --  in relation to the job 's awesome responsibility  --  that pay scale was . The two most skillful specialists involved in air traffic nowadays were pilots and controllers . Yet pilots earned thirty thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten thousand . No one believed pilots should earn less . But even pilots , who were notoriously selfish in taking care of themselves , believed air traffic controllers should earn more . Nor was promotion  --  as in most other occupations  --  something an air traffic controller could look forward to . Senior supervisory posts were few ; only a fortunate handful ever attained them . And yet ... unless you were reckless or uncaring  --  which controllers , by the nature of their work , were not  --  there was no way out . So there would be no quitting for himself , Keither decided . He must have another talk with Natalie ; it was time she accepted that for better or worse , it was too late for change . He had no intention , at this stage , of scratching inadequately for some other kind of living . He really must go back . Glancing at his watch , he realized guiltily that it was almost fifteen minutes since he left the control room . For part of the time he had been daydreaming  --  something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of the summer 's day . Keith closed the washroom window . From the corridoroutside , he hurried downward to the main control room . High over Frederick County , Maryland , Lieutenant Neel straightenedup his National Guard T-33 and eased on forward trim . Neel had completed his somewhat casual inspection and had seen no other aircraft . Now , beginning his first loop and slow roll , he put the jet trainer into a steep dive . Entering the control room , Keith Bakersfeld was aware at once of an increased tempo . The hum of voices was louder than when he left . Other controllers were too preoccupied to glance up  --  as they had done earlier this morning  --  as he passed by them on the way to his own position . Keith scribbled a signature in the sector log and noted the time , then moved behind George Wallace , getting the picture , letting his eyes adjust to the control room semidarkness , in sharp contrast to the bright sunlight outside . George had murmured " Hi ! " as Keith returned , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , when Keith had the picture , he would relieve George and slip into his seat . It had probably been good for George , Keith reasoned , to be on his own for a while ; it would improve his confidence . From the adjoining sector console , Perry Yount had noted Keith 's return . Keith studied the radarscope and its moving pinpoints of lighttheaircraft " targets " which George had identified , then noted on small movable markers on the screen . A bright green dot without identification caught Keith 's eye . He asked George sharply , " What 's the other traffic near the Beech Bonanza 403 ? " Lieutenant Neel had finished his first loop and slow roll . He had climbed back to fifteen thousand feet , and was still over **25;9987;TOOLONG COUPLES Welcome to Tarbox  --  41been a clangor about him even then , a snuffly explosive air of self-parody , with his wiglike mop of hair , combed straight forward , and a nose so hooked its tip appeared to point at his lower lip .

Before he took her up she had felt pale , tall , stiff , cold , unusable . His back was hairy and humpily muscular across the shoulder blades and thickly sown , as if by a curse , with moles . With a tact more crushing than brute forbidding her parents gradually made her love grotesque and untenable . She did not know how they did it : it was as if her parents and Peter communicatedthrough her , without her knowing what was being said , until the No came from both sides , and met beneath her ribs .

She remembered the bleached light that had filled her room each . morning before she awoke to the soreness in her chest . Ken appeared , was taller than she , wanted her , was acceptableandwas accepted on all sides ; similarly , nagging mathematical problems abruptly crack open . Foxy could find no fault with him , and this challenged her , touched off her stubborn defiant streak . She felt between his handsomeness and intelligence a contradictionthat might develop into the convoluted humor of her Jew . Ken looked like a rich boy and worked like a poor one . From Farmington , he was the and painless , without a tear or outcry . Nothing puzzled him . There were unknowns but no mysteries . After her own degradingmiscalculation  --  for this was what her first romance musthave been , it ended in such a flurry of misery  --  Foxy sought shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple superiority to other people . He was better-looking , better-thinking , a better machine . He was fallible only if he took her , on the basis of the cool poise her tallness had demanded , for another of the same breed . She was , Elizabeth Fox from Bethesda , known to herself in terms of suppressed warmth . Applaudingly her adolescent heart had watched itself tug toward stray animals , lost children , forsakenheroines , and toward the bandaged wounded perambulating around the newly built hospital , with its ugly tall rows of windowslike zipped zippers . They had moved from east Washington in the spring of 1941 , as the hospital was being built . Her father was a career navy man , a lieutenant commander with some knowledge of engineering and an exaggerated sense of lineage . One of his grandfathers had been a Virginia soldier ; the other , a New Jersey parson . He felt himself to be a gentleman and told Foxy , when she came to him at the age of twelve inspired to be a nurse , that she was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Radcliffe , looking back , she supposed that her sense of deflected tenderness dated from her father 's long absences during World War II ; the accident of global war had deprived her of the filial transition to heterosexual relationships free of slavishness , of the expiatory humiliations she goaded Peter to inflict . Now , herselfmarried , milder and less mathematical in her self-analyses , she wondered if the sadness , the something broken and uncompleted in her upbringing , was not older than the war and belonged to the Depression , whose shadowy air of magnificent impotence , of trolley cars and sinusitis , still haunted the official mausoleums of Washington when she visited her mother . Perhaps the trouble had merely been that her mother , though shrewd and once pretty , had not been a gentlewoman , but a Maryland grocer 's daughter . Foxy had no sooner married than her parents had gotten divorced . Her father , his thirty years of service expired , far from retiring , took a lucrative advisory job to the shipbuilding industry , and moved to San Diego . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could navigate in the waters of prosperity , remarWelcometo Tarbox42 COUPLESricd : a wealthy Georgetown widower , a Mr. Roth , who owned a chain of coin-operated laundromats , mostly in Negro neighborhoods . Foxy 's mother now made herself up carefully , put on a girdle even to go shopping , kept a poodle , smoked red-tipped filtered cigarettes , was known to their friends as " Connie , " and always spoke of her husband as " Roth . " The couple Foxy 's parents had been had vanished . The narrow shuttered frame house on Rosedale Street . The unused front porch . The tan shades always drawn against the heat . The electricfan in the kitchen swinging its slow head back and forth like an imbecile scolding in monotone . The staticky Philco conveyingLowell Thomas . The V-mail spurting through the thrilled slot . The once-a-week Negro woman , called Gracelyn , whose apron pockets smelled of orange peels and Tootsie Rolls . Veronicatheir jittery spayed terrier who was succeeded by Merle , a slavering black-tongued Chow . The parched flowerless shrubberywhere Elizabeth would grub for bottlecaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the red-checked oilcloth on the kitchen table worn bare at two settings , the way her mother would sit nights at this table , after the news , before putting her daughter to bed , smoking a Chesterfield and smoothingwith a jerky automatic motion the skin beneath her staring eyes : these images had vanished everywhere but in Foxy 's heart . She went to church to salvage something . Episcopalianism  --  its rolling baritone hymns to the sea , its pews sparkling with the officers ' shoulder-braid  --  had belonged to the gallant club of Daddy 's friends , headed by caped Mr. Roosevelt , that fought and won the war . She was graduated and married in June of 1956 . Every marriage is a hedged bet . Foxy entered hers expecting that , whatever fate held for them , there were certain kinds of abuse it would never occur to her husband to inflict . He was beyond them , as most American men are beyond eye-gouging and evisceration . She had been right . He had proved not so much gentle as too fastidious to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unjust one that the delay while she waited barren for Ken to complete his doctorate had been long . Four intended43years of post-graduate work had been stretched into five by the agonies of his dissertation ; two more were spent in a postdoctoralfellowship granted by the U.S. Public Health Service ; and then Ken squandered another as an instructor in the vicinity of the same magnetic Harvard gods , whose very names Foxy had come to hate . For her , there had been jobs , little research assistantshipsamid Flemish prints or Mesozoic fern fossils in comfortabledusty Harvard basements , a receptionist 's desk at UniversityHall , an involvement in a tutoring project for mentally disturbed children that had led her to consider and then to run from a career in social work , some random graduate courses , a stab at a master 's degree , two terms of life-drawing in Boston , vacations , even flirtations : but nothing fruitful .

This seemed the best gift she could offer him , since she grew to know that there was something of herself she withheld . A child , a binding of their chemistries , would be an honest pledge of her admiration and trust and would remove them for good from the plane where the sufficiency of these feelings could be doubted . Now this gift was permitted . Ken was an assistant professor at the university across the river , where the department of biochemistry was more permeable to rapid advancement . Their reasons for happinesswere as sweeping as the view from their new house . The house had been Ken 's choice . She had thought they should live closer to Boston , in Lexington perhaps , among people like themselves . Tarbox was an outer limit , an hour 's drive , and yet he , who must do the commuting , seized the house as if all his life he had been waiting for a prospect as vacant and pure as these marshes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps , Foxy guessed , it was a matter of scale : his microscopic work needed the relief of such a vastness . And it had helped that he and the real-estate man Gallagher had liked each other . Though she had raised all the reasonable objections , Foxy had been pleased to see him , after the long tame stasis of student existence , emerge to44 COUPLESwant something new , physical , real . That he had within him even the mild strangeness needed to insist on an out-of-the-way impracticalhouse seemed ( as if there had been a question of despair ) hopeful . The house tonight was cold , stored with stale chill . Cotton , their cat , padded loudly toward them from the dark living room and , stiff from sleep , stretched . He was a heavy-footed caramel tom that in years of being their only pet had acquired something of a dog 's companionableness and something of a baby 's conceit . Courteously he bowed before them , his tail an interrogation mark , his front claws planted in the braided rag rug the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free with a dainty unsticking noise and purred in anticipation of Foxy 's picking him up . She held him , his throaty motor running , beneath her chin and like a child wished herself magically inside his pelt . Ken switched on a light in the living room . The bare walls leaped into being , the exposed studs , the intervals of varnish , the crumbling gypsum wallboard , the framed souvenirs of old summers  --  fan-shapedshell collections and dried arrays of littoral botany  --  that the Robinsons had left . ' l'hey had never met them but Foxy saw them as a large sloppy family , full of pranks and nicknames for each other and hobbies , the mother watercoloring ( her work was tacked all around upstairs ) , the older boys sailing in the marsh , the girl moonily collecting records and being teased , the younger boy and the father systematically combing the shore for classifiable examples of life . The room smelled as if summer had been sealed in and yet had leaked out . The French windows giving onto a side garden of roses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows that would have looked onto the porch and the marsh . The sharp-edged Cambridge furniture , half Door Store and half Design Research , looked scattered and sparse ; the room was a good size and of a good square shape . It had possibilities . It needed white paint and walls and light and love and style . She said , " We must start doing things . " Ken felt the floor register with his hand . " The furnace is dead again . " " Leave it to morning . No warmth gets upstairs anyway . " Welcome to Tarbox : 45 " I do n't like being outsmarted . I 'm going to learn how to bank this bastard . " " I 'm more worried about dying in my sleep of coal gas . " " No chance of that in this sieve . " " Ken , please call Hanema . " " You call him . " " You 're the man of the house .

Fine . " He went to the door that led down into the narrow hole that did for a basement . The register began to clank and release a poisonous smell . Foxy carried Cotton into the kitchen , plugged in the electric heater , and poured two bowls of milk . One she set on the floor for the cat ; the other she broke Saltines into , for herself . Cotton sniffed , disdained the offering , and interrogatively mewed . Foxy ignored him and ate greedily with a soup spoon . Crackers and milk had been a childhood treat between news and bedtime ; her craving for it had come over her like a sudden release from fever , a gust of health . While the glow of the heater and the begging friction of fur alternated on her legs , she spread butter thickly on spongy white bread , tearing it , overweighting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bother with toast , compulsive as a drunk . Her fingertips gleamed with butter . Washing them , she leaned on her slate sink and gazed from the window . The tide was high ; moonlight displayed a silver saturationoverflowing the linear grid of ditches . Against the sheen was silhouetted a little houseless island of brambles . In the distance , along the far arm of Tarbox Bay , the lights of another town , whose name she had not yet learned , spangled the horizon . A revolving searchlight rhythmically stroked the plane of ocean . Its beam struck her face at uneven intervals . She counted : five , two , five , two . A double beam . Seconds slipping , gone ; five , two . She hastily turned and rolled up the cellophane breadwrapper ; a volu-46 . COUPLESminous sadness had been carved for her out of the night .

That old-fashioned rubbery kind with all the chemicals . " " Calcium propionate , " he said . " Our child will be an agglutinatedmonster . " " Did you mean it , I should call this Dutchman ? " " Why not ? See what he says . He must know the house , if his wife wanted it . " But she heard doubt in his even voice and changed the subject . " You know what bothered me about those people tonight ? " " They were Republicans . " " Do n't be silly , I could n't care less . No what bothered me was they wanted us to love them . They were n't lovable , but that 's what they wanted . " IIc laughed . Why should his laugh grate so ? " Maybe that 's what you wanted , " he told her . They went to bed up a staircase scarred and crayoned by children they had never seen . Foxy assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would enjoy a great animal draught of sleep . Ken kissed her shoulder in token of the love they should not in this month make , turned his back , and quickly went still . His breathing was inaudible and he never moved . The stillness of his body established a tension she could not quite sink through , like a needle on the skin of water . Downstairs , Cotton 's heavy feet padding back and forth unsatisfied seemed to make the whole house tremble . The moon , so bright it had no face , was framed by the skylight and for an hour of insomnia burned in the center of her forehead like a jewel . Monday morning : in-and-out . A powdery blue sky the color of a hymnal . Sunshine broken into code by puffs and schoonersWelcome to Tarbox : 47of cumulus .

She had spread her plaid blanket in the corner where she had tacked reflecting sheets of aluminum broiling foil to the balustrade . Piet took off his suede apricot windbreaker and sank down . The sun , tepid and breezy to a standing man , burned the skin of his broad face and dyed his retinas red . " Bliss , " he said . She resumed her place on the blanket and her forearm touched his : the touch felt like a fine grade of sandpaper with a little warm sting of friction left . She was in only underwear . He got up on his elbow and kissed her belly , flat and soft and hot , and remembered his mother 's ironing board and how she would have him lay his earaches on its comforting heat ; he put his ear against Georgene 's belly and overheard a secret squirm of digestion . Still attentive to the sun , she fingered his hair and fumblingly measured his shoulders . She said , " You have too many clothes on . " His voice came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have time .

Giving the sun his turn : whore . The reflecting foil decorated her face with parabolic dabs and nebulae and spurts : solar jism . Piet jealously shucked his shoes and socks and trousers , leaving his underpants , Paisley drawers . He was a secret dandy . He lay down beside her and when she turned to face him reached around and undid her bra , explaining , " Twins , " meaning they should both be dressed alike , in only underpants . Her breasts were smaller than Angela 's , with sunken paler nipples , and , uncovered , seemed to cry for protection . He brought his chest against hers for covering and they lay together beneath the whispering trees , Hansel and Gretel abandoned .

Piet stroke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spine from the knucklelike bones at the nape of her neck to the strangely prominent coccyx . Georgene had the good start of a tail . She was more bone than Angela .

Before their affair , he had ignored Georgene . She had been hidden from him by his contempt for her husband . His , and Angela 's , dislike of Freddy Thorne had been immediate , though50 COUPLESin their first years in Tarbox the Thornes as a couple had rather courted them .

It was Freddy who told the Whitmans you were a bad contractor . " " Of course . The jerk . " " You should n't hate him . " " It keeps me young . " " But do you think he does know , about us ? Freddy . " Her curiosity insulted him ; he wanted her to dismiss FreddyWelcome to Tarbox : 51utterly . He said , " Not as a fact . But maybe by osmosis ? Bea Guerin implied to me the other night that everybody knows . " " Did you admit it ? " " Of course not . What 's the matter ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A thin bit of light lay balanced across one eyelid , trembling ; a stir of wind was rippling the sheets of foil , creating excited miniature thunder . She said carefully , " He tells me I must have somebody else because I do n't want him as much as I used to . He feels threatened . And if he had to write up a list of who it might be , I guess you 'd be at the top . But for some reason he does n't draw the conclusion . Maybe he knows and thinks he 's saving it to use later . " This frightened him , altered the tone of his body . She felt thisand opened her eyes ; their Coke-bottle green was flecked withwilt . Her pupils in the sun were as small as the core of a pencil . He asked her , " Is it time to break off ? " When challenged , Georgene , the daughter of a Philadelphia banker , would affect a playful immigrant accent , part shopgirl , part vamp. " bunt be zilly , fella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed her pelvis against his , so that through his cotton he felt her silk . She held him as if captive . Her smooth arms were strong ; she could beat him at tennis , for a set . He wrestled against her hold and in the struggle her breasts were freed , swung bulbous above him , then spilled flat when , knees on thighs and hands on wrists , he pinned her on her back . Tarpaper . Her glistening skin gazed . Wounded by winning , he bowed his head and with suppliant lips took a nipple , faintly salt and sour , in . Suddenly she felt to be all circles , circles that could be parted to yield more circles . Birds chirped beyond the rainbow rim of the circular wet tangency holding him secure . Her hand , feathery , established another tangency , located his core . If her touch could be believed , his balls were all velvet , his phallus sheer silver . Politely he asked , " Do we have on too many clothes ? " The politeness was real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them a code of mutual consideration . Their adultery was divided precisely in half . By daring to mention their breaking up , by rebuking her with this possibility , Piet had asked52 COUPLESGeorgene to cross the line . Now it was her turn to ask , and his to cross . She said , " What about those trees on Indian Hill ? " " They can fall without me , " he said . The sun was baking a musty cidery smell from the drift of needles near his face , by the blanket 's edge . The tarpaper scintillated . Good quality : Ruberoid Rolled Roofing , mineralized , $4.25 a roll in 196o . He had laid this deck . He added , " I 'm not sure you can . " " Oh I 'm not so fallen , " Georgene said , and quickly sat up , and , kneeling , flauntingly stretched her arms to the corners of the sky . She possessed , this conscientious clubwoman and firm mother , a lovely unexpected gift . Her sexuality was guileless . As formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had the directness of eating , the ease of running . Her insides were innocent . She had never had an affair before and , though Piet did not understand the virtue she felt in him , he doubted that she would ever take another lover . She had no love of guilt . In the beginning , deciding upon adultery with her , Piet had prepared himself for terrible sensations of remorse , as a diver in midair anticipates the underwaterrush and roar . Instead , the first time  --  it was September : apples in the kitchen , children off at school , except for Judy , who was asleep  --  Georgene led him lightly by one finger upstairs to her bed . They deftly undressed , she him , he her . When he worriedabout contraception , she laughed . Did n't Angela use Enovid yet ? Welcome , she said , to the post-pill paradise , a lighthearted blasphemy that immensely relieved him . With Angela the act of love had become overlaid with memories of his clumsiness and her failure to tolerate clumsiness , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implicit in tact , her equal disdain of his pajama-clad courting and his naked rage , his helpless transparenceand her opaque disenchantment . Georgene in twenty minutes stripped away these laminations of cross-purpose and showed him something primal . Now she kneeled under the sun and Piet rose to be with her and with extreme care , as if setting the wafery last cogwheels of a watch into place , kissed the glossy point of her left shoulder bone , and then of her right . She was double everywhere but in her mouths . All things double . Without duality , entropy . The universe God 's mirror . Welcome to Tarbox 53She said , " You 're in my sun . " " It 's too soon to have a tan . " Politely : " Would you like to go inside ? " The sliding glass door led off the sun deck through a playroom into their big bedroom , a room adorned with Chinese lanterns and African masks and carved animal horns from several countries . Their house , a gambrel-roof late-Victorian , with gingerbread eaves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spouting , and a roof of rose slates in graduated ranks , was furnished in a style of cheerful bastardy  --  hulking black Spanish chests , Chippendale highboys veneered in contrasting fruitwoods flaking bit by bit , nondescript slab-and-tube modern , souvenirshopcolonial , Hitchcock chairs with missing rungs , art nouveau rockers , Japanese prints , giant corduroy pillows , Philippine carpetswoven of rush rosettes . Unbreakable as a brothel , it was a good house for a party . Through his illicit morning visits Piet came to know these rooms in another light , as rooms children lived in and left littered with breakfast crumbs as they fled down the driveway to the school bus , the Globe still spread open to the funnies on the floor . Gradually the furniture  --  the antic lamps , the staring masks  --  learned to greet him , the sometimes man of the house . Proprietorially he would lie on the Thornes ' king-size double bed , his bare toes not touching the footboard , while Georgene had her preparatory shower . Curiously he would finger and skim through Thorne 's bedside shelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Modern Library , Our Lady of the Flowers and Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure fresh from Grove Press , inspirational psychology by the Menningers , a dove-gray handbook on hypnosis , Psychopathia Sexualis in textbookformat , a delicately tinted and stiff-paged album smuggled from Kyoto , the poems of Sappho as published by Peter Pauper , the unexpurgated Arabian Nights in two boxed volumes , works by Theodor Reik and Wilhelm Reich , various tawdry paperbacks . Then Georgene would come in steaming from the bathroom , a purple towel turbaned around her head . She surprised him by answering , " Let 's make it outdoors for a change . " 54  --  C O U P L E S Piet felt he was still being chastised . " Wo n't we embarrass God ? " " Have n't you heard , God 's a woman ? Nothing embarrasses Her . " She pulled the elastic of his underpants toward her , eased it down and around . Her gaze became complacent . A cloud pas- singly blotted the sun . Sensing and fearing a witness , Piet looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unperturbed onward motion of the fleet of bluebellied clouds , ships with a single destination . The little eclipsing cloud burned gold in its tendrilous masts and stern . A cannon discharge of iridescence , and it passed . Passed on safely above him . Sun was renewed in bold shafts on the cracked April earth , the sodden autumnal leaves , the new shoots coral in the birches and mus- tard on the larch boughs , the dropped needles drying , the tar- paper , their discarded clothes . Between the frilled holes her underpants wore a tender honey stain . Between her breasts the sweat was scintillant and salt . He encircled her , fingered and licked her willing slipping tips , the pip within the slit , wisps . Sun and spittle set a cloudy froth on her pubic hair : Piet pie- turcd a kitten learning to drink milk from a saucer . He hurried , seeking her forgiveness , for his love of her , on the verge of discharge , had taken a shadow , had become regretful , foregone . 1 1e parted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed . A lip of resistance , then an easeful deepness , a slip- ping by steps . His widening entry slowly startled her eyes . For fear of finding her surrendered face plain , he closed his lids . The whispering of boughs filtered upon them . Distant saws rasped . The breeze teased his squeezing buttocks ; he was both- ered by hearing birds behind him , Thorne 's hired choir , spying . " Oh , sweet . Oh so sweet , " Georgene said . Piet dared peek and saw her rapt lids veined with broken purple and a small saliva bubble welling at one corner of her lips . He suffered a dizzying impression of waste . Though thudding , his heart went mournful . He bit her shoulder , smooth as an orange in sun , and traveled along a muffled parabola whose red warm walls she was and at whose end she also waited . Her face snapped sideways ; drenched feathers pulled his tip ; oh . So good a girl , to be there for him , no matter how he fumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange space he leaped , and leaped again . She said , " Oh . " Lavender she lay in his shadow , the corners of her lips flecked . Politely Piet asked her , " Swing ? " " Dollink . Dunt esk . " " I was sort of poor . I 'm not used to this outdoor living . " Georgene shrugged under him . Her throat and shoulders were slick . A speck of black construction dust , granular tar from his hair , adhered to her cheek . " You were you . I love you . I love you inside me . " Piet wanted to weep , to drop fat tears onto her deflated breasts . " Did I feel big enough ? " She laughed , displaying perfect teeth , a dentist 's wife . " No , " she said . " You felt shrimpy . " Seeing him ready , in his dilated suspended state , to believe it , she explained solemnly , " You hurt me , you know . I ache afterwards . " " Do I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . But you should complain . " " It 's in a good cause . Now get off me . Go to Indian Hill . " Discarded beside her , he felt as weak and privileged as a child . Plucking needs agitated his fingers , his mouth . He asked at her side , " What did Freddy say about me that was mean ? " " He said you were expensive and slow . " " Well . I suppose that could be true . " He began dressing . The birds ' chirping had become a clock 's ticking . Like butter on a bright sill her nakedness was going rancid . She lay as she must often lie , accepting the sun entirely . The bathing-suit boundaries were not distinct on her body , as on Angela 's . Her kitten-chin glutinous with jism . The plaid blanket had been rumpled and pulled from under her head , and some larch needles adhered to her hair , black mixed with gray . Because of this young turning of her hair she kept it feather-cut short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the whispering silence surrounding his dressing , " I do n't care about Freddy . I do n't want the Whitmans ' job . Cut into these old houses you never know what you 'll find . Gallagher thinks we 've wasted too much time restoring old heaps for our friends and the friends of our friends . He wants56 COUPLESthree new ranch houses on Indian Hill by fall . The war babies are growing up . That 's where the money is . " " Money , " she said . " You 're beginning to sound like the rest of them . " " Well , " he told her . " I ca n't be a virgin forever . Corruption had to come even to me . " He was dressed . The cool air drew tight around his shoulders and he put on his apricot windbreaker . With the manners that rarely lapsed between them , she escorted him from her house . He admired and yet was slightly scandalized that she could walk so easily , naked , through doors , past her children 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelf of cleansing agents , into her polished kitchen , to the side door . This side of the house , where the firewood was stacked and a single great elm cast down a gentle net of shade , had about it something rural and mild unlike the barbaric bulk of the house . Here not a brick or stone walk but a path worn through grass , now muddy , led around the corner of the garage , where Piet had hidden his pick-up truck , a dusty olive Chevrolet on whose tailgate a child had written WASH ME . Georgene , barefoot , did not step down from the threshold but leaned silent and smiling in the open doorway , leaving framed in Piet 's mind a complex impression : of a domestic animal , of a fucked woman , of a mocking boy , of farewell . Next Sunday , a little past noon , when Foxy had just returned from church and with a sigh had dropped her veiled hat onto the gate-legged table where the telephone sat , it impudently rang . She knew the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all week and therefore was prepared , though they had never really spoken , to recognize his voice , more hesitant and respectful than that of the other local men , with a flattish blurred midwestern intonation . He asked to speak to Ken . She went into the kitchen and deliberately did n't listen , because she wanted to . All week she had been unable against Ken 's silent resistance to call the contractor , and now her hands trembled as if guiltily . She poured herself a glass of dry vermouth . Really , church was getWelcometo Tarbox : 57ting to be , as the weather grew finer , a sacrifice . Magnolia buds swollen by heat leaned in the space of air revealed by the tilted ventilation pane of commemorative stained glass , birds sang in the little late-Victorian cemetery between the church and the river , the sermon dragged , the pews cracked restlessly . Ken came back from the phone saying , " He asked me to play basketball at two o'clock at his place . " Basketball was the one sport Ken had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Harvard house , which he had told her as a confession , it had been so unfashionable to do . Foxy said , " How funny . " " Apparently he has a basket on his barn wall , with a little asphalt court . He said in the spring , between skiing and tennis , some of the men like to play . They need me to make six , for three on a side . " " Did you say you would ? " " I thought you wanted to go for a walk on the beach . " " We can do that any time . I could walk by myself . " " Do n't be a martyr . What is that , dry vermouth ? " " Yes . I developed a taste for it at the Guerins ' . " " And then do n't forget we have Ned and Gretchen tonight . " " They wo n't get here until after eight , you know how arrogant Cambridge people are . Call him back and tell him you 'll play , it 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I left it that I might show up . " Foxy laughed , delighted at having been deceived . " Well if you told him yes why are you being so sneaky about it ? " " I should n't leave you here alone all afternoon . " Because you 're pregnant , the implication was . His oppressive concern betrayed him . They had gone childless too long ; he feared this change and added weight . Foxy made herself light , showed herself gay . " Ca n't I come along and watch ? I thought this was a wives ' town . " Foxy was the only wife who came to basketball , and Angela Hanema came out of the house to keep her company . The day58 , C O U P L E S was agreeable for being outdoors ; nothing in the other woman 's manner asked for an apology . The two together carried a bench , a weathered moist settee with a spindle-rung back , from beside the barn to a spot on the gravel driveway where simultaneously they could see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keep an eye on the many children running and hiding in the big square yard and the lacy screen of budding woods beyond . Foxy asked , " Whose children are all these ? " " Two are ours , two girls . You can see one of them standing by the birdbath sucking her thumb . That 's Nancy . " " Is thumb-sucking bad ? " It was a question probably naive , another mother would n't have asked it , but Foxy was curious and felt she could hardly embarrass herself with Angela , who seemed so graceful and serenely humorous . " It 's not aesthetic , " she said . " She did n't do it as an infant , it just started last winter . She 's worried about death . I do n't know where she gets it from . Pict insists on taking them to Sunday school and maybe they talk about it there . " " I suppose they feel they should . " " I suppose . The other children you sec  --  the happy loud ones belong to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their proud daddies . " " I do n't know all the daddies . I see Harold  --  why is it little- Smith ? " " It 's one of those jokes that nobody knows how to get rid of . There were some other Smiths in town once , but they 've long left . " " And that big imposing one is our real-estate man . " " Matt Gallagher . My husband 's partner . The bouncy one with red hair is my husband . " Foxy thought , how funny that he is . She said , " He was at the Applebys ' party for us . " " We all were . The one with the beard and grinning is Ben Saltz . S-a-l-t-z . I think it 's been shortened from something . " " He looks very diabolical , " Foxy said . " Not to me . I think the effect is supposed to be rakish but it comes out Amish . It 's to cover up pockmarks ; when we first moved to town it was bushier but now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a terribly kind , uxorious man . Irene is the moving spirit behind the League and the Fair Housing group and whatever else does good in town . Ben works in one of those plants along 128 that look as though they make ice cream . " " I thought that was a Chinaman . " " Korean . That 's John Ong . He 's not here . The only things he plays are chess and very poor tennis . His chess is quite good , though , Freddy Thorne tells me . He 's a nuclear physicist who works in MIT . At MIT ? Actually , I think he works under MIT , in a huge underground workshop you need a password to get into . " Foxy asked , " With a cyclotron ? " Angela said , " I forget your husband 's a scientist too . I have no idea . Neither he nor Ben can ever talk about their work because it 's all for the government . It makes everybody else feel terribly excluded . I think a little tiny switch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He miniaturizes . He once showed us some radios that were like fingernails . " " At the party , I tried to talk to  --  who , Ong ?  --  you all have such funny names . " " But are n't all names funny until you get used to them ? Think of Shakespeare and Churchill . Think of Pillsbury . " " Anyway I tried to talk and could n't understand a word . " " I know . His consonants are not what you expect . He was some kind of booty in the Korean War ; I ca n't believe he defected , he does n't seem to have that kind of opinion . He was very big with them I guess ; for a while he taught at Johns Hopkins and met Bernadette in Baltimore . If they ever dropped an H-bomb on Tarbox it would be because of him . Like the Watertown arsenal . But you 're right . He 's not sexy . " Her tone implied a disdain of sex mixed with the equanimous recognition that others might chose to steer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale in the sunlight , composed around the premeditation of a smile , Foxy felt as if she , Foxy , were looking up toward a luxurious detached realm where observations and impressions drifted nodding by one another like strolling aristo-6o COUPLES Welcome to Tarbox 61crats . Every marriage tends to consist of an aristocrat and a peasant . Of a teacher and a learner . Foxy , though by more than an inch the taller , felt beneath Angela , as a student , at once sheltered and challenged . Discovering herself blushing , she hastily asked , " Who 's the quick one with the ghostly eyes ? " " I guess they are ghostly . I 've always thought of them as steely but that 's wrong . His name is Eddie Constantine . He 's an airline pilot . They just moved a year or so ago into a grim big house on the green . The tall teen-ager who looks like the Apollo Belvedere is a neighbor 's boy he brought along in case there were n't six . Piet did n't know if your husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made the sides uneven ? " " Not at all , they 're delighted to have another player . Basketball is n't very popular , you ca n't do it with women . He 's very good . Your husband . " Foxy watched . The neighbor boy , graceful even ill at ease , was standing aside while the six grown men panted and heaved , ducked and dribbled . They looked clumsy , crowded on the little piece of asphalt whose edges fell off into mud softened and stamped by sneaker footprints . Ken and Gallagher were the tallest and she saw Ken , whose movements had a certain nice economy she had not seen displayed for years , lift the ball to the level of his forehead and push it off . It swirled around the rim and flew away , missing . This pleased her : why ? He had looked so confident , his whole nicely poised body had expressed the confidence , that it would go in . Constantine seized the rebound and dribbled down low , protecting the ball with an outward elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His eyes in their ghostly transparence suggested photographic paper now silver , now black , now clear , depending upon in what they were dipped . His sharp features flushed , little-Smith kept slapping his feet as if to create confusion . He had none of the instinctive moves and Foxy wondered why he played . Saltz , whom she was prepared to adore , moved on the fringes cautiously , stooped and smiling as if to admit he was in a boys ' game . His backside was broad and instead of sneakers he wore black laced shoes , such as peek from beneath a priest 's robe . As she watched , Hanema , abruptly fierce , stole the ball fromConstantine , braving his elbow , pushed past Ken in a way that must be illegal , hipped and hopped and shot . When the ball went in he jumped for a joke on Gallagher 's back . The Irishman , his jaws so wide his face was pentagonal , sheepishly carried his partneron a jog once around the asphalt . " Discontinuous , " Saltz was protesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constantine said . " You are an unscrupulous bastard . " Their voices were adolescently shrill . " All right crybabies , I wo n't play , " Hanema said , and waved the waiting boy into his place . " Shall I call Thorne to come and make four on a side ? " Nobody answered ; play had already resumed . Hanema draped a sweater around his neck and came and stood above the watching pair of women . Foxy could not study his face , a circular purple shadow against the sun . A male scent , sweat , flowed from him . His grainy courtly voice asked his wife , " Shall I call Thorne or do you want to ? He 's your friend . " Angela answered , " It 's rude to call him this late , he 'll wonder why you did n't call him sooner . " Her voice , lifted toward the man , sounded diminished to Foxy , frightened . He said , " You ca n't be rude to Thorne . If rudeness bothered him he 'd have left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a five-martini lunch and could n't have come earlier . " " Call him then , " Angela said . " And say hello to Foxy . " " Pardon me . How are you , Mrs. Whitman ? " " Well , thank you , Mr. Hanema . " She was determined not to be frightened also , and felt that she was not . Sun rimmed his skull with rainbow filaments . He remained an upright shadow in front of her , emanating heat , but his voice altered , checked by something in hers . " It 's very endearing , " he said , and repeated , " endearing of you to come and be an audience . We need an audience . " And his sudden explosion of energy , his bumping of Ken , his leap to Gallagher 's back , were lit in retrospectby the fact of her watching . He had done it for her to see . " You all seem very energetic , " Foxy said . " I 'm impressed . " He asked her , " Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , " she answered , wondering if he knew that she was pregnant , remembering him looking up her skirt , and guessing that he did . He would make it his business to know . " In that case I better call Thorne , " he said , and went into his house . Angela , her casual manner restored , told Foxy , " Women sometimesdo play . Janet and Georgene are actually not too bad . At least they look to me as if they know what they 're doing . " Foxy said , " Field hockey is my only game . " " What position did you play ? I was center halfback . " " You played ? I was right inner , usually . Sometimes wing . " " It 's a lovely game , " Angela said . " It was the one time in my life when I enjoyed being aggressive . It 's what men must have a lot of the time . " There was a flow and an authority in the driftingway she spoke that led Foxy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower into a salmon overcast . Keeping their pale faces lifted to the pale light , they talked , these two , of hockey ( " What I liked about halfback , " Angela said , " was you were both offensiveand defensive and yet nobody could blame you for anything . " ) ; of sports in general ( " It 's so good , " Foxy said , " to see Ken playing at anything . I think being with students all the time makes you unnecessarily old . I felt ancient in Cambridge . " ) ; of Ken 's profession ( " He never talks to me about his work any more , " Foxy said . " It used to be starfish and that was sort of fun , we went to Woods Hole one summer ; but now it 's more to do with chlorophyll and all the breakthroughs recently have been in other fields , DNA and whatnot. " ) ; of Piet 's house ( " He likes it , " Angela said , " because everything is square . I loved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with it , and the way it floats above the marsh ! Piet was worried about mosquitoes . Here we have these terrible horseflies from the dairy . He 's from inland , you know . I think the sea intimidates him . He likes to skate but is n't much of a swimmer . He thinks the sea is wasteful . I think I prefer things to be somewhat formless . Piet likes them finished . " ) ; and of the children who now and then emerged from the woods and brought them a wound , a complaint , a gift : " Why , Franklin , thank you ! What do you think it can be ? " Welcome to Tarbox : 63 " A coughball , " the boy said . " From an owl or a hawk . " The boy was eight or nine , intelligent but slow to form , and thinskinned . The coughball lay in Angela 's hand , smaller than a golf ball , a tidy dry accretion visibly holding small curved bones . " It 's beautiful in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me to do with it ? " " Keep it for me until they take me home . Do n't let Ruthie have it . She says it 's hers because it 's her woods but I want to start a collection and I saw it first even though she did pick it up . " Making this long statement brought the child close to tears . Angela said , " Frankie , go tell Ruth to come see me . " He blinked and turned and ran . Foxy said , " Is n't that Frankie Appleby ? But Frank himself is n't here . " " Harold brought him . He 's friends with their Jonathan . " " I thought the Smith boy was years older . " " He is , but of course they 're thrown together . " Of course ? Three children returned from the woods  --  four , counting little Nancy Hanema , who hung back near the birdbath and , thumb in mouth , fanned her fingers as if to hide her face from Foxy 's gaze . Ruth was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with indignant energy . " Mother , he says he saw it first but he did n't see it at all until I picked it up . Then he said it was his because he saw it first . " The taller boy , with a clever flickering expression , said , " That 's the truth , Mrs. Hanema . Old Franklin Fink here grabs every-thing . " Young Appleby , without preamble , broke into sobs . " I do n't , " he said , and would have said more , but his throat stuck shut . " Boo hoo , Finkie , " the Smith boy said . " Mother , " Ruth said , stamping her foot on the gravel to retrieveAngela 's attention . " Last summer we found a bird 's nest and Frankie said it was his for a collection and grabbed it out of my hand and it all came apart and fell into nothing , all because of him ! " She flounced so hard her straight hair fanned in space . Jonathan little-Smith said , " Lookie , Finkie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gracious me oh my oh . " With a guttural whimper the younger boy attacked his friend with rotating fists . Jonathan laughed ; his arm snaked out and flipped the frantic red face aside ; he contemptuously pushed . Angela rose and parted them , and Foxy thought how graceful yet solid she looked , and imagined her as a hockey player standing abstractedyet impenetrable in the center of the limed field , in blue bloomers . Her body in turning showed a trace of the process that makes middle-aged women , with their thickened torsos and thinned legs , appear to be engaged in a balancing act . " Now Jonathan , " Angela said , holding each boy 's hand equally , " Frankie wants to start a collection . Do you want to have a collection too ? " " No I do n't give a fart about some old bird 's throw-up . It 's Ruthie he stole from . " " Ruthie is here all the time and I know she can find another in the woods . I want you all to help her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods and if you find his tree I bet you 'll find lots more coughballs . You help too , Nancy . " The child had approached closer . " Mouse died , " she said , not removing her thumb . " Yes , " Ruth said , wheeling , her hair lifting winglike , " and if you do n't watch out this enormous owl will come and eat you and your thumb will be sticking out from an enormous coughball with eyes on it ! " " Ruth ! " Angela called , too late . Ruth had run back to the woods , her long legs flinging beneath her flying skirt . The boys , united by need for pursuit , followed . Nancy came to her mother 's lap and was absent-mindedly caressed . " You have all this , " Angela said to Foxy , " to look forward to . " Her pregnancy , then , was common knowledge . She discovered she did n't mind . She said , " I 'll be glad when it 's at that stage . I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Later , " Angela said , " it 's splendid . You 're so right with the world . Then this little package arrives , and it 's utterly dependent , with these very clear sharp needs that you can satisfy ! You have everything it wants . I loved having babies . But then you have toWelcome to Tarbox : 65raise them . " The eyes of the child half lying in her lap listened wide open . Her lips around her thumb made a secret , moist noise . " You 're very good with children , " Foxy told her . " I like to teach , " Angela said . " It 's easier than learning . " With a splashing sound of gravel , a yellow convertible , top down , came into the driveway and stopped not a yard from their bench . The Thorne man was driving ; his pink head poked from the metal shell like the flesh of a mollusc . Standing in the back seat were a sickly-looking boy who resembled him and a younger girl , six or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jarred by the readiness with which Angela rose to greet them . After an hour of sharing a bench and the sun with her , she was jealous . Angela introduced the children : " Whitney and Martha Thorne , say hello to Mrs. Whitman . " " I know you , " the boy told her . " You moved in down the road from us into the spook house . " His face was pale and his nostrils and ears seemed inflamed . Possibly he had a fever . His sister was definitely fat . She found herself touched by these children and , lifting her eyes to their father , even by him . " Is it a spook house ? " she asked . " He means , " Angela intervened , " because it stood empty so long . The children can see it from the beach . " " All shuttered up , " Whitney said , " with smoke coming out of the chimneys . " " The kid hallucinates , " his father said . " He chews peyote for breakfast . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some guys snuck up on the porch one time and heard voices inside . " " Just a little innocent teen-age fucking , " Freddy Thorne said , squinting at the sallow spring sun . By daylight his amorphous softness was less menacing , more pitiable . He wore a fuzzy claret sports shirt with an acid-green foulard and hightop all-weather boots such as children with weak ankles wear . " Hey , big Freddy , " Harold little-Smith called from the basketballcourt . The thumping and huffing had suspended . " It 's Bob Cousy ! " Hanema called from the porch . " Looks more like Goose Tatum to me , " said Gallagher . " You66 : COUPLEScan always tell by de whites ob dare eyes . " " What whites ? " Hanema asked . He hurried over and , taking Thorne by the elbow , announced , " This man is living gin . " " Those are not official sneakers , " Ben Saltz protested . " Those are Frankenstein shoes , " Eddie Constantine said . He went mock-rigid and tottered the few steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thorne 's breath , clutched his own throat , and screamed , " Aagh ! The fumes ! The fumes ! " Thorne smiled and wiped his mouth . " I 'll just watch , " he said . " You do n't need me , you got plenty of people . Why did you call ? " " We do need you , " Hanema insisted , handling the man 's elbow again and seeming to exult in his relative shortness . " Four on a side . You guard me . You belong to Matt , Eddie , and Ben . " " Thanks a holy arse-licking bunch , " Constantine said . " How many points are you spotting us ? " Gallagher asked . " None , " Hanema said . " Freddy will he all right . He 's an asset . He 's loose . Take a practice shot , Freddy . " He slammed the ball off the asphalt into ' Ilhorne 's stomach . " Sec how loose he is ? " From the stiff-fingered way Thorne handled the ball Foxy saw he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so flat-footed , she averred her eyes from the sight . Beside her , Angela said , " I suppose the house may have been broken into by a few young couples . They have so few places to go . " " What were the people like who owned it before ? " " The Robinsons . We hardly knew them . They only used it summers and weekends . A middle-aged couple with pots of childrenwho suddenly got divorced . I used to see her downtown with binoculars around her neck . Quite a handsome woman with hair in a bun and windburn in tweeds . He was an ugly little man with a huge voice , always threatening to sue the town if they widened the road to the beach . But Bernadette Ong , who knew them , says it was he who wanted the divorce . Evidently he played the cello and she the violin and they got into a string quartet with some people from Duxbury . They never did a thing for the house . " Welcome to Tarbox : 67Foxy blurted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house for us ? And give us an estimate or some notion as to where to begin ? " Angela gazed toward the woods , a linear maze where children 's bodies were concealed . " Matt , " she said carefully , " wants Piet to concentrate on building new houses . " " Perhaps he could recommend another contractor then . We must make a beginning . Ken seems to like the house as it is but when winter comes it will be impossible . " " Of course it will . " The curtness startled Foxy . Gazing toward the trees , Angela went on hesitatingly , as if her choice of words were distracted by a flowering of things unseen . " Your husband  --  perhaps he and Piet could talk . Not today after basketball . Everybody stays for beer . " " No , fine . We must hurry back , we have some friends coming from Cambridge . " Thus a gentle rift was established between them . The two faced differently , Angela toward the woods full of children and Foxy toward the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The court , now deep in the shadow of the barn , was crowded and Thorne , with his protrusive rear and confused motions , was in everyone 's way . Hanema had the ball . Persistently bumped by Thorne in his attempts to dribble amid a clamor of shouts , he passed the ball on the bounce to the Constantines ' neighbor 's boy ; in the same stride he hooked one foot around Thorne 's ankle and by a backwards stab of his weight caused the bigger man to fall down . Thorne fell in stages , thrusting out an arm , then rolling face down on the muddy asphalt , his hand under him . Play stopped . Foxy and Angela ran to the men . Hanema had kneeled to Thorne . The others made a hushed circle around them . Smearily smiling , his claret shirt muddy , Thorne sat up and showed them a trembling hand whose whitened little finger stuck out askew . " Dislocated , " he said in a voice from which pain had squeezed all elasticity . Hanema , kneeling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is terrible . Sue me . " " It 's happened before , " Thorne said . He took the injured hand68 COUPLES Welcome to Tarbox  --  69in his good one and grimaced and pulled . A snap softer than a twig breaking , more like a pod popping , shocked the silent circle . Freddy rose and held his hand , the little finger now aligned , before his chest as something tender and disgraced that must not be touched . He asked Angela , " Do you have surgical tape and anything for a splint  --  a tongue depressor , a popsicle stick ? Even a spoon would do . " Rising with him , Hanema asked , " Freddy , will you be able to work ? " Thorne smirked down at the other 's anxious face . He was feeling his edge enlarge , Foxy felt ; she thought only women used their own pain as a weapon . " Oh , " he said , " after a month or so . I ca n't go into somebody 's mouth wearing a plaster cast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . His face was a strange stretched mixture of freckles and pallor , of the heat of battle and contrition . The other players had divided equally into two sympathizing rings . Freddy Thorne , holding his hand before him , led Angela and Constantine and the neighbor boy and Saltz into the house , in triumph . Yet Foxy 's impression remained that he had been , in the minute before exploitation set in , instinctively stoical . " You did n't do it on purpose , " little-Smith told Hanema . Foxy wondered why he , Thorne 's friend , had stayed outdoors , with the guilty . The patterns of union were many . " But I did , " Piet said . " I deliberately tripped the poor jerk . The way he bumps with his belly gets me mad . " Gallagher said , " He does n't understand the game . " Gallagher would have been handsome but for something narrowed about the mouth , something predetermined and closed expressed by the bracketlike creases emphasizing the corners : prim tucks . Amid the whiskery Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass . She said , " I think you 're all awfully rough with each other . " " C'est la guerre , " little-Smith told her . Ken , in the lull , was practicing shots , perfecting himself . Foxy felt herself submerged in shadows and cross-currents while he was on high , willfully ignorant , hollow and afloat . His dribbling and the quivering rattle of the rim irritated her like any monologue . Hanema was beside her . Surprisingly , he said , " I hate being a shit and that 's how it keeps turning out . I beg him to come play and then I cripple him . " It was part confession , part brag . Foxy was troubled that he would bring her this , as if laying his head in her lap . She shied , speechless , angered that , having felt from an unexpected angle his rumored force , his orphan 's needful openness , she had proved timid , like Angela . The gravel driveway splashed again . An old maroon coupe pulled in , its windshield aswarm with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the driver 's side . She carried two sixpacks of beer . Georgene Thorne pushed from the other door holding in her arms a child of a cumbersome age , so wadded with clothes its legs were spread like the stalks of an H. By the scorched redness of its cheeks the child was an Appleby . Little-Smith and Hanema quickly went to greet them . Gallagherjoined Ken at shooting baskets . Not wishing to eavesdrop , yet believing her sex entitled her to join the women , Foxy walked slowly down the drive to them as little-Smith caperingly describedFreddy 's unfortunate finger  --  " le doigt disloque . " Georgene said , " Well , I 've told him not to try sports when he 's potted . " Her upper lids were pink , as if she had been lying in the sun . Piet Hanema told her , " But I asked him especially to come , so the could have four on a side . " Such a sad broad face , growing old without wisdom , alert and strained . " Oh , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd sit around all Sunday afternoon with just me . " " Why not ? " Piet said , and Foxy imagined hostility in his eyes as he gazed at her . " Do n't you want to go inside and see how he is ? " He 's all right , " she said . " Is n't Angela with him ? Let them alone . He 's happy . " Janet and Harold were conferring urgently , in whispers . Their conversation seemed logistical , involving schedules and placement of cars and children . When the Appleby infant seized a cat on the lawn and tried to lift it by its hindquarters , as if spilling a bag of candy out , it was little-Smith who went and pried it loose , while70 COUPLESJanet held her face in this idle moment up to the sun . The cat , calico , with a mildewed eye , ran off and hid in the lilac hedge . Foxy asked Hanema , " Is that yours ? " " The cat or the child ? " he asked , as if also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The calico cat . We have a cat called Cotton . " " Do bring Cotton to the next basketball game , " Georgene Thorne said . She added , throwing an athletic arm toward the woods , " I ca n't see the children for the trees , " as if this explained the rudeness of her first remark , with its implied indignation at Foxy 's being here at all . Hanema explained , " She belongs to the dairy down the road but the children sometimes feed it . They let the damn thing into the house full of fleas and now I have them . " Freddy Thorne came out of the house . His little finger was bandaged to a green plastic picnic spoon . The pad of his fingertip rested prettily in the bowl and the curve of the handle made a very dainty fit . That Angela had improvised this strengthened Foxy 's sense of illicit affection between these two . Freddy was plainly proud . " Oh Freddy , " Janet said , " it 's just gorgeous . " She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pelvis . The nap of her turquoise velour jersey changed tint as it rounded the curve of her breasts ; as she moved her front was an electric shimmer of shadow . The neck was cut to reveal a slash of mauve skin . Her lips had been painted to be a valentine but her chalky face needed sleep . Like her son she was thin-skinned and still being formed . Freddy said , " The kid did it . " Constantine 's young neighbor explained , " At camp last summerwe had to take First Aid . " His voice emerged reedy and shallow from manhood 's form : a mouse on a plinth . Eddie Constantine said , " He comes over to the house and massages Carol 's back . " Freddy asked , " Oh . She has a bad back ? " " Only when I 've been home too long . " Ken and Gallagher stopped playing and joined the grown-ups . Welcome to Tarbox : 71The sixpacks were broken open and beer cans were passed around . " I despise these new tabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know has cut thumbs . It 's the new stigmata . " Foxy felt him grope for the French for " stigmata . " Janet said , " I ca n't do it , I 'm too weak and hung . Could you ? " She handed her can to  --  Ken ! All eyes noticed . Harold little-Smith 's nose tipped up and his voice rose nervously . " Freddy Thorne , " he taunted . " Spoonfinger . The man with the plastic digit . Le doigt plastique . " " Freddy , honestly , what a nuisance , " Georgene said , and Foxy felt hidden in this an attempt to commiserate . " No kidding , " Constantine said , " how will you get in there ? Those little crevices between their teeth ? " He was frankly curiousand his eyes , which Foxy for a moment saw full on , echoed , in the absence of intelligence , aluminum and the gray of wind and the pearly width low in the sky at high altitudes . He had been there , in the metallic vastness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would get to where he had to go . " With a laser beam , " Thorne said , and the green spoon became a death ray that he pointed , saying zizz between his teeth , at Constantine , at Hanema , at herself . " Zizz . Die . Zizz . You 're dead . " The people nearest him laughed excessively . They were courtiers , and Freddy was a king , the king of chaos : though struck dead , Foxy refused to laugh . At her back , Georgene and Piet , ignoring Freddy , exchanged words puzzling in their grave sim-plicity : " How are you ? " " So-so , dollink . " " You 've been on your sunporch . " " Yes . " " How was it ? Lovely ? " " Lonely . " Overhearing , Foxy was rapt , as when a child she listened to her parents bumbling and grunting behind a closed door , intimacy giving their common words an exalted magic . Ben Saltz 's voice overenunciated ; his moving lips had an air72 COUPLESof isolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his beard . He was saying , " All kidding aside , Freddy , they really can do great things now with nontactile dentistry . " " Whoops , " Freddy Thorne said , " that lets tactile types like me out , " and he slapped the biform seat of Janet 's tense white pants . She whirled from cozying with Ken to give Freddy a look less of surprise than of warning , a warning , Foxy felt , that had to do less with the pat than with its being witnessed . Saltz seized the chance to latch on to Ken . " Tell me , if you can spare a minute , have you felt the effects of laser beams in biochemistryyet ? I was reading in the Globe the other week where they 've had some success with cancer in mice . " " Anybody can do miracles with mice , " Ken stated , ruefully staring down at Janet 's backside . He was not comfortable , Foxy had noticed years ago , talking to Jews ; he had competed unsuccessfullyagainst too many . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and tell me about DNA . How the blazes , is the way my thinking runs , how the blazes could such a complex structure spontaneously arise out of chaos ? " " Matter is n't chaos , " Ken said . " It has laws , legislated by what ca n't happen . " " I can see , " Saltz said , " how out in our western states , say , the Grand Canyon is the best example , how a rock could be carved by erosion into the shape of a cathedral . But if I look inside and see a lot of pews arranged in apple-pie order , in rows , I begin to smell a rat , so to speak . " " Maybe , " Ken said , " you put those pews there yourself . " Ben Saltz grinned . " I like that , " he said . " I like that answer . " His grin was a dazzling throwback , a facial sunburst that turned his eyes into twinkling slits , that seized his whole face like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bas-relief . " I like that answer a lot . You mean the Cosmic Unconscious . You know , Yahweh was a volcano god originally . I think it 's ridiculous for religious people to be afraid of the majesty and power of the universe . " Angela called from the porch , " Is anybody except me chilly ? Please come into the house , anybody . " This signaled some to go and some to stay . Eddie Constantine crushed his beer can double and handed it to Janet Appleby . SheWelcome to Tarbox : 73placed it above her breast , as if it were a tin corsage . He crossed to his Vespa and , passing close to Foxy , tapped her stomach . " Suck in your gut . " Those were his words . The neighbors ' boy got on the Vespa behind him , clinging possumlike . Constantine kicked off , and a spray of stones leaped from his rear wheel as he went down the drive and banked into the road beyond the lilac hedge , which was losing transparence to the swelling of buds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran silently across the lawn , elongating . Children were emerging from the darkening woods . Half of them were crying . Really , it was only Frankie Appleby crying . Jonathan Smith and Whitney Thorne had tied him to a tree with his own shoelaces and then could n't undo the knots so they had to cut them and now he had no shoelaces and it was n't his fault . His feet stumbled and flopped to illustrate and Harold little-Smith ran to him while Janet his mother stood cold , plump and pluming , on the porch gazing to where the sun , a netted orange , hung in the thin woods . Across the lawn came the rosy Hanema girls and a beautiful male child like a Gainsborough in the romantic waning light , curly black hair and a lithe **25;10014;TOOLONG . With a firm dismissing nod Gallagher took this luxurious child by the hand and led him to their car , the gray Mercedes from whose tall clean windows Foxy had first viewed Tarbox . Saltz and the Thornes moved to go in . In the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bald , bumped together and Thorne unexpectedly put his arm , the arm with the crippled green-tipped hand , around the Jew and solidly hugged him sideways . Saltz flashed upward his leonine grin and said something to which Thorne replied , " I 'm an indestructiblekind of a prick . Let me tell you about dental hypnosis . " The pleasant house accepted them . Foxy and Ken moved to go . " Do n't all leave , " Angela begged . " Would n't you like to have a real drink ? " Foxy said , " We must get back , " truly sad . She was to experiencethis sadness many times , this chronic sadness of late Sunday afternoon , when the couples had exhausted their game , basketball or beachgoing or tennis or touch football , and saw an evening weighing upon them , an evening without a game , an evening spent among flickering lamps and cranky children and leftover74 COUPLESfood and the nagging half-read newspaper with its weary portents and atrocities , an evening when marriages closed in upon themselves like flowers from which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window on Monday and the long week when they must perform again their impersonations of working men , of stockbrokers and dentists and engineers , of mothers and housekeepers , of adults who are not the world 's guests but its hosts . Janet and Harold were arguing in whispers . Janet whirled and proclaimed , " Sweet , we ca n't . We must rescue Marcia and Frank , they 're probably deep in conversation . " She and little-Smith collectedtheir scrambled children and left in her maroon car . As they backed from the driveway , the sinking sun for an instant pierced the windshield and bleached their two faces in sunken detail , like saints under glass . " Good-bye , " Piet Hanema said politely from the porch . Foxy had forgotten him . He seemed so chastened by the finger incident that she called to him , " Cheer up . " Safe in their MG , Ken said , " Zowie , I 'm going to be stiff to-morrow . " " But was n't it fun ? " " It was exercise . Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angela . " " Why ? " " I do n't know . She 's gracious and careless and above it all at the same time . She does n't make the demands on you the others do . " " She must have been a knockout once . " " But not now ? I must say , your painted friend Janet with her hug-my-bottom sailor pants does not impress me aesthetically . " " How does she impress you , Fox ? " " She impresses me as less happy than she should be . She was meant to be a jolly fat woman and somehow missed . " " Do you think she 's having an affair with Smith ? " Foxy laughed . " Men are so observant . It 's so obvious it must be passe . I think she had an affair with Smith some time ago , is having one with Thorne right now , and is sizing you up for the future . " Welcome to Tarbox . 75His flattered languid answering laugh annoyed her . " I have a confession , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saltz . God , Jews are ponderous . They care so much . The Cosmic Unconscious , Jesus . " " No . But almost as bad . I told Angela we wanted to have her husband look at our house . " His voice withdrew , acquired a judging dispassion . " Did you set a date ? " " No , but I think we should now . You should call . She did n't think he 'd be interested anyway . " Ken drove swiftly down the road they already knew by heart , so both leaned a little before the curve was there . " Well , " he said after silence , " I hope his basketball is n't a clue as to how he builds houses . He plays a pretty crusty game . " Ruth , standing beside the bed with almost a woman 's bulk , was crying and by speaking woke him from a dream in which a tall averted woman in white was waiting for him at the end of a curved corridor . " Daddy , Nancy says the dairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his cage and I 'm afraid to look . " Piet remembered the eek eeik by which he had learned to lull himself to sleep and slid from the bed with fear lumping in his stomach . Angela sighed moistly but did not stir . The floor and stairs were cold . Nancy , huddled in her pink nightie on the brown living-room sofa in the shadowless early-morning light , removed her thumb from her mouth and told him , " I did n't mean to , I did n't mean to , it was a ' stake ! " His mouth felt crusty . " Mean to what ? Where 's the animal ? " The child looked at him with eyes so pure and huge a space far bigger than this low-ceilinged room seemed windowed . The furnitureitself , surfacing from the unity of darkness , seemed to be sentient , though paralyzed . He insisted , " Where is the animal you told Ruthie about , Nancy ? " She said , " I did n't mean to , " and succumbed to tears ; her76 COUPLESsmooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , and Piet was numbed by the force that flowed through the hole her face made in the even gray light . Ruth said , " Crybaby , crybaby , sit-and-wonder-whybaby , " and Nancy plugged her face again with her thumb . The little animal , sack-shaped , lay belly up in the center of the kitchen linoleum . The dairy cat watched at a distance , both cowardly and righteous , behind the rungs of a kitchen chair . Its quick instinctive work had been nicely done . Though scarcely marked , the hamster was dead . Its body yielded with a sodden resilience to the prodding of Piet 's finger ; its upper lip was lifted to expose teeth like the teeth of a comb and its eyes , with an incongruoushuman dignity , were closed . A trace of lashes . The four curled feet . The lumpy bald nose . Ruth asked , though she was standing in the kitchen doorway and could see for herself , " Is it him ? " " Yes . Sweetie , he 's dead . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth , feeling that her pet needed more room for running , suspecting cruelty in the endless strenuousness of the wheel , not believing with her growing mind that any creature might have wits too dim to resent such captivity , had improvised around his tiny cage a larger cage of window screens she had found stacked in the attic waiting for summer . She had tied the frames together with string and Piet had never kept his promise to make her a stronger cage . Several times the hamster had nosed his way out and gone exploring in her room . Last night he had made it downstairs , discovering in the moonsoakeddarkness undreamed-of continents , forests of furniture legs , vast rugs heaving with oceanic odors ; toward morning an innocent giant in a nightgown had admitted a lion with a mildewedeye . The hamster had never been given cause for fear and must have felt none until claws sprang from a sudden heaven fragrant with the just-discovered odors of cat and cow and dew . Angela came downstairs in her blue bathrobe , and Piet could not convey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dim-witted little exploration that had ended with such a thunderWelcometo Tarbox , 77clap of death . The kitchen linoleum , the color of grass , felt slick beneath him . The day dawning outside looked stale and fruitless and chill , one more of the many with which New England cheats spring . Angela 's concern , after a glance at him and Ruth and the body of the hamster , was for Nancy ; she carried her from the living room into the relative brightness of the kitchen . SqueamishlyPiet enfolded the russet corpse , disturbingly dense and , the reins of blood slackened , unstable , in a newspaper . Nancy asked to see it . Piet glanced at Angela for permission and unfolded the newspaper . KENNEDY PRAISES STEEL RESTRAINT . Nancy stared and slowlyasked , " Wo n't he wake up ? " Ruth said , her voice forced through tears , " No stupid he will not wake up because he is dead and dead things do not wake up ever ever ever . " " When will he go to Heaven ? " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I do n't know . Maybe he 's up there already , going round and round in a wheel . " He imitated the squeaking ; Ruth laughed , and it had been her he had meant to amuse . Nancy 's anxious curiosity searched out something he had buried in himself and he disliked the child for seeking it . Angela , holding her , seemed part of this same attempt , to uncover and unman him , to expose the shameful secret , the childish belief , from which he drew his manhood . He asked Nancy roughly , " Did you see it happen ? " Angela said , " Do n't , Piet . She does n't want to think about it . " But she did ; Nancy said , staring at the empty floor where it had happened , " Kitty and Hamster played and Hamster wanted to quit and Kitty would n't let him . " " Did you know the hamster was downstairs when you let Kitty in ? " Nancy 's thumb went back into her mouth . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let me see him once more , " Ruth said , and in disclosing to her the compact body like a stiffening heart Piet saw for himself how the pet had possessed the protruding squarish bottom of the male of its species , a hopeful sexual vanity whose final denial seemed to78 COUPLESPiet a kind of relief . With Ruth he knew now the strange inner drying , a soft scorching , that follows the worst , when it has undeniably come true . She went off to school , walked down the crunching driveway in her yellow Easter coat to await the yellow school bus , with all her tears behind her , under a cloudy sky that promised no rain . Piet had promised her a new hamster and a better cage . He buried the old hamster in the edge of the woods , near a scattering of scilla , little lilies of a wideawake blue , where the earth was soft and peaty . One shovelful did for the grave ; two made it deep . The trees were beginning to leaf and the undergrowth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with winter-bleached dead stalks delicate as straws , as bird bones . In a motion of the air , the passionless air which passively flows downhill , spring 's terror washed over him . He felt the slow thronging of growth as a tangled hurrying toward death . Timid green tips shaped like tiny weaponry thrust against nothing . His father 's green fond touch . The ungrateful earth , receptive . The hamster in an hour of coolinghad lost weight and shape to the elements . All that had articulated him into a presence worth mourning , the humanoid feet and the groping trembling nose whose curiosity , when Ruth set him out on her blanket , made her whole bed lightly vibrate , had sunk downward toward a vast absence . The body slid nose down into the shoveled hole . Piet covered him with guilty quickness . In the nearly five years they had lived here a small cemetery had accumulated along this edge of woods : injured birds they had vainly nursed , dime-store turtles that had softened and whitened and died , a kitten slammed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belly by some inconclusive predator who had left a spark of life to flicker all one long June afternoon . Last autumn , when the robins were migrating , Nancy had found one with a broken back by the barn , groveling on the asphalt basketball court in its desire to fly , to join the others . Lifted sheerly by the beating of its heart , it propelled itself to the middle of the lawn , where the four Hanemas gathered in expectation of seeing it take wing , healed . But the bird was unhinged , as Piet 's own father with his shattered chest and spine would have been unhinged hadWelcome to Tarbox , 79his lungs let him live ; and the children , bored by the bird 's poor attempt to become a miracle , wandered away . So only Piet , standing helpless as if beside a party guest who refuses to leave , witnessed the final effort , an asymmetric splaying of the dusty wings and a heave that drove the robin 's beak straight down into the sweetish weedy shadowy grass . The bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as small as a star , and relaxed . Only Piet had heard this utterance . Only Piet , as now , attended the burial . Angela came across the lawn to him where he stood with the shovel . She was dressed in an English-appearing suit of saltand-peppertweed ; today , Tuesday , was her day to he a teaching parent at Nancy 's nursery school . " How unfortunate , " she said , " that of all of us it had to be Nancy who saw it happen . Now she wants me to take her to Heaven so she can see for herself that there 's room for her , and a little wheel . I really do wonder , Piet , if religion does n't complicate things worse than they 'd have to be . She can see that I do n't believe it myself . " He stooped beside the shovel and assumed the manner of an old yeoman . " Ah , " he said , " thet 's all verra well for a fine leddy like yerself , ma'am , but us peasants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the rheumatism , and th ' evil eye . " " I detest imitations , whether you do them , or Georgene Thorne . And I detest being put in the position of trying to sell Heaven to my children . " " But Angel , the rest of us think of you as never having left Heaven . " " Stop trying to get at me and sympathize with the child . She thinks of death all the time . She does n't understand why she has only two grandparents instead of four like the other children . " " You speak as if you had married a man with only one leg . " " I 'm just stating , not complaining . Unlike you , I do n't blame you for that accident . " " Ah , thank ye kindly , ma'am , and I 'll be makin ' a better hamstercage today , and get the poor kid a new hamster . " " It 's not Ruth , " Angela said , " I 'm worried about . " These were the lines drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's innocence ; Piet loved more the brave corruption of the8o COUPLES older , who sang in the choir and who had brusquely pushed across the sill of fear where Nancy stood wide-eyed . Angela and Nancy went off to nursery school together . Piet drove the pick-up truck into downtown Tarbox and at Spiros Bros . Builders &; Lumber Supply bought five yards of galvanized cage mesh , a three-by-four-piece of % " plywood , twenty feet of 2 " pine quality knotless stock , a half pound of i %Z " finishing nails , and the same quantity of the finer gauge of poultry staples . Jerry Spiros , the younger of the two brothers , told Piet about his chest , which since Christmas had harbored a congestion that ten days in Jamaica did not clear up . " Those fucking blacks 'd steal , " Jerry said , " the watch right off your wrist , " and coughed pro- longedly . " Sounds like you 've been sniffing glue , " Piet told him , and charged the hamster-cage materials to the Gallagher &; Hanema account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and slammed shut the tailgate that said WASH ME , and drove to Indian Hill , taking the long way around . He swung by his office to see if Gallagher 's gray Mercedes was there . Their office was a shacklike wing , one-story , upon an asphalt-shingled tenement , mostly un- occupied , on I-lope Street , a little spur off Charity , a short cut to the railroad depot . Charity , the main business street , met Divinity at right angles , and Divinity carried up the hill , past Cogswell 's Drug Store . The church bulked white on the green . Huge airy thing . Twenty-four panes in each half window , forty-eight in all , often while Pedrick wrestled he counted them , no symbolism since when it was built there were n't that many states in the Union , Arizona , Oklahoma , Indian Territory . The lumber those people had . To burn . Waste ? Gives the town a sense of itself . Dismal enough otherwise . On this heavy loveless day everything looked to need a coat of paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red for ages . The green was hourglass-shaped , cut in two by a footpath , the church 's section pinched off from the part holding the backstop and basepaths . Swinging left along the green 's waist , Piet looked toward the Constantines ' side yard hoping to see Carol hanging out wash with upstretched arms and flattened breasts . At Greek dances , leading the line , hair in spit curls , slippered toe pointed out , the neighbors ' boy linked to her by a handkerchief , lithe . Lower classes have that litheness . Generations of hunger . Give me your poor . Marcia brittle , Janet fat . Angela drifty and that Whitman gawky , a subtle stiffness , resisting something , air . Eddie'sVespa but no Ford , Carol 's car . He home and she shopping . Buying back liniment . I ache afterwards . Funeral home driveway held a Cadillac hearse and a preschool child playing with pebbles . Growing up in odor of embalming oil instead of flowers , corpses in the refrigerator , a greenhouse better , learn to love beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hamster . Shattered glass . He eased up on the accelerator . Forsythia like a dancing yellow fog was out in backyards and along fences and hedges and garages , the same yellow , continuous , dancing yard to yard , trespassing . Forgive us . Piet drove on down Prudence Street past the Guerins ' . Nicely restored , six thou , one of their first jobs in Tarbox , Gallagher not so greedy then , Adams and Comeau did all the finish work , nobody under sixty knows how to hang a door . The whole frame had sagged . Dry rot . The uphill house sill buried in damp earth . They had threaded a reinforcing rod eighteen feet long through the summerbeam up through a closet to an ironshod A-brace in the attic . Solid but still a touch off true . Why do n't you want to fuck me ? Good question . Loyalty to Georgene , offshoot loyalty , last year 's shoot this year 's limb , mistress becomes a wife . Sets . Determined set of Georgene 's chin . Not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tarpaper grits , Freddy 's spies . Piet 's thoughts shied from a green plastic spoon . Downhill a mailman gently sloped away from the pull of his bag . Blue uniform , regular hours , walk miles , muscles firm , live forever . At the corner two dogs were saying hello . Hello . 011eh . He drove along Musquenomenee Street , along the river , tidal up to the factory waterfall , low at this moment , black salt mud gleaming in wide scummy puddled flats , the origin of life . Across the river were high-crowned streets of elms and homes with oval windows and leaded fanlights built in the tinkling decades of ice wagons . Knickers , mustaches , celluloid collars : nostalgic for82 COUPLES Welcome to Tarbox 83when he had never been . Piet saw no one . No one walked now . The silver maples were budding in reddish florets but the elms in tan tassels . Rips in a lilac sky . Nature , this sad grinding fine , seed and weed . His spirits slightly lifted as he passed the Protestant cemetery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slate stones adorned with winged skulls and circular lichen . Order reigned . Soon cemeteries and golf courses the last greenswards . Thronging hungry hoardes , grain to India . On the golf course he spotted two lonely twosomes . Too early , mud , heavy lies , spikes chew up the green , proprietors greedy for fees , praise restraint , earth itself hungry , he had thrown it a sop . Pet . Pit . He drove through pastel new developments , raw lawns and patchwork facades , and up a muddy set of ruts beside which hydrants and sewer ports were already installed , in obedience to town ordinances , to his site on Indian Hill . The bulldozer had arrived . This should have pleased him but the machine , a Case Construction King with hydraulic back hoe and front loader , crushed him with its angry weight , its alarming expense . Twenty-five dollars to move it in , twenty-two fifty per hour with the driver , a large coveralled Negro from Mather . Sitting on his jarring throne , he conveyed the impression that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gears ceased to mesh he would himself swing down and barehanded tear the stumps from the outraged red earth . By no extension of his imaginationcould Piet believe that he had helped cause this man and machine to be roaring and churning and chuffing and throttling here , where birds and children used to hide . Yet the Negro hailed him , and his young foreman Leon Jazinski eagerly loped toward him across the gouged mud , and the work was going smoothly . Stumps whose roots were clotted with drying mud and boulders blind for aeons had been heaped into a towering ossuary that must be trucked away . Now the Negro was descending , foot by foot , into the first cellar hole , diagrammed with string and red-tipped stakes . This house would have the best view , overlooking the fan-shaped cemetery toward the town with its pricking steeple and flashing cock . The other two would face more southerly , towardLacetown , an indeterminate area of gravel pits and back lots and uneconomic woods strangely intense in color , purple infused with copper ; and should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first house , the house where he stood , pine siding stained redwood and floor plan C , seeded terrace lawn linked by five fieldstone steps to the hardtopped driveway of the under-kitchen garage , smart flagstonestoop and three-chime front doorbell , baseboard oil-fired forced-hot-water heating and brick patio in the rear for summer dining and possible sunbathing , aluminum combination all-weather sash and rheostated ceiling fixtures set flush , efficient kitchen in Pearl Mist and Thermopane picture window , as bringing $19,900 , or at a knockdown eighteen five if Gallagher panicked , a profit above wages paid even to himself , one-fifty weekly , of three or four , depending on how smoothly he dovetailed the subcontractors , which suddenly did n't seem enough , enough to placate Gallagher , enough to justify this raging and rending close at his back , this rape of a haven precious to ornamental shy creatures who needed no house . Builders burying the world God made . The two-headed tractor , the color of a school bus , trampled , grappled , growled , ramped . Blue belches of smoke flew upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his undershirt , a cannibal king on a dragon dripping oil , grinned and shouted to Piet his pleasure that he had not encountered ledge . " This is the soft side of the hill , " Piet shouted , and was not heard . He felt between himself and the colored man a continental gulf , the chasm between a jungle asking no pity and a pampered rectilinear land coaxed from the sea . The Negro was at home here , in this tumult of hoisted rocks , bucking reversals of directionand shifting gears , clangor and fumes , internal combustion , the land of the free . He was Ham and would inherit . Piet tried to picture the young couple who would live in this visualized home and he did not love them . None of his friends would live in such a home . He stooped and picked a bone from its outline in the earth , where the grid of the dozer 's tread had pressed it , and showed it curiously to Jazinski . " Cow bone , " Leon said . " Does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Do n't they say there was an Indian burying ground somewhereon this south side ? " Jazinski shrugged . " Beats me . " Leon was a weedy , hollowchestedyoung man originally from Nashua , New Hampshire . He was one of the three men that Gallagher &; Hanema kept on the payroll all year long . The other two were venerable carpenters , Adams and Comeau , that Piet had inherited from Ed Byrd , an excessively amiable Tarbox contractor who had declared bankruptcyin x957 . Piet had himself singled out Jazinski from a dozensummer laborers two summers ago . Leon had a good eye and a fair head , an eye for the solid angle and the overlooked bind and a sense for the rhythmic mix of bluff and guess whereby a small operator spaces men and equipment and rentals and promisesto minimize time , which is money . Gallagher , who discreetly craved the shoddy  --  vinyl siding versus wood , pressed wallboard panels versus plaster  --  had intended to lay Jazinski off last winter ; Piet had begged him to hold the boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that something of himself , his younger self , would be lost if they failed to nurture a little longer Leon 's uneducated instinct for the solid , the tight , the necessary . Piet felt that the bone in his hand was human . He asked Leon , " Have you seen any arrowheads turn up ? Beads , bits of pot ? " Leon shook his slow slender head . " Just crap , " he said . " Mother Earth . " Embarrassed , Piet said , " Well , keep your eyes open . We may be on sacred ground . " He let the bone , too small to have been a thigh , perhaps part of an arm , drop . On Leon 's face , downcast beneath a blond eave of hair , Piet spied the smudge of a sneer . In his tone that meant business , the warmth withdrawn , Piet asked , " When can we pour ? Early next week ? " " Depends . " The boy was sulking . " I 'm here all by myself , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " " They 're not to be hurried . " " Waterproofing the foundation takes at least a day . " " It has to be done . " " If it was n't , who 'd be the wiser ? " Welcome to Tarbox : 85Piet said swiftly , seeing he must pounce now , or the boy would be a cheat forever , " We would . And in a few years when the house settled and the basement leaked everybody would . Let me tell you about houses . Everything outs . Every cheat . Every short cut . I want the foundation damp-proofed , I want polyethylene under the slab , I want lots of gravel under the drain tile as well as over it , I want you to wrap felt around the joints or they 'll sure as hell clog . Do n't think because you cover something up it is n't there . People have a nose for the rotten and if you 're a builder the smell clings . Now let 's look at the drawings together . " Leon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hole growing in the earth and said , " Those old clunkers have been a month on a garage me and two kids could have put up in a week . " Piet 's pedagogic spurt was spent . He said wearily , " They 're winding up , I 'll go over and see if they ca n't be up here by tomorrow . I 'll call for a load of gravel this afternoon and see if we can set up Ready-Mix over in North Mather for next Monday , do the three at once , that 'll give you a day each , I 'll help myself if we ca n't squeeze some trade-school kids out of Gallagher . " For an hour , using as a table a boulder under the low boughs of a great oak that would overshadow the patio , he and Leon analyzed the blueprints bought by mail from an architectural factory in Chicago . Piet felt the younger mind picking for holes in his , testing , resenting . It grew upon him as they plotted their campaign together that Leon disliked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a waster , a drinker , an immigrant clown in the town 's party crowd , unfaithful to his wife , bored by his business . This appraisal blew coolly on Piet 's face as he traced lines and dimensions with his broad thumbnail and penciled in adjustments demanded by this sloping site . Leon nodded , learning , yet did not let up this cool pressure , which seemed part of the truth of these woods , where the young must prey upon the not-so-young , the ambitious upon the preoccupied . Piet was impatient to leave the site . In parting , he turned for a moment to the Negro , who had retired with a lunch box and thermos bottle to the edge of the86 : COUPLESexcavation . The sliced sides showed a veined logic of stratification . Pages of an unread book . Impacted vegetable lives . Piet asked him , " Do you ever find Indian graves ? " " You see bones . " " What do you do when you see them ? " " Man , I keep movin ' . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugged by something human arrived from a great distance , imagining behind the casually spoken words a philosophy , a night life . But the Negro 's lips went aloof , as if to say that laughter would no longer serve as a sop to his race . His shoulder-balls bigger than soccer balls . His upper lip jeweled with sweat . A faint tarry tigerishsmell . Piet , downwind , bowed . Pardon me , Dr. King . Piet left the two men in the clearing and drove into town , to the far end of Temperance Avenue , where Adams and Comeau were building a garage at the rear of a house lot . Comeau was thin and Adams was fat , but after years of association they moved as matched planets , even at opposite corners of the garage revolving , backs turned , with an unspoken gravitational awareness of the other . Passing to the toolbox , on a board between sawhorses , they crossed paths but did not bump . Neither acknowledged Piet . He stood in the empty rectangle that awaited a track-hung spring-lift garage door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of space secured . Except for the door , the structure seemed complete . Piet cleared his throat and asked , " When do you gentlemen think we can call it quits here ? " Adams said , " When it 's done . " " And when might that be ? I do n't see a day 's work here , just the door to come . " " Odds and ends , " Comeau told him . He was applying a plane to the inside of the window sash , though the sash was factory-made . Adams was screwing in L-shaped shelf brackets between two studs . Adams smoked a pipe and wore bibbed overalls with as many pockets as a hardware store has drawers ; Comeau 's blue shirts were always freshly laundered and cigarettes had stained his fingers orange . He added , " Once we finish up , the widow 'll haveWelcome to Tarbox : 87to manage herself . " The property belonged to a young woman whose husband , a soldier , had been killed  --  knifed  --  by the Germanboy friend of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left neat , " Adams said . Piet , inspecting , paused at a detail of the framing . A twoby-four diagonal brace intersected a vertical stud and , though the angle was not an easy one , and this was rough work , the stud had been fitted as precisely as a piece of veneer . Waste . Piet felt as if he had been handed a flower ; but had to say , " Leon needs you on the hill to knock together the basement forms . " " Jack be nimble , " old Comeau said , shaking out a match . It was their nickname for Jazinski . " Door is n't come up yet from Mather , " Adams said . Piet said , " I 'll call them . If it is n't brought this afternoon , come up to the hill tomorrow morning anyway . This is a beautifulgarage for the widow , but at six-fifty an hour enough is enough . She 'll have boy friends who can put up shelves for her . I must get back to the hill . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heard Comeau , who was still planing at the window , say , " Greedy Gally 's on his back . " Piet drove home . The square yard and house were welcoming , empty . He carried the wood and wire he had bought into his basement workshop , which he had n't used all winter . He cut some segments of the 2 " pine but discovered that the warpage of the rolled wire was so strong that a cumbersome system of braces would be needed to hold the sides straight . So he formed in his mind another design , using the warp of the wire as a force , and rooted a parabolic curve of mesh on either side of the plywood with the poultry staples , and then cut an oval of wire to seal the cage shut . But one end had to be a door . He improvised hinges from a coat hanger and fitted sticks for the necessary stiffness . As he worked , his hands shook with excitement , the agitation of creation that since childhood had often spoiled his projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final trembling touches . The cage , completed , seemed beautiful to him , a transparent hangar shaped by laws discovered within itself , minimal , invented , 88 : COUPLESPiet 's own . He foresaw Ruth 's pleased surprise , Angela 's grudging admiration , Nancy 's delight and her insistence on crawling inside this child-sized shelter . He carried the cage upstairs to the kitchen and , needing to share his joy of accomplishment , dialed the Thornes ' number . " Is this the Swedish bakery ? " It was their formula , to which she could say No . Georgene laughed . " Hi , Piet . How are you ? " " Miserable . " " Why ? " He told her about the hamster and the dismal work on Indian Hill , but could not specifically locate the cause of his depression , his sense of unconnection among phenomena and of falling . The lack of sun and shadows . Angela 's aloofness . The Negro 's snub . The slowness of spring to come . Georgene said , " Poor Piet . My poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a day for the sunporch , is it ? " " I 've been in the house cleaning . I 'm having the League Board tonight and Irene frightens me , she 's so efficient and worthy . " " Flow 's Freddy 's finger ? " " Oh , fine . He took it out of the spoon yesterday . " " I felt crummy about that . I do n't see why I should want to hurt him since in a way , without knowing it of course , he lets me have you . " " Is that the way you think of it ? I thought I let you have me . " " You do , you do . Thank you . But why do I have such a hatred of him ? " " I have no idea . " Always , over the telephone , there was the strangeness of their not being able to touch , and the revelation that her firm quick voice could be contentious . He asked politely , " Could I  --  would you like me to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we do n't have time to make love . I must get back to the hill . " Her pause , in which they could not touch , was most strange . " Piet , " she said , " I 'd love you to  --  " " But ? " " But I wonder if it 's wise right this noon . I 've had something happen to me . " Welcome to Tarbox , 89Pregnant . By whom ? There was a mirror above the telephone table and in it he saw himself , a pale taut-faced father , the floor tipped under him . She went on , hesitating , she who had confided everything to him , her girlish loves , her first sex with Freddy , when they made love now , her periods , her mild momentary yearnings toward other men , everything , " I think I 've discovered that Freddy is seeing Janet . I found a letter in the pocket of a suit I was taking to the cleaner 's . " " How careless of him . Maybe he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nothing very much . It said , Let 's break it off , no more phone calls , ' et cetera , which might mean anything . It could mean she 's putting on pressure for him to divorce me . " " Why would she want to marry Freddy ? " He realized this was tactless and tried to disguise it with another question . " You 're sure it 's her ? " " Quite . She signed it J and anyway her handwriting is unmistakable , big and fat and spilly . You 've seen it on her Christmas cards . " " Well . But sweet , it 's been in the air for some time , Freddy and Janet . Does it really shock you ? " " I suppose , " Georgene said , " there 's something called female pride . But more than that . I 'm shocked by the idea of divorce . If it comes to that I do n't want him to have anything to throw back at me , for the children to read about in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " " So what does this do to us ? " " I suppose nothing , except that we must be very careful . " " How careful is careful ? " " Piet . I 'm not going to tell you how much you mean to me . I 've said that in ways a woman ca n't fake . I just do n't think I could enjoy you today and I do n't want to waste you . Also it 's too near noon . " " Have you confronted Freddy with your discovery ? " The man in the mirror had begun to squint , as his pang of fear relaxed into cunning. 90 COUPLES I Welcome to Tarbox : 91Georgene , growing franker , said , " I 'm too chicken . He 'll tell Janet , then she 'll know I know , and until I have some plan of action I 'd rather just know . " " I 'm touched by how much Freddy means to you .

I 'm being very stupid and full of threatened egotism . " " I love your egotism . Oh hell . Come on over now if you want , she is n't brought back from nursery school until twelve-thirty . " " No , of course not . I do n't want it unless you feel right about it . You feel guilty . You feel you 've driven poor old God-fearing monogamous Freddy into the arms of this harlot .

' " Smells : the woods , the earth , the Negro 's skin , the planed pine of the garage , the whiskey on Bea Guerin 's breath . " Piet . Am I putting you off ? I do want you . " " I know . Please do n't apologize . You 've been a lovely mistress . " She ignored his tense . " When I found the note , the first thing I wanted to do was call you and  --  what ? Cry on your shoulder .

" Anyway , " he went on , " I do n't think either Freddy or Janet have it in them these days to give themselves much to anybody . " She said , " It 's so sad . You call to be reassured and end up by reassuring me . Oh my Lord . Bernadette 's VW is coming up the drive . Nursery school let out early . Is today a holiday ? " " April twenty-third ? The paper said Shakespeare 's birthday . He 's three hundred and ninety-nine years old . " " Piet . I must run . There 's a lot we have n't said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's , " Piet said , and her kiss ticked as he had halfway returnedhis receiver to the cradle . The man in the mirror was hunched , a shadow ready to spring , sunless daylight filtering into the room behind him . He looked , he thought , young , his crow 's feet and the puckering under his eyes smoothed into shadow . A fragment came to him of the first conversation he and Georgene had had as lovers . She had been so gay , so sporting , taking him upstairs to her bed that fresh September day , he could hardly believe he was her first lover . Reflected autumnal brilliance had invaded her house and infused with warmth her exotic furniture of bamboo and straw rosettes and batik and unbleached sailcloth . Gaudy Guatemalan pillows heaped against the kingsized headboardhad surprised him . Here ? In Freddy 's very bed ? It 's my bed too . Would you rather use the floor ? No , no . It 's luxurious . Whose books are all these ? Freddy 's pornography , it 's disgusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus . But . . . should n't we do something about not making a little baby ? Sveetie . You 're so naieef . You mean Angela does n't take Enovidyet ? You do ? It works ? Of course it works , it 's wonderful . Welcome , Georgene said , to the post-pill paradise . Piet remembered , standing alone in his low-ceilinged living92 COUPLESroom , where the wallpaper mourned its slanting visitor the sun and the spare neat furniture reflected his and Angela 's curiously similar austerity of taste , how Georgene 's cheeks , freckled from a summer of sunbathing , had dryly creased as she made this joke . Her manner had been a feathery teasing minimizing his heart 's clangor , and always until now she had brought to their affair , like a dowry of virginal lace , this lightness , this guiltlessness . If she was now sullied and spoiled because of Freddy 's dabbling , where would he find supplied such absolution ? That first time , had she bathed ? No , it became her habit when he revealed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy calm gaiety been a manner she had contrived to suit some other crimp in his manner of bestowinglove , perhaps an untoward seriousness that threatened her marriage ? His praise had amused her ; she had always respondedthat all women liked to make love , that all women were beautiful , like a toilet bowl , when you needed one . But by daylighthe had discovered on her rapt Roman face an expression , of peace deeper than an infant 's sleep , that the darkness of night had never disclosed on the face of his wife . Furtive husbandly visitant , he had never known Angela as he had often known his lovely easy matter-of-fact morning lay . The line of her narrow high-bridged nose a double arabesque . Her white hairs belying her body 's youth . Her bony bit of a tail . Her receding hollowed the dull noon . Tipped shoots searched for wider light through sunless gray air . The salami he made lunch from was minced death . He went at last to his office . His telephone voice grew husky , defeated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mather and were being ordered from Akron . The price of gravel had gone up two dollars a ton and a truckload could not be delivered before Friday . The urban renewal in Boston had sucked the area dry of carpenters and six phone calls turned up only two apprentices from a trade school twenty miles away . Spring building had begun and he had been slow . Gallagher 's silences , though his conversation was commiserating , breathed accusation . Piet had met Matt in the army , in Okinawa , in 1951 . There , then , in that riverless flatland of barracks and sand , of beer in blank cans and listless Luchuan prostitutes , where the danger ofWelcome to Tarbox  --  93death in battle was as unreal as the homeland whose commercial music twanged in the canteens , Piet was attracted by Matt 's choir-boy prankishness , his grooming , his black hair and eyes , his freedom from the weary vocabulary of dirt and disdain , his confident ability to sell . He had sold Piet on himself as a short cut to architecture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into this life . Piet 's loyalty was lately strained . He found Matt grown brittle , prim , quick to judge , Jesuitical in finance . He dreamed of corrupting whole hillsides , yet wished to keep himself immaculate . He secured his wife and only child behind a wall of Catholicism . In the little transparent world of couples whose intrigueshad permeated and transformed Piet , Matt stood out as opaquely moral . When the phone on his desk rang , Piet feared it would be Georgene , seeking a reconciliation . He hated paining Matt with his duplicity ; he thought of Matt with the same pain as he thought of his father , that ghost patiently circling in the luminous greenhouse gloom , silently expecting Piet to do right , to carry on . It was not Georgene but Angela . Nancy at nursery school had burst out crying because of the hamster . The child suddenly saw with visionary certainty that its death had been her fault .

In hopes of distracting Nancy with syrup and ice cream , Angela had taken her to eat at the Pancake House in North Mather . Now the child , sucking her thumb and running a slight fever , had fallen asleep on the sofa . Piet said , " The kid sure knows how to get herself sympathy . " " But not from her own father , evidently . I did n't call just to touch you with this , though as a matter of fact I do think you handled it stupidly . Stupidly or cruelly . I called to ask you to meet Ruth after school and drive to the pet shop in Lacetown for a new hamster . I think we should do it instantly . " Magic . The new hamster by sleight of hand would become the old one , the one moldering nose-down underneath the scilla . A religion of genteel pretense . The idea of a hamster persists , eternal .

He was heavily conscious of Gallagher listening . Softer-voiced , he added , " I wasted half the morning making a new cage . Did you notice it in the kitchen ? " Angela said , " Oh is that what it is ? We did n't know what it was for . Why is it such a funny shape ? Nancy thought it was a little prison you were going to put her in . " " Tell the kid I love her lots and to shape up . Good-bye . " The books showed less than the twenty per cent Gallagher liked to clear .

He did n't want the job , he did n't like working for social acquaintances . But in his hopeless mood , to escape the phone and the accounts and Gallagher 's binding nearness , he got into the truck whose tailgate said WASH ME and drove down . The marshes opened up on his right , grand in the dying day . A strip of enameled blue along the horizon of the sea . Colored tiles along a bathtub . The first drops of a half-hearted rain , cold and dry , struck the backs of his hands as he climbed from the truck . The lilacs by the door of the Robinson place were further along that those of Piet 's own roadside hedge . More sun by the sea . More life . Tiny wine-colored cones that in weeks would be lavender panicles of bloom . Drenched . Dew . Salt . Breeze . Buttery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence where they enjoyed reflected warmth . Piet lifted the aluminum latch , salt-corroded , and went in . Even under close clouds , the view was prodigal , a heart-hollowing carpeted span limited by the purity of dunes and ocean . He had been wrong , overcautious . It should be Angela 's . Ken Whitman 's field of special competence , after his early interest in echinoid metabolism , was photosynthesis ; his doctoral thesis had concerned the 7-carbon sugar sedoheptulose , which occupies a momentary place within the immense chain of reactionswhereby the five-sixths of the triosephosphate pool that does not form starch is returned to ribulose-5-phosphate . The process was elegant , and few men under forty were more at home than Ken upon the gigantic ladder , forged by light , that carbon dioxide descends to become carbohydrate . At present he was supervisingtwo graduate students in research concerning the transportof glucose molecules through cell walls . By this point in his career Ken had grown impatient with the molecular politics of sugar and longed to approach the mysterious heart of CO2 fixation  --  **27;10041;TOOLONG of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ultimate chamber , the lone reaction that counterbalances the vast expenditures of respiration , that reversesdecomposition and death , Ken felt himself barred . Biophysicsand electronics were in charge . The grana of stacked quantasomes were structured like the crystal lattices in transistors . Photons excited an electron flow in the cloud of particles present in chlorophyll . Though he had ideas  --  why chlorophyll ? why not any number of equally complex compounds ? was the atom of magnesium the clue ?  --  he would have to put himself to school again and , at thirty-two , felt too old . He was wedded to the unglamorous carbon cycle while younger men were achievingfame and opulent grants in such fair fields as neurobiology , virology , and the wonderful new wilderness of nucleic acids . He had a wife , a coming child , a house in need of extensive repair . He had overreached . Life , whose graceful secrets he would have unlocked , pressed upon him clumsily . As if underwater he moved through the final hour of this heavy gray day . An irreversible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the fantastic glass alphabet of flasks and retorts , the clamps and slides and tubes , the electromagnetic scales sensitive to the hundredth of a milligram , the dead experiments probably duplicated at Berkeley or across the river . Ken worked on the fourth floor of a monumental neo-Greek benefaction , 96 COUPLESsooty without and obsolete within , dated 191 I. The hall window , whose sill held a dreggish Lily cup , overlooked Boston . **25;10070;TOOLONG fed the humped dense center of brick red where the State House dome presided , a gold nucleolus . Dusty excavations ravaged the nearer ground . In the quad directly below , female students in bright spring dresses  --  dyed trace elements  --  slidalong the paths between polygons of chlorophyll . Ken looked with a weariness unconscious of weariness . There had been rain earlier . The same rain now was falling on Tarbox . The day was so dull the window was partly a mirror in which his handsomeness , that strange outrigger to his career , glanced back at him with a cocked eyebrow , a blurred mouth , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for most of his life he had consciously avoided narcissism . As a child he had vowed to becomea saint of science and his smooth face had developed as his enemy . He turned and walked to the other end of the hall ; here , for lack of space , the liquid-scintillation counter , though it had cost the department fifteen thousand , a Packard Tri-Garb , was situated . At the moment it was working , ticking through a chain of isotopically labeled solutions , probably Neusner 's minced mice livers . A thick-necked sandy man over forty , Jewish only in the sleepy lids of his eyes , Neusner comported himself with the confidence of the energetically second-rate . His lectures were full of jokes and his papers were full of wishful reasoning . Yet he was liked , and had established forever the spatial configuration of one enzyme .

A sallow graduate student was tidyingup the deserted labs . A heap of gutted white mice lay like burst grapes on a tray . Pink-eyed cagefuls alertly awaited annihilation . Neusner loved computers and statistical theory and his papers were famous for the sheets of numbers that masked the fantasy of his conclusions .

Neusner , Prichard  --  they were both free in a way Ken was n't . Why ? Everyone sensed it , the something wrong with Ken , so intelligentand handsome and careful and secure  --  the very series expressed it , an unstable compound , unnatural . Prichard , a saint , tried to correct the condition , to give Ken of himself , sawing the air with his papery mottled hands , nodding his unsteady gaunt head , whose flat cheeks seemed rouged , spilling his delicate stammer : The thing of it , the thing of it is , Wh-Whitman , it 's just t-tinkering , you must n't s-s-suppose life , ah , owes us anything , we just g-get what we can out of the b-bitch , eh ?

The old man was unmarried . In his youth there had been a scandal , a wife who had left him ; Ken doubted the story , for how could any woman leave so good a man ? Inspiration came to him : Prichard 's virtues might be a product of being left , a metabolic reduction necessary to growth , a fruitfulfractionation . Inspiration died : he looked within himself and encountered a surface bafflingly smooth . On Prichard 's cluttered desk today 's newspaper declared , ERHARD CERTAIN TO SUCCEEDADENAUER . Morris Stein was waiting for him with a problem , an enzyme98 COUPLESthat could n't be crystallized . Then it was after five .

He thought of photosynthesisand it appeared to him there was a tedious deep flirtatiousnessin nature that withheld her secrets while the church burned astronomers and children died of leukemia .

He asked her , " Are n't you cold ? " " No , I 'm warm . I 'm fat . " He wanted to touch her , for luck , for safety , as when a child in Farmington after a long hide in the weeds shouts Free ! and touches the home maple . Gazing in the dying light across the greening marsh , she had a tree 's packed stillness . Her blond hair and pink skin and brown eyes were all one shade in the darkness of the porch . With a motion almost swift , the light had died . Bending to kiss her , he found her skin strange ; she was shiverWelcometo Tarbox : 99ing . Her arms showed goosebumps . He begged her , " Come in the house . " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? " He thought the expression strange . They had never given much thought to money . Advancement , distinction : these were the real things . As if having overheard his thoughts , she went on , " We all rather live under wraps , do n't we ? We hardly ever really open ourselves to the loveliness around us . Yet there it is , every day , going on and on , whether we look at it or not . Such a splendid waste , is n't it ? " " I 'm going in to make a drink . " She followed him in and told him about her day . She had weeded and raked in the side yard . She had decided she wanted roses , white and red mixed , along the blind southern wall of the servants ' wing .

She was a conservationist and distressed that the winter storms had flatteneda number of dunes . Any town but Tarbox would ages ago have put up fences and brush hedges to hold the sand . She asked Foxy to join the League of Women Voters and drank three cups of coffee . With such a monologuist for a husband , you probably have to develop another erotic outlet , but the trouble with people who have poured themselves into good works is they expect you to do the same , pour away , even if they have husbands as handsome , charming , and attentive as , dear , yourself . . .

And finally she had got up her nerve and called this man Hanema to come look at the house . " When will he come ? " " Oh , he came . " " And what did he say ? " " Oh he said fifteen thousand , more or less . It depends on how much you want to do . He 'd like to see us with a full basement but a crawl space with I think he said plastic film over the earth might do for the kitchen half .

He thought the big issue was the basement . He was rather quaint and cute . He kept talking about babies crawling around on a nice warm floor and glancing at my tummy . " Ken felt a weight descend but persisted . " And the kitchen ? " " He sees about four thousand there . He wants to knock out the pantry partition and have new everything except the sink .

" Foxy stood a moment , her pale mouth shaped as if to hum . " I can manage him . He seemed a little forlorn today . His daughter 's pet hamster was eaten by a neighbor 's cat . " Ken remembered Neusner 's tray of gutted mice and wondered how some men still could permit themselves so much sentiment . " You 're the one , " Ken said , " who 'll have to deal with him . " She again moved with that airy quickness , as if she had considered a possibility and dismissed it . " I do n't think he wants the job . He and your friend are building new houses for the population explosion . " " Gallagher 's not my friend especially . Did Hanema recommend any other contractor ? " " I asked him to . He said there was n't anybody he 'd trust us with offhand . He was very indecisive . He seemed to feel possessiveabout this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You keep saying that . " Her reactions had a quickness , her eyes a hard brightness , that was unusual ; he felt an unseen factor operating , an unaccounted-for chemical . She had disliked Hanema : this guess , flattering to himself , inevitable in the light of himself , disposed him to the man , and he told her , " I think , why not put him to work ? Exert your charm . " She was moving , swiftly , lightly , about the room , taking a kind of inventory perhaps , touching rough surfaces that soon would be smooth , saying goodbye to the ugly mementos , the fan-shaped shell collection , the dried sprigs of beach pea and woolly hudsonia , that had housed her for this while , this pregnant month . She changed the subject . " How was your day ? " He confessed , " I feel bogged down . " She thought , You need another woman . She said , " It 's too much commuting . " " It 's too much mediocre mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into law . That we can do . The old man has two flat feet for a brain , and everybody in Hartford thinks he 's nifty . " She laughed , and he looked up startled ; his vocabulary became boyish when he thought of Hartford , and he was unconscious of it . He went on sadly , " I was thinking about Prichard today and it made me realize I do n't really have it . The flair . It all just looks like a bunch of details to me , which is the way it looks to every boob . " " Prichard 's an old man . You 're young . Old men have nothing serious to think about . " By " serious " she meant the shadow within herself , her child , the dark world of breeding. 102COUPLESWelcome to Tarbox103 " Except death , " Ken said , a touching strange thing for him to say .

Foxy said eagerly , " Oh no , when you 're young you think about that . So when you 're old you have nothing to do but be happy for each new day . " She drifted to where a scantling shelf horizontal between two studs held a single forgotten amber marble , striped with a swirl of honey-white . She held it in her pink oval palm and tried to see into its center and imagined God as a man so old each day makes Him absolutely happy . She wondered why she could not share God with Ken , it was so innocent , like this marble , meek and small but there . She did n't ask him to believe in more than this . But in his presence she became ashamed , felt guilty of duplicity . Ken looked up as if awaking . " Who took the boards off the porch doors ? " " He did . Hanema . " " With his bare hands ?

I was going to say that your view makes me sad , because my wife loved it , and I did n't have the courage to do what your husband has done , take this place on .

Janet had never actually slept with Freddy Thorne , though she and Freddy had held earnest discourse about it , and her affair with Harold littleSmithhad proved to be unexpectedly difficult to untangle and end .

They belonged to that segment of their generation of the upper middle class which mildly rebelled against the confinement and discipline whereby wealth maintained its manners during the upheavals of depression and world war . Raised secure amid these national trials and introduced as adults into an indulgent economy , into a business atmosphere strangely blended of crisp youthful imagery and underlying depersonalization , of successful small-scale gambles carried out against a background of rampant diversification and the ultimate influence of a government whose taxes and commissions and appetite for armaments set limits everywhere , introduced into a nation whose leadership allowed alob COUPLES Applesmiths and Other Games 107toothless moralism to dissemble a certain practiced cunning , into a culture where adolescent passions and homosexual philosophies were not quite yet triumphant , a climate still furtively hedonist , of a country still too overtly threatened from without to be ruthlessly self-abusive , a climate of time between , of standoff and day-by-day , wherein all generalizations , even negative ones , seemed unintelligent  --  to this new world the Applebys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexible and decent . Fenced off from their own parents by nursemaids and tutors and " help , " they would personally rear large intimate families ; they : : hanged diapers with their own hands , did their own housework and home repairs , gardened and shoveled snow with a sense of strengthened health . Chauffered , as children , in black Packards and Chryslers , they drove second-hand cars in an assortment of candy colors . Exiled early to boarding schools , they resolved to use and improve the local public schools . Having suffered under their parents ' rigid marriages and formalized evasions , they sought to substitute an essential fidelity set in a matrix of easy and open companionship among couples . For the forms of the country club they substituted informal membership in a circle of friends and participation in a cycle of parties and games . They put behind them the stratified summer towns of their upbringings , with their restrictive distinctions , their tedious rounds of politeness , and settled the year round in unthought-of places , in pastoral mill towns like Tarbox , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Duty and work yielded as ideals to truth and fun . Virtue was no longer sought in temple or market place but in the home  --  one 's own home , and then the homes of one 's friends . In their first years in Tarbox , the social life of the Smiths and Applebys was passed among older men and women . Neighboring aunts dutifully called and were politely received and , in the end , resolutely snubbed . " How dreary , " Marcia would say , " these horsey people are , " and as she and Janet became intimate they coined a term , the " big H , " to signify all those people , hopefully put behind them and yet so persistently attentive , who did all the right things , a skein of acquaintance and cousinship that extended from Quogue to Bar Harbor . Discovering each other at a horseyparty , in Millbrook or Scituate , that each with a great show of wifely resignation had agreed to attend , Janet and Marcia would , by way of greeting , neigh at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hoofing motion of one foot , was very piquant ; she was slimmer then . In truth , they rarely declined these invitations , though as they failed to return them their number slowly diminished . For among these mocked people , however nasal and wooden-headed , the Applebys and Smiths were given presence on the strength of their names and parents ' names ; it was years before Tarbox provided them with a society as flatteringand nutritious as the scorned " big H. " The Thornes and the Guerins were in Tarbox already , but there was something uncomfortable about both couples , somethingunexplained and embarrassed about the men  --  one a dentist , and the other seemingly not employed at all , though frequently in Boston . Both wives were shy ; Bea did not drink so much then , and would sit quiet and tensely smiling for an entire evening . When Roger glared , she would freeze like a rabbit . Harold called them Barbe bleu et Fatime . They all found Freddy Thorne 's smirking pretensions and coziness ridiculous . In those days he still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combed across a bald spot . Georgene was plainly another well-trained , wellgroomedfilly from the Big H , Philadelphia branch . The couples entertained each other with infrequent stiff dinners , and exchangedmaternity clothes  --  except that Bea was never pregnant . The people who did throw parties were a decade older and seemed rather coarse and blatant  --  Dan Mills , the bronzed , limping , and alcoholic owner of the abortive Tarbox boatyard ; Eddie Warner , the supervisor of a Mather paint plant , a bullet-headed ex-athlete who could still at beery beach picnics float the ball a mile in the g ' ' 11-gray dusk ; Doc Allen ; good old Ed Byrd ; a few male teacher in the Tarbox schools , defensive plodders ; and their wives , twitchy women full of vicarious sex and rock-and-roll lyrics , their children being adolescent . To Janet they seemed desperate people , ignorant and provincial and loud . Their rumoredinfidelities struck her as pathetic ; their evident heavy drinking disgusted her . She herself had just produced a baby , 108 COUPLES Applesmiths and Other Games 109Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The skin of his temples exquisitely pulsed as he sucked her breasts , so that not only the hoarsely joshing voices and unsweet breaths but the imperfect complexions of the " boatyard crowd , " as she and Marcia had christened it , offended her ; lepers should not insist on dancing . The boatyard crowd , a postwar squirearchy of combat veterans , locally employed and uncollegiate , knew that it was patronized by these younger cooler couples and suffered no regrets when they chose to form a separate set and to leave them alone with their liquor and bridge games and noisy reminiscences of Anzio and Guadalcanal . Had they been less uncongenial , Janet would hardly have made social overtures to the Saltzes and the Ongs , who moved to opposite ends of the town in 1957 and who at least were college graduates . John Ong , indeed , was supposedly very brilliant . He worked in Cambridge , mathematically deciphering matter , in a program underwritten by the government . He should have been fascinating but his English was impossible to understand . His wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father an immigrant Portugese . She was exotic and boistrous and warm and exhausting , as if she were trying to supply by herself enough gregariousness for two . The Saltzes were killinglyearnest but Irene could be fun after the third martini , when she did imitations of all the selectmen and town officials her crusading spirit brought her up against . Ben had only one imitation , which he did unconsciously  --  a rabbi , with scruffy beard and bent stoop , hands clasped behind him , and an air of sorrowingendurance . But it was not until , in 1958 , Hanema and Gallagherset up their office on Hope Street that the final ecology of the couples was established . With these two men , the Irishman and Dutchman , shaped together like Don Quixote and Sancho Panza , began the round of sports  --  touch football , skiing , basketball , sailing , tennis , touch football again  --  that gave the couplesan inexhaustible excuse for gathering : a calendrical wheel of unions to anticipate and remember , of excuses for unplanned parties . And the two new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , an absent-minded amiability from which theother women were able to imitate the only tone , casual and amused , that could make bearable such a burden of hospitality and intermingling . In 196o the Constantines moved into their sinister big house on the green ; Carol painted , and Eddie flew . As a couple , they had an appealingly dangerous air . And now , in 1963 , the Whitmans had moved into the old Robinson place . These years had seen the boatyard crowd go from decay to disintegration . Two couples had been divorced , the schoolteachershad failed to get tenure and had quit or been dismissed , poor alcoholic Danny Mills had lost his boatyard to the bank and gone to Florida without his wife , whose hard stringy legs had been so quick to master the newest dance step . The only remaining contact with the boatyard crowd was by phone , when one called to ask one of their teen-age daughters to babysit . Their existence , which might have been forgotten entirely , was memorialized by a strange vestige , irksome to Harold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There had been , in those first Tarbox years , another couple called Smith , a pair of big-headed , ruddy , humorless social pushers who had since moved to Newton but who were , for a year , present at the same parties the smaller Smiths were invited to . So the modifiers had been coined as a conversational convenience and had outlived the need for any distinction , and become part of Harold and Marcia , though by now few of their friends knew who the big-Smiths had been , or could envision their ponderous , flushed , doll-like faces , always eagerly nodding , like floats in a Shriners parade . It was an annual cause for hilarity when , with that inexorable plodding friendliness that had been their method of attack , the Smiths from faraway Newton Centre favored the Thornes , the Guerins , the Applebys , and their name-twins with a hectographed Christmas letter . In the salutation to Harold and Marcia they unfailingly put " little " in quotes  --  to our Tarbox doppelgangers the " little " Smiths . The affair among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Marcia noticing Frank 's hands . In turn the beauty of his hands had emerged from their former pudgy look by way of an ulcer diet brought on by the sharp market slump of April and May of 1962 . This slump , which110 COUPLES more affected Frank 's trusts ( he had just been promoted from junior officer ) than Harold 's brokerage business , and which fur- thermore caught Frank with thousands of his own in electronics and pharmaceuticals , brought the couples closer than usual that spring and summer . It became their custom , Sunday nights , after tennis , to eat together fried clams or lobster fetched in steaming paper bags from a restaurant in North Mather . One night , as they sat on cushions and chairs around the little-Smiths ' tesselated coffee table , Marcia became hypnotized by the shapely force with which Frank 's fingers , their tips greasily gleaming , manipulated onion rings . His diet had shorn a layer of fat from them , so the length of the fingers , with something especially sculptured about the knuckles and nail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquent in every light . Along the fleecy wrists , through the cordlike tributary veins raised on the backs of his hands , down into the tips , a force flowed that could destroy and shape ; pruning roses had given Frank 's hands little cuts that suggested the nicks a clammcr or sculptor bears , and Marcia lifted her eyes to his face and found there , beneath the schoolboy plumpness , the same nicked , used , unconscious look of having done work , of belonging to an onflowing force whose pressure made his cheeks florid and his eyes bloodshot . He was a man . He had a battered look of having been swept forward past obstacles . After this revelation every motion of his altered Marcia 's insides with a slight turning , a purling in the flow within her . She was a woman . She sensed now in him a treasurable dreadfulness ; and , when they rose to leave and Janet , eight months pregnant , lost her balance and took Frank 's quickly offered hand for support , Marcia , witnessing as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , felt outraged : a theft had been brazenly executed before her eyes . Nee Burnham , Marcia was the daughter of a doctor and the granddaughter of a bishop . Her detection of a masculine beauty in Frank Appleby at first took the form of an innocent glad lightness in the company of the other couple and a corresponding dreariness on weekends when they were not scheduled to see them  --  though she usually managed to call Janet and arrange for at least a drink together , or a sail with their boys in the Applebys ' catboat . Her possessive and probing fondness was hardly distinguishablefrom their old friendship , though at dances or at parties where they danced she did feel herself lifted by a willingness to come into Frank 's hands . He had never been a dancer , and Marcia , locked into his bumping shuffle , aware of her toes being stubbed and her cool lotioned hand vanishing in the damp adhesionof his grip and his boozy sighs accumulating on her bare neck like the patch of mist a child will breathe onto a windowpane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constantine waltzing from corner to corner around the shadowy rim of the room whose bright dead center she and Frank statically occupied . Harold was an adroit , even flamboyant , dancer , and sometimes after a long set with Frank she would make him take her and whirl her around the floor to relieve the crick in her neck and the ache , from reaching too high , across her shoulder blades . But there was a solidity in Frank that Harold lacked . Harold had never suffered ; he merely dodged . Harold read Barron 's or Ian Fleming on the commuting train ; Frank read Shakespeare . What Marcia did n't know was that she preceded Shakespeare : for Frank the market slump , the sleepless nights of indigestion , the birth of his second child , and his friend 's wife 's starry glances and strange meltingness were parts of one experience , an overture to middle age , a prelude to mortality , that he answered , in the manner of his father , an ardent amateur Sinologist , by dipping deep into the past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow/And coughing drowns the parson 's saw/And birds sit brooding in the snow . . . Those vanished coughs , melted snow , dead birds seemed sealed in amber , in something finer than amber , because movement could occur within it . I 'll have a starling shall be taught to speak/Nothing but " Mortimer , " and give it him/To keep his anger still in motion : in Frank 's contemplation of such passion , perfectly preserved , forever safe , his stomach forgot itself . He was not a natural reader , could n't focus on two lines of Dante or Milton , disliked plays on the stage and novels , and found this soothing quality , of flux confined with all its colors , only in Shakespeare. 112 COUPLES Applesiniths and Other Games 113 " Everything is in him , " he told Marcia , flirtatiously , for he talked about Shakespeare with no one , especially not Janet , who took his reading as a rebuke of her , for not finishing college , but marrying him instead , " everything we can hope to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Even the comedies ?

" " I feel , " Marcia said , for she was a tight-wound nervous woman who had to have things clear , " you 're trying to tell me we would end badly . " " Us ? You and me ? " So he had n't meant at all to tell her his own marriage was unhappy . But she went on , " If we . . . started anything . " " Should we start something ? I 'll buy that idea . Yes . " His large red head seemed to settle heavier on his shoulders as the notion sank in . " What about Harold and Janet ? Should we consult them first ? Let 's not and say we did .

Matt had got permission to use a neighbor 's court . Harold was inside the house , drinking ; Janet was home nursing the baby . It had been a girl , whom they had named Catharine , after an aunt Frank rememberedas a heap of dusty velvet , knobbed with blood-red garnets . Marcia said to him , but after laughing enjoyably , " You 're shocking , with your doubled responsibilities . " " Double , double , toil and trouble . Janet 's been a bitch for nine months plus .

They talked , touching toes , quickly brushing hands in admonishmentor pity , talked about themselves , about their childhoods spent behind trimmed hedges , about Shakespeare and psychiatry , which Marcia 's lovely father had practiced , about Harold and Janet , who , as they obligingly continued to be deceived , were ever more tenderly considered , so that they became almost sacred in their ignorance , wonderful in their fallibility , so richly forgivenfor their frigidity , demandingness , obtuseness , and vanity that the liaison between their spouses seemed a conspiracy to praise the absent . There was a cottage north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their real lives  --  belonging to one of Frank 's aunts , who hid the key on a little sill behind one of the fieldstone foundation-pillars . To Frank as a child , groping for114 COUPLESthis key cached here had seemed a piratical adventure , the pillagingof a deep grotto powerfully smelling of earth and creosote and rodent dung . Now the key seemed pathetically accessible , and he wondered how many others , strangers to the family , had used these same bare mattresses , had borrowed these same rough army blankets from the cedar chest , and had afterwards carefully tipped their cigarette ashes into the cellophane sealer slipped from the pack . In the kitchen there had been a dead mouse in a trap . Dying , it had flipped , and lay belly up , dirty white , like a discardedswab in a doctor 's office . Frank and Marcia stole some sherry from the cupboard but had not disturbed the mouse . They were not here . The cottage was used only on weekends . From its security amid pines and pin oaks it overlooked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window sashes was more saline and rank thai that of Tarbox Beach , where Janet and the children would be sunning . Marcia had felt to Frank strangely small , more athletic and manageable than Janet , without Janet 's troubled tolling resonance but with a pleasing pointed firmness that reminded him , in his passage into her body , of the little mistresses of the French court , of Japanese prostitutes that Harold had once drunkenly described , of slim smooth boys who had been Rosalind and Kate and Ophelia . There was in Marcia a nervous corruptibility he had never tasted before . Her thin shoulders sparkled in his red arms . Her face , relaxed , seemed , like an open lens , to be full of his face . " I love your hands , " she said . " You 've said that before . " " I loved being in them . They 're huge . " " Only relatively , " he said , and regretted it , for he had brought Harold into bed with them . Knowing this , knowing they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel different than Janet ? " " Yes . " " My breasts are so small . " " You have lovely breasts . Like a Greek statue . Venus always has little breasts . Janet 's  --  Janet 's are full of milk right now . It 's kind of a mess . " Applesmiths and Other Games 115 " What does it taste like ? " " What ? Janet 's milk ? " " You do n't have to tell me . " " No , why not ? Sweet . Too sweet , really . " " You 're such a gentle man , " Marcia said . " I 'm not used to being loved so gently . " Thus she conveyed , weakening them as lovers but strengthening them as confidants , the suggestion to Frank that he had been too gentle , that Harold was rougher , more strenuous and satisfying with , no doubt , a bigger prick . As if hailing a dim stubby figure on a misted shore , Frank mournfully confronted the endomorph in himself . His demanding deep-socketed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their skins touched stickily along her length . The neural glitter of her intelligent face was stilled ; a dangling earring rested diagonally forward from her ear lobe , parallel to the line of her cheekbone ; the severe central parting of her black hair had been carried off by a kind of wind . Was she asleep ? He groped beside the bed , among his underclothes , for his wristwatch . He would soon learn , in undressing , to leave it lying discreetly visible . Its silent gold-rimmed face , a tiny banker 's face , stated that he had already been out to lunch an hour and forty minutes . A sour burning began to revolve in his stomach . Their affair went two months undetected . It is not difficult to deceive the first time , for the deceived possesses no antibodies ; unvaccinated by suspicion , she overlooks latenesses , accepts absurdexcuses , permits the flimsiest patchings to repair great rents in the quotidian . " Where have you been ? " Janet asked Frank one Saturday . " At the dump . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I stopped at the drug store and talked to Buzz Kappiotis about the tax rate and the firemen 's four-per-cent increase . " " I thought Buzz was fishing in Maine . " Their cleaning lady was a neighbor . " I do n't mean Buzz , I mean Iggy Galanis , I must be losing my mind . " " I 'll say . You 're so twitchy in bed you give me insomnia. " 116 COUPLES Applesmiths and Other Games 117 " It 's my blue-eyed baby ulcers . " " I do n't see what you 're so nervous about lately . The market 's happy again , they 've reduced the margin rate . And how did your clothes get so rumpled ? " He looked down at himself and saw a long black hair from Marcia 's head adhering to the fly of his corduroy pants . Glancing there , he felt the little limb behind the cloth as warm and used , softly stinging . Sun had streamed through the dusty windshield glass onto her skin . He pulled the hair off and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair wants to spill , to share its glory with the world . No act is so private it does not seek applause . In public Frank could scarcely contain his proud and protective feeling toward Marcia ; the way at the end of an evening he held her coat for her and slipped it around her was as different from the way he would help Georgene Thorne as receiving the Host is from eating an hors d'oeuvre . All the empty pauses and gropings of this simple social action were luxuriously infused with magic : his fingers in adjusting her collar brushed the nape of her neck ; her hands pressed her own lapels secure if they were his hands clasped upon her breasts ; her eyes rolled Spanishly ; and this innocent pantomimeof robing was drenched in reminiscence of their nakedness . Their minds and mouths were committed to stability and deceptionwhile their bodies were urging eruption , violence , change . At last the little-Smiths , Harold prattling drunkenly , spilled from the lit porch into the night  --  a parting glance from Marcia , dark as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janet asked Frank , " Are you having an affair with Marcia ? " " Now there 's a strange question . " " Never mind the question . What 's the answer ? " " Obviously , no . " " You do n't sound convincing . Convince me . Please convince me . " He shrugged . " I do n't have the time or the stomach for it . She 's not my type . She 's tiny and jittery and has no tits . Lastly , you 're my wife and you 're great . Rare Egyptian ! Royal wench ! The holy priests bless you when you are riggish . Let 's go to bed . " " We have to stack the dishwasher first . Anyway , do n't think you 've sold me . How does she know so much about Shakespeare all of a sudden ? " " I suppose she 's been reading him . " " To please you . To get at me somehow . " " How does that get at you ? " " She knows I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brooks , sermons in stones , and good in everything . " " Ha ha . That busy little bitch , she keeps telling me she has a secret . " " She says this ? " " Her eyes say it . And her bottom . I used to think of her as so stringy and intellectual , but she 's been doing a ton of hipwagglinglately . " " Maybe she 's having an affair with Freddy Thorne . " " Take that expression off your face . " " What expression ? " " That amused look . Take it off ! Take it off , Frank ! I hate it ! " And suddenly she was at him , after him with her fists , her struggling weight ; he squeezed her against him , regretfully consciousthat even now , as her pinned fists flailed his shoulders and her face crumpled into contorted weeping and the sharp smell of perfume was scalded from her , that the expression , of serene superiority , of a beautiful secret continually tasted , was still on his face . Harold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his office one morning . He and Janet rarely talked on the telephone ; it was Marcia and Janet , or Marcia and Frank , who arranged the many things  --  the tennis and sailing , the Friday-night plays and Saturday-night concerts  --  that the two couples had done together this summer . The woman 's voice said , " I 've been in town all morning shopping , the damn stores have nothing , and I 'm hungry and cross and wondered if you 'd like to split a lunch with me . Not fried clams , thank you . " Just in time , he recognized Janet . " Janet , really ? It 's a lovely idea , but this is the day I usually118 COUPLEShave lunch with Frank . Why do n't the three of us have lunch together ? " " That 's not the idea , Harold . Could n't you call Frank and cancel it ? Think of some good excuse . Tell him you have a girl friend . Do n't be afraid of Frank , Harold . " " Who said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know it seems funny and pushy , but I must talk to you , and this was the only way I could think of . I knew Wednesday is your day with Frank and that you would be free otherwise . " Still Harold hesitated . He enjoyed a certain freedom of speech and thought because his life , from childhood up , had been outwardlyorderly and obedient . Life was a kind of marathon you could run as you please as long as you touched all the checkpoints ; his weekly lunch with Frank was one of the checkpoints . They discussed stocks and bonds and hardly ever spoke of their domestic life together in Tarbox . Janet prompted , " You wo n't have to pay for my lunch , just have it with me . " This stung him ; he considered himself something of a dandy , an old-fashioned elegant . Last spring , in St. Louis , he had given a girl two hundred dollars to spend the night with him . He told Janet the Ritz , upstairs , at one o'clock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him not to be afraid of Frank because it was she Harold had always been afraid of . Any vulgarity that could not be paid off and dismissed intimidated him . Meeting the Applebys the first time , he had wondered why Frank had married such a common girl  --  fine in bed , no doubt , but why marry her ? Though she was from a respectable family ( her father owned a pharmaceutical manufacturing firm in Buffalo , and her maiden name was on drugstore shelves across the country ) Janet was one of the few women of Harold 's social acquaintance who could have been , without any change in physicalstyle , a waitress or a girl in a five and ten ( in fact she had worked two summers behind a counter , selling men 's jewelry , at Flint &; Kent ) or a dance-hall hostess . She would some day , some day soon , be fat . Already there was a crease at the front of herApplesmiths and Other Games . 119ankles , and the flesh of her upper arms was loose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold did not find her attractive . He did , and this went with his fright . Her beauty seemed a gift she would abuse , like a boy with a gun , or squander , like a fool with a fortune . She struck him as a bad investor who would buy high and sell after the drop and take everybody she could down with her . So he walked , up Milk , through the thick of Boston 's large codger population , along Tremont , through the Common and the Public Garden , in a pinching mood of caution . The sidewalkwas so hot it stung through the soles of his thin black Italianateshoes ; yet scraps of velour and highlights of satiny white skin skated through his head , and it was somewhat romantic of him not to have taken a cab . Of the four Applesmiths , Harold was sexually the most experienced . He possessed that trivial air , trivial yet assured and complacent , that women feel free to experiment with , and before his marriage he had slept with enough to lose the exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentysix ) there had been business trips , and call girls , generally doughy and sullen , with whiskeyish breaths and terrible voices ; but he had never betrayed Marcia with a social equal . After her second martini , Janet said , " Harold , it 's about Marcia and Frank . " " They seem very amiable lately . " " I should hope so . I know they 're seeing each other . " " You know ? You have evidence ? Evidence ? " " I do n't need evidence , I know . There 's a tone about them . He 's always bringing her up , casually . Did Marcia seem irritable to you tonight ? ' What did you think , dear , of Marcia 's dress ? ' What the fuck do I care about Marcia 's dress ? " " But you have no evidence ? There 's been no confession from Frank ? He has n't asked to leave you ? " " Why should he want to leave me ? He 's happy . He 's milking two cows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gracefully . " " I do n't feel graceful about it . You evidently do . Evidently you 're used to your wife sleeping around . " " I am not . The fact is , I do n't believe this . I think there is an120COUPLESApplesmiths and Other Games121attraction between Frank and Marcia , yes . It 's natural enough , considering how much we see each other . For that matter , there 's an attraction between you and me . Toi et moi . " " This is the first I 've heard of it . " " Oh , come on . You know what you are . You know how you look to men . I 'd love to go to bed with you . " " You do n't put things that gracefully yourself . " " Of course , we wo n't . We 're married now and we 've had our flings , our escapades romantiques . We have others beside ourselves to think about . " " Well it 's the others I 'm trying to talk about , Marcia and Frank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are going to bed . What are you going to do about it , Harold ? " " Bring me some evidence , and I 'll confront her with it . " " What kind of evidence do you expect ? Dirty pictures ? A notarized diaphragm ? " Ringlets of vibration , fine as watch springs , oscillated on the surface of his Gibson as he laughed ; there was an unexpected poetry in the woman , face to face across a table for two , the cloth and the softness of her stirred forward by a passionate worry . Through the windows the trees of the Public Garden were hushed cascades , the great copper beech a glittering fall of lava . Janet said , " All right . How is Marcia in bed for you lately ? Less or more ? " How common , really , this was ; it smacked of midwifery , of witchery , of womanish cures and auguries , of stolen hairpins and menstrual napkins . The waiter , a gray man polished and bent by service like a spoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reine , quiche Lorraine , salad , a light dry Chablis . " You 're putting me on a diet , " she said . He told her , " In answer to your question . I think more . " " See ? She 's aroused . She 's full of it . Screwing . " He laughed ; his Gibson glass was empty and no watchsprings materialized . " Come off it , Janet . You expected me to say less , did n't you ? " " Has it been less ? " " No , I was honest . She 's been quite loving lately . Your thesis isthat women are polygamous ; the more they have the more they want ? " " I do n't know , Harold . I 've never been unfaithful to Frank , is n't that funny ? But I would think , as a woman  --  " As a woman : this plump soft phrase out of her mouth gave him the pleasure he felt when , after a party , drunkenly showering , to hear Marcia feign shock he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that she would feel guilty toward you , and wants to prove to herself that this is n't taking away from her marriage , that she has enough for both ; and that furthermore she wants to tell you about it , this wonderful thing about herself , about the whole business . I know that Frank has out of the blue started doing things that I never taught him . " The thin wedge of a headache entered Harold 's right temple . He reflexively reached for his empty glass , uncertain if Marcia had changed or not , for of those conversations of tranced bodies there is little distinct to recall , only the companionable slow ascent to moon-blanched plateaus where pantomimes of eating and killing and dying are enacted , both sides taking all parts . He found Marcia kittenish , then tigerish , then curiously abstract and cool and mechanical , and finally , afterwards , very grateful and tender and talkative and sticky . Janet smiled , tipping a little from her glass into his . " Poor Harold , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it threatens him . But you know , " she went on , having realized he would be good to experiment with , " I ca n't talk to other women comfortably . I could only have said these things to a man . " She stated this with an air of having produced a touching confession for him , but he found it presumptuous and offensive . He thought women should properly talk with women , and men with men , and that communication between the sexes should be a courtly and dangerous game , with understood rules , mostly financial , and strict time limits . Ninety minutes was usually quite enough , and this lunch lasted longer than that . They agreed to have lunch again , next week , to compare notes . Harold went home to a house more transparent ; its privacy had122 COUPLES Applesmiths and Other Games 123been surrendered . While the Applebys lived in town , on a secludedlane on the far side of the Musquenomenee , in an ample white house of nondescript style whose interior comfort was essentially borrowed or inherited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in every detail , a flat-roofed redwood modernoriented along a little sheltered ridge overlooking the marsh to the south . The foyer was floored in flagstones ; on the right an open stairway went down to a basement level where the three children ( Jonathan , Julia , Henrietta ) slept and the laundry was done and the cars were parked . Above this , on the main level , were the kitchen , the dining room , the master bedroom , a polishedhall where hung reproductions of etchings by Rembrandt , Diirer , Piranesi , and Picasso . To the left of the foyer a dramaticallylong living room opened up , with a shaggy cerulean rug and two facing white sofas and symmetrical hi-fi speakers and a Baldwin grand and at the far end an elevated fireplace with a great copper hood . The house bespoke money in the service of taste . In the summer evenings he would drive back from the stationthrough the livelong light hovering above the tawny marshes , flooded or dry according to the tides , and find his little wife , her black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sofas , which was not precisely white but rather a rough Iranian wool bleached to the pallor of sand mixed with ash . A record , Glenn Gould or Dino Lupati playing Bach or Schumann , would be sending forth clear vines of sound from the invisible root within the hi-fi closet . A pitcher of martinis would have been mixed and held chilled within the refrigerator toward this preciousmoment of his daily homecoming ; the tinge of green in the vermouth was intensified by the leafy green , green upon green , ivy and alder and hemlock and holly , crowding through their walls of sliding plate glass . Outdoors on the sparkling lawn , sparkling in the lowering light as the sun slowly approached the distant radar station  --  exquisite silver disc , always fidgeting  --  Jonathan , in bathing trunks and a candy-striped shirt , would be playing catch with Julia , or some children of neighboring summerpeople , tossing a chewed sponge ball , a little pitted moon , hack and forth through the revolving liquid branches of the lawn sprinkler . Henrietta , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her duckling nightie , bathed , would run toward Harold barefootthrough the cerulean rug to be lifted and hugged and twirled , and Marcia would pour two verdant martinis into glasses that would suddenly sweat , and the ball would fall short and lie crescented by sunlight , soaking , while the children noiselessly argued which would retrieve it and get drenched , and his entire household , even the stray milk butterfly perched on the copper fireplace hood , felt about to spring into bliss , like a tightly wound music box . He detected small change in Marcia . They had met one summeron Long Island and married the next , and things , more or less , had turned out as charmingly as had been predicted . They had both been in their mid-twenties and were considered by their contemporaries a bit intellectual and cool . They discovered each other to be sensual , but allowed this coolness to characterize their marriage . They never quarreled in public , rarely in private ; each expected the other to see clearly into the mechanism of their union and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his occasional call girls as hygienic ; he took them as he took , behind the closed bathroom door , without complaint to Marcia , aspirins to relieve his headaches . He could believe that Marcia might be unfaithful to him , but as some kind of service to himself , to save him trouble , to accommodate him with new subtlety . He had married her after most of her friends had married . He had removed her from that crass monied Middle Atlantic society where she had seemed stilted and fragile . He trusted her to be always his . Smiling , she lifted the martini ; the gin and her earrings trembled . He sipped ; the coolness was delicious . Without looking it , they were slightly older than most of their friends in Tarbox ; Harold was thirty-eight , Marcia was thirty-six . She did seem , lately , more inventive and solicitous . A ramshackleboardwalk , in need of repair every spring , had come with their land , with the old summer cottage they had torn down . It led out to a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at high tide , between banks tall with reeds , in water warmer than the sea off the beach , they and their friends and their friends ' children could swim . At night , now , this summer , when the tide124 COUPLESwas right , and the children were asleep , Marcia had taken to inviting him , Harold alone , for a swim before bed , without bathingsuits . So they would walk down in moonlight through poison ivy and cut-back sumac , treading warily , and out the oftenpatchedboardwalk , its slats of varied wood like the keys of a gigantic piano , and on the splintery soft dock take off their clothes and stand , husband and wife , naked together , gooseflesh rising , for an instant of nerve-gathering before plunging from the expectant summer air into the flat black water alive with reeds . Beside him her flitting breasts , arching arms , upturned face gashed by black licks of her hair bubbled through the blanched foam and slopping clammy slick . The water 's million filaments sucked from his nerve ends the flecks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elements , restored to him his youngest self . Sometimes , at high tide , like a laboring Cyclopean elephant a powerboat would come crowding up the channel with its searchlight and they would squat like aborigines under the dock in the root-riddled mud until the boat passed . And they would dry each other , Harold and Marcia , she toweling even his fumbly dripping genitals , thinking how innocently part of him they seemed , and not a harsh jutting second life parasitic upon him . As she ran ahead up the boardwalk , clutching her clothes to her breasts , her buttocks would be dancy in the steady moon . If in bed they made love , with salty bodies and damp hair , she praised his ardor  --  " so fierce "  --  and expertness  --  " oh , you know me so well "  --  as if a standard of comparison , someone gentle and clumsy , had appeared . And she would blurt " I love you " with a new emphasis , as if the " you " were darkened by the shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch Janet had nothing to offer but complaints about Marcia 's constantly calling up and suggesting they do things together , as couples  --  sail , swim , play tennis , go to meetings . She was even trying to get her interested in the Tarbox Fair Housing Committee , which Irene Saltz and Bernadette Ong were organizing . " I said to her , But there is n't a single Negro in town , ' and she said , That 's the point . We 're culturally deprived , our children do n't know what a Negro looks like , ' and I said , Do n't they watch television ? ' and then I said , getting really mad , ItApplesmiths and Other Games 125seems to me awfully hard on the Negro , to bring him out here just so your children can look at him . Why do n't they instead look at the Ongs on a dark day ? ' I should n't have said that , I think Bernadette 's great ; but there 's something basically snotty about this committee . It 's all because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Janet seemed old to Harold , though she was years younger than he , old and double-chinned and querulous , vexing herself with what he knew to be Marcia 's simple gregariousness , her innocent need to be doing . He changed the subject . " What were you and Piet talking about so earnestly at the Thornes ' party ? " Her valentine mouth , its lipstick flaking , frowned . " He was telling me his wife does n't give him shit . He tells every woman . " " He 's never told Marcia . " " She 's never told you . Piet 's been aching to break out for a long time and I do n't know what 's holding him back . Georgene 's right there waiting . " It was fascinating , seeing his friends through a whole new set of windows . " And Freddy Thorne ? " he asked delicately . He had long wondered if Janet had slept with Freddy . Janet said , " Freddy 's my friend . He understands women . " " And that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to say . We 've never gone to bed , I 'm fond of Freddy , he 's harmless . Why are you men so mean to him ? " " Because you women are so nice to him . " Amused to discover himself jealous , Harold studied his fingers , which he set parallel to the table silver , and asked , " Do you think the Hanemas will get a divorce ? " He liked Angela , one of the few women in town who could speak his language . He loved her upward-searching diffidence , her motherly presiding above their summer-evening gatherings . Everyone rather loved Angela . " Never , " Janet said flatly . " Piet 's too tame . He 's too thick in the conscience . He 'll stick it out with those three , picking up whatever spare ass he can . The bad thing about a cockteaser like Angela is she turns her man loose on the world and lets a lot of other women in for trouble . Piet can be very winning . " " You speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 126 COUPLES " There 've been overtures , nothing drastic . Among his other problems , he 's shy . " " Poor Piet , " Harold said , uncertain why , though Janet nodded in agreement . That weekend , he asked Marcia , after a party , when both were drunk , " Do you love me ? " " I love you , Harold , but please not tonight . We 're both too drunk and sleepy . Let 's have a nap instead sometime tomorrow . " Tomorrow was Sunday . " I did n't mean to make love , I meant , honestly , apres douze annees tres heureuses , are n't you pretty bored with me ? Do n't you ever think of what it would be like with other men ? " " Oh , maybe a little . Not very consciously . " She was wearing a chiffon nightie the color of persimmon , and as she crawled into bed her dark limbs looked monkeyish . Getting into bed demandednimbleness of her because the bed was high ; also it was high and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovemaking . The little-Smiths ' bedroom , as they had designed it , was a shrine , a severe sacred space ; its furniture consisted of little more than two teak bureaus , a reading lamp built into the headboard , a mirror on a closet door , a philodendron , and for a rug the hide of a zebra that Harold 's grandfather had shot on safari with Teddy Roosevelt . When she was settled in , he turned off the light . The darkness was purple , and high in the window the marsh moon amid moving clouds seemed to swing back and forth like the bob of a pendulum . " Tell me , ' he said . " You wo n't hurt my feelings . " " OK . Ask me the men . " " Have you ever wanted to go to bed with Piet Hanema ? " " Not really . He reminds me too much of a fatherly elf . He 's too paternal and sympathetic . Once at the Guerins we were left alone in the room with the bigger fireplace and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to burp me . I think Piet likes bigger women . Georgene and Bea and I are too small for him . " " Freddy Thorne . " " Never , never . He 's so slippery and womanish , I think sex is all talk with him anyway . Janet responds to him better than I do ; ask her . " A pp : lesmiths and Other Games 12 " You know I ca n't talk to Janet . Her vocabulary puts me off . " " It 's getting worse lately , is n't it ? " " And Frank ? " Patterns of light  --  long lozenges of moonlight laid across the zebra rug and a corner of the bed ; a rod of electric light coming from the hallway through the crack their door was left ajar , to comfort the children ; a dim bluish smear on the ceiling from a carbon streetlight on the beach road , entering by the foyer transom  --  welledfrom the purple darkness as Harold held his breath , waiting for Marcia 's answer . It came very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Frank 's been a friend too long to think about that way . Besides , he has whiskey breath and an ulcer . No , thanks . " When , still studying their placid guests of light , he made no reply , she stirred and asked , " Why ? Do you want Janet ? " He laughed quite loudly and said , " Mon Dieu , no ! That girl 's pure trouble . " " She 's very hostile to me lately . " " I think , " Harold said , snaking his arm around her and snugglinghis genitals into the curved warmth of her backside , " we should make an effort to see less of the Applebys . Let 's have the Guerins over sometime . Maybe with some new people like the Constantines . The wife seems pretty hip . " Marcia made no response , and he nudged her , and she said , " The Guerins are so depressing . " Janet was gayer at their next lunch , and looked five years younger . The day was one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman summer seems a lover leaving , to be embraced with full abandon : appearances are past mattering ; love disdains nothing . Sweat mars her makeup and mats her hairdo . Her arms swim freely in air . The steaming city streets crammed with secretaries have the voluptuousness of a seraglio . Janet wore an armless cotton dress printed with upside-down herons on a turquoise ground and swung herself along as if nothing in the natural world , no thrust of sun or thunderclap , could do her harm . Her feet , naked in sandals , were dusty , and Harold wondered , walking along Federal Street beside her in the heat , what it would be like to suck each dirty one of her ten toes clean . He128 COUPLES , Applesmiths and Other Games 129took off his coat and swung it over his shoulder like a tough ; they ate in a cafeteria whose glass doors were open at either end like sluice gates . Noise poured through him , backfiring trucks and the clatter of cutlery and the shouting of orders and the words of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and eroded lipstick . She said , " How was your weekend ? " " Fine . You should know . We saw you every minute of it , except when somebody had to go to the bathroom . " " I know , is n't it boring ? Frank and Marcia mooning at each other and exchanging ever so teeny-tiny little tender glances . " " You do exaggerate that . " " Balls , Harold . Frank absolutely gets choleric when he ca n't have Marcia as his tennis partner . And when they 're across the net from each other , all those cute little pat shots , I could puke . He 's always swinging by . ' I 'll swing by the Smith 's to pick up Frankie . " I just swung by Smitty 's to drop off the variorum Shakespeare , and they had me in for a drink . ' It turns out they ' was Marcia and you were off at a town Republican meeting . Harold , why are you a conservative ?  --  it 's such a pose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a massage or a shower . " But you still have nothing definite . " " How definite must definite be ? Harold , he knows too much . He knew you were going to Symphony with the Gallaghers Saturday night . He knew Julia sprained her shoulder diving off the dock Thursday . When I talk to Marcia and tell him what she said he does n't bother to listen because he 's heard it all already . He knows you and she go skinny-dipping down by your dock and then fuck . " " Does n't everybody know that ? The dock part of it . The other does n't invariably follow . " " How would everybody know ? You think your friends have nothing better to do than splosh around the marshes with binocu-lars ? " " Marcia might tell Bea , or Georgene , or even Irene , in pass-ing . " " Well she does n't tell me and I 'm her best friend supposedly . Frank tells me . Frank .

What 's this new gimmick of making things look like comic strips ? " She put her hand palm up on the tabletop ; it was moist , a creased pink saucer of moisture on the silver-flecked formica . When he put his hand in hers , the gesture , amid the clatter and breeze of the cafeteria , felt hugely inflated : two immense white hands , like the mock-up of a beefburger , advertising love . With the other hand she was mopping up bits of pastrami with the final bite of the roll . " That 's a delectable idea , " he said , " but I ca n't . We 're taking off Friday for Maine over Labor Day , so I have only one day left at the office . I need this afternoon . It 's called Pop Art . It 's also called hard-edge . " " So you 'll be gone all weekend ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one by one , on a paper napkin . Her face seemed forlorn ; her eye shadow had run , making her look theatricallytired . Harold said , " Yes , and we 're staying a few days past the holiday , so I 'll miss next week 's lunch with you . le regrette. " ' 130COUPLESApplesmiths and Other Gamesiii " Do you ? " In parting she told him , this blowzy stacked woman in upside-down herons , with a wave of her shapely swimmer 's arm , " Have a good time with Marcia , " the emphasis insolent . Then they went out of opposite ends of the cafeteria , she toward her maroon car in the Underground Garage , he toward his office on Post Office Square , glad to be released . The family place in Maine overlooked a mottled blue harbor choked with glinting sails , swinging buoys , and surprising rocks that all jutted from the water at the same angle , testifying to a geological upheaval aeons ago . The largest rocks supported grass and shrubs and were therefore islands . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless dunes of Tarbox , were niggardly arcs of shingle and brownish grit strewn with rack . Yet Harold , who visited Tarbox Beach only once or twice a summer , here swam before every breakfast . He was always happy in Maine . He ate the lobster and potato salad his mother set before him and read brittle paperback mysteries and old explorer 's accountsin splotched bindings and sailed through the slapping spray and needled his sisters and brothers-in-law and slept soundly , having made love to Marcia like a sailor in from months at sea . She seemed his whore . She crouched and whimpered above him , her nipples teasing his lips . She went down on him purring ; she was a minx . This was new , this quality of prostitution , of her frankly servicing him , and taking her own pleasure as a subdivisionof his . Her slick firm body was shameless yet did not reveal , as her more virginal intercourse once had done , the inner petals drenched in helpless nectar . She remained slightly tight and dry . He did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived , since he found it an improvement : less tact was demanded of him , and less self-control . Perhaps he abused her , for in the second half of their vacation , abruptly beginning on Labor Day night , she refused him . Afterwards she told Frank that suddenly she could n't stand the confident touch of Harold 's alltoo-knowinghands . " He seemed a lewd little stranger who acted as if he had bought me . " To have him inside her was distasteful : " like food in my mouth I could n't swallow . " Perhaps , in Maine , Marcia had experimented with corruption too successfully . Carryingwithin her like a contraceptive loop her knowledge of her lover , she had inflicted a stark sensuality upon her husband and then been dismayed by his eager submission to it . She realized she could serve several men in one bed , many men in one night  --  that this possibility was part of her nature ; and she fled into an exclusive love for Frank . Making love to Harold suddenly lost seriousness . What they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defecation , and it was not until months later , when his form was charged with the tense threat of his leaving her , that the curse of squeamishness was removed from their physical relations . The little-Smiths returned to Tarbox Thursday night . Harold was conscious of having broken the string of appointments with Janet and doubted , without conscious regret , that there would be any more . Her theory had been wrong and may have never been more than a pretext . Growing up with three sisters had left him with little reverence for female minds . He had seen his sisters turn from comfortably shouting slugging animals into deceptive creaturescondemned to assure their survival without overt aggression ; their sensibilities were necessarily morbid . Janet was at best a pgor reasoner and at worst a paranoid . About to go fat and lose her looks , stuck with a bilious and boring husband , she had turned desperately to a man in no way desperate . Brokers reaped in fair and foul weather , and Marcia had demonstrated a new versatility and violence in her love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office Friday and , when no call came , was annoyed at the extent to which he permitted himself to listen for it . All day , as he rooted through the earthboundstack of waiting mail and obsolete stock fluctuations , a signal from outer space kept tickling his inner ear . He remembered her strange way of wearing cloth , so that it came loose from her body and fluttered in the mind 's eye . Perhaps they would see them this weekend . He hoped she would n't attempt a scene . Her indignation was so  --  fluffy . His secretary asked him why he was smiling . Saturday morning , Marcia drove up to the center of Tarbox to talk to Irene Saltz about the Fair Housing group ; Marcia had agreed to be on the education committee , whose chief accom-132 , COUPLES ' Applesmiths and Other Games . 133plishment so far had been to give the high-school library a subscriptionto Ebony . " It might take hours , you know how she talks . Can you feed yourself and the children if I do n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freezer you can heat up . The directions are on the package . The important thing is to boil it with the cellophane on . " They had been up drinking with the Thornes and the Hanemas the night before , and Harold was content to putter about gingerly , tucking away the props of high summer , folding the collapsedand torn plastic wading pool , coiling hose and detaching the sprinkler . Jonathan rummaged the football from a closet and he and Harold tossed it back and forth until a playmate , pudgy Frankie Appleby , arrived , with his mother . Janet was wearing snug blue denim slacks , an orange-striped boating jersey , and an unbuttoned peach-colored cashmere sweater , hung on her shoulderslike a cape . " Where 's Marcia ? " she asked , when the boys were out of earshot on the lawn . " In town conferring with Irene . Where 's Frank ? " " I Ic told me lie was getting a haircut . But he did n't want to take Franklin because he might go to the drugstore and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equine noise , and stamped her foot . She was caught beneath a bell of radiance ; the mistless sharp light of September was spread around them for miles , to the rim of the marshes , to the bungalow-crowded peninsula of East Mather and the ghostly radar dish , cocked toward the north . Janet was hollow-eyed and pale and ripe with nervous agitation , a soft-skinned ripeness careless of itself . Harold said , " You think he 's lying . " " Of course he 's lying . Must we stand out here ? The sun hurts . " " I thought you were a sun lover . Une amoureuse du soleil . " " Not today . I 'm sick at what I have to do . " " To whom ? " " To youm . " Harold opened for her the door that entered from the lawn the lower level of the house , where the children slept and the laundry was done . The laundry room smelled of cement and soap and , this morning , sourly , of unwashed clothes heaped around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint and grass seed and lime were ranged along the other wall , which reeked of gasoline from the power mower . Amid these fragrances Janet took a stance and said , " While you were away in Maine my car broke down , the transmission , so I had to go shopping in Frank 's Corvair . I like the Lacetown IGA and on the way back that officious old Lacetown cop , the one with the gold teeth , stopped me for gliding through the stop sign , you know , just this side of the lace-making museum . What made me so mad , I was almost in Tarbox , where they never arrest you . Anyway , in looking through the glove compartment for the registration , underneath all the maps , I found this . " She brought from her purse a piece of smudged white paper folded quarto . Harold recognized the indigorim of Marcia 's stationery . The notepaper had been given her as a wedding present , embossed with a monogram of her new initials , by a Southampton aunt , boxes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the essence of everything she had married Harold to escape , and used it so seldom , once the thank-you notes were written , that after twelve years it was not used up . Indeed , he wondered if Janet had not somehow stolen a piece , it was so unlike Marcia to write on it . He reached and Janet held the folded paper back from him . " Are you sure you want to read it ? " " Of course . " " It 's awfully conclusive . " " Damn you , give it to me . " She yielded it , saying , " You 'll hate it . " The handwriting was Marcia 's . Dear Frank , whom 1 want to call dearest but can'tBack from the beach , a quick note , for you to have while I 'm in Maine . 1 drove home from our view of Nahant and took the children to the beach and as 1 lay there the sun baked a smell of you out of my skin and I thought , That 's him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed my eyes and pressed myself up against the sun while Irene and Bernadette chattered on and on and the children called from the ocean  --  there was ex-134 COUPLEStraordinary surf today . I feel today left you sad . I 'm sorry the phone rang  --  like icy water being poured over us  --  and that I teased you to stay longer . I do tease .

Love satisfies not only technically . Think of me in Maine , wishing you beside me and happy even in this wish , my " wanton'sbird . " In love and haste , M.The signature was hers , the angular " M " of three strokes emphaticallyoverstruck ; but the body of the letter was written with a flowing smoothness not quite familiar , as if she had been drunk or tranced  --  it had been years since he had examined her handwriting . He lifted his eyes from the paper , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting to feel . " Well , " he said , " I 've often wondered what women think about while they 're sunbathing . " " Oh I iarold , " she cried , " if you could see your face , " and she was upon him , had rushed into his unprepared embrace so swiftly he had to pull Marcia 's letter free from being crumpled between them . The blue-bordered note fluttered to the cement floor . His senses were forced open , admitting the scouring odors of cement and Tide ; along the far wall the sunburned lawn flooded the window with golden stitchwork , like a Wyeth . Janet 's chest and hips , pillows sodden with grief , pressed him against the enameled edge of the dryer ; he was trapped at the confluence of cold tears and hot breath . He kissed her gaping mouth , the rutted powder of her cheeks , the shying trembling bulges of her shut eyes . Her body his height , they dragged each other down , into a heap of unwashed clothes , fluffy ends of shirtsleeves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dank bone . Sobbing , she pulled up her sweater and orange-striped jersey and , in a moment of angry straining , uncoupled her bra , so her blue-white breasts came tumblingof their own loose weight , too big to hold , tumbled like laundry from the uplifted basket of herself , nipples buttons , veins seaweed green . He went under . Her cold nails contemplated theApplesmiths and Other Games 135tensed sides of his sucking mouth , and sometimes a finger curiouslysearched out his tongue . Harold opened his eyes to see that the great window giving on the lawn was solidly golden ; no child 's watching shadow cleft it ; voices glinted from a safe distance , the dock . His face was half-pillowed in dirty clothes smellingmildly of his family , of Jonathan and Julia and Henrietta and Marcia . He was lying on ghosts that had innocently sweated . Janet 's touch fumbled at his fly and he found the insect teeth of the zipper snug along her side . Tszzzc : he tugged and the small neat startled sound awoke them . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not here . " " One more kiss , " he begged . There was a wetness to her mouth , as her breasts overflowed his hands , whose horizon his tongue wished to swim to . She lifted away . " This is crazy . " She kneeled on the cement and harnessed her bosom in cups of black lace that reminded him of the doilies in his grandmother 's home in Tarrytown . It had been her side of the family that had known Teddy Roosevelt , who had taken Grandpa hunting . " The kids might barge in any second , " Janet said , pulling down her jersey . " Marcia might come back . " " Not if she and Frank are copulating out by the dump . " " You think they 'd do it today ? " " Why not ? " Harold said . " Big reunion , she 's back from Maine with the horned monster . Avec le coucou . They 've set us up for them to be gone for hours . Haircuts . Fair housing . " She adjusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Standing , she brushed the smudges on the knees of her slacks , from having kneeled . He remained sprawled on the laundry , and she studied him as if he were an acquisition that looks different in the home from in the store . She asked , " You really never suspectedher until just now ? " " No . I did n't think she had the guts . When I married her she was a tight little mouse . My little girl is all groomed up . " " You 're not shocked ? " " I am desolated . But let 's talk about you . " She adjusted her clothes with thoughtful firmness . " That was an instinctive thing . Do n't count on me for anything . " " But I do . I adore you . Ta poitrine , elle est magni fique. " 136 COUPLES Applesmiths and Other Games 137As if the compliment had adhered , she removed a piece of lint from her jersey . " They 're pretty saggy now . You should have known me when I was nineteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . " He felt it was correct , in asking her , to stand ; and thus their moment of love was reduced to a flattened heap of laundry . Having surrendered all evidence , he was at her mercy . Janet said , " It 's impossible . The children . " Lamely her hands sketched multiple considerations . " Ca n't we ever get together ? " " What about Marcia and Frank ? " " What about them ? Are they hurting us ? Can we give them , honestly , what they give each other ? " " Harold , I 'm not that cool . I have a very jealous moralistic nature . I want them to be punished . " " We 'll all be punished no matter how it goes . That 's a rule of life , people are punished . They 're punished for being good , they 're punished for being bad .

Let 's get something to tell first . Let 's see each other and see how it goes . Are n't you curious ? You 've made me want you , you know ; it was you who chased me through all those hot Boston streets in your sexy summer dresses . Janet , do n't you want me at all for myself ? Am I only a way of getting back at Frank ? " He glided the back of his hand down the slope of her left breast , then of the right . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the way . Touch her , keep touching her . Her breasts are saggyand want to be touched . Do n't give her time to doubt , she hates what she knows and does n't want the time . Do n't pause . She spoke slowly , testing the roof of her mouth with the tip of her tongue and fingering each button on the way down his shirt . " Frank , " she told him , " is going to New York the first part of next week . " " Quelle coincidence ! Also next week Marcia was talking about going to Symphony Tuesday night and doing Junior League good deeds Wednesday morning and maybe spending the night in town . I think she should be encouraged to , do n't you ? Poor saint , that long hour in and out . " Janet gazed over his shoulder ; her mouth , whose long outturnedupper lip was such a piquant mismatch with her brief plump lower , tightened sadly . " Has it really come to that ? They spend whole nights together ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , Do n't pause . " It 's a luxury , to fall asleep beside the beloved . Un luxe . Do n't begrudge them . " He continued stroking . " You know , " Janet said , " I like Marcia . She 's always cheerful , always has something to say ; she 's often got me out of the dumps . What I think I must mind is not Frank so much  --  we have n't been that great in bed for years , poor guy , let him run  --  as that she would do this to me . " " Did you hear what I said about Tuesday night ? " " I heard . " " Which of us should get the babysitter ? " So that fall Harold and Janet slept together without Frank and Marcia 's knowing . Harold at first found his mistress to be slow ; his climax , unmanageably urged by the visual wealth of her , was always premature . Not until their sixth time together , an hour stolen in the Applebys ' guest room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's father , did Janet come , pulling in her momentous turning Harold virtually loose from his roots , so that he laughed at the end in relief at having survived , having felt himself to be , for a perilous instant , nothing but a single thunderous heartbeat lost in her . He loved looking at her , her nude unity of so many shades of cream and pink and138 , COUPLES , Applesmiths and Other Games . 139lilac , the soles of her feet yellow and her veins seaweed-green and her belly alabaster . He found an unexpected modesty and elusivenessin her , which nourished his affection , for he enjoyed the role of teacher , of connoisseur . It pleased him to sit beside her and study her body until , weary of cringing , she accepted his gaze serenely as an artist 's model . He was instructing her , he felt , in her beauty , which she had grown to disparage , though her bluntness and forwardness had clearly once assumed it , her beauty of fifteen years ago , when she had been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty was what happened between people , was in a sense the trace of what had happened , so he in truth found her , though minutely creased and puckered and sagging , more beautiful than the unused girl whose ruins she thought of herself as inhabiting . Such generosity of perception returned upon himself ; as he lay with Janet , lost in praise , Harold felt as if a glowing tumor of eternal life were consuming the cells of his mortality . The autumn of 1962 , the two couples were ecstatically , scandalouslyclose . Frank and Marcia were delighted to be thrown together so often without seeking it . Janet and Harold in private jolted about the now transparent stratagems of the other two lovers . These jokes began to leak out into their four-sided conversations . To the Sunday-night ritual of fetched-in food had been added weekday parties , drinks prolonged into scrambled dinners , arranged on the pretext of driving the children ( Frankie Jr . and Jonathan detested each other ; Catharine was too much of a baby to respond to Julia 's and Henrietta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's houses . While the women cooked and fussed and preened around them , Frank and Harold with bottomless boozy searchingness would discuss Shakespeare , history , music , the bitchy market , monopolies , the tacit merger of business and government , the ubiquity of the federal government , Kennedy 's fumblings with Cuba and steel , the similarity of JFK 's backgroundto their own , the differences , their pasts , their fathers , their resentment and eventual appreciation and final love of their fathers , their dislike and dread of their mothers , sex , their view of the world as a place where foolish work must be done to supportfleeting pleasures . " Ripeness is all , " Frank would sometimes say when silence would at last unfold its wings above the four spinningheads intoxicated by an intensity of friendship not known since childhood . Or Janet would say , knowing they expected something outrageousfrom her , " I do n't see what 's so very wrong about incest . Why does everybody have a tabu about it ? I often wanted to sleep with my brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . We used to take baths together and I 'd watch him get a hard on . He did something on my belly I thought was urination . Now he runs my father 's antibiotic labs in Buffalo , and we ca n't . " " Sweetheart , " Harold said to her , leaning forward above the round leather coffee table in the Applebys ' lantern-hung living room , " that 's the reason . That 's why it 's so tabu . Because everybodywants to do it . Except me . I had three sisters , and two of them would have stood there criticizing . Trois sceurs est trop beaucoup . " Marcia sat up sharply , sensing a cause , and said , " I was just reading that the Ptolemies , you know , those pharaoh types , marriedbrothers and sisters right and left and there were no pinheads produced . So I think all this fear of inbreeding is Puritanism . " Her earrings scintillated . " Cats do it , " Frank said . " Sibling cats are always fucking . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always sibling ? " " I once talked , " Harold said , determined to quarrel with Marcia , " to a banker who did a lot of financing for the Amish around Lancaster P-A , and he told me they 're tiny . Tres , tres petits . They get smaller every generation . There 's inbreeding for you , Marcia . They 're no bigger than you are . " " She 's a nice size , " Frank said . Marcia said to Janet , " I agree with you . I have a dreamy younger brother , he played the oboe and was a pacifist , and it would be so nice to be married to him and not have to explain all the time why you are the way you are , somebody who knew all the family jokes and would be sensitive to your phases . Not like these two clods . " " Vice versa , " Harold persisted , " do you know why **27;10125;TOOLONG telephone rang , pulling Anna Bryant to her feet . She pushed back her disordered hair , tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stood holding the edge of the table . She was afraid to answer . Could it be Dick ? It had to be , it had to be . She left the warm kitchen and ran through the narrow corridor , past the darkroom and the storeroom , into the little front shop . She caught the receiver on the seventh ring . " Yes ? " she was asking , afraid to say " Dick ? " But it was his voice . She leaned against the counter where the cameras were displayed , staring at the wall with samples of his pictures scattered over it . It was daylight out in the narrow little street , people were up and around . And his voice was telling her that he was tine , that he was drying off at the inn , he 'd be home around midday , he 'd be home , he 'd be home . . . . " See you soon , darling , " his cheerful voice said , and he had hung up before she could ask if everything was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . Ile must have found the chest and hidden it . Or else he would n't have sounded so confident . Perhapsit had been easier than she had thought , after all . Except for that mist . She drew a long ; deep breath . The truth was that she had scarcely hoped to see him alive again . Last night , as she had listened to him over their late supper , watching him eat , unable to swallow a bite from her own plate , she had felt only horror and fear and the cold anguish of her world smashed to pieces again . But(40)he had been right : he could do the job ; and he had done it . She paused before one of the pictures on the wall , touching it lightly with her hand . It was a study of Finstersee , taken from the picnic ground in early July , showing the meadow scattered with flowers and , behind it , the deep green forest and , behind that , the mountainsideof gray barren rock . But it was on the three tilted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their base by wild roses and lupins and long-stemmed daisies , that her eyes rested . As she returned to the kitchen through the long stretch of the old house , she heard her brother 's footsteps clumping around in the spare bedroom overhead . One thing about Johann as a guest  --  he gave good warning that he was about to come downstairs . She moved to the kitchen door that led out into the stone hallway and unlocked it so that Johann could enter , for the dark vaulted hall was both the main entry from the street for all the people who lived in the apartments above and the only means to start climbing to the various landings . It was a complicated business living in the Old Town of Salzburg , but the Bryants had thought themselves lucky to find a flat over the shop and , like everyone else who lived in this section , had grown accustomed to coping with seventeenth-century surroundings . Walls bulged and floors sagged , but everything was kept repaired and painted and people talked of character and charm . Inconvenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more antiseptic suburbs  --  that was Dick 's phrase for the modern houses spreading out over the hills that surroundedSalzburg . Anna , looking around at the disorder of her kitchen , was almost disloyal to Dick . Somehow , the parlor furniture from upstairs had infiltrated down here piece by piece  --  there had never been much of it but it certainly made the large room seem small . Originally , it had n't been a kitchen either . But Dick had decided that it was easier to cook here , when they were working late in the darkroom , and to eat here too . Now  --  just what would you call this room ? she wondered . She smiled , knowing Dick 's reply : the warmest and most comfortable in the whole house . I had better start clearing things , she thought , and stood wondering where she 'd start , and then heard through the half-opened door the quick clatter of Johann 's heavy shoes as he came running down the stone staircase outside. ( 41 ) " Careful ! " she called in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She heard him slip and fall . He was cursing everything in sight as he burst into the kitchen . He calmed down when he saw her . " Bloody hell , " he ended , rubbing his backside .

All I have to do is come to Salzburg for three days and I start sneezing and splitting my  --  " He became aware of the kitchen 's state , of his sister 's appearance . Dirty dishes were uncleared from the table , the sink was littered with pots and pans , the lamps were on and the curtains tightly drawn although it was broad daylight out in the streets . Anna 's hair seemed to be falling in pieces around her thin , pale face . She was wearing the same sweater and skirt he had last seen when she had hl ought him broth and her special brew of herb tea yesterday evening . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was huddled in an old coat of her husband 's which usually hung on the back-door peg . " Have you been down here all night ' ?

" I Lis voice was thick with his cold , his eyes looked more gray than blue , but the flush of fever had gone . " One day in bed is enough for me . " He switched off the light , pulled back the curtains , and stared out at a honeycomb of other people 's houses around their tight little courtyard . " You should stay indoors  --  " " We 'll see , we 'll see , " he said irritably . Ile was hungry , but the kitchen was a mess and his appetite was beginning to leave him . Anna never had been much of a housekeeper , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look aful . Will you go upstairs and make yourself decent , and we 'll get this mess straightened up so that a man can enjoy his breakfast ? " " Yes , " she said , latching the coat back on its peg as she left . She climbed the stairs quickly . I 'll get him fed before I give him the news about Dick 's absence , she was thinking . Dick had said she could tell Johann everything . Everything , that was , except the hidingplace of the chest . Or about its contents . No one was to know that . Not at this time . And I was only told about it in case things(42)went wrong , in case Dick never got back . She had been given full instructions what to do if that happened . But she would n't have to do anything . Dick would be home to take charge as he always did . She washed away the sticky streaks of tears , combed her fair hair into its soft wave , added lipstick to her pale lips for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was going to be more than angry . She went downstairs slowly . He had solved the problem of the dirty dishes by shoving them inside the small sink beside the pots and throwing a drying towel over the heap to get them out of sight . He had ground fresh coffee and was putting the kettle to boil . " That 's more like it , " he told her as he gave her a quick glance . " You 're short of food  --  there are three eggs and not much bread . " " I only want coffee . " She had made a big supper for Dick last night . " But what about Dick 's breakfast ? He 'll need something when he wakes up . " " I 'll get some more food before then . " She began breaking the eggs into a bowl . " He takes it easy , does n't he ? " " In between assignments . The book is all ready now . The photographsare waiting to go to Zurich . He may take them there this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Dick wants to see the publisher himself about some details .

" " It was a very generous advance : a check for three hundred American dollars . " I could live for three months on that , thought Johann . " Any chance your Zurich friend would like a book on mountain climbing ? " He watched the answering smile on his sister 's face . No , she was n't unhappy . So there had n't been a quarrel between her and Dick . Yet why had she sat up all night ? Breakfast first , he thought , and then I 'll find out . He sat down at the table to wait in silence. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided no one disturbed her concentration . It was on the simple side , of course ; Dick 's taste in food was simple .

There had n't been a woman or girl in that part of the city  --  yes , some had been younger than Anna , some five times her age  --  who had n't nightmarememories of that day of liberation . No one spoke of it any more ; it was something dead and buried like the corpses under the burned ruins of the Cathedral . No one spoke of it ; all was silence , all seemed forgotten . Seemed . . .

He turned his head aside and blew his nose violently . " Has Dick any spare handkerchiefs ? This cold is all in my head now , blast it . " " I 'll get them . And his slippers . " " They wo n't fit . " " They are better than shoes that are damp , " she told him severely . " You men ! " Yes , he thought , you men . . . . He had almost finished the small omelette before she came running downstairs . There had been no other sounds from the bedroom overhead except her quick light footsteps . He frowned , pouring himself a mixture of hot milk and coffee , and then , as she placed the handkerchiefs at his elbow and the slippers beside his feet , he asked quite simply , " Where is Dick ? " " Your shoes are really sodden , " she told him , and poured her own cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That must have been quite a shower you were caught in . Where were you anyway ? " " On the Monchsberg . " " With a very pretty girl who is probably dying of pleurisy right now . Oh , really , Johann , could n't you just have taken her to a cafe or the movies ? " ( 44 ) " We were at a cafe and we were at the movies , and then we walked along the heights to see the view . " " At midnight ? " " There was a full moon until the rain came . And stop worrying about Elisabetha . She had my cape . How do you think I got soaked ? " " Elisabetha . No , I do n't need to worry about that one . " " Anna , " he asked quietly , " where is Dick ? Sit down . No ; acrossthe table from me . Have some more coffee . Where is Dick ? " " He went up to Finstersee . " Johann stared at her , put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Johann . It 's all right . He is at Unterwald right now . That was Dick telephoning me . " " From where ? " he asked quickly . There were n't so many telephonesin Unterwald . " From the Gasthof Waldesruh . He was going to have breakfast with Herr Grell and his son Anton . " " 1 thought you told me all the photographs were ready . " " They are . " " Then he did n't go up to Finstersee to take some more shots ? He went up to Finstersee to  --  " He could n't finish . Anger choked him . Then he thought , That 's impossible ; Dick must only have been takinganother look around . He calmed down . " What did he tell you ? " " Everything . " " And what is everything ? " His anger was rising again . Dick would n't have told Anna anything unless he was actually taking action about that damned chest . " Did he really believe that a box was lying on the ledge ? " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it was only an informant 's story  --  years ago  --  and he did n't even believe it then . I know . We laughed about it together when he told me , and that was a long time ago . " " There is a ledge at that part of the lake . " " I know ! I 'm the idiot who found it for him ! " " He told me that , too , " she said gently . Johann had taken a party of amateur climbers up around Finstersee last summer and brought them back close to the shore , just at the point where Dick thought the chest might be hidden . And Johann had started telling the girls in the party that the lake was so deep , so filled with strange(45)currents , that no one would swim there . Anna could imagine the scene well enough : time out for rest , the girls teasing Johann about his wild statements . She could see his handsome tanned face smilingas he weighted the end of his climbing rope and threw it out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And as the girls turned away impressed , he had dropped the rope into the lake in front of his feet . And the weight had touched ground just about four meters down by his calculation . " He told me he asked you to find some way to see if the ledge existed , and you did . And you know , Johann , I do n't think you would have bothered if that informant'sstory had n't been haunting you too . " " Well , after what happened at Toplitz  --  " He did n't end the sentence . She knew about Lake Toplitz , that he could see by her face . But he was willing to bet that she had n't been told about the two bodies there , or how they had died . " When did he leave ? Come on , Anna . Tell me it all . " So she told him . Everything except the hiding place , and about the chest 's contents . That was a promise she had to keep . " He might have taken me along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He needed another man . " If Finstersce contained anything at all , the Nazis would be watching . " You had a cold . You ca n't go diving with a cold . Dick said that could make you pass out and  --  " " He rushed this job . I was laid up , and he seized the chance to ditch me . Does n't he trust me ? " " Of course he does . It 's just that  --  just that  --  " She was in trouble , so she stopped . " It 's just that he wants that chest to go to the bloody British or the damned Americans . " His anger was returning . " He says the only important thing is that the Nazis never find it again , " she flashed back at him . " And you like the British and Americans , so why swear at them ? Besides , he is English , is n't he ? He found it , so it goes to them . Is n't that fair ? " " No ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . " " But we are neutral . We 'd do nothing with it . We 'd lock it up safely and then forget about it . But the Nazis wo n't forget . Nor the Communists . Dick says they 'll infiltrate our  --  " " That 's his excuse . " Johann paused . The contents of the chest must be valuable , then . " Did he tell you what was in it ? " ( 46 ) " He did n't want to talk about that . " Which was true . " You really do n't know ? " With difficulty , she kept her eyes from flinching . " Ile said I did not need to know that , " she said , feeling her throat go dry . But that was true , too . Dick refused at first . And then , when I insisted , he told me . Not so much because I insisted but because he realized he had to  --  in case something went wrong . But it did n't , and now I can forget all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , asking , asking . But Johann was off on his own train of thought . " ' Then he knows ! " Johann said swiftly . He thumped his fist on the table , spillinghis coffee , rose to his feet . " I 'm going to phone . " " Whom ? " He halted . Felix Zauner was the man to deal with this problem : he had been with the Austrian State Tourist Department for a numberof years , and then  --  after the Toplitz incident  --  he had gone into business for himself . He had opened a sports-equipment shop in Salzburg , a very small business which allowed him plenty of free time for his particular hobby of skiing . He had a few branch shops , too , although that was n't known except by the men whom he had staked . Johann was one of them . Felix was the silent partner , with his name not even mentioned , far less over the door . He was equally casual about money matters or a share in the profits . All he needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains , and who wanted no Nazis or any other foreigners complicating Austria 's revival . His friendship with Johann was quite open ; he liked Bryant and had a kind of gallant affection for Anna . But what had stopped Johann short on his way to the telephone was Felix 's words when they had last discussed the possibility of Nazi secrets hidden in lakes other than Toplitz . " Let them rot there , " Felix had said . " That 's what they deserve . Unless , of course , there 's definite evidence that the Nazis are raising them to use again . Then we 'll move . And if anyone else is idiot enough to think he could find these documents  --  these old Hitler boys will get him before he even reaches the spot , and another good man will be dead . Tell your brother-in-law to stop being curious . He is n't serious by any chance , is he ? " And Johann had said no , he did n't think Dick was anything more than curious . Anna was watching him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But we do n't know anyone here to whom we could report all this about Finstersee . And why report Dick ? You would n't do that . He is n't hurting Austria . Please wait until he gets back and talk it over with him . " " Why did n't he tell me about the diving gear ? What kind was it anyway ? " And I told Felix he was only curious . " Do n't shout ! " she pleaded . " I do n't know what kind . It is something he used for underwater pictures this summer . " " Where did he buy it ? " Not in Salzburg , certainly . Word would have drifted around . And there had been no talk of Bryant dabblingin underwater pictures , either . " I think in Zurich . " He 's a closemouthed bastard , thought Johann . He stifled some stronger language , thinking of what he was going to say to Felix , and came back to the table to get another handkerchief . He blew his nose again , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna ! He ca n't have found the chest ! Do n't you see ? He never would be having breakfast at the inn with anything as valuable as that chest lying in his car . Now would he ? " She was silent . I wo n't have to tell Johann any lies after all , she was thinking , and relief spread over her face . " No , " she said , at last . Johann 's resentment faded . She 's as glad as I am , he thought , that Dick failed . Felix was right : some things were better left to rot . " Just as well he did n't find anything . He 'd be in danger , and so would you . It is n't only the Nazis we have to worry about . Did you know that a couple of Russian tourists in Bad Aussee were politely escorted to the frontier ? They were n't what their passports said they were . And then there was that Frenchman pretending to be an Italian schoolteacher on vacation . Iie was wandering around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more documents there . He left along with the Russians . " " Have we salvaged all those documents ? Dick thought not . " " And what gave him that idea ? " She half dried her hands and went over to a drawer in the little writing desk where Dick had filed that newspaper clipping of last week . Someday , she thought , we 'll have a real kitchen and a real living room , both separate , both neat . " Here , " she said , giving it to(48)Johann as she returned to the sink . She glanced at the clock . " Oh , dear ! I ought to have done the shopping first . The soup should be on by now . " Johann watched her with amusement ; you could depend on Anna to plan things the wrong way round . And yet , in the darkroom , her work was excellent . Even Dick , who fussed and fumed about textureand light and shade and flawless prints , admitted she was good . Now she had decided to let the dishes drip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet near the door . liv the time she was ready to go , he had read the clipping . It was date-lined Vienna , and only a few days old . Since the first diving operations in Lake Toplitz during the summer of 1959 , when various chests that had been sunk there by the Nazis in 1945 were recovered , there has been considerable speculationin informed circles concerning the contents of these discoveries . It was officially announced , at the time , that among the items recovered from the lake was a cache of counterfeit English fivepoundbank notes amounting to more than 25,000,000 Austrian schillings in value , as well as plans for U-boat rockets . ( The details were given in the August 11th publication of the German magazine " Der Stern " of 1959 . ) But until today silence has been officially maintained about subsequent discoveries , leading certain interested people to believe that documents might still be hidden in Lake Toplitz . Such ill-founded beliefs can now be laid to rest . According to a reliable source , the documents have been identified as German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of Balkanagents working for the German Reich at that time . A governmentspokesman stated today that all diving operations ceased some years ago when it was officially decided that our Styrian lakes had given up the last of their secrets . Such operations were highly expensive to maintain and , without further results , a waste of time and money . " What got into Dick ? It 's obvious we did fish up the documents , too . " And they were scarcely worth the trouble , thought Johann . Now that hoard of counterfeit bank notes and the submarine rocketshad been something ; but a list of Balkan agents , who probably never survived the war anyway . . . He laughed . " Is it ? " ( 49 ) " Of course it 's obvious ! It says here  --  " " It does n't say anything of the kind . A reliable source , ' it says , and that 's all . What reliable source ? " " But the government spokesman  --  " " Is stating the truth , and just read again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But it says here  --  " Johann insisted . " It does n't . " Anna was impatient . " It is simply trying to give that impression . It 's trying to convince people like your Russian tourists and Frenchman that they are wasting their time . Which means there must be some interest starting up in the lakes again , enough to worry our government and make them want to discourage prowlers . It 's  --  it 's hidden diplomacy . That 's what Dick says . " " That 's what Dick says , " he mimicked , and then laughed . " Yes , " she said , blue eyes large with indignation . " But he does n't think they are going to be discouraged ? " " Some of them wo n't be . They know that the Nazis sunk several chests , and these held more important things than the names of Balkan agents . " " So that 's what triggered him off ! " Johann lit a cigarette and poured the last of the coffee . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , " she flashed back at him , " only a crazy idiot would have given shelter to a fifteen-year-old refugee with a three-months-old baby in her arms . " The door closed behind her , leaving him staring at nothing . The coffee was cold , but he drank it . The cigarette tasted like floor sweepings . It was the first time Anna , in all these years , had even mentioned Vienna to him . Dick had kept his silence , too , except for one brief explanation of why he had brought her to Salzburg . " I took her away from everything that reminded her of what Vienna had suffered . " And it was Dick who had arranged for the adoption of the child . That was part of the therapy . " It was Anna 's only chance . And mine . Rape distorts a girl 's mind , leaves revulsionand fear in place of trust . For months , even when she would share my room willingly , would n't leave , would n't go out into the street unless I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow , only afraid of being abandoned again  --  she would flinch if I ever(S0)touched her hair , tremble against her own will when I put a hand on her cheek . " So , thought Johann bitterly , it was a stranger who found my sister wandering in the ruined streets  --  the family friends she had hoped to find either dead or scattered , new addresses unknown . I was n't any help to her then , when she needed most help . I was n't even there . But what good would a sixteen-year-old kid have been anyway ? He had n't described himself as that , of course , back in those days . He was a veteran , a courier for the underground that the Americans and British had formed in the mountains both south and north of the Italian border ; he was a man , a grown man by his reckoning , a very big man indeed . Had n't he , a city boy born and bred , made his way to the mountains when he was only fourteen ? The Germans were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they had done with Josef , his older brother  --  killed in Poland , which was one way of settling Josef 's savage political arguments with their father . ( Come to think of it , it was his father who had turned Josef into a Nazi before the Germans even arrived . ) And his father was n't going to convert him into being a fellow-Communist  --  Marxist was his way of describing himself ; Father had always liked the intellectual touch  --  and sharing the martyrdom of a Nazi concentration camp . Yet the old man was tough . He had survived . Yes , he had survived to come home after that great night of liberation and find what his comrades had done to his wife and daughter . He solved that problem even more quickly than he usedsolve all the problems of the world : he hanged himself from an exposed and blackened beam in the ruins of his house . As for Mother . . . Johann drew a deep long breath . Yes , that was all his mother had needed to push her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then physically . The day after she died , Anna made her way out of the Russian zone . A fifteen-year-old girl with a three-months-old baby in her hands . On foot . With only the clothes they wore . He had tried to imagine that journey , and could n't . Would n't . That was more honest . The past was past . . . . He was tlinking too much about it , today . Perhaps because Ada had been thinking about it . Had she sat all through last nightiemembering ? He rose abruptly , went through to the shop . Here everything wasneat and businesslike . He admired the display of cameras , the expensivegadgets that tourists liked to drape around their necks , and the photographs on the wall that were Dick 's real interest . Mountains , glaciers , forests and meadowlands , lakes ( yes , Finstersee was there among them ) and alpine villages with their half-timbered houses , wooden walls rising from white plaster , balconies set into alcoves under deep eaves . There was a picture of Unterwald , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . Suddenly , Johann frowned . He hesitated . Then , obeying his instinct , he moved quickly to the telephone . He hoped Felix Zauner would n't still he reading a newspaper over his cup of midmorning coffee at ' 1'omaselli 's . But Felix was in his office above the Getreidegasse . " And where are you sneezing from ? " Felix wanted to know . " I 'm in Salzburg , staying with Anna and Dick . Look , Felix  --  what do you know about the Grells , August and Anton Grell ? They keep the inn at Unterwald . " " Pleasant enough . Efficient . The old boy is pretty conservative , though . I could n't interest him at all in turning his place into a real ski lodge . I have an idea for a ski lift up from the valley , but so far he says it would only ruin Unterwald . " Felix laughed . " It 's the first time I 've ever heard a little more prosperity spread among the villagersbeing called their ruin . " Johann wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold . " Why do you ask ? " " I do n't know , " Johann said slowly . He had n't any real reason , only a small worry that had started out as a simple question . He frowned again at the picture of the Gasthof Waldesruh . " It 's just that Dick went up to Finstersee early this morning  --  " " Oh ? " Felix 's quiet voice was now serious . " And he telephoned Anna from the inn . Ile was having breakfastthere . " " Why not ? " " The inn is closed at the moment . At least , it looked very closed when I was up visiting Unterwald two weeks ago . " " I did n't think you noticed anything when you were with Trudi . " Felix might be making a mild joke about Johann 's girl-in-everyvillage , but his next words went right to the heart of Johann 's question . " So they invited him in for a hot cup of coffee . Why does that puzzle you ? " " He does n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . I was wondering if they were  --  well , perhaps a little curious about his photographing the lake . " Now that lie had said it , it sounded damned silly . " I 'm a little curious about everything , " Felix said with a laugh , " including that cup of coffee . It 's more than I was offered when I visited Unterwald . When do you expect Dick home ? " " He 's on his way now . " Johann turned his head quickly as the shop door opened , but it was Anna coming back with her shopping basket piled high . " He will be here around one o'clock . Anna is just about to start making liver dumplings for the soup . " She laughed as she passed him , hurrying toward the kitchen , already slipping one arm out of her coat . " I 'll bring around my camera after lunch and hear what Dick advises . It 's letting in too much light . I may have to get a new one . See you all then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in bed . " Johann went back to the kitchen and warmed his hands at the stove . " That was Felix . " " What did he want ? " Anna asked absent-mindedly . " He needs a new camera . " " Well that 's nice for us . " In the summer months the shop did a brisk business , for everyone who visited this part of Austria came to Salzburg and everyone visiting Salzburg liked to wander through the narrow streets of this old part of the town . That was one of the reasons Dick had chosen to live here rather than on the outskirts , which would have been cheaper as well as given them a garden and a view of the mountains . If Dick 's book did well , if it led to other books of the same kind , perhaps they could afford both a shop on the central Neugasse and a house on a distant hill . Something like Johann 's , only nearer to Salzburg . " What 's wrong , Johann ? " He was too quiet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at her . He was beginning to regret his call to Zauner . Perhaps he had been too quick . Felix might well be more curious about Dick Bryant than about the Grells . And yet , he thought , there really is no harm that scan come to Dick . Not now . If Dick had actually found anything in(53)Finstersee , had refused to hand it over to the proper authorities , there could have been big trouble . Thank God I wo n't have to feel guilty for that , thought Johann . Being neutral could be a very unpleasantbusiness. ( 54 ) 5It was half past one , and for the last ten minutes Anna had been trying not to look at the clock . Johann was moving around the kitchen in one of his restless attacks . Another day of living in this enclosed space , he thought , and I 'd start pushing the walls out . How could people live in towns or cities ? The more he remembered his own place , not much bigger than this but standing free and alone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became his impulse to gather his few things together , find his jeep in its usual parking place , take the highway home . The shop door opened . It could be Dick , although he usually came in the back way ; it was nearer the square where he left his car , for in this part of the Old Town no automobiles were allowed . Anna was on her feet and running toward the shop before Johann could even turn around . He followed quickly . It was a stranger who had entered the shop , a man with intelligentbrown eyes , dark hair , pleasantly rugged features , and a brisk but polite manner . He was fairly young  --  about thirty-five or less , Johann decided  --  and fairly tall , but not quite Johann 's six feet . He , i , was in good condition , Johann noted too , someone who was n't spreading into his thirties . He was an optimist about weather ; he wore no coat , no hat , just a tweed jacket and dark-gray flannels . He carried a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of film were in one hand . That explained his visit. ( 55 ) He addressed Anna . " Guten Tag , gnadige Frau . Ich mochte  --  " He paused , searching for the next phrase . " I speak English , " Anna said . " I am sorry . The shop is closed for lunch . Until half past two . " He looked at the door behind him which was very much open . " Then I 'm out of luck . " He had a very disarming smile . " I forgot to lock it , " she confessed , softening visibly . She liked his attempt to speak German ; that was politeness , at least . Too many foreigners would not even take the trouble . From his voice , he was American . He would be in a hurry ; they always were . " At the moment , we are very busy . If you want your film developed and printed quickly , you should try I.ieleg . That is on the right bank , the other side of the river . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past two ? " She was almost amused . Any other day she would have laughed . She glanced at the clock . " Actually , " he said in his easy way , slipping the boxes of film into his camera bag as if he were glad to get rid of them , " I came here hoping to speak to Mr. Bryant . My name is Mathison , William Mathison . Are you Mrs. Bryant ? " She nodded . He looked over her head toward the hall door . " Mr. Bryant ? " " No , " said Johann , and studied the American more carefully . " This is my brother , Johann Kronsteiner . My husband is not here at the moment . May I take a message ? " A sad and lovely face , thought Mathison , both old and young . But under the gentle mask of politeness , there was some deep anxietythat was pulling her attention away from this room . This had been the wrong time to come here in every way , he decided ; his luck was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last four days , ever since he had arrived in Zurich from New York . He said , " I 'm stayingovernight at the Salzburger Hof . Perhaps your husband would telephone me there when he returns , and we could arrange to meet ? " He produced a card from his wallet . She looked down at it with a frown . It was her brother who took charge then , padding forward in soft slippers that were too small for him . " William Mathison , " Johann read from the card , " Attorney at Law . " He exchanged a look with his sister , and went on reading the names in the bottom left-hand corner of the small piece of paste-(56)board . " Strong , Muller , Nicolson and Hodge . 61 Wall Street , New York 5 , N.Y .  --  and who are they ? " " My law firm . They represent Newhart and Morris . " " Dick 's publishers , " Anna prompted Johann . " Did they send you here ? " she asked Mathison . " But why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice as easy as possible to calm her new anxiety , " for the last four years , I 've been retained -- - " Hell , he thought as he noticed the baffled faces , let 's cut out the jargon . " Whenever Newhart and Morris have a problem , they call on Inc . And I try to help . " " And what 's the problem here ? " Johann demanded . " It 's simple enough , possibly just a  --  " " It 's simple enough , so you came all the way here from New York ? " Johann 's voice sounded belligerent . Mathison turned to the woman . " It 's only a matter of a letter which I think your husband wrote to Newhart and Morris two weeks ago . " He took a folded sheet of paper out of his wallet and handed it over . " This is your husband 's signature ? " " Of course . Was it wrong of him to write his publishers ? He did wait to hear from New York , " she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be in touch with him now that his book was ready to be published . " Mathison stared at her blankly for a split second . " Then he received the check he mentioned in his letter ? And signed a con-tract ? " " But of course ! " The touch of reprimand faded from her voice and face . " Did n't you know ? " Mathison shook his head . He gestured to the letter in her hand . He said gently , " That 's the first we heard of Richard Bryant . Now please do n't start worrying . We 'll clear this up quite easily . " Like hell we will , he thought , but he spoke reassuringly . " It 's just some kind of bungle in the Zurich office . Or perhaps in New York , " he added to soften a hard look from Johann Kronsteiner . " Something has been misfiled , or gone missing in the mail . That happens now and again . " " Did n't you see the samples of my husband 's work ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to see Mr. Yates . " Johann cut in . " Perhaps Newhart and Morris know nothing about Mr. Yates either . " ( 57 ) Mathison restrained himself and said patiently , " Eric Yates has been their representative in Zurich for the last six years . He usually does send samples of the work of any European author he is recommendingto Newhart and Morris , but in Mr. Bryan '  --  t 's case there has obviously been some oversight . " And what samples were they , what kind of work ? Johann was angry . It was obvious he thought that the stranger 's " problem " was something invented by a hunch of Wall Street lawyersto let some New York publishers escape from their contract . " You ca n't get the check hack anyway . It has been cashed . " " I never suggested that Mr. Bryant should return the check , " Mathison said . acidly Ile noted the relief on both their faces , and pressed on with the first small advantage that had come his way . " All we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount , anything you can remember about it . That would help track it down . So would you tell your husband all that ? He has possibly kept some record  --  " Mathison , talking easily again , preparing to leave , walked over to the wall where the pictures were displayed in order to get a closer view of them . " I 've been admiring these , " he said . " Some beauties here . Did your husband take them ? " They were n't signed , but the studies of various lakes were named in a rough pencilscrawl in Bryant 's writing on the gray mat that framed each one . " What camera did he use ? " " A I lasselhlad . " Her voice sounded strained . Ile turned to look at her , pausing in his slow progress down the line of camera studies . She was trying to appear normal , slightly amused . " Your check helped pay for it . " " Money well spent , " he said , and went on with his inspection . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be part of the hook . It 's a study of Austrian lakes , " she said quickly . Ile swung around again and caught the glance passing between Johann and his sister . What on earth have I wandered into ? Mathisonwondered . Do n't these two innocents know that Newhart and Morris are publishers of books dealing mainly with science ? Books filled with words and authority ? And if they used any photographs or illustrations , these were more likely to deal with the trajectory of rockets , or geological slices of contorted rocks , or the interior of a bathysphere , or the exterior of the moon ? But art books ? No , that(58)was n't in any Newhart and Morris catalogue . And what was worryingthese two at this moment  --  his interest in the pictures ? Yet these were the samples Bryant had offered Yates . Ile turned back to the photographs . " I would pay good money for a copy of this kind of book myself , " he said tactfully . " It should sell very well , 1 'd imagine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example . " He studied the quality of a mass of soft-petaled flowers growingaround three giants of heavily grained rock set in a sea of grass against a background of forest and crag climbing to a gently clouded sky . This picture was n't named . " Oh , I see , " he went on , discovering the explanation for himself , " this is a detail of the end of this lake . " He pointed to a photograph a short distance away , and went over to it . Finstersee , it was called . " A grim name . How do you translate it ? The dark lake , or lake of darkness ? " Ile glanced around at Mrs. Bryant for her answer , but she was standingquite rigid , hands clasped tensely . Her brother 's eyes had narrowed . My tact is n't doing so well today , Mathison thought . So he left the photographs with only a passing look at the last one , Lake Toplitz . " Does n't that one interest you ? " Johann wanted to know . Mathison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type , strictly open-air , lean and powerful , a man of quick reactions . Perhapshis trade or profession needed that kind of reflex , but the challenge in his eyes at this moment was puzzling , disconcerting . " I thought I had wasted enough of your time . Sorry if I 've been a nuisance . Well  --  I 'll be going . " " Without seeing my brother-in-law 's records ? We were talking about them , I believe . " The sarcasm was heavy and did n't altogethersuit Johann . Mathison 's surprise deepened . So that 's the reason for his truculence , he thought : this character thinks I used the check as an excuseto get in here and study these photographs . Then his explanationseemed so wild that Mathison pushed it to the side of his mind . He said quietly , " We were . Is it possible to see them now ? I thought Mr. Bryant might have them locked in his safe . " " We do n't need to lock things up in Salzburg , " Johann said curtly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Finstersee , thank God , but now her eyes were fixed on the clock over the shop door . Damn this American who had talked of time. ( 59 ) " It 's almost two , " Anna was saying . " Oh , Johann  --  it 's almost two . " " Get Dick 's files , that 's a good girl . Go on , Anna . Qet them . " It was better to start searching for them instead of watching a clock and thinking of Dick . Better , too , to call the American 's bluff and show him the record of the check and get rid of him . " It would save me coming back here again and troubling your husband , " Mathison said , and that at least seemed to make good sense , for she nodded and hurried toward the back of the house . The kitchen possibly lay there ; the appetizing smell of soup was growing stronger by the minute . The silence in the shop was complete . Mathison was careful to keep away from the photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow street . It was barely twelve feet wide  --  about the breadth of his living room back in New York  --  and edged by just the suspicion of a sidewalk . Two men were walking there . Slowly . They were dressed definitely for Salzburg , in capes and dark-green felt hats each with a chamois brush sprouting at the rear of its squashed crown . He might have paid them no more attention , transferring his interest to a couple who had the right idea about life  --  a boy and a girl , holding hands , laughing at something preposterous  --  ifone of them had been able to resist staring at the shop door . It was then he remembered seeing them before , at the end of the short street , as he had walked slowly up here from the Altmarkt searching for Bryant 's address . Suddenly , the silence was broken . Anna Bryant 's clear voice , carrying through the tunnel of a hallway , was welcoming someone and then explaining to him about the stranger from America . " Bryant ? " Mathison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head . " Just a friend of the family , " was all he said , but even that was an admission he was relaxing . Ile greeted the man with evident relief . " Felix , come in . Glad you got here . " Mathison thought it wiser not to look too paid at the man whose family privileges included the use of the kitchen dour , so he contented himself with a polite nod as Anna Bryant murmured a quiet introduction to Herr fanner , and then turned away to open the large Manila envelope she had brought him . There was n't much in it , but the contents were neatly arranged and across its flap was(60)written , in Bryant 's handwriting , Yates . He took out the documents , placing them for all to see on top of a counter , and began going through them . " Businesslike , " he said approvingly to Anna Bryant , who stood beside him . " Yes , my husband is a very careful man , " she said with pride . So careful , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sent to Yates and of the one letter to Newhart and Morris  --  there was a photograph of a check for three hundred dollars . A wide and happy grin spread over Mathison 's face . " This is all we need , " he told her . " Do you mind if I photograph it , Mrs. Bryant ? That 's the simplest way to put it into our own records . " He took out a neat camera only two inches long , switched on the lamp on the counter after exchanging its bulb for the high-intensity one that he carried in his bag along with an adapter for foreign sockets , laid the check under the bright beam . " You come prepared , " Johann said , leaving Zauner in his corner . He looked curiously at the check . " It 's made out in New York ! The First Maritime Bank of New York . " He studied the signature . " Emil Burch . Who 's that ? " Mathison did n't answer . He was busy photographing the copies of Bryant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarming Mrs. Bryant , for the flat truth was that Newhart and Morris did not bank with the First Maritime . Neither did they have anyone called Burch who was allowed to sign their checks . And although Johann , breathing down the back of his neck , or the family friend standing silently against a wall might not believe it , the last thing that Mathisonhad come here to do was to add to Anna Bryant 's troubles . " Just one thing : the contract . It is n't in this file . " He switched off the light , and closed his camera , placing it carefully in his carrying bag . " No . Mr. Yates has it . He promised last Wednesday  --  or was it Saturday ?  --  when he phoned . He promised it would be here soon . " Her thoughts wavered . " He is always telephoning , " she said , trying to sound amused . She made an effort to complete her answer . " We  --  that is , my husband  --  signed two copies of the contract . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July . " Mathison helped her . He was beginning to see the pattern . " And after signing , Mr. Bryant sent the two copies back to Yates , who was going to send them to New York for the publisher 's signature. ( 61 ) One copy would stay in New York , the other was going to be returned to Yates to send to you . Was that it ? " She nodded . " And the check was sent to you through Yates ? " " In August , the beginning of August . " She was definite about that . Johann cut in brusquely . " Is n't that the usual way ? I mean about this Yates fellow sending on the contract ? " " It 's the usual way , " Mathison said reassuringly , his eyes on Anna Bryant 's white face . But nothing else about this whole case was in the least usual . There had n't been one mention of Bryant 's name , far less a contract , in the files of Yates 's office in Zurich . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check back into their envelope . Not one real letter from Yates , he observedagain ; just two notes which must have accompanied the check and the contracts , and these were friendly and brief , making no specific mention of any business . One said : Here it is ! Glad it came through so quickly . Good luck with the Hasselblad . I hope it wo n't be long before you can get to Ziirich again . Yours . . . And the other : We kept these as straightforward and simple as possible . Just return them to me with two samples of your fine sloping scrawl and I 'll attend to the usual routine . It may take tune , but I 've had the go-ahead signal from the Great White Father in New York , so all is well . Yours . . . A very skillful job , Mathison thought . His lips tightened . " I 'll straighten all this out in Zurich , " he said . He pocketed the letter which he had brought with him , and reexchangedthe light bulbs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't thank you enough , Mrs. Bryant . You 've been more than helpful . I 'm sorry I had to  --  " " You know , " said Felix Zauner , leaving his quiet corner , " I should have thought that everything might have been straightened out by this time if you had gone to Zurich first . " His voice and manner were nonchalant , his eyes watchful . " I did . " Mathison let that have its effect while he studied Zauner openly for the first time . To the facts he had already noted  --  mediumheight , solid construction , neat tweeds  --  he could add reddish hair thinning and receding , a high forehead , an aquiline nose , prominent cheek bones , gray eyes with fine lines at their corners , lightly tanned skin . Zauner was waiting , his head cocked slightly to(62)one side , eyebrows raised just enough , lips almost pursed . Mathisontook the hint and went on . " Unfortunately , Yates was just leavingas I arrived . He is visiting a couple of scientists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get a book out of each of them . I 'll see him when he gets back on Wednes-day . " " You had no time at all to bring up Bryant 's name ? " " No time at all . " It was better to look inefficient than to blurt out the unpleasant truth : Yates had laughed off Richard Bryant  --  merely an old acquaintance who was always concocting some wild scheme , bit of a joker , did n't do to take him seriously . " But I do n't understand , " Anna Bryant said slowly . " Mr. Yates is in Zurich . He called us from there . " " When ? " " Last Wednesday , then Saturday . And then  --  very early this morning . " " From Zurich ? You are sure ? " " I took the call . He left a message for my husband to telephone him in Zurich . " Her voice trailed as she glanced up at the clock . " Have you got that num  --  " Mathison , watching her face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " he began awkwardly , and then finishedquickly with " Good-bye . And thank you , Mrs. Bryant . " He offered his hand , and she took it , trying to answer his smile . Her fingers were ice-cold . " Sure you have n't forgotten anything ? " Johann called after him . I had better not , thought Mathison as he stepped onto the narrowsidewalk and joined the brisk stream of foot traffic . This was a town of walkers ; they knew how to step out , had little time for dawdling . That was how he came to notice the two men again . They were still in the Neugasse , now at its lower end , preparing to stroll up its short curve once more . Mathison pretended to ignore them , but he was quite aware of their scrutiny as he passed them . Why should they be interested in me ? he wondered . Is Bryant 's shop so closely under observation that anyone who spends any time there is immediately worth noting ? And what makes Bryant so important as all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two men closing a business deal , taking the air , waiting for a friend , discussing a family problem . He stopped to light a cigarette , look at a window displaying wood carvings and chessmen , choose the mo-(63)meat to glance back up the Neugasse . They had n't left it ; they had turned at the top of the street to resume their patrol . Mathison went on his way , following the gentle slope of this maze of sixteenth-century houses and lanes down to the riverbank where he would start dodging cars and buses again . From there , he could n't miss his hotel . He kept thinking about the Neugasse . It was none of his business , he had to remind himself sharply . His first job , right now , was to telephone New York . " What did you make of him ? " Johann asked Felix Zauner as they watched the door close behind the American . " And why did you keep him here , Anna ? " " Keep ? " ? " Answering all those damned questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the American who puzzled her ; it was Eric Yates . A vague fear , undefined and all the more frighteningbecause of that , began to stir at the hack of her mind . " I 'll get you something to eat , " she said in a low voice . " That 's more like it . I 'm starving . Look , Felix , do you think he was an American agent ? You should have seen the way Finstersee drew him . Like a magnet . He  --  " Johann noticed Anna had stopped abruptly at the doorway to the hall and was looking back at him with wide eyes . " He could be one , " he ended lamely . I made a mistake there , he thought ; she knows I must have told Felix about Finstersee . " Quite possibly , " Felix said . " The rumors about Finstersee might well attract dubious types . " He watched Anna 's face . " What rumors ? " She kept the fear out of her eyes . " He was only trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Anna and her instincts , " Johann said jokingly . " She liked him , so she trusted him . " What rumors ? she kept asking herself . There could he no rumors unless Eric Yates had spread them . Or Johann , if he had talked too much to Felix . Or Felix himself ? " My dear Anna , " he was saying , " never trust anyone unless you know he is on your side . " " Sometimes not even then , " she said bitterly . She walked slowly(64)into the long hallway , looking down at the Manila envelope in her hands . " And who was that Parthian shot aimed at ? " Felix asked , keeping his voice amused for Anna 's benefit . " Me , " Johann said glumly . " You were n't supposed to know about Finstersee . Felix , why do n't you tell Anna who you really  --  " " How 's your cold ? " Felix asked quickly . Anna was within earshot . " I have n't had time to think about it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure . " Anna had reached the kitchen . Felix moved swiftly over to the door that separated the shop from the hallway and was usually forgotten , so that it stayed open most of the time . He closed it gently . " I 'm leaving for Unterwald , " he said very quietly . " Are you feeling fit enough to go there , too ? You 'll have to look after Anna ; first  --  get her settled with a neighbor or take her over to my house . She ca n't be left alone here . You see  --  I have bad news . " He paused . But Johann had got his message . " Yes , " Felix added gently , " Bryant is dead . " " How ? Where ? " " His car skidded off the hill road near St. George 's Church . I got word from the Bad Aussee police just before two o'clock . After you telephoned me this morning , I called them to keep an eye open for his Volkswagen and let me know when it passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Was he alive when they found him ? Could he talk ? " " No . His neck was broken . He had been thrown out of the car as it fell down the slope  --  the door had opened , been wrenched off its hinges as the car turned over and over ; it was lying not far from his body . It 's the only thing left of the car . " " It burned ? " " At the bottom of a gully where it landed eventually . They have n't been able to get near it so far . " Johann was scarcely listening . " I do n't believe it , I do n't believe it ! A skid ? Dick was too careful a driver . And he knew that road , he knew  --  " Shock gave way to pain . " Anna  --  how am I to tell Anna ? " Felix Zauner had no answer for that . Each man had to find his(65)own way to tell his bad news . " While you 're with Anna , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was staying ? " The practical voice was like a bucket of water doused over Johann . He stared at Felix . Half-angrily he said , " The Salzburger Hof . And he left a card . Somewhere . " Ile gestured contemptuously at the counter . " Business as usual ? " he asked bitterly , turned on his heel and left . At least , thought Zauner as he moved quickly to the counter and found Mathison 's card , Johann is under control again . Small help he would be to Anna if he started going to pieces right now . Besides , urgency waits for no man . he picked up the telephone and got through to his office . " Dietrich , " he said crisply , " I 'm just about to leave . Any further reports from Unterwald ? God , they are slow ! Here is something else for you to worry about . I want all information on a William Mathison , American , possibly staying at the Salzburger I lof . If he is n't , check all the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace him . Yes , complete ! And find out from Vienna if they 've got information about him . Also , if they would reach New York and verify his firm there , I 'd be grateful . Here 's its name : Strong , Muller , Nicolson and Hodge . ' I'hcy are said to be lawyers . He is also employed by a publishing firm called Newhart and Morris . Got all that ? " He waited while Dietrich repeated the names . Careful man , Dietrich ; sometimes almost too careful , he thought wryly . " One more thing : when you are talking to Vienna , ask them what they know about Eric Yates , a British subject possibly , now living in Zurich . . . . That should hold you until I get back . Tomorrow or the next day , depends on what I find in Unterwald . Unless , of course , you uncover anything that would bring me back here in a hurry . You know where to call me . " So the pebbles were cast and the millpond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ le frowned at the picture of Finstersee as he passed it , his steps slowing to a halt . Whose agent had Bryant been ? Not one of ours , he decided , or else I 'd have been told to contact him when the first rumor about Finstersee began filtering through Intelligence circles last week . Strange how such a rumor could start in the undercover world . It could develop from a hint , one phrase , that some quickwittedlistener picked out of seemingly innocuous conversation ; it(66)could be a word , one name , in an intercepted message . All it needed was the knowledge to understand what the hint or word or name might mean , and you had the beginning of a rumor that no intelligence-gathering agency could afford to leave unchecked . If Bryant had somehow been the source of that current rumor about Finstersee , his death would arouse real interest in it . Unless , of course , his death was an accident . In that case , even the quick wits of Western Intelligence might be inclined to drop Finsterscc into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lack of clear information . Yes . Bryant 's death had to be an accident . As Zauner entered the narrow hall , his pace slowed again . 13ryantan agent ? Right here in Salzburg for all these years ? No , he decided , Bryant might in some way have stumbled upon some information , but that 's about all . He was too cantankerous , too quixoticto take orders from anyone . Not once , in all these years , did he have contact with any known Intelligence agents who had floated in and out of Salzburg . He might have been a sleeper , of course , but surely he would have been activated at the time of the Lake Toplitz incidents . He could have been very useful there if he had been a trained agent . His war experience ? Negligible for what an agent had to face today . And once peace broke out , the British had ditched him quickly enough . No , if Bryant had any information about Finstersee , the most he would do with it was to sell it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Felix  --  " Johann called worriedly , " come in , listen to this ! She is n't going anywhere . She is staying here . That 's what she keeps saying . " He threw up his hands in despair and rose from the table where he had been sitting opposite Anna . " You persuade her , " he said , and went over to stand at the window . Zauner looked at Anna in complete disbelief . Her face was set in a blank white mask , letting neither tear nor cry escape . Her arms were folded tightly around her , her eyes staring into space . " Anna  --  " he began , wondering if she could even hear him . " I 'm not leaving . I stay here . " " That is not wise . Believe me . Please  --  " " I am staying . " Her voice was low but decided . Zauner moved over to Johann . " Get her out of here . And call a(67)doctor . He will give her a sedative and she 'll sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He glanced at his watch and swore . " You 'll make sure she does n't stay here by herself ? " Johann nodded . Zauner hesitated , went back to Anna . " I am so sorry . So terribly sorry . Anna  --  " " Please leave me alone . " Zauner retreated . " You 'll have to persuade her , " he told Johann almost angrily as he opened the back door . " Do a better job with that than you did with breaking the news of Dick 's accident . " " I did n't even have to break the news  --  she seemed to know the minute she saw me . " But the door had closed before the sentence ended . " Accident , " Anna repeated . She shook her head slowly . " We do n't know yet  --  not until we get up to Unterwald . I 'll find the truth for you , Anna . I promise that . " " And promise me  --  " She bit her lip , tried to remember what he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things I told you this morning  --  Johann , you must tell no one about them . No one . " He came over to her , pulled her chair around gently so that he could look closely into her eyes . " Why not , Anna ? " " Dick said no one . I promised him for both of us . " There was no choice . " I give you my word . I wo n't fail you . " He kissed her cheek . " But why did he want no one to  --  " " For safety , " she said quickly . For the safety of a box of papers . She began to weep as her hands went up to cover her face . For her safety , thought Johann . Yes , Dick had been right . Anyonewho knew as much as Anna could he in serious danger if the word got around . He could take care of himself ; but Anna ? " I 'm going to call Frieda Dietrich . She and her husband will look after you until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ile did n't wait for her answer , but hurried away from her tears toward the telephone. ( 68 ) With some calculation of time zones and advice from the hotel porter on placing transatlantic calls , Mathison reached James Newhartby half past ten in the morning , New York time . Or rather , he was stopped by the usual defense perimeter of cool-voiced secretary . " Now , Linda , " he told her , " do n't give me that salesconferenceroutine . Nothing really starts until eleven o'clock at those Monday meetings , and this call is costing him schillings by the second . I 'm in Salzburg . " That sent her off at a run , and Mathisonhad barely time to arrange an armchair and disentangle the long extension cord of the telephone , so that he could sit in front of a picture window with a real view , before Newhart 's voice boomed in his ear . " Easy with that baritone , Jimmy . " " It 's those damned bulldozers outside . " Newhart dropped his voice to normal . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear . " " Why Salzburg ? " " I drew too many blanks in Zurich . " " I called Yates to expect you . Was n't he co-operative ? " " He was just dashing off to Germany . You may get two new authors . " Newhart 's voice lost its edge . " What about his files ? Or his secre-tary ? " " Nothing and nothing . So I decided to try this end of the puzzle. ( 69 ) I think it 's solved , more or less , but it is n't pleasant . The Bryants seem to have been thoroughly taken . " " What ? " " I 'll write out a full report for you , and I 'll add some things I would n't want to discuss over the telephone , but here 's the gist now . Bryant has kept a small file of his dealings with Yates . He also has a photograph of the check he received , through Yates , supposedly from Newhart and Morris . Three hundred dollars ' advance , drawn from  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A book of photographs of Austrian lakes  --  " " Bill , you 're kidding ! " " I wish I were . They arc very good photographs , too , so good they really are worth publishing . That 's the sad thing about it all . " " Bryant has three hundred dollars of our money . " Then a new worry came into Newhart 's voice . " What kind of contract did he have ? " " His copy has n't been returned to him yet . And I do n't know whose three hundred dollars he has . The check was supposed to come from you , but it was signed by Emil Burch . The bank was First Maritime of New York . Forty-third Street branch . " There was a long pause , complete silence . Then Newhart said slowly , " Just a minute and I 'll jot that down . Emil Burch ? " " B as in boy , u as in uncle , r as in robin , ch as in church . But you 'll have a copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can get my film developed and printed . Yes , I did some photographingmyself . " " Then Bryant was co-operative . " Newhart sounded relieved . " He was n't there . Mrs. Bryant was very helpful . " " Did you tell her the whole thing must have been a misunder-standing ? " " No . And you would n't have , either , if you had seen the tension she was under . " " They 've got to he told sometime . " " That 's not my job . " At least , I hope to God it is n't , Mathison thought . " And anyway , should n't we have a talk with Yates first of all ? What do you want me to do ' ? Get back to Ziirich and meet him when he returns on Wednesday morning ? But I 'd really prefer you to send someone from the firm , and I 'll stand at his elbow and be(70)ready with legal advice . You 'll have to do something about Yates , wo n't you ? I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be some mistake ? " " When you see my report along with the evidence , I do n't think you 'll have any doubts . " " But Yates has always been completely reliable , a very good man  --  " " I know , I know . " " Did n't he have anything to say to you ? " " We had only time for a few words . He thought we were taking Bryant too seriously . He says the man is just a psychopathic liar who would n't risk facing any real trouble . " " Yates thinks he could handle him alone ? " " So I gathered . And I admit I was inclined to believe him . But in fact he has n't handled Bryant as yet . Has he ? So I came to Salzburg . And I saw the check . It does exist . Just who is Emil Burch ? " " We are taking action on that right now . Linda is getting the manager of First Maritime on the other wire for me . So we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see Bryant himself when he gets back ? Or do I return to Zurich and start throwing my weight around there ? " " I think Zurich  --  no , perhaps you should see Bryant himself . " There was a pause . " I 'll have to call you later about that , Bill . I have a conference waiting , and I ca n't cut that . Actually , I 've nothing but conferences today , one after the other . Look  --  I 'll call you much later ; make it the end of the day . Around seven ? " " Your time ? " " That 's right . It will be around midnight your way . Okay with you ? " " Well , I 'll have to give up that champagne supper with the polka girls over at Ossi 's Feinschmecker Restaurant , but I 'll be here . " Newhart actually had a laugh coaxed out of him , which , for a Mondaymorning like this one , was no small triumph . " My hotel is the Salzburger Hof . And not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And thanks , Bill . I mean that . " Mathison set down the telephone by his feet , lit a cigarette , and sat studying the view of the Old Town opposite him . Had he been too quick to judge Yates ? Was Richard Bryant quite so much the injured party ? Could he have arranged for Mr. Emil Burch to send(7.1)him that check , faked something that looked like a contract , concoctedYates 's brief notes ? Well , let 's see . . . . Bryant had written a letter to Newhart and Morris two weeks ago . Three days later , it was on James Newhart 's desk . He had tried to straighten the matter out right away , by a telephone call to Eric Yates in Zurich . The call had been taken by Yates 's secretary , Greta Freytag  --  he was away on one of his businesstrips . She had n't known much about Richard Bryant except that he had visited the Zurich office last summer . She was not sure about any contract ; however. , she would search Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , she could only report that she could n't find any file at all She would search further , she promised , and suggested that Mr. Yates would be able to answer all Newhart'squestions when he returned at the end of the week . But Yates had explained nothing , actually . He had been astonishedand politely regretful . Bryant was a very light acquaintance of many years ago , so light indeed that Yates had only remembered him with difficulty when he had dropped in for a social call at the Zurich office last summer . There had been no business talk between them whatsoever , just a general kind of conversation about publishing . Perhaps Bryant had assumed too much , or had jumped to wrong conclusions  --  he might be a psychopathic personality with delusions of authorship ; there were plenty around who 'd take one word of friendly interest as a definite promise to publish . In any case , Yates would telephone Bryant right away and tell him he had better drop his wild story about a contract . A couple of well-chosen phrases would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said when Newhart called him with the full story . " You do n't think Richard Bryant will he so easily scared off ? " " I do n't imagine he would have written to you unless he had something plausible to back up his statements . Ilk letter is very specific , you know . He considers you his publisher , bound by contractand an advance . " " Any use telephoning him ourselves ? " " Not at this stage . He would only repeat what he stated in his letter . We 'd have to see his evidence . What did Yates report back to you , by the way ? " " A complete foul-up . Not Yates 's fault , " Newhart added(72)quickly . " He 's a very competent and capable fellow . You know what he landed for us on that last business trip ? A manuscript from a couple of physicists working in the field of elementary particles . " " But he landed nothing for us in Salzburg ? " " He phoned several times , and only got a polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be out . However , Yates is persevering  --  " " Let 's call Yates now . I 'll be at your elbow . And I have some specific questions to ask him . " Mathison listed them carefully . But they were never answered over the telephone . It was Miss Freytag who took that call . Yates had come down with grippe and was at home nursing a temperature . And when Mathison questioned her about a file on Richard Bryant , she froze completely . There never had been any file , she insisted now . She had been mistaken . " I do n't like it , " Newhart was forced to admit . " It looks as if there has been some kind of office bungle and they are trying to cover up . Why the hell ca n't people just admit they made some small mistake , lost a couple of letters or something ? " " What letters ? " Mathison asked . Poor old Jimmy was flapping around , trying to find some simple explanation to some simple problem . But nothing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looming over the horizon . " You 're right , " Newhart admitted slowly . " We know nothing . We 'd have to talk with Miss Freytag face to face . We 'd have to get Yates to take this really seriously  --  he thinks my worries are exaggerated , that he can handle Bryant with a couple of sentences . And we 'd have to find what possible basis there could be for the story this Bryant fellow has cooked up . Is that what you are thinking ? " And as Mathison nodded , Newhart said gloomily , " A lawsuit could be more trouble and expense than a trip to Zurich . That 's where to begin , obviously . It could all be settled in a couple of days . Bill , you handle this . When can you leave ? " And that was why Mathison had been sent chasing over to Zurich . Last year , it had been to Amsterdam , to settle a threatened suit for a supposedly broken contract , a three-day visit that had stretched into two weeks before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more time spent on money-making schemes than on his own drawing board . Jimmy Newhart was developingquite a sixth sense for picking out a trickster . And Bryant(73)was his present choice for that kind of character . Yet , thought Mathison , it was n't any feeling of guilt about any cooked-up scheme against a New York publisher that had created the scene in Bryant 's shop today . The moment of real tension did not arise when I was looking at his file on Yates . Or even photographing his records . It arose when I looked at the photographs on the wall , and it did n't involre just Mrs. Bryant , whose nerves were on edge long before I arrived . ( Remember the way she came running through from the back of the shop as I stepped in the front door and then stopped as she saw me  --  a stranger about whom she knew nothing  --  and the excitement and welcome on her face drained away into disappointment ? ) I Ier brother became as tense as she was , more so if you add up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the kind whose job must keep him in the open air much of the time , an extrovert with a carefree look and impudent humor once he stopped being suspicious  --  not the type to panic easily . And what was wrong about paying so much interest to a first-rate camera study of the lake with the dark name  --  what was it called ? . . . Finstersee . Ile rose , coiling up the extension cord roughly as he carried the telephone back to the bedside table . Time to get out and take some photographs of his own before the light faded . It was a fine afternoonnow , with clear blue sky and strong sun , but the high wooded ridge that jutted up behind the Old Town was already shadowing the tight-packed roofs that stretched along the bottom of its cliff . Soon the rest of the tall stone houses , made miniature by the medievalspires , renaissance towers , baroque domes that soared above churches and palaces , would be covered by that soft-gray blanket of preniatume dusk . Ile found his camera hags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a scraping of a key in the lock of his door , Possibly a maid with towels , he thought . But it was a man who entered , quickly and silently . lie was dressed in dark-gray overalls and held a telephone in his hand . Ile stopped abruptly as he saw Mathison . " What do you want ? " Mathison asked in German . His two years ' army sers ice in Berlin had left him with an authoritative bark when he needed it . " I am sorry to disturb you , " the man said , hesitating , mustering(74)some composure . " I did not know the gentleman had returned to his room . " You 're half an hour late , thought Mathison . He did n't reply . The onus of proving the innocence of his presence , as his heavily legal friends would say , was certainly not his to bear . He simply stared at the telephone the man was now keeping close to his side , as if it were part of his trouser leg . " Your telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed all right to me . " " I have orders to change it . " The man was thin , young , undersized , and sweating slightly at the temples . Poor guy , thought Mathison , you are doing your job , but I 've a strange suspicion it seems necessary only to you . " Shall I test my phone ? " he asked blandly . " Or could it possibly be a mistake ? Are you sure you have the right room ? This is 405 . " The man seized the excuse with a slightly embarrassed grin . " Then it is a mistake . " He made the pretense of checking in a small notebook . " I 'm looking for 305 . I 'm on the wrong floor . " And with many apologies , the nervous man left as quickly as he had entered . Mathison looked down at the small Minox lying in his camera bag . It looked lonely , he decided . Especially with all those telephonesneeding to be exchanged . After all , the film it contained was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So he thought for a minute and then removed the valuable roll of film , wrapped it carefully in a sheet of soft tissue from the bathroom , dropped it into the breast pocket of his shirt , disliked the small bulge it made and decidedit was too close to warm skin anyway , found a thin Italian matchbox in his raincoat pocket , flushed the delicate little sticks of wax matches down the toilet , and inserted the covered film neatly into their place . The flap-over lid closed and no more . It was secure . He looked around the large bedroom for a hiding place , something so obvious that no one would think it of any importance . Beside the ashtray ? No , it had better be somewhere he could touch it and reassure himself it was safe . He slipped the box into the deep pocket of his tweed jacket , added a half-smoked pack of cigarettes . Not original , he told himself , but you 'll know what is happening to it . Then he filled the Minox with a new roll of film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he dropped the miniaturecamera back into the bag and replaced it on a wardrobe shelf . All that trouble possibly for nothing , but at least  --  as he had photographed the town through the window  --  he had determined where he was heading with his Rolleiflex . Right up there , crowning its own massive hill to the left of the wooded ridge , was the Hohensalzburg , the enormous castle old in story . It was girded with walls and battlements , plenty of space for strolling and climbing around its towers , plenty of light , too , for it overlooked everything from its eyrie . That 's for me , he thought , and grabbed his coat . Outside his hotel , there was a short stretch of busy street before he reached the long low bridge to take him over the strong flow of the river . He did n't notice the man then . But halfway across the bridge , when he almost collided with two women carrying a load of packages and turned to apologize , he saw the stranger who stopped abruptly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mathison paid little attention , thought nothing about it until ten minutes later , when he was striking quite a rapid course through the Old Town 's mixture of narrow streets and broad squares . ( His long search this morning for Neugasse 9 had given him basic training in some necessarygeography . Distances here were actually short ; they only seemed complicated because so much was grouped in so little space . ) He had cut around the Cathedral , walked briskly past the white marble fountain which had been built for watering horses two centuries ago , became aware he was about to take a wrong exit from the square , veered quickly to reach the right one , and saw the man again . Same raincoat , same height and breadth , same fair hair , same man . It might have been coincidence , of course ; Salzburg was the kind of place where you could keep remeeting people . Only , thought Mathison , it was odd that this one was always the same distance behind him . The man was n't lighting a cigarette this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marble horsepond . Mathison increased his pace and in a few minutes reached the cobbled street that backed right up against the steep rise of the castle 's hill . Here he could take the funicular for a quick ride up to the castle itself . And he was in luck ; the cars were now finishing a(76)descent , and he would n't have long to wait until they were hauled uphill again . He bought his ticket and stood in the waiting room with half a dozen varied characters . No sign yet of the man in the raincoat . Then everyone filed out of the waiting room to find places in the nearest car , and Mathison could only wonder if the man was now arriving and buying a ticket . The idea amused him , although he felt annoyance too . Who the hell would want to have me followed ? he wondered ; and then he decided the whole thing was ridiculousand his imagination had been running wild . But the man was doing more than buying a ticket . He was using the few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call over the attendant 's telephone . " I picked him up in the hotel lobby , but I think he has seen me , " he told Dietrich at the other end of the wire . " He is bound to notice me on the funicular . He 's on his way to the castle . So get someone up there as fast as possible to take over . I 'll keep near him to mark him out . In case that 's difficult , here 's the description of what he is now wearing : fawn tweed jacket , two vents in the back , well-cut ; narrow darkgraytrousers ; light-blue shirt , blue tie ; brown shoes ; raincoat at present over his arm ; camera . And he 's  --  sorry ! " The man jammed the phone back in place and made a dash outside to the funicular . It was a quick , steep-angled haul through boulders and small trees , tunneling through the lower wall and the first huge bastion ; Once on foot , Mathison began his climb of exploration around ramparts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other walls . He was so astounded by the inventive genius of the medieval mind  --  this place was a complex of fortresses guarding the Archbishop'spalace on the crest  --  that he stopped paying attention to the man who plodded behind him . One idea he did borrow from the man : he put on his Burberry to keep the sharp breeze from freezing him . He took his last photograph from a railed platform that **28;10154;TOOLONG had built to keep tourists from falling over the side of a bastion , and then stood with the wind whipping at his coat as he looked southward over the plain far below to the mountains with their jagged peaks . " Is it safe up there ? " a girl 's voice called . He turned to see her hesitating on the wooden steps ( again , courtesy of the twentieth century ) that led to his vantage point. ( 77 ) " Safe but cold , " he warned her , holding out his hand to steady her as she reached him . " The view is worth a chill , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An American ? " she asked , breaking into English . " You always can tell , can you ? " And I thought my accent was n't so bad , he thought ruefully . She was looking around her . " I never dare come up here alone , " she admitted , trying to clear her wind blown hair away from her eyes . She had n't much success . I icr hair was dark brown with golden lights in the rays of the late-afternoon sun , long tendrils escaping from her fingers as she reached to take hold of a railing . " Heights scare me a little . But it is a wonderful view . " " When you can see it , " he said with a grin . " Perhaps I ought to hold on to yon while you keep two hanel , on that hair . " He gripped her arm lightly while she smoothed her hair hack from her temples . But its length and thickness defeated her . " I give up , " she said . " Would you help edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must n't look at my feet or I freeze . " They retreated down the solidly built steps and stood in the calm of a sheltering wall . She found a comb in her pocket and combed the tangles out of her hair until it fell smoothly to her shoulders . Now he could see her eyes , wide-set and large , dark gray in color . " ' That 's hettet , " he told her approvingly . She smiled , pale pink lips curving softly , widely . There was a touch of pale pink , too , over the broad cheekbones , hut whether that was due to the wind or skillful application with a light sure hand , he could n't tell . Eyebrows and lashes were enchanting even if ' the sure hand had been at work again . A short nose and a rounded chin completed a pretty picture . He felt a touch of annoyance with himself , and some sadness too ; ten years ago , when he had been twenty-five , he would have just accepted the sum total rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he felt somehow that she was taking her own inventory . It could n't have been altogether adverse , for she was n't saying good-bye , walking on , leaving him to follow at a politedistance . Instead , she was beginning a conversation as she slipped the comb hack into the pocket of her coat . It was one of those expensive tweed jobs , fuzzy and soft yet somehow cut with slender shoulders , and its hemline was the shortest he had seen(78)since he had left New York . Her legs , fortunately , were excellent . He liked the white mesh stockings , too , and the flat-heeled shiny black shoes with their silver buckles . She was saying , " I have been wandering around here making my good-byes . What about you ? Is it hello or farewell ? " " Both . " They had begun walking slowly down a cobbled path . " You mean , " she said in horror , stopping abruptly , so that her heel almostskidded on a worn stone and he had to catch her elbow to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first and last visit ? " She looked down at his hand on her arm . " And thank you . You really are very quick , are n't you ? " " And tenacious , " he said with a grin , keeping hold of her arm . " I 'll just make sure you get along this road without twisting an ankle . Are you positive this is the right direction , by the way ? " " For what ? " " For a drink at that restaurant . There is one somewhere around here . " " Near the cable railway , " she told him . She gave him that same warm and charming smile . " And I think a drink would be perfect . We 'll give a toast to a quick return to Salzburg . You do intend to come back , do n't you ? " " I hope so . You sound as if you were a native . " " I 'm from Chicago . I came here last spring . But now  --  " She sighed quite openly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father refuses to send any more except for the fare home . Tomorrow I leave for Zurich to visit my grandmother for two or three weeks . Father 's orders . " She laughed then . " Zurich ? I may be there myself for a week or so . " " But how fantastic ! " she said delightedly , and halted abruptly again , almost slipping , letting her weight rest on his arm for a moment . " And how dutiful of you , " he said with amusement . " Do you always obey your father ? " " It 's economic necessity , " she reminded him severely . " What about a job ? If you like Salzburg so much  --  " " Oh , I made some extra money in the summer months . Translator , sort of a guide for special parties , that kind of thing . But the season is over now and jobs are scarce for foreigners . So it 's Zurich(79)for me . At least that gives me two more weeks abroad . Any excuse is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what about you ? Are you on holiday or business ? " " Business . " And he remembered the man whose business it had been to follow him . He glanced back , but the path was empty . So were the fortifications . The man had vanished . " The light 's fading , " he said . " We 'd better hurry . " She was somehow amused . " We 'll he all right . Look ! " She pointed to the courtyard lined with houses that lay ahead of them . There was a large tree with children playing around it , and lighted windows , and the sound of women 's voices as they worked indoors . " And that 's the main entrance gate around the corner at the other end . " So people lived up here , he thought . He kept an eye open for the man who had followed hint so persistently . He could see only half a dozen men , who looked like guides or caretakers or artisans . She was watching him curiously , as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly , " I suppose these are the fellows who build all those wooden catwalks and railings ? Now there 's one who is obviously a tester . " Ile pointed to a massive figure who was carryingan outsize tankard of beer across the sloping cobblestones . " His job is to jump three times daily on each wooden step so the tourists wo n't break their necks . " " Ile 's an artist , " she said with a faint giggle . " Some of them live up here , too , you know . There 's an international school of fine arts  --  I took some classes here last spring . " " You ate full of surprises . " " Ili , . Ian ! " she called to the artist , and waved . " I lallo ! " he called hack in German . " Do n't forget the dance next week ! " " He 's Polish " she explained as she walked on . " Refugee or de'rued party member ?  --  " Refugee . " She di.ent'ared het am from his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are leaving Salzburg , I 'll wait at the gate . " " I hate good-byes , " she said curtly . " Besides , artists never notice anyway whether you come to their parties or not . As long as there 's a crowd , they 're happy . " Now what did l say to annoy her ? he wondered . Or perhaps she(80)would like to be at that party more than she will admit . " Well , what about that toast to Salzburg and a quick return ? " he tried . " Let 's have it in town . " Her voice was back to normal . She glanced at her watch . " Yes , that 's the best idea . It always seems so spooky up here when it gets dark . " Or she might see more of her artist friends , he thought . And as she said , she hates good-byes . " Anything suits me . Do n't you think we had better start having names ? I 'm Bill  --  Bill Mathison . " She studied him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm Elissa . " " That suits you completely . " Soft , pretty and romantic , and different . " Elissa what ? " " Lang . Elissa Lang . It 's really Eliza-Evaline , shortened by me aged nine . " " Your first revolt against the family ? " " And my most successful one . Nothing since has been half so permanent . " " You have n't done too badly , " he said teasingly . " The last one brought you six months in Salzburg . " He made a guess at her age and thought of something around the early twenties , although in some ways she seemed older than that  --  it was difficult nowadays to pin a precise number of years on most women . " So what now ? Back to college ? " " I 've finished with all that , " she said indignantly . " It 's another world . " " No more picket lines , demonstrations , or LSD parties ? " " You know what ? I do n't believe you take me seriously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said softly . Then he retreated instinctively , and covered that slip in his emotions by looking at the view . They had come out of the gateway of the castle onto one of its lower terraces . Dusk was deepening rapidly . The lights in the town at their feet were a handful of diamonds scattered on a dark velvet cushion . On the black curve of river , the reflected gleam from the bridges was rippled by the strong currents . Almost reaching eye level were the peaks of the other hills that rose on either side of the riverbank . And far beyond all that  --  the mountains , ringing the town around . She studied his face . He is different from what I expected , she thought as she changed her mood to suit his . " Let 's walk down instead of taking the funicular , " she suggested . " It 's always fun to(81)see the domes and towers coming up to meet you . " Why , she thought again in surprise , this man may even be what he says he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with pretty prattle about their Excellencies the Prince-Archbishops who held court for centuriesin the heart of that fortress while their judges held court above the torture chambers , or about their mistresses , or about all the little footnotes to history which usually make an hour pass easily and safely . I might even relax and enjoy myself . He 's attractive , definitely ; a twentieth-century romantic . " And this is an eveningfor walking , is n't it ? " she added gently . She slipped her arm through his , and they started down the steep road . " It will have to be a very quick drink , " she said regretfully as they entered a bar-restaurant that lay , tucked into a spare space between two Grimm 's fairy-tale houses , on the narrow street near the base of the castle 's cliffs . She stole a glance at her watch and frowned a little . " You ca n't have dinner with me ? " Mathison asked , guessing what was coming , masking his disappointment , looking around for a quiet corner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice . Fortunately , the half-dozen customers were grouped before the bar , and the lighting was so artfully dim that they only appeared as a cluster of silhouettes in a haze of cigarette smoke . He pulled off his raincoat and hooked it on a wall . He selected the table farthest from people . " I 'm so sorry , Bill . " She stretched out a hand to touch his as he sat down beside her on a narrow bench against the roughly plasteredwall . " It 's my last night in Salzburg . I already promised  --  Oh , if only I had known we were going to meet  --  " She paused abruptly . Her voice brightened . " I have an idea . I 'll telephone while you order the drinks . Better stick to Scotch or beer . Avoid the Martinis . The man behind the bar is Italian and he is devoted to vermouth . " He watched her walk to the telephone near the door . She had her coat around her shoulders , and he had the odd idea that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip out of his life as quickly as she had stepped into it . But she came back to their table(82)as the drinks were arriving . She was walking slowly , and , as she reached him , he saw that the small frown had returned to her brow . It cleared as she became aware he was watching her . She sat down , pushing back the coat from her shoulders , and let him help case it off . But she looked dejected . " It ca n't be as bad as all that , " he said with amusement . " Did n't your idea work out ? " She shook her head . " I 've got to keep my appointment tonight  --  just ca n't even be late for it . Sorry . " " We 'll have dinner in Zurich . " " Where are you staying ? " " I may have to move . A bankers ' conference is going to take up most of the rooms next week . But what 's your address ? " " My grandmother lives out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be in Zurich often enough . I have a friend there who will put me up at her apartment if I stay overnight . " " Then give me her number . " She hesitated . " I wonder . You see  --  " She was trying to soften her excuse . Then she shrugged her pretty shoulders , looked down at her bare arms . " I do n't like bothering my friend too much . There is nothing so annoying as a phone that keeps ringing not for you but for someone else . She  --  well , she  --  " " I promise I wo n't pester her . I 'll only call once and leave a message that I 'm in town . She would n't object to that , would she ? " He had his address book and pencil ready . She gave him a number , slowly , as if she were trying to remember it , or perhaps because she had something else on her mind . " That saves a lot of trouble , " he told her reassuringly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office number , but there 's a dragon called Miss Freytag who guards the entrance to Yates 's office  --  that 's the head man around there  --  and she is allergic to social calls . Business is business is business . " She was sitting very still . Suddenly , she laughed and said , " No , I do n't think I want to leave any messages with a dragon . She 'd breathe flames all over them . " She looked down at her hands . " When do you expect to reach Zurich ? And how long will you stay ? " " I 'm not sure in either case . I 'll know more about it later to-night . " ( 83 ) " You are so mysterious . " She sounded as if that idea delighted her . Her eyes turned briefly to look at the door as two people entered . " There 's nothing very mysterious about a phone call from New York . " " From your friend the publisher ? You know , you never did tell me why he sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wrist , studied her hands . It was exactly six o'clock . " Just a simple matter of checking on a contract for a book . " The door of the restaurant opened again , and this time a man entered . As he took off his dark-gray coat , he looked around the room . Seemingly he decided against a table and went to the bar instead . " It must be wonderful , " she said , now completely relaxed , half dreaming , " to have a job like yours . I mean , a real career with travel as part of it . " " That only happens now and again . I 'm mostly in New York . " " You never think of going back to Denver ? Why did n't you settle there after law school ? You sounded as if you liked open-air life . " He laughed , thinking that she had learned quite a lot of little things about him on that walk down from the castle . But although he had long got over Nora and a broken marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overseas  --  he was n't the type to talk about something that had once almost broken him too . When a man had been spread-eagled on that kind of wheel , he became very wary of any repeat performance . There had been Joan and Mary , Clarissa and Peggy and  --  yes , there had been plenty of them , perhapstoo many . A man got into a routine of independence just as easily as the routine of suburban commuter . " But do n't you ? Bill  --  what do you really like ? " " That 's quite a question  --  " he began , and stopped short in surprise . She had looked at her watch , openly this time , and was rising as she pulled her coat back over her shoulders . He rose to his feet , looked around for the waitress to pay his bill . " No , please do n't come . Finish your drink , Bill . " " Nonsense ! I 'll walk you home . " " But I 'm not going there . My friends are waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theater . We are driving out to Schloss Fuschl for dinner . " ( 84 ) " Very gemiitlich , " he said . And the message was very clear : a car meant a fixed number of people ; if he took her to meet her friends it would only look as if he were trying to crash their party . He helped her put on her coat properly . " Sorry I kept you . " " I 'm not . " She was smiling up at him as he took her hand . " I never knew that walk down from the castle could take so much time . I usually do it in twelve minutes . " Impulsively , she kissed him on his cheek . " And I do want an answer to my question . I 'll hear it in Zurich , " she said very softly . Then she was walking to the door , her heels clicking lightly on the tiled floor . Mathison sat down at the table . It was small and lonely . he finished his drink , paid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him seemed small and lonely , too . Damn it all , he told himself angrily , you were a perfectly happy man wandering around by yourself this morning , or exploring the castle this afternoon before you met any Elissa . You are still you , and Salzburg is still Salzburg , and that 's that . He was at the door when he remembered his camera lying on the bench where they had sat . He turned to retrace his steps and almost collided with a man who was unhooking his dark-gray coat from a wall peg . Well , he did n't stay long , thought Mathison ; did his girl stand him up ? He left the little room with its warm smoke-spiraling air , the encrusted candles guttering low on red tablecloths , the crowded pack of baying voices at the bar , and stepped out into a street that was now dark with early-autumn night , and cold . He was thinking of Elissa 's last question . Bill  --  what do you really like ? A man could answer that differently every five years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned down the short run of narrow street to reach the square with the marble horsepond . He was so deep in his own thoughts that he never noticed the man in the dark-gray coat who walked a discreet distance behind him. ( 85 ) 7At six o'clock , Johann Kronsteiner drove back to Unterwald from the scene of Bryant 's death . The village was quieter now than when he had first arrived over an hour ago . The groups of people had faded away into the warmth of their lighted kitchens , talking in subdued voices about the accident that had taken place only a few miles from their own home . The where of the accident seemed to shock them as much as the how of it . It was this constant murmur of " accident " that had made Johann drive to St. George 's Church even if the light was fading rapidly and he would have to scramble down to the burned-out car with a flashlight in one hand . One of the policemen from the Gendarmerie at Bad Aussec had accompaniedhim ; two were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inn  --  he had gone hunting up around Finstersee , it was said , and had n't yet heard about the burned car  --  and the fourth policeman had left with the ambulance and Richard Bryant'sbody . Now , as he swung himself out of his jeep , Johann saw that Felix Zauner was standing at Postmistress Kogel 's door ( it was one of the few houses where there was a telephone , Johann remembered , and if he had n't been plunged into gloom he would have been amused at Felix 's artful position ) , and there was Trudi , too , waiting anxiously , keeping Felix company . Ile called his thanks to the Gerdarme and went over to the lighted door . Trudi took his hand . He stood close beside her , but he said nothing at all . " Did you get down to the ravine ? " Felix asked ( 86 ) Johann nodded . The car had cooled off enough to let him examineit . " Then you saw the body behind the steering wheel ? " The charred corpse had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no possible escape for him . No rossihle identificationeither . Trudi Seidl said in her soft voice , " Who could it have been ? There 's no one missing from Unterwald . Besides , we saw the car drive through the village . There was only one man in it then . " She was a dark-haired , dark-eyed girl with glowing cheeks and an easy laugh , but tonight there was no smile on her full red lips and she watched Johann anxiously . " The police say it could have been a hiker  --  there was a Frenchman here on a walking tour . He stayed with my aunt last night ; the inn was closed , old Grell said . He left before eight this morning . Do you think it was him ? " " Did it take him two and a half hours to hike to St. George 's ? " Felix said , " He could have visited the church to see the wood carvings , or strained an ankle , or anything . We wo n't know he is n't the man until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He could have cut down to the valley , taken a bus or a train from there , and be in Munich by this time . " Johann looked hard at Felix . And you should have said that , he thought . Trudi 's worry increased . She found the logical solution . " Come and have supper with us , Johann . " Johann looked at a lighted ground-floor window of the Gasthof Waldesruh , perched on its meadow above the village . " I 'll go to the inn first . August Grell is back , I see . " " The Gendarmen are talking with him now . He only got back half an hour ago . " " And young Anton ? Where is he ? " " But did n't you know ? " asked Trudi . " He 's on holiday . He left last week . " Johann looked at Felix again , standing there so silently with one foot on Frau Kogel 's threshold . " Did you find out if anyone saw him leave ? " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know how it roars . It woke everyone up in the village last Thursday morning . Johann , what 's wrong with you ? " " Johann has a theory and he does n't want it spoiled , " Felix(87)Zauner said wearily . He cocked his head as the telephone rang . " Excuse me . " He hurried indoors . " He 's been doing that for the last hour , either sending calls to Salzburg or getting them , " Trudi said . " He 's a funny kind of man . I never know what he 's thinking . " " He 's just worrying about his business back in Salzburg . Never thinks anyone can do anything right except himself . " " It was some day he chose to come up and try again to talk old Grell into his ski-lodge idea . Does n't he take a refusal ? " So that is Felix 's story for being at Unterwald , Johann thought . But why is n't he at Waldesruh , right now , watching Grell 's face as the two Gendarmen talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's for sure , but they certainly are n't mine . He bit his lip and frowned , then blew his nose . " Damn this cold , it 's almost better but I ca n't think straight . " All he kept feeling was that he and Felix were being drawn apart , and he could n't understand any of it . Felix , the bright one , did n't seem to be aware of it , while he , who never pretended to be one of the clever ones , was seeing a long friendship  --  well , not end exactly , but certainly change . I 've never criticized Felix before , he thought , and the idea disturbed him . " Come and eat with us , " Trudi pleaded . " Later . But I 'll give you a lift to your house . " " I 'll keep some food for you . " She drew her heavy cardigan tighter around her throat . " Are you sure you are warmly enough dressed ? I do n't like the sound of your cold . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped her into the jeep . They drove the short distance in silence . " I 'll leave the car here , " he told her , driving it over the grass to the side of the house . " I may be very late . " " I 'll wait . " She always did . He kissed her , hugging her close . Then abruptly he picked up his loden cape from the jeep and started back to the main street of the village . It was sparsely lit , especially now that the curtains were drawn over the windows . But there was a smell of wood smoke in the sharp air , a reminder of warm stoves and supper tables and familiessafely gathered together . What was it that Dick used to say about the villagers ? Easy live and quiet die . . . For a moment , he envied them and thought of Trudi . But what chance had he of(88)marrying her now , of marrying anyone ? He 'd have a sister to look after for the rest of her life . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earner ; she only helped him complete the photographs he had taken . She could n't afford to pay the rent on Neugasse 9 . And after she sold all the equipment , and squared any debts , what would she have left ? That 's a hell of a thought to have on the day your brother-in-law died , he told himself angrily . But it was there to nag him , and he could n't forget it . Money was something he used to laugh at ; he made it , he spent it , and he did n't want too much of it , for it did strange things to a man . Tied him down to possessions , turned him into something different , and not always for the best . Money might breed plenty of evil , but the lack of it could be the root of misery . His depression increased . Felix Zauner was waiting for him at the corner of Frau Kogel 's house . " Everything under control in Salzburg ? " Johann could n't resist asking , but Felix did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own thoughts . " Coming ? " Johann was already three steps on the way to the Gasthof Waldesruh . Felix caught his arm and pulled him back into the shadows of the Kogel eaves . " Must you , Johann ? " " I 've a good excuse : I 'm the brother-in-law . " " But why go up there ? If he is what you think he is , Grell could become suspicious of you . He might think Bryant told you more about Finstersee than he actually did . " Felix pulled his green velourshat farther down over his high brow ; the lines at the corners of his eyes deepening as he looked at Johann narrowly . " It is n't possiblethat Bryant did tell you more ? You are n't keeping anything back , are you , Johann ? " " I told you all I knew . And I 'm telling you now that Dick 's death is no accident . Do you really believe he would let any stranger drive that car ? He did n't even let me touch it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hands . He might have been glad to let someone else drive . What caused those marks , I wonder ? " The quiet voice was casual , the gray eyes sharp . " I do n't know . I 'm going to ask old Grell if Dick explained them to him . " " Be careful what you say to Grell , " Felix warned again . " Do n't even hint you think it was n't an accident . " ( 89 ) Johann stared at Felix . Then he nodded . " I might be next on Grell 's list ? " he asked , trying to joke it off . But he felt too close to the truth to get much humor into his voice . " You know there is something wrong about the whole thing . For instance , why was Dick only wearing his sweater ? The villagers saw him , or someone , driving in his green jacket . " " He was too warm , he removed it . " " You find an answer for everything . " " Johann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to get them . It may take a little time , but we 're going to find them and rout them out . " " And send them with a smack on their knuckles back across the border ? Why do n't you get them on a murder charge ? Then you 'd have them  --  permanently . " Felix Zauner 's patience slipped . " Because , you idiot , a murder trial would bring out the reason why Bryant was killed . We want no more interest in Finstersee . " " And if the Nazis pull up that box from Finstersee ? " " How can they , if we 've scattered them ? It will be a long time before any try to come back to Unterwald . Once we gut out the nest , they wo n't have a place to operate from . They 'll have to replan , rethink every bit of their organization here . They 'll keep trying , of course , but we 'll keep watching . And they will know that . I told you in Salzburg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming ? " Johann moved off slowly . " We had better not go in together . When 1 do join you  --  " " I 'll scarcely know you . " " And take care ! He has a couple of possible friends up there with him . " Johann halted . " Who ? " " Two strangers who came here this evening . They 're putting up at the inn for a few days of shooting . Trudi 's aunt has been making beds and cooking all afternoon . " Felix grinned . " And that 's my excuse . The inn is open . I 'll have dinner there . Maybe even stay the night . " " By God , " Johann looked at helix with frank admiration , " I believe you would . " He turned on his heel and crossed the street , following the line of houses until he reached the trail that branched(90)up toward Finstersee . He climbed it for a few minutes until he reached the Waldesruh meadow with its short path to the inn 's front door . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could n't see Felix , but Felix would be watching him , timing his entry . Did Zauner really enjoy this kind of life ? he wondered . He rapped hard on the oak door and then opened it . The big ceramic stove in the dining room had been lit , but Frau Hitz had to wear a shawl around her shoulders while she set a table . She was in one of her cross moods . She was tired . She had been at work since Herr Grell had sent word this noon that he wanted the whole place aired and cleaned and heated , not his room , of course  --  she was rarely allowed inside it , and never alone  --  but there was plenty to do without that and a full dinner to cook besides . " They 're in there , " she said as a return for Johann 's greeting . " Drinking . " And she nodded her head , sparse-covered with thin white hair pulled back in a knot from her white face , toward the kitchen . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's world where women scrubbed the floors and men trailed over them in dirty boots . She looked at Johann 's shoes , earthcaked , and went on with her work . They were laughing in the kitchen , and warm , with their coats off and their legs stretched out . Johann loosened the collar of his cape . " I 'm Kronsteiner , " he said . " Can I see you for a minute , Herr Grell ? " He nodded to Karl and Max , the policemen from Bad Aussee , whom he knew well . He merely glanced at the two welldressed , well-fed strangers who sat apart . The laughter died into silence . August Grell , red-faced and beaming , had been refilling the beer mugs . " Come in . Sit down . Will you have some beer ? " Then he halted , his expression changing to one of sympathy . " You are Herr Bryant 's brother-in-law ? Herr Kronsteiner , forgive me . I did n't recognizeyou in your winter clothes . I ca n't tell you how sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You were the last to see my brother-in-law , I believe . " My voice is too tight , Johann thought , I 'll have to ease up . He was conscious of the strangers ' eyes studying him . He said to Max , who was the senior of the two men from Bad Aussee , " I suppose you 've already asked most of the questions  --  " ( 91 ) " We have , Johann . There 's nothing that is any help . Herr Grell met your brother-in-law up at the picnic ground , and invited him back here for breakfast . " " And nothing stronger than coffee was drunk , I assure you , " Grell said . " Was he ill ? " " No . He was cold and slightly damp . He had been caught in the mist . And he had scarred his hands on some rocks . Apart from that , he was well . A bit anxious about his wife . He telephoned her . " " I know . I was staying with them in Salzburg for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't seem to be able to get an opening . " That 's all that can he said , I suppose . Where 's Anton ? " Grell 's placid face did not move a muscle . " He 's in Bozen . " " Back in the South Tyrol ? " Johann asked , startled . " Is n't that dangerous for him ? After all , he left it without permission of the Italians . " " He has Austrian papers now . He 'll be all right . " Grell seemed amused . " He is hoping to bring his girl when he returns . At least , he is trying to persuade her to come north . They will be here next week if he has any luck . Did you have some message for him ? " " No . I just thought he must be here . In that telephone call  --  " Grell was watching him politely . " Yes ? " " My sister thought her husband said he was having breakfast with the Grells . " Grell looked bewildered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are you sure she did n't say at the Grells ' ? There 's quite a difference in one small word . " He turned to his guests . " It 's too bad that Anton wo n't be here to guide you around tomorrow . But perhapswe could persuade Herr Kronsteiner to take his place . He knows these mountains well . You like hunting , do n't you , Herr Kronsteiner ? " He faced Johann with a genial smile , his blue eyes widely innocent . " There will be funeral arrangements , " Johann said in a low voice . Grell 's smile faded . " Forgive mc . I am so sorry . And please conveymy deepest sympathy to Frau Bryant . " From the hall beyond the dining room there was Felix Zauner 's voice calling , " Where is everybody ? Grell ? " Then his brisk foot-(92)steps echoed over the wooden floors and stopped at the kitchen door . Under his arm he had some heavy sheets of paper in a loose roll . " Glad to see the inn is open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone . He looked at the large stove where pots were drawn to the side of the heat , keeping warm , smelling deliciously . " Makes business more pleasurable when a good meal precedes it . " 1 le held up the roll of paper . " I had these diagrams and maps drawn to scale . They 'll prove we do n't intend to ruin Unterwald , " he told Grell . " When are you serving dinner ? Soon , I hope . This autumn air makes me  --  " He caught sight of Johann , and his voice changed . " I was sorry to hear about the accident , Kronsteiner . Very sorry . " Max placed his beer mug carefully on the table and rose . Karl did the same . " Yes , " said Max as his parting word , " it was a bad thing , a very bad thing . But there was one mercy , Johann . Your brother-in-law died quickly , painlessly . " " Yes , " said Karl , " not like that other fellow in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his screams in the village . " He beamed around on them all , joined Max in his thanks for the beer , and lumbered out the back door after him . Johann watched the grin on Grell 's broad red face , forced and now fixed , as if Grell had summoned it and could not dismiss it . The two strangers sat unmoving . " Good night , " Johann said , and followed the two policemen into the yard . As he closed the door , he could still see that rigid parting of Grell 's lips . Felix Zauner was saying quickly as he moved back into the diAing room , " I 'll get rid of my coat . Frau Hitz , would you be so kind as to show me where I might wash my hands ? " Grell listened to Zauner 's retreating footsteps . He said , " Do n't worry about him . He 's just a sharp businessman . When he leaves , we can talk . " His guests had risen to their feet , but one of them had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching Johann Kronsteiner . " That brother-in-law is the one I 'm worried about , " he said in a hushed voice . " What about Bryant 's wife ? " the other asked . " We 'll have to talk over that problem , " Grell said . " There have been two men watching her house all day . " " Ours ? " ( 93 ) " No . We think they were the men that Yates asked for . But who gave them Bryant 's address ? Yates certainly could n't reach them today . " There was a thin smile on the normally pleasant mouth . " Then there is someone in Salzburg who serves as a contact for Yates , " Grell said thoughtfully . " Someone who was alerted by Yates before we picked him up this morning . " " That 's possible . We were only monitoring his Warsaw sendings . If he made a telephone call to Salzburg  --  well , that was something we could n't intercept . We find that he has at least two addresses in Zurich as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Who was he working for ? The Soviets ? " " I do n't think so . " The thin smile appeared again . " It was a Soviet agent who tipped us oil about Yates . " " Was Yates working for the Americans then ? " " No . Definitely not . Ile has done enough harm to them to  --  " Grell held up a warning hand as his ears caught the first sounds of distant footsteps , passing through the hall . The tight group of men separated to a more normal distance , raised their voices from a low ninimur to a natural tone . " Yes , " Grell was saying as he beganleading the way into the dining room , " the chamois have disappeared . They seem to have all gone to the south of Styria . However , you never know your luck . Frau Hitz ! Are you ready to serve dinner ? " Johann had halted at the corner of the inn to light a cigarette . Drawing ahead of him , the motorcycle and sidecar bumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Karl . Then it turned right for the road down to the Gendarmerie at Bad Aussee , its coughing and sputtering giving way to a steady growl . It was a clear night , almost cloud free , with the first stars glittering . The gibbous noon hung low in the sky ; it would take another couple of hours before it was high enough to spread its light full on the mountainsides . The time could n't be better : the village was silent ; Grell and his friends would soon be at dinner ; Felix was safely occupied . And 1 , thought Johann , ant having supper with Trudi . He threw away his cigarette and took the road to Finstersee . He made it in a quick fifteen minutes . Walking was as easy as breathing to him , and the night held no problems once he had ' ( 94 ) cleared the lights of Grell 's kitchen out of his eyes . The liar , he thought bitterly , liar and liar and liar . So Dick was having breakfastat the Grells ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she had been quite definite : Dick was having breakfast with August and Anton Grell . Those were her words . Perhaps , he decided , it was lucky for me that I did n't tell them that . They did n't like me much . He halted at the edge of the picnic ground , studying the moon . Its light was even weaker here , cut off as it was by the mountain peaks that rose high above the lake . The first thing to do was to reach the small clump of trees and boulders on its north shore and try to find out if Dick had really been there . With the careful use of the flashlight that now weighed down the pocket of his cape , he might find some traces , some tracks . ( He had enough experience in finding lost climbers who had strayed in the mists and been trapped in blind corners . ) And if he found any sign that Dick had been crazy enough to visit that spot just above the ledge in the lake ? Then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll know it really was murder , Johann thought . And if Felix wo n't take action , then by God I will . He crossed the meadow , intending to cut up through the wood toward the track along the mountain 's lower slope . His eyes , scanningthe shadows around him , rested on the black shape of the picnictable . So this was where Grell had met Dick , was it ? Another lie , possibly . He halted his steady pace , wondering what actually had happened , feeling the impossibility of ever reaching the truth through the maze of lies that Grell would invent . But at least there would be one piece of testimony from Anna about who was actually at the inn this morning . Anna did n't lie , AnnaIncongruously , his mind jumped from Anna to the burned-out car . Yet logically , too . Anna said Dick took his diving gear with him . But the gaping mouth of the car 's trunk had held only four blackened remains : the hub and twisted rim of what had been a spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the back seat of the car , there was a crumpled small box that had once been the metal frame of a camera . Much of any diving gear would burn into ashes , but what about the weights in a belt , or a buckle , or clamps ? What about a knife , a flashlight , or any metal parts in the scuba tank ? The knife at least could n't have burned to nothing. ( 95 ) Had Dick thrown his gear away ? Not likely on the kind of money he made . Not likely with a job still to be done . Still to be done ? Johann walked slowly over to the picnic table , put his foot up on a bench , rested one elbow on his knee as he stared across the short stretch of lake toward the hidden ledge . He was remembering now the marks on Dick 's palms . Rope marks . Ile had seen that kind of scar often enough ; it happened to him if he slipped on a rock face and dangled briefly over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope for a partner 's descent and lost his grip for even one second . " God in heaven , " he said softly . His thoughts raced . Dick had done the job , had thrown the divingequipment away . And Anna had told a lie . She said Dick had found nothing . . . . Wait a minute , wait a minute , he reminded himself . You said Dick never would have been having breakfast at the inn with that chest lying in his car . You said that . And you asked , " Would he ? " And her answer was " No . " . . . The chest had never been hidden in the car . Dick had hidden it someplace else . Where ? Not on that bleak , bare mountainside . Not in the wood that led there : it was too vulnerable with hunters around ; it was too close to the trail , too obvious . Dick was a cautious man . He would choose a hiding place that could be easily reached without attractingsuspicion when the time came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his friends the British could find without too much trouble . A place that Anna could identify for them , if things went wrong . Anna . . . Suddenly he remembered this morning in the shop , remembered the way she had frozen beside him when that American had stopped at the detailed picture of Finstersee . He had frozen , too , because of his growing suspicions about the American . But was that Anna 's reason ? Or was the American looking at the hiding place ? As I ant doing now ? he wondered in disbelief . He stared at the three boulders , silvered gray in the spreading moonlight . Impossible , he kept telling himself . I 've passed that picture in the shop a dozen times , thought nothing of it , it 's a  --  what did the American call it ?  - -  a study in texture to show what a damned artisticphotographer Dick could be . And to display it right there in the shop ? Madness , complete madness . Except , he reminded himself , ( 96 ) you passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he giving it a second thought right now if you had n't hccn standing close to Anna in the shop this morning , or if you had found one trace of diving gear in a ruined car . He broke the spell of his thoughts , started across the soft grass . As he came closer to the boulders , he could see the black line of shadow where two met . Nothing could be hidden there . It was only a narrow cleft , a miniature crevasse . His excitement ebbed , and he was left with the hollow feeling of the man who has deluded him self . He was turning away when he noticed the withered flowers and the rosebush . Their shadow was n't as heavy as all that . He knelt , pulling them roughly aside , and found the cleft had spread as it reached the ground . He took out his flashlight and aimed its beam into the black hole . He saw the straps of a rucksack , and pulled . He had to lay aside the flashlight and pull with both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crushed the flower stalks , caught in the brambles . He tore it free . It was the chest , all right . He knelt there for a long minute , not even touching the chest . And then he moved quickly . He hoisted the rucksack on his back , covering it with his cape . He pocketed the flashlight , pushed the dried stalks of grass and flowers back into place with his foot , and made for the nearest group of trees . From there , he reached the sparse edge of forest and slipped into its depths . There was no need to worry about cover now , only about direction , and his sense of that was built into him . Before he neared the back of the inn , he began a wide circle to avoid the village , making a long detour around the farthest stretch of fields . By the time he reached Trudi 's house , he could feel sure that no one had seen him . His jeep was standing in the deep shadows of the western side of the Seidl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop the rucksack into the back seat and take off . But he was exhausted , although he 'd recover quickly enough with some food and warmth ; and he was hungry . His last meal had been breakfast . And Trudi would be waiting . The heavy door was unlatched . He pushed it open carefully  --  it was old like the house itself and groaned easily . He stepped over the raised stone threshold that kept the kitchen free of any floor drafts , closed the door slowly , and paused . Trudi had left one small(97)lamp , well trimmed , on the big table that stood in the center of the scrubbed wooden floor . There was food there , too , and the wood ashes in the old-fashioned fireplace glowed warmly . It was more friendly than any stove , he had to admit , although he had often been amused by the way Trudi 's father had insisted on keeping that open fireplace , wide and black and smoke-stained , just because his grandfather and great-grandfather and their great-grandfathers had used it , Yes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oldest in the village . The wonder was it held together and kept the winter wind out  --  better than his own new house down at Bad Aussee . Gently he lowered the rucksack onto the floor at the bottom of the stairs that led up to Trudi 's room . Her mother slept in a room at the back of the kitchen ( once it had been part of the barn when Trudi 's father farmed here ) ; he could hear her steady breathing through the wall . He eased off his shoes as he unfastened his cape , and left them beside the rucksack . He moved silently toward the table and its covered plates . This was Trudi 's way of saying , " Here 's something to cat , and if you are too tired to sec mc , do n't bother . I waited long enough , and I 'm fast asleep anyway . " She never meant it , of course . It was just to remind him that if he was an independenttype , so was she . Or at least tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a happy grin . Ile ate c ' , erything she had left for him . ' l'hcrc had been enough for two men , and he needed it all . IIc sat for a while , his back comfortably near the warm hearth , and almost fell asleep . He roused himself . At least he had decided hat to do with the rucksack . I lc had even answered the question why he had not left it in its hiding place . It was only safe there as long as Dick had been alive . l lis death recant that someone like ( itell had been suspicious of him ; and ( hell was n't the man to let  --  , icspiciuns wither away without a search . If I could tied the hidinr , place , Johann reasoned , so could ( ; cell . So could that Atneric ; ur , the lawyer fellow , who studied the photographs so intently . Yes , ( ) nee anyone guessed the chest was no longer sunk in the lake , the hunt would be on . Ile rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staircase . He lifted the rucksack and began his cautious climb , avoiding the third and ninth steps that creaked badly . Ile was careful with the upper landing , too . Inside Trudi 's door , he could relax and move(98)without such exaggerated caution . It always amused him , but k : : . part of the gamble and added to the fun of the chaos . She hid h her curtains undrawn so that the moonlight would hoopfalling over the heavy furniture . He laid the rucksack Wilde  --  chest that stored all her carefully embroidered linens etilkcttn a the day she would marry . He looked at the rucksack and then at the sleeping girl , dark hair loose on the soft pillow . Marriage WS something he could now afford . The thought nearly drove him out the door and back down the staircase . Then she turned in her sleep , sighing a little , stretching her body under the white mound of eiderdown . He stripped off his clothes , dropping them on the floor . He bent over her , half wakening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobe gently . " Anyone at home ? " he asked softly as he pulled the eiderdown aside . Trudi awakened him at four o'clock as she always did . " Time to go , " she whispered . She was already out of bed , wrapped in the heavy dressing gown he had given her last Christmas . The curtains had been tightly drawn and a candle lit . " Too early , " he grumbled , but she was shaking out his clothes , handing them to him one by one . He dressed slowly , longing for another hour of soft warm sleep . But Trudi was right . Time to leave before the village was stirring . Then he saw the rucksack and became wide awake . " Look , Trudi  --  I 've got to go to Salzburg . I wo n't have time to stop off at my place . Would you keep this for me until I get back ? " He nodded to the rucksack . " Of course . " She looked at it curiously . " What is it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was thrown clear of the car . " He looked around the room , frowning . " We do n't want your mother to find it and start asking questions about how it got here . Does she come up here much ? " " No , her leg hurts her badly . The stairs  --  " " Even so , we 'd better be careful . We do n't want people to start talking . " She agreed with that . She watched him as he tried to draw the chest out of the rucksack , and then stared in horror as he took out his knife and slashed the canvas sides . " What a waste  --  " she(99)began . " Oh , it 's filthy ! " She stared at the metal box with distaste . " Get an old towel , will you ? It will soon clean off . " " It needs a good scrub , " she told him , but together they began to get most of the dried green slime removed . " It must be valuable ; look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's very valuable . For Anna 's sake . She 'll need every penny she can get for it . Look , love  --  once the funeral is over , I 'll bring Anna out to my place , and she can get this box then . We 'll keep it a secret between us . Right ? " " Wo n't the police want to  --  " " It is n't their business . It 's Anna 's . Now where will we put it ? " " Under the bed . " The suggestion was so simple , so typical , that he almost smiled . " In here , " he said , and lifted the lid of her linen chest . " No ! " " Trudi , " he said gently , catching her around the waist with his free arm , " do you know that 's the very first ' No ' you 've ever given me ? And just when I need your help most . Please , Trudi . We 'll wrap it in a sheet . It can lie underneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , love . " He kissed her neck , her chin , her lips . She still strained away from him . " All right . I 'll just have to take Dick 's equipment to my place and try to hide it safely there . " He let go of her completely . " Is it as valuable as that ? " she asked slowly . " But surely no one would want to steal it . " " Would n't they ? Do you know how much one of Dick 's cameras cost him ? Fifteen thousand schillings , and that was at a discount too . " She looked at him , completely shocked . " So that box means money . Money for Anna . I wo n't have to worry about her future . I can think of my own . I can think of getting married , settling down . " He hesitated , branched off to the main problem . " Oh , well  --  I must take the box down to my own house , try to find a  --  " Trudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , Johann . Nothing is properly locked , the door key is where everyone can find it , and people keep wandering in and out to see you . No , no , that would n't do . Not if this box is so valuable . " " It is. " ( 100 ) She began lifting embroidered mats and bolster cases and eiderdowncovers and stacks of towels onto her bed . The green-stained metal box was hidden . The linen was replaced after some rearrangement by Trudi to allow for the addition to her hope chest . " Mein eigene Aussteuer , " she said softly , sadly , as she closed its lid . Johann caught her up in a massive hug . " It could be part of your trousseau , " he said in his relief . " Once Anna is settled  --  " He could have bitten his tongue , but the promise was half out , and Trudi had seized it . Her arms went around his shoulders . " Oh , Johann ! " She kissed him over and over again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we can get married ! " " Trudi , Trudi , we 're late . Your mother will soon  --  " She released him with a laugh . " That does n't matter now . " " Oh yes , it does . We 'll keep things just as they are . Meanwhile . Our secret . Right ? " He picked up the rucksack . That must leave with him . Trudi would wash it and try to mend it . Better not have it lying around here . " Our secret , " she promised him . Her eyes were bright , her face glowing with happiness . He gave her a last kiss . " You really are my best girl , " he said softly . Johann dropped the rucksack , covered by his folded cape , onto the front seat of the jeep and released its brake . He began pushing it away from the wall of the Seidl house . It was an easy and quiet exit , for the ground sloped downward to the road . " Very efficient , " Felix Zauner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some help ? " He was bundled up warmly , but he looked peaked and cold . " This would have to be the morning you oversleptby twenty minutes . " " I tell you too much , " Johann said , recovering himself as they both pushed . Quickly , the jeep swung onto the dark road that ran downhill to Bad Aussee . " Do you want a lift ? " " No . I am going back to my bed at Frau Hitz 's place . She put me up for the night . Grell had only two rooms prepared at the inn . " " I thought you sounded a bit sharp-set. " ( 101 ) " You sound on edge yourself . Anything wrong ? " Johann stared at Zauner through the cold bleak shadows . " I think I just asked her to marry me . " Zauner whistled softly . " And what is Elisabetha going to say about that ? " Johann shrugged . Elisabetha was not the kind of girl who married . " I 'm just a change from her Salzburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Zauner said nothing . Johann had more sense than he had realized . Elisabetha , for all her charm and good looks , was a girl who brought misery . Ile clapped Johann 's shoulder . " You will be better off with ' I rudi Seidl . " Johann said nothing . " You love her , do n't you ? " " I guess I do . " ' There was a touch of amazement in Johann 's voice . Zauncr was amused . " 1 do n't see you as a married man . " " Neither do I. " Zauner 's grin widened . " Let 's get out of the cold , " he said and climbed into the jeep , pushing the cape aside to make room . " Take me down as far as the first tree . I 've got some news for you . " He waited until Johann started up the engine , and once it was running smoothly enough he began talking . " It 's about Anna . She did n't stay with the I ) ietrichs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out when Frieda and the children were having supper . She went home . She phoned them from there  --  at least , the American phoned them . I-Ic waited until Frieda came around to spend the night with Anna . So she 's all right . But  --  " Felix Zauner 's lips closed tightly , and he said no more . " The American was with her ? " Johann stopped the jeep . They were almost at the tree anyway . " That lawyer fellow ? " " Mathison . " " What in hell is going on ? " " ' That 's what 1 'd like to know . What are your plans ? " " I was going to wash and change and then drive into Salzburg. " " l ) o that . As far as we know , they met accidentally . But  --  " Again there was that silence . " Is he a lawyer ? " " We are finding that out . You know  --  " Zauner was choosing his words carefully  --  " there seems to be a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , who stayed last night with Frau Hitz . She tells me he asked a lot of questions about visitors to the village . And three days ago , she gave a midday meal to two inquisitiveforeigners who were also on a walking tour . She thought they were either Czech or Polish . They asked about visitors , too . " " Well , they were n't asking about Finstersee . " But in spite of his cockiness , Johann was worried . " They will do more than ask about the lake if they hear of a violent death  --  " " Murder , " Johann said determinedly . " What motive was there ? " Johann had the impulse to say , " Plenty . You are sitting against Dick 's rucksack right now  --  yes , it 's under my cape . I found it where he had hidden it . " But he clamped his lips shut . There was a brief silence . He gave Felix one last chance . " You do n't want to name it murder , is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll get Grell and his friends  --  if they are connected with it . " So this is where we part , Johann thought . He said angrily , " But not as murderers . " " You 're a vindictive son of a bitch , " Felix said lightly , and opened the jeep door . " I 'll be staying up here for a day or so . I may yet persuade Grell to keep his inn open as a ski lodge . I did n't learn much tonight . They are a careful trio ; they talk a lot and say nothing . But I had one small triumph . I rather think I have established peaceful relations with Frau Hitz . She should be a most valuable ally . " He got out of the car , looked around him . The stars were almost gone ; the moon was a pale ghost . " The most god-forsaken hour in the whole day . " " How do I get in touch with you ? At the Postmistress 's  --  " " Better not call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach me . Give my love to Anna . " " How long was she with the American ? " " I understand they met around half past six . They walked for almost an hour . And then he accompanied her home . But why do n't you get to Salzburg and ask her yourself ? " Johann shifted from neutral into first and started with a roar down the hill . Now that was unnecessary , thought Felix Zauner . He began walking up toward the silent village. ( 103 ) Around half past six , Johann was thinking . Just what had Mathisonin mind ? Some answers to a problem called Finstersee ? Well , whatever the American had guessed or found out , it would do him little good . Not now . Let them all search Finstersee. 1(104)At half past six , Bill Mathison had had nothing at all on his mind except the problem of dinner . It was too early to find a restaurant for that , and he seemed to have little luck in discovering another bar in this part of Salzburg where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , this section of the town seemed devoted to large squares and fountains looking as lonely as himself at this hour . But perhaps his mood was colored by his disappointment over Elissa . It had all seemed to be going so damned well ; and then the pleasant prospect had blown up in his face . A strange mixture , Elissa Lang : helpless , dependent , softly appealing ; then capable , brisk , most definitely her own mistress . It could have been a really interesting evening . Well , there was always Zurich to continue what Schloss Fuschl had ended . He had passed the massive front of the Cathedral and was headed for the arcades . Abruptly , he stopped and glanced back . Anna Bryant ? Surely not . It was a woman , alone , standing in front of the giant doors , looking up at a church spire across the square , blindly staring , seeing nothing . Was she ill ? He hesitated . It was Anna Bryant all right ; fair hair silvered under the square 's lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marble statues of the Cathedral behind her . She paid no attention to those who walked by . Waiting for someone ? he wondered . He almost walked on , but the hopelessness in her face held him there . He stayed , watching , for a long minute . Then he went forward. ( 105 ) " Mrs. Bryant , " he said quietly , and then had to repeat it . She looked at him as if he were standing at a far distance . " Can I help you ? " She came to life , but did not speak . " I 'm Bill Mathison . " She must be ill ; she should n't be wandering around these quiet dark streets by herself . She should be indoors instead of standing here , huddling into her coat , freezing to death . " Let me take you home , " he said in German . He touched her arm . She came with him , unresisting . Her pace was slow , unsteady . " First , please walk with me . A little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen minutes or so . He kept silent , too , letting her choose their direction . She was n't ill , he had now decided ; she was arguing something inside her own mind . Something highly emotional , painful . Perhaps there had been a quarrel , he guessed , when her husband returned ; and she had left the house to walk the streets and fight out the rest of the quarrel by herself . I 'll see her safely home , thought Mathison , and then retreat . This is n't my affair . Did n't I have enough of this kind of heartbreak of my own ten years ago ? " Thank you , " she said at last , drawing her arm away from his , increasing her pace to normal . " I needed help , and you gave me it . Strange to walk through a town I love , among people I know , and yet feel so lost . Strange , too  --  " She broke off , remembering . That was the way she had first seen Dick . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been almost the same , too : May I help you ? . . . That was so long ago . Twenty years . . . " Have you ever been in Vienna , Mr. Mathison ? " " No . " " Yates was there . " And what has Yates got to do with this aimless walk through Salzburg ? Mathison looked at her worriedly . " Do n't you think we should start getting you home ? " They had reached the riverbank by ' this time , and the Neugasse was well behind them . " That 's where I 'm going . That 's where I shall stay . Not with friends . Johann was wrong about that , but I let him take me to their house because he must find out what happened . I have to know . Do n't you see ? " She looked at him pleadingly . " And I have to find out about Yates . I must know if I can really trust him . Or else everything has been quite useless , it has all been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewilderment . " Look , " he began awkwardly , " I 'm afraid I do n't know what  --  " " You do know Yates . What kind of man is he ? " " I 've met him three  --  no , four times . Once in New York , twice on previous visits to Zurich , and then last week very briefly . 1 le 's a friendly type , free and easy  --  " " Be honest with me . Please . I have to know . " " If you are worried about that contract , Mrs. Bryant  --  " " It is n't the contract , " she said sharply , angrily . " It 's much more , much more than that . Dick said  --  " She almost broke down . She looked away , stared at the river alongside them . " He said that if things went wrong , I was to go to Yates . Yates would finish what he had begun . " She shook her head helplessly , kept looking away . " I do n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been trying to think , trying to put all the little pieces together . And I ca n't find an answer . No one in Salzburg can help me . Johann ca n't help me . You are the only person who could  --  perhaps  --  I thought  --  " She did n't finish . They had been walking along the continuous stretch of quays that edged the river 's bank , separated from the traffic in the street by a line of trees . Mathison halted , took her arm , turned around to retrace their steps . The moon had risen ; the stars were out . " I 'm taking you home , " he said quietly . His guess had been wrong about any quarrel there , so wrong that he resisted making any more . " It 's time you had something to eat . That 's what everyone else is doing . " There were few people out of doors now . Then his eyes narrowed as he caught sight of a man , strolling some distance behind them , who had quickly veered toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mathison wondered . Why the hell should I be followed any-way ? She was saying , " Dick trusted him . He is with British Intelligence . But now  --  " " British Intelligence ? " His thoughts swung away from the man who was now crossing the well-lighted street to reach its busier side of shops and restaurants . Clearly seen for that moment , he was the same man who had nearly collided with Mathison in the bar as he had turned to get his camera . Same man , same gray coat . " Eric Yates ? " " You did n't know ? " ( 106 ) ( 107 ) " How could I ? " He almost laughed , but her face was too tense . " Men who work in Intelligence do n't usually go around talking about it . " " He did n't . But Dick knew . He worked with Yates in Vienna . Long ago . At the end of the war . " An Intelligence agent as Newhart and Morris 's European representative ? That would send Jimmy Newhart 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yates could have come out , could n't he ? " " Dick said he was the kind of man who could n't live without intrigue . It was his natural career . And it was he who came to see Dick in Salzburg last spring . Dick asked him what he was doing now . He said he was with the old firm . Ile said that quite definitely . Then I left the room and I do n't know what else he said . But afterward , Dick seemed quite sure . That 's why he went to see Yates in Zurich  --  " She hit her lip . " Whatever made you imagine that I knew about Yates ? " thought there might he some -- sonic way you could find out  --  whether he really is what he says he is . Your friends in Washingtonmight have  --  oh , well , they might know about him . " Her blue eyes , honest , perfectly serious , looked at him frankly. " lint I 've no connection with Washington . " " None ? " She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johann said  --  " She stopped , struggled with her disappointment . " Even Felix thought so . " " Thought I was some kind of American agent ? " " Yes , " she said faintly . " Now what could give them that idea ? " he asked slowly , trying to puzzle it out . He was back in the shop again , talking about Yates and a contract . And looking at photographs . " Do they know Yates is a British agent ? " " No . " " They are just suspicious of anyone who came asking about your husband today ? " Or who looked at photographs so intently ? She had n't answered . He tried again . " What made you believe I might be an agent ? " he asked gently . " You seemed so interested in  --  in the same kind of thing as Eric(108)Yates . " Her footsteps quickened . " We arc nearly home . 1 ' 11 have to go in by the kitchen door ; that 's the way Johann and I left . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please forget all I 've said . I 've been so stupid . " Not stupid , he thought . Distracted and pressed to death with worries . Where was her husband , anyway ? If she had him to talk to , she could have poured all her misgivings about Yates into his ear . Then suddenly he realized that she had done nothing but talk of her husband in the past tense . He said , he did , he trusted , he knew . If things went wrong , Yates would finish what he had begun . " Will your brother be at home now ? " Mathison asked . He had n't the courage to ask about her husband . " No . " " There will be no one ? " " I want to be by myself . " " What about the friends you were supposed to stay with ? " " They think I am asleep . They gave me pills , but I did n't swallowthem . I waited until dusk . Then I ran away . I had to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had to go home . " She touched his arm , lightly , briefly . " Do n't be so anxious . I am all right now . The time for weeping is over . I have been calm , have n't I ? " But a very strange calm , he thought , and his alarm increased . " I wish I could have helped you about Yates and  --  " " Forget all that . Please . Do n't talk about him to anyone . It could be dangerous for you . " " I ca n't quite forget all about it , Mrs. Bryant . After all , Newhart and Morris would want to know . In fact , they ought to know . " She thought over that . " I suppose so , " she said slowly . " Yet  --  " " They wo n't want any publicity , I assure you . They 'll keep very quiet about this matter . But they must deal with Yates , do n't you see ? He ca n't go on doing their business with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . " And reaching exactly where ? Newhart would certainly need some pretty close accounting rendered to him . Then thinking of Newhart 's strong reactions , Mathison unexpectedly remembered the time he had served on a presidential advisory committee dealing with the conflicts betweeo scientific publications and classified information . That had been(109)four years ago , but James Newhart must still know some classified people in Washington . " Perhaps I can help you after all . I have a friend who may have contacts in Washington who might know what questions to ask in London . That 's where you really have to go to find out about Yates , is n't it ? " He did n't altogether believe his own words ; he was just handing out hope , that was all . She needed it . But she did n't seize on his words , as if she were beginning to realize how impossible it would be to discover anything in Yates 's world of silence . If , Mathison emended that , Yates was actually an agent . All these charges might be hart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be blamed and hated , labeled responsible . She frowned . Slowly she said , " I do n't really trust him . And yet , to whom else can I go ? I must find out what he really is . I must . " " Why do n't you trust him ? " " There never was any contract for the book . Was there ? " She had a point there . " I do n't know , " he admitted frankly . " But I 'll find out . That I can promise you . " She seemed to have lost interest . Or perhaps she only wanted to get home now . They were at the beginning of the Neugasse . Its shops were closed ; lights were dim behind shuttered and curtained windows of the rooms overhead . There were few people walking through this little street at this hour . Not even the two men were to be seen , the men who had worn such complete ( and new ) Salzburg costumes and had patrolled so dutifully . They 've been called off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacements either . " Thank you , " she was saying , " you 've come far enough , Mr. Mathison . " " Bill is shorter . " She tried to smile . " So is Anna . Good-bye . " " Not yet . How do we reach your back door ? I 'm seeing you safely inside . Come on now . " She led him along the Neugasse , passing the closed and darkened shop with its handsome display of camera equipment , stopped im- mediately beyond it at a large wooden door . It was the entrance to several apartments , he noted , glimpsing a neat list of names posted at one side : a lawyer , a dentist , a doctor of letters , and three fami- lies without titles or degrees , including Richard Bryant . He swung open the heavy door and stood hesitating on the threshold . They were entering some kind of hall , possibly oblong  --  for the street ( 110 ) lighting only spread a few feet over the flagstone floor  --  and certainlycold and dark . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna said . " Just a moment . " She took a step into the deeper shadows in search of the switch . The darkness seemed to give her courage . She faced him . In a tight low voice , she said , " They killed him . It was no accident . The Nazis killed him . " " Nazis ? " " Yes . As surely as they killed those two men at Lake ' I'ohlitz . " Good God , he thought , she is n't rational at all . She probably never has been . She 's  --  He felt her grasp tight on his arm . " Now , " he said as calmly as he could , trying to disengage her hand gone rigid as if it were trying to make him believe , " we 'll get you inside your apartment . " And I 'll call a doctor , he thought . " Where 's that light switch ? " Her hand went limp , left his arm . He heard the flick of the switch , but the hall remained dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . The hall stayed dark . " Its fuse must have blown , " she said . Her voice was now as normal as her words . " Do n't worry . I can find my way upstairs even in the darkness . " He had found a matchbox , almost opened it , then remembered it was the one that held his Minox film , jammed it safely back into his pocket , began searching for the spare box he carried with him . " Please do n't worry . The stairs are just beyond our kitchen doorthat'sthe back entrance to our shop , actually . We have the apartmentabove  --  " Her voice broke off . We ? She moved quickly toward the staircase that led to emptiness , her hand guiding her along the plastered wall . The match flared and died . Mathison took two strides into the hall as he struck another . There was a loud crash as he knocked against some heavy object and sent it clattering over on its side . He held the match high , rubbing his knee with the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of five large garbage cans standing neatly together with a sixth rolling backward and forward on the stone floor . Thank God Salzburg was a clean place ; the cans ' lids were all firmly chained down to defeat rats and roaches , and nothing had spilled . " No harm done , " he said cheerfully . Except for a bruised knee and a burned finger where the match had burned too low . He dropped it , set the garbage can back in place. ( 111 ) " Sh ! " Anna whispered . He struck another match and saw her pointing to the kitchen door . " Someone 's inside ! The light 's on ! " Mathison reached her quickly . And as the match flickered out with his burst of speed , he could see a narrow line of light edging the bottom of the door . " Your brother must have come back . " Thank heaven for that , he thought . " Johann is in Unterwald . " She found the key in her pocket at last , but she was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took her hand away , turned the key in the lock , pushed the door open . There was a receding clatter of heels , the sound of someone in flight . " Stay here ! " he told her as he entered the kitchen . He headed at full speed for a long hallway that must lead to the shop itself . It was from there that he could now hear the lightly running footsteps . He heard , too , a sharp crash , then the scrape of a bolt being pulled aside , the opening and closing of the front door . He had to slow his pace as he went through the dark shop , avoided a stool that had been knocked over to block his way , pulled the street door open , spilled onto the narrow sidewalk . Nothing in sight . But he thought he heard the same running footsteps , and he set out after them . I lc turned the corner , only to see a pair of legs and the swing of a coat disappearing into another street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his speed , but by the time he had reached it she had vanished . Ile slowed his run to a walk , if only because there were other people in sight now . This street was broader , busier . And filled with doors ; doors and entrances and small courtyards and narrow throughways to other streets . The woman had vanished . Quickly , he retraced his steps . At the corner of the Neugasse , he saw the man in the gray coat trying to look part of a shadowed doorway . Mathison went up to him . " l ) id you see her ? " he demanded . The man looked at him nervously , tried to walk off . Mathisoncaught a gray lapel . " You could have seen her . Did you ? " The man struck out wildly , wrenched free . As a sprinter , he was almost as good as the woman . Mathison did n't even try to chase him . Too many doors , alleys , winding streets . Any stranger was handicapped from the start . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . And why(112)had he looked so startled , so amazed , even before Mathison had spoken to him ? Had he recognized her ? . . . That was a double failure , Mathison thought angrily : I should have kept a grip on that lapel , even if I had torn it off . He found Anna Bryant waiting in the shop . She had set hack the stool in its place by the counter , turned on the light . She was standing in front of the wall that had held the display of Austrian lakes , staring at it in disbelief . He stared , too . The photographs had gone . All of them . He said nothing , closed the front door , securely bolted it , followedAnna into the narrow hallway . She stopped at the entrance to a small interior room that had been partitioned off from the kitchen . It was a photographer 's darkroom , he noticed , as she turned on its light , a neat businesslike place with sink and water faucets and worktable and trays . A drying cord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelving , with rows of large filing boxes . They were clearly labeled Duplicate Prints . She went to one of them , examined the folders inside . Then she turned to a metal box on another shelf and looked through its envelopes . " The negativeshave gone , too , " she said quietly . " Both the duplicate set of the lake photographs and their negatives . " She passed him quickly at the doorway and entered the kitchen . It was in complete disorder . At first he thought the thief had rummaged wildly , and then he noticed the unwashed dishes , the littered table with its unfinished meal , the pots on a small electric stove filled with food now cold . It would have been a marvel if any prowler had found anything here at all . Anna was standing in front of a small desk , more orderly than any other piece of furniture in this kitchen  --  living room except that one drawer was open . The thief must have been at work there when the fallen garbage can had sounded its warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna 's key was in the lock and make sure it was n't a false alarm , some visitor for an upstairs apartment . " Anything missing ? " She nodded . " The envelope marked Yates ; the one you saw today . Everything that could connect Yates with Dick is gone . " " Or perhaps it is the other way around . " She closed her eyes , put her hands to her mouth. ( 113 ) " Come on , " he said , taking her arm and leading her over to a comfortable armchair beside the big ceramic stove , six feet high , free-standing in a corner near the window . " But who could have wanted to know all about  --  " She had been talking half to herself . She did n't finish her spoken thoughts but looked up at him , puzzled , fearful . She shivered , folded her arms tightly around her . " Who would they be ? " He had disbelieved her before , had thought she was irrational , ill . Now he knew she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might even have told him some real facts . " Nazis ? " he ventured , if only to show her he was now willing to believe her . He still had the feeling he had stepped back twentyoddyears into another world . " How do I get this going ? " He eyed the stove mistrustfully , risked opening its curved door just enough to see what lay inside . Glowing embers , dying slowly . There was enough life . He looked around for the fuel this huge monster of decorated tiles , handsome enough in its baroque bulges , must gobbleup . He could see no logs . " Not the Nazis . Not this time . " She spoke in a strangely flat , hard voice . " They do not need to find out any more about my hushand . They have already taken action . " Their way . " He found a coal scuttle on the other side of the stove . " No wood ? " he asked , looking down at the heap of soot-black bricks under a heavy glove . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They arc safer . " He dropped only two on the embers so as not to smother them , left the door slightly open for increased draft , and hoped that would start warming the room again . Shc had shivered twice . Peoplewere always cold after shock . " Herr , " he said , taking a heavy jacket from its peg on the door , " put this around your shoulders . " The jacket seemed to comfort her . She said slowly , " That was a woman who came here . Was n't it 's " He nodded . " A young woman . Shc moved fast . She knew her way around those streets . " 1 fe looked at the cluttered kitchen and then at the opened drawer . " She knew her way around here , too . She knew just what she wanted . " Anna looked at him blankly . " And now there 's nothing  --  nothing to show . " " I took some photographs . Remember ? I 'll send you copies of(114)the letters  --  " He stopped . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lake photographs that really appalled her . " I 'm sorry , really sorry . It would have been a remarkable book . " But again his words meant little to her . " I promised him I 'd never go near the lake . I was only to show  --  " She bit her lip cruelly . " All for nothing , it was all for nothing . " She began to weep , silently . He moved over to the desk , found a small directory , brought the book over to her . " Anna  --  please . What 's the name of your friend ? The one you were staying with . She will be worried about you . Please , Anna . " " Dietrich . Frieda and Werner Dietrich . " She stared at him , suspicionrising . " But I wo n't leave here . I wo n't ! " She quieted her voice . " I should never have left , " she said dully . He found the number , and then had to search for the telephone  --  it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclamations for half a minute , eventually persuaded her to come around here and spend the night . He would wait until she arrived . He replaced the directory and , as he did so , he stooped to pick up a small scrap of paper that must have fluttered out of the book as he opened it . It was a telephone number , hastily written . It was n't Bryant 's writing , though . Anna was watching him . She was in control again . The tears had stopped . " That is Yates 's number  --  the one Dick was to telephone when he got back here . " He frowned at the number . Only one thing was clear : it was n't the number of the Zurich office ; it was n't Yates 's home number either . " May I copy this down ? And I 'll note your telephone number , too . " He remembered that all Newhart and Morris addresses had gone with the stolen file , so he wrote them out for her as a kind of reassurance . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised . " Do n't worry . We wo n't forget you . This is n't the end of this matter . " She stared across the room at the gaping drawer . " Perhaps Yates is responsible for that , too . He wants to take all the credit . He will give Dick none of it . None . He knows where to search . Now he has the photograph , the one that was n't sent to him  --  it was n't to be published . It was just a  --  " She broke off . " It wo n't matter now . He has everything . " She rose . " I think I 'll go upstairs . I 'm very tired . " She looked at the small lines of flame running around the edges of(115)the briquettes on their bed of glowing embers . " Thank you , " she said . " I ' 11 need a warm stove in the morning . " She added some more fuel , closed the door of the stove , adjusted a ventilator . She is far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practical voice . If what she has been saying seems wild , then it is only because I know so damned little about anything . " I 'll see you into the apartment upstairs , lock you in , and give Mrs. Dietrich the key . " The apartment seemed safe enough . No intruders here . And she was so exhausted , both emotionally and physically , that she might not even notice its emptiness . There would be bad days ahead for her , he thought , as he returned downstairs through the dark hall . He had to wait almost ten minutes before Frieda Dietrich appeared . She was , he noted with relief , a placid blonde with a capable air and a kindly face . " I 'll soon get this place straightened up , " she told him , and he could believe her . " Anna was never much of a housekeeper . Poor Anna ! A terrible thing , terrible ! " " What happened actually ? " " His car went off a hill road near Unterwald . " " Unterwald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of here . Just beyond Bad Aussee . That 's where Johann Kronsteiner has his ski shop . He 's Anna 's brother . Lucky she has him around . There 's no one else . Of course , there 's a niece in America , but she was adopted in Vienna by an American and his wife . An army officer in the American occupation forces . That was years ago , soon after the war . The niece was only a baby then , wo n't even remember her . You know what it 's like with adoptions : people do n't want the family to keep in touch . It 's understandable , I suppose . Too had that Anna never had any children of her own . Never could understand it . She 's young , too . Only thirty-five . He was much older ; she depended on him for everything . It 's a terrible thing . Terrible . " Yes , Mathison agreed , it was a terrible thing . He backed away . " Well , now that you are here to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , Frau Dietrich . I hope everything will be all right . " He looked around for his camera . He had dropped it somewhere in his chase through the house . " Here it is , " he said , picking it up from the floor . " Good night . And lock this door after me , will you ? " ( 116 ) " We do n't lock our doors  --  " " Do it to please me , " he said with a grin . Ile left quickly , seeing all the amiable questions that were rising in her curious face . Let Anna deal with them , he thought . I 'm just the innocent passer-by . He headed back for the hotel . The evening was shot to pieces . He would have dinner in his room and work at his brief for Newhart , getting everything down as quickly as possible while his memory of the details was fresh . He would have it ready by the time Newhart telephoned at midnight . As he turned the corner into the busy street , he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which one the woman had used to vanish behind . She was young , all right . A girl . And the stockings on her slender legs had been light in color , very light . Flat-heeled shoes . No one could have run like that in high heels . And a swinging tweed coat , a neutralcolor from the distance . . . That reminded him to look over his shoulder for a man in a gray raincoat , but he could see no signs of anyone following him . That was one thing about losing your temperand losing it hard : it could discourage the other fellow . In the hotel lobby there was a large decorative map of Salzburg and the surrounding country that brightened up one wall for the benefit of the tourists . Mathison studied it as he waited for the elevator . Southeast of here , just beyond Bad Aussee . . . Yes , almostdirectly east of Bad Aussee was Unterwald , so unimportant that it had been given only the smallest printing . It was near a lake , a little blue oblong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains . There was spider type , delicate , almost unreadable , stretching up the side of the narrow lake . He resisted the impulse to tip his head to read it more easily , just as he had kept his finger from tracing the road from Bad Aussee . With difficulty , he read the name sideways . Finstersee . Yes , definitely Finstersee . He turned away from the map , looking now at the selections of dirndls and lederhosen inside the display cases , showing  --  he hoped  --  more interest in them than he had done in the map . At last he could step into the elevator and reach his room . The first thing he did was to take his camera case from the wardrobeand open the Minox . The decoy roll of film was gone . Ridiculous , he had told himself this afternoon , when he had inserted it ; all that trouble possibly for nothing . Yes , that was what he had thought then . But now ? ( 117 ) He fished in his jacket pocket , brought out the matchbox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box in his trouser pocket  --  keep close my pet , keep close  --  took off his jacket , loosened his tie . He went over to the head of his bed and picked up the telephone . A double Scotch ; sandwiches ; a typewriter , with carbon paper ; three separate orders , with a repeat added to the Scotch to see him through the evening . No real dinner or wine tonight , he decided regretfully : he could n't afford to feel expansive and pleasantly lethargicon the job that he faced . And it was going to be quite something , to boil down events and words and facts into a straight brisk summary . Nothing longer than three pages for the completed brief , including the footnotes . Jimmy Newhart liked his reading crisp and clear . He flopped onto the comfortable bed to wait for the drinks , lit a cigarette , stared at the ceiling . Now let 's begin at the beginning , he thought . First , you noticed two men as you entered the shop early this afternoon -- hey , what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shop and met Anna Bryant . . . . Ile felt like a man who was walking across a stream of whirls and eddies , managing not too badly , and then , all at once , had stepped into the steep drop of a deep pool and was up to his chin in rushing water . Ile pushed away the typewriter at a quarter to twelve , studied the pages of his preliminary notes , and tore them into small pieces once he made sure he had left nothing out of the final concentrated report . There were two copies : one to carry with him , the other to mail at the airport as he left Salzburg tomorrow . lie was taking no chances . Ile read the report once more ( with its appendage dealing with his own experiences that had made him take Mrs. Bryant 's informationseriously ) . The gist of it made clear that there were two separate problems for Newhart and Morris . First , there was a dubiouscontract and a peculiar check signed by some Emil Burch . Secondly , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so deeply involved in both problems , Newhart and Morris had been placed in a difficult if not doubtful situation . In one case , they stood to lose some money even if Mrs. Bryant didn't(118)sue ; there was a question of good faith involved here , or rather , the canceling of their employee 's bad faith . In the other , it seemed as if their chief representative in Europe might be a British agent using their name as cover for his activities . And that , thought Mathison as he burned the discarded scraps of paper one by one in the large ashtray , that is the joker in the pack . It had taken Newhart years to build up his firm ( Morris had retired handsomely a couple of years ago ) , and now he might sec its reputation and good will dissipated within a few weeks . If the newspapersstarted playing around with Yates 's name  --  He did n't finish the thought . Even sly gossip , whispered rumors could be as dangerousas headlines . The Swiss , for example : how long would they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a center of espionage activities ? There was only one consolation in the whole bloody mess . The British , presumably , were n't working against American national interests . At least , they were supposed to be on the same side of the fence . But he would n't describe the placing of one of their agents inside a perfectly innocuous American firm as exactly a friendly gesture . It was time to get prepared for Newhart 's call . He rose to bring the telephone over to the armchair near the window . The view was as spectacular at night as it had been by day , and at last he would have time to enjoy it while he stretched his back in a comfortable seat and propped his feet up . The architects and stonemasons who had built this town would have been astounded to see what effects electricity could bring to their work . The careful floodlighting had added another dimension . Maybe we ca n't build like them , he thought , as he remembered the tall glass boxes and slabs of metal cheese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to use light . That would n't inspire any future poets , though ; there would be few twentieth-century remains worth eulogizing once the barbariansdestroyed the power plants . He was halted abruptly by the telephone cord . It jerked him to a standstill at the foot of the bed . At first he thought it was tangled and could n't make its full stretch to the armchair . But it was straight and taut . He sat down on the edge of the bed and broke into laughter . They really had been after his telephone , right from the start . They ? He sobered up and looked at the neat black instrument in his hand . Latest model with microphone in place ? He would need(119)a screw driver to investigate . Perhaps a nail file might substitute . Before he could try , the telephone rang . Careful what you say , he told himself . But how was he to keep Jimmy Newhart in check ? Jimmy not only raised his voice when he made a call , he got the most wordage out of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Newhart 's call was his shortest on record . " Look , Bill , will you get back here right away ? Yes , right away . When can I expect you ? . . . Sure , I know you 'll have to juggle flights and connections . ' Fry to get here by tomorrow night . Call me from Kennedy Airport , and 1 ' 11 let you know where and when to meet . . . . Cut out ' liirich meanwhile . Just get here . " There was a deep sigh . " Boy , you 've given me one hell of a day . " And on that note of gloom , the booming voice cut off . So ' Zurich was canceled . Meanwhile  --  whatever that meant . And there were two good suits and six of his best shirts waiting for him in his hotel room there . He searched for Elissa Lang 's address in the Salzburg directory , but it was n't listed . It was just possible , though , that the farewell party was still lingering over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called the porter downstairs , who was a knowledgeable character , and enlisted his help in tracking down Schloss Fuschl . It was on a nearby lake , the porter told him . A little late , perhaps , to telephone but he knew the night porter there . Would Herr Mathisonlike him to handle the call ? It came through in a few minutes . No , he was assured most earnestly , there had been no party of six people from Salzburg tonight . No party of any size whatsoever . Not tonight . Definitely . He put the telephone back on its table and went over to the armchair . He looked at the castle across the river , towering over everything . This afternoon , he had been followed the way up there . Then suddenly no one was following him . And later he was followed again . Meaning ? Nonsense , he told himself angrily . The first man could have kept well out of sight once he saw Elissa speak to me . There were enough walls and battlements rising around that castle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were completely absorbed in each other . And it did n't have to be a lie about Schloss Fuschl. ( 120 ) Her friends could have changed their minds and taken her someplaceelse . He called the hall porter once more and began discussing flights out of Salzburg tomorrow morning . That brought him hack to his own world , and he stopped thinking of people whom he might never see again anyway . In that mood , he stubbed out his last cigaretteangrily and went to bed . But there was one postscript to be added to his day in Salzburg . It occurred early next morning , when he had arrived at the airport and joined a small group of people at the reservation desk . Ahead of him were two men . They had dropped the fancy dress and now wore stiff-looking business suits , but they were the same two who had maintained a dogged vigil yesterday afternoon outside Bryant 's place on the Neugasse . They were trying , in a mixture of very exact German ( for the benefit of the Austrian clerk ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in quick discussion between themselves ) , to extend return tickets from Prague into the longer trip to Warsaw . That should be done at Vienna when they changed planes , the clerk kept repeating . But they were worried about connections and time , and so they argued for a useless two minutes . As they walked off in sullen annoyance , each carrying one small suitcase , the clerk had the last word . He shook his head sadly and said to his next customer , " They think they know everything , these Czechs . " ( 121 ) With the help of the five hours ' time lag between Central Europe and Eastern daylight-saving America , Bill Mathison arrived at the Newhart and Morris offices just as the staff was pouring out of the elevators to catch the evening trains and buses home . But on the eighteenth floor , where Jimmy Newhart had his suite , his secretary was waiting in the outside office . The three typewriters near its door were shrouded in gray plastic covers , their desks empty of papers , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen this place so quiet . It looks like the morgue . Are you working late ? " " I 'm the hat-check girl tonight . I also keep cleaning women at bay . " She took his coat and camera , picked up the hat he had thrown on a chair , and with her foot pushed his bag more closely against the wall where he had dropped it . She was in one of her brisk moods . He had never seen her quite so serious either . " Had a bad day ? " She turned her eyes helplessly to the ceiling . So he did n't waste any time on even one joke , but headed straight for Newhart 's office . It was empty . He kept on going , to reach the inner room . Newhart was standing at its wide window , looking down at the street below him . " A fine mess , " Newhart said , turning away from the giant excavation in the block opposite . " And that goes for Zurich , too . " Ile was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pugnacious face usually softened by an(122)easy smile , and an excellent taste in clothes . His manner was capablebut quiet , with occasional bursts of machine-gun energy . Tonight , he seemed strangely subdued . To begin with , at least . " Good to see you , Bill . Glad you got here so promptly . We 're having a couple of visitors . Thought I 'd brief you before they came . Well , how are you , how are you ? " He shook Mathison 's hand with a good hard grip , offered him the most comfortable leather armchair , and poured him a stiff Scotch . " I expect you need this , " he said , but that was all the time he seemingly had for talk about the difficultjourney . " Here 's my report , " Mathison said , pulling it from the safety of an inside pocket . " And here 's this . " He produced the matchbox . " Fine , fine . " Newhart took them and laid them on his desk . Mathison had to laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's room , sitting back in a slight state of euphoriaas he watched Jimmy open the envelope and start reading eagerly . Instead , he was watching Newhart pull a folded sheet of newspaper out of his drawer , smooth it neatly as he began talking across his desk . " As soon as you finished your call yesterday morning , I spoke with the manager of the Maritime 's Forty-third Street branch . The minute I asked about someone called Emil Burch who had an account with him , I could almost see him freeze . He gave me a very polite but completely stave-off answer . Said he would call me back with available information if any . But within half an hour I had two quiet and efficient types from the FBI sitting in front of me . " He nodded with approval as he noticed that Mathison had stopped lounging and was bolt upright in his armchair . " Yes , that 's exactly how I felt . " " They are interested in Emil Burch ? " " They 've been searching for him for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Swiss ? What have they to do with Burch ? " " Burch also banks in Zurich . " " And just what is our government 's interest ? " Newhart glanced at his watch . " I 'll let them tell you about that . Yesterday , they were polite but cryptic . This morning , they paid a second call and were more informative . Enough , anyway , to scare the daylights out of me . Thank heaven they seemed friendly , though . I would n't like to face them if I had a bad conscience . " ( 123 ) " And they are coming back tonight ? " Mathison did n't hide his amazement . " To talk with you . The name of Emil Burch triggered them off . " " And who is he actually ? " That was something Mathison had been wondering about for the last twenty-eight hours , ever since he stood in Bryant 's shop and stared down at a check . Newhart 's voice dropped instinctively . " It seems he acts as a paymaster for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazement changed to incredulity . " They 're putting you on , Jimmy . " " You just wait and see about that . In the meantime , have a look at this article  --  it was published about two weeks ago . " He consultedthe ( late heading a page torn from the New York Times . " Yes , Sunday , September 1 H " I le handed it over . Mathison recognised it . He had read the article with astonishmentand a touch of vague disquiet  --  just the kind of combination that helped fix any news item in his memory . He looked again atthe headline . URANIUM LOSSES SPUR DRIVE EoR TIGHTER U.S. CONTRr ) i . OF I IStiIC ) NAnI.I MATERIALS . " I can almost quote you the firstparagraph , " he told Newhart . " The Atomic  --  ergy Commission discovered that one of its industrial contractors had lost more than 100 kilograms of highly enriched uranium enough to fabricate six atomic bombs . ' Yes , I remember it . I also remember hoping pretty gloomily that someone , for Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Someone is , " Newhart reassured him . " I know that we can expect a small loss of one or even two per cent in most manufacturingprocesses using enriched uranium . But this stuff was U-235  --  highly enriched  --  absolutely essential for nuclear weapons . That 's the shocker . It seems we have been hitting a new high in carelessness . We are just too damned casual about such things  --  it is n't as if U-235 grew on trees or could he smelled like iron . " And Newhart was oft , into one of his newest interests . ( Ile was publishing a book next spring called The Nuclear Balance of Power . ) Mathison lit a cigarette , listened intently as he smoked it slowly . The plants needed to produce highly enriched uranium were enormouslyintricate , occupied vast space , demanded fabulous investments . And , at first , success could not always be guaranteed . The process was exceedingly difficult ; for instance , one part of it con-(124)sisted of four thousand filtering stages . So it could be possible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short cut by procuring U-235 illegally . " We just do n't have enough safeguards at present against unlawfuldiversion of highly enriched uranium , " Newhart ended his account , " and that 's the reason why there have had to be investigationsin the last few months . Any losses , even if caused only by bloody stupidity , need careful checking . " Mathison stubbed out his cigarette thoughtfully . " But what has all that got to do with Emil Burch ? " " Apparently  --  " Newhart began , and stopped as a buzzer sounded at his elbow . " They 're here . " He consulted his watch again . " And right on the button . " He rose and went to meet the two men who had entered the room . One was about forty , of middle height , and thin . His face was pale , and tired , as if he had n't had much sleep recently . He was introduced as Frank O'Donnell . The other was John Lamberti , closer to thirty , fairly tall , broad-shouldered , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatly and quietly dressed , with manners to match . They gave Mathison a polite but definite look as they shook hands , refused a drink , and seated themselves where they could see his face . O'Donnell wasted no time . " I understand you made a copy of the Burch check that was sent to Salzburg , Mr. Mathison . " " I photographed a photograph , to be exact . " " More than once ? " O'Donnell sounded hopeful , but he looked prepared for disappointment . " Four times to make sure , " Mathison answered with a grin . " You have those photographs with you ? " " In that matchbox . " Mathison pointed to the desk . Newhart laughed . " Bill , you slay me . You do enter into the spirit of things . " " I 'm glad I did . My hotel room was searched and my Minox emptied of a substitute roll of film I had left in it . " Newhart said , as O'Donnell 's eyebrows lifted , " You never told me that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of things happened later . You 'll have to read my report after all , Jimmy . " Mathison watched Newhart 's face with some amusement as he picked up the envelope. ( 125 ) O'Donnell spoke quickly . " Apart from the check , is there anything else about Emil Burch in your report ? " " No . " " Would you mind if we got your film developed right away ? " " HIe 's the boss , " Mathison said , nodding to Newhart . " It 's his lawsuit . " " You 're not serious , Bill . " Newhart was aghast , forgetting his worries about unlawful diversion of fissionable material and returning to the more everyday problems of settlements and costs . " Let 's say we are lucky that Mrs. Bryant is n't the kind of woman who sues . " " Mr. Newhart , " O'Donnell asked patiently , " may we develop those films ? The process will take only fifteen minutes or less , even to enlarge them . We 'll have prints made tomorrow , but I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be deN eloped by better experts , " Newhart said . Mathison nodded his agreement , only worrying now that he might have used too much light ( or too little ) or moved when he was taking the pictures . If they did n't come out well , he 'd have no one to blame except himself. l , aniberti was already over at the desk , lifting the matchbox , opening it carefully . He relaxed when he saw the tissue wrapped around the film . " Did you get that clear sample of Eric Yates 's signature , Mr. Newhart ? " Newhart produced a letter from his drawer , and , along with the matchbox , it went into Lamberti 's pocket . " I ' 11 phone you the minutewe get them scanned , " he told O'Donnell , and headed for the door . " Mr. Lamberti , " Mathison called after him , " would it be possible to have an extra batch of all the prints ? Bryant 's file on Yates was stolen yesterday evening . I promised Mrs. Bryant I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lamberti looked interested , but he nodded and left without asking any questions . O'Donnell 's eyebrows had gone up a further fraction of an inch . " Stolen ? " Newhart asked . " What the hell has been happening , Bill ? " " Read the report , " Mathison said inexorably . " It took me almost four hours slaving over a typewriter last night , ruined my dinner , ( 126 ) spoiled my sleep . You do n't want me to go all through that again , do you ? " Newhart drew out the three double-spaced pages from their envelope . " Nothing there about Burch or missing U-235 , " Mathison told O'Donnell , who was allowing some amusement to show in his quiet gray eyes . " Just how important is this Emil Burch ? Where does he tie in ? " O'Donnell looked as if he wished those questions had n't arisen . He glanced toward the report  --  Newhart was now reading it with obvious concern  --  and seemed to measure a reasonable quid pro quo . " Anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mathison , " is completely confidential . " " Of course . So is that report , by the way . There may be nothing about Burch in it , but there 's a good deal about Yates . " " That sounds interesting , " O'Donnell said politely . If he was eager to read the report , he was managing to disguise it fairly well . " There must be some close connection between Burch and Yates  --  " " We do n't know that yet . First we 'll have to study the Burch signature on the check that Yates sent to Bryant . And then we have to compare it with Yates 's own signature . " " Did n't you have Burch 's signature for his First Maritime accountto compare with one of Yates 's letters in the Newhart and Morris files ? " O'Donnell nodded . " Burch 's writing is upright and very exact . Yates 's signature slopes forward and ends in a scrawl . We comparedthem yesterday and could find no link between them . " " What difference do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never expect . We just hope . A faked signature sometimes varies . It depends on whether the writer is using the correct pen for his forgery , or whether he is rushed , or paying less attention . " " You do n't sound too optimistic . " " I 'm not pessimistic either . A faked signature is a tricky business . Even Burch  --  or Yates  --  could make a split second 's mis-take . " All very interesting , thought Mathison , but it 's getting me nowhere . He tried again . " I 'd really like to hear anything you can tell me about Burch . After all , I do represent Newhart and Morris. ( 127 ) Anything detrimental concerning Yates is going to involve them in a great deal of unpleasantness . Now let 's stop being a couple of lawyers , " he said and won an answering smile . " I did hear in Salzburgthat Yates is a British agent . Is Burch employed by the British , too ? " That really jolted O'Donnell . " A British agent ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the report and seemed in no mood to rush his reading of it . " That 's something new , " he admitted wryly . " Emil Burch is certainly engaged in espionage , but I do n't think he is in the employ of the British . " He studied Mathison quite openly for a few seconds . " I suppose you are going back to Zi rich ? " " That 's possible . " " It might be eery useful if you did . " To whom ? wondered Mathison . " It might also be dangerous if I did n't know something about 13urch . " What exact business , for instance , did Yates have with Richard Bryant in Salzburg ? Anything to do with Yates 's possible connection with Burch 's activities in the United States ? " And I 'm not talking just about myself . I could endangeryour investigations if I am not properly briefed . You agree ? " Again there was a hint of friendly amusement in O'Donnell 's eyes . " You press hard , Mr. Mathison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste . " O'Donnell obviously agreed with that . " All right , " he said . He considered briefly . Then his voice became crisp , matter-of-fact , to suit his words . " We have been investigating a problem dealing with the security of the United States . As often happens in that kind of general probe , we cane upon something unexpected . A man , quite above suspicion , was seemingly nervous about the repeated visits our agents paid to the plant where he held a sensitive post . Either he assumed they must know more about him than they actually did or his conscience started to bother him . Anyway , he approached us . Eventually , he made a full statement , admitted he had been recruited quite recently to supply information about the date of certain deliveries at his plant . He had only agreed to supply it , because it appeared harmless enough . And he needed the money . His first payment , however , had alarmed him ; it seemed more than his information justified . Ile had n't yet spent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars in fifty new hills . We tracked their serial numbers to the hank that had received them  --  the First Maritime at Forty-third . A teller remembered one client who always requested used twenty-dollar bills . " New bills stick together , " he said . But three weeks ago , old twenties were scarce , so he had to take a thousand dollars in new bills . He was annoyed . The check was drawn on the account of an Emil Burch . " It could be a case of industrial espionage , " Mathison tried . " The methods used were too intricate for that . " O'Donnell hesitated . He was thinking of the information that had been attached to the inside of a magazine and passed at the busy counter of a New York drugstore to a contact known only as " Tony . " The payment , in turn , had been left at a " drop "  --  in this case , the space under a loose rock near a certain bridge in the park of the informant 's home town . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the park was fairly deserted , was to walk his dog . ) " Tony " had arranged both assignations , using cryptic phone calls and excessive care in establishing contact . ( He had n't turned up for the first drugstore rendezvous ; probably stayed in the background to watch the informant'sbehavior . That night , he had telephoned , arranging the same place and time for a meeting one week later . ) He had set another meeting after the first was at last completed safely , but by that time the informant had confessed and two special agents were also there as interested observers . " Tony " was now being watched , all his contacts noted . It would take time before his network was fully discovered , but " Tony " himself had been traced . ( That would have distressed him considerably . When he had left the Communist party eight years ago under orders to go underground , he had made the usual moves : all open contacts ended ; records destroyed ; a change of address from the West Coast to the Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two years ago , he had gone even deeper underground  --  and away from his old comrades completely  --  ina shift farther to the left . Again there was a change of name , address , place of occupation . He had concealed his moves well enough ; to most people nowadays he seemed more bourgeois than his new set of unsuspecting bourgeois friends . ) O'Donnell shook his head over the deviousness of the political animal 's mind . " I think , " he said quietly , " we can rule out any case of industrial espionage . " ( 129 ) But Mathison had n't finished the problem of Burch . " He had a bank account in Zurich , too . Right ? Which is his main place of business ? " " Zurich . How did you know he banked there ? " Mathison nodded in the direction of Newhart , who was now rereadingthe last page . O'Donnell was almost amused . " You have one of those retentive memories , have you ? " 1 'd do well to remember that , he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mathison said pointedly . " So what about Burch ? How does he make his money ? " " He is a dealer in fine books , manuscripts , ancient maps . He has his main office in Zurich , and opened up a branch office in New York two years ago . That was when he set up his New York accountwith the First Maritime . " " It must be an incorporated business . " That made the opening of any foreigner 's account in an American bank a fairly simple process . " All he needed was a recommendation from his Swiss bank that he was solvent and a good risk . " " He is certainly that . Money keeps coming steadily from Switzerland , enough to cover even the large withdrawals here . No complaintsfrom New York at all . " " Could n't Swiss Security give you any help ? " " They did what they could . All they could tell us was that Emil Burch 's account in his Zurich bank is also in excellent condition . It gets its money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ouch ! " Swiss numbered accounts never had any information divulged about them . A matter of Swiss law . " So you 'll never know who owns that numbered account or what is behind it . " " All we do know is that Burch 's Zurich bank account is being used as a channel to other accounts abroad . " " It seems to me that Swiss Security might become interested in Mr. Burch himself . " " Give them time . He is an elusive man . Travels a great deal , leaves the running of his Zurich business to its manager . " " Searching for tine hooks , manuscripts ? " " And ancient maps . " This time , they both shook their heads . Mathison had several more questions , but there was n't any use in asking them . He had(130)been given more than a fair share of answers as it was . He looked at the tired , haggard face sitting opposite him . There was one big question remaining , though . He risked it . " Why are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Because the British do n't need what Burch is looking for . " " Meaning highly enriched uranium ? " " Now who brought that up ? " O'Donnell asked blandly . The British had their own supply of U-235 , thought Mathison . So had the Russians , although they were n't telling anything to anyone . The French were now producing the necessary minimum after at least one disastrously expensive mistake . Mathison sat very still . He glanced over at Newhart. . . . any country racing to produce nuclear weapons might search for a short cut . . . illegally . . . unlawful diversion . . . " You worry me , " he said softly . Newhart looked up , gathering the three sheets of paper together . " You worry me , " he said grimly , as he handed the report to O'Donnell . O'Donnell was a quick reader . He seemed only to glance down the first page . On the second , he went back over the last paragraph , the one that dealt in detail with the constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The third page  --  with emphasis on Finstersee and the parallel of Lake Toplitz given by Anna Bryant in talking of her husband 's death near Unterwaldtightenedhis lips . " I 'd like to study this . Have you another copy ? " " It was mailed from the Salzburg airport this morning . By the way , you can add a postscript about that . The two men who watched Bryant 's house had come from Prague , but they were leavingfor Warsaw . They were speaking Czech . " O'Donnell took a pen out of his pocket and actually noted the postscript in the margin . " All this goes farther than we are allowed to reach , but someone should certainly look into it . This Nazi angle , for instance  --  we ca n't afford to neglect that . " He folded the report and replaced it slowly in its envelope . His brow was furrowed , his eyes thoughtful . " May I take this with me ? I 'll have it back in your hands by tomorrow night . " Newhart nodded . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked quickly . O'Donnell looked surprised and then amused , but he answered(131)frankly . " Two , if you have no objections . One for our classified files ; one to pass along to the Agency . Europe is their business . " " The fewer copies the better . " " I agree . " O'Donnell was frowning . " You know , Mr. Mathison  --  there are certain aspects of that surveillance in Salzburg which puzzle me a little . You were followed up to the castle ; and then nothing ? Not until you got down into the town again ? " " That 's right . I thought about it , too . The only reason I could find was  --  well , I probably was under surveillance all the time , but I was n't paying so much attention to it when l was up at the castle . " He met O'Donnell 's quick look with a smile . " I was with a girl . " " Oh . . . An old friend ' ? " " No . I met her up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . " " I 'm sorry I 'm so stupid , " O'Donnell apologized in his quiet , earnest way , " hut I do n't quite have the picture . She was a stran-ger ? " " Yes , " Mathison said curtly . Then , if only to show it had been a pleasantly innocent meeting with a charming girl , he explained Elissa Lang . " Originally , Eliza-something-or-other . But she has n't used that in years , " he ended . " From Chicago , you said ? " O'Donnell asked mildly . " Forgive me if I ask one last question : are you meeting her in Zurich ? I believe you mentioned something about her going there to visit her grandmother . " " Well , there was a tentative arrangement . But I doubt if I 'll have time now to think of anything except Yates and his blasted files . " " Yes , " Newhart broke in . " I 've been wondering if he has used , our name for any other bogus contract to establish confidence . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? Play the poor sucker along and get a first claim on his information ? " O'Donnell nodded , but his thoughts were elsewhere . " Do you mind ? " he asked Mathison as he took out his pen and jotted down Elissa or Eliza-something Lang on the flap of the envelope . " Sorry to have bothered you about this . But it is necessary for us to get as complete a picture as possible . " That was a delicate reminder that without a mention of the brief episode with Elissa , Mathison 's report could be considered incomplete . Either , thought Mathison with rising annoyance , I turn in a(132)full record of my day in Salzburg or I should n't have submitted any report at all . Which was true enough , he admitted slowly . " I did n't think it was important , " he said gruffly . " It possibly is n't . " O'Donnell pocketed his pen , ending that subject . " I must congratulate you on your report . It is really very ex-pert . " " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference in our approach , " Mathison said , recovering some of his good temper . Elissa was n't important , he felt sure of that . The professionalhad only given himself another footnote to check . This one would be a waste of time and taxpayers ' money , but that was O'Donnell 's headache . If he wanted to clutter up his recordsThe telephone rang . O'Donnell was on his feet , picking up the receiver before it began its second ring . He listened without interruptions . At the end of the call , he said , " That 's fine , John . How long will it take you to get prints made ? Enlarged as far as possible . . . Yes , the whole film , a complete job . I 'll pick them up . I have to take a late flight to Washington . See you . " He replaced the receiver slowly , his mind now several thousand miles away . " Well ? " asked Newhart impatiently . " It is possible that Yates and Burch are the same man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face drained of color . " We need definite identification from the experts . But what the photograph shows is extremely interesting . Burch 's signature on his check to Richard Bryant is less exactly written , more fluid . Three letters show a close resemblance to the same three letters in Eric Yates 's own signature . That may not sound like much , but to the expert in handwriting it can mean a great deal . " " He must have been hurried , " Newhart said , " or under some tension . " " Or contemptuous ? " Mathison asked . " He was signing a check for a man he had duped . " O'Donnell looked at him , then nodded . " Good-bye , " he told both of them , and shook hands warmly . " Thank you for your help . It has saved weeks of searching . " Weeks ? he thought . It might have taken months to uncover Yates . Perhaps never , if " Burch " decided to cut his losses and fake his own death ; those boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do then was keep quiet , sit tight , play the innocent publisher . The Swiss(133)would n't even have known that further search was necessary . He said to Mathison , " The Swiss may very well get in touch with you when you are in Zurich . You 'd have no objections ? " " Would I be allowed to have any ? " Mathison asked in wry amusement . But he could see O'Donnell 's point . Now that he knew about Burch , his searches through the Zurich office files might producesomething he had passed over last week . Or even Yates 's elderlysecretary , so tight-mouthed when it came to questions about her employer  --  for Yates had the power of hiring and firing his office staf  --  might unbend considerably once Yates was dismissed from his job . " Switzerland is the host country , " O'Donnell reminded him with an unexpected grin . That was something he was obviously never allowed to forget . " You 'll hear from us , " he promised Newhart , and closed the door quietly. " 1 hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will we hear ? " He had recovered his normal color , hut he was obviously brooding about Yates . Ile sat down heavily at his desk . " You know what , Bill ? I think I 'll spend tomorrow in Washington , too . I just want to make sure that --  " " I 'd leave it to that guy . There 's no good in getting our wires all crossed . Besides , the fewer people who know about Yates , the less chance there is of broken security . " " My friends in Washington know when to keep their lips but-toned . " " Sure . But even discreet enquiries can start some speculation . You do n't want publicity any more than the hBI does . Let them handle Washington . " " Well , I 'd like you to get back to Zurich right away . " " I ley -- -give me a night 's sleep at least ! And a day to sharpen my wits . At the moment , all I can see is a long hot shower and a comfortablebed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I had dinner several hours ago . " And he wanted no more discussionuntil he had got some thinking done . There was too much at stake here , and not just for the firm of Newhart and Morris , to be blown off in a fine cloud of talk . " Bill  --  how much do you trust Anna Bryant ? Oh , I could see from your report that you found her sympathetic . But trust is an-(134)other matter . After all , it 's only her word . And she was in a highly emotional state  --  must have been . " " Are you talking about the contract ? " " No . It 's her statement about those god-damned Nails . " Newharthad served in the European theater in World War 11 , all the way from Normandy to Berlin . " You were only a kid at school , but I saw the liberation of one concentration camp , and I tell you- - " He checked himself . " Okay , okay , I 'll tell you another time . Better go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . And Bill  - -  thanks . I mean that . " Mathison left the small room , its photographs of family and friends beaming from every wall , crossed over the yards and yards of soft gray carpet in the outer office with its hunting prints and mahogany and copper lamps , entered Linda 's preserve with its equally soft carpet ( Audubon prints here , in dark-green frames ) , and found her knitting a thick-stitched sweater . She seemed to have worked some of her gloom away , for she looked up with her usual bright smile . But this time , it was he who was preoccupied . Tactfully , she said nothing . " Oh , I nearly forgot , " he said , almost at the door , putting down his bag and searching in his pocket . He brought out the letter that Bryant had sent to Newhart two weeks ago , the letter that had been the start of everything . He stood looking at it , remembering Anna Bryant 's face as she had identified that letter . " I 'll take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and folded up her knitting . " Good night , Mr. Mathison . " " Good night , " he said , still several thousand miles away . One small letter , he was thinking as he went into the long corridor , one polite but businesslike letter packing a charge of dynamite . Finstersee . . . What was so important about Finstersee that a man would risk his life ? ( 135 ) 10Wednesday was a day of waiting , and most of Thursday . Bill Mathisonhad to use considerable restraint not to telephone Jimmy Newhartwith questions about O'Donnell : what have you heard , what 's going on , what has he run into in Washington  --  deaf ears , bland smiles , gentle reassurances ? Newhart 's patience was certainly under similar strain . The idea of Yates , back in Zurich from his German trip , quietly at work in his office  --  in Newhart and Morris'soffice- was enough to boil Jimmy 's temper into an explosion as high as Krakatoa . Mathison made a protocol call to his own office down on Wall Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the senior partners ( Newhart and Morris business unfinished ; this quick visit back to New York merely a matter of consultation ) . But apart from a couple of brisk walks in the crisp autumn air , and a lonely dinner at his usual steak house on Third Avenue ( no good making a date with Peggy or Nan and having to break it ) , he spent the rest of his time in his own apartment . He had often wished for a couple of days to himself in the middle of the week ; now , he had got them and he could n't enjoy them . His small apartment was comfortable  --  it faced south , so that the sun streamed cheerfully in  --  and the white walls of the living room were covered with teak bookshelves in a broken-rhythm patternat its sitting end . What was more , the shelves were n't cluttered with bibelots and cute bottles but actually contained books , some(136)rather battered , for he had been gathering them together ever since he was in college , yet these old friends were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile after pile of records onto the stereo : Bach , Ravel , Haydn , Prokofiev , Mozart , Sibelius , Vivaldi , Shostakovich , Verdi , Fischer-Dieskau singing Sclutinann , Callas trying Norma ( not her best effort ; he 'd have to find another recording ) , Schonberg , Bach again , and Bach . At least they kept him good company while his mind circled around the closely packed events in Salzburg . He had the odd , unpleasant feeling of being poised above his own life . Everything had come to a stop , and he was waiting . It was like the day after his final exams , or his inductioninto the army , or his interview for a job with Strong , Muller , Nicolson and Hodge . Just waiting , wondering , wishing , wanting , all wrapped up in a package of not-knowing . The hell of it was , as he told himself several times on Thursday morning , he sensed something was going on in Washington . He even conjured up momentarily a small bare ugly room with three serious men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the threatened bust-up of NATO , so engrossed were they in  --  guess what ?  --  three pages of William Mathison 's typing . ( That at least gave him a loud laugh , although that sounded damn silly , too , in the lonely apartment . ) By two o'clock on Thursday , he had finished his gourmet luncheonof slightly burned omelette , overmelted Brie , chilled Sancerre ( at least that was a success ) and left the cluttered mini-kitchen for Mrs. Pyokari to clean in her morning visit . He got his feet up on his favorite black-leather sofa , opened the book he was reading  --  a new novel about a British Intelligence network working in Berlin where the hero was his own best enemy , everyone was tired and old and cynical , all so meaningless , mess without end Amen Amen , The telephone rang . And it was Newhart . Jimmy wasted no time . " Yates is missing . " " Yates ? " " Just had a call from that secretary of his . Miss  --  " " Freytag . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get back to Zurich on Tuesday night , did n't appear at the office yesterday morning or today . His housekeeper says he has n't been home since a brief visit on Saturday . " When he was supposed to be in Germany , thought Mathison . It(137)gave him a strange feeling to realize that when he had been working late in the empty Zurich office on Saturday , Eric Yates had been prowling through the town . " What else did you learn ? " " What else ? Bill , it took me ten minutes to get all that out of Miss Freytag . The woman 's practically hysterical . Scared stiff . " Old self-contained precise Miss Freytag ? " I 'd better leave for Zurich and take charge of his desk and papers . And when he gets back , I suppose I question him about the contract as a sort of lead-in to a telephone call with you ? Or do you want to come over yourself ? " " That would emphasize everything , do n't you think ? We 'll play it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you while you call me . Right ? " " Anything in particular that you want me to say to him ? " " Use your own judgment . You 're in charge , Bill . Just get this business cleaned up . " Newhart dropped his voice to a normal tone . " Our quiet friend of the other evening is worried in case Yates has left for a long vacation . " So Frank O'Donnell was on the job . That was good news at least . " A permanent one , perhaps ? " " Could be . That Saturday-night visit to his house was to collect his passport . " Mathison restrained himself from asking which one ; Newhart was in no mood for jokes at the moment . " I low did our quiet friend find that out ? " " Swiss Security has been busy . " " I 'm glad to hear someone has . What about our quiet friend him-self ? " " He has just left on a long trip . Sent you his best . By the way , about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men I recommended will be over to fix it this afternoon . Sorry I took so long to get hold of them , but they 're quick . They wo n't delay you . " " I hope they know their business , " Mathison said , recovering from his surprise . " I have a couple of imperative questions . " " They 're fully qualified . Do n't worry about that . Now two more things : I 'm sending Mrs. Conway to Zurich  --  she 's head of our translation department and a bit of a linguist . She lost her husband some years ago , by the way . She 's a capable girl . She can manage(138)the office there until I find a replacement for Yates . That 's going to take some doing , I tell you . " Better luck next time , thought Mathison , and again restrained himself . Newhart went on , " She knows something about the situation . I told her about that funny business with Bryant 's contract . If you have to expand on that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremelydiscreet . " That , thought Mathison gloomily , means she is past her first youth and has given up hope . " It might be simpler if you would send a man . " " Arnold is in Houston , Bernstein 's wife is in the hospital , Johnstoneis seeing an author through labor pains  --  complete revision of galley proofs or we 'll have a turkey on our hands  --  and Paradinc is on jury duty . Besides , none of them knows both French and German . Like to be a publisher ? " " Hardly worth the wall-to-wall carpeting . Hey  --  I nearly forgot . Did you get the prints of the photographs I took ? " " You 'll have them this afternoon . I think  --  perhaps  --  you might even deliver them personally in Salzburg . " " Is n't that stretching the expense account ? " Mathison asked with some amusement . " Yes , but it may be cheaper in the long run . At least , that 's what I am beginning to think . What 's your opinion ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act for you . You 've always stood by any commitments he made . The fact that you never imagined he would make this kind of commitment is not much of a defense in a law court . " " Then it is possibly wise that you see Mrs. Bryant , explain per-sonally . " " I think that 's the least we could do . She is as much an injured party as you are . If she were less honest , you could have some kind of lawsuit faked up against you . " " Better get some signed clearance from Mrs. Bryant , do n't you think ? " " That 's necessary . And I 'd suggest a token payment on that kind of quitclaim . What about the equivalent of the original advance  --  three hundred dollars ? " " So you think a copy of the contract might turn up ? " ( 139 )
