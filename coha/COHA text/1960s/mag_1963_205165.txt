Several weeks ago . White House legislative aides began sounding out Senators about a hush-hush plan to pack Harry F. Byrd 's Senate Finance Committee . The notion was to increase the committee 's membership by adding two Democratic liberals , thereby enhancing the prospects for both the Administration 's tax revision and medicare plans . <P> The first probings proved promising , so Democratic Majority Leader Mike Mansfield quietly spread the word that he would seek a favorable vote in the Democratic steering committee , which makes committee assignments . At this point , Byrd , who steadfastly opposes medicare and the Kennedy tax program , let conservative Senators know that he considered the packing plan a personal affront . One of his calls went to his good friend Richard Russell of Georgia , who predictably viewed the plan as an outright assault upon the traditions of the Senate and upon his Southern colleague . On such issues , Russell can usually deliver the entire Southern conservative vote . Nearly all of the Republican Senators could be expected to oppose the plan . <P> Last week the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee was to meet . Majority Whip Hubert Humphrey got a call from White House Aide Larry O'Brien . The fight had been called off , O'Brien said . Humphrey and other Senate liberals went ahead anyway , and lost in the steering committee by a vote of 10 to 5.
