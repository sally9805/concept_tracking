President Kennedy looked across the flat land toward the Missouri River , its waters imprisoned behind the world 's largest rolled earth dam ( Oahe : 242 ft. high , 9,300 ft. long ) . Behind the river rose the brown buttes of South Dakota 's cattle country . The President opened his speech to some 9,000 persons with a deeply heartfelt cliche : " I want to express my great pleasure and tell you what a privilege it is to leave Washington these days and come out here . " Kennedy had every reason to enjoy being away from Washington : the Democratic Congress was still giving him fits , and the U.S. space lag was apparent . <P> Thus it was a relief for Kennedy to take off on what White House staffers , with straight faces , called a " nonpolitical " weekend trip . In speeches in South Dakota , Colorado and California , he stuck mainly to bipartisan subjects of interest in the West : conservation and reclamation , water and power , floods and dams . But he well knew that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handshake - and that the folks beaming up at him would suffer no amnesia on election day . <P> Powerhouse Performance . In small Pierre , S. Dak. ( pop . 10,500 ) , Kennedy paid his respects to welcoming officials-then broke for the airport fence to shake at least 200 hands among some 2,500 people pressing to see him . He was in South Dakota , ostensibly , to help dedicate a new 595,000-kw . Oahe Dam powerhouse . But the real reason for his presence was right at Kennedy 's elbow : Democrat George McGovern , South Dakota Congressman from 1957 to 1961 , Kennedy 's Food for Peace director until last month , now a candidate for the U.S. Senate . McGovern , running neck and neck with Republican Incumbent Joe Henry Bottum ( who is filling the vacancy created by the death of Republican Francis Case ) , greeted Kennedy at the airport , rode beside him in an open convertible to the dam , sat on the speech platform . <P> On the presidential plane , as Kennedy flew into Pueblo , Colo. , for a speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fryingpan and Roaring Fork rivers on the western slopes of the Rockies into the Arkansas River valley on the east , was Colorado 's Democratic Senator John Carroll . A loyal Kennedy backer in Congress , Carroll faces a stiff re-election challenge this year from Republican Representative Peter Dominick . It was Carroll who introduced Kennedy to some 8,000 cheering spectators in the Pueblo High School Stadium . <P> Sharing the Plunger . The most conspicuous greeter , as Kennedy arrived at California 's Castle Air Force Base , was Democratic Governor Pat Brown , who needs all the help he can get from all the Kennedys he can lure West in his re-election fight against Richard Nixon . Aft er an overnight stay in Yosemite Luis water project in the San Joaquin Valley - a vital link in Brown 's plan to meet the multiplying water needs of Southern California . <P> Brown sat beside Kennedy during the ceremonies , made a speech of his own , shared a twin plunger with the President to set off the dynamite and send red , green and purple smoke over the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe all Californians will long remember the water leadership of Pat Brown . " Greater tribute no politician could hope for .
