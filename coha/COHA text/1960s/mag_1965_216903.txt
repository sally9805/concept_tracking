At the Tel Aviv office of Israel 's Chief Rabbi Isser Unterman , twelve black-coated rabbis solemnly recited their afternoon prayers and then sold several thousand acres of Israeli farm land to a smiling Arab sheik in return for his promissory note for 500,000 Israeli pounds . In exchange for a deposit of $17 down , the rabbis handed over legal ownership of the property to Abdullah Abu Kishek , then toasted the transaction with soda pop . <P> Madness ? Millennium ? <P> Neither . The deed of sale is a ritual that the rabbis carry out every seventh year on behalf of Orthodox Jewish farmers who intend to observe Shemittah , the sabbatical " year of release " that began last week on Rosh Hashanah . During the year , according to the Law , all land owned by Jews in Palestine must lie fallow. * That way lies bankruptcy ; so Jews have resorted to the legal maneuver of giving full title to their property to a non-Jew , who is not bound by the Halakah . This enables the Jews to work the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three assessors representing the rabbinate will meet the sheik and hand him a revised bill of sale purportedly representing the true value of the land-which would be several million pounds more than he bargained for . Sheik Abdullah will do his part gracefully . He will protest his inability to pay , demand his release from the bargain , and return the deeds of ownership . The rabbinate will then give him back his $17 , and the Israelis once again will own their land . <P> Under a Canopy . Shemittah , so Orthodox Jews believe , is a commandment from the Lord , although Biblical critics believe that the custom originated as a primitive means of crop rotation . " For six years you shall sow your land and gather in its yield , " God ordered Moses in Exodus . " But the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow . " Normally , Israel 's substantial minority of Orthodox Jews transfer their property through the chief rabbinate to an accommodating Arab . Because of pressure from religious parties , the Israeli government ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duration of Shemittah . During the sabbatical year , Abdullah thus will be legal owner of more than 1,000,000 acres of Israel soil . <P> Some Jews have found more ingenious solutions . One Orthodox kibbutz near Tel Aviv turns to hydroponic farming during Shemittah : seeds are planted in 90-ft. - long gravel-filled concrete plots , where they are chemically treated until the year is out . Although the method is expensive , the plants grow bigger than they do in ordinary soil . Another farm grows its crops in chemically-treated straw . Less scrupulous kibbutzim get around the prohibition against planting during Shemittah by covering their tractors with canopies ; according to one tortuous rabbinical interpretation , planting is legal if it is done inside an enclosure . Horrified by all such agonized evasions of Shemittah-and by the growing number of Jews who do not observe the sabbatical year at all-some of the devout prefer to buy their fruits and vegetables from Arab farmers or do without altogether .
