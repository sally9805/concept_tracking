For the past four months , the British national press has been undergoing the most severe crisis of self-confidence in its history . First , an outsider-Canada 's Lord Thomson-took over the London Times , symbol of Fleet Street stability . Then Harold Wilson 's economic squeeze caused a drastic cutback in advertising . Finally , last week , a report confirmed the newspapers ' worst fears : the industry is in dire trouble . <P> The papers were swallowing their own medicine ; they commissioned the report themselves . Begun a year ago by a subsidiary of the London Economist , the analysis was supposed to have been quietly circulated among the sponsoring publishers and unions . But the Guardian , which was not a party to the agreement , got a copy of the report and leaked salient portions . The leak forced the publishers to release the entire 555-page report . It is now the talk of Fleet Street-much to its own discomfort . For the report lays the lion 's share of the blame for the industry 's decline on a " small number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " little interest in modern management methods and techniques , yet retain almost absolute authority over their organization . " <P> Habit of Succumbing . Partly as a result of this old-fashioned management , said the report , four of the 18 nationally circulated newspapers are likely to close down by 1970 . Only two-Lord Thomson 's Sunday Times and Cecil King 's Daily Mirror-can face the future with any kind of confidence . From 1957 to 1964 , newspaper profits rose 29% , while editorial costs jumped 98% and production wages soared 130% . During this period , only seven papers succeeded in increasing their revenues more than their costs . Average circulation fell 6% , which was an indication that the rise in population is not enough to offset the " decreasing interest in buying newspapers . " <P> The papers , noted the report , are overstaffed by some 4,000 men , many of whom do little to earn their pay . The cost to the industry of this featherbedding : a debilitating $13.6 million a year . Despite the waste , continued the report , management has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions . Instead , it makes a habit of " succumbing to extreme pressure . " Sometimes it even succumbs in ad vance . It was long believed , for instance , that the Guardian was forced to print in both London and Manchester because of union insistence . In fact , the Guardian management never formally discussed with the unions the possibility of shutting down one of the printing plants . <P> After the report was released , some papers snappishly defended themselves , others owned up to the industry 's inadequacies . Various rescue plans were proposed , ranging from government subsidies for newspaper production facilities to a more equitable distribution of advertising among the papers . But there were no easy panaceas . Wrote the London Economist in a harsh indictment of the industry : " Britain 's national newspapers have got themselves into a mess and are pleading for sympathy . Most of them are so incompetently managed that they deserve nothing of the kind . "
