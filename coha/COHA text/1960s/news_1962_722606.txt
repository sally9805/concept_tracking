txt The City Council was urged yesterday to enact a law establishing a minimum wage of $1.25 an hour , to be increased in one year to $1.50 . The proposal was made in a report by the Citizens Commission on the City Economy . The commission was set up , by the Council in April to study and report on the impact on the city 's eoonomy of a min- , imum wage for employes in private industry and business here . Four members of the sevenman commission favored immediate establishment of the $1.25 minimum and the increase to $1.50 a year later . Two members , including Louis Broido , chairman of the commission , dissented . Fears for Economy Cited They said that they had been ' prepared to go along with the proposal for immediate enactment of a $1.25 minimum but felt that the proposed increase to $1.50 would seriously hurt the city 's economy . They contended it might drive some business from the city and probably cause some employes , for whose benefit a minimum wage was being sought , to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote . Eric J. Treulich , leader of the Council 's Democratic majority , said he hoped it would be possible for the Council to meet next Tuesday to consider , in the light of the report , any minimum wage bill Mayor Wagner might send to it on or before then . It was strongly indicated at City Hall that the Mayor 's bill would call for the immediate establishment of the $1.25 minimum hourly wage . Whether it would call for an increase to $1.50 in one year remained doubtful . It also remained doubtful // whether the Mayor would make the bM applicable to all hourly rated employes , without exception , As recommended in the majority report of the citizen 's commission . The Mayor has indicated on several occasions his belief that a $1.50 minimum should be established if it Is found that it will not hurt the economic welfare of business and industry in the city . He recently declared , however . that data , now available did not provide that assurance . The commission majority 's report declared that it had purposely omitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . City Supervision Urged Besides recommending the enactment of the $1.25 minimum and its increase to ; 1.50 a year later , the majority report recommended that a city agency be set up to supervise and enforce the enabling legislation . Ahother recommendation was that the city require all agencies and institutions benefiting directly or indirectly from city payments . to pay the minimum wage to their employes . In such cases , the report recommended , the city should " make such financial arrangements with these institutions as to compensate them for the appropriate increases in casts which are herewith involved . " The majority report declared that a ; 1.25 hourly wage would increase the pay of 180,000 workers in the city , while a raise to $1.50 would mean more pay for 500,000 employes . The four commission members who signed the majority report expressed confidence that the economic welfare of business and industry in the city would be enhanced , rather than injured , by the immediate establishment of the $1.25 rate . U. S. and State Laws Cited The majority report included a tabulation of effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Federal laws . Neither of those laws provides for a minimum hourly rate as high as ; 1.50 . To create in the city " an island of higher minimum wages than exist in surrounding counties of the state and in adjacent states , " the dissenters declared , would greatly aggravate the migration of business and industry from the city to Nassau or - Westchester Counties , or to Connecticut or New Jersey . The dissenters urged the Council to reject a rise to a $1.50 minimum within one year on the ground that it would increase economic stagnation in the city and lead to massive unemployment , especially among unskilled workers . Members of the commission who signed the majority report were Hector Bunker , vice president of Banco Popular de Puerto Rico ; Edward S. Lewis , executive director of the National Urban League of Greater New York ; David Livingston , president of District 65 , Retail , Wholesale and Department Store Union ; and John I.
