txt Here is the confession of a burglar . It is the incredible story of corruption and crime in a big city police force , told in the jargon of the streets by a man who was a part of it . The man is Richard Morrison , 23 , the burglar whose story exploded the city 's worst police scandal . It started with pizza and parking tickets . It ended with charges of , burglary by uniformed police , and allegations of extensive looting of business men who were paying taxes to be protected . Where Everything Began Here are excerpts of Morrison 's confession to t 11 e state 's attorney 's office : " I guess the place to start this story is when I was working for Wesley 's pizza at 1116 Bryn Mawr ay. , because to the best of my knowledge , that is where everything started with me and the police officers of the 40th Summerdale district . " Morrison said delivery . men for the pizza place had been having trouble parking their cars near the place during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after awhile the police had been giving out so many tickets that our boss had to take care of the situation by letting the police come in and eat free so they would n't give any more tickets out . Sergeant Gets Cut , " Of course , he did n't let them all.do it , just the ones that the sergeant of the dis ? trict detailed in that area or on that street and , of course , the Sergeant got his cut also . " I know because I sometimes took his food to him at the station . " Morrison related that at that time he was trying to go straight after his release from the B r cie w.e where he served a term for petty larceny . He was holding two jobs to get bills paid off . lie was planning to be married . " Well , anyways , getting back to , the police in the 90th district , I knew most of them because I lived in the district all of my life and there were a few I went to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was on the bad side of them . Meets Policeman " Everything was going along fine until one day when I was walking down Berwyn avenue from Broadway and this police off ice r , Frank Faraci , came out of the Berwyn Liquor store and said to me : " ' Well , if it is n't the little burglar Richie . ' " " I knew Frank from the pizza place and 1 seen he was a little loaded so I just said : Hi , Frank , how are things with you ? ' and he said : ' Well , they would be a little better if you would cut us guys in on some of your jobs . ' " He said : ' You know Al Karras and some of the other fellows and we 'll go along with the show . After all , he said , we like nice things , too . " Morrison said he stalled for a few months , especially on the request of Allan ' Brinn , another of the policemen , who wanted a set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chased by Police " I did n't know at the time what I was really letting myself in for , but after I told them I 'd see what I could do it seemed like everyone in 40 Summerdal.e was asking me to get them one thing or another . " Morrison went off one night , admittedly drunk , and tried le steal the golf clubs from a parked car in Evanston . Police chased him , fired at him , and later traced an abandoned car to him . He was arrested , indicted , and released in bond . " I figured as long as the clubs were for a cop . . . I would accept their offer and start doing burglaries with them so I could . get the money to beat the case . " So , from day to day I met the cops in a restaurant at 1 a. m. , and we set up jobs every night . From time to time I kept meeting more coppers , that were burglars , and from time to time I kept getting more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of money for lawyers , bondsmen , and cops , as the ones I went on jobs with sometimes let their friends at D-3 the north side detective division know that I did it , but they would n't let them know about themselves . Cost Quite a Bit " So , I had to pay guys in D-3 to forget about the case and it cost quite a bit , too . " You see , the cop that let them in on it got a nice cut of the money , too . I did n't find that out until after I was arrested July 30 , 1959 , and it was hard to believe that the same guys I went on burglaries with in the 40th district would also let their D-3 pals in on it so they could get a few more hundred out of the job . " Then Morrison recited to state 's attorney 's investigators the roll call of the eight uniformed burglars of the Summerdale district . The list of names was to lead to the investigation that finally made public the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some jobs , the police . men merely acted as lookouts for Morrison . Here is one example , involving the looting of a music store at Balmoral and Clark streets : " Frank Faraci heard the call , " Morrison said . " He said he heard the burglary in progress call giver out by the squad operator . He heard the call in the 40th district station . " He happened to hear this call and he happened to know it was me in the place . He shot down there in squad car 207 and blocked the street and he hit the window of . the place . " I had the money in my pocket when Frank came on the scene and hit the window with the spotlight . Blocks the Street " Frank Faraci blocked the street from the detective bureau car and the other car containing , two other police lookouts came around the alley . " I got over the fence and my car was parked down the street . So I took off . " Morrison said that in appreciation he later gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store , which amounted to several hundred dollars . In his confession , Morrison , who calls himself the city 's master burglar , told of the near-shooting of a North Shore Patrol watchman by some of the policemen . " This particular night they wanted to hit a food store . They all had crow bars with them . They had their own place picked out on Damen avenue and Bryn Mawr . . . . " Picks Another Store ' Morrison advised his accomplices , after looking the place over , that it was " no good . " He selected instead a store at 1112 Thorndale , ay . His story continues : " Anyways , there were five of these police officers and me . We all hopped into one squad car , 207 , with Frank . . . " Anyways , we were running around - in the store when we were getting this stuff . I happened to think , who was listening to the radio calls in the squad car ? I said I would . That burglary almost ended in death for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car and I was sitting there . They were coming out with bacon and hams , and everything you could think of in the store , real expensive foods . They ept filling the back seat of Iche squad car . " Flees in Squad Car Morrison said suddenly another auto pulled up behind the squad . In it was a sergeant of the North Shore patrol . " I figured if he sees me and - all this stuff in the squad everybody is dead . So I had to think fast . " Anyways , I took off in the squad car and when I came back they the policemen were still there . " They said : ' Where the hell you been ? ' They said : ' We almost had a heart attack ourselves . We had our guns on him . We all laid down low in the store . ' " The watchman checked a store next door , apparently never seeing the burglar-policemen . Otherwise he might have died . That was the night Morrison said , that his policeman friends offered to lend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them but he declined . " Too much trouble changing clothing , " he explained . Hidden Cash Missing Morrison w a s outraged when he learned that one policeman had investigated a burglary where some cash had been overlooked and , in his role as a policeman , bad learned where it was hidden . Armed with this information , he was told to return a second time , he said , but his police pal was fooled . The money was n't there .. " so , that 's how rotten these cops were , " said Morrison . " They did just anything to get a dollar . " Morrison had a sense of humor , no matter how weird . One night he and a civilian accomplice , Floyd Wilde , who also is in custody and a state witness , were ordered to break open a marine supply shop at Ardmore avenue and Broadway . Walks in Front Door The policemen were to come along , fire a few wild shots as tho k chasing them , and then loot the store themselves . Here according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked in the front door and they took their own outboards . I wanted to see how they did it . so we hid in the bushes and we seen them coming out with the big outboard motors . " I told Floyd . we 'd scare the hell out of them . We decided topedestrians. walk down the alley like " All of a sudden we saw them both stop . They both stopped with outboard motors in their arms . They said : ' Do n't move , somebody 's watching us . ' " So I busted out laughing and I said : ' You crazy jerks , it 's only us ' So they bawled us out for staying around there . They told us we scared the hell out of them . " Knew Too Much Morrison said he thinks some police member of the gang tried to kill him , possibly to rid the gang of the presence of a man who by then knew too much . So when he was told to go on a burglary to break into a meat market , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Explaining his caution , Morrison told interrogators : " ' Because I got shot up on Lawrence avenue in an insurance burglary and it was somebody in this clique . " Morrison 's police companion sat on his three wheeled motorcycle outside the meat market while Morrison . broke in . Morrison was unable to crack the safe , but took $1 , - 300 in other cash . Then he walked out to his companion . Hides on Roof " I told him that the door was open . You can round up the guys and bring them in . ' " I went down the alley and hid on a garage roof . He called in almost every available squad from the district . They had all the three wheelers , they had a paddy wagon , and three squad cars . " They all had their lights on and they were loading up those squads and everything . " Anyways , they cleaned out the whole meat market . . I was eating some of the steaks taken out of there at their houses quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were eating steak every night . They wore a ball with the steaks . ' Recalls Cop 's Trouble The policemen had their own troubles , Morrison related . He told of one'a trouble in the looting of the Self furniture store , 0320 Broadway . " He the policeman got this big marble ' table out of the front window and put it in the squad car and he drove it all the way up to his home in the middle of the night and woke his wife up . " She told me about it the following day . She said the bell rang and there he was with this big marble table . She had a fit . " The gang was planning to expand operations into the Rogers Park district , Morrison said . " I sort of went more for Rogers Park , " he said . " All these guys were doing anything for a dollar . They were greedy . They went for anything from automobiles parked in the streets to gumball machines . " The gang came close to being revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Involved was the burglary of a shoe store that was having . a fire sale on Devon avenue . The place was under guard by the Summerdale police . The gang took $14,000 worth of Shoes . " One of the policemen was drunk on this night and he went to a tavern to try and sell them , " Morrison added . " He was selling them for $2 a pair . He almost piled up his car that night . " We had to stop for the stoplight at Broadway and Brwn Mawr and he went right thru the red light and almost piled up in the drug store across the street . " He went up on the , sidewalk and down the street . Ile Was real drunk . " We were all talking about , ' it . That crazy so and so , if he gets stopped by ? the bureau , how is , he going . to I get out of it . He ca n't show his badge . ' Chewed Him Out " They all chewed him out for doing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling the shoes . He was a real nut . He was wild . He wanted to do anything for money . " These are some of the high spots in Morrison 's 77 pages confession . There are others . He also told how policemen selected loot for a sergeant in the station , how they " cased " stores , and drew interior diagrams for Morrison , and how they committed a host of other acts that have heaped shame on the police .
