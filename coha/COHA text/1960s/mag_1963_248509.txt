Still they come , all year round , to see the famed old man in his storied jungle setting . Public figures like Adlai Stevenson , starry-eyed U.S. Peace Corpsmen , spinster schoolteachers realizing a longstanding dream-all come for a visit to Dr. Albert Schweitzer . At his mission three miles upstream from the Gabonese village of Lambarn , " the great white doctor , " now 88 , affably greets them , autographing his books in a fine , steady hand . Yet , after devoting nearly two-thirds of his life ministering to the sick of equatorial Africa and being widely regarded as a near saint , Schweitzer is an anachronism in today 's Africa . After a journey to Lambarn , TIME Correspondent Jon Randal reported why : <P> Once , to see Schweitzer , travelers had to be paddled the 175 miles from Port-Gentil on the Atlantic . Now they arrive by air from the Gabonese capital of Libreville and put down at Lambarn 's modern airport , not far from a modern , antiseptic government hospital . On the short trip up the Ogoou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats powered by Evinrude outboards . Finally they reach Schweitzer 's hospital . Set ghostlike amid wild palms and tangled jungle undergrowth , its tin roofs and ramshackle wooden buildings are worthy of Rain or The Heart of Darkness . <P> Changeless Isolation . In the half-century since Schweitzer came to Lambarn with his wife Hlne and performed his first operation in a converted hen house , the mission has expanded but otherwise changed little . At the river landing there are only pirogues , crude dugout canoes , the one type of river ambulance Schweitzer will use . ( " Brancardier ! Brancardier ! " stretcher bearer the oarsmen cry when they arrive with an emergency . ) The hospital compound is without telephone , running water or refrigeration , has electricity only in the main building , which houses the tiny , antiquated operating theater . Sterilization is carried out in an outdoor lean-to and the only toilet is an outhouse for the use of the foreign staff . <P> With a capacity for some 400 patients , Schweitzer 's clinic is forever jammed . The sick , carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for hours to see the doctors , are bedded down on straw-mattress cots in dark , stench-ridden huts whose earth floors are awash during the rainy season . Outside , over open fires , the patients ' women relatives cook , while a horde of chickens , dogs and goats ( protected under Schweitzer 's " reverence for life " mystique by which no living thing should be unnecessarily disturbed ) roam at will , adding freely to the surrounding filth . When a patient dies and his body is unclaimed , it is wrapped in a fern-and-palm-leaf shroud , laid in a wooden box , and buried in the bush .
