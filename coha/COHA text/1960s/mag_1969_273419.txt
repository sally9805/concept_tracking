The old men have eyes like dirty ice and mouths as inviting as tombs . The young men have subdued ties , three-button suits and Ivy-covered vocabularies . Together they make up the modern Mafia that inspired " Lucky " Luciano , Murder Inc. and The Brotherhood . <P> No single film can tell the whole story of an organization as stark as Sicily and as Byzantine as the stock market . Instead , The Brotherhood concentrates on the microcosmic death struggles of a single Mafioso family . Frank Ginetta ( Kirk Douglas ) is the son of a deceased " soldier " of Murder Inc. days . Like his father , Frank still kills in the same old way , ordering a stool pigeon shot in a New Jersey dump , then stuffing his mouth with a symbolic canary . But Frank 's college-educated brother Vince ( Alex Cord ) has acquired new credit cards of identity . Not for him the violent memories , the long jags on vino , the crude labor racketeering . His work is the more up-to-date business of " washing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them through business firms that the mob has taken over . The new rulers have also learned to watch their Black Handiwork ; to them , the older brother is an embarrassing antique , to be brought up to date or kept out of sight . <P> When Frank avenges his father by garroting an old killer ( Luther Adler ) , the mob decides that he must die . Their choice of triggerman : Brother Vince . But for a soldier 's son there are no surprises . Lying low in Sicily , Frank realizes that his life really ended years before , when he refused to get out of the gutter and on to the sidewalk . All he can do is cloak himself in the traditional peasant armor : resignation . <P> $75 Hit . Working with Lewis John Carlino 's spare script , Director Martin Ritt has fashioned a film like grappa , with a raw kick and a bitter aftertaste . Seldom has a movie so resembled its characters . Like them , it has a primitive volatility , churning from glee to fury in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects of a legend that has outlived its time . Like them , it strains for respectability-and never makes it . For all its sober posture , the film is hooked on its participants . It stays too long at the graphic garroting ; it details too lovingly the good old days when a " hit " ( a decreed death ) cost a fast 75 bucks . It forgives the criminal because , though he is endemically corrupt , he is thoroughly dramatic . <P> The Brotherhood 's pervasive nostalgia grants the senior members the best scenes . As Frank 's wife , Irene Papas has a rare , abiding femininity that has taken on middle age and won . Luther Adler invests his role with the kind of craft and authority that make for supporting-actor awards . Douglas , fitted out in a push-broom mustache and dyed hair , is the most convincing , perhaps because the role of a prideful , aging bullock who clings to an old persona hits astonishingly close to home .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
