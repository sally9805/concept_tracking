 | It was at this time that Chiefeagle , the old and respected leader of the camp , called all of his band together . " My relations " , he began strongly , " this day my heart is very happy , even though I am a little sad ; sad because my lodge will lose a strong youth who has become very dear to me . This young brave has learned many things in the few short years of his life , things which most people of this land will never know . " His voice now becoming choked with emotion , the old man cleared his throat before continuing . " With wisdom and a noble purpose , he has taken a great road with a vow to follow it to the end . He has captured to his heart a fragile flower from the great white way ; a beautiful flower who will bring him much comfort and enchantment . " The pause was long , the people were quiet while waiting for the next word . " My voice can say no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of my people , I ask the Holy Mystery to give them the fortunes of happiness . " Slowly Chiefeagle turned and looking at the ground he walked to his lodge amid the thundering approval of the people . Regaining his composure , the old chief returned to announce that the feast was ready . The whole community then proceeded to devour great quantities of food , until they could hold no more . But still they summoned the servers and refilled their bowls and containers . This had been a generous feast , and what they could no longer consume they saved for later . The Sioux had known too many famines to think of wasting one morsel of food . It was no accident that not a scrap of food was left in the cooking pots . All through the supper the people were solicitous in their attention to the bride and groom . Turtleheart was greatly admired for his bravery and generosity and he was liked for his shy and sincere demeanor . All hearts were happy that this grandson of their respected leader , Chiefeagle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had become one of them . During the feast the bride and groom remained standing as decreed by custom . Evensigh 's light skin stood out in deep  | contrast with her blue-black hair . Unbraided , it plunged down around her oval face in a cascade of natural waves which seemed to flow with the gentle breeze . Her blue eyes were large and expressive , and the lips of her full and sensitive mouth were the color of the wild cherry blossoms . Evensigh 's vibrant natural beauty was accentuated by her clothing . Clad from shoulder to feet in white doeskin , replete with porcupine quillwork of the best Sioux workmanship on the moccasins , leggins and dress . Her proud and straight form was indeed a striking sight , with the waist as lean and slender as that of an active youth and her hips narrowed with the grace of many years of horsemanship . By now , the hollow tones of a drum could be heard . The young at heart are impatient , and even before the elders had finished their meal , several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremonial drum to the center of the camp circle and started to beat out the slow rhythm of the round dance . As the drum beat gathered strength , singers chimed in with a love song dedicated to the bride and groom . At the end of the chorus , all of the noise and singing abruptly stopped , except for a lone drummer who softly thumped the half beat of the first dance . Turtleheart arose with his bride , and with shy movements , put his left arm around Evensigh 's waist . Side by side , their entrance into the dance area was slow and stately . Right hands clasped together , and with hardly a glance at the surrounding , they danced in a two-step fashion . Once around the circle of spectators , the remaining drummers took up the beat with much enthusiasm . This was the awaited-for signal for the women to rise and ask the men of their choice to dance . Couple after couple fell into place behind the bride and groom , taking up the steps of the rabbit dance . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the beat . His shiny black hair was cut even with his shoulders , its tips brushing lightly on the muscles of his neck column . He wore a single spotted eagle feather on his head , its  | tip resting between the strands of hair . His medium height frame moved with the nimbleness of a deer , an indication of the athletic activities of his life . His copper red face was endowed with a masculine beauty and his eyes shone with proud dignity . As the dance ended , shouts and all manners of war whoops filled the air . Above them all , the camp crier 's voice intoned , " Take one last look at the lovers before they blend forever . " With the well wishers ' cries still ringing in their ears , Turtleheart and Evensigh melted into the darkness which was now enveloping the plains . The dance would continue till sunup , but the newly-married couple had a journey to make . Leaving the sounds of revelry behind them , they traveled into the night , and not until the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did they stop . They chose to begin their nuptials in the privacy of a narrow canyon which was strewn with tall pines and luxuriant grass . Here they laid down their blankets near a bubbling spring and stretched out to rest . Because of the inherent shyness of Indian youth , they would not look at each other , even though the desire to do so was strong . At long last , when what seemed to be the longest silence of their lives had elapsed , Turtleheart found the courage to speak . " Evensigh , " he murmured , " the strangest type of shyness is now strangling the outward expression of my heart . Soon may its wild beating stop . " " Oh Turtleheart , my loved one , my heart is also acting wildly . It is only for you that it beats this way . " Any further words by Evensigh were smothered by Turtleheart 's embrace . The silence had been broken and the shy fears of the man and wife had been conquered . The ensuing period of blissful seclusion was shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the western sky . According to legend , this was a favorable time for important undertakings , and the wedding had been carefully timed to coincide with the new moon . To disturb the bride and groom at this  | time meant banishment from the tribe , the ultimate penalty for any serious violation of tribal rules . The day waxed and waned over the earth , and there was a faint breeze coming up the canyon when Evensigh stirred . Waking , she opened her eyes to one of nature 's phenomena , a wondrous sunset which colored the earth with its red glow . For a time she lay half asleep , but still cognizant of the changing colors . Reality seemed so far away ; far , far away . It was only with some effort that she brought herself to the realization that she must gather firewood before darkness enveloped the canyon . Her mind was reluctant to accept this fact , because to awaken fully would be to break the spell of enchantment . The days passed quickly , and it was time to start the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouches at the spring , they were filled with remorse at having to leave this place of beauty . " Ne ye ! " Sioux ! Do as I say ! I have others with me , so do not try anything you will regret . " The tranquility of the past few days was suddenly shattered , and the harsh realization of trouble entered Turtleheart 's mind . " Back away from that woman . Lie down over by that dead tree . " Turtleheart had now recognized the dialect of a Santee Sioux , and his brain was whirling with the knowledge that the voice was not friendly . Dropping to one knee , Turtleheart glanced over his shoulder and realized the voice was speaking straight . Three white men emerged from the thicket of bushes on the edge of camp . He looked at Evensigh with eyes which seemed to say it would be useless to resist the command . To do so , would surely result in his death , and injury or worse to her . Evensigh was unable to take her eyes from the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart was racing wildly . Stories of these people who had white skin like hers raced through her mind and she was frightened . Her forearms and wrists dampened with fine perspiration . She  | could not understand the mutterings of the three white men as she watched them remove Turtleheart 's weapons . The Santee was standing to one side , watching her with hawk eyes that did not miss the beauty of the girl and the fineness of her clothing . Walking slowly toward her , he inquired , " Do you speak Sioux ? " She nodded , unable to speak , while watching Turtleheart 's face for any possible instruction . The Santee warrior turned his attention to Turtleheart . " My name is Thin Bird , and by what are you known ? " " I am known as Turtleheart , " the young Sioux replied in an even tone . " What is it you want ? " " We wanted your ponies . We need them to continue our journey . We do not wish to harm you or your woman , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us until we cross the Paha Sapa . If you made your way back to camp , you would bring others to pursue us . We are on our way to the place of the yellow metal beyond the Black Hills , as the white man calls them . " " That is the sacred ground of my people , the Tetonwan . Why do you take these men to this sacred area ? What kind of man are you , to be a traitor to your relatives ? " Turtleheart spat upon the ground . " Think of yourself ! You are the same color as we are , and you belong with us , not on the side of the white people whose hearts and tongues are against our people . " " Your tongue should not ask these questions , Turtleheart . " Thin Bird turned on his heel and motioned to the beardless white youth to accompany him to the horses . After this bitter exchange of words , none other passed the lips of either Turtleheart or Thin Bird . Instead , silent preparations were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved , ever wary of detection . Thin Bird very skillfully avoided the Indian camps which lay along the way . Always traveling in single file , Thin Bird  | was the leader , followed by Evensigh . The three white men came next and last was Turtleheart . This order of travel was the idea of Jim , the beardless one , since he realized that Turtleheart would not try to escape without Evensigh . He also knew the Indian would be the best man to prevent attack from the rear . Thin Bird informed Turtleheart that if they were attacked from the rear , the white men would take Evensigh 's life . With this in mind , Turtleheart took every precaution against any possible attack . Sometimes he rode into the occasional forests of trees to the side of their route , and sometimes he backtracked to conceal signs of their trail . He was always hopeful of being able to communicate with his people before they could attack , so he could formulate a plan of rescue . After bedding down each night , the beardless one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was the real leader of the group , despite his youth , and that Thin Bird was merely a scout for the party . Evensigh was always kept separated from Turtleheart , and her movements were always kept under close scrutiny . She was the insurance for safe passage through the Teton Sioux Country , and they all knew it . Not one spoken word was allowed between the young couple , and their only means of communication was with their eyes and an occasional silent hand signal . One night , after a hard day of travel through rough terrain , Turtleheart was looking at the stars through unseeing eyes . He was wondering how Evensigh could keep going at the cruel pace set by Thin Bird . Unaware of Thin Bird 's approach , lie was startled by the sound of the Santee 's voice . " Turtleheart , it is hard on your woman to be traveling as we have . It will soon be over . We have been pushing fast since crossing the Missouri River and we should reach the Yellowstone in about three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bird appeared nervous , a sharp departure from the cool assured manner of his past behavior.  | Continuing in a low voice , he said , " Jim says that he will release you and your woman . He also said that he will let you take the two lame horses . We will soon be out of your domain and you will no longer be of value to us . " " That is good , " replied Turtleheart . " I do not believe that she will be able to go much farther . But why are you with these pale ones ? You and I are both Sioux and we must speak with a straight tongue as one brother to another . " " Well spoken , Turtleheart , but you do not know what I know . " The Santee stopped in search for the right words . " In thinking of all the people I know , I can see a long procession , both Indian and white . In these past winters , mostly white . " A hard bitterness crept into the voice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we lived as free people until a few winters ago . Now the old life is gone ; the pale ones are highest in authority . With their many blue coats and weapons , they have taken all of what was ours . We are no more than driftwood left after a flood . White men own most of our land , not with his brothers , but by himself . They strive to own more than the next , and in seeking these possessions , they fight between themselves . Right and wrong seems the same to them . " Thin Bird fought to control the emotion on his face . " On my people 's side we have no goals , no aims . For many , the only purpose in life is to get drunk ; not to retain that which they and their brothers have had for hundreds of moons . Also , many refuse to change their habits of living , because freedom is to them the right to hunt , to feast . " " Thin Bird , " interrupted Turtleheart , " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mouse . We are a proud people , and what we do now will determine our destiny in the sacred Paha Sapa . If we fail to act , we are cowards . Only fools would lay down their weapons and surrender . We must make the white people understand this . We must fight them and show we are not children . Ho , it is better to die in battle . "  | Thin Bird laughed bitterly before replying . " I 'll tell you . Understand my words and you will not be so shocked at my story . " " Some time ago , I became a scout for the blue coats , the horse soldiers of the government . I will not attempt to tell all the reasons why I did so , but I was one of the remnants of a hand of Santees who were crushed by overwhelming forces of white soldiers . All of my relatives were killed , and so was my spirit . 1 had nothing but my body , and in order to feed it , I joined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 n return I was to help them by being a scout . " " I soon became the leader of the scouts , and of course , this enlarged the opportunity to help my people . I also came in closer contact with the blue coats and developed a sort of friendship with them , and a close friendship with the beardless one , Jim . He taught me English and the ways of the white man . He upheld my talking thoughts and my actions . He was my only true friend among the whites . " As i f talking to himself , Thin Bird kept talking in a low monotone , " One day , he got into trouble , which was of great concern to the other blue coats . When he asked me to scout for him , 1 said yes . He told me his officers would not like him leaving the army post , so we must leave while the others slept . That night we sneaked away from the fort with two others and started for the gold fields . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to get horses and provisions for our long journey . The pace was hard on the horses and they were very tired , when we happened on your camp . We intended to steal your horses , but you stayed so close , we could not . Jim and the others wanted to kill both of you , but I convinced them this would be bad . " Tapping Turtleheart on the knee to emphasize his words , Thin Bird went on . " When your relatives discovered the wrong , they would track us down like wolves to avenge your deaths . It was best to take you as hostages , so your people would do nothing to bring you harm . And now we are here where you will be released to go home . "  | " My heart lies on the ground for you , Thin Bird . I do not agree with you on many things , but I must thank you for sparing our lives . When we are free , you will never need to fear our telling on you . Evensigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white men , because she has lived as a Sioux since a tiny baby , and has grown up under our culture . Tell me , Thin Bird , what do the white men say of her ? " " Since the first day , I made them understand that the first man to lay a hand on your pale face woman would die like a dog , with a knife at his throat . " " I do not trust the one called Jim , the beardless one . " Turtleheart warned . " I do not like the growing desire in his eyes as he watches Evensigh . Her safety is my concern . He may be your true friend , but the passion for a woman can do strange things to a man . " Instead of answering this question , Thin Bird rose and walked away . It was only after he arranged his bed on the far side of the fire that he looked at Turtleheart . With gestures of his hand in sign language , he said he would watch the actions of Jim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turtleheart lay down on the ground which pressed comfortably against his aching body . But tired as he was , to sleep was impossible . Too many things were in his mind . And he must make plans on how to get back to camp after release .  | Like an animal , Turtleheart sensed it before he saw it . The eye of the warrior was trained to detect imminent danger , and the slight movement near Evensigh was enough to cause his body to become tense . Someone was in the act of molesting his bride and had to be stopped . With a sudden and powerful spring , Turtleheart was upon the form of the intruder . With his legs he scissored the man 's waist . With powerful fingers around the neck , he gave one quick jerk and his opponent went limp . The spinal cord had been broken so quickly there was no chance of an outcry . Lifting Evensigh , Turtleheart 's mind was searching for a plan of escape . There was no alternative now , so he must act quickly and quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no sign of Thin Bird , so the one he had killed must have been a white man . " Quiet , " whispered Turtleheart . Gently lowering her so she could walk , he whispered , " Because of Thin Bird we ca n't risk getting our ponies , so follow me . " Taking Evensigh 's hand , he quietly led the way north through the cover of the woods . Dawn was awakening in the cast , but it was not light enough to distinguish the many branches and brambles of the underbrush . Evensigh made every effort to adapt her pace to the long steps of her husband . To keep from moaning as they tore through the tangled underbrush , she clenched her jaws . Reaching an especially dense thicket of brush , Turtleheart bade her lie down in the darkest spot and to keep quiet . " I will  | be back soon , " he whispered . " I must get the horses or turn them loose . We have no chance to escape if they have the horses . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scramble back into the thicket beside Evensigh . The twisted and grotesque limbs of the wild plum trees were a perfect screen for their hiding place . There would be little difficulty in avoiding an encounter with the white men in these jungles , but Thin Bird was a different kind of foe . Would he join in the search ? And how good was he at tracking ? Having made his decision , the couple pushed forward to lengthen the distance from those who were by now pursuing them . Collapsing beneath the hanging limbs of a large pine tree , Evensigh suddenly felt violently ill . Rolling over onto her side , she vomited convulsively until nothing more remained in her stomach . Still the retching continued , the uncontrollable heaving sapping her little remaining strength . Turtleheart appeared , carrying some water in his breachclout . The pure , sweet water made her feel much better , and now she was aware of the numbness in her legs . They felt paralyzed . " We shall rest here until sundown , then we must move on to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Turtleheart was trying to soothe her . However , nothing seemed to matter to Evensigh by now ; she did not even feel worried about capture . The only thing that mattered was rest for her tortured body , even if it meant death . Hours later , Turtleheart returned and v ; ently picked the exhausted girl up in his arms . Instinctively she put her arms around his neck , and muzzled her face against his chest . A sharp flash of pain skipped down her legs and she became angry at having been awakened . Her angry response shocked Turtleheart into exclaiming defensively , " I am sorry , but we must go . We must go to a safer place where there is some water . It will be worse if we do not reach safer ground . "  | Evensigh was acutely aware of Turtleheart 's movements as he carried her , and it seemed an eternity until she heard the comforting sound of water as it murmured down a little valley . Gently depositing her on the grassy bank of the stream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooling waters of the stream . Evensigh could feel her tired muscles relax , and she started to feel as though life was again worth the struggle . Turtleheart warned her not to move and that he was going to find some food . He would be right back , he assured her , and he strode up the little knoll and disappeared from sight . She lay staring out over the hillsides , her hands clenching the long grass which brushed against her thighs . Her mind ran in circles , but when she thought of their escape from the white men her spine stiffened . A surge of pride and defiance rose within her bosom , as she knew that she had earned that right . Had n't she proven to her husband and to others that she was strong and could withstand the trials of hardship ? Feeling better , she soon fell into a sleep of exhaustion . Dusk was beginning to enshroud the countryside as Turtleheart was cleaning a cottontail rabbit . A twig snapped and as he whirled to face the sound ; he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thud and he fell prone , the earth pressing against his nostrils until he could hardly breathe . His sudden whirling movement saved him a full blow , and he lay on the ground only half stunned . In the fog of semi-consciousness he could hear the voice of Evensigh pleading , and the familiar voices of two white men as they cursed . Try as he might , he could not move , and the fogginess of the unconscious world closed in on him until he could no longer hear . Regaining consciousness , Turtleheart painfully became aware that he was laying over a partly buried log , and that he was stripped naked . Trying to move his arms and legs he discovered that they were tightly bound with rawhide to stakes driven into the ground . " He tries to move , " a guttural voice exclaimed . It was impossible for Turtleheart to see the man , but as he felt the  | lash across his bare back and hip , he knew who it was . The splitting noise of the whip caused Turtleheart to flinch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter a sound , and his hard breathing gave the only clue to the punishment he endured . Time after time he felt the lash . At each stroke , he clenched his teeth until the jaw and neck muscles stood out in cords . His back arched before each blow and flattened after each stroke . Turtleheart was conscious of Evensigh 's voice , her cries sounding far away , her sobs like those of a deer . They gave him super-human strength , a grim determination to endure the lashing and to kill the men responsible . Feeling his blood running down his torso from the diagonal gutters cut by the whip , he made a silent vow of vengeance . His executioner tired , and gave the whip to the other man who proceeded to follow his companion 's example by making a bloody pattern across Turtleheart 's back from the other side . By now the merciless lashing had ceased to move the tortured body . Unconsciousness had eased the pain , but the man continued until the pattern on the back was made up of bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Convinced that the Indian was dead , the whipper at last lay down the lash , expressing satisfaction with the deed . During the entire exhibition of brutality , Evensigh had been held helplessly in the strong grip of the white men . Each stroke cut deeply into her mind and spurred her spirit , giving her strength to struggle against the whites . As the whipping continued however , the anguish in her vitals took its toll , and her only reaction was to give the pitiful wails of Indian women at the time of death . When the lashing ceased , the only sounds to be heard were the wails of Evensigh and the heavy breathing of the two men . She knew that no human could endure the excruciating pain Turtleheart had suffered , and live . Yet hope , which is common among womanhood , forced her to whisper over and over , " Please . . . Please ... let him live ... he can live ... please ... " Impressed with the pleading of her voice , the man holding  | her relaxed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her knees she caressed Turtleheart 's head . The white men stood transfixed and uncomfortable as they watched her gently brush her lips over the pale face , the shoulders , the bloody back . The blood on her face added to the expression of shocked horror on her features . Unable to watch any further , the men turned away without a word . Evensigh now lay alongside the prone figure and rubbed the tips of her fingers through the black hair . She told herself it was all over , and that if Turtleheart died , she also wanted to die . Rising to her feet , she ran to where the white men were kneeling and grabbed at the knife one of them wore . He struck her arm , deflecting it , so did not see her foot as she kicked him in the groin . He writhed on the ground as she faced the other man . This was no longer a hysterical girl , but a woman who was ready to kill as the puma would kill . Flinging herself upon the astonished white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and tore out a piece of his cheek . One man was down on the ground moaning and the other was holding his face in his hands when she spied the knife . With an oath of hate , she picked up the knife and was about to plunge it into the red beard 's bowels , when a firm hand grabbed her wrist and wrenched the knife away . Throwing the knife across the clearing was Thin Bird . " No ! No , Evensigh , the knife is too quick and much too merciful . They must die by the whip , as they did unto your man . " Turning on his heel , Thin Bird gave the full force of his hand to the one with the torn cheek , knocking him sprawling . A shot rang out and Thin Bird clutched his chest as he fell back with the mark of death already on his features .  | Evensigh was only a physical being , without mental comprehension as to what went on around her . The crunching sound of the horses hooves and occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing of which she was aware , was the rope around her neck with one end tied to the saddle of one of the riders . The night was dark , but not nearly so dark as the deep despair within her soul . The cool air of the night eventually revived Evensigh , causing her brain to clear so she could understand her plight . With a strange resignation , she decided it was a relief to face the truth ... the loss of courage to fight back against the inevitable . Without courage , the feeling of desolation was rampant and she hated the earth with its cruel beauty ; the white men she had been warned about by her instructors ; the whole world . She longed to be free from all of its evil . So oblivious of her surroundings was she , that she had not seen the flashing of lightning in the night sky . The spatter of rain on her face startled her , and taking notice of the sky , she saw that dawn was already spreading across the eastern horizon . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the approaching daylight . Slouched in their saddles , they showed the fatigue of long travel without sleep . As the overcast sky lightened , Evensigh could see that they were now crossing rolling plains , the outline of the dark mountains at her back . Her perspective was beginning to clear now that light had returned to the earth . From somewhere within her being came a scolding murmur ? she had com- pletely forgotten her Indian mother 's advice . Now her words returned ? Do not let your faith in survival grope about as blind men do , have faith . There will always be a stronger hand than a human hand to guide you . ' Evensigh 's present circumstances seemed to belie her mother 's words , but those words were now of great comfort . She must have faith , even if she was forced to walk , led like an animal . With the revival of spirit , Evensigh knew that the Great Holy would make her life bearable , but it was up to her to make it possible . The renewed hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her present appearance . Her moccasins were mudstained and soggy , her once beautiful dress scarred from neck to hemline , grim evidence of her ordeal . The long hair which was always a source of pride was now a tangle of snarls with strands of damp locks hanging down in her face . At camp she had been told she was mocking a wild woman by not binding her hair , but such statements were made in good-natured , admiring jests by her friends . If they saw her hair now , all matted with leaves and blood , they would surely .. . But , to get back to the present , she knew that she must cut her hair short like the older women do when they are in mourning for a cherished one who will never return to the life on earth . She must also cut gashes in the flesh of her arms and legs in remembrance of Turtleheart . She was so lost in her thoughts , she did not realize that the horses ahead of her had stopped . As she raised her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strange fashion . She returned the gaze and steadfastly refused to lower her eyes . They could not endure her contemptuous eyes and averted theirs . Without looking at Evensigh , they fixed a meal and gave her a portion , without saying a word . She did not think that she would be able to eat the food , but she knew she had to , to keep up her strength . The men made no effort to move on , and her woman 's intuition told her they could not and would not make any move to molest her , so she lay down to sleep .  | The uncomfortable sensation of being too warm awakened Evensigh , and her movements attracted the attention of her unwanted companions . Motioning to her , they conveyed the idea they were to move on , even though the sun was at its highest in the sky . There was some satisfaction in noting that the rope had more slack , and that the horses were moving at a slower pace . The knowledge that the men were treating her more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sun was only a hand 's width above the horizon when the party neared a settlement . From the type of strange lodges , Evensigh knew that this was a white community , and once again misgivings entered her mind . These were not her people , and considering her experiences with them , there would be little to expect . Some distance from the settlement a small group of men on horses met them . They talked in their strange language for some time and occasionally became boisterous . From the many glances passed her way , Evensigh knew the men were discussing her . To show her disdain , she shook her head defiantly while trying to brush away the flies which were buzzing around the group . Evensigh concluded that these men were giving her a visual appraisal so as to put a price on her head , much like the braves do when a horse was placed in the village trading circle . As the conversation progressed , there was evidence of some disagreement and an occasional word of anger . To her surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed the strangers to . disarm them . One of the strange men then removed the rope from around her neck , and he was so gentle , it surprised her . The young woman who was taken into the cluster of strange homes was a very bewildered creature , but this soon turned into resentment as men , women and children of all  | sizes came out to watch . To be displayed like a prize pony was annoying . A squatty , but pleasant looking woman took charge of Evensigh , and led her into a small log lodge . This woman fascinated Evensigh , and all the things she did were a source of wonderment . The woman was preparing food in a ridiculous manner , using odd cookware . The smell of the cooking food was very tempting though , after the type of fare served to her the past few days . To sit in chairs at the white man 's table was another new experience for Evensigh , but the strangeness of it all did not prevent Evensigh from consuming all of the food in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rations of the past meals . The white woman looked at her in amazement as Evensigh shoveled the food from her plate into her mouth with a piece of bread . Grateful for the food , she abided by the Indian rule of etiquette , which dictated that the host must not be insulted by leaving food on the plate . Doubts about the stories told by her elders , skirted the edge of Evensigh 's mind . This was the first person to show any friendliness or warmth toward her , and she was white . It was possible not all whites were evil . With a sigh of resignation , the woman dipped her ladle into the pot for another helping , only to be stopped by Evensigh tugging at her sleeve . The girl put her hand to her face and the woman smiled at her and motioned to the top bed which was in the room . So physically tired was Evensigh that she did not take off any of her clothing except for kicking off her moccasins , and immediately climbed the ladder to stretch out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come soon , she did not go to sleep at once . The room was too hot and stifling for one who was used to the openness of the Indian lodge . Lying on the pallet , she studied the room carefully and with awe . She had never seen a lodge like this , where the bed was off the floor and there were things to sit on and eat from .  | The bedding seemed strange too , no skins or robes , just white , thin coverings . And the bed was much too soft . How could anyone sleep on something which gave with every movement and squeaked every time she turned on it ? She pondered for a long time about the strange appearance and behavior of the woman who was so kind . The kindness was just as unbelieveable as the cruelty of the two men who had lashed Turtleheart . At the thought of Turtleheart , tears welled in her eyes . He was so warm , so tender and thoughtful of her . So friendly to everyone else . He was such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad word with any of his people . They were all very proud of him , but not nearly so proud as Evensigh . In her mind she thought that perhaps she did wrong in claiming Turtleheart as her very own . Maybe it was not meant for her to capture his heart . If he was destined not to become her mate , maybe the spider creature had put a curse on the marriage and doomed them to a tragic end . These thoughts pained Evensigh and left her heartsick . As she felt the drowsiness surrounding her as the fog , she experienced a queer sensation of growing wings which would enable her to soar above the earth away from this place and to the land of her many friends in an Indian village among the rolling hills . There would be a valley and it would have cool , clear water ; many trees ; long grass and . . . the picture faded as the sleep of exhaustion overtook her . The following morning there was a knock at the door . A middle aged white man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock was answered . After speaking briefly with the woman he turned toward Evensigh and spoke in the language of the Sioux . " My name is Reynolds and I work for the army as a Sioux interpreter . " Upon hearing the man speak , Evensigh 's eyes opened wide with interest . " The two men who brought you in , told of finding you with an Indian , and the corn- mander of the post here has arranged to have you returned to your own relatives . . . do you know where they are ? " " Oh yes , " she fairly shouted , " I am from Chiefeagle 's band of the Teton Sioux . " " Not back to the Indians , girl . " Reynolds summarily dismissed her statement with a casual wave of his hand . " You are a white girl . They want to send you back to your own family . " " Chiefeagle 's family is my family , " she insisted . The interpreter shrugged his shoulders and left the cabin . He returned by late afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the two talked while glancing toward Evensigh who stood by the window . At last , Mr. Reynolds spoke to her in Sioux . " Do you speak English ? No ? Well the post commander says it is out of the question for you to rejoin the band of Chiefeagle . He has arranged for you to be taken to St. Louis by a couple who are going there on a business trip . Mr. Callahan owns a big store in St. Louis , and you could do a lot worse , girl . They have offered to bring you up like a proper young white lady . " " I do not want to go . Why do they want me ? " " Well girl , the way I understand it , both of their boys have grown up and left home . Their daughter died a couple of years ago and I guess they plan on making you a part of the family . You sure do not look nor smell like a Callahan , but you sure are pretty . " Reynolds voice droned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Louis . Her mind moved quickly . If she was to be held among the whites , she would be better off with someone who asked for her . " I will go , " she answered hesitantly .  | The sound of a hundred bird voices echoed in Turtleheart 's ears as he regained his senses . How long had he been lying there ? A cold wind sent shivers up and down his spine , the ripples sending arrows of pain across his raw and bloody back . A prism of sunlight filtered through the trees , striking him in the eyes . The eastern sun . He had been there all night ? or had it been two ? His body felt as though a herd of wild horses had trampled him , and to raise his hand took all of his strength and courage . Hazily looking at his outstretched arms , he could see they were still bound . The rawhide cords were wet because of an extremely heavy dew , and hung with much slack . The Holy Mystery was surely on his side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he still lived . With his right hand , Turtleheart clawed at the damp earth around the stake . The exertion brought beads of nervous perspiration out over his body , despite the coolness of the early morning . With desperation his fingers gnawed steadily at the ground until the stake loosened . With the last of his strength he pulled the stake from the earth as the grey fog of unconsciousness crept over him . Turtleheart fought this momentary lapse with all of his being , as he knew he did not have much time . The sun would soon be high enought to shine on the strips of rawhide and they would tighten to cut off the blood supply to his hands and feet . He worked furiously to loosen his other hand , and when successful , tried to raise himself with his arms . The effort sent  | currents of scorching pain across his back . It was unbearable and he fell back on his chest , his body quivering . With eyes closed , he made a supreme effort to gain a position from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holiest One for helping him , and vowed to take the Sun Dance for his deliverance if he could make his way back to his village . Turtleheart was thankful , too , that he had taken heed of his grandfather 's wisdom , and had strengthened his body to the highest peak of condition . With every joint and muscle aching from the long period of forced inactivity , he struggled to his feet . His knees were weak and Turtleheart stumbled backwards to fall over the body of Thin Bird . Landing on his back , he , like a snapping bow , flipped over to his front side and lay waiting for the sharp edges of pain to recede . Looking into Thin Bird 's sightless eyes , he could do no more than stare at the inert form . When his reeling brain steadied , the young brave put together the story of all that which must have happened . " Evensigh ! " The thought of his bride caused the youth to stand . She was nowhere to be seen . The full story of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signs he read on the ground . He also saw where two men and a woman had mounted horses and left . Evensigh was still captive . Turtleheart staggered to the stream and lowered his aching body into the cold waters . They cleansed the wounds in his back and soothed the burning fires in his body . When he was able , he smeared wet earth across the lash marks , and took Thin Bird 's clothing for his own . The garments would shield his back from the sun and would give him the identity of an Indian , in case his people should find him . With an aching heart , Turtleheart knew that he could not follow Evensigh . First he must recover from his wounds . Not to do so would be foolhardy since he would surely die , a fact he could not accept . Next , he must see a Yuwipi man , his own grandfather . His advice would be most welcome .  | The trail he left on his way to help was a weaving one because of his weak condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the direction of where he knew his grandfather waited . As he walked , he thought of the eventual destruction of the hated gray ones . He would carry the lance until Evensigh had been avenged . To Turtleheart , as he looked in all directions , the countryside seemed to be so lifeless . For the first time in his young life , the things of nature did not appeal to him . His mind refused to accept nature 's magnificence ; he was no longer interested in the things which surrounded him . Conscience and mind were both tethered to Evensigh and to her safety and rescue . Obligation arises from relationship , and theirs had been so intimate and mutual , that the difficulties they had shared since meeting Thin Bird had to be avenged . Right or wrong , no matter what methods he might use , he must follow the dictates which lay before him . If he performed them well , he would stand high in the esteem of his people as would be expected of him , the grandson of Chiefeagle . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composing the seven council fires , would demand that he take such action . The stumbling gait of Turtleheart became even slower as he tried to ponder the words of his grandfather . Without realizing it , he stopped , and the words became more coherent . He could hear those words of wisdom by Chiefeagle as if they were just being spoken . " My son , the duty of doing is in the doing for each and all ; both the strong and the weak , and to the best of your ability and strength . To give up when all is against you , is a sign of being weak and cowardly . If you are confused and can not think the straight way , take the vow to dance the Sun Dance . The Holy Mystery who watches over us will grant you the strength to attain your answer ... ! " As the words faded away in Turtleheart 's mind , he could see his grandfather s form in a hazy mist . Raising his arms , and with great emotion , Turtleheart began a prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were no audible sounds , but only the movements of the lips as they formed the words . " Oh , Holy Mystery , my guiding power and Master , look at me and take me by the hand . I am a poor and groping youth who is lost in the vastness of the unknown . I need strength , the strength only You can give , to face the tomorrows . Today the sun does not shine for me , but is hidden behind the dark clouds of despair . My heart is laden with sorrow , and I know that the most precious things of life are obtained through sorrow , but my spirit is burdened with more than I alone can carry . I invoke You to comfort me as I carry this great pain . Oh Great Spirit , I need the power of will , so that I may find my beloved Evensigh . " " To thank You for permitting me to live and to gain the vital strength of mind and body to do what I must , I now take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . " His silent prayer ended , Turtleheart remained with outstretched arms until waves of color swirled around and engulfed him . The sound of Thunder was roaring in his ears , he had his answer from the Almighty above . Slowly his knees gave way and Turtleheart dropped to kneel on the ground for one moment before crumpling to a prone position . Lying on his side , his hands grasping at his folded knees , he was acutely aware of being more tired than he could ever remember . Stiffening legs tastified to the great strain he had endured . His hands felt numb from being tied to the stakes . His back felt as if there were a hundred fires burning into his flesh . Pangs of hunger gnawed at his vitals . Hated but uncontrollable tears were coursing in dirty furrows across his cheeks . Even the strongest of men sometimes weep in self pity . Recovering his composure after a few moments , he knew he must go on . There could be not rest , no peace , no comfort until he heard Evensigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and hold her in his arms .  | There was no shame within Turtleheart concerning his tears . They were the life blood of man 's emotions , but they should never be shed in the presence of others . This type of behavior was frowned upon by his people ; the proud would look down with disdain , the merciless would reproach him , as tears were thought to be an indication of a man 's crumbling courage . Turtleheart was alone in the embrave of the bosom of Mother Earth , so he could shed some of his sorrow in unabated tears , proud tears which the Holy Mystery would understand and approve of . The lonely warrior cried himself to sleep as the sun silently sank below the horizon . The warm glow of the rising sun was making itself felt when Turtleheart became aware of the daylight . The warm rays were soothing to his body and seemed to break the sense of fatigue which had held him in its grip . With the instinct of the wild animal , the Sioux youth knew that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbing the dried matter from his eyes and reflecting on the evening before . The pangs of the hunger in his stomach became too much to bear . He craved meat ; fresh meat with the blood draining from it . To one weaned on this diet , meat hunger can grow into madness . He must have meat ! Rising gingerly to his feet so at to not start his back to bleeding again , Turtleheart made his way down to the banks of a small river which was only a few yards away . With his clothing off , and the cold water caressing his naked body , he could feel the fatigue leaving his aching muscles . Leaving the cold water , he allowed the warm sun to dry his skin before dressing . Wishing he had some oil or fat to rub on his wounds , the youth looked around for signs of game . With luck , he would soon have meat to appease his hunger and fat to soften the skin of his lacerated back . Knowing the skill of the hunt , the brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game to come to him . He decided to remain where he was , as his condition would not permit  | him to travel very far . After many hours of patience , the sun had crossed the top of the sky before he noticed a slight movement in the brush . The eye of the hunter is trained to see that which is not a normal part of the terrain . Survival depends upon being alert to any foreign movement . Thanking the Holy Mystery , Turtleheart picked up the bow and quiver which had belonged to Thin Bird and waited behind the low sage brush he was using for cover . The deer , unaware of the hidden human , trotted into the opening adjoining the river . Its nostrils were quivering in an attempt to smell an enemy , when the arrow sped to its mark . Sore limbs and aching back were momentarily forgotten as the Sioux skillfully loosed two more arrows in rapid succession . The young buck reared up and fell over , struggled to his feet , ran a few steps and fell again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segment of a shattered piece of flint which he used as a knife to disembowel the deer and cut out the liver . With the hot blood running down his chin and ribs , the Sioux ate part of the liver before turning his attention to the building of a fire . To start a fire with dried moss and a piece of flint struck on a stone was easy , and a sage wood fire was soon blazing furiously . While he waited for the fire to die down into a bed of coals for roasting , Turtleheart sliced a thick slab from the rump of the deer . As the low flames cooked the venison , the savory smell was almost more than he could endure . The hurried consumption of the large piece of meat , washed down with water , would have made a civilized white man deathly ill . But not so for Turtleheart . Only too often the Indian had to starve until there was a successful hunt , then gorge himself as if there would never be another meal . This was the normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and another night of rest revived the body and spirit of Turtleheart and enabled him to travel for the next several days toward his home . While walking along , the figure of an Indian on a horse topped a rise in the near distance and stood there silhouetted against the sky . This was a  | beautiful sight for one who was lonely , and the impulse to give the howl of the wolf took hold of him . The echo of this cry of friendship was good to hear . It had been many days since he had heard the sound of his own voice . The lone sentry who had been watching Turtleheart thread his way through the brush and trees , waved his acknowledgement and rode slowly down to meet the wanderer on foot . " Hunka ! Hunka ! My son , my son . " was the incredulous cry of the rider . Jumping from his horse and running to Turtleheart , he embraced him . " What has happened to you ? Where is Evensigh ? " " Hunka Ate , I carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue coats , set upon us without warning . They lashed me until I could no longer feel the whip . They stole her from me . They stole her and I could do nothing . " The feelings of the Hunka and the Hunka Ate toward each other run very deep , and Turtleheart was very thankful that this should be the very first person he should see . The relationship of the Hunka is difficult to define , for it is neither brotherhood nor of blood kinship . It binds the two individuals in a pact much stronger than friendship and sometimes stronger than when they have the same parents . The Hunka Ate is the older of the two and is almost the same as a father . This has been true among the Sioux since the very beginning . " Come . A temporary shelter , which I have set up , is just over the hill . We will go there and I will make up some medicine for your wounds . You sleep and then we will talk . " Gall , a war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie on his bed of skins . Carefully stripping the clothing from the boy 's body , his hands trembled . Gall then gently rubbed warm bear oil on the tortured back . A sense of guilt lay on Gall 's conscience , as he felt he was to blame for the whipping and Evensigh 's abduction . As Hunka Ate , he should have kept a close watch of his Hunka to protect him and his Evensigh from possible danger . He ,  | Gall , should never have consented to being Hunka Ate if he could not protect his ward . It was only natural that Turtleheart was too enraptured with love to be alert against danger . " My heart lays on the ground , my son . My grief is a burden I must bear for you . I will carry the lance for you . Now sleep , my boy , and you will feel better . " Knowing he was safe with a trusted friend , Turtleheart was soon in a world of dreams . In this dream he re-lived the current of events which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day when a band of Hunkapapas came to his village to seek help in fighting the whites . The leader of this band was called Yellow Forehead by his followers , but he was called Gall by Chiefeagle and his village . A strong friendship between the famous Gall and himself developed , and Gall was his idol . The deep understanding between man and boy impressed Chiefeagle , so his Grandfather contrived to have a Hunka ceremony set up so Gall could adopt the boy . With vivid memory , he was seeing again the parts of the Hunka Ceremony ; the buffalo skull with horns attached , the two rattles , the sweet grass and sage , the ear of corn , the fire carrier , the special drum , the scaffold . Especially vivid now were the two Hunka wands , two of them of the same size . They were four spans long and the small ends were as big around as a man 's small finger . About a third of the way from the big end were attached six quills from the golden eagle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these feathers radiated in a glorious circle . A third of the way from the small end , a bunch of hair from the tail of the horse was fastened in the form of a tassel . A similar tassel of buffalo hair was on the small end . The wands and the scaffold were both painted red . Some of the details were hard to remember , as he was not very old at the time . His grandfather had often mentioned them since , such as the informal uses of the wands and rattles . The smoking of the pipe , though , was very clear . This had been the most important part of the day , as the pipe was  | the greatest symbol of prayer to Wakan Tanka , the Holy Mystery . He recalled the great pride he had felt at being bound to Gall with thongs ; arm to arm , side to side , leg to leg . A red stripe was painted across their faces from cheek to cheek and forehead to chin across the nose . The conductor waved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to your Hunka , and he is as of yourself . When you put the stripe on your face , you must remember that what you have , is his also . And what he has , he will give to you if you desire it . You must help him in his time of need . If someone harms him , you must carry the lance to avenge him , for it is as if you were harmed . Your horses , your robes are his and his are yours . His children are as if they were yours . If he is killed in battle , you shall not be satisfied until you have provided a companion for his spirit . If he is sick , you should take presents to the man with medicine to make him well . That is all . You are now Hunka . " The feast and the dance that night , given in honor of the new Hunka Ate and Hunka , was something he would never forget . The give-away dances , the round dances , the honor dances and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great event .  | Turtleheart 's dreams were so profound that Gall had to shake him repeatedly . " Hunka , your thoughts are far away . You were talking in your sleep . Come back to this place . I have warmed you some herb soup , and it will be good for you . Drink all of it , it will be of comfort to your stomach . " Gall set the steaming bowl beside Turtleheart and sat facing his Hunka . " While you are drinking your soup , " said Gall , " I will tell you why I am in this country , so far from my village . " A few moments passed while he wondered how far back to go in time . Perhaps it would be best to start with the time of the Hunka Ceremony which was now twelve winters past . Turtleheart sipped at the hot soup and waited . He knew that Gall was thinking of what to say . Breaking the silence , Gall continued . " I did not get any volunteers from your village the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most remote part of the land to set up his lodges . Your people do not come in much contact with the whites and they are not familiar with the trickery of the white man in his conquest of our land . They do not know that all around them the pale ones are turning the ground upside down , killing the buffalo , and putting the Indian on small areas of ground . They do not know that the people on these reservations are forced to live on small amounts of food , hardly enough to keep them from sickness . " Gall 's voice had begun in a dull monotone , but as it continued , it grew more and more angry . To ease his fury , he  | rose from his place and walked about . To Turtleheart , there was something curiously magnetic about this brave man . He had the tongue of an orator , and his gestures were almost a second language of accompaniment to the spoken word . These gifts compelled all to listen and admire what he had to say . Gall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The days of families visiting one another ; the fun and relaxation of the old men in the shade ; the women laughing and gossiping and playing the hand game ; the children without worry , playacting like elders ; they will soon be over . The mighty Sioux will lose those days , just like their cousins to the east , unless they forget their differences and join all of their might against the whites . " Gall paused to clear his throat , then went on . " I was warned by Little Crow , a chief among the Santees , not to smoke the white man 's smoke , or drink the white man 's fire water , or eat of his food . He warned too , that to live like the white man would destroy our heritage . The white would not help the Indian . Instead , he would take away from the Indian and never give him rest . He spoke with a straight tongue , as the men of the traps agree . " Bitterly now , Gall 's voice kept on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They talk with a crooked tongue . " He acted as to shake out the unpleasantness in his mind . To Gall there were but two things a man could do to others ; love or hate . Gall chose to hate all white people , not because of their pale skins , but because most of those he knew or had known , did not show honor . It was much better to be defeated in battle by an enemy Indian , than to suffer defeat at the hands of those who broke promises . The man actually shivered at the . mere thought of being conquered by the heartless whites . To his people , war was not a business of extermination , but a test of courage . The hunt of buffalo on enemy land , the stealing of horses and the combat between enemies was done by small war parties , and was worthy of high honors.  | " We have tried to avoid battle with the invaders , " Gall stated , " until a thief 's road was built through our land to the yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect this trail . We retaliated by attacking and killing a band of blue coats near Fort Kearney . " " It was two winters before that , when we were surprised by those blue coats who killed many of our families ... even babies . Since that black day , I have been on the path of war . I have helped at the battles of Fort Kearney , Wagon Box , Horseshoe Station and others . " His face now livid with rage , Gall was now walking like a caged bear . He continued his exhortation while pointing one hand toward the Black Hills . " The Paha Sapa is the last remaining symbol of our people 's great might . We must not permit the whites to violate this sacred ground by digging for the yellow iron . These hills are sacred because of their symbolic nature , the expression of the Great Spirit . " Silently , Turtleheart reflected on the truth of what Gall had said . His thoughts were interrupted by Gall 's finishing statement . " Hunka , I am sorry for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I must speak like this when I know our way of life is on the brink of a chasm that yawns wide to swallow us . Please forgive me for forgetting that you are suffering a great hurt , and not letting you tell your story . " With a great deal of hesitation , because of the emotion in his voice , Turtleheart started at the beginning of his marriage when he and Evensigh left for the wedding journey . He told all of the details and was very particular in the description of the white tormentors . As he brought his narration up to the point where he had first seen Gall , Gall spoke for the first time since the start . " You have endured tortures men many times your age have never had to suffer , Turtleheart . It is because of these things that your heart is old . Your heart is strong and your honor is of the highest degree , so you will allow nothing to  | block your path in doing what you must do . You will keep your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I have paid the closest attention to that which you have told , and I find that I do not know the condition of their heads , not even Thin Bird . My stomach turns over at the thought of a Santee betraying his own . Perhaps his actions were the result of the white man being his associate . The greed rubbed off the white skin to his own and he could not see the straight way . This thing I do know . " In a thoughtful mood , Gall picked up the empty soup bowl , idly turning it over in his hands . In a meditative tone he seemed to talk to himself . " It is in my mind they laid the lash to your back to send your spirit to the place of the dead . Your body was left for the wild animals to feed upon . You had good medicine and your body was strong , so you did not die . " There was a short silence while Gall searched for appropriate words . Turtleheart was dismayed at what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she may be sold for a slave , as they did in the east . We must keep our ears open for news of her . For you to be patient will be hard , but if you keep your head , you will surely find her . " For many minutes no word passed between the two men as each was lost in his own thoughts . Gall broke the silence by saying , " Two days ago , I arrived at your village with a message for Chiefeagle . I volunteered to bring this message for two reasons . First , I wanted the opportunity to see you in your new manhood , to see the quality of man you ripened into . To deliver the message was second in my thoughts . Upon delivering the message from Red Cloud , Chiefeagle called a council of all the clans at his camp . Red Cloud had appealed to all the Sioux to talk of leasing the so-called mineral rights in the Black Hills to the white man . The elders decided that the whole village should go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the only absent ones . They did not waste time in moving and I stayed behind to await your return . " Considering these words carefully , Turtleheart finally questioned , " Why are these strangers trying to impose themselves on us ? There is not much game left , as they have killed  | most of the buffalo . It must be this yellow iron you speak of that is so important . Red Cloud told us a few moons ago , that there were so many of these pale ones across the Father of Waters that they are living on top of each other . Maybe that is why . " Turtleheart had touched upon a subject about which Gall could speak with much oratory , so Gall began to speak with all of the dignity of a wise council chief . " A man is made to pace out his life in accordance with his own people ; he must be able to walk into their arms . To refuse to do so shows a wall of ill-will through his mind . I have grown up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk through the Paha Sapa and let my mind rest on its meaning to us , my pride turns to a spirit of humility . The beauty surrounding me is more than my words can describe . No language can tell of its Holy Glory . " With a wry smile , Gall now looked at his companion . " You must forgive me , my Hunka . I have been getting away from your thoughts , and have not answered your question . I do not know why the white man feels as he does . I have seen that color only on the belly of the snake creatures who crawl in the grass , but I do not believe that the color of the skin matters . " " It is what is in a man 's mind that matters . They look much like us and they pay homage to the Great Mystery as we do , but unlike us , they worship Him in lodges they call churches and use images of people . I do not understand these things . " " The Great One who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use things He did not create . We pay homage to Him through His own creations , the sun , the earth , the winds , the thunder , the lightning . " Gall was warming to his oratory and he was now on his feet to conclude his speech with a thundering voice . " The Paha Sapa is His sacred ground , and it must not be spoiled by men who worship in mere lodges . " Turtleheart 's eyes were wide with awe as he watched Gall . In Gall 's presence he felt like a small boy , so it was in  | the questioning tone of a child that he asked , " Have you ever lived among the white people ? " " No ! " was the retort . " Never by all that is Holy ! " The sharp reply was accompanied by a clenched fist swinging through the air . " Many times before the treaty was signed at Laramie , I came to know fur traders and trappers . They lived among us from time to time , but they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , respected by all . Hidetrader was one of them . Have you heard of the man called Hidetrader ? " " Yes , I have even seen him when he came to our village . He is as remarkable as the many stories they tell of him . It is hard to think of a white man to be as one of us . " " He is a very remarkable man , " emphasized Gall . " He is as one of us . Did you know he fell in love with a Sioux girl and married her , according to our custom ? He and his woman are now living where the Rapid Creek is swallowed by the Cheyenne River . It was he , Hightrader , who taught me much of how the white man lives . Sitting Bull also told me about the white man 's culture . " Now sitting on his knees and gently rocking back and forth , Gall peered at the younger man 's face with a blank expression . Turtleheart waited for Gall to reach for the words to describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet tones . " Hidetrader always spoke with a straight tongue . You can believe the words he speaks . He has never told a false word to any of our people in all the years he has been with us . He has always been fair and has always been on our level . Once he told me that the Indians would never have to worry about losing their land to the whites because the Great White Father had passed a bill four winters ago . This bill he called the National Indian Policy Action , or something like that . " " When I asked Hightrader about the broken treaties , he did not answer . He believes as I do , that white men 's scratches on paper say we have rights , but they can be burned and so mean nothing . I told him he was good in trying to make me  | feel better inside , but that it was not easy to believe the White Father when he acted in bad faith . " " When men come to us in solemn treaty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Honor with prayer and mention of God while doing these things is mockery . So is it strange that we should look upon these treaties as nothing ? " Turtleheart started to speak and then checked his words . Gall was talking to himself as much as to Turtleheart , so words of answer were not needed . " Red Cloud and the others may as well sign away the Black Hills . They will take it anyway . There are too many of them . For me to go to council with Red Cloud would remind me of the many broken promises and my heart would weep . I know what is to happen , peacefully or not , and in this knowledge , I am bitter . " " I , for one , am ready to die in battle . It is better to die for what you believe than to crawl on the belly . "  | The flap to Chiefeagle 's lodge was closed and fastened so the people would know that they were not to disturb the Patriarch and his grandson within . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advice of one with more years of wisdom than he . " Your arrival here has brought pleasure to my heart , my son , but knowing of Evensigh , a siezure strikes my heart . 1 have seen to it that all of the different bands know of her disappearance . She will be found . Do not give up hope . We must be patient and strong while waiting for word of her . " It was Chiefeagle who spoke with the manner of one who tries to comfort a child . " You have come to me to seek advice , and this I will try to give to you . " Chiefeagle took his pipe out of its richly beaded pouch and proceeded to fill it with native tobacco . His hand trembled as he reached for a dry twig and struck its small end into the hot , low burning fire . He waited a moment and lit the contents of the pipe . Drawing and blowing out a great puff of smoke , he seemed to Turtleheart , an old , tired man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it shows that your mind is big enough to swallow what I have to say to you . Always remember that your mind must be like a tipi . Leave the entrance flap open so that the fresh air can enter and clear out the smoke of confusion . " Leaning forward to peer intently into Turtleheart 's eyes , he took another draw on the pipe before continuing . " My  | grandson , you are of my life , and I must share the load which is on your shoulders . You must be willing to share your deep sorrow with me , and that is why you are here . " This time , the old man took several puffs on the pipe and watched the smoke as it swirled up toward the peak of the tipi . Wisdom does not speak with haste , so he was taking time to consider his next words . " You , my boy , are now learning that anything of worth does not come the easy way , and that the pain of mind and heart must be carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure it was still lit . " Turtleheart , the Chiefest of them all , The Great Mystery silently made nature for us to use and preserve . But nature also imposes its obligations on us . This thing is meant to be . That is why we are Tetons , the camp makers . " " In this , our life , we could say we are men on the move , and when you bring all of our lives to a pointed thought , you will know that we are only passing through life on the way to the Happy Hunting Grounds of our ancestors . " Chiefeagle 's words were slow and measured . To Turtleheart , the next words he was to hear seemed to be more of a command than advice . " Stay here , my grandson , and wait for Evensigh . You must wait for her return . That is the way it is meant . " " Wait ! Stay here and wait ? " Turtleheart 's words were fairly shouted . " To stay here is to die of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing . " Chiefeagle raised his hand in the signal of silence . " Yes , wait . You must wait . If she is alive , she will return . If not , remember , we are only passing through this life to a better one . " The tone was stern , the words clipped , as the old man 's voice continued . " Go from this lodge and walk on the earth of this camp until you have thought over these things I have told you . When you have finished with the struggle of your thoughts , return . Whatever you have to say , I will listen . But now I must go meet with the others at the lodge of Red Cloud . "  | Chiefeagle 's band was camped at the extreme northeast corner of the encampment . They lived the farthest away from the council fire , owing to the late summons they had received . Representatives from the far flung reaches of the Teton Sioux were at this site , chosen for Red Cloud 's council with the government men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Blackfoot ; they were all there . There were also a few Yanktons and Santees from the eastern branch of the Sioux Nation , plus a few Cheyennes and Arapahoes . Each evening , Chiefeagle called the men of his band together , and gave them the details of the day 's progress in the council . On the first day , every member of the band was near the lodge of Chiefeagle , to hear his words . As the days dragged on , they lost interest and relied upon the elders to keep them informed . Late in the afternoon of the seventh day , Chiefeagle entered his lodge with bent shoulders . Worried and tired , he crossed to where Turtleheart waited . To Turtleheart , his grandfather had aged since he last talked to him . He stood to help the old man to sit down . Grandfather Chiefeagle sighed and said , with a thick voice , " All of our talk came to an end today . We can not sign their paper and they refuse to look at our side . They offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they call money . Money means nothing . The Paha Sapa is everything . " Leaning back onto his back rest , the old man angrily fussed with the buffalo robe he was sitting on . " Some of our Chiefs think the white man 's offer good . " t " I can not consign my people to a reservation , knowing they will starve in a few winters . Most of the other chiefs agree with me . The white men were angry . They feel we are being without thought and selfish . f The offer made amounted to a total of $400,000 a year lease for the right to mine gold and to set up farms in the fertile valleys . A counter offer of $6,000,000 for the outright purchase of the Black Hills was also made . The Sioux had to agree to , buy their supplies and to remain on a reservation .  | " I see unhappy years ahead for the Sioux . The white men will show anger for years to come . We must pray to the Holy Mystery and ask that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the seeds of their conscience will awake and grow . I must go and tell my people of what has been done . " Turtleheart helped his tired grandfather to his feet , putting his hands on the thin shoulders with pangs of regret . " I must leave you , grandfather . You can see that I wear my heart on my forehead for all to see . I feel well enough now to travel , and I have decided I must start my search . " " The only reason I remained this long was to give you support in your talks with Red Cloud and the others . I know that I should stand beside you , but I am anxious to go . " Chiefeagle stood with bowed head as Turtleheart lifted the skin flap and paused for another word . At this time of need , when all of the young warriors should rally to the defense of the Sioux , Chiefeagle could not approve of Turtleheart 's rash action . The wisdom of age could not stop the impatience of youth , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoic face showed no emotion , but as his grandfather looked at him for the last time , Turtleheart saw the look in his eyes which mirrored the sorrow within his heart .  | Driven by the hunger within his heart , Turtleheart searched the emptiness of the hills and prairies for his woman . Once , he was told of a fair-skinned woman who lived with a band of Indians . He followed their trail to the northern country , only .. to find she was a half-breed . Discouraged , but ever hopeful , he turned to another direction . The longing desire for Evensigh would not let him sleep for any length of time . Rising before the first shafts of sunlight struck the earth , he made preparations for the day 's travel . Once astride his pony , his spirits would rise and he would say , " Today is the day I find her . " Turtleheart was so intent upon his search that he did not heed the signs which foretold an early winter . His only thoughts were of Evensigh , thoughts which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitary figure on horseback , he wandered from camp to camp , until he had covered all of the Teton Sioux territory west of the Missouri . At some camps he lingered a day or two while waiting for the return of a hunting party , but he never took part in any activity . Sympathetic women would manage to get him to consume a bowl of buffalo soup or rabbit stew ; but when the warriors returned and Turtleheart questioned them , he would leap on his horse and ride off . The women and old men , who were referring to him as the Lonely One , noticed the signs of the fever sickness in him , but Turtleheart heard only the words he wanted to hear . " If  | we see this Evensigh we shall send word to Chiefeagle . Do not fear , you will find her . " The air had now become bitterly cold , but the passion in Turtleheart 's heart gave him the courage to challenge the snow- and wind of the first blizzard that swept the high plains . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the fever mounted , it replaced the tumult within his restless soul . Finding shelter , and with wood in abundance , Turtleheart decided he did not have the strength to go on . He laid prostrate in his robe for eight sleeps with little food or heat until the fever burned itself from his body . He brushed the cobwebs from his brain , and thinking clearly again , he realized how foolish he had been to wander all over the country without a plan , without knowing where to search . During all of those long weeks of driving his body to the point of exhaustion , he had really been trying to drive the torment from himself . Why had n't he remained with his grandfather , who needed him ? Any news of Evensigh would reach his grandfather just as fast as it could . Only by mere chance could he find her this way . The decision was made , and Turtleheart made his way to the lodges of his grandfather . Welcomed with cries of joy , the young man was escorted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is good to see you again . This time you must remain until the evils of sickness are driven away . " " I am thankful to be home , confessed the youth . " I am very sorry now that 1 was so selfish in my thoughts and in my actions . It is bad that I left my grandfather when he needed me at the council . " He watched the woman 's face twist with grief , and he thought , with a frantic sinking sensation , that she had heard had news of the girl she had raised as her own daughter . " You have heard news of Evensigh ? " " No , my son . No word of Evensigh has come . None of the hands have seen her , but we ask each to keep looking . " It was  | not the habit of things close to the heart to be spoken of , but they both knew how deeply the loss was felt by the other . With a mother 's eye , she noted the gaunt frame and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down with the sickness of the white man . Again I say , you must remain here until the shaman can drive the sickness from your inside . " " It is not the white man 's sickness . It was a sickness of my own making . In my search to the four winds , I drove myself until my body weakened to save me from my own mind . " " It was the will of the Holy Mystery , and He has shown me that I have been searching the earth with blind eyes . " With a flash of the old smile , Turtleheart asked , " May I speak with my grandfather ? He is far more wise than I and I need to seek his advice . " At the mention of Chiefeagle , the old woman 's eyes filled with tears and she turned away with a stifled sob . " Two full moons have passed since your grandfather went to the land of our ancestors . " Turtleheart looked at her with eyes that stared with disbelief . " No ! No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the full impact of her words sunk into his brain . Shaking his head , he fought to hold back the tears which were forbidden . Suddenly , he jumped to his feet and rushed from the lodge . He must go away to make amends with himself . What has he done to bring this misfortune to his grandfather ? Thoughts of self-sacrifice were uppermost in his mind as he walked blindly from the village . The cold air caused him to shiver and he went back to camp to enter the lodge of another relative . Entering , he demanded , " Tell me of my grandfather : I want to know all there is to know . Do not be afraid to tell me . " The woman of the lodge was upset at this sudden intrusion of her privacy , but soon recovered . " I will tell you . But why were n't you here when it happened ? " Reproach was in the voice . " You could have done much , but you were gone . "  | Seeing the misery on Turtleheart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with moderation . " Some of the young men were given spirit-water by a passing band , and they became crazy in the head . They continued into the night and became very coarse . Some of the family men went to Chiefeagle and complained about the actions of the young ones . The camp was in an uproar . Chiefeagle was very angry and spoke harsh words to the crazy ones . " In telling her story , the woman had difficulty in controlling the sobs which choked her throat . " The next morning Chiefeagle did not appear , and we all thought he was not feeling well . His sister went into his lodge to see if he was still sleeping . She said he was covered with more than the usual number of robes and thought him ill . Later she went in to waken him and when she threw back the robes , she found your grandfather 's throat had been cut from one jawbone to the other , and his tongue had been torn out . " " She screamed , and we went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found out what happened and called a council meeting immediately . All men had to go , and when Two Lance and Iron Feet did not appear , we knew they did this in anger for Chiefeagle 's scolding of them . Their horses were also gone , so the elders of the council pointed the finger of guilt at them and ordered the Akicita to hunt them down . " Turtleheart was still trying to convince himself that his grandfather would never speak to him again . Thinking of the lance , he brusquely asked , " They were found and punished ? " " No , the dog soldiers hunted them for many weeks with the best trackers , but the rain helped them get away . " Now she assured him , " They will be caught some day and made to pay for their deed . " " I must carry the lance for my Grandfather . It is a bad curse to have our honored and respected leader killed by his own people . Those responsible must die like a dog ! " He was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man said , " I see many unhappy years ahead for the Sioux . "  | This mid-summer was far different than the others Turtleheart had known . The bad signs were many , and the weather extremely hot and dry . The sage grass was not even a finger span long . The choke cherries were few and not yet fully formed . The few buffalo cows in the area were thin , not fat as they should be at this time of year . Everything was bad , and out of cycle for this season . The bad sign was even on the old men of the council . They often cast wisdom aside and entered into loud arguments . The dissension over even the smallest detail was a thing Turtleheart could not understand , and he grew to detest the wrangling of the elders . No longer able to stomach this way of doing things , Turtleheart fled the encampment . As he walked with long strides toward the last place of his beloved grandfather , his thoughts became more and more troubled . These were bewildering days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a time of life , he remembered , when the day was simple and uncluttered with the thoughts of white men . Now this life was becoming increasingly difficult , and the old ways seemed long distant . " What was it Chiefeagle used to . say ? Strangers bring fear . ' " The strangers were now getting to be many , as the leaves on a cottonwood . How does one stand up against those who are alien to our thoughts and actions ? How can you fight people whose ways are so strange ?  | Turtleheart did not attempt to answer his own questions , but he knew he could not stop in any struggle against these forced oppositions of the Sioux way of living . One does not give up in an easy manner when the land that abides with old memories is threatened . The beliefs he was born with and lived with he must defend with honor . In his heart he knew the way of the future would be long and bitter . He knew he must accustom himself to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burial rack of the old Sioux leader did he find a balance of mind and spirit . In the mute silence of the prairie he felt nearer to his grandfather and to the Great Mystery , the Father of all . Turtleheart slowly turned away and started back to camp . Standing in the path was the form of a broad , powerful man . He stood quietly , waiting for Turtleheart to complete his meditation before Chiefeagle 's burial rack . With the sign of friendship , the man stepped forward , his arrow case flapping against his thigh . As he stepped forward , Turtleheart noticed the black stripes across the bowed nose and broad cheeks . The stranger spoke after the clasp of hands , his voice deep and resonant . " After leaving the council fire of your elders , I went to your lodge , but you were gone . An old woman told me you had walked in this direction . You walk a fast pace . " With noble gestures the man signed respect for the dead , then continued , " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vision . His ability to heal the wounds of our people will be sorely missed . I do not speak of Chiefeagle with hollow words , but with the deepest feelings of my heart . " He placed his hand over his heart then signed the words for Wakan Tanka . " Since my return to the land of my forefathers , I have heard many voices speak of him , and all are good . Many words have been spoken in your favor , Turtleheart . You must carry on for your grandfather instructor . " " From one of your rank , your words are good to the ears ,  | but I do not remember you , " answered Turtleheart . " I can not place you among any of my relatives or friends . " " Accept my straightforwardness with an apology , " answered the warrior . A smile relaxed the stern features . " I am known as Strong Echo of the Good Voice band . For the past twelve winters I have been east of the great river . I have been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moons ago . " " When I first went to live the way of the white man , I believed I could raise myself to a higher plane of life . But when I tried their ways in their world , my life was empty . I also was not accepted . I was an Indian and not to be trusted . " Pausing , he rubbed his chin thoughtfully . " I do not blame them entirely , as my greatest obstacle was myself . The internal life of my being rebelled and would not change . My emotions were too deeply imbedded with my heritage , and because of this , I could not work for the white man . They called me an educated savage only because I would not accept their worship of money . " These words were slow in forming , as if he were trying to find justification for being born a Sioux . " Perhaps , Strong Echo , the one thing which brought you back was that which is called bitterness . Perhaps you failed the white man 's society because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct observation was tempered with a smile . " Yes , you are right . There is no doubt . But I returned for two personal reasons . I had lost the means of living close to Maka Ina , our mother earth . My spirit as I had known it was dead . " " Also I came back because of my mounting concern for my people . The public back to the east worry about the Indian wars . Their talking paper always spoke of these wars , and my hardship kept mounting because I was an Indian . My color and my heritage were my enemies . " " In search of more understanding , I joined the religion and went to their house of worship . But even here , the hunger of my inner self could find no refreshment . Perhaps that was  | because their beliefs were based on their way of life , I do not know . I felt that the only thing which had been left for me was the will of my inner self . " " This second reason I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives me a heavy heart . As you know , there has risen to the great detriment of our way of life , a different way of living . Like a dense cloud , it is spreading across our land , and already it is breathing on you . I know that most of you have not had as much as a light contact with the contour of this mighty way of life . I also know that I do not want my people to suffer the tragedies of the red man to the east . I do not want them oppressed . I do not want them forcibly marched to what they call the Oklahoma Territory on legs that are bending with the weight of too many tragedies . " " Turtleheart , you and I and the others must think about the possibility of being conquered . To submit is to change . We will have to find a way to adjust . " " I am glad to learn these things , Strong Echo . Perhaps our minds should dwell more on the possibilities of defeat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good that you have returned to help us . If we are to survive we must rely on each other and stop the quarrelling which has come over the elders . " In the long , slow walk back to the village , Turtleheart used the silence to think . This man who walked with him had a strong and honorable inner self . He was a good friend . Turtleheart stopped suddenly and with impulse asked , " Have you ever done the Sun Dance ? " Taken by surprise , Strong Echo looked at the younger man quizzically . " No , I have not . Why do you ask ? " " It would please me greatly if you would consent to be my sponsor and associate in the Sun Dance . I have not fulfilled my vow to do this dance and it has been almost a year since I made my promise . " " The time of the year when the clans gather together is now past , Turtleheart . The Sun Dance is always held at that time . How can you talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camps of the different bands have returned to their own areas ? Do you expect to send runners to the other bands and recall them for your Sun Dance ? " " I know that , Strong Echo . My grandfather told me the vow of the Sun Dance was sacred , and it should be held when the bands gathered in the early summer . But I was ill and unable to do it . It does not violate the sacred spirit of the dance if held later , and the rest of the Sioux bands need not be present . The important thing is that I have taken the vow to perform the Sun Dance within the summer following . " " Let us speak to Higheagle . If he approves we shall make haste to notify the chiefs to make preparations , " assented Strong Echo .  | The time for the Sun Dance was drawing near , and everyone in the village was preparing for the event . The inhabitants are always a part of the dance ceremony . Among the items needed were the presents for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dried buffalo part ; a supply of red , green , blue and yellow paint ; a red banner ; drums and sticks for the drummers ; the head of a newly killed buffalo ; and a covering for the dance lodge . All members of the camp were deployed to obtain these items . The site for this event had been previously selected on a level place near the banks of the White River , about four hundred yards from the camp . Turtleheart and Strong Echo , under instructions from Higheagle , the Yuwipi , were gathering the necessary trappings needed to complete their part of the dance . Each brought a deer skin , a red painted apron , a cape from the skin of the coot with the feathers attached , rabbit skin anklets , buffalo hair arm bands , a decorated eagle bone whistle and a willow hoop painted with the colors of the rainbow . When all of the articles had been procured , they were purified by Higheagle , who held them one by one over the fire of wild sage and sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of preparing for the dance , a council of chiefs and advisors was assembled . It was this council which selected the dance officials , the intercessors who would be in charge of the dance itself , and the Dog Soldiers , who would see that all of the rules were obeyed .  | The council was quite discriminating in appointing a man to the role of intercessor , since he represented the people in his prayers . If he is not a man of unquestioned integrity , the Great Holy might not answer his petitions . Even worse , there could be the possibility of a disaster befalling the people . The drummers , rattlers and singers were selected according to their skills , along with the diggers , whose job is to dig the hole for the pole used in the Sun Dance . The greatest caution is used in choosing the marshall and police , since they were to maintain discipline . The bands of Sioux who had been invited to the dance were now arriving , and were busy setting up their camps . Small groups of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for old acquaintances , exchanging bits of news , telling humorous stories , and boasting of their accomplishments . Turtleheart thought he recognized a familiar voice now and then , but the voice always moved on so quickly that he was never sure . His sense of curiosity made him long to go out into the camp , but custom required that dance candidates remain apart from camp activities . Higheagle could go out , but never did , and Turtleheart wondered why he did not . It could have been that Higheagle considered his withdrawal an expression of religious ethics . Turtleheart 's thoughts were interrupted by the appearance of a stranger in the doorway of the lodge . Of medium height and wide frame , he was conspicuous because of the deep and numerous wrinkles which covered his entire face and neck . His expression was one of triumph as he detected an air of non-recognition among those present . " Higheagle , can it be that your mind is getting too old to function ? " With this question , the stranger 's face broke into a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perplexity . " Highlance ? " His face relaxed . " Biglance . Yes . It has been many winters , many , many winters , since we last talked . " The stoic calm of both men was lost as they embraced each other laughingly.  | " Bring some hides for this poor old man , so he can set his carcass down in comfort , " ordered Higheagle . As this was being done , Higheagle pulled his pipe out of its beaded bag , filled it with tobacco , and lit it . Giving it to Biglance , the guest took it and drew a few casual puffs . " I must not tarry here much longer . I do not want them to interrupt you , Higheagle , and I do not want to be blamed for causing your mind to be confused . 1 would rather talk to you when we can laugh and joke . Yes , after the Sun Dance . " When Biglance reached the lodge entrance , he turned and apologetically announced , " This will cause you much sadness , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , they must be crazy in the head . " Higheagle could not control his laughter . " Why did n't you say so when you came in ? " " To be thrown out ? " Chuckling to himself , Biglance disappeared . Higheagle adjusted the tipi Hap after Biglance left , to seal out the beam of light , then turned to face the candidates . " Biglance is a very courageous man who has won many war honors , and he is highly respected by all of the elders . You are fortunate to have him as an intercessor . " " Knowing Biglance , he has already sent a scout to locate a live cottonwood tree . It will have to be straight and four times as long as a man 's outstretched arms . When he locates this tree , the scout will paint four red circles on the trunk to make it sacred . " " He will then report to Biglance and say that he found the enemy . And then , as you know , there will be a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finders will rope it and declare it captured . " The candidates had heard of this before , but they listened as if this was a new story . Higheagle was telling it with a great amount of vigor and action . " Four of the bravest Warriors will step up to the tree and strike it with ceremonial war clubs while telling of their bravest deeds . This will subdue the tree spirit . "  | The voice softened . " A young maiden , whose purity is above reproach , will come forward to fell the tree . As it falls , there will be much shouting and singing ; the warriors seeking the right to wear the black face paint , will sing songs to petition success in battle . " " Now all the limbs will be removed and red paint rubbed on the trunk . Expectant mothers will gather the twigs as a charm against the bad spirits . " The animation stopped and Higheagle changed the tone of his voice . We have our own things to do , so we must think of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who are to do the Sun Dance . The sweat lodge is being prepared now and tomorrow is the day for the sweat lodge ritual where you will cleanse your bodies . " Higheagle was still giving instructions when a voice came from outside the lodge . " Higheagle , please forgive the interruption but Biglance requests your presence at the dance area . The tree is being brought in . " " I will be on my way . " In a soft tone , Higheagle turned his comments back to the dance pole . " It has been lifted on sticks and is being brought in by the chosen ones . Enroute to the dance area , they will make three stops and a medicine man will howl like a wolf each time . You will soon be able to hear the procession sing as they follow the pole . And you will also hear the medicine man as he drives the evil spirits from the camp . " With an air of expectancy , he turned and left . The night was warm and Turtleheart 's thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smile as he thought of his first experience with the sweat lodge , one which he was allowed to help build . The lodge was about as high as the average warrior , its hive-shaped frame made by sticking the large ends of willows into the ground and tying them at the . tops . The first willows were always placed to the east and formed the entrance . The next two were to the west , then two were placed on the north and last on the south . The green sticks were bent to be tied over the center of the lodge . He had been so excited at being  | allowed to help , that he was careless in tying them together . The hoots of derisive laughter rang again in his ears as he remembered how the willow sticks pulled loose and suddenly snapped upright , just when the old men were trying to throw the buffalo skins over them . As sleep gradually overtook Turtleheart , the thoughts grew dimmer and dimmer , but the smile still lingered on his face . The morning gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure to be a test of human endurance . " This thing is good , " quipped Turtleheart . " The sweat will roll on this day . " They all laughed at his remark , happy to see Turtleheart smile as he used to do . Turtleheart was still smiling as they approached the sweat lodge . Each candidate removed his breechclout , entered , and turned to his left to go around the lodge , the first one in stopping just before reaching the entrance again . In the center was the familiar square hole , about the length of a man 's arm across and deep . A bucket-shaped hide filled with water was near the hole . A buffalo tail brush and sweet grass was handed into the holy Yuwipi man and the entrance was closed to seal out the light . The outside noises were muffled and the inside was dark . Turtleheart could just make out the naked forms of the others . As he turned his thoughts to the ceremony , a medicine drum echoed with the drummers thudding beat . The voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice and drum stopped abruptly , it was deathly quiet . The voice of the Yuwipi man startled Turtleheart as he began his chant . The sacred words of the chant were sung four times before he stopped to light the pipe . Taking four draws , the holy number , he handed the pipe to his left . Strong Echo carefully accepted it and took four puffs before handing it to the left . The pipe was sent around the circle , each drawing the required number of four puffs until it reached the last man . He handed it back to the one on his right , who passed it on  | without smoking it . Reaching the Yuwipi , Higheagle repeated what he had done before , he took four puffs before handing the pipe to the one on his left . After this procedure was repeated four times , the pipe was laid on the altar . " The hot rocks , " Turtleheart said to himself . " It is time to call for them . " And that is just what Higheagle did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed them into the pit . The Yuwipi chanted a prayer as he took the tail of the buffalo and sprinkled the first rock with water . As the steam rose from the pit , each one silently assessed his ability to stand what he knew was coming . This taste of heat was only the beginning . This first rock was for Wakan Tanka . The next two would be for Father Sun and Mother Earth . They would be followed by seven more rocks for the seven council fires , plus more , until the pit was filled . The sinister sound of rattles sent shivers running up the backs of the participants , even though they knew it was next to come . With this sound of the rattles , the priest of the purification rite began another chant . Interposed in the chant were melodic phrases extolling secret symbols ; words that had been handed down from generation to generation . Each time Higheagle dipped the buffalo tail into the water and sprinkled the hot stones , the heat became more intense . Now the pungent smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willows grew overpowering . The air was so thick it was getting harder and harder to breathe . The chanting prayers were interrupted so Higheagle could ask his relatives in the spirit world to pray for the cleansing of mind and body so they would be pure for the Sun Dance . All of the men took turns to present their prayers , and it was now Turtleheart 's turn . He closed his eyes and began to chant to the Great Holy . He hoped to avoid being overcome by the heat and aroma by concentrating on his prayers . He must forget himself and think only of what was to be done . He was so engrossed he no longer tried to wipe his body with the sweet grass .  | After the last rock had been placed and water sprinkled over it , the heat became unbearable . Turtleheart felt of his slick , wet hair ; he placed his hands flat on his chest and pressed downward . The perspiration ran in rivulets from his skin , to disappear in the grass covering the floor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous and monotonous rhythm . The silence was overpowering . Higheagle arose , threw aside the flap and stepped outside . The other participants rose one by one to go to the right so as to keep from crossing the entrance . It was a bad sign if anyone should cross it from the left . With Higheagle leading them , the occupants of the lodge quickly ran down to the river and plunged into its icy waters . The naked bodies glinted in the sun as they ran . Turtleheart was surprised that he did not feel cramped after the long hours of sitting . His muscles felt relaxed and his bones felt like green sticks that bent with every step . The sudden immersion in water strangely caused no shock and he felt completely at rest . Walking up the slope of the bank of the river , Turtleheart turned to stand and look into the water . He saw the wavering reflection of a tall , lithe and well-built figure looking back at him . Jumping like a young colt horse , he went to pick up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rancid smell taken by the spirit of the waters , he must remain in a spiritual cleanliness until the dance . The building of the Sun Dance lodge was completed during the sweat lodge ritual , and Biglance was scattering incensed sweet grass around the center . It was now a sacred place . At the outer edge of the dance area , shade was provided by stretching evergreen branches and robes over forked sticks . The entrance was to the south , and was partially blocked by a new tipi where the candidates would make their last minute preparations for the dance . In the center of the area was the hole dug to receive the " enemy " pole . Behind it was the altar prepared by cutting out  | a large square of grass down to the virgin soil . While this was being done , Biglance sang a chant four times . " Four times I pray to the earth ; a place I will prepare , oh tribe , behold . " Almost immediately after the chant , there was a piercing cry of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given by the others . The drummers bent to their drumming with enthusiasm . The flutes with plaintive notes and eagle bone whistles combined in a shrill , tumultous noise designed to run away the bad spirits . Higheagle had already escorted the two candidates to the preparation lodge , where they would remain until they started the ordeal which was fast approaching . The sun was getting low in the sky when the silent signal was given . Biglance and the other officials led the people in a circle around the camp area four times , the chants echoing down the river bottom . Another signal for silence and the feast was announced ready . The old , the orphans and the poor were fed first . The others had to wait until this was done . During the festivities which followed , the poor received gifts . The rest of those present would receive gifts during the giveaway dances . At sundown , Biglance and Higheagle left the noise of the camp behind to go to the top of a nearby hill where they held the pipe to Wakan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he provided the light and warmth for the things on earth . They offered it to the earth because that is where the food and clothing come from . They offered the pipe to the east , the west , the north and the south , because they were the homes of the four winds . The whole ceremony was a prayer for the people . Throughout the night the old men would shake their rattles and chant . The old women gathered up the wood and twigs for the fires . The sub-ordinate medicine men wound their way all through the camp to keep the evil spirits at bay .  | As the first rays of sunshine tinged the early morning sky , Biglance led his assistants to the dance lodge to make the final preparations for the three days of the Sun Dance . First he began preparing the place of the Sun Dance pole , by placing sage grass and sweet grass on the bottom of the hole . These objects symbolized the offering of mind and spirit to the Author of Supernatural Powers . Next , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ token of the good things of life . As intercessor he made ready the Sun Dance fetish . Four wands of choke cherry wood , a wisp of sage grass , a bunch of sweet grass , a bit of buffalo hair . Rising to one knee , he imparted to the fetish the potency of the Buffalo Spirit with a whispered prayer . This fetish was tied to one of the two branches left at the top of the pole . Silently , Biglance extended his hand and one of his assistants produced another bundle of charms tied with a thin strip of buffalo hide . Another gave him a small figure of a man and one of a buffalo . Both were of buffalo hide and painted black . The intercessor imparted to these figures the potency of Iya and power of Gnaski . These were all tied to the top of the pole . On the second branch of the pole he tied a red colored skin made from the hide of a deer . Four strong ropes woven from the tail hair of the horse , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Four men grasped these ropes and the pole was lifted into position , the earth carefully tramped into place at the base .  | Biglance stepped up to the pole and speaking for it , he sang , " Sacred I stand ; behold me . It is said for me that I stand watchful at the center of the earth ; stand watchful , while praying for the people . " The Akicita was waiting outside of the arena , and they were ordered to drive the obscenity from the camp . They did this by riding around the pole and shooting down the figures . The onlookers were now many and they trampled the fallen figures into the ground . Raising his arms in prayer , the confusion of the moment ceased , and Biglance chanted a prayer to the Great Holy , as he placed a dried buffalo part and a pipe at the base of the pole . The pipe was to maintain decency among the people and the buffalo part symbolized the perpetuation of the Tetonwan . As Biglance completed the last of the rites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet painted red by Higheagle . A blue stripe was painted across the shoulders of each . Higheagle asked for the totems of the two and receiving no answer , rapidly drew a cloud on Strong Echo 's chest and a turtle on Turtleheart . Throughout this procedure , not a word was spoken . Now Higheagle held up a bowl of mud and looked questioningly at the two . They remained silent , so he discarded it . Had one of them decided to be released from the vow of the Sun Dance , he would have smeared mud on his hair , arms and legs . Chanting softly , Higheagle hung the red colored breechclouts on each man . He attached the wrist bands and the anklets , fastened sage and sticks into their hair . Handing them each a staff , he stepped back for an appraisal . " Ho , you look fit enough to fulfill your vows , but this performance is going to take more than just good looks . Finish and you will know great satisfaction . Fail and you will be given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My relatives , everything is in readiness . There are four other dancers waiting outside right now . You will follow me and they will follow you . I have spoken . "  | Higheagle stooped to pick up a buffalo skull from near the entrance , threw the flap open and stepped out . With a motion for the others to follow , he took long , slow , deliberate steps to lead the dancers into the bowery . In the language of signs , the dancers were told to sit on the beds of sage grass . Continuing to the altar , Higheagle approached it four times before placing the skull of the buffalo upon it . The drummers and singers slowly entered the arena , the spectators following at a distance . By the time everybody had taken his place a fire of sage was burning on the altar , and Higheagle was purifying articles in its smoke . Tension was beginning to mount as the spectators were straining to observe all of the things which were going on . The pipe was lit by Biglance , four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his left . Thus signalled the end of Higheagle 's duties . Biglance , the Intercessor , was in charge . A murmur was heard from the watchers as the drumming roll of the great ceremonial drum began . All six dancers , eager to begin , jumped to their feet to fall in line . Side by side they faced the sun , their arms raised in its direction . The drum became silent , the dancers lowered their arms , hands along the thighs . Biglance walked with ceremony down the line of dancers and thrust eagle bone whistles into their mouths . Stopping at the last dancer , Biglance clenched his fist , and with a sudden movement , brought his fist across his chest in an arc . The drummers took the cue and to the accompaniment of many rattles , the dance started . Turtleheart 's heart raced as he kept time to the drum beat , raising himself onto the balls of his feet and dropping to the heels . The up and down action of the dancers was in perfect time to the rhythm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagle bones was piercing to the ears . The monotony of the movement , plus the sounds of the dance , cast an eerie spell . No word was spoken by the dancers as they kept up without break all morning , their eyes mere slits as they looked at  | the sun . Biglance kept pacing in front of them , offering words of encouragement . As the sun reached its zenith , the spectators who kept drifting back and forth from the dance , all came back to see the dancers rest and to yell their words of approval . Commanded to lie down by Biglance , the dancers were only too willing to comply . A short rest was welcome . As they lay on the couches , Biglance spewed water from his mouth upon them and an attendant gave them small bowls of dog broth . The rest interval was short and the dancers were soon back to their bobbing step to keep on until the setting of the sun . After a full day of the dance , the men were unsteady in their walk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the dance by the intercessor . Although very tired from their exertion , they could not lay their tired bodies down until given permission by Biglance . To stumble and fall would bring cries of derision and they would be taunted as women . At the end of the second day there was no pretense of toughness of body . The candidates simply dropped in their tracks from exhaustion . At the end of this day the women relatives were allowed to help them to their couches . As the sun approached its high point on the third day , the excitement of the people was rampant . After the short rest , the dancers were going to give of the body . They had already given of the spirit and the long awaited command by Biglance for the " tying up " was greeted with absolute silence . The warriors of the Buffalo Society had been performing the buffalo dance a short distance away , and now they came running into the dance area . In simulated battle charge , their weapons were brandished with vigorous enthusiasm . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stalked by a hideously painted character with a war lance . Another was attacked with the tomahawk . A third wards off the flashing blade of a knife . The howls , the cries , the savage gestures were impressive and the watchers gave forth with loud whoops of pleasure at the show .  | Turtleheart and the others were soon captured and thrown to the ground with no evidence of gentleness , to await the torture . After a short dance of victory , the Buffalo Warriors consulted among themselves about the manner of torture selected by the individual dancers . The upper left arm of the first dancer was gashed fifty times with a sharp knife . The second dancer had pledged thirty gashes ; the third , forty gashes . The fourth dancer had pledged one hundred and twenty cuts . Fifty on each arm was his share , the remaining cuts to be accepted by the women of his family . The scarring ceremony was anti-climaxed by the smoking of the medicine pipe . Each of the four dancers took four puffs as the pipe was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe they were dismissed . With their arms over the shoulders of their relatives , they walked half supported , with stumbling steps . Collapsing to the ground out of the area , their wounds were treated by the medicine man . The cost of treatment depended upon the wealth of the family . The ends of the horse hair ropes hanging from the pole were being split by the Buffalo Warriors . The split strands had to be long enough to reach the ends of the wooden skewers which would be inserted through the flesh of Turtleheart and Strong Echo . The pointed sticks made from the wood of the wild cherry were in place on special pads to keep them holy . The hushed quiet was disturbed by the rolling beat on the drum . The sounds of the turtleshell rattles seemed vague . The time for the supreme torture of the Sun Dance was at hand . The air of the hot day seemed charged with the arrows of lightning and as the tormentors dropped to their knees , one expected to hear the roll of thunder come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buffalo Society drew his awl , and with much ceremony presented it to the four winds . He bent over the prostrate Turtleheart and grasped the flesh of the chest just above the nipple with his teeth . When he felt that the flesh was numb , he deftly forced the bone awl through  | the muscle to form two punctures . The blood was running freely when the skewer was inserted into the wound . Involuntarily , Turtleheart closed his eyes . He again closed his eyes when the same procedure followed on the other side . The medicine man went to Strong Echo and Turtleheart felt the blood going down his abdomen . After the skewers had been inserted through the flesh of Strong Echo , the candidates were motioned to rise by Biglance . Led to the pole , the skewers were attached to the rope . Biglance gave each of them a few elm leaves for sustenance and a lance . As Biglance raised the pipe to the Great Holy , the drumming ceased . After the invocation the pipe was offered to Turtleheart , who really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smoke appeared four times and the pipe was given back to Biglance , who now offered it to Strong Echo . From the lips of the singers came the words of a sacred chant . The bodies of the watchers began to sway in cadence and from the throng could be heard the sounds of dull bells as many feet kept time with the rhythm of the drumming . Securely fastened , Turtleheart began to pull steadily backward . The flesh of his breasts resembled two bloody horns . Strong Echo was jumping wildly about with the motions of a wounded animal . By mid-afternoon , the singers had completed all of the twenty-four sacred songs of the Sun Dance and were starting on the second round . Sharp , searing pains stabbed through Turtleheart 's chest . The weight of a buffalo robe was upon the ropes holding him to the pole . He fell to one knee in agonizing anguish , his thoughts whirled as he barely heard a woman 's voice . " In my small way , my son , I have tried to help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerk spasmodically against the restraining rope . Blood streamed into his breechclout and perspiration poured from every pore of his body . He jerked and felt one of the skewers tear loose . An awed silence fell upon the crowd as he fell to both knees , unable to rise .  | He must tear loose from the other skewer . Knowing that the longer he stayed on his knees , the harder it would be to get up , he forced himself upright while feeling great pride that no outcry had passed his lips . In one instant his body stiffened , his arms jerked and he was free . His mind was strangely clear , but his body crumpled to the earth , completely sapped of strength . He was free , free ! He had preserved his honor . The thunderous roar of approval increased in volume . Biglance announced that the last skewer had been broken . Both men were free ! This was a good omen . It was the fulfillment of the vow !  | Arriving in St. Louis with the Callahans , Evensigh was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shy way , she made no effort to conceal her surprise at the beautiful carpets , the ornamental chandeliers , the pillars , and her fright at the first ascension up the wide stairway . Shown to her room , she explored it like a delighted child . Smelling the draperies , laying on the canopied bed and fondling its covers , she was in a dream world . The many bars of soap fascinated her with their fragrance and she bit into one . Making a wry , funny face , she quickly spat it out . As Evensigh became familiar with her new way of life , she soon realized that the life of a white woman such as this did not require the physical strength of a Sioux woman . There were other differences too ; the customs , the attitudes , the patterns of habit . Her first impulse was to reject this life . However , Evensigh earnestly tried to learn and understand what was going on . The differences were great and she spent many months adjusting . Mrs. Callahan was very understanding and patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress properly ; to set the table and cook ; how to dance and curtsy , and the many other things important to the people of St. Louis . At the end of her first year , she spoke English well enough to be included at the dinner parties the Callahans had . She was a naturally sensitive girl and at these functions she could feel rather than see that there were many who were jealous of the Callahan family .  | Really , she told herself , the people here were no different than those at home . If they were lazy and worthless , they had little . If they were brave and had honor they were highly respected . Evensigh and Mrs. Callahan spent many hours together when Mr. Callahan was away on his many business trips , and the two women grew very fond of each other in the way of women who can understand another 's feelings . " You are very much like my mother at home , " Evensigh said one evening . " You are very kind and thoughtful of others , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Callahan rose from her chair and gave the girl a warm hug . " You could not have pleased me more if you were my own daughter , Julie , who died so long ago . You are just as I always hoped she would be . " Her eyes were misty , and the two women embraced each other as mother and daughter . Evensigh had come to think of herself as the Callahan 's daughter . It startled her to realize she had become a white person . She kept reminding herself that she must not forget her past life . Nothing could change what had happened , and it was important to her . She must keep her Indian thoughts in a closed part of her mind , and make a determined effort to face the reality of the present . At night her dreams gave her away . She thought Sioux and cried out Sioux words . In the spring following her arrival , Mr. Callahan brought a young man , Michael Peterson , home to dinner . He worked for Mr. Callahan 's firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was Evensigh 's escort to the concert after dinner , and the two of them spent a most enjoyable evening . Seeing that Evensigh was attracted to the young man , Mrs. Callahan managed to invite him to their home many times . " My , Michael is squiring you everywhere these days , is n't he ? " Mrs. Callahan asked . " Yes , he does . He is very considerate and understanding , and he knows that I like him very much . "  | " You still think of Turtleheart , " the frankness in her voice was not unkind , but sincere . While she had kept the memory of Turtleheart locked in her mind , Evensigh never thought of replacing him with another . The idea drained her cheeks of color . " Please . Please excuse me , " she said hurriedly . In her room she felt disloyal to the memory of her loved one . Mrs. Callahan did know her secret and in a way she was glad . It takes courage to salvage a dream . She realized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . The memory was sweet , but it was just a memory , no more or no less . Michael Peterson was a constant caller at the Callahan home . He brought flowers ; or a book ; occasionally a box of candy . He did not question Evensigh about her former life , but respected her inner thoughts and steered the conversation of the others away from it . As they strolled through the Callahan garden one hot summer night , Evensigh asked him to sit down so she could talk . She told him about Turtleheart and his tragic death , and about her love for him . It was hard to tell Michael , but she felt it was his right to know her true feelings , even at the risk of a beautiful friendship . There was a short , awkward silence as Michael was trying to grasp at ideas to ease the situation . Not meaning to say what he did , he asked , " Were you married against your will ? " " Of course not , why do you say that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know . It 's just ... Well , I guess I have heard stories about Indian girls and all of that . " " Oh Michael , " she fussed . " That is not true . You must not believe all of the stories you hear . " Seeing the consternation on his face , she had to laugh . " To marry an Indian girl , a man has to have the consent of her parents . If they accept his present of a robe or something , he is acceptable if she desires him . If she rejects the robe , he gets it back . " She shrugged her shoulders as if to say that was all there was to it .  | " The groom has to prove himself to the family then ? " " Yes , if he has honor , is generous , is brave and comes from a good family , then he will provide a good home for his wife and will be a good father for his children . " She paused then added , " His family should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which shows they have good thoughts of the forthcoming marriage . " She rose and held onto Michael 's hand as they walked to a little pond . " Michael , my grandmother has often told me that if you stand very still before sunrise , before the morning star has stolen away , that you can hear nature . Do you believe that ? I do . You can feel it in your whole body . " " Your thoughts are most beautiful and I must say , you are right . That is the quietest part of the day . " Taking a deep breath , he asked , " Were you happy in the Indian world ? " " Yes . I have to say yes . Our way was different . As a girl , the Sioux is trained to be the mother of the band . She can cook , dry foods , tan hides , make clothing , do beadwork , make a fine home for her children . A good woman is very valuable and the man depends upon her . To marry a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You are a very remarkable and sweet girl , Evensigh . If only the others had the honest and sincere personality that you possess . " The next day , a parcel from the most expensive shop in St. Louis arrived for Evensigh . Inside was a beautifully designed friendship ring and with it , a card with the penciled words , " To my Indian Princess , with love , Mike .  | The summer of 1875 had been extremely hot and dry . Now , blizzards swept across the high plains , as the bitter cold of a very early winter enveloped the area . Rations were very scarce , even among the Indians camped near the agency . Abiding by the insistent demands of the people , Higheagle called a council of the chiefs . Among those asked to attend were Turtleheart and Strong Echo . On the dark , wind swept night before the council was to be held , the hungry populace congregated around the lodge of Higheagle , in the hope that some action would soon be taken to alleviate the growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the council members began to arrive . They seated themselves around the center fire with their robes pulled around their shoulders . Their position depended upon the rank held , and as Turtleheart and Strong Echo were newcomers , they were given a place in back of the established leaders . Higheagle arose to address them . " Without doubt , many serious problems have been abusing your mind . The biggest problem which is in our minds is the fact that we are without food . The children cry and the old ones weep . If something is not done soon , we shall starve . " He spoke the last statement with extreme emphasis , then paused . " The land has become a barren place and the white men have done nothing . It would seem they mean to destroy us . They gave enough food to feed children and that did nothing but weaken our bodies and our spirits . We are only half alive . Even our ponies starve and  | can not travel far , for they only have dry , weightless grass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat our horses . " Strong Echo rose from his position and asked permission to speak . " Men of the council , we can not exist as men anytime , because we are only half free . This fact weighs on all of our minds , and I think every man should speak his thoughts . That way , we might find an answer . " Nods of approval and words of encouragement gave Strong Echo added strength , so he spoke in a bolder tone . " By treaty we are required to live on the reservation . But this treaty gives us the right to hunt elsewhere , even beyond the Paha Sapa , our sacred ground . All we need to do is notify the agent of our need to hunt there , and according to the treaty , he can not oppose us . Our people are starving . Some of the old ones have already walked off into the prairie to die , so as to leave their share of food for the children . This is a bitter way for a proud people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are against us . I know that they do not all feel this way , but they must follow the orders of their leaders . Many of them are good people and try to help us , but those in charge know that what they do will weaken us . When we are broken like a stick , they will take what we have left , and move us to the Indian Territory down to the south . " The voice of the crier was heard , telling the people what was being said , as Strong Echo paused for a deep breath . " I have been waiting , " he resumed , " to tell you of what I read in the white man 's written language . This was written thirtyfive winters ago by a man named Catlin . He said on this paper , that thirty million white men are fighting over the bones of twelve million red men , six million of whom have fallen victim of the smallpox , the dread disease of the white man . " " I was born an Indian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road of the white skin . I am telling you that the problems we have now will catch up the white man when he is unaware . I have spoken with my heart . "  | The silence following Strong Echo 's words was broken by many comments of praise and assent . The chieftains now looked in surprise at Turtleheart , as he had given the sign for recognition . His honor and bravery was well known , but for a youth who has had no real experience to want to speak ? They were curious as to what this young man might have to say . " For too long I have rubbed the oil on my impatience . Many are suffering because we have been surrounded as the buffalo by the white men . Nothing is left of our spirits to warm the darkness of our lives . " Turtleheart was nervous and his voice was strained , but with some effort , he tried to speak in a normal way . " Out of respect for you with greater wisdom than I , I have suppressed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the Paha Sapa . " The earnestness of Turtleheart 's thoughts gave him the courage to continue . " I , too , have suffered hunger , and that I can endure , but to hear the children cry for food , the old ask for meat , tears my heart in two pieces . Can we do nothing but sit on our haunches and warm the earth ? " " Have we forgotten that strength comes from use ? We must be like the young eagle which was driven from its nest by the mother eagle . We too , must strengthen our wings by flying . We must go on the hunt . " Turtleheart 's throat was dry from nervousness . " My relations with the white man assure me that he will not give us back our land . My words are harsh , but my heart tells me that the white leaders are speaking with a forked tongue in making promises to give us hope . If you believe this , I reject you . I will lead my band to the hunting grounds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other for emphasis , he concluded with , " What I have to say is strong , but if I am wrong you will have to prove what you say . " Crazy Horse was on his feet before any of the surprised elders could recover . Without the recognition of Higheagle ,  | he burst out , " Your words are good words and spoken with the good spirit . I am with you . I can not stay here and die . To die in war is honor , but to fade away with the sunset is to be a coward . That is all . " Higheagle gave the sign for silence as Iron Shield rose . " It is good to hear a man of your bravery , Crazy Horse , but this is a council of honor . " The stern words of Higheagle were as a command . " Iron Shield , you may speak your mind . " " You have spoken the thoughts of a wise man , Turtleheart . I , Iron Shield , look around me , and from what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in agreement . We can no longer be slaves of the white man 's ways . " The remainder of the meeting was dedicated to the plans of carrying out the means of accomplishing that which had been agreed upon . When free to leave , Turtleheart hurried to the lodge of his grandmother . " A messenger is being sent to the agency , Grandmother , to tell them of our intentions to go to the hunting grounds on the Powder River . " " That is good , my grandson . We have waited a long time for that news . How soon do we leave ? " " Early in the morning , grandmother . " " Bring two horses and I will start to pack . " Turtleheart smiled as he said , " Strong Echo is on his way with them . " " Did he speak at the council ? " " He gave a strong talk , one that opened many eyes . But his heart is sad . " " Ah ? " " Yes . He feels he has been abandoned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the children . He is to move them to the agency after we have gone . " At the sound of Strong Echo 's approach with the horses , Turtleheart stepped out into the cold night . Strong Echo handed the ropes of the horses to Turtleheart and complained , " I was counting on hanging at your moccasins , my friend , but my pleading was ignored . "  | " Strong Echo , a strong man of your talents is needed . I am sure Higheagle selected you because of your great wisdom of the white man 's ways and tongue . You will help dispel the fears of our people who are going to the agency . Your mission is more important than mine , old friend . " " Your words are of comfort , but it was my great desire to take part in the buffalo hunt . " " Higheagle is a man of great wisdom , and he knows that if the hunt fails and we are unable to come back , no one else could help our people better than you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why was Red Cloud absent from the council ? I understood he was to be present . " " On my last trip to the agency I had a long talk with him . He told me he would not come ; his band was faring better at the agency . He said he was sending his spirit of support even though he had grown weary of letting the hatchet fall on his people . He said that the wars always ended in treaties , and that treaties are not understood by red men . " Strong Echo shook his head at Red Cloud 's reasoning . " He is a good man , but torn between paths . He still believes in the language of the treaties and is sad when they are broken . I have deep sympathy for Red Cloud . " " He is truly a noble man , Strong Echo , but his memory is growing fogged with age . Like a child he is persuaded into thinking that freedom is to live like the white man . I prefer to be free to hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vision which gives me strength of spirit . This is the freedom Red Cloud has forgotten . " " Freedom means many things to many people , Turtleheart . Our freedom is our way of life , but to others it could be a different thing . " " I must go . " He grimaced to show that while he did not like Higheagle 's orders , he would still obey . With no further word , he disappeared into the darkness . " Grandson , step inside . I have something which you should have . " The voice of his grandmother called from the tipi.  | In a lighter mood , Turtleheart stuck his head inside of the flap and quipped , " You do ? For me ? " " Do not stand there like a clown , " she pretended annoyance . " You are letting in the cold and I am the one who hauls the wood . " " Here is the winter count which your grandfather started many years ago . It is yours now . He asked me to give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the record . " Her voice now choked at recalling the details leading up to the death of her husband . " This is the proper time . You are now our leader . " The old woman slowly handed Turtleheart two rolls of tanned hide , as she explained further . " This smaller winter count is your own personal calendar which your grandfather kept for you since the time he found you . " " I had forgotten about it , until I unrolled the band winter count and found it inside . " Turtleheart 's eyes were shining with pride as he unrolled the smaller tube of elk hide to study its symbols . Allowing his thoughts to go back over the years , he remembered many of the events the pictures portrayed . " I shall take care of it grandmother , great care of it . He was a wise leader , and his winter count must be preserved . " " He told me it was to be very valuable to you , and that you must continue the story it tells . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one knows how much this means to me . " He rolled the smaller of the two winter counts carefully inside of the other and left the lodge . Outside were two boys helping pack his grandmother 's belongings , and after giving them some instructions to follow , Turtleheart left them to make the final preparations for the hunting trip . Soon , scouts were sent ahead to break the trail for the long journey to the country of the Powder River .  | Making rapid time in spite of the . difficulties of bad weather , the caravan , under Turtleheart 's leadership , was traveling through the area southeast of the Powder River in what is now Wyoming , within a moon 's time . Devil 's Tower was to the north and the Black Hills were to their backs in the east . The trip was uneventful except for the merciless weather . The vicious winter storms howled about their thin garments and turned the skin blue . Two braves were with Turtleheart as the trail ahead was scouted . The enforced stay on the reservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the miserable weather , they were rejoicing to be able to roam unfettered . The remarkable fragrance of the woods was in his nostrils , and the unfrozen spots of water in the streams seemed exceptionally clear . He wondered if this was the reason why the story tellers referred to these streams as Medicine Water ' ! Everything seemed beautiful . Even the snow that looked so threatening a few days ago , charmed him now with its bluish hue . Thus was the mystery of Wakan Tanka , and these are the signs of His veiled presence . What was it Higheagle had said ? " You have to know just what you are , in order to feel Him through nature . It is only through nature that one can gain communion with the Holy Mystery . " " Look . The open spot ahead ! And the one to the right ; and close to the horizon . Look ! " The excited shouts of the scout ahead broke the thoughts of Turtleheart.  | " Straighten my arrows ! That is a band of buffalo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Let us go and get fresh meat for our relatives . " " I will ride ahead to scout for a cliff to drive them over . " " No , no , " answered Turtleheart . " Look closely , they are on the move . We must strike now . " " Hee-YAAAH ! " was the yell on their lips as the three men descended on the herd with their horses at full gallop . The sudden noise confused two full grown cows into colliding with each other . Both were shot while still off balance , and they collapsed where they stood . The remainder of the shaggy beasts were now alarmed , and with tremendous speed and power , they were on the move . The scouts were after them as the buffalo plunged wildly into the open , heads down and tails up . Dashing madly ahead , Turtleheart glanced to his left to see a young amber colored bull . He aimed and fired and the animal , which showed four winters of life , veered unsteadily then plunged down , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for end in a cloud of dusty snow . Quickly surveying the undulating sea of humps , Turtleheart selected the , largest beast near him as his next victim . Dropping his single shot rifle , he snatched the lance hanging from the side of his pony . Pushing his horse to greater speed , it was now difficult to see clearly through the white fog of snow . He guided his horse in between the shaggy animals until he raced neck and neck with his intended prey , terror in its eyes . Turtleheart could see the slithering tongue as it ran with a mighty will to live . With all the power in his arm and shoulder , he drove the lance deep into the brown body . Enraged , the animal did not give him time to withdraw his lance , and lunged at the horse with its huge head and horns . The breath of the pony knocked out , the buffalo and the horse went down in a tangle of bodies and legs . Turtleheart  | leaped clear , with a desperate effort , and landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , Turtleheart was on his back , eager to get going before the rest of the herd ran them down . Looking for the lanced buffalo , the hunter saw him nearby . He was moving , but with considerable unsteadiness , as the lance was pulled out and thrust home again . This stopped the wounded animal , and the rest of the herd thundered on by . As Turtleheart dismounted from his horse with a Hying leap , the buffalo fell with a thud . The other scouts raced up shouting , " This is like the old days , eh ? We got three of them , and it is a good feeling . How many did you get ? " " Two . " " Five in all . We will feast for the next few days . A day of rest and a belly full of food will be good . " " Come , let us cut these buffalo . " stated Turtleheart . " We have work to do before we eat . " With the satisfaction of a full stomach , Turtleheart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late at night and he was taking his turn at watch in the crotch of a tree overlooking the camp . The people were fast asleep and this made him feel good . They deserved the chance to rest without the gnawing pangs of hunger . A man 's song of thanks drifted up softly from the camp , and Turtleheart knew this was the song of relief . The good feeling was to be disturbed the next day . The scouts rode into camp reporting they had seen about thirty of the horse soldiers with some Indian scouts who were probably Crow . They were only a half day 's travel from the camp and were coming closer . With some haste , the camp leaders assembled for a council , and the leader of the scouts told of what he had seen . As Turtleheart listened thoughtfully , he was making plans . He rose to speak when the scout had finished his story .  | " My relations , this has been a truly hard and trying journey . It was long , but successful . We thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be ambushed , but now , after we have camped , the scouts bring word of horse soldiers and our old enemy , the Crow . " " Before you clog your minds with what we must do , " Higheagle interjected , " I wish to say that Turtleheart 's leadership deserves our highest praise . " The answer to this was many " hous " . " Hear me , my relations , " the slow and resonant voice of Crazy Horse silenced the men . " We have just emerged from a storm of suppression where we were supposed to be sustained by the agency . We were hungry there , but today we are not hungry . We can step outside and feel the many deep spirits of the past , return . Our heritage reminds us that the Sioux life came from the earth , and should be nourished by the earth . We now talk of preserving this heritage . The sensible step toward the preservation of our hand is to move on into the valleys of the Tongue and Rosebud Rivers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the warm weather returns . Then we can move into the valley of the Greasy Grass for our annual reunion of the members of the seven council fires . " " An excellent idea , Crazy Horse , and well spoken . Is there anyone here who is unwilling to put his faith in the suggestion of Crazy Horse ? " There were no words of disagreement , so all went out to begin the task of breaking camp . Along the river of the Rosebud , the hand found life peaceful , and they gladly resumed the old way of life . In the many lodges there was always plenty of meat and warmth . At night the inhabitants of the lodges sat around the fires and spoke of the lore of their forefathers . They laughed and talked of the Red Cloud Agency as though it were a nightmare of long ago . It was on one of these nights that Turtleheart escorted a runner from the Indian Agency into camp . They were astonished to see a frost-covered rider who appeared hardly strong enough to sit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Higheagle 's presence , he remarked , " Well , if it is n't one of the agency Indians , one of the Loafer band . You look ill . Sit down and have some hot broth to revive you . " " I am not ill , but I am very tired . The long journey to here has made me tired to the bones . I carry a message to you from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs . You are to move back to a place within the reservation . You must be there by the end of January on the white man 's calendar . If you do not , you will be treated as an enemy . " " What day of the calendar is this ? " Higheagle was greatly disturbed at hearing the words of this Loafer . " Let me count the sticks I have in my pouch . Each one is for a different day of travel . " With this , he emptied a small bag of its contents and he and Higheagle counted . " There are twenty-six of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendar did you leave ? " " I left on the day of December twenty-second , the same day the message was received by the Indian Agent . The storms and bitter cold slowed my journey , and there were many times I thought I would not find you . " " Then , what day is this in the white man 's count ? " The two bent their heads to figure this problem , and when it became apparent that this was already the seventeenth of January , Higheagle shook his head . " We can not return by the fourteen days time . " " This is another deliberate attempt to declare war on us . This will give the agent a reason to turn us over to the horse soldiers . " With these words of anger , Crazy Horse stalked out of the lodge . " After you have rested , you can exchange your horse for another to go back and tell the long knives that we can not do the impassible . " A wave of the hand by Higheagle , and he excused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived at the camp a few days later , to find the people in a mood of dejec- tion . Being told about the message they were also much concerned , as they had received a similar message while camping on the west fork of Beaver Creek . Turtleheart doubled his force of scouts and dispatched them as far as he dared . They were to keep a sharp lookout for the arrival of blue coats in the area . Days and weeks passed without event , and the weather was too bad to allow any movement of the camp . Early one morning , during a Cheyennes . They informed the scout that there were only a few left of their band . They had been camping in the bottom of the Powder River . They were extended the hand of friendship and invited to come into the camp to tell their story of woe . They had been attacked by soldiers while they were asleep in their lodges . They told of the terror of being awakened by gunshots , and the shreiking of women as they were shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meat and robes inside . They had been taken completely by surprise , and those who did manage to escape did so by scurrying into the nearby hills . Being desperate men of courage they afterwards recaptured some of their horses . " Where were your lookouts ? " queried Turtleheart . Two Moons , the heavy set leader of the Cheyenne , spoke up . " We have not had much use for lookouts since the treaty of 1868 For the last seven winters we have lived in peace with the so . : rs . Our only enemies were the Crow . " " I was only a short time ago a handful of troopers came to our camp to move us to the Sioux Agency . When they found we were Cheyenne , they apologized and moved on . " When the Cheyenne leader had finished his report to the council , Crazy Horse rose with a furious anger . " I can not endure any more . Yesterday it was the Cheyenne . Tomorrow , it will be us . Think of our losses since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure the time of avoiding the war cries and paint is long past . "  | Crazy Horse was bristling with anger . " I am war chief in this camp , and I direct Turtleheart to send runners to those bands of Cheyenne and Arapahoe who have cause to unite with us . They must be told that the chieftains of the seven council fires demand their presence on the Greasy Grass for our annual camp . " " Also tell them that it is better to die with honor on the field of battle , than to die of dishonor in old age . "  | The weariness of many sleepless nights weighed upon Turtleheart as he dropped onto a couch of buffalo robes to sip the steaming broth his grandmother had given to him . He had spent many days at a time scouting the far flung areas of the Rosebud and Tongue River valleys . It was only when his supply of pemmican and jerky was exhausted that he returned to camp . " You look so thin and tired , my son . You must stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones . " He did not reply . " You still think of Evensigh . " His grandmother did not wish to mention this subject to her grandson , but she wanted him to know that she shared his thoughts . " Yes grandmother , every day of my life I miss her . " The old woman 's wrinkled face brightened as she asked , " Would you like to know who just came into camp with the Brules and the Santees ? " When Turtleheart showed no sign of interest , she said , " He is a very good friend of yours , my son . " She waved her hand , and a head immediately poked into the entrance of the lodge . " So this is how the brave men loaf : ' On their haunches , warming the earth . Why , I should spit on your couch ... The voice was laughing . Recognition stirred Turtleheart to action , and he jumped to his feet . " Strong Echo ' The two grasped each other and  | indulged in loud shoulder slapping and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Just a little while ago . I was told that the great and fearless warrior , Turtleheart , was somewhere on the purple horizon looking for the enemy . We came in from the south , and did not see anyone , so where were you , oh great and fearless one ? " In spite of the lightness of talk , this was a serious question , and Turtleheart answered it with a sober face . " I was up north toward the Crow territory . We were scouting the area where the Rosebud melts with the Yellowstone . " Strong Echo examined Turtleheart 's tired face and gaunt frame while shaking his head , but said nothing . Turtleheart was aware of his friend 's thoughts , and he , too , said nothing . He asked , instead , about the old people who had been left with Strong Echo when the band left for the hunt . " They are well taken care of . It was Red Cloud himself who took on their responsibility by putting them in his own band . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told his own people that to challenge the word of the white government would bring disaster . There were many , however , who paid no heed to his words and left for Two Kettle 's camp . " " It broke his heart when his own son went with them . I think they will be arriving at the Little Big Horn soon . " " We will be looking for them with joy , Strong Echo . What do you think of the situation ? " " I am not a part of it yet . You and I both know that the long knives have forgotten their promise to provide the people with food . They are starving us . But what you do n't know is that they are breaking the solitude of the Black Hills with their shouts and echoes . They are killing the buffalo within our sacred land . They are laying their curse upon our Black Hills . " Strong Echo scratched his chin . " The more I think about it , the more I realize that we are the declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am glad you have cast your lot with us . " Turtlehearl lost his serious look and grinned . " Strong Echo thanks you , oh worthy scout . " He made a playful pass at Turtleheart , who ducked away . " You always knew I could not go with those whose tongue is forked . " " Strong Echo , you are the best medicine a man like me could have around . You keep me on top of my feelings . " With this feeling of comradeship , the two men forgot the time of day and talked far into the night , long after all of the others had settled into sleep . " The tribe 's greatest hoop is broken . Our respected and beloved leader , the holy Yuwipi man , is dead . Higheagle died during the night . " The sad intoning of the words of the crier as he repeated his message of death , shocked Turtleheart out of his drowsy early morning behavior . Already the grievous wailings of the women were being heard from tipi to tipi . Higheagle 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Turtleheart remarked to Strong Echo as he sipped at his soup . " Some think this is an evil omen , because Higheagle never mentioned the possibility of his going to the land of our ancestors . " " I do not follow your words , Turtleheart . " " Did you notice the haste of the burial ? It was one of the strangest ceremonies I have ever seen . And the mourning was only for one night . The burial procession began so early this morning that the sun was not yet in the sky . And there was no eulogy . Higheagle was buried without the usual formalities . " " You are a leader . Why did n't you say something ? " Turtleheart frowned in puzzlement . " I do not know . It is something hard to explain . When I went into his lodge to pay my last respects , there was an aura of nobility on Higheagle 's face . " Pausing , Turtleheart looked at the sky . " Even in death , his face bore witness to the power he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , I felt incapable of heaping  | worthy commendations on his spirit . All I could do was stand there in silence . " " You did n't take part in the burial rites ? " " No . " " You , for one , should have been there , " his friend admonished Turtleheart . " A strange fear had crept into my thoughts , Strong Echo . You know that his sacred powers went beyond our knowledge , that he had performed phenomenal feats . His physical body did not make me afraid , but I feared the mystery of his spirit . " " Turtleheart , your thoughts are deep indeed . You are not thinking clearly , my friend . You start this conversation with an air of curiosity , then , as you tell me of Higheagle 's hasty burial , you sound so different . " Strong Echo shook Turtleheart 's shoulder . " Do you think that others feel as you do ? " " Yes . Yes , 1 think that is possible . " Turtleheart put his hand on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are good medicine for me . You straighten the crooked thoughts in my mind . " As the two walked toward their horses , Turtleheart said , " This is the day I am to lead our move to camp a little more to the north , up near where the creek widens . Will you be my assistant , Strong Echo ? " " As I once said , I will follow your moccasins . You lead my way The rest of the day was spent in moving the camp . The united bands of Ogalala , Brule , Minneconjou , Hunkpapa , Santee , Yankton and Blackfoot led the way . The Cheyenne , Sans Arc and Two Kettle followed as Turtleheart led them along the Rosebud River until they arrived at the pre-determined council site . The women silently went about the setting up of lodges , gathering firewood , and the hundred other things necessary to settling in a new location . The leaders met in council . Sitting Bull was chosen to serve as spokesman for the consolidated bands and correlator of their movements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the announcement , Turtleheart informed Strong Echo of what had transpired in the council meeting . " I am not happy over the selection of Sitting Bull . I was hoping that Gall would be marked to fill Higheagle 's place , but Sitting Bull was quite effective when he appealed to the minds of the council members . I had heard he was a fiery orator and a man of many moods . " " Yes , and quite surprisingly , " answered Strong Echo . " My grandfather had told me that Sitting Bull 's parents had given him up as a reckless fool when he was but a youth . They were content to put him under the care of Four Horns , his uncle . His companions were few , because he was always getting them into trouble , and he was finally barred from a lot of ceremonies because of his reckless nature . " " How did he take that ? Was he bitter ? " asked Turtleheart . " He must have been hurt deeply . It was then that he began to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Four Horns was a medicine man with the talent for words , he contributed his knowledge to Sitting Bull 's training . Also , because of Sitting Bull 's heritage , it was not too hard for him to gain the power of performance . " Turtleheart was an interested listener , so Strong Echo continued with his story . " His own band considered him to be an agent of the Yuwipi , so he easily gained the status of a medicine man . " " His is an interesting story , but how is he trained in the making of war ? " Turtleheart wanted to know . " The story tellers speak of him as not having the courage to participate in battle , but they do tell of his power ' of vision . He has a remarkable ability to dream , that I do know . He is always the hero , as he has a very high opinion of himself . " " Yes , " nodded Turtleheart . " It can not be denied that he has a way with people . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the laurels that rightly belonged to Gall . Instead of being angry , Gall talks of Sitting Bull as being a great  | person Sitting Bull must have strong medicine to be able to do the things he does . " " I should tell you , Strong Echo , that I sat next to Gall in council . When the results of the voting were made known , Gall conceded the better man had won . " " He said that if war was to come , Sitting Bull was best equipped with the knowledge to deal with the white soldiers . Gall hates them so intensely , he feels his hate will rule over his reason of mind . He said Sitting Bull was also better because he is keen at voicing what is warm to our ears . " " This may be true , Turtleheart , but in the times to come , Sitting Bull will have to rely on such men as Gall . " " Being the showman that he is , he will depend on Gall and other great warriors , then keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving up and down with each word . " Sitting Bull is already following the advice of Gall and Crazy Horse . He has sent out small raiding parties to gather all the guns , ammunition and horses they can find . " The spring day was warm as Turtleheart and Strong Echo reined up their horses on a high rise overlooking the camp . After several days of scouting , the view was welcome . " It always makes my spirit rise and sing to see the magnificent view of the entire camp below . On a clear day you can just make out the path of the Tongue River . When the eye sees this , the mind dwells on my ancestors and the wisdom they had to come to this valley . " Turtleheart took a deep breath and sighed in a moment of happiness . " Look . " Strong Echo pointed a finger a little to the north . " See , all of the people are returning to their lodges from the dance circle . Something must be going on . Let 's hurry down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses ' heels , they rode at a gallop down the hill , in a wide circle . Slowing their horses , they made their way from the outskirts of camp to the center area . Gall was waiting in front of Turtleheart 's lodge . Greeting them with a raised hand and a smile , Gall rose from his sitting position . " You two look happy . " He turned  | to Strong Echo and commented , " You must be good medicine for Turtleheart . His grandmother was just telling me today that until you came along , he was not living in himself . " " Your words are good to hear , " chuckled Strong Echo . " I always knew I had to be good for something other than giving birth to blisters on my hindparts . " He patted himself on the part of the anatomy he spoke of . " I have good news today , " Gall remarked . " My warriors have brought reports that there are now many camps along the Little Big Horn . Already there are four times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Big Horn ? Why are they camped there ? They are not coming here ? " Strong Echo was quizzical . " No , it was a year ago that we all agreed that the Greasy Grass was the best place for this year 's annual council of the Sioux nation , " Gall answered . Gall switched his gaze from one to the other several times before continuing . " Three days ago , Sitting Bull informed us that he would give his body to Wakan Tanka through his performance of the Sun Dance , and would offer the penance of one hundred gashes on his arms . Today , Sitting Bull told us of the message he viewed in the clouds over the ceremonial circle . " " He said the Sioux nation must join forces . He said that the white soldiers ' destiny is death in battle and that we would be the victor . " " You got here right after the council had met . They have decided it is time to move to the Greasy Grass to hold talk of war . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How many warriors will we have in the camp on the Greasy Grass ? " queried Strong Echo . " I would guess about four thousand , " answered Gall . " Four thousand warriors ? Wahhhhah ! "  | It was two days after Sitting Bull 's Sun Dance , and Turtleheart was watching a long train of soldiers and equipment come from the south . They appeared to be going toward Rosebud Creek . After motioning to Strong Echo to join him , they discussed the matter . Going down to the horses , hidden in a clump of bushes , Turtleheart mounted to ride straight toward camp , as Strong Echo remained behind to watch the formation of troops . The camp was aroused with curiosity when Turtleheart rode in at a full gallop . Reaching camp , he started yelling at the top of his voice . " Blue coats ! The soldiers of the enemy are coming this way ! " As his horse came to a sliding stop in front of Sitting Bull 's lodge , Turtleheart was hitting the ground with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Blue Coats ! " " I heard your cries , " said Sitting Bull , as he continued to dab medicine on his scarred arms . As Sitting Bull turned , Turtleheart realized there was another person present . It was Hump , the great warrior chief of the Minneconjou . " Hau , " said Turtleheart , as Hump acknowledged the greeting with a silent hand signal . After advising Hump to see to ' it that someone called all of the chiefs to council , Sitting Bull turned to Turtleheart . " How far away are they ? " " Because they are so many , their pace would enable them to arrive here after a full day of travel , sunup to sundown. "  | " You have seen the enemy , so I think you should stay for the meeting of the chiefs . They will have many things to ask . " Sitting Bull said no more , and resumed the application of the medicine to his wounds . The sounds of people making ready for a hasty move had replaced the original confusion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , and the chiefs lost no time in assembling for a council of war . Almost immediately they were on the way to Sitting Bull 's lodge , which they entered silently , and took their places . When all were assembled , Crazy Horse rose to ask , " How far away are they ? " " Near the upper end of Rosebud Creek . " " How many are mounted and how many on foot ? " " There must be a thousand to fifteen hundred of them , and most are on horses . " " What are your thoughts , Sitting Bull ? " Crazy Horse was now facing the medicine man . " A soldier for a warrior and a warrior for a soldier . We are equal in numbers , but nearly half of our warriors are without the guns they need to fight , " replied Sitting Bull . " May I offer a plan ? " The voice of Gall was unmistakable . All eyes watched him as he continued slowly and with great thought . " Our first concern is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My suggestion is for Sitting Bull , who is still unfit for battle because of his wounds , to lead the old , the women , the children to the big camp on the Little Big Horn . All the warriors will remain here to fight . For us to run now , with night coming , would be disastrous ! " " We all know that our families move much slower than we would , and if the soldiers knew of such a move , they would be sure to attack . Sitting Bull and the camp must move quietly , and we must remain here to protect them . " " The soldiers must know of our camp in this valley , or they would not be moving toward us . They must be planning  | to destroy our camps and supplies , thinking to destroy our will and ability to fight . They know that if they do that , we must bury the tomahawk and remain on the reservation like the dog . " Gall continued talking quietly and quickly . " Our camp is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will then have time to take up our battle plans and could meet the soldiers in battle tomorrow . " " Your thoughts are excellent , Gall , " Crazy Horse commended . " At a given signal we can pull out of the battle and lead them into the hills , then ' make a fast break to join the camp at the Little Big Horn . " " We must be cautious and see what the soldiers do before we attack them . If only a small force of them leaves to investigate our abandoned camp , let them through . They will be scouting and unable to do much , and it will be easier for us if their main force is weaker . " Crazy Horse was a man of battle experience and his words were immediately endorsed . The whole plan was created out of emergency , but the experience of past battles with the soldiers told them this was a good plan . It must be carried out with no loss of time , and the war council was over as abruptly as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as the events of the next day unfolded . Turtleheart and Strong Echo spent the long night taking turns to watch the camp of sleeping soldiers . With the coming of the eastern light , the darkness which enveloped the plains began to crawl away . It was at this time that Strong Echo became aware of the movements of warriors on the west side of the creek . An equal number of warriors were coming up the creek on the opposite side . Turtleheart told Strong Echo the latter group was led by Crazy Horse . The warriors on the far side were led by Gall . Hump would probably be with Gall . Now was the time to be patient . Secrecy was the key to any success they hoped to achieve . Turtleheart prayed that the leaders could hold the young , impatient warriors in check . Any attempt at personal glory would result in disaster for all . Strong Echo 's low words brought Turtleheart 's attention to the soldiers ' camp . They were moving around , and preparing to mount . The absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of impending trouble ? If so , there would be no possible chance of splitting the command , and the odds would be in favor of the enemy . The thoughts in the mind of Strong Echo were imperceptible to Turtleheart , as the older man 's face was impassive . Turtleheart was sure his heart was going to jump out of his chest . Finally the first contingent of soldiers mounted , and with a command , started to move down the valley . The others were still on the ground and it was a little later that they too moved out . As the second contingent of soldiers reached this point however , war whoops echoed across the valley . The Sioux were on the attack . Gall led his warriors. to hit the front of the column on one side and Crazy Horse and his warriors hit the rear of the column on the other side . This maneuver caused the column to turn on its axis , the soldiers completely at a disadvantage . The two scouts welcomed the opportunity to rise from their cramped positions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full view to watch the battle develop . Charging time and again , the Indians kept the soldiers milling around . Only one time did the Sioux let up , and a swift moving formation of soldiers got through . With rifles firing and swords flashing in the sunlight , the soldiers made a run to a small hill . A few warriors pursued the group for a short distance , then returned to the action . The main body of soldiers were able to mass together in a small area , and with their superior fire power , kept the Sioux warriors at a more discreet distance .. Most of the activity now turned into harassment , with the soldiers pinned down . From every direction , the warriors moved in at top speed to shoot the arrows , wheel around and ride back to a'safer distance .  | " Turtleheart , look ! Look down the valley , the first of the soldiers are coming back . They will be caught in a cross fire ! I will warn them ! " Strong Echo 's words were almost lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , riding recklessly straight down the hill . Turtleheart watched until he reached Crazy Horse . The great war chief could be seen gathering his warriors , and leading them in a sweeping curve toward Gall . Gall had his warriors under command and his group fell in behind Crazy Horse and his men . The entire party made one sweeping circle around the soldiers before heading off to the east and disappearing over a hill . The first contingent of soldiers was now on the scene , but they made no effort to follow the Indians . Perhaps they were fearful of an ambush , but it was certain they were glad to have the seige lifted . They had many casualties and were unwilling to make any further hostile moves . Turtleheart smiled in satisfaction as he mounted his pony . The battle plan worked perfectly and there were but few Sioux who could be counted among the casualties . There were a few wounded , but they were all rescued . One of the last men into the big camp on the Greasy Grass was Turtleheart . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sounds of revelry . The hour was late , but many persons were gathered in the center of the camp , and the crier was still extolling the victory . Spurring his horse , Turtleheart rode to camp with the victory song on his lips . Great pride filled his breast as he edged his horse through the people toward the center . There was a tugging at his leg and he looked down to see his grandmother trying to speak with him . He bent low to catch her words . " They are reserving ? a place for you in the council lodge . Gall said to split the time and come . " " We had a safe journey and Sitting Bull has been in a council since we arrived , " she patted him on the leg . A familiar voice broke into their conversation , echoing the grandmother 's words . It was Strong Echo who continued the line of talk . " Sitting Bull has been fanning the flames of  | animosity since his arrival . I have heard that his influence has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his arm . I have also heard you are to attend the council of chiefs . You had better go express your thoughts . Here , I will take your horse . " Approaching the council lodge , Turtleheart could hear the voice of Sitting Bull as he spoke in his most flowery language . Entering , he found that it was filled to capacity with council chiefs , war chiefs and ceremonial chiefs . No one paid any attention to him as they were too engrossed with what Sitting Bull was telling them . " Today we have . tasted victory , but you should not have to strain your memory to know that defeat passes by no age , no race . We must unite to survive , to defeat the white man who is our greatest enemy . " " Because I am a Sioux , one who is proud to be a Sioux , neither time nor the forcing of another way of life onto me will change the enduring emotions I have for our lands , for my people . " " Your wants are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My old body has almost reached the limit of what it can stand , and my mind is getting too tired to know what is best to do , so I am asking you to give my words your great consideration , so you may help make the decisions . " " If you choose to bear the lance with me , we shall taste victory , and we will again dwell as we did in the times that followed Red Cloud 's victory . Today was the battle on the Rosebud , and we won . We must continue to win . " There was a momentary silence before whooping and howling filled the lodge . Turtleheart felt a warm glow over his body ; his spirit was raised by the force of Sitting Bull 's speech . Crazy Horse rose to his feet with a sign for silence . He was of slight , medium build , but his bravery and cunning had made him a giant among a strong people . The red and black of his face paint , as always , concentrated on concealing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words and with little inflection of voice , he cooly related the day 's events . " I measured the actions of our hereditary enemies , the Crow and the Shoshone scouts , and I found them cunning as the coyote . As long as they continue to help the enemy we must remain alert to insure their defeat . " Dramatically , he produced a pipe . Striding forward to the fire , he selected a firebrand and majestically lit the tobacco . He drew long on the pipe and presented it to Wakan Tanka and to Maka Ina . " This is to seal our alliance . " He handed the pipe to Turtleheart who sat on the left of the entrance . A puff of the pipe and he handed it to his left .  | For the next few days , Turtleheart and Strong Echo spent from sunup to sundown checking lookout posts of the scouts . They now stood on a high bluff of the Wolf Mountains , thinking of returning to the camps on the Greasy Grass . Almost simultaneously , both spotted small beads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleeing from the Rosebud Creek a few days before . Horse soldiers ! Their position was north and east across the mountain from the Sioux camp . When dusk fell on this day of June 24 , 1876 , the two men mounted their horses and rode toward the long knives . They moved cautiously , and kept their ears tuned for the slightest sound . They did not want to blunder into the blue coats or their Indian scouts . " Strong Echo , you stay here with the ponies . We must be near where they have stopped to camp and I want to see if I can sneak up on them . " " I can see nothing . It is now too dark to see much . " " They are camped almost directly north of us . " " How can you tell ? Are you sure ? " " Yes . Turn your eyes to the east . Now move them very slowly across the slope below us . You will find the tail of your vision will catch a faint glow of light more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the wind was from the south and he did not want the sound of his voice to be heard by any of the Crow scouts he knew to be around .  | " Ah yes . There is a faint glow of a fire . It is not much . They are keeping the fires small so they will be hard to see . It must be that they are planning something . " " You stay here and I will be back as soon as I can see how many horses they have . When I can study the size of their herd 1 . will know how many of them there are . " With these words , his form disappeared into the gloom of the early night . Turtleheart was thankful for the darkness . It made his task much easier . To be able to thread his way through the night was a skill he had developed over a long period of time . It was but a short time that he could see a couple of small fires . " They are very cautious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Perhaps they had them hid some distance from camp . That did not make sense . He knew the army commanders were too smart to make that foolish a blunder . Dropping onto his stomach , he started to edge closer . There was a definite cause for wonder . Could this be another group from the one they saw from the ridge ? His mind told him there had to be horses around . The army could not travel without horses . Just as he decided to circle the camp , the sound of muffled hoofbeats reached him . A group of Indians and soldiers were bringing the herd up from the other side . Possibly from watering . Under the cover of the noise of the moving horses , he was able to creep closer . With all of his senses straining to their utmost , he was trying to identify the sounds of camp and the sights of the moving figures . He lay unmoving as an Indian came his way . " It was an Arikara ! " he thought . " They are not near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk in another direction , so Turtleheart breathed easier . When his curiosity had been satisfied , he circled slowly away from the enemy to avoid the sentries . He was very careful not to excite the many bushes as he moved . Returning to Strong Echo , he told him of what he had seen . The two warriors led their horses over the divide before  | mounting , Turtleheart to ride to warn the camp and Strong Echo to tell the other scouts . It was after midnight when Turtleheart returned to the sleeping villages of tipis . Going immediately to the large lodge of Sitting Bull , he gave the call of his society to waken the leader . Sitting Bull listened intently to Turtleheart before sending messengers to the chiefs in the different camps . Late as it was , he was calling a council meeting . Dawn was just beginning to melt away the darkness as the council convened to discuss the presence of the soldiers and the obvious nature of their mission . There was a sudden and loud commotion outside . Strong Echo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The troops must be commanded by Yellow Hair . After I left Turtleheart , I went to Loneman and another scout and we returned to watch the enemy . Loneman sneaked up to the horse herd and recognized some gray horses used by some of the men under Yellow Hair . Also , they are on a forced night march ! " " Are you sure ? " questioned Gall . In his face was the reflection of the hate within him for the army leader . " Loneman is outside . He will verify what I have to say . He is one of the most experienced scouts , and he claims to know all of the groups of soldiers in this territory . He is well acquainted with Yellow Hair 's command . " " Sit down , Strong Echo . " " No . Not now . I am stiff from riding , and hungry . If you will excuse me , I will eat something and walk around before I go back up the ridge . " Strong Echo disappeared quietly . " If this leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sure he will not be so merciful toward us as General Crook , the Gray Fox . " Sitting Bull was talking to himself as much as to anyone else . He spoke louder as he continued his thoughts . " He must not come in contact with Crooked Three Stars . Crook was to the south and Custer , if this is the hated Yellow Hair , comes from the north . They must be planning to meet "  | Looking at Turtleheart , he asked , " You guess his force to be half the size of Three Stars ? " " Yes . " " He could decide to attack . He might follow the foolish coaxings of his pride . But he must not know we are here . " The words of Sitting Bull were hesitant , as if he were not sure of his plan of action . " If Yellow Hair is the leader , he has come to do battle . We are well prepared to take him on , if that is what he wishes . Why , just today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw how many warriors we have . " Crazy Horse was up , speaking with the air of a confident war lord . " I saw many groups of warriors making as if in battle . One group , mounted on their best horses , engaged in mock attack . 1 went as far as the Cheyenne camp , the one farthest down the Greasy Grass , and there I heard the beating of the war drum . The sound of the drum made my heart sing . I am happy at the confidence of our combined forces . We have a mighty group of warriors at our command . " Gall asked the courier to go out and tell the many people who were now milling around , to wait for further instructions . All of the camps must know . All drums must remain silent . " Yesterday , I felt tension all clay . 1 could feel that something was about to happen . " Sitting Bull 's face was glowing with the satisfaction of having stirred up the Indians into an emotional state of mind which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue coats attack us , they will be at the mercy of our best warriors and will be defeated . " Sitting Bull was now speaking with his best voice , and his words were noisily accepted by the council members . " How many warriors do we have , Gall ? " " Including the youngest members of the lowest societies , we have more than three thousand . Some will have their first experience in battle . " Sitting Bull rose and commanded , " Strike down half of the tipis . Hide them in the brush alongside the river bluffs. "  | Turtleheart recognized this order as being part of the strategy planned by Sitting Bull to encourage the soldiers to attack . " Hunka , " Gall spoke to Turtleheart . " You are the chief of the scouts . Keep your best eyes watching the blue coats . Bring in the others to help us . Every warrior is needed . " " I will do anything you ask . If you will now excuse me , I will go and see that these things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue coats of Yellow Hair and to keep alert to any sign of Three Stars . " " Good . Our success will depend upon your information . " It was the hour before sunrise , and a lone Sioux scout was hidden in the rocks overlooking where the soldiers had stopped . Even before the gray light smothered the stars faintest glimmer , he was straining his eyes to watch them . From his vantage point he could view all that was happening ; the preparations of the soldiers to move on , and the movements of the Indian scouts . " A south wind is blowing , " he said to himself . " A south wind is a good omen . Ah , now they are beginning to move about more . There are no bugle calls and but small fires . They do know of our camp and they plan to attack . " A horse was moving fast into the camp . He was ridden by an Indian , probably a scout . " It must be important , he is riding so reckless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will wait to see what else they do before I move . Where is the chief of the scouts ? He should be back soon . " The first heat of the sun was warming him , when he felt rather than saw , someone moving up the slope behind him . " Turtleheart must be coming . " It was Turtleheart , who was making his way up a small draw . Arriving at the hiding place of the scout , he asked , " What have you seen ? " " Nothing yet , except for the hurry of one of their scouts who rode into camp . Look , now it seems as they are going to do something . See , they have mounted their horses . Now it looks as if they are going to have an imaginary attack . Ah ,  | now they have their horses at a fast gallop and are charging up the slope . Now they dismount and go through the motions of firing their thunder sticks . " The two scouts watched the troopers make one mock attack before Turtleheart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fool . Yesterday , I was thinking that he was too anxious to do battle . I thought he was willing to gamble away the lives of our relatives and friends to build up his reputation . Now , after viewing the enemy , I have to admit he had sound thoughts behind his oratory . " " Yes , " agreed the scout . " If Sitting Bull had not talked as he did , we would be unprepared for the attack . " " They must know where our encampment is . They must be planning an attack today , or else , why would they march all night ? See how those murderous Crows are returning from their scouting missions ? " Turtleheart spat upon the ground . " They are very skilled at spying . You can not ever trust them . " Another hour had passed , during which time the soldiers had mounted and started to ride across the slope and up the divide . " You watch them , and when you see them going down the west slope of the mountain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council . " " I will go to Strong Echo and tell him 1 must see Sitting Bull . He is waiting for me down below . " Turtleheart was gone with the silence of a shadow . " What do you make of the enemies ' actions , Turtleheart ? " Strong Echo greeted him . " They must plan to attack our villages today . The sun will be in the afternoon sky before they can do that . We do not have much time . I will tell Sitting Bull that they are on their way and will attack from up the valley . " As Turtleheart approached the large encampment from the north , he realized it was mid-day . Time was of vital importance now . He welcomed , yet half dreaded , the knowledge that the time for battle was fast approaching . He beat his lathering pony to a faster run . Would he ever reach the first group of lodges ? After what seemed a lifetime  | they were painting their faces with the designs of war . As though by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Some of the warriors leaped to the backs of their painted horses and followed Turtleheart to the camp of the Hunkpapa . Reaching the council lodge , he flung himself to the ground in front of the large lodge . It had its sides rolled up enough to see inside . " The south wind is good to us today . I found you all in one place . " Turtleheart spoke excitedly and dropped to the ground on both knees . Pushing the floor of hides aside , he drew a map of the enemy movements in the dust of the earth . " Now that we know the soldiers are getting into position to strike , we know what we must do . We should send all of the women and children and the infirm to the flats at the lower end of camp , even beyond the Cheyenne lodges . Gather them quickly , this is an emergency and we do not have much time . " Sitting Bull spoke rather slowly , but the orders were put together in few words . Messengers were dispatched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broken Bow , " called Gall , " Come in here . " When a huge , elderly man came to the entrance and blocked it with his massive frame , the Hunkpapa war chief declared , " I want you to ride to the Sans Arc and the Cheyenne villages , and do this quickly . " " Have them ready to move their warriors along the creek until they reach the fork of the little river . They are to follow this until they are opposite the Minneconjou lodges . Tell the Minneconjou , they are to prepare to join with the Sans Arc and meet the Cheyenne on the creek . Tell each leader he is to appear here at this lodge as soon as he can . It is time to make the final decisions . " " Gall , " said Crazy Horse , " I will take my Ogalala and move them up the creek and below the bluffs . We will be conof riding , he galloped his horse through the tipis at breakneck speed , scattering the dogs as he went . Slowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breechclout , and  | cealed in the ravines and brush , and will be able to strike the ones who will come in from that side . " " Good words , " commented Gall . " Our medicine is strong today . Victory is in our reach . " " That leaves the Brule to reinforce the Cheyenne . " It was Crooked Nose who was speaking . " And that leaves Sitting Bull and the Hunkpapas and my village , the Blackfoot to lay in wait for the enemy coming in on this side of the Greasy Grass . " " Good . " emphasized Gall . " You are right , Crooked Nose , " said Sitting Bull . " But I will not be with you . " " Look , " spoke Crooked Nose in a heated tone , " I do not intend to be put in charge of the women and children again . I am one of the most experienced warriors and will lead my own braves . " " No , no , Crooked Nose . You will not be in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and warrior for the battle . " Gall soothed the irate chief . " You will be in cornmand of your warriors , but Sitting Bull will be in charge of the whole battle . From this point here . " Gall quickly drew a map in the dust to indicate the positions of the Indian placements . " Not under any circumstances must any of you go to the aid of another unit . Not until your own opposing force is defeated . " The assembled leaders nodded in understanding . " Again I warn you as I repeat my words . Do not go to assist any other group until you have claimed victory in your own battle , " Gall concluded with great emphasis . " May I remind you , " spoke Crazy Horse , " that each of you use our age-old plan of sending warriors out as decoys to draw the enemy into a trap . " " Yes , we will do that . It always works against the white men . They are too stupid to learn . " " Turtleheart , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gall . " He will be leading some Minneconjous , Sans Arcs and Cheyennes . You will lead your own warriors in support . Just  | see that they are well hidden . When the soldiers come down from the east to meet Hump and his warriors , you attack from the side in a surprise movement . " " Some of your warriors are inexperienced , so keep them under control . A foolish movement by any of your men could be a disaster . " " My thanks to you , Gall . For a time it seemed as though I would have to join the women . " " It was a thought , my boy . It was a thought . " The eyes of Gall sparkled at his words . " Send your scouts to the four winds to spot any soldier movement . The Gray Fox may be close . " " The leaders from the other villages are beginning to arrive . We must now make our final plans , " exclaimed Sitting Bull .  | When the sound of gun firing flailed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were getting their horses ready to mount ; desperation in their minds . They could not see the fighting as the first attack was from up the Greasy Grass , near the Hunkpapa village . The low hills obscured their vision . Turtleheart sent three Cheyenne scouts toward the engagement to find out what was happening , but when they could catch no sight of the battle , they returned to crouch down behind a small bank within sight of Turtleheart . Wild yells piercing the air announced the discovery of a second prong of the attack approaching the village of the Minneconjou . The waiting warriors could see their comrades ride to the battle with swinging tomahawks , clubs and lances . While they watched the Cheyenne braves cross the river to meet the soldiers , Turtleheart was watching Sitting Bull moving about in all directions on top of a small hill . Astride a gray horse , he carried a crooked lance decorated with long banners , which he used for his silent commands . Sitting Bull made an imposing sight on top of the hill , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene . Interpreting his signals , they then relayed the desired information to the men in the battles . Turning his attention to the battle , Turtleheart compared the Indians ' attack to the actions of a school of fish . They rode to the attack in a broad sweeping curve to meet the blue coats who were approaching at a fast gallop . Two riders were streaking toward Turtleheart 's position , the froth flying from their horses ' mouths . He recognized  | the warriors as Gall and Strong Echo . As they came to a sliding halt , Gall shouted angrily , " I have made a fateful blunder . There are soldiers riding down the other side of the river toward the Cheyenne village and that is where all of the women and children are . And the Cheyenne are going across the river . " A Cheyenne youth volunteered to go to the Ogalala village where the warriors were getting ready . " I will tell them we must brave a move to intercept the enemy before they reach my village . " " Move fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much time . " " He has a long way to go . I hope he can make it , " Strong Echo put in . Turtleheart echoed his thoughts . Gall 's voice was flat as he said , " When Strong Echo brought word that the soldiers to the east were going down to the area where our families are hidden , we wasted no time getting here . I could see them riding in columns of two across the open on the other side of the river and I knew we must change our plans . " He was visibly upset at this development . " Look , across the river ! " Turtleheart pointed toward Crazy Horse and his warriors riding fast across the slope . " Hah , it is a move to cut off the enemy , " Gall spoke in a tense manner as he slapped his horse into a full run . Turtleheart motioned to four Minneconjous to follow him , and instructed them with a terse statement . " We are going to help our Cheyenne brothers draw the enemy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As they mounted the first hillock of ground , he and the four warriors gave loud war whoops and joined forces with four Cheyennes . There were now nine warriors on the way to attempt to decoy the soldiers from the lower end of the encampment . This was a very dangerous and desperate maneuver , one that could be fatal . They were less than one hundred yards away when the soldiers caught sight of them . There was a noticeable slackening of pace as the troopers were undecided as to which group  | to follow . One of the Cheyenne warriors carefully aimed his gun and fired . The leader of the soldiers grabbed his shoulder and the soldiers were no longer undecided . The Indians turned and fled as the troops wheeled about and started after them . This was a gallant effort to draw the enemy , but it would be foolish and ineffectual to tarry longer . They raced for their very lives . Two of the Cheyenne were shot from their mounts . From the corner of his eye , Turtleheart saw two Minneconjous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These were no ordinary Blue Coats ; they had an extraordinary skill with the rifle . The Indians were now pushing their horses to the limit while riding low alongside the horses ' backs . All thoughts of heroics were gone . They had to reach the rest of the Indian forces or die . There was sudden pandemonium as the concealed warriors left their place of hiding and charged the troopers . The air was filled with blood curdling screams intended to terrify the horses of the enemy and make them unmanageable . Turtleheart and his remaining companions turned their ponies and joined the flooding , screaming mass of painted Indian warriors . Quickly scanning the area , Turtleheart could see the elite warriors under Crazy Horse 's command sweeping in from the other side . The waters of the Little Big Horn turned red with blood in just minutes as wounded and dead men and horses plunged into the river . The Blue Coats were utterly confused at the sudden turn of events and were looking for an avenue of escape . At close quarters the long rifles were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bows and arrows and lances . The horses reared frantically and threw many of the troopers . Horses which had been shot , bucked and screamed , and some dropped dead with riders still on their backs . The battlefield was filled with dust and black smoke powder as the troops frantically made their way up the slope of a small hill . Soldiers and Indians were engaged in hand to hand combat . Horses were running back and forth in terror ,  | adding to the confusion . Warriors in groups of two and three were rushing at the enemy to express their deeds of bravery by counting coup , only to be killed by the soldiers for their reckless behavior . Many of the young and reckless braves crossed the death flights of their own comrades ' arrows . As the troopers began to dismount , Turtleheart could hear someone repeatedly ordering the Indian warriors to concentrate their fire on the still mounted soldiers . Turtleheart and his men swept close to the hill where the soldiers were now concentrating , and he searched for the leading officer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fallen horse as a breastwork . Circling to a stop , Turtleheart started to reload his gun . Looking around he was surprised to see that no man of the enemy was moving . The battlefield was quiet , except for the loud yells of the Sioux and Cheyenne , and these sounds echoed in a strange way . The full comprehension of what had happened turned the terrible war cries into resounding tones of victory and joy . Accompanying these sounds were those of sadness and despair as men and women searched and found fallen friends and relatives . The death wails of the women caused Turtleheart 's flesh to crawl . Rubbing his hand over his forehead , he jumped from his horse and stepped over the sprawling bodies of the soldiers as he ascended the hill . His body crouched over , he carefully and swiftly scrutinized the individual forms . Around him , the many saddles , blankets , white gloves , rifles , boots and other items of clothing were being plundered by the victorious Indians . All of them were methodically scalping the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their war shirts . " Has anyone found the leader of the Blue Coats ? " Gall 's loud voice was unmistakable . " Here . Over here ! " someone answered . " He has yellow hair , and it is cut short . " " Yellow Hair , " Turtleheart 's body stiffened at the news . " Loneman was right when he said our enemy was commanded by the hated one ! " Gall 's voice commanded the atten- tion of many of the nearby Indians and they all rushed over to see for themselves if this was indeed the hated Custer . Turtleheart and Gall were both running now , and reached the spot where Broken Bow was excitedly gesturing . At his feet was the lifeless form of an officer with short yellow hair . " Gall , " said Turtleheart , " you are the rightful one to lay claim to this leader 's weapons . " " No ! No ! " Broken Bow was emphatic in what he said . " I say this man shot himself . He destroyed his own life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will bring bad things to you , your relatives ; all of us . No , you can not take anything . " " You saw him do this thing ? " There was a puzzled expression on Gall 's face as he questioned Broken Bow 's statement . Broken Bow let his eyes rest longingly on the pistols belonging to Yellow Hair before answering . " In the last of the battle , the white handles on his short guns drew my eyes . He was crouched behind his dead horse and I was over there . " He pointed to a few yards behind the slope . " I was about out of ammunition , so I lay there waiting for a soldier to die . When Yellow Hair stopped to reload his guns , I took advantage of his distracted attention and crawled closer . When he looked up and saw his forces crumbling all around him , there was terror on his face . He put a gun to his head with both hands and fired . When he did this thing , I knew I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Turtleheart looked at Yellow Hair , and noticed that blood had run over his chin and mustache . He was lying on his back , eyes closed . His right hand , covered with blood , still clasped the left hand fingers which still held the gun . Gall drove a war lance into the ground next to the body , then bent to strip the bloody coat from the leader . He hung the coat on the lance , saying , " It is evil medicine and a bad omen to take what belonged to one who takes his own life . " " As you say , Broken Bow , " continued Gall , " this man has had his hair cut short . That is why we could not spot him in battle . We always knew him with long hair , like an Indian .  | That is all he ever did in common with us . " Gall spat on the ground . A lone horseman loped up to the group , and as he stopped he said , " My relations , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure that none are among those who live . " It was Sitting Bull who was issuing the orders . " There is one over there who lives . If he is not seriously wounded , bring him here and tie him . " Gall gave the commands . The young soldier was dragged over and tied in spreadeagle fashion to await Sitting Bull 's disposition . Although bleeding and in a somewhat dazed condition , the youth did not appear to be seriously wounded . An elderly woman pushed her way through the gathering and before anyone could stop her she had mercilessly struck the soldier in the head with a tomahawk . He had been hit twice before she could be pulled away , but it was already too late , as the prisoner was dead . " I had to avenge , " she screamed . " I killed him to avenge my son who was just found dead . " The words were hysterical , and as she was carried away by her relatives she started a loud wail . Sitting Bull strode over to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question . " I need a live soldier to carry a message to Three Stars , and now this one is no longer able to do this . " Near the body of Yellow Hair , Turtleheart saw a soldier move his head . Bending over the form , he turned the blue coat over and pressed his thumbs on the closed eyes . A strong moan escaped the lips . " Come here , this one lives ! " he shouted . " His head has been creased . Come help me get him to his feet . " " Make sure that nothing happens to this man , " Sitting Bull roared . " I want him to carry a message . Protect him from the old women if you can . " There was a note of derision in his voice .  | Looking around , Sitting Bull seemed to be impatient . " I want Strong Echo . Find him . He can speak the enemy tongue . " Turtleheart was reviving the wounded soldier when Strong Echo came riding up on a cavalry horse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Sitting Bull . " You speak the tongue of the long knives , so tell this white warrior to ride to Three Stars with a message . He is to warn them that they are not to come into this area . If they do , they will meet the same fate as Yellow Hair and his men . Let him tell them that we will not meet with them until they have removed all of the white invaders from our hunting ground . " These words were greeted by loud cheers . Still shaky from his wound and surrounded by unfriendly painted faces , the young soldier was badly frightened . Deep down , Strong Echo felt sympathy for the man as he helped him mount a horse . Struck on the rump by Strong Echo , the horse jumped and started running down the slope . The wild and loud jeers of the Indians echoed in the ears of both horse and rider and frightened them even more . Strong Echo grunted and laughed , " The way he rides , I do not think I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look , the horse has stumbled ! " A cloud of dust marked the spot where the horse fell . The horse rose to his feet and galloped away , but the human form lay still . Turtleheart raced his horse down the same path the soldier had taken , but warriors from the banks of the river were there first . " He is dead , " they observed without emotion . " The fall broke his neck . " They shrugged their shoulders and rode off . Without dismounting , Turtleheart knew they were right , so he wheeled his pony around and rode back toward Sitting Bull . On his way , he saw his grandmother standing by an arroyo , so he detoured in her direction . She was watching other women loot the bodies and mutilate the naked forms . Her face brightened at the sight of him and she came up to his horse . " I am so glad you are all right my son . I prayed with my whole self for your safety . " Turtleheart jumped from his horse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry your tears , " he said . " I am safe , and will be here to take care of you . " " I was standing here , afraid to go look for you . I feared I would find you among the dead . I am crying because I felt the joys of ancient times when I saw you . " " Come , grandmother , I will take you to the lodge and you can rest . You should not be here watching this ... " " That does not disturb me so much , Turtleheart , I know that many mothers and wives have lost their loved ones to the  | guns of the invaders , so they must be allowed to destroy the ghost-spirits of the enemy . " " Just the same , grandmother , I am glad you are not out there doing as they are doing . And you must not watch . " Turtleheart looked out over the trampled hills and slopes . His heart was sick as he saw the desecration which was everywhere . " Grandmother , this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind , as the Holy Mystery intended . Look at it now ; trampled and with the dead Iying upon it . Man has defiled the goodness of Maka Ina . Some of those dead out there were nothing but mere boys , and it is wrong for them to die . It does not matter whether they are friends and relatives or white , this is wrong , all wrong . They should not have to die because of someone else . Come , grandmother , I do not want you here . " A truant curiosity lingered within his mind . Do the white women cry for their men who will never , ever return to their arms ? In his heart he knew the answer , and the answer made him very sad .  | With the intense excitement of the battle now gone , the following day was a tiring one . With the news of more of the blue coats coming , tempers were short . The relatives and friends gathered their dead , and the wailing of the women could be heard the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its share of victims . Turtleheart stayed near the lodge of Sitting Bull and waited for messages from his scouts . He knew this was a very crucial time , and felt it wise to stay in camp . In the early afternoon he watched many young warriors go into the lodge of Sitting Bull . They were trying to get the medicine man to lend his weight to the demands of some to attack the other soldiers . However , he knew they should thank the Holy Mystery for being alive and that they should let wiser heads rule . There were many of these hot-blooded warriors who , having tasted victory , asserted that the battle had just begun at the Little Big Horn . Flushed with the charm of victory , they all said this was the summer of good omen ; now was the time to drive the palefaces back to the dawnlight . By subtle means and promises , the medicine man persuaded the belligerent young men to hobble their emotions and wait . Many times that afternoon Turtleheart heard Sitting Bull say , " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fruits of victory ? The white soldiers know that we have taken many scalps , and soon they will call me to council for the terms of peace which we will dictate . " Late that afternoon , Gall and Crazy Horse entered the lodge with unsmiling faces . They sat in front of Sitting Bull , who waited for them to speak .  | " I hope that I am not the only one that these hot-blooded young braves have been pestering for permission to rub out the invaders , " Crazy Horse spoke slowly . Sitting Bull 's voice was stern , " I watched you pull out for the flats , but I could not stop you . What , may I ask , was your reason for not obeying our agreed plan of warfare ? " Crazy Horse gave his story with unbiased detail . " Everything was going to plan , and we had the soldiers pinned down . Just as we were going to circle them , word reached us that our families were being attacked . This word spread like fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save our families . I thought that was where the biggest battle was being fought , and if the women and children were being attacked , we were needed there . " " As we crossed the branch of the creek forking toward the flats we saw the soldiers were already on the hill . We were all of one mind , and wasted no time in racing to cut off the long knives . The rest you know , so I have no further words . " Crazy Horse waited for a moment expectantly , but when Sitting Bull said nothing , he quietly made his exit . The silence was finally broken by Gall who said , " We can not stay here much longer . The odor of death is already in the air and will be unbearable soon . I vote that we strike camp and move to the Twin Buttes on the Grand River . " " Yes , this is a bad place to stay . There are going to be more white soldiers here to see what happened , and we should be gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell where we have gone , as the Crow and Shoshone scouts will be able to read them . " " Call Turtleheart in , " said Gall . " We can have a few of our scouts stay here under Loneman after we leave . " " Your words are wise , Gall . We will move to the Grand River and camp below the twin buttes . " When informed of the decision to move , Turtleheart answered , " 1 will select the scouts immediately . They have rested and will be anxious to get away to higher ground . "  | Stepping out of the lodge , Turtleheart saw a group approaching . His grandmother was among them , and he stepped up to put his arm around her shoulders . The leader of the group spoke with a smile . " I have heard nothing but praise for you . You are an expert scout leader , Turtleheart . " " Iron Shield , you make my spirits rise . Praise coming from you makes my heart feel good . Did you lose any warriors ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a few wounded , but none were serious . The camp crier said this morning we lost sixty-three warriors . " " We did lose sixty-three . I am sorry so many fell , but if we had been on the other side , we would be more sorrowful . " Turning to his grandmother , Turtleheart changed the subject . " I hope you are well rested , because we are moving to the Grand River , near the twin buttes . Everybody must be ready to leave this afternoon . " " My son , some of us are going to go with Iron Shield and his band . They are going back to the reservation . " She spoke slowly , her eyes looking at the ground . " Back to the reservation ? " Turtleheart 's voice showed his disapproval . " Why ? " " Control yourself , " Iron Shield stated defensively . " If you will hear us out , you will then understand why we have made this decision . " " Understand ? Your tongue speaks words that I find hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the reservation , and now you want to go back to starve again ? " " Most of my warriors are staying with you . They will do as you command , but some of us are fearful . The elderly and the women with small children feel they would be more secure on the reservation . The battle was not good for the young , and we feel there is more to come . We feel that no matter what happens , we would rather die among our loved ones who are still around us . " " We are tired , Turtleheart , " his grandmother said sadly . " After what happened yesterday , we feel we are doing what  | is best for all of us . We do not wish to be a broken travois hindering your movements . " She sighed wearily . " Iron Shield has spoken our thoughts of death , and we must face this . I know I am going to die soon and I want to pass into the great beyond near my brother 's resting place . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old woman turned away , tears in her eyes . " Always keep the winter count with you . Remember , " she added fondly , " as long as I live I shall have hot broth ready for your return . " " Grandmother . " Turtleheart paused , unable to think of what to say , as he was stunned by the sudden turn of events . Finally , in a voice choking with many unspoken words of affection , he said very quietly , " Goodbye , my dear grandmother . " Not daring to say any more , he embraced her for a moment before turning away . Without looking back , he disappeared among the lodges . Two days later Turtleheart felt a terrible loneliness as he sat thinking of how he had watched his grandmother leave with Iron Shield 's small band . His stomach felt weak as he remembered her saying one time that no man will ever be able to control his destiny . Even the twin buttes seemed lonely . As he sat there lost in his thoughts , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was only when he noticed the stoic faces cast a spell of foreboding , that he came back to the realization of the moment . Only Loneman entered the open flap of the lodge . His silence gave evidence of bad news to those present . " I carry bad words , my friends . With troubled heart I must tell you what we have seen . " He sat , Indian fashion , with crossed legs , to continue his story . " We have scouted many blue coats on the move . There are more soldiers than I have seen in all of my life . They count many times greater than the enemy forces we have battled in the past . There are more groups than I have fingers . " " How many have you seen ? " queried Turtleheart.  | " Two large groups and many small ones . Strong Echo says they are well armed and have what he calls the deadly Gatling guns that shoot without stopping . " " What is this gun you speak of ? " Gall 's voice quivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , my friend . " Strong Echo came in and stood expectantly with his arms folded across his chest . " Tell about the Gatling gun the blue coats have . " " Yes . " He stepped across the lodge and sat next to Turtleheart . " It is a giant gun . It shoots shells that explode , and they weigh two pounds , like a rock this big . " He formed his hands to show the size . " I have never seen this gun used , but I am told it shoots fast , as fast as you can count . It leaves nothing standing , " he concluded . The silence was oppressive , and Gall finally asked , " How far away are these blue coats ? In what direction ? " " At the rate they travel , I should guess not more than two days time from here , and mostly to the east , " Loneman answered , while pointing with his hand . The message was directed to Sitting Bull as their acknowledged leader , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he sensed all attention was on him , he shook his head and uncrossing his legs , slowly arose . He started to speak , but the nervous twitching of the corners of his mouth spoke more than words . The hard glint in his eyes gave way to fear . " I do not see how this thing could happen , " he said finally . " The enemy should be asking for peace , not searching for war . " His words were emphatic . Now his forehead was wrinkled with thought as he admitted , " Thinking about these things makes my head whirl . " He bowed his head and looked at the tipi floor as if the proper words could be found there . " No , I just do not understand . Even Red Cloud did not kill as many long knives as we did , and he was given peace . " Looking up , Sitting Bull directed his words at Gall . " I do not  | intend to be pushed into the narrow boundaries of a reservation . I will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's burden . " " Sitting Bull , " Gall said flatly , " we have a choice of two plans . We can go south to the land of the " Spiolas " , or we can go north , into the land of the Redcoats . Which shall it be ? " Hump jumped to his feet and shouted , " North , I say north . " Hump was surprised at his own actions and now moderated his tone . " We have friends in the north , and they are treated with respect by the Redcoats . The Redcoats speak with a straight tongue . They will treat us right , not like dogs . " " Your words are true , Hump , " Crow Dog interjected . " The north is a friendly country , our type of country . I do not think we can live very long in the heat of the south . And our enemies , the bluo coats , would always be there to harass us . Sitting Bull very slowly moved his eyes to look at each individual to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by a simple nod of the head , with one exception . Crazy Horse shook his head . " Moving to the land of the Redcoats is only a temporary solution . The white man is taking over that country too . What is happening to us here will also happen up there . " His finger was shaking in the direction of the north , and he now brought it down to point at the others . " Iron Shield has already decided and left . More are now thinking of running away . We must remember that the things we fear will always be creeping up on us until there is nowhere to turn . " Crazy Horse was pleading . " Knowing my own thoughts , I am afraid that my hopes will never be realized if that kind of frightened Indian is at my side . This is not the time to act like a weeping woman . Wipe the clouds of self pity from your minds and face reality . Think , and you will know that we can regain our land only by violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours , then we must die . "  | Crazy Horse paused to let the full impact of his impassioned words be assimilated by the others . Clearing his throat , he raised his eyes above his audience and continued , " I have pondered this truth too long . We must never forget that this is our land . We are not guilty of making these times dangerous . We are not responsible for the fears and frustrations which tear at our people . It is the white man who is tearing our hearts out . It is he who steals and lies and kills the innocents . " Crazy Horse was now on his feet , his eyes ablaze with scorn . " When you are pitifully driven back from the land of the Redcoats , you will then help me carry the lance . " He looked at his hand which he was unconsciously flipping over . Defiance was in his words . " If my people and I must die , then we will die like brave Sioux . I go now to get my people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right or left , Crazy Horse scooped up his rifle and brandishing it , stalked from the lodge . " Crazy Horse speaks with a straight tongue , " sadly admitted Sitting Bull . " If only the bigger part of the Sioux nation , who are under Red Cloud and Spotted Tail , had remained with us instead of going on the reservation , it would be the white invaders who would be meeting difficulties now . In spite of all my attempts , I can not keep our people united , and divided we are weak . " " I do not know what your plans are Strong Echo , " whispered Turtleheart , " but I can not go north . " Before his friend could reply , Turtleheart rose to address Sitting Bull . " Because of reasons , it is necessary for me to remain in this land . " He put earnestness in his words , in the hope that the others would not think he was being a traitor and turning into a white man 's Indian , a reservation loafer . Sitting Bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts . " A strong man like you means safety for us . I am sorry to lose you , but I can understand why you must stay . I wish to commend you and your untiring scouts for keeping such a keen vigil on the enemy . It was the  | efforts of you and your warriors that saved our people from being annihilated . You spoiled the surprise attacks . It is with a good heart that I thank you . " The great emotion in Sitting Bull prevented him from speaking in his normal manner . " Sitting Bull , I also choose to remain . " It was Strong Echo who spoke . " I will follow the moccasins of Turtleheart . " " If that is your wish . You will be good medicine for your friend . Before you leave , " the medicine man was appealing to them , " I would like to ask you to do us a favor . Will you see our old friend Hidetrader ? See what you can find out about the white man 's plans . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send us a message . Hidetrader is full of information . He will tell you what the white man plans to do next . " " We shall do as you wish , " Strong Echo promised . " We shall make plans to go there from here . " " We can leave for Rapid Creek today , " added Turtleheart . Evening was approaching as Turtleheart and Strong Echo led their horses out of camp . The wind muffled the small noises they made , and when a few hundred yards from the camp they mounted and rode eastward , zigzagging through the pines . No word had passed between them since they started , the silence a true indication that two friends do not have to speak to know what is in each other 's minds . Dusk had darkened the stirring grass at their horses ' feet as they reached the summit of a high plateau . They were taking great care to stay to the high ridges to avoid the many scattered mining camps in the area . Turtleheart was in the lead , since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would occasionally come upon an obstruction and have to seek another way . Turtleheart enjoyed the thrill of this fast travel , but was perturbed that the darkness hid the familiar signs . When dawn sent arrows of light into the sky , the two men hid in a ravine close to a stream . Strong Echo slept while Turtleheart kept the first watch . This was in enemy territory so neither spoke as they exchanged places . The language of the signs was their communication .  | After Turtleheart had rested , the two mounted their horses and again turned toward the east . The area was teeming with white people , and daylight travel was hazardous . There was something revitalizing in the presence of danger however , so both enjoyed the challenge . As Turtleheart 's spirits picked up , he seemed to be more like his old self . Once more he acted with the speed of his thoughts and the boldness of his action set a fast pace . They always kept to the high plateaus , their ponies moving fast across the open areas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canyon . It was late in the afternoon of the second day when they stood still in the bottom of a draw , covering their horses muzzles with their hands . A small group of white men passed them so closely , the Indians could hear snatches of conversation in their strange language . The danger of discovery over , Turtleheart and Strong Echo led the horses through the thick brush , coaxing their nervous animals to ignore the scratching branches . Finding water , they stopped to let the ponies drink and to rub the legs of the animals to ease the tired tendons . When the horses were taken care of , the two men ate of the jerky in the saddle bags . It was Strong Echo 's turn for a rest when Turtleheart went to check the ponies again . He suddenly decided it might be wise to set his lookout post a little ways down , where they had heard the passing white men . The chattering of the white men was apparent before he reached the post at the mouth of the ravine . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , but one of the voices nudged his memory . His body stiffened with recognition . It had been almost two years since he heard those voices . Hot memories crowded into his mind as he crawled forward until he was only a few feet away from their fire . Through an opening in the brush , he peered at the men . There was no doubt .  | His spine crawled with the thought of delicious revenge for the abduction of Evensigh . This emotion was soon replaced by a shrewd , detached calm . If he had followed his first impulse to kill , who could tell him where Evensigh was ? A plan formed as he watched the two brew their evening coffee . Coldly and calculatingly , he lay down his rifle and drew the knife . In the dark he felt for a rock just the right size , large enough to create a noise and small enough to throw accurately . His hand closed over one , and he carefully threw it over their heads . As it thumped to the ground on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was upon the nearest man before the white men knew what had happened . The knife went into his back to the hilt . With equal swiftness , he pounced on the other man , who was stunned with surprise . Fast as a thrust of fear , Turtleheart had wrenched the beardless one 's arm behind his back until he heard the bones crack . A cry of agony escaped the man 's lips and he sagged , moaning , to the ground . A sharp crack of a breaking stick and Turtleheart turned , with the knife poised for use . Strong Echo suddenly emerged and stopped at the sight of the knife . " What are you doing ? " Strong Echo looked at the two white men . " You nearly scared the leggins from me with all of this commotion . " Strong Echo wiped his brow and exclaimed , " Say , do n't you know you have friends when there is chance for combat ? You do not have to be selfish and kill them both ? Save one for me . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , there was little time to search for one who sleeps . These are the ones who stole Evensigh and left me to die . " Strong Echo turned the body of the dead man over . " Look ! " he exclaimed . " This one has two scalps . Two fresh Indian scalps . " His voice mirrored dismay when he realized they were from a woman and child . Turtleheart poked at the other form with his toe . " This one is not dead . When he revives , ask him what they did with Evensigh . See , he is coming back to reality now . "  | Strong Echo asked many questions , and the frightened man told him all he knew . As he watched Turtleheart with the knife , he pleaded for mercy . " Mercy he wants ? " asked Turtleheart . " I will give him mercy . " With a swift motion , he plunged the knife into the man 's chest . With a cold stare of contempt , Turtleheart watched the man sink to the ground and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside Rapid Creek . He watched the approach of the two riders with eyes narrowed to mere slits . When he recognized them as Sioux , he straightened from his casual slouch and waved a greeting . His face was wreathed in smiles as he cried out his surprise . Hidetrader was an elderly white man of medium height and frame . His beaver cap and beard made his face appear round as the full moon . The face above the beard glistened with shiny sweat and he laughed heartily as he pulled off the cap . Turtleheart slid off his mount and grabbed the trader 's outstretched hand with his own . " How good it is to see you again , my friend . How are your wife and boy ? " The trader 's smile vanished . Choosing to ignore the question , he motioned for them to go inside the log cabin . Inside , they reclined on couches of buffalo hides while their host prepared food for his guests . Turtleheart and Strong Echo had not eaten all day , and they devoured the broth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but watched them in silence . When they had finished , Hidetrader tossed them a wet cloth for the wiping of faces and hands , before asking , " Which direction did you come from ? " " From the southwest and acrossthe Paha Sapa . We went on around the miners by staying in the high places . "  | " You are either as wary as the puma , or just plain darn lucky . Those men are all over this country . Just a few miles from here is a large camp , and it is bigger every time I go there . Gold seekers come in every day . " Hidetrader quizzically turned to Strong Echo . " What is your name ? I have never seen you before , have I ? If you are traveling with Turtleheart , you are a friend of mine . Shake ? " " Strong Echo , " was the reply . " When I was a youth , I was taken to the east , and I returned only a year or so ago . So you can call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family ? You did not answer my question before , so I ask again . " The white man was silent for a long time , and did not look at either of his companions . Finally he spoke . " All of my life I have made it a point to ignore the differences of our skins . You Indians are happy with your skins and I was contented with mine . We accepted each other with mind and heart , and I soon learned to respect my red brothers . I even fell in love with an Indian maid and married her . She bore me a son who was the spittin ' image of you Sioux . A good lookin ' lad , he is . The very thought of them warmed my heart . " " After Custer had met his reward , they put up a lot of posters in the settlement . What with knowing what you did to General Crook , those posters offered a fifty dollar reward for every Indian scalp brought in . " " Now , that sure put me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late . My family was gone . All I saw was the sign of some scuffling in here and outside . It was dark by the time I got home , and too dark to track . I spent the rest of the night searching the hills anyway , but I found nothing . No sign of my wife or my son . I did some crying too . " Tears welled in Hidetrader 's eyes as his words trailed off . " When it was daylight , I came back here and picked up the trail . It led along the creek for about eighty paces , then it went off southwest . By the time the sun was up halfway , I saw them . It was the torture of a lifetime , seeing them dead .. . both dead ... scalped . " His voice was sobbing now .  | Turtleheart and Strong Echo exchanged glances that warned each other this was not the time to mention the white men they had encountered , nor of the scalps they carried . Regaining his composure , Hidetrader studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . I have learned what you Indians always considered evil . From now on I will never live among the whites . I am no longer one of them . I belong to no one . " " You are wrong , Hidetrader , " Turtleheart interrupted . " You are welcome among the Sioux . They respect you . When they learn of your sorrow , they will want you to become one of them . " " Thank you , Turtleheart . I owe your people more than I can ever repay . Until I came here and lived among you , life was no account . It was she , she and her people , who rescued me from a life of loneliness and taught me how to live . " Now , Turtleheart spoke with deliberate care . " My heart lies on the ground for you , but this is of little comfort , I know . Your loss is more than a man should have to bear . " " Now do n't you go a feeling sorry for me , Turtleheart . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in danger . As for me , I do not want anyone to share my trail of sorrow . You have had more than your share of sorrow too . " Hidetrader wiped the back of his hand across his mouth . " Turtleheart , the death of your grandfather has been avenged . Fate dealt with Two Lance and Iron Feet for their foul deed . The two of them were shot from their horses the day after the posters were put up . They were trying to sneak out of the settlement real quiet , when a scalp-hungry miner saw them . There was a big uproar over this , since some claimed those loafer Indians were sure not worth fifty dollars apiece . " At the mention of the two Indians who had murdered his grandfather , Turtleheart 's spine stiffened . As Hidetrader kept talking , he felt a tight bowstring inside of him loosen , and his body relaxed . The murder could never be undone , but the killing of the two eased his sad memories . He no longer would  | carry the lance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate that within two days time he was free of his two vows of vengeance . Turtleheart already knew the answer when he glanced at Strong Echo and back to Hidetrader , but he asked anyway . " We were at the Rosebud and the Little Big Horn battles , and now Sitting Bull would like to know if the white government is ready to meet in council with him ? " " Sit in council ? That does not enter into their plans . There is serious unrest among the whites , and they are crying for the Sioux to be crushed . Custer was a hero and you have destroyed him and his men , so now I fear there will be no talk at council . They mean to destroy the entire Sioux nation . " " What have we done that is not right ? Three Stars attacked us . Yellow Hair attacked us . We did the only thing we could do . Is it so terrible to fight for your families , your land , your right to live ? " Turtleheart 's voice rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not have to ask me these questions . I know you did right . The others ? All they want is your punishment , and the way things are now , it will be very severe . I know that I am telling you in cruel words , but you wanted to know and I have to tell you . We do not like these facts , but they must be faced . There will be no council . " Strong Echo clenched his right fist and smote his open hand . " This is unjust ! It is wrong to blame us . We are not guilty of any peace violations . The whites have committed all the violations , and we are to be punished for protecting our families ? " Strong Echo was on his feet , pacing the floor . " We are of the same thoughts , Strong Echo , but who are you ? " Jabbing his thumb into his own chest , Hidetrader practically shouted . " Who am I ? Well , I will tell you . We are nothing ! That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We are just Indians , you and I. All we can do is hope for the best and expect the worst . " The old man slumped down onto a buffalo robe , his breath coming in gasps . " Tell me , where is old Sitting Bull now ? "  | " Probably on his way to the Redcoat country with his followers . " " Good . That is the best thing he could do right now . I know the government is more fair up there . He will be safe as long as he stays . Where are you going ? Maybe follow Sitting Bull ? You will be smart if you do . " " No , we are going back to Red Cloud , back to the reservation , and try to make the best of what is to come . " Turtleheart turned to Strong Echo and said , " It grows dark now . It is time to leave so we can travel at night . " " What is your hurry . You just got here . Both of you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay here and leave tomorrow night . No one ever comes around and I will be here to keep watch while you sleep . I insist that you stay . " The two Indians looked at each other for a moment , then nodded their heads in the affirmative . " Now you are getting smart . This calls for good friends to have a drink . " Hidetrader now smiled as he poured whiskey into three tin cups . As he raised one cup , Hidetrader spoke his thoughts . " If old Sitting Bull is in Canada , I will be seeing him soon . I need to get away from this place for a few seasons , and the north country is where I want to go . " Turtleheart raised his cup a little apprehensively , and made a sour face as he sniffed the contents . The smell was repulsive . So this was the firewater he had heard so much about . He remembered the words of the wise elders of the tribe as they expressed their dislike for whiskey and those who drank it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips and downed the whiskey in one quick swallow . Hidetrader now said , " You do not need to drink this . " Turtleheart stuttered in reply , " I , ah , I. Oh , I may as well sample this poison . I , uh , just want to know why this is a curse to my people . " He put the cup to his mouth and emptied  | it with one gulp . The hot taste took his breath away and he stood there sputtering . As the whiskey reached his stomach , he suddenly belched . They all laughed and Hidetrader winked at Strong Echo . He filled the cups again . " If Turtleheart is a stranger to the effects of whiskey , it is time he became acquainted . Yes , well acquainted . " Strong Echo licked his lips . " Me , " he said . " I can drink this , but I do not do so because it is a curse to the Indian . Tonight I will drink with you Hidetrader , because I know you will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks , Turtleheart 's eyes were shining brightly , and as he watched the flickering candle flames , he suddenly became aware of their foreign origin . " Get those white man lights away from me . Do you hear , take them away ! " " Turtleheart , you can hardly see in the light . How could you see in the dark ? " Strong Echo was leaning toward him . Turtleheart gave a violent shove and both landed on the floor . Strong Echo got up immediately , but Turtleheart just turned over and started to snore softly . Hidetrader just smiled as he covered the sleeping form with a robe . The following morning , Strong Echo was the first to wake . His movements woke Hidetrader and the two of them started to cook breakfast . It was not long before Strong Echo noticed the robe move . " Ho , Turtleheart , " he cried out . " How does the drunk feel this fine morning ? " The two cooks roared with laughter . " You should have cheered us with wise advice instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night with your buffalo bull snores . " Turtleheart shook his head as he sat up . " I do not like the smell of whiskey . I do not like the taste . I do not like the effects . My head feels wide enough to put a tree between my ears , and you laugh . "  | " That is what happens to pure people . We are not pure , so we do not have that problem . Ho , Turtleheart , how about a good , stiff drink to wake you up ? " " NO ! Give it to our enemies , the blue coats , so we can just push them over . "  | In the sluggish moments of awakening , Turtleheart 's mind was not yet answerable to his will , but he remembered that catastrophe had come . It would be upon him the instant he became fully awake . He wished he could fall back into the it vacuum of sleep forever . The more he tried , the closer he came to a full wakefulness . He opened his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew where he was . He remembered fully the details of the day before , and in his stomach area was an odd feeling . Yesterday he and Strong Echo had ridden into the agency and handed over their guns . The government agent also demanded their horses , reminding them that only Indian police and Army scouts were permitted to carry guns , and one horse would be allowed per family . Strong Echo applied for work at the agency and Turtleheart accepted the invitation to stay with the Blue Thunder family on Wounded Knee Creek . All of his world had been swept away from him . He felt lost and lonely as he stared at the canvas overhead . At the agency he was instructed to start a new way of life with new lights and new ideals . What lights ' ? What ideals ? His mind was conscious of the fact that he was utterly broken . He had nothing , only the clothes on his back , the winter count , and the bag of dried food issued to him . Turtleheart remembered the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a renegade ; a person fighting  | against your own nation . " He did not understand what the man said , but he was glad that he did not tell that he had participated in the Rosebud and Greasy Grass battles . As he lay there in the tent he pondered on hips past life and was thankful Evensigh was not around to see and to feel this new kind of sadness . He wondered where she was . The white man had said she went back east to live with the whites . The door flap was open , but he did not notice it , so engrossed in his own misery was he . Then a voice penetrated the fog in which his mind moved . " Turtleheart . " It was a man 's voice . " Turtleheart , come out and receive the benediction of the sun on your head . You will feel better . " The elder Blue Thunder stood before him , his face narrow with high , protruding cheek bones . His face and frame bore the marks of many winters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seemed to drive away the chill in his bones . The bowl of Indian tea he drank made him relax . The elder Blue Thunder came over with a handful of government beans and announced with the air of the knowing , " See these round white man 's rocks ? They are supposed to be eaten . My daughter-in-law , Alice , will be cooking them soon . She will have to cook them almost all day before they are soft enough to eat . " " Father ! Are you trying to get him to eat those stones ? " A middle-aged woman had joined the conversation . " As soon as Jim and the kids return with more firewood , I 'll show Turtleheart how to cook them . This noon we will eat the baby teeth . " She smiled at Turtleheart 's look of disbelief . " Do not worry . Baby teeth is what I call government rice . " " Here come your firewood pickers , Alice , " said Blue Thunder , pointing to the curve of the creek . Three figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way toward them . To Turtleheart this was astounding . Men getting fire-wood ? " Last winter , when he registered at Red Cloud 's agency , they gave my boy a new name . " The old man shifted his weight from one foot to the other . " It took a little time , but  | he got used to it ; the name they gave him . Jim Blue Thunder . Mine is David . My grandson here is Douglas , and he is twelve . My granddaughter is Mercy and she is nine . It took us many moons to get used to having different front names and the same back name . " " They added to my name too , " exclaimed Turtleheart . " I am supposed to be William Turtleheart . " He wished he could say it with a proud boast , but the name was strange and given at random . It meant nothing to him . " Blue Thunder , do you see that little hill over there ? Across the creek ? Look carefully , see that small pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried . " After a moment he added , " My Evensigh 's real parents are buried there too . " " I know that all too well , Turtleheart . It was many years ago when your grandfather told me the story . " " Do the others know ? " Turtleheart asked in surprise . " Of the few families who live along this creek , I am probably the only one who remembers the day Chiefeagle brought you and Evensigh back to camp . We were visiting his band that time . " Blue Thunder wrinkled his forehead in thought . " Yes , I do remember that it was a chilly early morning during the moon of when the buffalo calves are born . Your grandfather and Hidetrader stormed into camp with you two little ones . Evensigh must have been nearly one winter in age , and you we guessed to be in your third year . " " I did not know you knew Grandfather back that far . " " Turtleheart , my pride is wounded that no one told you . Chiefeagle 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bear band when the Sioux first came to this territory . As a young man I chose Chiefeagle as my Hunka Ate . " " Your words astonish me , but I am hearing good words , Blue Thunder . Tell me , what did grandfather say when he brought us back into camp ? How did the camp accept us ? " Turtleheart was hoping to hear something new on the subject .  | He had heard the story many times from his grandfather and each time the story brought out something new . " Be patient and I will tell you . This has been long ago . " Blue Thunder cautioned . " He and Hidetrader trotted their horses into camp with you two in their arms . Yes , Chiefeagle had you wrapped in a small robe . They appealed to the women for help , and you know women . They practically tore you from your grandfather 's arms to make over you , especially when they found you were both orphans . Ah yes , there were many disappointed families when Chiefeagle finally decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his own . " " Later that season , your grandfather brought me down here to show me the burial mound and he told me the whole story . He said they were returning from the Good Voice band and the sun was already set when they smelled smoke . They left the trail to search and found the smoldering ruins of two wagons . A child 's cries brought him down off his pony to find a weeping girl concealed beneath the skirt of a dead white woman . There were no marks of injury on her but there was a bullet hole in the head of the white man . " " While digging the burial hole , he noticed another dark object further down the slope . He ran to the spot and found you lying naked on your cold mother . She still clasped the hand of your dead father . He said you tried to smile , but it was your black eyes that conveyed a feeling of trust . " Blue Thunder had to pause for a moment after his long oration . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth . " They never found out who the killers were , but from what they found , they knew they were not Indian , to leave babies . " They sat silent for a couple of moments . " Your names , yes , your names , " Blue Thunder was thinking back over the years . " Chiefeagle said that the little girl cried outwardly all the way back to camp , so he named her Evensigh . You , you never made a sound , so he said you had a strong heart and he named you Turtleheart. "  | " Chiefeagle sent runners to all of the bands to find out who your parents were . " Blue Thunder stopped and looked straight at Turtleheart before adding , " Anyway , you are an Indian , you have our skin color . That is all I can tell you . " Alice brought in some firewood and they watched her as she arranged it on the ground . " How do you feel , Turtleheart ? " Jim asked . " Like a , well a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed at his wry answer and the boyish grimace on his face . " It is good to see you laugh , Turtleheart . " " Blue Thunder , where are the families who belonged to the Bushy Band ? " " The few that live on the Wounded Knee Creek are all that remain in our band . Many of the young warriors joined Crazy Horse , Iron Shield , Hump and Gall . They have never returned . Some of the families went out to the soldier settlements to loaf and to drink firewater . " " Brother has turned against brother to seek favor with the winning side . Everything changes too fast . Our band , at least what is left of it , is in a coma of hopelessness . " " By order of the Indian police , we are not permitted to bring our lodges together as we once did . Our small band is scattered along the Wounded Knee Creek for about three miles . " Jim had added to his father 's explanation . " How many horses do you have ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family can have one and that is all . If we need another , we borrow one from the other families . I think our band has a total of fourteen horses and three colts . " Jim turned to his father for confirmation and Blue Thunder nodded in accord . " Handing out food to us is not a good thing , " Blue Thunder was speaking . " To some of the people it is an encouragement to seek more , even by unfair methods . To the rest of us , it is the same as taking the heart out of us . All of this is bad and leaves us in despair . It has drawn us closer in brotherhood as we along this creek have learned to share our sadness so it does not hurt so much any more . "  | " We have four wagons , " said Jim . " They are owned by the families along the creek , and we all use them to haul water from the springs and to gather firewood . " " The wagons . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Blue Thunder was chuckling . " Father , tell Turtleheart about them , " Jim encouraged the old man . " That was a good joke on us . " " We were all told to go to the agency for government rations , " Blue Thunder began . " Most of us walked the seven-. teen miles . When we got there , there were big piles of food to be given to all the people . I never in my whole life saw so much at one place . " " Along with our regular rations there were some round loaves of something the whites call bread . Ptew ! " He made a grimace at the thought of the tasteless loaves . " Each one who received these tasteless things was also given a can of . wagon grease . One soldier told us to put some on the bread to make it taste better . Well , I have not felt the same since . " He was grinning broadly . " That is not all of it . " Jim interjected . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on us , so we all laughed too . Then a soldier told us to spread the wagon grease on the wagons . Brave Elk received a wagon frame without the box . They did not tell us that the boxes were coming in later . Anyway , I helped Brave Elk spread the black grease all over his wagon ; the frame , the tongue . We ran out of grease . We were standing there wondering how the ignorant pale faces could stand to ride those greasy frames , when some agency men came around and started to laugh . I thought it funny too , but you should have seen Brave Elk . He started to throw anything he could get his hands on . I have never seen anyone so angry . " As the laughter died down , Strong Echo rode up , reining an extra horse . He dropped to the ground and went directly to Turtleheart . Bluntly , he uttered words which caused the smiles to leave . " Nearly all of Iron Shield 's band have been killed . They  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few escaped , but all the rest , all the women and children , even Iron Shield , are dead . " " My grandmother is ... ? " anxiously queried Turtleheart . " My heart lies on the ground . The only ones who escaped were the young warriors who could outrun the soldiers . " Turtleheart rose and philosophically said , " In my heart , I knew I would never see my grandmother again . When she left the Greasy Grass with Iron Shield , my heart told me that was the last time I would hear her voice : No , I am not surprised , but I am deeply hurt to lose the last one of my family . " Reaching beneath his buckskin shirt , Turt1 ? heart untied the winter count which was about his waist and pulled it out . " This is my personal winter count . She gave this to me to keep up on my years . My grandfather started it when he found me on that hill . After he was killed , grandmother passed it on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most interesting , " said Blue Thunder . " Now I must record my grandmother 's death . " He unrolled it for all to see . " What is so different about a personal winter count ? " It was Strong Echo who asked the question . " As you know , winter counts portray history , " Blue Thunder explained . " All bands have to have some sort of calendar , a method of recalling events of the past . The winter counts are kept by the winters , not like the white man 's calendar of the years , months and days . " Blue Thunder paused to breathe deeply . " In each band , the keeper of the calendar consulted with the elders to decide the most notable event for that year . When this was done , he drew a picture on the tanned hide . Each picture tells of a year . " " This winter count is different . It does not tell of the band , but of Turtleheart . It is his personal history . " " Hah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I can see where it can be favored by an individual , " said Strong Echo .  | " You have just come from the agency ? " asked Jim . " Is there any other news from there ? " " I have not been there long enough to be trusted , so I do not have any particular duty . I do odd jobs such as filling in as interpreter , messenger . The government men are facing quite a task in running the reservation with more and more of our people returning . I hear that the white chiefs are hamstrung by differences of opinion in their own ranks . " " See if you can get them to increase our food rations , " said Blue Thunder . " Yours is not the only complaint . I have heard many others complain of the rations being smaller each time . " " What do you hear of the rumor that the government people are going to make farmers of us instead of hunters ? Is this true ? There is much talk about this , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Maybe the government men do talk of this , I do not know . Last night , " Strong Echo confided , " I was at a meeting and the agency , men told us to forget our old way of life . We stand between the old and the new way of living . If we wish to survive , we must break with the past and face the new . At least that is what he said . They must have a plan . " " I am afraid many of us can not wipe from our minds the past , Strong Echo . I can not forget the days when there were more of the buffalo than of the arrows owned by the entire Tetonwan . " Blue Thunder spoke with quivering words . " When I think of the old days and compare them with the new , I am ashamed . We used to hunt for food , now we have to beg for what little we get . We go in fear and frustration . Now they talk of making us farmers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will to disturb the bosom of Maka Ina . " " Do not worry . They will help us to be farmers , " Strong Echo reassured the old man . Then to change the subject to one not so disturbing , he turned toward Turtleheart . " I told them about you at the agency , and they would like to have you on the Indian police . If you agree , this horse is yours to use . "  | Turtleheart looked longingly at the animal before speaking . " I would rather be on foot than to be a white man 's dog soldier . My wounds are too deep . I have not forgotten my pains and my sorrows . I can not forget my distrust of the white man . " " Well , maybe later on . " Strong Echo said sympathetically . This was the first time that Turtleheart ever felt anger against Strong Echo rise in his mind . He rose and left the gathering without answering . Soon this feeling turned to an anger against himself , and he knew he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his decision and caught Blue Thunder away from the others . " Blue Thunder , like the wind , I know no direction . I must find myself . It is on my mind that I must go on a vision quest . I have decided I must seek a sign , some advice . Maybe a vision will come . " " Turtleheart , " Blue Thunder began as he put is hands on the young man 's shoulders . " I am glad to hear you say you wish to walk in our ancient moccasins . You are mixed up right now , and a vision quest will ease your mind and give you the direction . You will know what you must do . Yes , you will know . "  | Early the next morning , Turtleheart went to see an ancient looking medicine man . He had to get the advice of the elder on what was expected of him and to get his blessing . This man of medical knowledge would also give him the interpretation of his vision . Having been instructed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraped buffalo hide . He was ready to set out for his lonely vigil with the unknown , his vision quest . In his hand he carried a pipe . Attached to the thong of his breechclout was a pouch containing tobacco and whole leaves of the elm tree . Bear Mountain was his choice for the vision quest as it was the highest point in the whole territory . He set out at a strong pace in the early morning sunshine , and by the next day he had reached the old Sioux hunting grounds . From here he could see Bear Mountain looming in the distance . The ground was barren of wild game ; there was no buffalo sign . This was already becoming a void passage land for the whites who wanted the land of the Paha Sapa . By early afternoon of the second day , Turtleheart stood at the base of the mountain . As he looked at the sky , he noticed the clouds of an impending storm form over the peaks . He filled his lungs with the fresh air of the green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plains to the east , where his band lived .  | Turtleheart searched the tall spruce of the forest and he listened to the noisy communication of the leaves of the bushes . This was an enchantment he had not experienced for a long time . How comforting the nature of the forest is . How smooth and how beautiful , with everything well balanced and in tune . How protective she is by leaning over him , providing him cool shade . The last time he was with Evensigh , it was in a place much like this . The poignant memory of her fingers caressing his cheek made the old days seem like a dream , something which perhaps never happened at all . Turtleheart renewed his trek up the slope , the wind now moist with the smell of rain . Let it rain . He would not seek shelter . This was the prime enjoyment of life , life in the clasp of mother earth . It was nearly in the evening when he reached the top of Bear Mountain . The sun was just beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slanted rays struck the rock of the summit . Below him , the forested slopes he had come through were already caught in the darkness of dusk . The animal dwellers of the forest were busy preparing for the night . A wide valley stretched endlessly north and west , its lower reaches lost in the darkness . In the valley were low hills , humped against each other , their dark patches of pine indistinct with the approach of night . He marveled at the beauty of the tops of the hills as they tried to stay in the fading light , as if afraid to succumb to the dark . Along the tops of the Paha Sapa Mountains , the sun 's coloring of the clouds turned from blood red to purple to a blackish gray . Suddenly there was no color and the wind sighed at its passing . The warmth of day was fast disappearing , so Turtleheart wrapped himself in the buffalo robe , and with his back against the trunk of a great tree , he waited for the long shadows of night to swallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he listened to the many voices of the wind as it swept through the tall pines .  | As he lay there , the events of the past and the uncertainty of the future kept his mind in a turmoil . He lost all track of time and was not conscious of going to sleep . The purple hues of dawn were just beginning when he roused from his cramped and uncomfortable position . Rising to stretch his full length , he stood erect with the pipe to the east , to wait for the sun . When the sun showed its forehead , Turtleheart sang his prayer . " Wakan Tanka , the Giver of all that my eyes can see and that my mind can feel , I offer to You , through Your power the sun , my humble thoughts . I stand here in solitude and pray . I pray with all my inner strength , that You will take pity on me , that You will be good enough to smile at my mistakes . In my humble way , I live a life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious rituals of our tribal priests . You are the only one who knows that this is the right way ; so with a deep sense of humility , I seek Your way through my belief . I pray that it is Your will that You may give me strength to meet the tomorrows ... " The chant which emanated from the lips of the earnest young warrior was low in tone and slow in delivery . As he stood there , his hands and arms became increasingly heavy . And although he allowed his head to drop forward until his chin was against his chest , he did not waver . His voice was now a mere whisper . His fingers were turning numb from grasping the pipe . At last , the pain in his arms became so great , it disturbed his sense of balance . Only then did he lower his pipe . By this time the sun was streaming over the countryside . The slow , warm breeze drifted westward as though carrying the warm rays of the sun with it . Turtleheart inhaled the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this exercise . An uncontrollable urge to shiver seized him , not because it was cold , but because of the thrill of the experience . He had the feeling of floating into eternity . All morning he stood facing the sun and holding the pipe , while praying for enlightenment by invoking the powers of  | the Holy Mystery . While meditating on this quest he would touch neither food nor water for three days and three nights . At mid-day , when the sun was about to slip over into the western sky , Turtleheart raised his pipe to the four cardinal points and again stood motionless while offering his pipe to the symbol of the Holy Power . He stood there until no longer had he strength to continue . Late that afternoon , pangs of hunger gripped his vitals . His legs felt paralyzed from standing in one position , and his feet ached with pain . By shifting his weight from one foot to the other he could lessen some of the discomfort , but the hunger was nearly beyond bearing . Finally , he dipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the elm leaves . This he consumed to help quell the twinges of hunger . His people had always eaten these leaves to quiet the contractions of an empty stomach . As the sun approached the western horizon , Turtleheart again raised his pipe to the sun and repeated his tiring ritual . He had been conscious of it before , but now he found that it was becoming very arduous and difficult to hold the pipe to the setting sun . After an interminable time , the glowing orb disappeared from sight and Turtleheart was no longer able to trace its path . It was pure torture to make his way to his robe . Dropping to the earth and hardly able to move , he was satisfied with his day 's expression of penitence . Turtleheart had been taught from childhood that the reasoning behind a vision quest is primarily for the purpose of having Wakan Tanka 's reflections accepted by the candidate . This was accomplished through intercessors ; through any living object of nature . The only way for a candidate to be successful in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities . Any human intervention during the quest would doom it to failure . Consciousness of self and self alone must be attained . When this occurs , the light of the vision rises in the mind . The mind may then be said to have penetrated itself , permitting the vision .  | The mystical men believed that a man must have knowledge of these sacred and deep feelings within the mind and body before the total self could be attained . Only too soon there was the dawn of another day . Wearily Turtleheart rose to meet the day 's ordeal . He put a leaf of the elm in his mouth , picked up the pipe , and moving away from the tall pine , faced the east to await the sun . As it began to appear over the horizon , he raised the pipe and began to pray in a low chant . " Close my mind to cowardice . Let me do the right things for my people . Not for the sake of merit , but because of the sacrifice of my people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun , breaking away from the eastern prairies , poured a sudden radiance of gold upon the tops of the mountains . He wished then , that the meaning of his own heart could be put into words . Surely then , Wakan Tanka would know his real thoughts . This day was a repetition of the previous day , but he was more weary in mind and body . It was little comfort to him that the afternoon became stifling hot , with no cooling breeze . As the day ended he felt a relief of mind and body . There was peace and indolence . As he fell asleep , the land itself seemed to sleep . During the dark of the night , Turtleheart heard a beautiful melody . It seemed to originate a long way off , but it was coming closer and closer . The sweet melodious voice enchanted every fibre of his body , and it somehow seemed familiar . Evensigh ! The thought of Evensigh caused him to raise up , his ears straining to hear . The soothing melody continued . He raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to find the direction from which the song came . Now he was sure he was awake , and he could still hear Evensigh 's voice . Thinking the voice came from the scrub oak , he ran to each clump expectantly . With soaring spirits , he was realizing her voice was coming from the sky . Scanning the sky , he  | could see nothing but darkness , and her voice was coming from the whole sky . He could hear her very clearly now . His heart was thumping as he felt utter despair settle upon him . " She is in the land of our ancestors , " he cried . In answer , her voice moved to the east and the haunting melody receded into the distance until there was no sound except the whispering of the wind through the tall pines . Turtleheart could feel all of the strength in his body leaving him . He faced the east , feeling remorse and a complete loneliness . He could sense how inadequate human character is during times of extreme distress . His legs could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , the pipe still grasped in his hands . Sleeping fitfully , he awaited the coming of the third sunrise , when somehow , he found the strength to rise . All morning of the third day , he stood facing the sun as before , and repeated the invocations of the two previous days . His eyes were almost swollen shut from staring at the sun . At noon his pipe offering was very short and his chant but a moving of the lips . In the manner of a blind person he felt for the bag at his waist , looking for the elm leaves . His mouth was extremely dry and as he bit down on the leaf , there was no trickle of saliva to moisten it . Easing the particles past his swollen tongue , the ticklish bits of elm started a feeling of regurgitation , He felt he was trying to swallow handfuls of young eagle feathers . The thought was amusing and he felt much better . During the afternoon he felt the sensation of little puffs of cool air touching at points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stifling , so he was afraid to open his eyes , as that might disturb the pure relief of the coolness . The puffs grew stronger until the strange sensation of flying birds was vivid in his mind . He could even hear the fluttering of wings as they breezed about his torso and the calves of his legs .  | Again he heard the sweet melodious voice of Evensigh . The soothing caress of her low voice was pure enchantment . Quickly , he opened his eyes , fully expecting to see her . She was not there and the fluttering bird wings were gone . The sound of her voice still continued from above . It was raining . The whole countryside was being rained upon , but none of it touched him . Where he stood there was no rain . Curiosity made him step forward and extend his hand out beyond the edge of his position . The drops of rain fell against his upturned palm , and he withdrew his hand to dab at his parched lips with the moistened fingers . Turning , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knelt to pull at the wet grass . The singing voice of Evensigh was wafted to him on the eastern breeze . Wonderment filled Turtleheart . He was having a vision . When the rain stopped , Turtleheart knew that his vision quest was successful . Upon returning to the Wounded Knee area , the success of the quest was immediately noticeable to the people . On his way to the medicine man , his body exhibited more strength instead of weakness after the days of the fast . The people were glad for him and everyone shared his pride .  | Every day of the passing season , Turtleheart hunted the creek beds , the prairie hills , the flats , for small game . Always on foot , he was sometimes gone for two or three days at a time , but he usually returned with the wild fowl or a rabbit . At first he roamed the countryside to assuage the pain and shame of being a reservation Indian . With the passing of summer , he began to realize the true value of silence . Silence was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a priceless commodity . Much wisdom could be attained within its domain . It uncovered truth , bliss and sorrow , but it made him forget the sorrow for himself . He now gave very little thought to the old days , even when he thought of Evensigh . Only occasionally did he brood about the past or the invaders or become rankled at the defeat of his people . When the north winds came with their lingering alarms , moaning a dirge across the country , he watched them squeeze the color out of the evening sky and beat against the cottonwoods to capture the last leaf . He saw autumn laying upon the earth its own colors of red , orange , yellow and brown . When the pattern was ready , the white mantle spread down from the hidden shake of the sky . The snow-on-snow robed the earth and drifted deep in the gulches , to bring a beautiful but desolate look to the land . The cold was so intense it hurt the lungs to breathe deeply . The hunger was felt by the people because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the spring when the government food rations grew meager , the spotted disease of the white man fell upon the Indians in their weakened condition . It came unannounced  | and unwelcome to spread until Wounded Knee Valley was filled with it . Those who recovered were marked by the deep pits to remind them of its terrible toll . There were many who did not recover . The old , the young , the weak . Nearly every family raised the death chant that miserable spring . The people felt that death lurked in the very air they breathed . The wave of disease took the lives of Douglas , the mischievous one ; and Mercy with her wide eyed smiles . Blue Thunder took the loss of his grandchildren very hard , and for weeks he was not himself . He did not act like the Yuwipi man of the Sioux band . His face became very old , his actions very slow and tired . Several weeks after the deaths of the two children , Strong Echo came again to the valley , reining a spare horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated and tossed the younger man a pair of woolen trousers . " Kola ! I brought these for you . I thought you might have use for them , " he said as he slid off the horse to squat on the ground . Turtleheart smiled . " I suppose I could , " he answered after giving the pants a quick appraisal . " My leggins are in need of patching , and hides are hard to come by . " He rose and went in the tipi . In a matter of a few breaths he emerged , wearing the serge trousers . " A perfect fit , " Strong Echo commented . " I feel foolish in them , but they are comfortable . " " We were discussing dreams when you rode up , " said Blue Thunder . " Will you join us ? " Strong Echo enjoyed a good discussion as well as the next Indian , but courtesy demanded that he not seem too interested . " I did not mean to interrupt your talk , " he ventured . A chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about dreams was an opportunity he did not intend to let slip by . When no one spoke , he cleared his throat slightly , and to encourage the discussion he said , " Dreams are of many kinds . How do you classify them , Blue Thunder ? "
