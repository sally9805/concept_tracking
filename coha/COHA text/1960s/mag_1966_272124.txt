Fattening the Record Book <P> Before it blasted off from Cape Kennedy last week , the two-man spacecraft Gemini 10 faced a flight plan that was easily the most complex and ambitious ever designed for U.S. astronauts . By the time they splashed into the Atlantic after three days in orbit , Gemini 's crew had collected an impressive variety of space-age records . With one after an other intricate exercise , Command Pilot John Young and his colleague , Michael Collins , wrote bright new chapters into the record book of space travel . <P> Gemini 10 became the first spaceship ever to use the fuel and propulsion system of another craft to power its own flight ; it demonstrated the feasibility of refueling in space , a technique that promises to be a vital part of interplanetary travel to Mars and beyond . Gemini was also the first spacecraft to rendezvous with two different vehicles on the same flight . It flew higher than any previous manned spacecraft and Astronaut Mike Collins , at 35 , became the first man to work outside , his ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. far ahead of Russia in almost every area of manned in space flight . rendezvous and With their docking while singular aloft skills-which the Russians have not yet begun to try-U.S. spacemen moved closer than ever to the moon . <P> Ominous Shortage . Using the knowledge of orbital mechanics that had been refined during earlier Gemini missions , Young and Collins gradually maneuvered toward a rendezvous with the Agena 10 target vehicle that had been placed in orbit with a precise launch just 100 minutes before their own blastoff . They established radar contact with the Agena 10 during their second revolution , finally sighted the target some 50 miles ahead and 17 miles above . After rising to meet the Agena and nudging Gemini 's nose into the Agena 's receiving collar , Young coupled the two ships . <P> Though the rendezvous and docking seemed almost routine , Houston controllers were shocked when Young reported that Gemini had only 380 lbs . of fuel left , about 36% of its original supply . Somehow the catch-up maneuvers during the last 25 minutes before rendezvous had consumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it was , Gemini 's sudden fuel shortage provided Agena with an added opportunity to demonstrate that one spacecraft can use another 's propulsion and control systems . On orders from Houston , the astronauts shut down Gemini 's thrusters ; for the remainder of the coupled flight , they used only Agena 's power for both attitude and major orbital maneuvers , drawing on Agena 's 3,348 lbs . of remaining propellant . One brief burst from Agena 's big , 16,000-lb. - thrust engine added 280 m.p.h. to Gemini-Agena 's velocity . " When that baby lights , there 's no doubt about it , " gasped Young .
