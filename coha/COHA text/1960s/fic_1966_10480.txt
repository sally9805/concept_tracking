Walter has worked hard for what he has , and Walter deserves it . He may seem a little precious now , there may be an air of dignity slightly greater ( if that be possible ) than the responsibility he actually carries , but it is not a small responsibility and he has not achieved it lightly . Patsy may regard him with the spiteful attitude with which she regards most people , Helen-Anne from the vantage point of a special knowledge may feel and express a disenchantment more blunt and open than many dare , the Knoxes may be skeptical , Ted Jason , the President , and many another ambitious politician domestic and foreign may think that they play upon his ego to use him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Walter Dobius is not exactly where he should be .

If he has enemies , they are mute . When Walter speaks , the world literally listens . But it was not always so . Indeed , when he pauses sometimes to reflect upon his early years  --  and he does so , quite conscientiously , two or three times a week , because , as he once told Helen-Anne ( not entirely , as she knew , in jest ) " it keeps me humble "  --  he is struck with a certain wonderment that he should have reached the pinnacle he has .

When his father brought the family from Saxony 's L.unehnrger Heath to America , Walter was two ( his memory of the bogs and moors not quite so vivid , perhaps , as in later years he has become fond of recountingfrom the public platform ) . The job his father found , that of a meat cutter in Philadelphia , did not give his family much promise of an affluent future . For most of Walter 's childhood and adolescence this remained true . The memory of always living in near-poverty , or on the edge of it , has proved a great goad to the family 's second son .

He emerged from a grueling childhood with a grim inner determination that he was someday going to get out of all this and never turn back . Suddenly in high school he found the means . He discovered that he had been blessed with a certain ability to use words , and with it an air of authority that persuaded his teachers and contemporaries that he wrote with a perception and force unusually impressive in an adolescent . He was on his way . With this gift  --  " The Lord was good to me , in my talent , " he had remarked in the same Columbia School of Journalism speech that had provoked such hosannas from his hearers and the press  --  " and I have tried to be faithful to Him , in my use of it "  --  went a native doggedness and diligence that made of young Walter Dobius one of the hardestTheWorld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edit the school paper and graduate with top honors while doing so . Hard work marked him then and hard work marks him now , filled with honors and power as he is . To this day , Walter Dobius does not relax . He performed then , and he still does , the hard , patient , relentless digging that is the mark of the top reporter . Whenever a big story broke on campus , in high school or later at Yale , where he edited the Daily , Walter was there , his sturdy figure trudging into the thick of it , pencil raised , voice insistent , asking his blunt , demanding questions until he got the answers . Whenever a big story breaks in Washington now , Walter is there , his sturdy figure trudging down the corridors of State Department or Senate , emerging from inside closed committee hearings and secret international conferences ( " Now , how the hell did Walter get in there ? " his exasperated colleagues demand of one another , but only a secret little smile around his lips betrays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ) , getting exclusive interviews with visiting heads of state , standing at the President 's elbow as he delivers his latest pronouncement on the crises of a disintegrating world . Walter is there because he is Walter Dobius , friend of the mighty , just as he was there in school days because he was Walter Dobius , friend of the mighty . But he is also there , and always has been , because he is Walter Dobius , magnificent and indefatigable reporter . It is the foundation of his fame and the true basis of his power ; and it is the element which perhaps more than any other gives his words the weight they have . " Walter is a pompous , patronizing , insufferable sh . . . owoff , " one of his most famous colleagues remarked thoughtfully one night in the Press Club bar , " but he does go to the source . " And the sources go to Walter and together  --  or so he tells himself with a secret pleasure he would be inhuman not to feel  --  they run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the truth . Two or three times a year in London , for instance , the phone will ring at No. io Downing Street and the familiarly casual , heavy voice will say , " Reggie ? " ( or " Harold ?

" And Harold  --  or Reggie  --  will obediently drop everything and oblige , aware that behind the voice lie 436 newspapers , an internationalreputation , and  --  perhaps  --  the key to swaying the opinions of a baffling and erratic ally . Similarly from Moscow or Peking , Paris or New Delhi , there will come from time to time the impossible-to-get interview , the exclusive revelation , handed down by men who find in44 Capable of HonorWalter the surest road to the world 's front pages , the most effective channel through which to disclose their purposes and threaten , or cajole , the hearts and minds of men . ) Out of the high school editorship , however , out of Yale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . There followed a dark period of several years during which the future sage somehow failed to find his place . It was the only time in his life when he came close to doubting himself . He began with a good job on the Hartford Courant . At once he ran into trouble . Possibly , as he long ago became convinced , it was the difficultpersonalities of his fellow workers that started their immediate mistrust and misunderstanding . Possibly , as one of them indicated years later in a witty and quickly discredited article in National Reviewentitled , " I Remember Walter , " it was his own personality which was at fault . In any event a clash was immediate . Somehow his colleagues got the unjust and unwarranted idea that Walter was after their jobs  --  not anyone 's in particular , just that of whoever happened to be in his way . Actually , it was just that Walter , in his usual hard-working fashion , seemed to get there first on every good assignment . This went on for some eight months , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving ten minutes late for an interview with the governor , found Walter already deep in earnest conversation with him behind closed doors and got the unfortunate impression that Walter was after his job . An ultimatum to the editor followed , and with a mixture of reluctance because he recognized Walter 's abilities , and compliance , because he recognized his all-consuming drive for power , the editor suggested that Walter might prefer a larger arena for his talents . The editor murmured vaguely of New York and Washington , confident that in those competitive jungles Walter would either go under or hit the top . Nowadays , long since retired in Darien , he is fond of recounting how certain he was that Walter would do the latter . But Walter did n't get that impression then , and it was only years later , when he was in the process of mellowing his image all along the line , that he had invited the editor to introduce him when he spoke to the annual convention of the American Society of Newspaper Editors in Washington . On a wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fondly fancied themselves to be in the same position of constantly helping to boost brilliant young talent up the ladder to success , the hostile aspects of Walter 's parting from his old boss had been blurred out and the event had been riveted finally into legend in the form in which both he and Walter now preferred it . The World of Walter Wonderful 45At the time , however , the event had been quite shattering , though then , as now , he did not show his feelings to the world . For several days he went through a considerable hell , wondering quite seriously whether there was any place in his chosen profession for conscientious talent and genuine ability . It had honestly never occurred to him  --  and it has not occurred to him since  --  that he might be treading on other people 's feelings . He quite genuinely did not realize that it is possible to be ruthless with a certain grace that can save it from being cruel . " The thing I love about Walter , " Helen-Anne remarked years later , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a curious pain came into her eyes that startled her listeners . " Poor devil , " she added , and abruptly changed the subject with some profane comment on the First Lady that diverted them into forgetting laughter . To this day Walter honestly does not know that he has hurt people along the way , or that he is still hurting them , in his column and in his speeches and , sometimes , in his personal relationships ( though these in recent years have been cut to a minimum to permit him more freedom to concentrate upon his work ) . He just knows that he has certain things to say and certain things to do , and if others get in the way he considers it unfortunate but their own fault for not understanding that their wishes must be subordinate to his . Toward Orrin Knox , for instance , he is sure he has only the kindliest personal feelings but he also knows that Orrin should not be President . In the defeat of that misguided and dangerous ambition any misrepresentationin the column is justified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For they do not seem so to Walter , any more than they do to others in his world . Walter , as he is fond of saying on the rare occasions when someone ventures to criticize him for a particularly savage column , would n't hurt a fly . More than that , he is conscientiously generousto those about him . With a sort of horrible , heavy-handed graciousnesshe goes about his world encouraging other correspondents , figuratively patting younger colleagues on the head ( providing they agree with him ) , giving fatherly advice to those whose own talents are sufficiently great that they can hardly bear to accept it with civility , and generally playing the part of the kindly senior squire . HelenAnnecalls him tactless , his older colleagues call him patronizing , but Walter is absolutely sincere about it . For all his brilliance , he has a childlike inability to sense or understand the personal feelings of others . It is perhaps no wonder Helen-Anne can still feel pain for Walter , who is so self-armored that he can not feel it for himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably a blessing , for it permitted him to gather himself together without too46 Capable of Honormuch difficulty and start off to the Washington upon which his heart had always been set . He had not planned to attack it quite so soon , but later this turned out to be the best thing that could have happened . Again , however , nothing came right at first , and again he went through several periods of doubt and despair . Working in turn for the Washington Times-Herald , and the Evening Star , he found himself frequently involved over four or five years in the same kind of difficultyhe encountered in Hartford . Everyone respected his talent and disliked his personality . Frictions  --  always due to the failure of others to understand him  --  were constant . Attempts to undercut others  --  always innocent , just because he was so hard-working  --  were frequent . The Times-Herald suffered it for a while and then fired him just before he finally decided that the paper 's conservative atmosphere was stifling him and he must get out . Time seriously considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had enough trouble with talented egos without giving permanent home to another . ( The decisionsuited them both . Briefly he had thought that a newsmagazine 's murderous anonymity might be a convenient shield behind which to attack the growing number of people and causes he considered dangerous to the country . But before they reached their decision not to hire him he had reached his not to accept . He decided that he was proud of his views and would stand by them . He was not afraid , ashamed , or jealous , so he did not need the nameless knifer 's cloak . ) The Evening Star , in its easygoing , tolerant way , endured him for a couple of years until it , too , without ever quite saying so , indicated that he would probably be happier elsewhere . Frustrated and depressed , he came at last to the town 's most intolerant , most slanted , most ruthless and most powerful publication , and found that they were made for each other . Swiftly he learned the knack of the prejudicial word , the smoothly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bland omission of friendly facts , the deliberate suppression of honors and achievements , the heavy dependence upon unidentified " informed sources " who believed , or stated , or predicted , or thought , unfavorable and unkind things about the chosen targets of editorial disapproval . ( His writing , as it became more savage under this tutelage , also for a while showed a tendency to become more precious : he was among the first to litter his copy with such self-conscious Anglicisms as " straight away , " " in the crunch , " and " early on . " And , although research never entirely confirmed it , he was generally believed to have been the originator of the term " hawks " for those who favored a responsibleThe World of Walter Wonderful 47firmness toward the Communists , " doves " for those who fled , wideeyedand tippy-toe , from the slightest show of force about anything . ) Within a year he was an editors ' pet , given carte blanche to roam where he would and trample whom he needed . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoops on the State Department 's waveringposition papers on Southeast Asia that made his by-line worldfamous , after an expose of an after-hours sex-ring on Capitol Hill that won him both the Raymond Clapper Memorial Award and his first Pulitzer , after a long series of analytical pieces on the two major political parties which gave his publication 's readers the point of view they felt they must have , he found himself at thirty with his own column and a contract for syndication that promised great things to come . And great things came , though for a while they were not as great as he wanted them to be , and certainly not as great as they were now . Dutifully , and often with considerable stylistic force , he upheld the Right Position . With intelligence and skill he urged America to follow a course that to many of his countrymen seemed to place her in everincreasingjeopardy . Smoothly he advised her to give up her idealistic dreams of a lasting peace and accept instead a condition of permanent negotiation and endless war . Logically and persuasively he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge the inevitable nature of accommodations with the Communists that would steadily weaken her power . All this he did in the name of a genuine personal conviction and a great determination to be In , not Out . Bitterly he attacked those who disagreed with him or deviated in the slightest from the rigid pattern of thinking beloved of his employers , his major colleagues , and himself . He spoke perfectly , in short , for that world in which he was coming to assume an increasingly prominent and commanding position . With an instinctive flair for the right words and phrases to synthesize its attitudes , he speedily became one of its best-known prophets in those days when it was just hitting its full stride in the campaign , always sincere and usually quite innocent , to cripple America and tie her hands in the face of an implacable enemy who used all means , includingthe eager if unconscious help of Walter and his world , to try to bring about her death . And still he was not where he wanted to be . There were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line : Walter Dobius was not unique . For all that his column began to pick up clients with a fair rapidity , it did not , as yet , have anything particularly special to offer . He began to think that it would not have as long as Big Walter lived48 Capable of Honorand he must work in his shadow , for as Bob Taft had so unnervingly noted , Little Walter more and more found himself thinking and writing along much the same lines and in much the same style . There was the same air of superior knowledge and infallible wisdom ; the same appeal to a higher reality above the law  --  and above the ideas of those who dared challenge the Right Position ; the same ridiculing of America 's naive belief that firmness and decency together might save the world ; even , on occasion , the same angry attacks upon candidates and leaders who dared to disagree with the policies that Big Walter  --  and Little  --  believed best for the country . It was not , in fact , until Big Walter joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into his own ; and then it was only because he had been shrewd enough to gather about him an aura of dispassionate disinterest that concealed his lively partisanemotions as successfully as his idol 's had . There had been a brief period when he had thought that excessive partisanship for a given candidate was the right road to fame and power , and for a year or two his columns were filled with undiluted praise for the Texan in the White House . But it turned out that Lyndon had other ideas , and aside from a good many intimate chats in which he was told how much he was loved and how much his advice was valued , he discovered that his vision of himself as another Colonel House , a second Harry Hopkins , a Brother Milton or Brother Bobby redivivus was not to be . He did not need the lesson twice . Although he continued to aid his favorites , he did so with an air of being far above the battle which only served to make his concealed partisanship more effective . And little by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatic influence left vacant when his great idol succumbed . " Does n't he have an ideal life ? " he had once asked a friend with naive wistfulness when Big Walter was at his peak of fame and power , worshiped by all the Right Thinkers and Forward Lookers , hailed universally as a latter-day Socrates , a modern Plato , Paragon of the Nations and Monument of the Age . " He just sits there in that study and writes his thoughts on things and the whole country listens . Is n't that a life to lead ? " And now , at last , Walter Dobius could lead it . The years of glory began . If in the process of reaching them Walter seems to have had little personal life , this is because , essentially , he has n't . Walter has been an ambitious machine for most of his days , and personal considerations have been peripheral . His parents are dead , he has two brothers and a sister whom he almost never sees ; there are three or four old friends from high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World of Walter Wonderful 49suitably awed ( he has no genuinely close friends in Washington , for all the thousands of famous and talented people he knows ) ; and he did marry Helen-Anne Carrew , when he was young in Washington , because he was temporarily bemused by her brains and by the idea that a proper columnist ought also to be a well-wed one , since so much of the capital 's news-gathering occurs on the social circuit and the contacts one acquires there . Her motivations had been much the same , with the addition of some genuine affection and the feeling that anyone so arrogant as Walter must be vulnerable and in need of protection . But it did n't work , for the reasons implicit in their conversationjust now : brains equal to his in some respects , an intuition greater ; an equal ambition ; a refusal to grant the automatic acknowledgment of superiority which is necessary to Walter if he is to feel really secure and write at his best . They had stuck it out for seven years , getting increasingly on each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them together because Walter feared it would distract him from his work ; had finally parted in a half-hateful , half-friendly way that still prompts Helen-Anne to call him sometimes , as she has tonight , to warn him against some misstepshe fears he may take , or to urge modification of some pet thesis he is promoting in his column . Of course he is never able to concede the possibility of a misstep , for his record of success indicates that he makes none ; and since he early discovered her conservative bent , her ideas on his public philosophy can be dismissed as typically reactionary , obstructive , and worthless . This relieves Walter of feeling any ties to Helen-Anne  --  except , of course , the tie she still exerts by being unimpressed . And that , of course , ties him to her forever .

The nickname , often used with a jealous mockery among his older colleagues in Washington but always echoed with a dutifully respectful friendliness in less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since . For fifteen years , now , he has occupied his unique position , challenged by three or four , ousted by none , never seriously threatened in his role as ( to quote from the preface of The Necessary Dobius , a compilation of his columns and speeches published five years ago ) " America 's philosopher-statesman par excellenceand nonpareil , " and ( to quote from the welcoming address of the Yale trustees when he was elected to join their number ) " this beacon-light of the intellect whose rays illumine the murkiest corners of American policy and bear testimony to the nations that all is not wasteland in the Great Republic of the West . " 50 Capable of HonorOne of his non-worshipping colleagues , scornfully snapping off a CBS special , " Tribute to A Mind , " on the occasion of his third Pulitzer and fiftieth birthday , had remarked , " It 's a pity Walter died so young .

Thus he goes his way , his influence so pervasive and his ideas so dominant that it can almost be said that he is the principal architect of American thought on most of the major issues of the age . This could be a farcical idea  --  as Newsweek in its hysteria may have noted with the right emphasis but for the wrong reasons  --  hut it is a factual one . He reflects with satisfaction now , as he finishes his Manhattan , gets up from the big armchair , and goes into the candlelit dining room where Arbella has graced his solitary meal with the Georgian silver service and the antique lace tablecloth that are always laid out be the number of diners one or twenty , that he and the powerful columnists , commentators , broadcasters , writers and reviewers who accord with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlling the country as anyone can . He knows  --  and it is both pleasing and flattering  --  that since the Sixties they have made it virtually impossible for anyone who disagrees with them to receive an impartial hearing in America . They have successfully scoffed and attacked and withered almost every attempt to state the opposing view . They have established such a monopoly on the means of communication that those who venture to assert an independence from them are subjected instantly and automatically to a savage campaign to smear , suppress , or ridicule down . It is no mean accomplishment , and Walter and his world are justified when they reflect , with the smugness born of a secure intellectual hegemony , that their views , and their prejudices , are quite , quite safe . If their countrymen sometimes show a certain restiveness at this , if on occasion there is some harsh indication  --  such as , say , a roar of cheers at a public meeting when someone attacks the press  --  Walter and his world are highly indignant and dismayed . Their consternationis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them to exercise the virtual censorship of American thought that they do , in fact , exercise : it is necessary to their self-esteem that they be allowed to believe that they are getting away with it . One of the few humorous  --  The World of Walter Wonderful 51if not actually pathetic  --  aspects of Walter and his world is their naive belief that nobody sees through them . It is shattering to them to realize that while the peasants may be easygoing and too lazy to object very much , they are not fooled . This is upsetting . But not , of course , upsetting enough for them to deviate in the slightest from the exercise of the dictatorship that they have managed to establish over the American mind . Right Thoughts flood the columns , dominate the airwaves , fill the editorials , news reports , movies , plays and reviews . Right Thoughts are everywhere . Right Thoughts are gospel , and Walter , as Patsy truly says , is their God . And the gospel he presides over and offers to his countrymen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first caught the approving eyes of his employers , the same arguments that he and his major colleagues have offered ever since the end of the Second World War , endlessly repeated through every means of communica-tion : America is declining in influence and therefore unable to meet her problems with firmness and integrityCommunism is gaining in strength and therefore had best be accommodated , because its advances are n't really very important anyway , and anyway , it might be dangerous to try to stop themAnd a blind fear of atomic war , offered as the final obliterating answer to all who dare suggest that if America will only stand unafraidfor the great revolutionary principles upon which she was founded , she can come safely through her perils and achieve in reasonable time the establishment of an honorable and lasting peace .

It would save everybody so much wear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his friends if I did ? " the Presidentinquired with a sudden grin . " Poor Walter would have a stroke , he 's so dead set on getting Ted in here . About as dead set , " he added , the grin deepening , " as you are to get me in here . " " But you are here , " the First Lady said comfortably . " That 's the difference . " " I really think , " he said with a smile , " that you think it 's just a picnic . Any normal wife would be worried about the wear and tear on me . She would want me to retire and take it easy . She would n't want me to continue to knock myself out in the world 's most thankless job  --  " " I know it is n't a picnic , " she said . " I 'm not a fool . It 's just that I believe in you and in what you are doing for the country .

You love it . " His smile broadened . " Some segments worship me , but I have n't noticed too many hosannasfrom Walter and his friends . They 've had to go along with the general mood , but you 've noticed all the careful qualifications in the columns , broadcasts , and editorials . ' I'lwy do n't like anybody to get really tough with the Communists . It upsets them . " " They 're worried about the bomb , " the First Lady said . He made a skeptical sound . " And I 'm not ? My God , I eat , sleep , think , and dream the bomb twenty-four hours a day . " " I know you do . You need n't swear about it . That 's the only thing I regret about this office . You use more profanity than you used to . " The President gave a delighted laugh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could reduce everything to the fundamental level you do . " " How could you ? " she inquired with her sudden little twinkle . " You 're a man . Now : why do n't you announce at your press conference this week ? " " I do n't think I 'll have one . I think I 'll lie low this week and let Walter and Ted and Orrin produce the fireworks . Anyway , as I say , I have nothing  --  absolutely nothing  --  to announce . " " You ca n't sit still , " his wife said . " History wo n't let you . " The buzzer on his phone sounded sharply in the big , cluttered room . " There 's history , now . " " No it is n't , " he said , reaching for the phone . " It 's Orrin . But I guess he 's history , too . Hello ? "  --  he nodded across the desk with a confirmingsmile  --  " yes , put him on . . . Hi . . . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on policy in that area but if you 'd like to come by and talk about it again , there 's nothing doing here tonight , as you know . We 're just having a quiet snack in the upstairs study . I do n't mind talking about problems some more , it 's all I  --  Oh , it 's you you want to talk about ? " He chuckled . " My friend , I could never have guessed . O.K. , come along . I 'll be here . Right . In fifteen minutes . . . . There , you see ? " he said , turning back to his wife . " I do n't need to move . I can sit still . History comes to me in this house . I do n't have to go after it . " " Harley Hudson , " she said , rising and preparing to depart for the family quarters , " if I had n't already bet with you , I 'd bet with you again : come next January you will be right here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after being re-elected by a landslide . It 's inevitable . " " Inevitable 's a big word . " " If anything is , " she said , concluding a conversation she would recallmany times later , " you are . " " Well , do n't tell Walter , " he said with a grin . " He could n't stand it . " She came around the desk and kissed him good night . " I 'll let you tell Walter . He only listens to people on his own level . Do n't be too late , now . " He nodded . " I 'll try not to . But it depends on the Secretary of State . " Alone in the room that held so much history , in the house where history lived , he sat for a moment after she had gone , staring out at the Monument where it rose imperious and shining into the snowsweptnight . The storm was beginning to slacken a little , the savage gusts blowing out of Virginia and the west were dying , soon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold white world would settle over Washington . It was a little late in the year for it , hopefully spring would come tomorrow , but tonight and probably for the rest of the week the capital was still in the grip of the weather , and the mood , of winter . And not a very happy mood it was or had been , he thought with an uneasy grimness , still reflecting as it did the savage stresses and strains created by his successful confrontation with the Communists at Geneva a year ago and the many problems flowing from the crisis that had arisen six months after in both the United Nations and the United States over the visit of H.R.H. Terence Wolowo Ajkaje the M'Bulu of Mbuele . When he had walked out on the Soviets at Geneva , in the most decisive action any American President of recent decades had taken with the Communists , the world had not known for some hours whether it would die or live . It had lived , but on different terms and on a different basis from those existing before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of an outright ultimatum from its most implacable opponent . When the M'Bulu , the Communists , and the more childlike and irresponsible of the Afro-Asian nations had almost succeeded in censuringand expelling the United States from the UN because of its racial problem which the M'Bulu had deliberately inflamed , the reaction within America had been violent and grave indeed . Walter Dobius and his world might argue with a suave desperation that the56 Capable of HonorUnited States was undoubtedly to blame and therefore should stay in the UN in order to keep the Afro-Asians happy and well-financed while they went about their carefree business of destroying the fragile bonds of world order , but all their millions of words had not been sufficient to stem the tide of feeling in the country . The UN , as always , had been the UN 's worst enemy ; and not all the bugaboos of possible disaster should the UN collapse , raised by Walter and his world , could conceal the organization 's built-in death-drive from a proud and impatientpeople increasingly convinced that the United States was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly unable to accept the argument that the United States must always be cheerfully willing to . Upon the President , however , there rested a higher obligation than the powerful carping of Walter 's world on the one side , a stronger imperative than the rising impatience of so many of his countrymen on the other . It was true that the UN was in sad disarray , that not all the Right Thinkers in the world could conceal the fatal irresponsibilityof its new and inexperienced members , that its sickness infected all of international relations with a cancer second only to that of Communism itself . The argument could not stop there . Weak and wavering as the United States itself had been toward the organization over the years , sadly as its leaders had allowed themselves to be persuaded on a thousand occasions that they must not act with firmness because it might offend some little power that might not like them , still there was something to be gained by keeping the UN alive , and staying in it . Or at least there was something to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside the dreams , pretensions , and fears of men , should find termination inescapable . He was not ready to write the UN off yet , however , ragtag and bobtailhodgepodge of nations and non-nations though it had become . There was still some glimmering , feeble hope of reformation , some last faint possibility that its raucously brawling members would realize at the last moment that every time they weakened it or twisted its rules to satisfy their anti-colonialist hysteria they were only weakeningthemselves and making more certain the road to their own extermination . Without the UN , most of Africa and Asia would die under the new Communist imperialism , yet every day most of Africa and Asia did everything they could to make the UN die . They were fools , the President thought impatiently , history 's greatest fools , and saying that they were still just children was no excuse . It was time , and past time , that they grew up . This was perhaps the major headache that would face the next manThe World of Walter Wonderful 57to sit at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communism itself . He had read in many a column by Walter Dobius , he had sat right here last Thursday night and heard him say it in person , that the old fears of Communism were now out of date , that a new era had dawned , that it was no longer wise or even , he gathered , fashionable , to be suspicious of the Russians , the Chinese , and all their vicious little hangers-on around the globe . He could not in all honesty see how Walter got that way . He could remember these wildly welcomed " new looks " before , these oft-recurringand quick-dying " new eras , " the trade , the visits , the desperate attempts  --  by the West , not by the Communists  --  to pretend that the basic drive had changed ; the determined and unending campaign by Walter and his world to make their countrymen believe that it was somehow stupid and unfair to continue to be suspicious of a system that was absolutely and irrevocably dedicated to the death of their country as a free nation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , and he was not impressed . These eagerly and repeatedly hailed softenings of Communism that were no softenings at all were the Potemkin villages of the Western mind , or at least that portion of it influenced by " Salubria " in Leesburg . Not one single item of hard fact in more than half a century gave corroboration , yet day in and day out , week after week , year after year , Walter and his friends reiterated their contention that Communism was changing , that it was becoming " mature and civilized , " that its practitioners were really human beings as kindly as could be and not human machines dedicated to the destruction of every decency in the world . Well , he had not fallen for that standard weakness of Presidents which had led most of his predecessors to fancy that their own personalcharm , devastating and infinite as it always was , would be sufficient to divert Communism from its irrevocable purpose . The naive belief that a personal chat could solve everything had not been his . His own confrontation had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been knocked out of his eyes at once and permanently . Thank God for that . It enabled him to read with the skepticism they deserved the suave exhortations to weakness put forth by Walter 's world . Since he could not , aside from some few examples which were known or whispered about in Washington , believe that a majority of those who peddled this line were actually traitors to their country , the President could only conclude that their arguments sprang from a terrible and pitiable fear . They were actually , apparently , so afraid of58 Capable of Ilonorthe consequences of having their country stand up for what she believed in that they would go to any lengths to persuade her to abandon it and crawl away  --  crawl away , though they professed indignantlynot to see it , straight into the darkness the Communists were readying for them . Again , it seemed to him that a sizable portion of the society he had to deal with should grow up . Ile could not afford to be patient much longer with children who played so irresponsibly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : soon , at any rate , he might be able to lay down this burden and let someone else worry about it . If , that is , he could be sure that the hands into which it passed were suitably strong and suitably equipped , by experience and belief , to carry it . And right here , he realized with a wry little smile as he looked about the private office where he had already faced so many crises and which had already become so familiar to him in the short space of a year , he was entering the realm of the Rationale of Presidents . " Let 's face it , " he said aloud with a humorous air to the silent room , " nobody can handle this job better than I. I do n't want anybody to handle this job better than I. I do n't want anybody to handle this job but me . Period . Exclamation point . And twenty-five little stars and asterisks . " That was the truth of it when you came right down to it , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so disinterested in the rationalizings of mere men . If he permitted himself to entertainthe thought just a little longer , just a very little longer , he would run again because he had convinced himself that no one else was capable and he simply had to run again . It was as simple as that . But I ca n't do it , part of his mind objected , because I gave my word . But , another part objected , your word to preserve and protect the country that you swore when you took office is more important than any word you gave anyone else . And anyway , it added , how could Orrin or Ted or anybody do the job as well as you can with all your experience ? One year 's experience , the first part said scornfully . But more than any other living soul has , the other part rejoined . Very well , then , the first part said , what do we have to face now ? We have Felix Labaiya hurrying home to Panama , which he thinks we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of knowingthings , and we do . And what does that mean ? Certainly nothing pleasant for the United States , if Felix 's past performances are any indication ... . The World of Walter Wonderful 59And we have Gorotoland , where Terrible Terry 's cousin is raisinghell aided by the Russian and Chinese Communists , and where American missionaries at the All-Faiths Hospital near the capital of Molobangwe , and the new Standard Oil installation up-country , may both be seriously threatened at any moment . And we have our formal warning , issued by me a week ago to Terry 's cousin , His Royal Highness Obifumatta Ajkaje ( " Prince Obi " in Walter 's fatherly columns and the world 's headlines ) , telling him that his trumped-up " People 's Free Republic of Gorotoland " had better stay clear of American nationals and American property  --  and we have , as a result of that , fifty wild speeches in the General Assembly , a thousand condemnatory blasts from Walter and his world , and tomorrow'sSecurity Council meeting to consider " American imperialist aggression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining the American installation on the moon which was established a year ago in the midst of the turmoilover Bob Leffingwell 's nomination to be Secretary of State . And the question of whether Clete O'Donnell and his " One Big Union , " which controls much of the work at the Cape , are going to permit a needed refueling and crew-replacement ship to go , or whether they are going to strike and hold up the government for some political purpose , which is how Clete likes to use his power ... . And the latest screaming by Indonesia at Australia in their running feud , a feud increasingly serious now that Djakarta has renewed its alliance with Peking ... . And the strong likelihood of a British election soon , which could mean new problems there ... . And such intriguing domestic mysteries as who will line up with whom , what coalitions will be formed , what concentrations of power be created or disbanded , in the shifting , whirling , clashing fandango of the coming campaign ... . And so , forever and always , inevitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of who will sit in this house . For a patient man , he told himself with a wry little smile , he certainlyseemed to be impatient about a lot of things . But then , there were a lot of things to be impatient about . The ubiquitous buzzer sounded again . Lifting the phone , he was informed that one of the principal ones was on the way up in the elevator . He frowned for a moment , but when the Secretary of State entered he found the Presidentpropped back in his chair with his hands folded comfortably upon his ample stomach , regarding him with a kindly , welcoming smile. 6o Capable of II onorThe Secretary 's reaction , as Scab Cooley had once described it in the midst of one of their many legislative battles in the Senate , was Orrinesque . " I must say that 's a happy picture , " he remarked with a certain amicable asperity . " How do you manage it ? " " By having a clear conscience and always doing right , " the Presidentresponded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people do n't think so , but I do . " " Mmmhmm , " Orrin Knox said , dropping with accustomed ease into one of the big leather armchairs , draping a leg over one arm , facinghis superior with a quizzical air , " I do n't think Walter Dobius thinks so . " " Oh , good heavens , " the President said . " Have n't we got better things to worry about tonight than Walter ? " Ile sighed in mock concern . " But no , obviously you have n't . But do n't let him get you down , Orrin . He 's just a columnist . " " Yes , " the Secretary of State said dryly . " Ile 's going to try to take your convention right away from you in that speech Friday night unless you stop him . " The President shook his head . " Oh , come . You build him up too much . That 's how he 's achieved the position he has  --  just by claiming it and persuading otherwise level-headed people to go along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that , " Orrin Knox said . " And they are persuaded . That 's the problem . " The President turned away for a moment to stare again , as Presidentsare wont to do , at the Washington Monument  --  tribute to unassailable , unknowable , indispensable George , long since passed into legend , having served his time with honor and gone to glory undiminished , freed from all those torments his successors have to face . " Yes , " he agreed thoughtfully , turning back , " that is a problem . What do you want me to do about it ? " " Make your own position clear , " the Secretary said bluntly . " Either come in or get out . " For just a second the President started to look offended and then , remembering who he was talking to , looked amused instead . " If I want straight talk and firm advice I do n't have to read Walter , do I ? I just have to have a chat with my Secretary of State . . . . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a shrewd look and let him have it . " You could resolve the whole thing once and for all . If you 're goingThe World of Walter Wonderful 61to run , I 'll stop fretting and settle for a plaque on the cornerstone of that latest **44;7508;TOOLONG that my busy planners at the State Department want us to build . If you are n't , then I 'll get moving instead of sitting around half-paralyzed waiting for you . As it is , I 'm respectful enough to sit still but my opponent is n't . As witness this business with Walter . " " You 're respectful , all right , " the President said with a chuckle , " but only because you 're not sure of what I would do if you barged ahead without my permission . Right ? " The Secretary of State gave him a cheerful grin . " Oh , that 's part of it . But not all  --  not all . Really , Harl  --  Mr. President  --  whydo you do this to us ? Do you like to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , I do n't like to see you squirm . At this moment , I honestly do not know what to do . " " Well , if you do n't know , " Orrin said , " then that means you 're going to run . You did n't have any doubts a year ago . Now you have doubts . Having doubts , you will resolve them in your favor . Presidents usually do , when the Constitution gives them a chance . Good Lord , you 've only served a year in this office . You 're permitted to stay another eight . Who would want to give it up ? " The President smiled . " There speaks a man who has never had it . The imagination runs rampant when it comes to this job . The power  --  the glory "  --  he began in a grandiloquent tone which changed to one of wry irony as he went along  --  " the problems  --  the headaches  --  " " The chance to do what you want to do for the country , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are at getting your countrymen to go along with it and with you having the satisfaction when it works out , " the Secretary finished for him . " Yes , it 's a burden , all right . And you all get to love it in spite of its problems . Let 's face it , " he suggested with a grin . " Power corrupts  --  and absolute power is absolutely delightful . " The President laughed in spite of himself . " Not so absolute . Our friends on the Hill do n't allow it to be absolute . The Supreme Court does n't allow it to be absolute . The country does n't allow it to be absolute . Walter , " he said with a wry expression , " does n't allow it to be absolute . A thousand and one things do n't allow it to be absolute . " " Absolute enough to satisfy any sane ego for as long as life remains . " " All right , " the President said , leaning forward and leaning his el-62 Capable of Honorbows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin upon them , staring straight at the volatile , impatient , powerful old friend who sat across from him . " Let me tell you how absolute it is . You know how absolute you are in your own department , where any little clerk with the wrong slant on things can throw you off with a carefully phrased position paper . Let me tell you how it is here . " You see this fancy phone and these fancy gadgets  --  that all add up to that button ' everybody 's worried about for so many years ? What do I have to go on , if I should decide to press it ? Well , I have an estimate by you and the Secretary of Defense , let 's say , on what a given situationactually is . And on what do you base your assessment of its political realities , and he his assessment of its military aspects ? In each case , on somebody lower down , who gives you what he receives  --  from somebody lower down . And underneath that , there 's  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there we are , back at your little clerk , who may or may not be loyal and reliable . " He frowned . " Who can possibly have all the facts in a world as complex as this ? Our society believes that the President has , because for the sake of its own sanity it has to believe it . But I do n't know  --  no mortal man can know , of his own knowledge  --  all the facts on which a President acts . The thing is too big . I ca n't tell you  --  of my own knowledge  --  that if I push that button , so many ICBM 's will blast off for Russia or China or Indonesia . All I know is that somebody below has told me so  --  and somebody in turn has told him  --  and he in turn has gotten it from somebody else . I have n't gone to see for myself , I could n't possibly . I act in the faith that I have been given a true account . The country follows me because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What single individual could ? " For a long moment there was a silence in the historic room in the quiet old house that served as the focus for so many hopes and fears in so many strange and varied lands . The Secretary of State spoke very softly when he finally spoke . " It 's terrifying , is n't it ? " " Yes , " the President said grimly , " it is terrifying . Are you big enough to face it ? That 's what I have to know , before I can do anything about this election . " The Secretary of State made an impatient gesture . " Is he ? " " Do n't talk about him , " the President said sternly . " I 'll get to him . Are you ? " The World of Walter Wonderful 63Again there was a silence . The President was aware as he searched the strong and determined face before him that the last sounds of wind had gone , the storm was over . He and his Secretary of State seemed adrift in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course in their companionate responsibilities they were in reference to everyone and everything that lived and existed on the globe . The President could see that the face before him was thoughtful , but he was not surprised that it was not afraid . " I think I am big enough , " Orrin said slowly . He too stared with a distant contemplation at the Monument . " Of course  --  who can say for sure , until he 's tested ? Could you have said so a year ago when you came down here from the Senate that afternoon to take the oath ? Certainly "  --  and he smiled a little at the thought of that now far-off , frightening moment for them all  --  " certainly not too many of us on the Hill thought you could . Could you have said when you went to Geneva ? Again , few of us were sure . But you did , did n't you , Harley ? You could . The time came , the demand was rendered  --  and you could . So , I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly into the honest eyes across from him , eyes that held now a much greater wisdom , certitude , courage , and sadness than they had a year ago . " Do you doubt it ? " Again there was a silence as the President returned his look with a thoughtful stillness that came from many things he had learned and experienced about men and their characters and dreams in the past twelve months . " I do n't doubt your courage , Orrin , " be said finally . " The public recordis full of that for the past twenty years . It goes deeper than courage . It goes to  --  acceptance , I think you might call it  --  of what this job is , and what it does to you , and what it can do to the country and to all of humankind . You can talk about it . But can you do it ? " " How can anyone do it except you , " the Secretary demanded with a sudden exasperation , " if you wo n't get out of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't kick you out , you know . You 're here ' til you want to leave , that 's for sure . " The President started to laugh and then stopped abruptly , with a curious note of unhappiness and questioning and , in some strange way , almost of self-distaste , in his voice . " I do n't know whether I want to stay or leave , Orrin , " he said quietly , " and that 's the God 's truth . " The Secretary shrugged , though it cost him much to do it . " You want to stay , " he said in a voice he succeeded in making indifferent . " So stay . " 64 Capable of HonorAgain the President uttered a curious half-humorous , half-skeptical , regretful sound . " It is n't that easy , and you know it . " " I ca n't help you , " Orrin said . " But , " he added quietly , " you can help me . If you so decide . " The President sighed . " Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  more time , Orrin . I have n't quite got the feel of this yet , I need some sign . I do n't know what 's going to happen in Africa , or in Panama , or Southeast Asia . I do n't know what 's going to happen  --  " " You 're looking for justifications , " the Secretary interrupted , aware that he might be running the risk of antagonizing I Earley , but feeling also that the conversation had reached an impasse , there was no hope of resolving anything tonight even if time was rushing forward and Walter Dobius and his world were about to send the Jason bandwagon racing down the road . " Something is always happening somewhere that we ca n't see the end of . Time has no stops these days . There are no clarifications in the world , only new confusions to displace the old and so give us some illusion that we are moving ahead instead of churning around , as we very probably arc , in an ever-narrowing circle . You can wait forever , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead and run , Mr. President . I 'll support you in every way I can and serve you in any capacity you want afterward . Surely you have no doubts on that score . " The President shook his head . " Oh no , of course not . And of course I 'd want you to stay right where you are . If , that is  --  " His voice trailed away and he looked down at the many papers on his desk in an odd way as though he had never seen them before . " Well , " Orrin said with a sudden decision , starting to rise , " I 'm sorry I took your time . I guess we 'll just have to ride out whatever Walter says Friday night and play the whole thing by car . " " I 'd talk to him , if I were you , " the President suggested . The Secretarypaused . " That 's what Beth says , " he admitted . " I do n't think it would hurt you . And it might slow him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't got your support , " Orrin said , trying not to make his emphasis too annoyed . " Do n't forget that I can help  --  or hinder  --  Ted , too . If he 's wise , he wo n't encourage Walter to go too far . " " If I know Ted , " Orrin said tartly , " he 's playing on Walter 's ego andThe World of Walter Wonderful 65hoping he 'll go as far as possible . There 's one risk you run , you know , Mr. President . You may be underestimating Ted . He may not be as inhibited about waiting for you as I am . " " Well , " the President said with an equal bluntness , " I 'd like to see him try to run if the President decides to ! It would be the end of him politically . " " That did n't stop him in New Hampshire , " Orrin could n't resist pointingout . The President , for him , looked quite pugnacious . " And he got soundly licked , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . " I still would n't put it past him to try . . . . Tell me , " he said , changing the subject as he saw the thought beginning to sink into the President 's mind , easygoing and good-natured on most things but , like all Presidents ' minds , touchy and self-defensive when it came to the protection of his own position , " are there any last-minute instructions you want me to give Cullee and Lafe at the UN before tomorrow 's Security Council session ? I 'm planning to call them around nine tonightat the Waldorf . They 're attending a party Selena Jason Castleberry'sgiving for Prince Obifumatta and the People 's Free Republic of Gorotoland . " " Oh , dear , " the President said with a relieved , humorous expression , diverted from perhaps being forced into a political decision that might cause hurt to someone if it arrived too soon , " oh , my ! So Selena 's stepping in , is she ? If it is n't the Jasons we have to worry about , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Selena 's doing her bit , " Orrin said . " I understand half the UN and half of New York are there . " " Except His Royal Highness Prince Terry the M'Bulu of Mbuele , " the President said with a grim little smile . " Terry is finding out what it means to be the darling of a certain segment of America , " the Secretary said . " It means you 're a darling today and damned tomorrow . " " It could n't happen to a more deserving fellow , " the President said , remembering the high and mighty way Terry had acted on his visit six months ago which had stirred up so much trouble , and recalling also the talk he and Orrin had held with him in this very room , in the midst of it . " But , " he added as other implications came to mind , " still not a pleasant matter for us . " " No , indeed , " the Secretary said . " He is the legitimate government , and we ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . " 66 Capable of Honor " Give Cullee and Lafe my best , " the President said . " They know what I have in mind , if necessary . " " They know , " Orrin said thoughtfully . " It would be a sensation , right enough . And not on a very major issue . But  --  " he shrugged . " It 's all major . There are n't any minor issues these days . The world turns on every one , for all we know , so we have to proceed on that basis , since the Communists force us to . " He sighed . " I 'll call you if the boys have anything startlingly new to report . " " I doubt if they will . Personally , I 'm going to bed early . I 'd suggest you do the same . " " I 'll try , " Orrin said . He was unable to resist a parting shot . " I hope you have a good talk with Ted , whenever it happens , and manage to impress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office . " " I look forward to it , " the President said with what , for him , was a surprisingly mischievous little smile . " I may not make you squirm , Orrin , but I think it would be rather fun with Ted . " " Yes , " the Secretary said dryly . " If what you 've just done was not make me squirm , then I really feel sorry for Ted . And causing me to feel that , I might add , is quite an achievement . " The President laughed . " My love to Beth . " " Always , " the Secretary said . It was with an odd mixture of amusement , anger , frustration , and hopelessness that Orrin sat back against the cushions as the driver of his official department limousine guided it slowly over the hushed and slippery streets toward Spring Valley . Very few cars were out , there was only the occasional sound of chains slapping against fenders or the soft susurrus of snow tires creeping cautiously by in the ghostly avenues to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of those curiously deserted and exposed moments in Washington when the past for some reason seems very close , when the figures of complicatedTom Jefferson in his study , or Andy Jackson on a horse , or Abe Lincoln stalking thoughtfully along with his cape pulled tight against the cold , come easily to mind ; in which it seems that anything  --  or everything  --  might happen . Or nothing , the Secretary of State told himself wryly . Apparently , as far as the President was concerned , nothing . It had been a good many months since he had seen Harley Hudson so irresolute . This was almost the old Harley , the one who had been a timorous and worried Vice President until the sudden death of his vigorous predecessor had plunged him abruptly into the center of the world 's events . After that , The World of Walter Wonderful 67Harley had not been irresolute  --  until now . The irresolution was understandableenough to other men of power . The President had power and he did n't want to give it up : felt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could not ; knew , actually , that it was entirely up to him and that no one could force him one way or the other ; and so was caught on the points of conscience and duty and dilemma in a way that probably made it quite literally impossible for him at this moment to do anything . He had said he wanted a sign , Orrin rememberedwryly , while the car skidded slightly at z3rd and MassachusettsAvenue as it swung around Sheridan Circle , and then steadied itself and crept carefully up Embassy Row . Well , Orrin had tried to give him one  --  it could n't have been any clearer if he had walked up and down Pennsylvania Avenue outside the White House gates carrying a sign that said FOR GOD 'S SAKE GIVE SOMEBODYELSE A CHANCE . But the President , he knew , had to move in his own good time , though every day , seemingly , made it more difficult for him to move in the direction Orrin and Ted Jason wanted him to . Actually there was every evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name to go into the New Hampshire primary and had soundly trounced both Orrin and Ted , each of whom had maintained that their backers had acted without their permission . Of course the President had maintained the same thing , and undoubtedlyeach of the three had been convinced that his own desire to remain aloof had been quite genuine . Nonetheless , there they all were in the contest , and the President had won by a landslide . Then he had again permitted his name to go into the Wisconsin primary  --  this time , by dint of vehement insistence and threats of all sorts of dire reprisals against their overeager lieutenants , both Orrin and Ted had managed to stay out and give him a clear field  --  and again he had won by a landslide . Meanwhile at his press conferences he had played a game of halfanswerand jocular sidestep worthy of his predecessor at his peak . Nobody had pinned him down yet , though many skilled people had tried . And always , for the record , he had firmly and without equivocationreiterated the statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succession a year ago : he would not be a candidate for re-election . With this combination of noble purpose on the one hand and political flirtation on the other , he had successfully kept the matter in his own hands , and had , as Orrin told him , paralyzed the two potential contenderswho were so anxious to succeed him . The Secretary of State , who was certainly not one to be let alone by Walter Dobius and his68 Capable of Honorworld in such a personally embarrassing situation , found himself sub- jected to a constant barrage of questioning whenever he exposed him- self to the press , be it at formal press conference or in one of those hur- ried running interrogatories that always accompany the arrival and departure of a Secretary of State before the committees of the Con- congress . This was an old game , and both he and his questioners played it with a certain humor ; but the constant necessity to deny his own am- bitions and maintain with a straight face that he saw no evidence of the President 's would sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in little mood for jovial chitchat . This put an extra burden on Beth , but fortunately her long experience as an old campaigner 's wife usually came to the rescue in time . The more he thought about it now , as the limousine crossed Wis- cousin Avenue , passed Ward Circle , and made the final run into Spring Valley , the less patient and less tolerant he felt about the President . Harley was obviously about to be confronted by a major demarche on the part of the Jasons in this speech by Walter Dobius , a dramatic rallying behind Ted of all the psychological and actual forces Walter could command . The President could still act , but apparently he was unable to see that his area of action would inevitably be re- stricted to some degree as soon as all of Walter 's friends and sup- porters came out on Saturday with their columns and editorials , their news reports and their special television and radio playbacks that would , the Secretary knew , flood the country over the weekend . A massive barrage of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed in the wake of Walter 's speech . The longer the President waited the more difficult it would be for him to escape its oppressive and hampering confines . As for his own position , the Secretary decided as the car drew up at his door and he bade the driver good night with wishes for a safe journey back downtown , it inevitably would have to be just what he had told Beth earlier in the day . He would have to announce his own candidacy , whether the President liked it or not , and he would have to plunge immediately into his campaign . He had a reasonably good organization in most of the states , party leaders who had supported him twice before in his unsuccessful tries for the nomination and had given active indication they would again . He had a modest amount of money and a few substantially moneyed backers . He had his name and his record . He had Beth . He had himself . He was not afraid of the future , but as he stamped the snow from his boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall closet and went along to theThe World of Walter Wonderful 69comfortable living room where he knew she would be reading in front of the fire , he could have wished that it were arriving a little more on his terms . " Well , " she said , closing the book ( New Myths and Old Realities , by one of Walter 's more outspoken competitors in the great seesaw ofAmerican opinion ) - and looking up with a smile , " how did it go ? " " He wants to run , but he wants someone to tell him to . " " And did you ? " The Secretary made a quizzical sound . " I certainly did . " " And is he ? " He shook his head in an impatient way . " Oh , of course not . It will have to be done over and over , and all the while he 'll be inching closer and closer . Suddenly one day he 'll find himself in it . " He frowned . " Meanwhile , Walter will have made his speech and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will all end up in a very embarrassing tangle . But that 's what happens when you have conscience in the White House . The White House always wins , but conscience has to have its day . " " I 'm sure he has other motives than just ego , " Beth said , and the Secretary nodded quickly . " Oh , certainly . I 'm not denying Harley 's integrity or good heart . But  --  it puts me on the spot , right enough . " " All right , then , " she said briskly , " when do we hit the road ? " He gave her a humorously grateful smile and immediately looked more relaxed . " Hank , " he said , " I think you 're more bloodthirsty about this than I am . When do you want to hit the road ? " " It would be a little premature before Walter 's speech , would n't it ? He called , by the way . He wants you to call him . " " Oh ? " Orrin Knox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where is he , Leesburg ? " " Out there in the snow , " Beth said with a smile , " spinning his little webs . Probably just putting the finishing touches on his speech for Ted . Why do n't you interrupt him ? " " Oh , I will , " her husband said . " I will . I just wonder what prompts this sudden contact , that 's all . " " Go find out , " she suggested . " He wo n't bite . " He chuckled . " Maybe I 'll bite him . " She smiled . " I 'm sure . But try to find out what 's on his mind , at least . " 70 Capable of HonorFor the first few moments of their conversation , however , this remained a mystery to the Secretary . For his part , Walter Dobius was not in any hurry to enlighten . An intriguing thought had hit him in the midst of his writing , he had taken up the telephone and acted upon it at once . Beth Knox had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sound particularly pleased , though he knew she must be at this show of interest from one whom the Knoxes , he was sure , regarded as an enemy . It pleased him to play the part of unsuspected friend now , particularly in the cause of so shrewd a jest . He had not believed Beth when she said the Secretary was out . He could imagine their fear of him , their puzzled concern , their worried discussion , their pleased conclusion that he must be leaning toward Orrin and so , finally , the Secretary 's decision to call back . It all lent an extra edge of confidence to his voice , the unctuously kindly and patronizing note that was , though he did not know it , among his most infuriating characteristics to those who were not quite as overawed by Walter Wonderful as Walter Wonderful sometimes supposed . At first , however , the Secretary managed to conceal this . His own tone was politely interested and quite correct . " It 's always good to hear from you , Walter . How 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " About six or seven inches , I 'd say . I 'll have a devil of a time getting in to catch my plane to New York tomorrow . " " Oh , are you going ? " " Yes . I was planning to go up to the UN to see Prince Terry and his cousin  --  " " Not together , I hope , " Orrin interrupted . Walter uttered a cordial , knowing little laugh . " Hardly . Also , Vasily Tashikov called and invited me to lunch , and so all in all  --  I really hope I can get up there . It should be very in-teresting . " " Yes , I suppose , " the Secretary said , thinking , I 'll be damned if I 'll invite you to fly up with me , no matter how you hint . " Are you going to cover the debate in the Security Council , too ? " " What 's going to happen in that debate , Orrin ? Is there anything I should be looking for ? " Aware that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert , the Secretary deliberately made his voice as noncommittal as possible . " The usual thing , I suppose . A lot of words  --  some more mud-slinging at us  --  a postponement without a vote  --  a gradual frittering away later in the General Assembly . " The World of Walter Wonderful 71 " Is that what you expect ? " Walter asked in some surprise . " I 've been hearing over in your department that there may be something much more dramatic than that in the wind . " " Drama 's relative , " Orrin said , sounding as bored as possible . " But I imagine your talks with Terry and his cousin , and your lunch with Tashikov , will more than compensate for any official dullness . You seem to be rather partial to Terry 's cousin these days , I notice . " " I regard Prince Obi as a remarkable young man , " Walter Dobius said . " So are they both . " " Yes , but Prince Obi , I think , rather more than Prince Terry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uprising behind him . " " Oh , Walter , stop being ridiculous , " the Secretary said , provoked to annoyance despite his plans by this dutiful parroting of the line Walter himself had done so much to create in his columns and speeches . " You know that little freebooter has nothing behind him but Soviet and Chinese Communist money . He 's depending on mercenaries , Walter . I thought you established the principle in the Congo that nobody should like mercenaries . " " I fail to see that the situations have anything in common , " Walter said stiffly . Orrin snorted . " You do n't ? Well , look hard . The resemblances are there . " " Are they ? " Walter demanded . " A vigorous and democratic young leader  --  an oppressed people  --  a spontaneous rebellion breaking out against centuries of oligarchical rule  --  " " You said exactly the same thing six months ago about Terry . Now , did n't you ? " " I thought at that time he deserved them , " Walter Dobius said sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Secretary grunted . " Walter , have you ever been to Africa ? " " I was invited to speak a year ago to the Conference of Unaligned Nations in Accra , as you know perfectly well . " " Yes , I remember , " the Secretary said . " You gave the United States quite a kicking around , as I recall . They were very pleased . Tell me , do you ever have a good word to say for your own country ? " " Now , that is n't fair , " Walter said , a real anger in his voice . " That simply is n't fair . You know perfectly well that I  --  " The Secretary gave an impatient sigh . " I know , I know . It was n't fair , and I apologize . We seem to be arguing again . What did you want to talk to me about ?

" Darling , " cried the gaunt , diamond-drenched woman with the hacked-off gray hair and the gasping eyes  --  Mrs. Jason Castleberry that was , Mrs. Roger Castelberry that had been , Selena Jason that was , had been , and always would be  --  " I do want you to come over here and meet Prince Obifumatta Ajkaje . He 's a mad , mad character and so utterly delightful in his understanding of this whole mad situation in Africa . " She glanced quickly around the hectic , shouting , bulging living room of her modest little twenty-room hideaway on Sutton Place and lowered her voice to a hurried whisper . " Not at all like our Negroes , you know . In spite of the great danger he 's in personally because of this wonderful enterprise he 's leading , bringing freedom to his poor downtrodden people in Gorotoland , he has a sense of humor about it all , you know .

His Royal Highness Prince Obi  --  Prince Obifumatta , that is . Darling , where ever did you get such a delightful name ? " The tall young Negro who loomed above her in his gorgeous red and green robes smiled down with a beneficent gaze reminiscent of his cousin , Prince Terry , except that underlying Prince Obi 's smile there was , at present , a terrible tension that grinned like the smile of death through his outward cordiality . Neither his hostess nor her guests , most of them filled to slopover with liquor , love , and liberalism , seemed to notice this , though it did not escape the two Americans , one white and one black , who stood together at the side of the rockingroom . Cullee Hamilton , Representative in Congress from the State of California , and Lafe Smith , junior Senator from the State of Iowa , members of the U.S. delegation to the UN , were under no more delusions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cousin . Only the emphasis had changed , as though a kaleidoscope had been given half a turn and everything had come up at right angles to where it used to be . It still meant trouble for them and their country . " My name ? " Prince Obifumatta repeated in the clipped , guttural Afro-British accent of his education and upbringing . " I made it up . I knew that someday I would be a famous man and I wanted a name that people could neither pronounce nor forget . So I chose Obifumatta . The World of Walter Wonderful 75Actually , " he said , giving again the nervous thrust of his savage smile , " it 's been in my family for seven hundred years , give or take a few . " " That 's what I mean , darling , " Selena Castleberry said , giving the arm of the Nation 's earnest little man an excited squeeze . " Such a sense of humor . Such a doll . " " What is your reaction to this American attempt to suppress your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Highness ? " the Nation 's little man inquired earnestly . Prince Obifumatta thumped him so fiercely on the back that he staggered . " Call me Obi ! " he directed . " Everybody does . I really have no comment at all , you know I am happy with everyone . I am not annoyed with anyone . Life is wonderful , do you not agree ? " " I do , " the Nation 's little man assured him hastily , " but I was just wondering if you cared to express a comment  --  " " Now , express a comment , Obi , dear , " Selena admonished him with a shriek of laughter . " That 's exactly why I 'm giving this **45;7554;TOOLONG party you know , so that all these darling people of the press , television , and radio , all these molders of American opinion , can see you and find out what you think .

" I 've about forgotten , " Cullee Hamilton said . He sniffed . " Guess it is  --  or about as close as New York gets when it is n't breathing the kind they were breathing in there . What a crew !

" Tear down your own country and its aims , ideals , and purposes as often and loudly as you can . Support any international brigand who attacks it and attempts to defeat it in world affairs . Tell yourself you do these things out of an enlightened liberalism and a genuine patriotism .

You know who you 'll back for President when the time comes  --  if , " he interjecteddryly , " Harley ever lets it come  --  and that automatically solves the Senate problem . I do n't think you 'll have any trouble buckingthe Jasons . The rest of the family 's like Selena , in varying degrees : they all telegraph their punches .

" " He just wanted to alert you to what was being planned so you could be thinking  --  his way . And you are , so he achieved his purpose , right ? " " I guess time will tell , " Cullee said lightly . Their car crept into Lexington Avenue and turned south . " How are you making out these days with all your romantic projects ?

" " Yes , I know , " Cullee Hamilton said softly , his own expression saddenedby the reference to the late Senator from West Virginia , former chief American delegate to the UN , whose death from leukemia six months ago had been one of the major tragedies of the last session . " How is his son these days ? " " Healthy , " Senator Smith said , with a certain bitterness in his voice in spite of himself as he thought of the smiling , handsome youth sitting serenely in his closed-off world . " Always healthy . But no improvement at all "  --  he tapped his forehead  --  " up here . However , " he added firmly , " I am determined to bring that boy back if it is humanly possible to do so , and I will . He 's in a sanitarium up the Hudson , you know .

" " Maybe Hal accomplished something with his dying , " Cullee suggestedgently . Lafe nodded . " Hal accomplished a lot of things with his dying . Whether they know it in the UN or not .

The handsome black face beside him looked genuinely troubled for a moment , the big ex-track star 's frame moved uneasily . " I am damned , " Cullee Hamilton said heavily , " if I know , at this point . You see , of all the things that are going to get caught in the squeeze between Orrin Knox and Ted Jason , little Congressman Hamilton from California is one of the most obvious .

I 've got responsibilities now , you know . " His normally open and sunny face darkened for a moment . " Hal Fry left me some . " " Yes , I know , " Cullee Hamilton said softly , his own expression saddenedby the reference to the late Senator from West Virginia , former chief American delegate to the UN , whose death from leukemia six months ago had been one of the major tragedies of the last session .

" " Seems to me you 're getting awfully personal all of a sudden , " his companion said with a frown and a note of genuine annoyance in his voice . But on the strength of a good and genuine friendship , Lafe refused to be impressed . " You know me , " he said with his engaging , boyish grin . " What fun is a world without gossip ? I 'm getting a divorce , for what it 's worth as an example to you . " " Yes , but you do n't love her , " Cullee said , his voice so low Lafe could hardly hear it . " God help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be better off , " Lafe said , though he knew he was risking a real explosion if he kept it up . " You know it .

" Ah , damn itl " " Where is she ? " Lafe asked in a matter-of-fact tone . " Did she decide to go to work for LeGage Shelby in DEFY ? " " Yes , she 's jazzing around with that no-good , loudmouth sonny-boy I used to call a friend , " Congressman Hamilton said , a frown deepeningon his handsome face at the thought of his clever , **26;7601;TOOLONG and the Defenders of Equality for You that he had put together from the more irresponsible elements of the younger Negro community .

" " If she 's running with DEFY , you 'd be better off getting one .

" " Walter Dobius says DEFY is a sterling symbol of the noblest aspirationsof the younger elements of the Negro race , constructive in purpose , democratic in procedure , forward-looking in thought , and profoundly a part of the American dream , " Senator Smith informed him solemnly . " Do n't you agree ? " Congressman Hamilton snorted . " What Walter Dobius does n't know about the Negro race and its aspirations would fill even more books than he 's written . And be about equally intelligent , in my opinion . " " That 's heresy . In the first degree . Walter thinks he 's going to make the whole world hop Friday night when he makes that speech for Ted . " " Wo n't make me hop , " Cullee said bluntly . " He never has and never will . I got Walter 's number about ten days after I arrived on the Hill .

" " Walter pretty well tells everybody how to do everything , " Lafe said thoughtfully . " Of all the sad cases of ego gigantea Washingtonia I know , I think he 's about the worst . The annoying thing about it is that he can write  --  and he 's a terrific reporter  --  and he really does do a conscientious job , according to his lights . It is n't easy to dismiss him out of hand . He 's too damned good . " " He and his pals can swing maybe five hundred thousand votes in California , " Congressman Hamilton said matter-of-factly . " That 's enough to be decisive . " " But you are n't going to let that influence you , " Lafe suggested with a humorous certainty . " I 'm not going to let that influence me . . . . What do you think of this business tomorrow in Security Council ? " The Senator from Iowa looked grave . " I think Walter and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honorif it happens . I think it may very well be a decisive factor in the presidential election . I think it may beat Orrin , if he runs , and it may even beat the President , if he runs . Certainly it will if Walter and his world have anything to say about it . And we know they will . " " You really think it 's as bad as that , " Culler said thoughtfully . " Maybe you 're right . " Lafe stared grimly out at the driving snow as though all the world 's devils were in it , while the car crept slowly down toward the Waldorf . " Just look at the consequences that can flow from it , " he said finally . " War could come from this , buddy . Do n't make any mistake about it . " Cullee gave him a quizzical look . " It would n't if Harley would back down . " " I have the feeling Harley thinks we 've backed down long enough . What do you think ?

And Iowa , I 'm very much afraid , is going to be inclined to agree with Walter Dobius  --  for different reasons , but with the same result for me . But "  --  he gave his charming grin  --  " I have a trick or two up my sleeve . Uncle Lafe is n't beaten yet , by a long shot . I 've talked Iowa around before , when the right 's been on my side . And I will this time , although "  --  his expression became somber  --  " it wo n't be so easy .

Want a nightcap before we turn in ? " Cullee nodded . " Sure . . . . Oh , oh ! " he added with a sudden humorous note as the warmth of the lobby enveloped them and he saw seated across the room a giant ebony figure , looking , though it was obviously trying not to , dejected and forlorn for all its gorgeous robes and haughty air . " Do you see who I see ? " Lafe chuckled . " I do . Shall we spread a little cheer by inviting him to join us ? " " He sure needs it , " Cullee Hamilton said , not without a certain relish . " Boy , does he ever . However , if you do n't mind  --  " " O.K. , " Lafe agreed . " We 've had our fill of him , after all . . . . Tell me , " he said as they walked on by , not looking at Terry , carefullyThe World of Walter Wonderful 85ignoring his sudden recognition , his eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he realized they did not want to see him , " did you ever meet Mabel Anderson  --  Brigham Anderson 's wife ? " " No , I have n't , " Cullee said as they entered the bar . Something in his companion 's expression caused him to smile . " Oh , that 's it , is it ? " " No , " Lafe said thoughtfully . " Not necessarily . I got a letter from her today , though . First I 've heard from her since she left Washington after his death . . . . She 's a nice girl , " he added , as if to himself . Then he grinned . " I know what you 're thinking  --  too nice for Lover Lafe . But maybe Lover Lafe is ready to settle down . Who knows ? " " Write her back , by all means , " Cullee suggested with a smile . " At once . " " I already have , " Senator Smith admitted , with an obvious satisfaction that made his friend laugh . " We 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 'll you have ? " " Something for that , " Lafe said , " and also something to wish luck to our friend in the lobby . He needs it . " And , indeed , it was clear to any perceptive observer that His Royal Highness Terence Wolowo Ajkaje , 137th M'Bulu of Mbuele , ruler  --  as long as he could hang on  --  of turbulent Gorotoland , outstanding young leader  --  at least he had been , until just recently  --  of emerging Africa , did , indubitably , need all the cheer he could get . Life was doing puzzling and unhappy things to the 137th M'Bulu , and he still was in something of a daze about it . His was a sad case . " Yesterday 's hero "  --  as the London Daily Mail had put it to the Daily Telegraph only this morning in the Delegates ' Lounge  --  " today 's bum . " It was a strange and unsettling experience for one possessed , but a few short weeks ago , of the unrestrained plaudits and unstinting assistance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad , who now turned upon him stony and unfriendly faces as they went happily about the business of helping his cousinly rival hurl him from his throne . And all for no logical reason that he could see  --  except that his cousin , the hated Obifumatta , had managed to capture both the support of the Communists and the attention of all those legendmakersand seekers after truth  --  the right kind of truth , of course , and the proper kind of legend  --  who had so recently favored Terry himself with their fond and encouraging regard . It was all very peculiar . Six months ago Terence Ajkaje  --  " Terrrible Terry " to the jet-set and the world 's headlines  --  had descended upon the United States and the United Nations like an avenging black angel86 Capable of Honorriding down a path of light to blast away the enemies of progress . ( That was the way he had actually been portrayed , in fact , in a cartoon in the Washington Post . Alas , the contrast today ! Now he appeared in the Post 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street across from the UN building , emitting from his mouth such fictitious and unfair comments as , " That ship ca n't desert us sinking rats ! " Sic transit gloria mundi , at least on some people 's editorial pages , and all in the sad short space of six little months . ) Half a year only separated him from his days of triumph . Those were the glorious days in which he had literally captured the attention of the world when he escorted a little colored girl to school in South Carolina and was stoned and egged for his deed . Those were the great days when , aided by the Communist bloc , most of his fellow Africans and Asians , and such enemies of the United States as Panama 's Ambassador Felix Labaiya-Sofra , he had roused the brawling United Nations to frenzy and come within a single vote of winning censure of the United States for its racial policies . Those were the times of triumph when Terrible Terry was on the cover of Time , Life , Look , Newsweek , the Saturday Evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times vied with the New York Post , the New York World Journal Tribune , and even the Christian Science Monitor in heaping praises on his head ; when the English language  --  except for a few sourly skeptical editorials in the place where the English language began  --  hardly held enough glowing words to do him tribute . And then  --  suddenly  --  disaster . Collapse . Bursting bubbles . Popped balloons . A pained reaction every time he heard , " The Party 's Over " on the radio . Calumny . Criticism . Slander . Libel . Denunciation . The End . Or almost The End . The End if it had n't been for the powers he had done so much to harass six months ago ; The End without the United States and Great Britain . And why ? What had he done , except be the dutiful agent of all the enemies , both foreign and domestic , of those two peculiar countries ? Had n't he appeared on all the right television programs , addressed all the right forums , attended all the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a party given by Selena Jason Castleberry " In Aid of Independent Gorotoland " ) , produced all the right answers to all the right questions put to him by all the right interviewers ? He had denounced " imperialist aggression " as self-righteously as anyone , his caustic strictures on " neo-colonialist adventurism " had rung out with the best , no one had done more than he to thwart , besmirch , and demean the United States and the United Kingdom . The World of Walter Wonderful 87Walter Dobius had written a total of ten columns supporting him , Walter 's friends and colleagues in both countries had given him the full treatment to speed success for his cause and disaster for their own governments . And now it was all gone . Where , and how , and why ? The process had begun , he could see now , with the weird little riot that had occurred in his capital city of Molobangwe just on the eve of his most triumphant moments at the UN . When Terry had left dusty Molobangwe to come to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States on racial matters , he had appointed his mother , aging but still shrewd and ruthless , to serve as co-regent with his cousin Obifumatta . Prince Obi , scion of one of the royal family 's many cadet branches , had sworn blood oaths and fealty ten times over , and although Terry realized that he possessedan intelligence and ambition almost as great as his own , he had decided to take the chance of leaving him in command . He had been confident at the time that the Council of Elders who advised the throne would take stern and immediate action if Obifumatta attemptedanything disloyal . He was also certain that if the Council failed in such a crisis , his mother would poison Obi at once . He thereforeleft home feeling quite serene . He had made just one little mistake : although he had secretly accepted Soviet and Chinese Communistaid , like many another ambitious African adventurer he had been sufficiently egotistical to think that he could somehow escape being presented with the bill for it . The riot in Molobangwe had been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been an odd little affair which had swept through the mud-and-wattle town like a vagrant wind one stifling afternoon . It was over in half a day , but not before Terry had turned in desperation to the British , who as always were ironically ready to help those who were in process of booting them out ; and not before Obifumatta had seized the opportunity to harangue the crowd , swing it to his side , and emerge as the popular hero . The Council of Elders had not dared act against him then , nor had Terry 's mother , even though it was apparentthat much more than an afternoon 's rioting and fun had been involved . The episode had been a warning to Terry , and when he arrived home from the UN  --  after a pleasant plane ride that he had shared with Senator Bob Munson of Michigan , the Senate Majority Leader , and his wife Dolly , on their way to a month in Britain and the Continent  --  the warning was spelled out in language so blunt as to temporarily shock and paralyze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-four hours88 Capable of Honorbefore had been working with him in absolute singleness of purpose at the UN , were working for different purposes six thousand miles away in Africa . He was not the first African to make this sad discovery , but it struck him with the same dismay , both laughable and pathetic , with which it strikes others in the naive continent as they harshly , inexorably , inevitably find it out . The Soviet and Chinese attaches , his smiling friends when he left Molobangwe for New York , greeted him with different faces when he got back . There was a short , ugly conference in the ramshackle old palace that once had housed some of the Christian missionaries who had attempted , without much success , to bring their own brand of progress to Gorotoland . The present-day missionaries were tougher and more to the point . Terry was told that he must form at once a " coalitiongovernment " in which Obifumatta would have equal rank and in which Communist-trained officials ( " progressive elements , " they were called by the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and foreign policy ministries of Gorotoland 's embryonic government . At first Terry refused point-blank to accede to these demands . He was reminded sarcastically that the United States and Britain were far away and not really , despite Britain 's dutiful gesture , very interested , whereas Communist forces were right here and very actively interested . In the final compromise  --  which all parties , though they hailed it dutifully , knew would be final no longer than it would take one side or the other to break it  --  Terry had yielded a co-equal command of the defense ministry and a small share of foreign policy to his cousin . Police control he kept for himself , and equal rank he would not concede , pointing out that it was a matter of blood and nothing he could do anything about . The headlines in the West were very encouraging : COALITION GOVERNMENT SOOTHS TROUBLED GOROTOLAND ; and , COALITION LAUNCHES NEW PEACEFUL ERA FOR AFRICAN NATION ; and , STRIFE-TORN GOROTOLAND EASED BY POPULAR-BASED GOVERNMENT . Walter Dobius and his world wrote and broadcast millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West who feared they might have to take a stand if things got sticky relaxed and took a drink instead . The " coalition " lasted for just over four uneasy months , after which the Communists made their first attempt to overturn it and murder Terry . He escaped , brought the drifting , mindless street mobs to his side by the sheer impact of his powerful personality , and drove Obifumatta , the coalition " ministers , " and their Communist supporters backThe World of Walter Wonderful 8ginto the bush . Obifumatta at once appealed to Peking and Moscow for help , received loud pledges from each , and filed an appeal with the United Nations . To Terry 's shocked dismay , all those elements in the Western world whose views were symbolized and sometimes synthesizedby Walter and his friends at once began to attack him and build up his cousin . " A genuine popular uprising somewhere on the globe is sometimes one of the healthiest things that can happen to this confused old town , " Walter wrote . " Washington this week is faced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also with its newest hero . Tired to death of Tiresome Terry , ' the brash and erratic young ruler of Gorotoland , influentialleaders here are welcoming with some relief the attempt by his cousin , Prince Obifumatta , to establish a truly democratic regime in the difficult African country . " Who these friendly American " leaders " were , neither Terry nor any disinterested observer could see , since President Hudson 's administration , far from embracing Obifumatta , had immediately pledged its support to Terry . But if Walter Dobius said so , a great many of his colleagues and countrymen were ready to believe that it must be true . Favorable reports on Obi at once began to flood the press and airwaves . " BATTLE FOR FREEDOM , " CBS offered : " A NEW LEADER RISES IN AFRICA . " " SPECIAL REPORT , " NBC countered : " WILL DEMOCRACY WIN IN GOROTOLAND ? " Pictures of Obifumatta speedily blossomed in all the places where Terry 's picture , so short a time before , had grinned upon the populace . The New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferred to Amsterdam the level-headed veteran who had been covering Central Africa and rushed to the scene its youthful **34;7629;TOOLONG . A flood of dispatches favorable to Obifumatta and derogatory to Terry immediately began to appear . When Obi 's mercenaries , either inadvertently or by design , broke into the All-Faiths Missionary Hospital at Molobangwe and carriedoff two white nurses into the bush , and when , two days later , one of the oil tanks at the new Standard Oil development in the highlandsarea of the country was mysteriously set afire in the night , the tempo increased . In Washington the President remarked , at first mildly in a press conference but then more firmly in a formal statement issued three hours later after consultation with the Secretary of State , that the United States would " not remain silent or idle " while American lives and property were under attack . Obifumatta immediately filed a new protest with the UN and the outcry doubled. 90 Capable of HonorWalter and his world now had exactly the sort of issue they loved  --  the brutal , overbearing United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation  --  and if what they said about it happened to coincide with the Communist line , well , that was just too bad . They were morally in the right , whatever the facts of it , and high and mighty was their indignation . " Rarely , " Walter wrote sternly , " has the United States been in a less graceful or more suspect posture than it is today in Gorotoland . True , two American missionary nurses have been abducted and are , presumably , dead . True , a Standard Oil installation has been attacked . But what were they doing there in the first place ? The world has seen too much of exploitation moving behind the cloak of mercy . The nurses may have thought they were there to help the natives of Gorotoland . Actually , they may well have been there as an innocent smoke screen for further adventures by the oil interests of the United States . " " OIL : HOW MUCH DOES IT STILL DICTATE POLICY ? " CBS obligingly offered two nights later , devoting roughly forty-five minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen to Terry and his probable shady tieup with Standard . " OIL : NEW SWORD OF EMPIRE ? " NBC riposted twenty-four hours later . " 13EIIIND GOROTOLAND'SCRISIS , THE SPECTER OF OIL , " the New York Times Sunday Magazine reported at week 's end in two thousand hastily written , characteristically objective words from its youthful **34;7665;TOOLONG . " OIL , " said Life simply , with a thousand words of text , seven pictures , and three bright maps . Caught in this kind of cross fire between the world of Walter Wonderfuland the Government of the United States , the 137th M'Bulu of Mbuele , though it took him a little while to realize it , did n't have a chance . Almost overnight , it seemed to him , all his support vanished . The friends who had hailed him so eagerly yesterday hailed him no more . In the sort of strange , fantastic , overnight about-face contortion that Walter and his world are all too frequently capable of , he who had been hero was instantly and forever villain . And the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter and his world got away with it . Apparently their readers and viewers were not aware of the switch , or if aware , were too bored  --  or too exhausted by innumerable past duplications of the performance  --  to protest or be skeptical about it . Within a month any mention of Terry , almost anywhere in the American press , carried with it the automatic addition , " youthful adventurer who acquired the throne by strangely suspectThe World of Walter Wonderful 91methods . . . " or , " suspected friend and agent of the oil interests ... " or , " leader of the anti-democratic forces striving to keep down the peopleof Gorotoland ... " or some other pack-cry honed and polished to do the most damage . In all this sad disarray of his hopes and fortunes , Terence Ajkaje had only two things going for him ; but they were , while they lasted , substantial . The British Government had immediately announced its support , and the Hudson administration in Washington , unlike some previous administrations , showed no inclination at all to be swayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . In fact , a week ago the President had reaffirmed his warning to the rebel forces , and to Obifumatta personally , that the United States would " take immediate and substantial action " if so much as one more American citizen or one more piece of American property were hurt . This was so unlike the decades-old pattern of the United States that for almost a day there was a stunned silence around the globe . Then Walter and his world , the Africans and Asians , the Communists , and indeed all Right Thinkers everywhere , let go with an outraged clamor that made their previous attacks sound like friendly greetings . It was then that the President had called Walter in to ask his advice firsthand and incidentally let him know that it was not going to be taken no matter how furiously he wrote . It was then that the Security Council decided in a heated emergency session  --  in which the United States , Britain , and Nationalist China found themselves standingalone against France , Uganda , Ceylon , Chad , India , Dahomey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Venezuela , and Panama , to take up Obifumatta 's appeals " at the earliest possible moment . " Only by dint of much behind-the-scenes maneuvering at the UN and in the capitals of the Council members had the United States and Britain been able to secure agreement that if Obi were invited to attend and testify , Terry should be too . And now here they were , though dismal and different indeed were their respective positions and prospects on this snowy night in Manhattan . Prince Obifumatta , just returned to his suite at the Carlyle ( paid for by voluntary contributions from Selena Castleberry , Poopy Rhinefetter , and a host of others anxious to Do The Right Thing ) , was giving one more gracious interview to one more group of friendly and obsequious questioners from the metropolitan press . Prince Terry was huddled uncomfortably ( if six-feet-seven could be said to huddle ) in the lobby of the Waldorf , looking fiercely proud and abysmally92 Capable of Honorlonely . Far away in Gorotoland Obi 's forces , coached by their Russian and Chinese advisers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coached by their American and British advisers . A temporary lull lay on the scene of battle as both sides awaited events in the UN ; but it was , as the Indian Ambassador had remarked today to the French Ambassador when they met at the luncheon given by the delegation of Cameroon , " an interesting and fateful scene . " " I think we have here the setting for quite a drama , " Krishna Khaleel had remarked with a hiss of concern , " though not , I think , a pleasant one , do you agree ? " Raoul Bane had responded with his sidelong , clever glance and skeptical smile . " The principal players are ready , as always , " he remarked . " Somedaythey will be ready and will actually perform . This may be the time . " " Oh , I hope not , " K.K. had responded with a horrified expression . " Think of the consequences . " " The world has worried about consequences for decades , " Raoul replied . " It may be tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Before the stormy night ended , consequences would indeed come , greatly increasing the tensions against which the Security Council would vote tomorrow , against which Walter Dobius would make his visit to the UN and , on Friday , his speech at the Jason Foundation dinner , greatly inflaming the angers and passions against which the presidential campaign would have to be played out . But for the moment , all that the participants , past and future , could see was what faced them right now . Most immediately , in the lobby of the Waldorf , all that Terry could see , dolefully , was that he had received a royal snub from two people whose friendship he had every right to expect . It was true that he had been a little hard on their government six months ago , but after all , their government was backing him now , so why could n't they be more cordial ? It was one of those things that left him baffled , depressed , and confused as he decided disconsolately that he might as well go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew what he would see if he did : hated Obifumatta , grinning forth from all those flattering programs and interviews , just as Terry himself had done six months ago when he , too , had been America 's enemy and the darling of America 's most powerful opinionmakers . The World of Walter Wonderful 93 " I 'm sorry to bother you , " Beth said , " but just what is your ex up to with this luncheon invitation on Thursday ? " " I 'm damned if I know , " Helen-Anne Carrew confessed . " He invited me , too , you know , which really indicates he wants to show off about something . I have n't been to Leesburg in four years . Something great must be under way . " " I 'm glad you 're going to be there , if you do n't mind my saying so . " " Oh , so am I. I would n't miss it for the world . It may well be the biggest story of the year . " " I hope not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's going to be off the record . " Helen-Anne snorted . " Nothing is off the record in this town , as you very well know . It 's just a matter of timing as to when things go on the record . Some sooner , some later , but they always get there , in the end . Personally , I hope they have a terrible fight . Orrin might as well , he has nothing to lose in that quarter . " " You really think so ? I 've been telling him he ought to let up on Walter for a while and maybe he 'll come around to supporting him , in time . " Helen-Anne snorted again . " My dear ! That hard-nosed little  --  no , he 'll never give Orrin a kind word again , no matter what . Not even if Orrin gets the nomination . It 's impossible . " " Why ? " Beth asked thoughtfully . " Disagreement over past policies ? Personality clash ? Ambitions the Jasons can satisfy and we ca n't ? I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislike for my hus- band . I know he is n't perfect , but still  --  you 'd think a little tolerance , now and then . " " Knowing the two of them , " Helen-Anne said , " I 'm quite sure that at some point very early in Orrin 's career here , he was advised by Mr. Wonderful on some subject or other , and being Orrin , he said , Go shove it  --  or "  --  she chuckled  --  " Orrin 's equivalent , because Orrin does n't say naughty things like that , only hard-bitten old newspaper bags like me do . In fact , I sometimes think that if Orrin would say things like that he 'd generate less dislike than he does with that way he has of acting as though he does n't think you have two brains to rub together if you disagree with him . " Beth laughed . " At least he 's honest about it . " " In a superior way which I suppose he does n't know and ca n't help , 94 Capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other member of a once great journalistic marriage may do , I want you to know that I hope sincerely Orrin makes it . If there 's anything I can do for him , I will . " " Why , thank you , " Beth said , trying not to sound too startled . " I 'm touched . Really . And surprised , I may add . " " I 've been giving it some thought , " Helen-Anne Carrew said slowly . " The longer I stay in this town the more I become convinced that honesty of purpose is the basic necessity in a good President . It is n't enough to qualify a man who has n't the other qualifications , but if he has them , as Orrin has , and then honesty is added to it , that 's the right combination , for my book . This is n't the smart point of view according to Walter and his friends , " she added dryly , " but I like it . " " I wonder , " Beth said cautiously , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year . " There was a thoughtful silence and she thought she had probably gone too far too fast . But presently Helen-Anne answered with a characteristically direct candor . " There are limits , of course . I ca n't use my column the way Walter uses his . Although , " she conceded with a chuckle , " I do manage to get my licks in , now and then . " " Yes , I know . I 've felt a few of them " " Ouch . All right , dear , if you want me to he honest  --  do you really think I could do more good in a partisan position  --  if either the dear old Star , tolerant as it is , or the syndicate , would give me leave to do it , which I doubt  --  than I could do indirectly through the column ? I wonder . " " Frankly , " Beth said , more moved than she wanted to admit , " I 'm quite overwhelmed that you think enough of him to consider the alternativesseriously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a hard-boiled old newspaper bag like you ! " Helen-Anne laughed . " I have my moments . . . . What did you have in mind ? " " Why , I would think . . . " Beth said with a deliberate air of consideration , " press secretary during the campaign . . . to begin with . " Helen-Anne gave her ribald hoot . " You 're all alike , holding out one carrot and then topping it with another , for us poor old spavined hacks in the press . Well , I 'll tell you one thing , lovey : if I were to do that job , you can bet your bottom dollar it would be done , and done right . That 's for sure . " The World of Walter Wonderful 95 " We know that . Why do you suppose it 's being offered ? " " Is it being offered , or is this just pleasant persiflage on a snowy night in the nation 's capital ? " Beth laughed . " Let 's put it this way : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , is it ? We are n't shouting at each other across a crowded room at Perle 's , are we ? I mean , this is cold-sober stuff , is n't it , girl ? What more do you want ? " " Forgive me for being suspicious , but I 've played around and stayed around this old town too long . I 'm afraid it wo n't be official until I hear from the man himself . Where is he , by the way ? " " Taking a shower . He was down talking to the President earlier , and  --  " " Oh ? " Helen-Anne said , instantly alert as Beth had intended her to be . " Any signs of a break in the logjam ? " " I 'm sure I do n't know what you mean , " Beth said lightly , " but , no , there are n't . " " I ca n't stand Harley 's wife for some reason , " Helen-Anne said , " but I love him . I 'd like to set off an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so our man can get moving . " " ' Our man ' ? That 's a good sign . I think you 're softening . " " Helen-Anne Carrew ? " that lady said in a disbelieving tone . " Softening ? You 're mad ! " " Think it over . It 's a firm offer and Orrin will confirm it Thursday if not before . " " I 'll be waiting . Sorry I have n't got the angle just yet on what the Leesburg Lion is up to , but maybe I 'll snatch it from some passing breeze in the next couple of days . I'lI let you know if I do . " " Thanks , dear . You 're a real friend . As well as a press secretary . " " We 'll have to see about that , " Helen-Anne said . " There are a lot of things to be considered before I  --  Hello ! " she said in a startled voice . " What 's that ? Is somebody trying to cut in ? " " That 's funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder what  --  " There was a definite clicking on the wire , a sudden urgent voice . " I 'm sorry , Mrs. Knox , " the White House operator said , " but weca n't seem to reach the Secretary on the direct line . " " I know , " Beth said , too taken aback to be entirely coherent . " He 's running the  --  the faucet thing in the shower . What is  --  can I  --  " " Please tell him at once that the President is calling the National Security Council , the rest of the Cabinet and the Congressional leaders to the White House in half an hour and he wants the Secretary there . " 96 Capable of Honor " Certainly , " Beth said . " Certainly . " " Thank you , " the operator said , and went off the line . " My God , " Helen-Anne said , " what 's that ? " " I do n't know , " Beth said hurriedly , " but I 've got to get Orrin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Helen-Anne shouted , and Beth shouted back , " I will ! " before she slammed down the receiver and hurried up the stairs to recall her soapily oblivious husband to the cold realities of a cold world . So began , for all practical purposes  --  and several days before Walter Dobius had thought he would begin it with his speech  --  the presidentialcampaign , with all its fateful consequences for so many millions of people . As the news spread out through the night  --  first a FLASH on the news-wires to the effect that PRESIDENT CALLS SECURITY COUNCIL CABINET TOP CONGRESS IMMEDIATE WHITE HOUSE SESSION , and then bulletin after bulletin of speculation , rumor , gossip , and non-news generated by the crew of several hundred nervously talking newspapermen and women who began to converge on the White House press room from their homes and beds all over town  --  as it spread on to New York , where it found Terry surprised and delighted as he thought he could predict the consequences , Obifumatta excited and gratified as he thought he could do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , argumentative members of the UN in the great cold city and found them shocked , appalled , dismayed , and/or delighted according to whose side they were on  --  as the news swept forward over London and Paris and Moscow ( where the corps of student rioters was told to prepare itself for another spontaneous attack on the American Embassy ) and Rome and Tokyo and all the rest  --  as it came over the short-wave on the chartered jet carrying Felix Labaiya home to Panama , and instantly changed and accelerated certain plans of his  --  and finally as it reached Leesburg and took Walter hastily to the telephone for a futile and angry call  --  even as it did all these things , its import and impact began to change and shift the emphasis of events even though the event itself , as the nations knew , was only half-completed . It would not be completed until a decision came out of that hastily called meeting at the White House . It would not be completed until action , or non-action , flowed out of that decision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , but would simply take its place in the mysterious and fearful story that the years still had to tell , flowing into the everbroadeningstream of events carrying a world too reckless to a fate too harsh . The World of Walter Wonderful 97AND THAT , Walter Dobius told himself as he arose nervously at 4. six the next morning , having stayed awake most of the night in gloom , foreboding , and disturbance , was a sample of what happened when you had an inexperienced dunderhead in the White House and a trigger-happy , irresponsible firebrand like Orrin Knox advising him . How on earth his poor country had got into such a tangle , Walter would never know . Certainly , reviewing the many warning columns he had written about Orrin , recalling the innumerable occasions on which he had given the President sound and irrefutable directions on how to proceed , he knew it was not his fault . Now all he could do , along with men of good will everywhere , was make some attempt , however futile , to help pick up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly dressed , ate breakfast and got ready to have Roosevelt drive him into town so that he might fly up to a United Nations racked and shaken by the latest fearsome turn of events . This time might be too much . This time , his awkward , ill-led country might have stumbled into the final morass from which neither it , nor the world it could pull down with it , would emerge . When he had heard the news last night of the rebel capture of Molobangwe , of the slaughter of thirty-five or possibly forty American medical missionaries there and the destruction by dynamiting , with further undetermined loss of life , of the Standard Oil installation upcountry , his first assumption had been that of course the United States would proceed like a civilized nation . It would take the matter to the UN and there tempers might be soothed , the crisis might be eased , the dead might be decently buried , and the damage decently forgotten in one more endless , if heated , debate which would prove anew that fine old UN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't shoot-ing . " This would , as Walter saw it , have been the right and proper thing to do . It is true that it would not have brought earnest good-hearted innocents back to life or really have justified their deaths , nor would it have restored ruined property or re-established broken law , but it would have been civilized , as the later twentieth century understood civilization . It would even , he thought with a bitter protest against all the hotheads and the extremists , have been Christian . It would have turned the other cheek . Above all , it would have kept the United States from placing itself in the position of aggressor. 98 Capable of HonorThe rebels who had committed the deeds which had brought from the United States so violent a retaliation were not , in Walter 's mind and in the minds , he knew , of most of the UN 's clamorous newly arrived nations , aggressors themselves . They were simply freedom-lovingchildren of nature seeking their God-given rights . The aggressors were those who reacted to them and called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressors were those who refused to concedethat freedom-loving children of nature had a right to hurt them and walk all over them . The aggressors were those who said murder and destruction were wrong and should be stopped . Those were the ones , in Walter 's mind and in the minds of all those many millions on all continents who agreed with him , who were in the wrong and deserved the condemnation of civilization in this enlightened , if perhaps somewhat topsy-turvy , century . Instead , what had happened ? Out of the fateful meeting at the White House  --  which he had tried to prevent by a furiously alarmed call direct to the President , which the President had refused to accept  --  hadcome a harsh and shattering decision , as uncontrollable and threatening to the settled fabric of life as a first thunderclap on the open plains : United States transport planes , carrying three thousandMarines , would be sent  --  indeed were already on their way  --  to invest Molobangwe . Units of the United States Indian Ocean Fleet would be sent  --  indeed had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even at the time the President , disgracefully , was telling Walter he did n't know what be would do next  --  to stand off Tanzania and furnish logistic support . Three squadrons of United States Air Force fighter-bombers , equipped with small atomic weapons , would be sent  --  indeed were already on their way  --  for stationing in the nearby Congo , no friend to Terry but less to Obifumatta . The United States , in other words , stupidly , fantastically , inexplicably , inexcusably , was for all practical purposes going to war . And over what ? Perhaps fifty murdered people and an oil monopoly 's property ! It was utterly insane , as Walter saw it , and not all the President 's mealy-mouthed hypocrisies could change the fact . The President had gone on television and radio after midnight . The broadcast was being repeated every hour on the hour . Walter had just seen it again for the fourth time , and still he could find in it nothing but faulty logic and hysterical emotionalism totally unsuited to the conduct of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought bitterly , until it got into the hands of two madmen like the President and Orrin . And now God help it ! He recalled with a scathing sarcasm the President 's words , a sarcasm whose angry vigor had already foundThe World of Walter Wonderful 99expression in the column he had written at top speed at 2 A.M. when he had heard the broadcast in its original delivery . " My countrymen , " the President had said gravely , flanked by Orrin and the Secretary of Defense , with the rest of the Cabinet , top Congressionalleaders , and members of the National Security Council ranged behind them , " six hours ago in the African nation of Gorotolandthirty-five or forty of your fellow citizens , medical missionaries and nurses , were deliberately and mercilessly murdered and mutilated by rebel forces running amok in the capital of the country . At the same time , less than two hundred miles away , installations of the Standard Oil Company , protected by treaty and agreement with the legitimate government of Gorotoland , were deliberately and wantonly destroyed by other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undeterminedadditional number of Americans were killed there . " These acts occurred despite the clearest and most specific warningfrom the Government of the United States , delivered to the rebel forces , as you know , a week ago . " In that warning , which many of you heard on your television or radio , or read in your newspapers , I said : " The Government of the United States further warns the rebel forces in Gorotoland , led by Prince Obifumatta , that if so much as one more American citizen or one more piece of American property is hurt , the Government of the United States will take immediate and substantial action . ' " Apparently it was decided by those backing Prince Obifumatta that the United States did not mean this , and that it would be safe to try the United States ' patience once again because nothing would come of it but an empty protest . " But now your fellow countrymen lie dead , mercilessly slaughtered in the most cold-blooded and deliberate way . Now American property lies in ruins , mercilessly destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option confronted me and your Government when the news reached me here in the White House two hours ago ? " Here the President paused and then ad-libbed what was , in Walter 's estimation , a most inflammatory and propaganda-filled statement . " It could be you I am called upon to protect . " It could be your property destroyed . " It could be you lying dead . " What would you have had me do ? " It had been quite clear to Walter that this bit of demagoguery had greatly pleased the Secretary of State  --  he was practically smirkingioo Capable of Honorwith joy , Walter thought  --  though most of the other faces ranked behind the President were grave and upset . But not Orrin the warmonger ! He looked happy . " Consistent with the position taken by your Government a week ago , " the President said , " and consistent with what I believe to be my obligation to every American citizen  --  here or anywhere on earth  --  and to every legitimate American property-holder  --  here or anywhere on earth  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Cabinet , the Congress , and the National Security Council . " We discussed whether to take this matter on appeal to the United Nations , as no doubt some of you would have wished . " My God , Walter thought , would have wished ! Then he 's already done something else . " This course , " the President said slowly , " I rejected . I re/ected , Walter echoed , phrases for his column already racing through his mind : then the President must have overruled a substantial group right in his own house . " I rejected it because the challenge was immediate and I felt the response should be immediate . I did not want to wait weeks to have others decide whether Americans had been hurt . I knew they had been hurt . " ' Oh , you demagogue , ' Walter told the portly figure before him on the screen , you demagogue ! ' " I also knew , " the President said dryly , " that others would get the matter to the United Nations fast enough . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do about the facts that existed . My worry was how to act . " He paused and took a drink of water , wiped his lips carefully on a handkerchief , and went on . " I did act . I have acted . Supported by my advisers whom you see here before you , I gave orders , which are already being carried out , to dispatch appropriate air , Marine , and naval forces of the United States to the nation of Gorotoland . These forces have orders to protect American lives and property and also to restore order to Gorotoland so that civilized law may prevail and all individuals , native as well as foreign , may be protected and safe . My God , Walter thought savagely , you 're going to establish a protectorate . You 're going to administer a free and independent nation . My God , how can you ignore what I and all other sane and civilized men have been advising the country all these years ? " These forces of the United States are on their way at this moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive in Gorotoland at 6 A.M. Washington time this morning . " They will proceed to carry out their orders . " If anyone attempts to interfere with them , " the President said calmly , " he will be dealt with . " He paused and looked straight into the cameras . " I want you , and I want the world , to know exactly why I have done this . I have done it because it seemed to me that it was time to take a stand . It was time to put a stop to the wanton destruction of American lives and property . It was time to defend the law of civilized nations . It was time to stop the steady slide that we have seen in recent decades toward the complete breakdown of responsibledealing between nations . You call this responsible ? Walter cried in his own mind . You fool , is this responsible ? " It was time to re-establish the fact that when America says something , she means it . Specifically , it was time to re-establish the right of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go anywhere in safety on the face of this globe . " The President 's final words were soft but unyielding . " I have had enough of the other . There will be no more of it . " I hope you will understand my reasons . I hope you will support them . I have committed you to what I believe to be the honorable course . I hope for all our sakes that you agree . " And then , as always ( Walter described it to himself bitterly ) there had come that damnable national anthem that fogs over any President'swords with a haze of stupid patriotic emotionalism , and the thing was over . But it was not over , anywhere on earth . The special edition of the Post that was delivered to him by special messenger every morning was waiting beside his breakfast coffee , placed there by a purselipped , worried Arbella . It was index enough to what would follow . U.S. MOVES ON ( not " in " ) GOROTOLAND , the headline said . MOSCOW , PEKING ISSUE ANGRY WARNINGS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think of this , Arbella ? " he had demanded sharply . " Do n't you think the President is insane ? " " No , sir , Mr. Walter , " she had replied firmly . " They only one way to deal with bandits , I say . I like it . " " Well , " he snapped . " There will be plenty who wo n't . " " That 's right , Mr. Walter , " she agreed with what could only be the insolence of long association . " I expect you 'll tell ' em not to . " 102 Capable of HonorAnd so , by God , he would , he thought as he reviewed once more the column he had written in the night . His mood had been savage and the column was savage . He had changed it hardly at all before he had called the syndicate at 3 A.M. and dictated it so that it could be rushed out at once to replace the rather dull one on gold outflow that he had filed earlier . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it began . " So we are going to war on a distant continent , for unworthy and indefensibleobjectives , in a contest in which nine-tenths of the world is automatically against us . So American imperialism is reborn , helped to new life by the monstrous midwifery of Harley M. Hudson and Orrin Knox . So stands the United States , convicted of aggression by its own foolish act . What will history make of so insane , futile , and foredoomeda decision ? " How arrogant they are , these little men who have placed the United States in a position that is an affront to civilized mankind everywhere ! How serenely they talk , as though they had all the answers ! How savagely has mediocrity achieved its revenge upon all those superior minds who have for decades sought with patient care to weave the difficult fabric of peace . How quickly is all their painstakingeffort vanished now ! " The President tells us that he had to decide what to do . Apparentlyit did not occur to him that civilization has a mechanism , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Apparently he did not recall that the use of force has long ago been condemned by the decent men of all nations everywhere . Using the flimsy pretext that freedom-loving elements in Gorotoland , seeking the just achievement of their just desires , may have inadvertently attacked and possibly killed a handful of Americans and may also have damaged an oil monopoly 's plants , Harley M. Hudson has committed his country to what amounts to a state of war in the middle of Africa . " The President says , I rejected ' suggestions by some of his advisers that he make the appeal to the United Nations that would have been the only honorable , civilized course . Obviously , then , it was his decision alone , overriding the grave doubts and objections held by many who participated in last night 's fateful conference at the White House . " For this grave crime against humanity Harley M. Hudson will have to answer to history , as will the man who clearly urged him on , Secretary of State Orrin Knox . " The President talks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gorotoland . Did he really believe that any self-respecting governTheWorld of Walter Wonderful 103ment , seeking the full dignity and freedom of its long-suffering , coloniallysuppressed people , would do anything but reject such a humiliating ultimatum ? How could it , and still hold up its head among the nations ? " It was , in effect , an invitation to do exactly what has been done  --  to punish the United States and so give proof , to those foolish , irresponsible , and shortsighted men who still need proof , that in this forward-marching century the world can not be run by ultimata from Washington . The response was exactly what could have been respected . And history , it seems likely , will say it was exactly what was deserved . " What , now , of Peking and Moscow ? Are we to assume that they will sit idly by and let the United States work its will in Central Africa ? Rightly they fear renewed imperialism , justly they think they see a new attempt to re-established colonial control . Are they , whose entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the battle to spread freedom and peace throughout the world , to do nothing while the world 's latest torch of freedom is wantonly and ruthlessly put out by superior force ? " The President and his war-happy principal adviser are sending American boys to die many thousands of miles from home , in an inconvenient and inaccessible terrain that can not be either easily captured or adequately defended if it is captured . He is throwing away your sons and your money in pursuit of a purpose no decent man can defend , engaging American fortunes and forces in a hopeless war far away at a time when the nation 's domestic needs are crying for solution . All this he is doing in the name of the honor of the United States . " Never has it been so sadly misjudged or so dreadfully defended . " War is what the President and the Secretary of State are committingin Gorotoland . World war is what trembles on the edge of what they do , waiting only the slightest misstep to unleash its awful nuclear horrors upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your country . It needs your prayers as never before . " And never before , Walter told himself with an iron satisfaction , had he written truer words than those . And never had he been more confident of their soundness or more certain that he should send them forth to the world . It was insanity that the President and Orrin were engaged upon , the dreadful insanity that can end nations and end worlds . It was up to him , he realized as he trudged out through the heavy104 Capable of Honordrifts to the car where Roosevelt waited to drive him to the airport , to him and to all other decent men and women in America , to stop it if they could . Helen-Anne thought he never got really angry , did she ? Well , this time she 'd find out  --  they 'd all find out  --  that he could . A thin , bitter line settled around his lips and stayed there . Roosevelt , normally sunny and chatty , made no attempt to talk as they passed slowly over the slippery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had succeeded the world 's dark night . Far below on the East River the barges , tugboats , and freighters maintained their ceaseless commerce ; across on Long Island the world was a smudgy gray , clean snow contending with drab buildings , drab buildings winning out . But when he had entered the shimmering glass monolith of the UN Secretariat Building to take the elevator to his office on the thirty-eighth floor , the air had been crisp and clear , the sun had been steadily warming . Winter 's last storm would not lie too long on the land . Spring , at any moment , would he here . And what a spring it promised to be , the Secretary-General thought sadly as he let his black , knobbled old hands rest idly on his desk and stared out the window , not really seeing the lovely day that was developing . What a spring , and how would men survive it to see summer , or the autumn that would follow , or another winter after that ? Somewhere along the way in the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something to make it impossible , the flywheel would spin out of the creaking machinery , the whole great game would end , the centuries ' old pretense that man could determine his own destiny would collapse in one final , obliterating NO brought on by man himself . Man could determine his own destiny  --  if that destiny were destruction . That was clear enough . It was beginning to seem increasingly unlikely to him that man could exercise the slightest control if the destiny were to be anything else . That apparently lay entirely with the God or gods to whom man prayed , when he remembered to pray . Thinking of all the raucous , brawling , undisciplined nations and non-nations that snapped and snarled in the Security Council , the General Assembly , the committees , and the conference rooms that lay below his fragile and impotent aerie , the S.-G. gave a heavy sigh , the sigh of an old man who has seen too much and accomplished too little , in his own estimation , to have made it all worth the struggle . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had learned so soon that the Communists had no intention of permitting him to exercise any real influence upon events , had found himself attacked by hisThe World of Walter Wonderful io5fellow Africans and Asians for his decision to be fair to the white nations , had found all hopes dissipated in the conflicting hatreds and suspicions that swirled constantly like a sickening and fatal gas through all the handsome chambers below . The UN was dying , it had been dying for years , and why had it been given to him , he wondered bitterly , to preside over what might well be its final agonies ? There lay before him on his desk the latest earnest pamphlets of all those well-meaning and good-hearted American organizations which still insisted , in the face of all the evidence , that the raddled organization was a strong and effective force for world peace . He had also seen on their television screens and heard over their radio the defensive , anguished pleas to believe in a dream whose guardians had wrecked it long since . THINK WHAT YOU WOULD DO WITHOUTIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOU IT IS N'T WORKING ! Well : he was its Secretary-General , and he knew . Every honest observer in the world knew . Yet here were the Americans , pretending with a desperate anguish to the end , that somehow by sheer incantation and appeal they could put life back into something that was already , insofar as its original purpose of being an effective peace-keeper was concerned , a corpse putrescent and overduefor burial . This was the fact , and not all the desperate pamphlets and all the defensive statements and all the indignant outpourings of scorn upon those who acknowledged the fact could change it in the slightest . Long , too long , after the UN had been weakened and dragged down by its own members into a howling shell of what it could have been , powerful groups in America were still pretending that it was the vigorous and hopeful organization of their long-ago dreams . The Secretary-General could not understand this on the basis of reason , though he could understand it on the basis of fear . They were so dreadfully afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however empty , of their hope of peace . They were so frantically unsure of themselves when confronted by the possibility of a world in which they might have to stand on their own feet , take the consequences of their own acts , be unable to avail themselves of this comforting fiction to which to pass the buck for their own errors . They wanted the UN propped up and kept there so that they could run to it like children and hide their faces in its skirts . But the skirts were empty , the sought-for womblike comfort long gone , if it had ever really existed after the first ten minutes of the organization 's life . They knew it , as he did , but they would not give up the pretense . They were too afraid. io6 Capable of HonorNot so , ironically , the Africans and Asians who had done so much , with their exaggerated fears of the colonial past , to bring the UN down . It was the greatest thing in the world for them to be able to come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , and live in luxury while they went to the Assembly or the Security Council every day and denounced America to the accompaniment of fine , approving notices in the American press . To use one of those skeptical , ironic , knowing American phrases that so often went to the heart of things , they never had it so good back in the bush . But they did have , back in the bush , the comforting assurance that no matter how irresponsible they were , no matter what they said or did , the UN would continue to exist as long as the Americans could possibly preserveit  --  a free and protective shield from behind they could spit out their hatreds of America and make a bitter mockery of its earnest , awkward , well-meaning hopes that somehow , sometime , somewhere the world might discover dignity and peace . And now America had finally given them real cause for hatred , and most of them , he knew , would be in a manic frenzy when the Security Council met at three this afternoon . The President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a deep yet troubled sleep in which he had been chasing , with dragging feet and arms so dreadfully heavy that he could not raise his spear , some impossibly bright and golden lion in his native Nigeria . He had known at once that something of dreadful import must have occurred . He had also realized that the call was a great courtesy , for he need not have been informed ; few others bothered to inform him . His gratitude increased when he realized that the President was actually asking his advice , as much as Presidents ever could . The President had told him what had happened and had asked what he should do . Did the Secretary-General think that any purpose other than a futile and foredoomed attempt to appease the vague phantasm " world opinion " would be served by refraining from stem and direct action ? Did he see any hope of affirmative support in the Security Council or the General Assembly if the United States should go through the procedure of submitting the issue ? " You answer a first question with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We both , I. think , know the answer to the second . Therefore the first need hardly have been asked , do you think ? " " Probably not , " the President said . " But I felt it should be , out of respect to you . " " Thank you , " the S.-G. said , feeling flattered . " I think , in any event , that you need have no doubt that the issue will be submitted to theThe World of Walter Wonderful 107Council , as it is already seized of Prince Obifumatta 's complaint against your ultimatum . " " Call it what you will , " the President said , " I felt it had to be done . " " I am afraid Obifumatta , too clever , like his cousin , did not foreseethat you were laying the foundation for future action . " " I am afraid Obifumatta has not foreseen many things . Very well . I am sorry to have disturbed you , but I wished you to know what to expect and I also wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you so desired , as being opposed to what I am about to do should I decide to do it " The Secretary-General had permitted himself a wry chuckle . " Opposed to what you will do should you do it , " he repeated . " Mr. President , even if I were warning you against it  --  " " Are you ? " the President asked quickly . " Each of us must act as his fate decrees . " " I thought as much . Understand me on one thing : I do not minimize the consequences at all . They may be ultimate . But I feel we have no choice . " " The world is becoming full of no choices , " the Secretary-General said sadly . " Daily the choices diminish . It is a world of no choices . " " And Obifumatta and his friends have just reduced them further , " the President said grimly . " As they no doubt thought you did with your ultimatum , " the Secretary-General ventured . The President sighed . " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the right . But I do not believe it . I think their actions always spring from the most abysmal cynicism and the most utter contempt for human decency as we understand it . I think this is the essential fact underlying all the others . . . Thank you again . My advisers are waiting for me to tell them what they may advise me to do . May all go well until we meet again . " " Which will be ? " " Who can say ? I may address the Assembly myself before this is over . Though not for a while , yet . Events must develop for a time , first . Nothing would be gained now . " " If that is your opinion , " the Secretary-General said . " When you are ready  --  " " I shall let you know . " " May all go well with you , too , Mr. President , " the Secretary-General said , moved by a strange combination of sympathy , understanding , pity , and fear. io8 Capable of Honor " My thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The S.-G. had rolled back into his pillows , though not to sleep for several hours . Always there was the fear that the United States might be provoked too far ; always there was the possibility that her patience , which usually was sufficient to withstand any amount of attack , opposition , disparagement , and contempt , might abruptly snap ; always there was the awesome possibility that she might explode into some violent and drastic action whose consequences could not be foreseen , much less controlled . It had happened in Asia , it could happen in Africa . Apparently this was to be one of the times . Nothing but disaster lay ahead for anyone , as the Secretary-General saw it . He knew that in the morning he would have to receive a constant stream of visitors from the rooms below , all furious , all shouting , all demanding that he do something . Do something ! He had done all he could , though he would not admit it to them . He had in effect told the President to go ahead , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimates of the decision might be dreadful beyond imagining . Now the first howling visitor was about to arrive . The graceful Swedish girl who was serving as his principal secretary this year entered the room . " The Soviet Ambassador wishes to see you , " she said . The Secretary-General sighed and nodded . Now the bad day would begin , and in the worst possible fashion . He sat very still , bracing himself for the screaming denunciation he knew was about to come . " Good morning , " the familiar voice from the Senate said with a certain dry amusement . " I hope you 're well rested after our busy night . " " I 'm not exactly chipper , " the Secretary of State admitted . " You , I suppose , are fresh as a daisy and have nothing to worry about , up there on the Hill . Do n't relax . I 'm going to give you something . " Robert Durham Munson , who was senior United States Senator from Michigan and Majority Leader of the United States Senate , uttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a minute . What do you want us to do ? " " The obvious . A concurrent resolution supporting the President and affirming the determination of Congress to stand by him until Gorotolandis pacified . " " And the world is made safe for Standard Oil ? " Bob Munson inTheWorld of Walter Wonderful 109quired in a mocking tone that parodied all those who believed as much . " And missionaries and Americans abroad and honorable dealings betweennations and so on , " Orrin Knox said impatiently . " We were all agreed on this last night . I just want it put in a form the world will recognize . What 's the matter with that ? " " Have you seen Walter Dobius ' column ? " " I have . " " It 's having some effect , I find . " " So ? And are we supposed to run from Walter ? " " No , I 'm not saying anything about running from Walter . I 'm just saying it 's having some effect . I 've already heard from quite a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are n't we ? " Orrin asked in a scornful tone . " Do the dolts think we went into this lightly last night ? " " No , but people like Fred Van Ackerman and Arly Richardson , for instance , are convinced from Walter 's column that there was a terrific split at the White House and that Harley overrode us all and dragged us kicking and screaming off to war . " The Secretary snorted as he thought of Fred Van Ackerman , junior Senator from Wyoming and perennial troublemaker , and Arly Richardson , junior Senator from Arkansas and not much better . " Seven negative votes out of thirty-one ? " he demanded . " That 's a terrific split ? They 're just making trouble , as usual . " " I 'm not arguing what the facts are , " Bob Munson said patiently . " I 'm arguing what Walter Dobius says they are . The two need n't be the same in order to satisfy Walter 's followers . His word is sufficient . " He made an amused sound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's a new description of Orrin Knox . " " Walter 's hysterical . I 've known him to write some strange things , but this one takes the cake . I think he 's gone mad . " " Obviously he thinks the same about you . And , as I say , there are some who are going to agree with him . A great many , I suspect , before it 's over . Over there . " " How could we have done anything else ? " the Secretary demanded . " How could we  --  " " I 'm not arguing , " Senator Munson said , " I 'm not arguing . I was there last night . I voted for it . I 'm just philosophizing on the great gap that exists between what a situation actually is and the picture of it that people like Walter can create in the public mind if they have sufficient distribution . I sometimes think there ought to be a law . " no Capable of Honor " There is . The First Amendment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge their version of things . " " Walter 's a special case , though . He does n't only fight through his column now . He 's become too big a wheel in the Washington world for small potatoes like that . He 's called me this morning . Guess what he wants . " " " A resolution opposing it , " the Secretary said . " Exactly . " " He is mad . " " I reminded him that in twenty-five years of columning here he had never yet seen a Congress fail to support a President in an internationalcrisis . He said this might be different . He sounded as though he really thought so , too . Very grim is Walter Wonderful on this bright sunny day . What 's this Dolly tells me about him going to receive the Jasons ' Good and Faithful Servant Award Friday night ? " " So I hear from Helen-Anne . Do n't worry , you 'll be invited . Quite inadvertently events seem to have played right into his hands as far as timing 's concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let go with both barrels . " " I suppose Patsy set the whole thing up so he could come out for Ted , " Senator Munson said . " Apparently . Now he 'll be in even better shape to do so . Unless Ted supports the President . " " How could he ? Would n't that be supporting you too ? " " Oh , some people might be broad-minded enough . Or patriotic enough . Or honorable enough . Or some other old-fashioned concept like that . I doubt if Ted will curb his ambitions at this moment , though . If Walter really does represent a major segment of the population , it seems like a bandwagon tailor-made for Ted " " The neo-neo isolationists ? " Bob Munson suggested . " How many contortions poor Walter and his friends have had to make in recent years ! " " I feel deeply for them , " Orrin Knox remarked . " It 's touching to watch Walter , in foreign affairs , stand on his head , rub his stomach , wiggle his ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one and the same time . " " Nominating Ted is going to hurt you , though . You know that . " " Certainly . I do n't minimize it . However , that 's still assuming that Harley wo n't run again . I do n't see how he can avoid it , now . Ted is n't the only one who has things tailor-made . " " Oh , I expect this will die down in a week or two , do n't you ? " BobThe World of Walter Wonderful iiiMunson asked . " I doubt if it will take any longer than that to get things settled . You 'll still be in the running . " " I 'm not so sure , " Orrin said gloomily . " Who can say how long a crisis is going to last nowadays ? We may be in there for years if things do n't fall just right . I do n't think Peking and Moscow are going to let stability be restored without a contest , do you ? As usual , they 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a devilish place for them to supply , " Senator Munson remarked . " Us , too . But that is n't going to stop anything . Nor do I see why it should . Sending American boys to die many thousands of miles from home , ' Walter says . Well , is n't that too bad . He sang a different tune with Hitler . " " He always sings a different tune with people he does n't like . " " Except when he 's afraid of them . Unless you assume that Walter Dobius and his crowd are Communists , which strikes me as ridiculousin spite of what some wild-eyed people say , then the only logical explanation of their erratic positions over the years is that they 're so afraid of war that they are willing to bow down to anyone who appears to threaten it . " Bob Munson chuckled . " I believe they would prefer the word negotiate ' to the words bow down . ' It amounts to the same thing , but negotiate ' smells better . Maybe you 're right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , you want a resolution , then . Have you talked to Bill ? " " The Speaker of the House is n't in yet , so his office just informed me . Rather primly . " " Must be a new girl . I 'm ready to go , over here . I 'll have Tom August introduce the resolution as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , right after the opening this noon . " " I 'm sure the Speaker will go along too , " Orrin said . " Thanks , old pal . When are we going to get together for something social ? " " The Jason Foundation dinner Friday night appears to be the first opportunity , " Senator Munson said solemnly . " I 'm sure we 're all going to be there , are n't you ? " " I do n't know , " Orrin said thoughtfully . " Have you talked to Harley , " Senator Munson asked , " and has he seen Walter 's column ? " " Yes and yes . Our mild-mannered old friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd advise you both to keep calm and prepare for a savage lashing from the press . This is one of those many times in recent years when all112 Capable of Honorof America 's finest minds are going to be telling the world that the worst thing in it is America . And those who got her into this . " " It seemed the only thing consistent with honor . " " Not honor as they see it . " " Thank God I do n't wear their glasses , " the Secretary of State remarked . " Keep me advised on the resolution . " " Sure thing . Keep me advised on the candidacy . " " I want to talk to you about that one of these days soon . " " No point until Harley decides , is there ? " " He 's got to say something soon . The time for drift is ending , particularlywith Gorotoland on the griddle . I imagine it wo n't be long , particularly after Friday night . " " You do n't think Walter will show his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Munson suggested . " Usual restrained and dignified fiddlesticks . He 'll be raving . " " The whole thing is such fun , " Senator Munson said gently . " Give my love to Beth . " " Likewise Dolly . Keep in touch . " The Speaker , when the Secretary reached him ten minutes later , was equally cooperative on the resolution , equally intrigued by the public hullaballoo . " Should have thought of the resolution when we were all togetherat the White House last night . Do n't know why we did n't , Orrin . Must have been too many other things on our minds . When you going to announce for President ? " " You think I should , when I 'm a monstrous midwife to a third world war ? " The Speaker chuckled . " Yes , I see where friend Walter got a little heated this morning . I expect he 'll carry a good many with him , too . Scare you ? " " No , it does n't scare me . The only thing I worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be for me . " " You ca n't include me there , " the Speaker said with the comfortable assurance that was his from years of unassailable power and control over his unruly branch of the Congress . " Told you a year ago at the time young Brigham Anderson died that I 'd be for you , and I am . Folks like Walter been trying to scare me for forty years . They never have . " " Thank you , Bill , " the Secretary said with a genuine gratitude . " You 're one big plus I have on my side , anyway . You do n't know how much it means . " The World of Walter Wonderful 113 " First , though , " the Speaker said , " we 've got to blast Harley loose . He may not want to blast , Orrin . " " I 'm quite happy either way . Honestly I am , Bill . I think you know me well enough to know that . " " I know , I know , but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much damage is Walter going to do in this Gorotoland busi-ness ? " " Quite a lot , I think , " the Speaker said gravely . " He called me this morning early , you know . Wants the House to pass a resolution opposingit . " " He 's an egomaniac . " " He is n't modest , that 's true enough . However , we 'll pass your resolution , all right , and plenty to spare . But it wo n't stop some of ' em making a hellish row . " " Will Jawbone Swarthman introduce it for us ? " " Now , there 's an example , " the Speaker said regretfully . " Much as I love Jawbone  --  and I do , you know , I 've known him since he was a little tad coming up here when his grandfather was in the House from South Carolina  --  he can be as slippery and stubborn as one of those Carolina mules sometimes . I 'm afraid this may be one of ' em . " " It 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House Foreign Affairs Committee wo n't back the Administration in a crisis like this . " " Oh , I 'm working on him , " the Speaker said . " Do n't worry about that . But he 's pretty riled up . Tends to agree with Walter Dobius , I 'm afraid , that we should n't send American boys thousands of miles from home . At least , "  --  the Speaker chuckled  --  " not to meddle in any colored folks ' family quarrel , as Jawbone puts it . " " Jawbone is n't a fool , " the Secretary said sharply . " He knows perfectlywell this is another pitched battle with the Communists . Why did n't he speak up last night at the White House if he had all these qualms ? He voted for it then . " " That 's what I mean when I say slippery , " the Speaker said . " Jawbone'sdoing a lot of thinking about the folks back home these days . Now that Seab Cooley 's dead , God rest his soul , that South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ambitions , you know . Plenty of ' em . " Orrin made an impatient sound . " What on earth does he want to go to the Senate for ? He 's got fifty times more influence as chairman of House Foreign Affairs than he 'll ever have as a member of the Senate . What does he want it for ? " " He 's never really been comfortable with foreign affairs , " the Speaker said . " Jawbone would much rather have been chairman of Agricul-114 Capable of Honorture , worrying about all the cotton and taters on the old plantation back home . Plus the fact , Orrin "  --  the Speaker gave a wry little chortle  --  " plus the fact , much as I hate to admit it and you must never quote me , that for a lot of people , an awful lot of people , the title of United States Senator somehow means more than the title of United States Representative . They just like to have it . " " And for that Jawbone is going to give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? I 'll talk to Jawbone ! " " Now , Orrin , now , Orrin . Easy does it . You can talk to Jawbone , but you let me do some talking first . I think we can ease him around , but it may take a little time . " " This resolution ought to go through at once if it 's going to do any good . " " It may just not , " the Speaker said . " Better brace yourself , if you and the President are counting on it . It may just not . The folks who agree with Walter ca n't stop it , but they can slow it down some . Particularly when it 's all involved with the presidential election . That makes everything extra touchy . " " Are you going to the dinner for Walter Friday night ? " " Patsy called and invited me last night just as I was leaving for the White House . I told her I did n't know whether I 'd be in town , but if so , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . Also be inter- esting , " he added dryly , " to hear what Ted 's going to say about this Gorotoland business . I expect he 's being asked . " " I 'm awaiting a blast any minute . Or he may just he clever enough to keep still . We 'll see . " " I 'll bet he 's under plenty of pressure to speak out , " the Speaker said with a chuckle . " I feel for him , " Orrin said , realizing he had said the same thing to Bob Munson about Walter , and realizing that it came from the same commingling of impatience and contempt for those who could not see their country 's best course as clearly as he could . Or , as he reminded himself with the saving grace that kept Orrin Knox from being insufferable , as clearly as he thought he could . " Darling , " Patsy Labaiya was saying at that very moment from the house in Dumbarton Oaks , " you know we 're counting on you to intro- duce Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now  --  collect , of course  --  and consult with him about it ? Then you can also tell him that Walter and all his friends back here do hope that he 's going to issue a strong statement condemning this latest insanity by the Presi- dent and Orrin Knox in Gorotoland . Could you do that , darling ? " The World of Walter Wonderful 115Downtown in the marvelous gingerbread structure known as the Executive Offices Building , or , more historically and affectionately , as " Old State , " the director of the President 's Commission on AdministrativeReform swung around in his chair and stared across West ExecutiveAvenue at the White House . It was gleaming so brightly in the sun that Robert A. Leffingwell felt he could touch it if he reached out a hand . The snow was melting fast on the roof ; as he looked , a large section slid off and doused a couple of photographers emerging from the press room . He could almost hear their shouted profanitiesas they jumped back . It lent an amusement to his voice that Patsy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " he said . " I might or I might not , at this point . I do n't just know yet . " " Do n't know ? " Patsy demanded in some dismay . " Well , it is n't any laughing matter , I can tell you that . " " I 'm not laughing at you , " Bob Leffingwell said . " I just saw a couple of friends of mine get socked by the snow over at the White House . It melted and fell down on them . Anyway , why ask me to talk to Ted ? He 's your brother . You two are still speaking , are n't you ? " " He knows what I think , we do n't have to communicate on a thing like this . It 's important that other people talk to him , though . " " It might be important for him to stay out of it for a day or two , " Bob Leffingwell suggested . " He ca n't be hurt by keeping his mouth shut , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't agree . I think it 's imperative that he say something right now while things are at their peak . " " Do you think that this is their peak ? I have a feeling we ai n't seen nothin ' yet . " " Even more reason why he should speak out , " Patsy said firmly . " And you , too , I might add , especially if you 're going to be associated with him in the campaign . Have you read Walter 's column ? " " Yes , I read it . " " Well , then , " she said triumphantly . " You agree with it , do n't you ? " There was a thoughtful pause and she repeated in some alarm , " You do agree , do n't you ? " " I told you , I just do n't know , " Bob Leffingwell said slowly . " I thought Walter was a little extreme . In fact , I thought he sounded hysterical . It did n't really sound like Walter at all . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he obviously feels very , very deeply . He obviously feels this is THE END . " " Even so , " Bob Leffingwell said in an unimpressed voice , " I thoughtu6 Capable of Honorhe went overboard . Quite amazingly so , for Walter . I wonder if he 's losing his touch ? " " He is not losing his touch , " Patsy said sharply . " He is just simply frightfully concerned about this insane act by the President and Orrin , that 's all . Are n't you ? " she demanded in a challenging tone . " Do n't tell me YOU 'VE gone over to the enemy . That would be the day ! " " Of course I 'm frightfully concerned , " Bob Leffingwell said with a show of annoyance rare for one normally so suave and self-possessed . " Do n't be a fool . Everyone 's frightfully concerned , and I 'll thank you not to impugn my intelligence or integrity . " " I 'm sorry , darling , " Patsy said hastily . " I just got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't going to side with Orrin and the President on this , are you ? It would be so DREADFUL to have you on the other side . I did so want you , " she added forlornly , " to introduce Walter Friday night . It would have made it so perfect for Ted . " " I did n't say I would n't introduce Walter . I just said it 's a situation that requires some thought and some restraint . I do n't know if I want to associate myself with everything he says if he 's going to be as rabid as he was in that column this morning . " " I still do n't think it was rabid , " Patsy said stubbornly , " but if you do , I suppose I ca n't change you . But honestly , you do n't want to be with Orrin and the President , do you ? It 's one of those issues that narrows down to just where does a man stand . You 've got to make a choice , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is Ted going to fight the campaign on this issue ? That would be interesting . " " He may be forced to . It may be one of those things a candidate ca n't avoid , you know . Especially with the enemy taking the other position . " " Who is this enemy you keep talking about ? " Bob Leffingwell asked with some amusement . " If you mean nice old Harley and volatile old Orrin , that seems a slightly fierce way to talk about them . " " I think that 's the kindest tone I 've heard you use about Orrin since he  --  since a year ago , " Patsy said . " You really ARE N'T going over to him , are you , darling ? " " I doubt it very much , " Bob Leffingwell said in a voice that was suddenlyquite crisp as they both remembered the way in which Orrin , then senior Senator from Illinois , had blocked his nomination to be Secretary of State . " Even so , " he said , less arbitrarily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to oversimplify a situation like the present one . I think it is a time to be reasonable and mature in our judgments of it . " The World of Walter Wonderful 117 " Darling , " Patsy said in a wistful tone , " you do n't sound liberal at all , any more . You sound just like a REACTIONARY . Do n't you think Orrin and the President have oversimplified ? Do n't you think they should have been reasonable and mature ? Do n't you think what they 've done is dangerous ? " " Of course I do , " he said with a renewed impatience . " But I 'm not saying I might not have done the same had I been  --  had I been in a position where my advice was sought . It was n't . If it had been , I could n't honestly tell you at this moment what I would have coun-seled . " " Well , " Patsy said , really dreadfully shocked at this apparent betrayalof what everyone on the Right Side had always thought Bob Leffingwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to introduce Walter , then , we 'll just have to get somebody else . But I had so hoped  --  " " I repeat , " Bob Leffingwell said , " I 'm not saying I wo n't introduce Walter . In fact , I will . But I 'm going to reserve the right to qualify my own position as I see fit . " " You want it both ways , " Patsy said , though she told herself she must n't be spiteful , it would only antagonize . " You want to be in both camps at once . I never thought I 'd live to see the day when Bob Leffingwell abandoned his principles . " " Perhaps Bob Leffingwell is learning a few , " he said crisply . " Give my best to Ted when you talk to him , because I 'm not going to , at this point . " " He would value your advice , " Patsy said soberly . " That 's the only reason I asked . " " My advice is to keep quiet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I do n't suppose he 'll take it . " Sitting in his office in Sacramento , however , staring thoughtfully down at the crowds of state employees hurrying to work along the walkways of the Capitol , the Governor of California was not being as hasty as his friend feared and his sister desired . It was still early in the West but already the full flood of Eastern opinion was shrieking from the headlines , blaring from the radio , snarling with a suave indignationfrom the television screens . The little turns of phrase that ( lo so much to tear down something Walter and his world wish to tear down were everywhere apparent to the perceptive citizen : " The sudden and abrupt American move against Gorotoland ... . An action which many Americans themselves regard as indefensible . ... A situation in which the rebels , apparently seeking only to establishan independent government free from colonial control , are sudn8 Capableof Honordenly confronted with the ghastly ghost of colonialism , strangely revivedby the West 's leading democracy . . . . A minor skirmish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of issue that could destroy the world . . . . The President 's inexplicable , and many people f eel , inexcusable decision .... " Walter and his world had wasted no time , and dutifully the chant was being picked up in the West as well . Ted Jason sighed as he looked at the state 's morning papers spread across his desk . The homogeneity of Walter 's world impressed him anew . It had been increasing every since World War II until now it was virtually a solid mass of automatic opinion , swinging on cue against this issue , for that personality , as though someone punched a button . From Manhattan to the Golden Gate the cry was predictable , consistent , and virtually impenetrable by any dissenting opinion . When the big boys in the big city spoke , those who considered them the epitomeof sophistication wanted desperately to speak like them . In pursuitof that goal , a blanket of conformity stultifying to thought and murderous to genuine discussion lay upon the nation . Orrin and the President , Ted told himself grimly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It would n't matter much if the entire populacestarted out solidly behind them , Walter and his world would do their damnedest to swing the balance the other way . And if , as was certainly the case now , many Americans were divided , uncertain , and confused , the current might be too strong for even the President to overcome . Should Ted , then , swim with it and seize what advantage he could ? The way was open and it could be easy . Perhaps the President , all unknowing , had handed him the key to the White House after all . Quite possibly he had if Orrin ran , and  --  heady thought  --  perhaps he had even if he himself should run . Governor Jason was absolutely certain that if he issued a strong statement denouncing the President 's decision , the entire apparatus would be his to ride as far and as high as he could . And that , he realized with a cold-blooded calculation as he studied the harshly self-righteous journals before him and remembered the indignant and condemnatory broadcasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far and high indeed . Still , there were other things . He had to admire the President 's guts , taking such an action on the very eve of a campaign : such things were usually deferred until after , when politically it was quite , quite safe . Many a stanch defender of the nation was braver after November than he ever was before . Harley Hudson had preferred to meet the issue head-on and do it now . So , too , had Orrin Knox , who had goneThe World of Walter Wonderful 119into it with his eyes open , knowing it was to be a decision that he too must carry should the President retire and he become an active candidate for the nomination . Ted Jason , not for the first time , was forced to admire the courage and integrity of his principal opponent . And his own courage and integrity ? Recalling how Ceil , very glamorous and Givenchy as always , had paused in the doorway to look back at him this morning , he had wondered if these qualities were showing signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must dash , " she had said with her cool little humorous air . " That thing the P.T.A . convention is putting on , you know , that breakfast for distinguished ladies . Of whom , " she commented with an amused expression , " they seem to think I am one . I shall try not to make a speech . If I do , I shall try not to mention Gorotoland . But , my dear "  --  giving him that long , slanting glance that he sometimes felt might penetrate his defenses , though it never had and they both knew it ; but Ceil kept trying in a humorously halfhearted way  --  " my dear , what about you ? Can you get by without , today ? " " I do n't know , " he had confessed . " Do you think I should ? " " Whatever you decide I shall be for , " she said with the look repeated , the humor exaggerated . " I 'm a politician 's wife . I go along .
