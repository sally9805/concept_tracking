WELL before the 1 p.m. voting hour , the galleries of the capacious old marble-and-leather chamber were bulging as the Senate gathered last week to vote on the Supreme Court nomination of Clement Haynsworth . Vice President Spiro Agnew arrived a full ten minutes early ; the vote was expected to be close , and he could break a tie . As the clock on the Senate wall reached 1 p.m. , the chamber hushed , and the roll call began . The outcome hung on the votes of seven uncommitted Senators , and everyone who had any business being there knew who they were . Nevada 's Alan Bible , a Democrat , was the first of the seven to be called . He said " No , " and the audience gasped . Other nays followed , and then Quentin Burdick , Democrat of North Dakota , cast the 51st negative vote . " That 's it ! " someone yelled . Agnew slumped in his big leather chair . Haynsworth had been beaten , and by a surprisingly decisive 55-to-45 margin . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay the prestige of his presidency on the line for Haynsworth . His nominee was the first to be rejected by the Senate since 1930 . <P> Low-keyed . Thirty-eight Democrats voted against Haynsworth , but the margin of defeat was provided by the President 's own party . Seventeen G.O.P. Senators-including the top three leaders-defected . To do so , they had subjected themselves to some of the toughest manhandling to come from the White House in years . Nixon confined himself to low-keyed sales pitches , but Attorney General John Mitchell and White House Aides Bryce Harlow , Harry Dent and Clark Mollenhoff adopted hard-knuckle tactics . For weeks , the struggle was a bizarre mixture of moral controversy , party loyalty , political animosity and crude pressure , all played out in an atmosphere of recrimination and threatened retaliation ( see box , page 16 ) . <P> Local party leaders and contributors were enlisted to threaten to cut off Senators ' support . Cabinet members warned of possible lost patronage . Bearing down on Republican William Saxbe of Ohio , a White House operative ordered Ohio loyalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order was canceled , but not before Saxbe got wind of it . He was enraged . " I do not know who has stirred up the people of Ohio to threaten me to vote for Haynsworth or face retaliation , " he said . Declaring his independence from all outside pressures , Saxbe added : " I will not jump through a hoop for industrial fat cats or labor leaders , " and in the end he voted no . So did Oregon 's Mark Hatfield , who angrily complained that conservatives had threatened to oppose him in the next primary . <P> Mitchell " leaked " the information that Minority Leader Hugh Scott promised to vote for Haynsworth if his vote made the difference ; the " leak " was false , designed to force Scott into making it come true . Scott voted nay . Democrat Thomas Dodd was reportedly threatened with indictment over his alleged misuse of campaign funds ; rumor had it that he was shown the indictment . But he too voted no . " During my more than seven years in the Senate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues have generated more pressure on my office . Support of the President is urged as if it were a personal matter rather than an issue of grave constitutional importance . " Another no.
