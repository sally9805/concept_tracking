txt Casablanca , Morocco The Peking government is trying to repair damage done to Chinese Communist prestige here by Premier Chou En-lai 's reported remarks about revolutions and foreign control in Africa . Morocco and Mhiopia , both countries which Mr. Chou visited during his recent 10-nation African tour , were special targets of critical remarks which the French news agency attributed to him at a news conference he gave at Mogadishu , Somalia , on Feb. 4 , just before he returned to mainland China . The New China News Agency issued what it said was the " full text " of the correct version of Mr. Chou 's statements . In it the critical remarks in the earlier Western version , which aroused a storm of protest here and in Ethiopia , have been replaced by purely complimentary ones . According to the original version , Mr. Chou said , " There is an excellent revolutionary situation on the African continent . " Mr. Chou added that the " reactionary conception of the word revolution " did not correspond to his own . " Certain countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first step , consisting of attaining independence and getting rid of colonialism . Others are still fighting for independence . " When a newsman asked Mr. Chou , " Do you place Morocco and Ethiopia among the countries which have not yet attained independence , " the older text gave this reply : " They have their independence but are still under the control of foreign interests , though Morocco has freed itself from American influence . " Mr. Chou then held up the Presidents of Algeria , Guinea and Mali and Premier Fidel Castro of Cuba as statesmen who " wish firmly to continue the true revolution . " King Hassan 's government , which was host to Mr. Chou last Dec. 27-30 and that of Emperor Haile Selassie , who received him Jan. 30-Feb. 1 , both indicated their displeasure . One newspaper close to Foreign Minister Ahmed Guedira described the Peking regime as " idolatrous . " In the later Chinese Communist version the only reference to Morocco is a statement that " when the Moroccan people obliged the United States to withdraw their military bases from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
