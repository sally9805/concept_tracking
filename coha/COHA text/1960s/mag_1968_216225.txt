Footnotes to history : <P> In 1964 , Lyndon Johnson was seriously thinking of making amiable Mike Mansfield , majority leader of the Senate , his running mate instead of Hubert Humphrey . That way , the President reasoned , Humphrey could become majority leader , giving L.B.J. far more forceful Senate leadership and Humphrey a bigger reputation for an eventual presidential campaign of his own . It would also have spared Humphrey what was to become one of his most onerous burdens-his overly close association with an unpopular Administration . There were reports last week that Humphrey , too , had some unorthodox ideas this year about his own running mate : he wanted New York 's Republican Governor Nelson Rockefeller to join him on a unity ticket . Humphrey aides denied it , insisted that the Vice President always wanted Maine 's Senator Ed Muskie on his ticket . <P> Initially , Humphrey thought Richard Nixon would be an easy target . The Chicago debacle changed his mind . In retrospect , Humphrey believes that he might have made more headway with Eugene McCarthy 's dissidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even before the convention , he had a speech ready saying that he might try a bombing halt if elected . But he was persuaded to wait until the end of September by advice from Paris that an earlier announcement might have hampered the peace talks . Humphrey , unlike many supporters and pollsters , does not believe that a few more days of campaigning would have brought him the victory . He feels that he received nearly all the votes he was going to get . <P> Doubtless Humphrey will discuss these points in his memoirs , which Doubleday plans to publish next year . In the meantime , Humphrey will probably lecture at the University of Minnesota , lay plans to replace McCarthy in the Senate if the donnish dove does not run again in 1970 , and spend the next two years helping Democratic National Chairman Larry O'Brien recoup the party 's $5,000,000 to $7,000,000 campaign debt .
