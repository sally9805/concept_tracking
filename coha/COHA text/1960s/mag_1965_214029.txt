West Germany 's Mideast muddle unhappily reminded its citizens of just how fickle is the good will they have worked so hard to accumulate since World War II . Declared Britain 's Central Jewish Organization last week : " A German government which 20 years after Hitler is prepared without shame to sacrifice the vital needs of Israel will be condemned by all men of good will . " <P> In New York , three sizable U.S. textile companies canceled contracts with West German suppliers in protest . " Once again , as we did in 1914 and 1933 , we warn the world that the German bell tolls again , " announced the Jewish War Veterans of the U.S.A. in full-page newspaper ads . " We believe that the weaknesses and defects latent in the German character once again have begun to show signs of dominating German life . " <P> Deep Regret . Replied Bonn 's ambassador to Washington , Heinrich Knappstein , in letters about the ad : " I was appalled ... I deeply regret this attack on a government and a people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible at all-to make up for the past . " Some Germans wanted to do even more . For all the ties developed over the years , Bonn has never formally recognized the state of Israel . Last week German students in West Berlin paraded for Israeli recognition as one answer to Germany 's critics . <P> For the moment , though , much of the Germans ' hurt and dismay over the new hostility toward them was vented on Chancellor Ludwig Erhard and the CDU-which could conceivably lose the national elections in September over the Middle East fiasco , as CDU strategists privately admitted . But the issue went deeper than German politics . Protesting against the " new wave of distrust , " Die Zeit in a front-page editorial noted that there is a " new generation " of Germans which knows Nazi crimes " only from history books and which therefore finds it hard to comprehend that being a German is a flaw of birth . For the sake of this generation , we may be forgiven for saying : One can not treat a nation like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he proves the contrary . " <P> No Expiration . A second major cause for the new criticism of Germany had more justification than the arms cutoff . Last November , Erhard 's Cabinet voted not to extend West Germany 's 20-year statute of limitations on war crimes . Though some 70,000 Nazi criminals have been sentenced , prosecutions pending against 13,000 others would be dropped if the statute is applied . Nearly 75% of the German mail to the Bundestag on the statute of limitations was in favor of letting the law lapse . But in the face of mounting foreign criticism , the Cabinet last week reversed itself , agreed to support legislation to extend the period in which war criminals may still be apprehended and tried .
