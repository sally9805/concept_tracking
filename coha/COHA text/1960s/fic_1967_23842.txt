Marion , Ohio 43302 THE YARD A Story by Charlton Ogburn , Jr . The men were straggling in through the gate beneath a sky the color of the gray floes remaining from winter in the river . Estes , the personnel manager , watched from the window beside his desk . He watched impassively and not from interest but to put off the moment when he would take up the day 's work . If an expression had crossed his face it would have been one of revulsion . He knew all the men by sight , many of them by name , and a good deal about those who had been on the payroll for any length of time . Part of his job was keeping his eyes and ears open . Increasingly his job seemed to him only a drain down which he was pouring his life , but he did it conscientiously . Where would he be without it ? That hulking figure now going by in the trousers and jacket slick with dirt  --  that was Worack , John P. , he of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mouth in a fixed , stupid sneer . Recently he had slugged his wife and brought on a miscarriage , but the police , to whom the intern nn the case had reported , had had to let him go , in default of charges . Estes , who had called at the house by way of giving the husband a warning , had expected to be hard hit by sympathy for the stricken wife  --  he should have known better by now ? but , sitting up in a sagging bed with her graying hair disheveled and a gray , man 's sweater over her nightgown , malevolent little eyes set in a puffy face , she had proved to be every inch a slattern . Her grievances , and they were far-reaching , were not against her lord , who was standing sullenly and uneasily by , but against the Company fur not doing right by that dim-witted brute and barely competent welder . Cassiny , Michael J. , who now was passing , was a drinker . Master steam fitter he might be , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexion and the glistening , slightly bloodshot eyes of the Drunkard , with the capital letter  --  what today they called an alcoholic . He could not wait till the five o'clock whistle anymore but had to have his nips on the job , beginning in the morning . Estes had given him two warnings and one fine day now would have to knock the chocks out from under him , as he had from under several before him in whom even the union took no interest . That would send him down 56 THE YARD the slippery slope that gave no foothold , up which there was no crawling . Two coming along side by side were Ronney , Arthur L. , and Salvan , Joseph Leonard , both electricians . The former was talking , of course , but it was impossible to say whether he was being listened to . Salvan , who was short , held himself tightly together and erect , and seemingly aloof . He was a dresser . Even now , reporting for work , he wore a close-fitting black overcoat , pearl felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Salvan bore himself with an air of prosperity and authority that his wages would hardly have accounted for . He had been in trouble with the law and even done a six-months ' hitch before he came to work for the yard ; it had all been a matter of being deceived by some neighbors he had been trying to help , he had explained . Estes. watching from his window or passing between buildings , had seen him in brief colloquy at lunch hour with rather more men , one after another , than the most social disposition would have led him to seek out  --  and these encounters were so underplayed as to seem hardly to be taking place . There was little question but that the swarthy electrician with his built-up shoes had some kind of gambling operation going on . Estes reflected that he had better crack down before he was called in on it by the Owner , who never missed anything discreditable to anyone . He wondered if he would be asking for trouble  --  if there were a mob behind the operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab trying to sell obscene pictures , was a woman chaser . Estes knew his reputation , and with this the sleek softness he had about him was in keeping . He had even features , though with rather much curve of the nostrils , and his small teeth , which he was constantly displaying , were as alike as kernels in an ear of corn . He might have been reared in a harem , and Estes wondered whether his want of aggressive manliness might not explain the success he evidently enjoyed with the objects of his insatiable advances ; they might have felt that the liberties he took hardly counted , not much more than the ministrations of a hairdresser . Once at lunchtime when he was walking by a knot of men to whom . Ronney was holding forth one of the listeners had called out to him , " Hey , Mister , get a load of this ! " All had looked at him expectantly to see how he would take this forwardness . They treated him with a show of deference in which a touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to come as close to impudence as possible without requiring him to take overt cognizance of it . They were like children . So , challenged to stay for Ronney 's lubricious recital , he stood by , half-waiting to resume his progress across the yard , neither one with the men nor altogether apart , a fixed , faint smile on his lips . If the men had a tightrope to walk in testing him , he had one to walk in responding ; he must be neither above himself nor below . Ronney had inched himself forward , as if he would seduce his audience as he did his other prey . The feature of the conquest he described was that it involved sisters whose favors , if he was to be believed , he enjoyed more or less concurrently during an evening of carousal . Estes left with a remark as near noncommittal as he could make it without delivering a snub . He was disgusted , not so much by the facts  --  part of him was actually envious , which compounded his disgust  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What a commentary on human nature that there should be anyone for whom the passing favor of an audience like this should be compensation for the sellout of all reticence and self-respect ! Stedman , Henry , another welder , had the gait  --  the way of placing the feet , of holding the arms slightly akimbo  --  of the fastest draw in the West crossing a saloon , conscious of all eyes on him but not deigning to look to either side . Maybe some such fantasy governed his life . But there was nothing in the realm of fantasy about his ugly temper ; it smoldered visibly in his clotted face . His fists were real , too . He was dangerous . The other men  --  and who was he , Estes , to call them cowards ? ? treated him with a falsely genial and respectful circumspection . Well , someday , and that probably soon , a piece of machinery would fall on our Harry and there would be an end of it . Dragging along , the last to get in under the bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first or middle name , only initials . Though a passable painter , he was probably classifiable as a moron . His jaw was unnaturally long , his mouth generally ajar . Estes retained a vivid recollection of having been at a table adjoining his in the cafeteria across the street and having had to move off because of the noise he made as , his face only a few inches above his plate , he had gulped in the stew . Christ , what a collection ! " Up late again last night ? " It was Mrs. Lorkin , personnel secretary , who raised the question . She had just conic in . " Do T look it ? " " You sure do n't look very cheerful . " She had taken a face towel from her desk and was on her way to the women 's room . Pausing by the door , she asked . " Did you lose ? " " You ca n't win all the time . " The stakes were small and interested him only a little . Poker itself he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him an excuse for getting away from the apartment . There were other ways in which he would have preferred to spend evenings out but no others that would not have provoked Norma 's suspicion and reproaches . " You do n't care for anything but yourself ! I think you despise me ! I think you enjoy seeing me suffer ! " When she was having one of these seizures she could not control herself . The angry passion in her face contrasted with the miserable twisting of the handkerchief in her hands . She tortured herself with thoughts of other women . He told himself it was some deep psychological insecurity complicated by their lack of children that led to these outbursts , but , if that was it , knowing it did not help much . " Will we go on with the new pay records ? " Mrs. Larkin , Estes guessed , was encased in her girdle like a sausage in its skin . Her dress he thought was probably inappropriate ; it was short-sleeved ( she was one of those women who do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheen . Ile said he thought they had better . Norma even imagined carryings-on between him and Pearl Lorkin . He wondered what excesses or deficiencies in temperamental makeup would give a man an appetite , as presumably Mr. Lorkin , while alive , had had an appetite , for a woman so devoid of femininity  --  a matter , he thought , of her rather large , insensitive features and matter-of-fact address . It had been a mistake to mention to Norma , however facetiously , his secretary 's habit of edging forward in her chair , which caused her skirt to draw back and expose a section of gartered , mushroom-white thigh above the stocking-top . However , he grew desperate for things to talk to his wife about . She imagined that she hungered for details about his working day but really was not interested ... Ile wished Mrs. Lorkin would not chew gum , which she did audibly , with lips curled back . Any remark about the " tone " of the office would , however , have come with doubtful grace from him since , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was at home sick , as there was no reason why she should not , she had found three or four salacious paperbacks in the rear of a drawer . " Say , you 've got quite a taste in books , " she had declared heartily . An economy of speech was characteristic of their communications but he was thrown off balance . " Yeah , I 've been wanting to make sure this business is something generally practiced , not just something I dreamed up as a naughty boy . " It was one of his weaknesses , pornography was . One of a number . Another was that he smoked too a story by Charlton Ogburn , Jr . 57 much  --  as Norma did not neglect to remind him . He was , when it came down to it , not much of one to be hypercritical of the men  --  the louts ! Maybe it was chronic sourness in the stomach that made him sour in outlook . Or maybe it was the other way around . Anyway , he was going to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Could he be getting an ulcer , like the Owner ? The Owner had reason for one , trying to hold on in a marginal industry while his wife spent whatever it took to keep her head up in society , which must be plenty . Photographs of her appeared in the paper from time to time showing her as a patroness or sponsor of this or that , her smile one of a person exchanging with a rival barbed remarks masked as civilities . The coming-out party for D2 , as the plain-looking second daughter was called around the yard , must have cost five grand , Estes guessed . In a way , he wished he could sympathize with his employer , as he could when he was away for any length of time . When they were together the man got his back up as he did everyone else 's . Lean , a little stooped , thin-lipped and sharp-nosed , Mr. Emmett Vance Peabody was a relentless presence , driven , humorless , mistrustful of everyone . " If he wants to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him look to himself , " Estes had exploded to the chief designer . " What a way for the head of a company to act  --  like an old-maid schoolteacher ! Into everything , always at everybody . You would n't believe it if you had n't seen it , and every day at that . ' I think the paint would take better if we dealt first with the rust ' spot . ' ' If we 're a little more careful with molten solder there wo n't be the danger of its dripping onto the insulation below . ' What does he think we have foremen for ? And if he wants to keep the foremen from quitting , why does n't he stop setting them to rights in front of the men ? It 's not just his pettifogging interference , either . It 's that pained , if-I-may-justmake-a-su ggest ion way of catching you up .

Only just glances at Charlton Ogburn , Jr . has written in many fields : for example , " The Marauders " ( about an American guerrilla regiment in Burma in World War 11 ) , " The Gold of the River Sea " ( a novel set in the Amazon valley ) , " The Winter Beach " ( a travel narrative about the Atlantic shore ) . He is now working on a geological history of the United States for the Smithsonian Library .
