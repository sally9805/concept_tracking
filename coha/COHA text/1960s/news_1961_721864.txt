txt PARIS , June ** the Khrushchev-Kennedy conf r on tation proved is that , although it has turned polite , the cold war continues . Thee Russians in no sense seem anxious for a showdown ; but this will be an uneasy summer . The Vienna meeting hinted that Khrushchev 's private troubles with China still influence his policy . The ' only implied understanding was that a cease-fire in Laos is importnntindicative that even the Russians admit this does n't yet exist . The next few days should show us how far they are prepared to move . However , in this instance , the attitude of Peiping weighs heavily . One suspects the Russians got into the Laos affair primarily because both they and the North Vietnamese wanted to keep the Chinese out . There were similar intimations that Mao 's views affect prospects of a nuclear test ban . Khrushchev left a paper with Kennedy showing unwillingness to accept any inspection or control machinery until our foreign bases had been liquidated , conventional weapons limited and atonic arms outlawed . Again one suspects Peiping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compact Moscow signs . The ' Troika ' System Khrushchev reiterated to Kennedy that he regards as a fundamental his insistence on the so-called troika system of negotiation at all levels . In other words , for every representative of the Western and Soviet blocs there should be a neutral representative . Thus peace at no price remains Soviet policy . Khrushchev was hn peccably polite in explaining this and flared up only once , when Berlin was under discussion . He showed no sign of being impressed by Kennedy 's argument and aide-memoire that we could brook no iferference with our legal powers in are former German capital because Berlin , to us , symbolized our entire position in Europe . Khrushchev handed Kennedy a paper asserting that the whole German question , including Berlin , should be resolved within an unspecified negotiation period . He did not stipulate when this negotiation should start but some experts believe he , means only after the Soviet Communist party congress next October . In any case , if there is no settlement ' he insists he will sign a separate East German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and before talks are held . We have told NATO , de Gaulle , Adenauer and Macmillan that we do n't think Khrushchev is going to push too hard or swiftly but that he ' shows no faint desire to cede anywhere in the name of peace . On neither side were there important or original approaches . Nevertheless , there was some value to the colloquy . Kennedy wanted to see just what kind of man Khrushchev is . The President , reckons it is important for him , as the ultimate decision-maker , to know the human element . Thus , for example , he realizes he can receive contradictory advice on many issues from intimate advisers in Washington ; yet , knowing each personally , he can make allowance for their disparate views . A Sizing-Up He now sees Khrushchev as an intelligent , resolute opponent . Likewise , those in a position to analyze Khrushchev 's reactions believe he waS impressed by Kennedy as a modern man , not cluttered up with old formulas . The President has done his homework well and never needed to consult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mass psychology , could hardly fail to observe Kennedy 's superior appeal with Vienna crowds . Of course , to those disciplined by the-habits of dialectical materialism , individual personalities count for little . But Khrushchev could hardly fail to realize that the Western position , as bespoken by Kennedy , remains essentially determined . One might describe the two Ks ' meeting as a zero with a rim on it . The rim was a reaffirmation of established positions and a sizing up of adversaries . There was no talk of another summit nor of a Kennedy visit to Russia , although Khrushchev , in a toast , said the President would be welcome should he choose to come . He does n't . Indeed , there was really nothing at all save a promise by the Russians to do.in Laos what they already claimed to have done . Nevertheless , now each side knows for certain where the other stands . And our allies have been reassured that we are consulting them more elm ( - ' ly . Much consultation will be needed before this nervous year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
