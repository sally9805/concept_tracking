ESSAYS AND INTRODUCTIONS ( 530 pp. ) - William Butler Yeats-Macmillan ( $6.50 ) . <P> When William Butler Yeats paid his first visit to that high priestess of occultism , Madame Blavatsky , the lady 's pet cuckoo came out of a broken Swiss clock and cuckooed at him . It would be frivolous to call the encounter a recognition scene , but in some ways the poet and the bird were wackily well matched . Yeats was a genius , probably the 20th century 's greatest poet . But his private life and personal beliefs were filled with quirks and oddities , mystical beliefs and spiritualist devotions . Essays and Introductions , published in book form 22 years after his death , is a voyage into that other area of Yeats 's life . Behind the book 's orchidaceous rhetoric lies the cult of beauty ; behind that lies the mystique of art as religion ; but behind everything lies the knowledge that however strange his notions , they somehow fed the glories of his poetry . He did not mind seeming foolish : <P> . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be praised of all ; 0 what am I that I should not seem For the song 's sake a fool ? I pray-for fashion 's word is out And prayer comes round again- That I may seem , though I die old , A foolish , passionate man . <P> Vampire for Hire . Merely to contemplate what Yeats seriously believed in is enough to stagger the modern reader . He had , or vowed he had , complete faith in ghosts , fairies , magic , table rapping and spiritualism . He attended seances religiously , and once claimed to have seen a man in black and a hunchbacked woman fashion human flesh out of mysterious chemicals . At another sance , at which the spirits became very annoyed , witnesses reported that " Willie Yeats was banging his head on the table as though he had a fit , muttering to himself . " Yeats sometimes primed the medium via telepathy , but he doubtless was not amused by the " seer " who responded : " I have a vision of a square pond , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see an oblong pond . " On another humorously humorless occasion , the poet deputed a vampire to plague one of his enemies . The reckless , insane logic of the spirit world sometimes pursued Yeats far beyond the seance rooms . Years after his long , frustrated courtship of the hauntingly lovely firebird of the Irish Troubles , Maud Gonne , had ended with her marriage to another man , the fortyish Yeats showed up in her home on the coast of France and promptly proposed marriage to Maud Gonne 's eleven-year-old daughter , a scene that might bring pause even to the imagination of a Nabokov.
