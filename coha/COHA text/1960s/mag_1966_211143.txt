My city 's better than your city . In the Middle Ages , they proved it by erecting the biggest cathedral , in the Renaissance , by commissioning the grandest city hall , in the 19th century , by bolting together the most cavernous railroad station . In the 20th century , cities began putting their pride in the sky and , until lately at least , the sky scraper sufficed as the symbol . Now the high-rise office has an even skinnier cousin , the cloud-busting television tower-generally equipped with a slowly rotating restaurant at the top . <P> For its TV transmissions , Tokyo duplicated the Eiffel Tower , only 40 ft. higher . Other antennas have risen in Cairo and Teheran . But the erection of TV towers has reached epidemic proportions only in Europe , where local papers breathlessly report every increase in height , meter by meter , as the towers rise . <P> And how they rise ! London , 620 ft . Stuttgart , 702 ft . Dortmund , 715 ft . So much for Rotterdam 's 365-ft. - tall Euro-mast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have evolved over centuries , who cares ? They make such great tourist attractions that a commission of Hamburgers seriously suggested that their tower , now under construction , be designed with a built-in lean to woo tourist dollars away from Pisa . It wo n't , but there 's a consolation : in addition to doing the things that other TV towers do-transmitting radio and TV signals and conventional phone calls-it will buzz any motorist equipped with a simple and inexpensive receiver , signaling him to go to a telephone and call his office or his home . Besides , when it is completed a year from now , it will be , at 892 ft. , the tallest tower in Germany . That is , until Munich 's 951-ft. tower is finished a few months later . But then . East Berlin will have one 1,185 ft. tall by 1969 . West Berlin may counter with a 1,312-footer . <P> No matter . Moscow 's tower is already taller than the Eiffel Tower , and when it is completed a year from now to celebrate the 50th anniversary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , 250 ft. more than the Empire State Building . Muscovites will enjoy dining in its revolving three-story restaurant . Distant viewers will love having TV programs beamed directly from Moscow over the Urals to Vladivostok and Yakutsk . And Aeroflot pilots will be mad about it : with its antenna tips swaying 23 ft. in the wind , it will be the greatest aviation obstacle in Moscow .
