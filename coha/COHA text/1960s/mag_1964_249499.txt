It is one of the proudest tenets of American law that any accused person is innocent until proved guilty . Yet each year thousands of Americans who have been charged with a crime but not yet brought to trial spend weeks and sometimes months in prison . They stay behind bars simply because they can not afford the price of bail . In an effort to correct the inequities of a practice that , in effect , discriminates against the poor , 450 judges , district attorneys , lawyers , and police from all 50 states gathered in Washington for the first National Conference on Bail and Criminal Justice . <P> The conferees were all too familiar with the problems . Most judges set bail according to the crime . They give little consideration to a defendant 's background , character or financial status . And the man who holds the key to freedom is not even a member of the court ; he is a professional bondsman , in business to make money , understandably leary of poor defendants who can neither put up collateral nor pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what to do about it ? By far the most impressive answers came not from a lawman but from a retired chemical engineer named Louis Schweitzer , who reported on a bold new experiment that may soon revolutionize the U.S. bail system . <P> Interview Through Bars . It all started 31 years ago when Schweitzer , now 65 , met New York City Prison Commissioner Anna Kross , who took him to visit a Brooklyn detention prison . He was shocked by the large number of pre-trial prisoners and donated $70,000 to set up the Vera Foundation , which he named for his mother ( because " I thought she would have liked what I was doing " ) . In cooperation with the New York University Law School , Schweitzer 's foundation set up the Manhattan Bail Project , which has been operating for 31 months on a trial basis in Manhattan Criminal Court . Each morning , after the newly arrested prisoners are herded into the detention pen to await pretrial hearings , a team of Vera staffers , who by night are N.Y.U. law students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores well on a four-page , detailed questionnaire-job , family status , previous convictions , etc. - Vera staffers quickly verify his story by telephoning friends and employer . If it checks out , they rush a one-page recommendation to the judge , asking that the prisoner be " released on his own recognizance " - freed on his own promise to return for trial . <P> In the project 's early months , Vera staffers cautiously recommended the release of only 30% of the prisoners interviewed ; now they intercede for 60% . At first the judges followed the foundation 's advice in only half of the cases , but now they turn loose 70% of the prisoners for whom Vera vouches . This remarkable trend is based on equally remarkable results . Of the 2,300 prisoners-ranging from muggers to embezzlers-that Vera has recommended for release , less than 1% have failed to show up for trial v. a 3% no-show rate in Manhattan for defendants who were free on regular bail .                    @
