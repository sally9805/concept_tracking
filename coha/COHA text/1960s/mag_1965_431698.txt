 | Judo : Mayhem With a Gentle Touch THE WALK home from school was a daily ordeal for nine -- year-old Paul . He was a well-mannered boy who wore glasses , liked to read , did n't care for sports and consistently received the highest marks in his class . And he knew that every day Danny would be waiting to trip him , twist his arm or run off with his books . D ) anny was no wickeder than any her 11-year-old who is big for his age and likes to pick on smaller boys . But Paul , outweighed by 25 pounds , was helpless against him . When , one day , Paul tried to fight back , Danny rewarded him with a bloody nose , two black eyes and broken glasses . That was the day Paul decided he 'd have to do something about the situation . Some months later , on a spring afternoon in the school playground , Danny got the surprise of his life . He tried to grab Paul 's cap as he had done so many times before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his foot , and the ground came up at Danny with the force of two flying tackles . Danny found himself lying on his back . It was accidental , of course , but the bigger boy was infuriated . Leaping to his feet , he hurled himself at Paul with both fists flying . But somehow Paul @#  | was n't there ? and Danny found himself somersaulting through the air . This time he did n't get up until Paul walked away . That was the end of the smaller boy 's nightmare . With his parents ' consent , Paul had been spending several evenings a week at a " dojo , " or judo school , where he had joined the quarter of a million American men , women and children who are discovering the ancient Japanese art of selfdefense . Less than a generation ago , judo was as foreign to this country as Sanskrit . Today almost every major U.S. city boasts at least one heavily attended dojo . New York has 25 , San Francisco 50 . At the 1964 Olympic games , judo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , attracted teams from 26 countries . In Britain , France , West Germany and Brazil , judo contests receive nationwide attention . To get an idea of what judo is like , become a judoka yourself . You can give it a try at New York City 's Judo , Inc. , one of the nation 's oldest and most respected dojos , where a former concert pianist named Jerome Mackey has taught the sport to nearly 10,000 men , women and children during the past decade . Mackey , a soft-spoken , zoo-pound Oklahoman , says that anyone without a heart condition or other internal disorder can safely take up judo . Like all dojos , his establishment ? a huge single room covering the entire second floor of an office building ? is designed for action only . It is bare of furnishings except for three small tiers of wooden seats near the en ? trance . On the floor are thin straw mats . You may find an advanced class limbering up prior to a workout . The students , men and women alike , wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the young , slightly built Japanese instructor snap out an order , the pupils instantly face him in line . At another corn mand , they kneel and bow to hi Returning the bow ( in judo , the bowing ceremony is the equivalent of shaking hands in the boxing ring ) , he steps back and gives third order . Now the pupils pa off , each seizing the other 's le lapel and right sleeve to commence what looks vaguely like the twist . Knees slightly bent , arms pistoning back and forth slowly , the partners circle easily about the floor . All at once a slight youth gives sharp cry and falls backward , simultaneously putting a foot into bulky adversary 's stomach and catapulting him four feet into the al A slim blond housewife yells shrill makes a small motion with her 1 foot , and a man with the build of piano mover goes down as if t mat had been pulled out from and him . Another shout , and a balding middle-aged gentleman crouch whirls in a 18o-degree turn and flip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions has been completed in less than two seconds . The ki-ai , or short , stabbing yell that 1 965 JUDO : MAYHEM WITH A GENTLE TOUCH 139  | companies attack , almost invariably " freezes " an adversary for the split second that is needed to floor him . The " losers " are back on their feet quickly , unhurt . And after each throw the partners exchange deep bows from the waist before seizing rich other again . For more than half an hour the throwing continues , punctuated only by the formal bowing and the instructor 's commands and demonstrations . Judo 's fundamental idea is easy to grasp , since every maneuver is built on a single principle : using he opponent 's weight against him -- If . " All you do in judo , " Mackey explains , " is demonstrate some of he things you learned about motion and balance in high-school physics . hen somebody throws a punch at you , his whole body moves forward . he connects , his forward motion ups and you go down . But suppose u duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop his momentum , the man is off-balance . Taking advantage of that split second helplessness , you floor him . very throw in judo is based on those two actions : break your man 's lance , then follow up by bringg him to the ground . " What sets judo apart from other stems of self-defense is its opengambit of " non-resistance. " is maneuver contains a built-in element of surprise , since no attacker expects an opponent to fight back by yielding . The very word Judo " is Japanese for " the art of giving way " ? or , as it is often called , rather misleadingly , " the gentle way . " Before you are permitted to try even the simplest throw , you must first learn how to fall . As much as 90 percent of body impact against the ground can be neutralized by a correctly executed fall . First you must relax your body completely , go absolutely limp . Then you are taught to strike the ground hard with outstretched arm and open palm at the exact moment that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of impact and cushions the shock . Training to take a fall is child 's play compared with learning throws . Even the most elementary " trick " ( judo 's word for throw or hold ) consists of several separate actions that must become literally reflex . O-soto-gari , usually the first trick taught , is nothing more than a refinement of tripping . But its execution involves five individual movements of the arms , legs , feet and trunk , carried out in less than one tenth the time it took you to read this sentence . Only endless practice will enable you to achieve this kind of speed and clockwork precision . " This is when students begin to realize that judo is n't some kind of magic they can pick up overnight , " says Mackey . " Artur Rubinstein never stops his keyboard exercises , and Floyd Patterson works out every day on a punching bag . You 've got to do the same thing in judo . " There 's mat work , too , in which  | you study the many ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground . " Do n't forget , " an American instructor warns , " if you dump a man , he 's not going to sit there and applaud . " Mat techniques range from simple arm or body locks to strangleholds , called " sleepers . " Like throws , they are learned by repetition of the separate movements . As familiarity with mechanics grows , an increasing amount of time is spent on randori ? informal competition aimed at wearing you out completely , so that you must rely on skill rather than physical strength . In these hard-smashing bouts , the tedium of rote pays dividends in lightning-fast throws and holds ? and occasional bruises . If judo techniques are practically foolproof against serious injury , the sport is made-to-order for sprained knees , twisted elbows , purple ankles , swollen toes and other inconsequential but sometimes painful damage . A knee or ankle bandage is almost a badge of honor in a dojo . But this minor battering is a small price to pay for the instructor 's shout of " Ippon ! " ? signifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shiai , a formal match conducted periodically to determine the progress of all pupils . Promotions are given , with colored belts awarded to designate the different degrees of skill . Beginners wear white belts , rise successively through yellow , orange , green , blue and brown black ? the sequence and colors vary somewhat in different d Four classes a week for six mu should qualify an adult for green belt , signifying a high class of competence with three or throws . The advance from green to brown , a big step , can be ma a year on the same schedul candidate for the black belt ? it Ph.D. ? must generally study four years ; and once he has gained this coveted rank , he finds hi a novice again , at the bottom of a ten-rank hierarchy ? a so-c " first dan . " " The way they It it in Japan , " says Mackey , hi a third dan , " when you 've first dan , that means you 're ready begin learning something judo . " Judo is generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddhist monks , lives of quiet contemplation often disrupted by gangs of r bandits . The monks ' religion bade aggression , but did n't rul self-defense ? which soon too form of primitive but potent niques of tripping and thro Innumerable refinements evolved over the centuries , reaching a in 1882 , when a nobleman n Jigoro Kano systematized the accumulation of tricks into a se fense method he called judo . Theodore Roosevelt worked regularly at the White House a protege of Count Kano , gained an exceptional degree of JUDO : MAYHEM WITH A GENTLE TOUCH 141  | skill . But the sport did n't really catch on in the United States until after World War II , when U.S. occupation troops in Japan , intrigued with judo 's vigor and speed , brought it home . The art is highly useful in any calling where physical violence is occupational hazard . Attendants in mental hospitals can restrain violent patients with firm but harmless " come-along " holds .

Many women are also ling up these days to learn how defend themselves . There 's no special age limit for judo . Kyuzo Mifune , one of the great judo men of all time , was active until his recent death at 8i . Joe Speyer , 58 , is a fourth dan and president of the New York Judo Black Belt Association . Judo can be a real tonic for businessmen who have let themselves get out of shape , Speyer believes . " I 'd recommend it over tennis or golf , " he says . " When you work out at a dojo , you exercise all your muscles , not just a few . You also learn to breathe deeply , and that 's important . " For judo experts , by far the most important asset of the " gentle way " is the personal inner assurance it brings . " If you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of physical attack with a conditioned reflex , " says Mackey , " you get a sense of inner security that spills over into the rest of your daily life . This can make a boy feel like a man , a man feel like a king . " r
