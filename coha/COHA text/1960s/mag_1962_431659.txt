e  |p531  Sapsucker Woods : Cornell University 's Exciting New Bird Sanctuary ONE CAN NOT OVERESTIMATE the farreaching results of an article in the National Georgraphic . Certainly I could never have guessed that my account of " Duck Hunting With a Color Camera , " in the October , 1951 , issue , would lead to the creation of a new bird sanctuary and thereby change my whole manner of living . Still less likely would have seemed the establishment of the first research laboratory in the Nation for the study of bird , behavior . But the ways of fortune are roundabout . Six months after publication of my duck story , I received a letter from a total stranger . The article , he said , had appealed to him so strongly that he went hunting with a color camera himself . He had tried his luck with a woodpecker . It took him two weeks to get the photograph , and when it came back from processing , he could n't find the woodpecker in the picture . This led to a pleasant correspondence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation in Arizona with the Lyman K. Stuarts and show them how to take bird photographs .

Lyman Stu a member of the Cornell University class 1921 , asked me whether I had some faro project at the university in which he cou help . I told him about a cool woodland so three miles from the Cornell campus . In l909 the great bird artist Louis Agassiz Fuert and I had named this unspoiled wildernSapsucker Woods , after the yellow-belli sapsucker nesting there ( page 548 ) . We h dreamed of preserving it as a bird sanctua but by now many of the great oaks and he locks had been felled for timber . Highway housing developments were coming closer .  |p533  " Cornell shall have it , " Lyman said , and ith his aunt , Mrs. Edith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29 ire . Around the tract , Lyman built a threeile chain-link fence . Then , with help from e State Conservation Department , we conucted a 1,500-foot dike to flood a field and e acres of woodland . The result was a tenre pond , ideal for wood ducks , herons , and own creepers . " What 's the next project ? " Lyman asked . " I dream of a low ranch-type building with broad windows overlooking the pond , " I replied , " with laboratories , a sound-recording room , a photographic workroom , and an aviary , for research in bird behavior . " Now we have exactly that . The Arcadia Foundation , a philanthropic organization founded by Lyman and four of his associates , donated the money for our Laboratory of Ornithology , the finest in the country . Do Grebes " Fly " Underwater ? Here we have already solved numerous riddles of bird life . For example : When grebes or loons or mergansers dive , do they use their wings underwater ? Can they swallow their catch without surfacing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass-fronted tank . Now we have watched the horned grebe swallowing minnows underwater . He chases them without moving his wings at all , relying on the lobes on toes ( page 541 ) . Redhead ducks , on the other hand , unlimber their wings underwater when they need a little more speed than they can get from their large webbed feet . As for me , for nine hours a day I sit in a combination office and bird blind . From my window I have seen 153 different kinds of birds ? everything from loons to sparrows including songbirds , birds of prey , ga birds , shore birds , wading birds , and wat fowl . It may well be that through this window more different kinds of birds have be seen than through any other . The pond , beginning barely twenty-five feet from my chair , is studded with du ( of many species and with blue , snow , a Canada geese .

Speakers Bring Bird Songs Indoors Our most unusual room is the observatory . here three plate-glass windows , each ten ? t long , present an intimate view of everanging beauty . Two microphones under eaves bring indoors all the songs and calls of the birds by day and the calls of the gs and toads by night , as if no glass interned .

A few of the waterfowl are pinioned ? that is , we remove from one wing the bone with the longest flight feathers . After that the bird is unable to fly . Such birds serve as decoys to show the newcomers where the food is . During the migratory seasons some pintails , teals , and baldpates may stay an hour or a day . Mergansers , finding plenty of minnows because we stock thy " pond well , may stay a week . Some black ducks and mallards , and occasionally wood ducks , stay all year round . The cracked corn never runs out , and in winter an electric agitator keeps a hole open in the ice so the birds can drink . Once , when the wintering flocks reached nearly 500 black ducks and mallards and the temperature dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger than a drinking fountain . Our refuge manager , my son David G. Allen , had to enlarge it often . Each year we look forward to the middle : . , ( , of June . The pond is rejuvenated then by many families of goslings and ducklings , after - having been deserted for weeks while the females were incubating . The little flotillas are most conspicuous during early mornings and evenings ( preceding page ) . However , a new wood duck family is likely to show up almost any time of day . As we count the little postder puffs , we are not always certain to which mother they belong . Trails Lead Visitors Through Woods Despite predators and disease , some families survive remarkably well . Last year a female wood duck brought 16 youngsters to the feeding area when they were only a few days old . We watched all 16 grow from their downy nestling plumage , through juvenile feathers , into brilliant winter attire .

We have built plank catwalks over the water , so that visitors can penrate dryshod into areas Tennyson might have described as the " haunts of coot and : tern " ( page 550 ) .

Some years the drumming log is silent . A tragedy has occurred during the winter , and the log will be silent until another grouse moves in ( page 549 ) . We usually blame the horned owls , but we prefer to let nature take its course , so we do not kill predators unless absolutely necessary . @# @#  | When a Cooper 's hawk refuses : a take suggestions and hangs arou the aviary , frightening the birds , n have to remove him .

Visitors Flock to Observatory The windows and the walks of Sapsucker Woods are here for all to enjoy : since the dedication of the laboratory in 1957 more than 30,000 visitors , from every State and 70 foreign countries , have signed our guestbook . So overwhelming is the view that a hush falls over even the noisiest children . Behind the scenes , however , other projects require privacy . This is because the laboratory is primarily a research institution , a place for the undisturbed asking of questions . We are curious about what birds do . but what interests us even more is why they do it , and how their patterns of behavior have evolved . This is the orientation of our research program . headed by a brilliant former student of mine , Dr. William C. Dilger . As research director , he supervises 18 graduate students , postdoctoral fellows . and research associates . " We do this work because we like it , " he says , " but underlying it all , like a conscience , is an awareness that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance of behavior . To understand complex human behavior. we should first investigate the simpler behavior of animals ? how they cope with hunger , sex urges , anger , frustration , and fear . " For such studies , birds make excellent subjects , often preferable to mammals . Though we may feel we understand mammals better , they respond strongly to sounds we can not hear and to smells we can not notice . Birds see more as we see and hear more as we hear . As we observe birds , we get a better idea of exactly what they are reacting to than we can with mammals . Dr. Dilger himself has shown how frustrations arise in the bird world , as readily as in the human species , when  |p541  a bird inherits the drive to do something but not the ability to do it . To prove the point , Dr. Dilger crossbred different species of African lovebirds . Feles of all these species cut narrow strips bark or leaves for nest building . In captivity , they will cut strips from wrapping paper stead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their manner of flying the strips to the nest site . Some carry ? ith their bills , while others tuck one end of ch strip under feathers of the body and fly home with perhaps a dozen strips trailing like streamers . Aware of these differences , Dr. Dilger wondered : What happens when " nontuckers " are mated to " tuckers " ? The hybrids inherit the urge to tuck but not the ability to hold . They may cut and tuck for twenty minutes without understanding that their feathers can not hold the strips . Finally they carry off a single strip in the bill , but when they return , they try to tuck again and again without success . Over a period of years , however , they gradually learn to carry the strips in their bills and virtually abandon the tucking . Young Birds Reared in Soundless World Jim Hartshorne , one of our graduate students , applied his ingenuity to the songs of birds . He concerned himself with the basic call notes , such as distress calls and begging cries , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primary , or true , song , which the male sings to attract females and to challenge other males near his territory . Are the call notes and true song inher/ ited , he wondered , or must they be learned ? To find out , Jim designed the Hartshorne Sound-Isolation Chamber ( above ) , so that he could raise pairs of bluebirds from the egg up without ever letting them hear sounds from the outside world ? not even the calls or song of their own parents ! The experiment made Jim a nursemaid to his motherless charges . For days he watched a birdhouse nest through a one-way window to see what bluebird parents dish up . He saw them bring a variety of insects , from flies to praying mantises ? fare that he could not easily provide in quantity . So he perfected his own formula : cottage cheese plus fruit , vitamins , and antibiotics , mixed with earthworms and chick starter in an electric blender and fed with a tiny syringe . Jim kept some of the birds completely isolated for six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he played recordings of the songs of the robin , the Baltimore oriole , and the wood thrush . The young bluebirds showed little interest . Next he played the bluebird song ? but in reverse . Even though the young birds had never before heard such a sound , they perked up a little . Finally he played the bluebird infrared light , i en through an electr . a barn owl listens a mouse he will catch ass .

The laboratory is the home of the Cornell Library of Natural Sounds , an extensive collection of recordings , primarily of birds . Duplicates on tape are mailed on request to investigators all over the world . The early impetus for this work came from the late Albert Brand who , at 39 , sold his seat on the New York Stock Exchange to devote the rest of his life to something he found more nit , P PAEUU interesting ? namely , bird study at Cornell . He noted that the verbal descriptions of bird song are more fanciful than adequate . Bird guidebooks say that the black-throated green warbler gives " a lisping , dreamy zoo-zee-zoozoo-zee , " or that the Traill 's flycatcher has " an explosive weeps-a-pi-deea . " Ambushing Birds With a Recorder Brand decided that there ought to be some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the project . Using the system he developed , we did exciting work , notably recording the ivory-billed woodpecker , the rarest North American bird . We found a pair nesting in Louisiana , 43 feet off the ground in a dead swamp maple . Today there may be only one or two pairs left. * Later we also recorded the kerloo ! ker-leeoo ! of the second rarest bird , the whooping crane , in Texas ; and the brassy bugle of the fourth rarest , the trumpeter swan , in Montana . We had no luck with the California condor , which ranks third in rarity . After struggling to a nest and much watching and waiting , we saw condors but heard no sound . In the early days our recording equipment weighed half a ton and required a special truck . Today better recordings are secured with tape recorders weighing less than twenty pounds . Albert Brand 's name , however , should be honored with those of naturalistauthor Frank M. Chapman and photographer George Shiras , 3d , who popularized use of the binocular and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the bird we are trying to tape . We record him as best we can , and play his notes back immediately , over a small loudspeaker . The bird will usually suspect a rival and show up at once to defend his territory . In fact , he may try to get right into the speaker . Then we not only see him , but we obtain a much better recording . Thanks to this technique and up-to-date equipment , dedicated people without professional training are making substantial contributions to ornithology . We have appointed several of them research associates . An example is Myles North , who lives in Kenya and whose numerous recordings include the black-throated honey-guide and the whitebellied go-away bird . Definitive analysis of bird notes thus collected in many parts of the world is now possible through the audiospectrograph . I will  |p547  let Dr. Peter Paul Kellogg ? Professor of Ornithology and Biological Acoustics , and an assistant director of the laboratory ? explain how it works . " Most bird songs are less than two seconds long , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores of times , while various filters permit only selected frequenes to come through . " On each playing , a stylus makes a graph of the sound on a paper-covered drum . The finished picture , called the audiospectrogram , represents a diagram of the entire bird song . All the overtones are shown . All the notes are unscrambled . " We have found birds that sing two notes at the same time , and some may sing three . " Bird Songs Help Support Laboratory There are about 8,600 bird species in the world , and we have recordings of 1,250 of them . Many are available to the public on long-playing records . Songbirds of . : America is especially popular , and also Bird Songs in Your Garden. * Some people use the records to attract birds closer to their windows ? for birds that set up territories in gardens are quick to respond to imagined rivals . Unlike most departments of the university , the Laboratory of Ornithology is self-supporting , and if it were not for gifts from friends and the phonograph record royalties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our research staff . Let 's look in once more on Bill Dilger and his African lovebirds . Since we can not tell their sex simply by looking at them , he may be operating on some young birds to make sure ( page 540 ) . Then he will band and log them . For convenience , they also are given names ? Ted and Lois , or Robert and Laurie . Bill 's routine is to watch what goes on in the cages , day by day . He dictates what he sees into a tape recorder , so that he wo n't have to take his eyes off the birds . When Lois cuts a strip of paper for her nest , does she cut to the right or left ? How long are her strips ? And so on , in great detail , for weeks and months . Machines tabulate the massive records . Then we can ask fruitful questions . For instance : When a lovebird drops a strip , does she pick it up again ? Or does she cut another strip ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will pick up a dropped strip . Others , that tuck strips into their rump feathers , usually cut a new one . Thus we discover that the species that carries strips in the bill , being less wasteful , represents a more advanced behavior type . Birds may be classified as belonging to a simple species or to one more complex in behavior , as reflected in the females ' choice of nesting material : Stage I. Short pieces , that can be carried stuck into feathers all over her body but can be made only into a simple pad . Stage II . Long strips , carried in the rump feathers , that @#  |p550  can be woven into a round , cuplike nest . Stage III . The bird builds a roof and therefore needs stronger materials , namely twigs , which can be carried only in the bill . Now , after a little detective work , we say that the lovebird species of Madagascar ( Stage I ) are more primitive than those of Angola ( Stage II ) , and that the most advanced species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can even predict some female lovebird behavior of the future : Stage IV probably will carry not one but several twigs in her bill . Parrot 's " Aggression " Mostly Bluff Once a week Bill and the research staff meet in the observatory and discuss experiments and new findings in related sciences . They talk of " survival value , " " fear thresholds , " " redirected aggression . " It is fascinating , and not nearly so forbidding as it sounds . Imagine parrot A stalking fiercely toward parrot B. That 's aggression . Parrot B does n't give ground , and bird A becomes frightened . He has reached his fear threshold . Bird A flies off to a high perch and pecks fiercely at the perch . That 's redirected aggression . Other birds , such as pigeons , fight frequently but are not equipped to harm each other much . The parrots , however , carry extremely powerful bills . The behavior described above ? bluffing rather than fighting ? keeps them from tearing each other to pieces . Therefore this behavior pattern has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded with bird lovers from all walk of life : professors , students , doctors , lawyers . and businessmen , many from neighboring towns . They hear lectures , perhaps from our new director , Dr. Olin Sewall Pettingill , Jr. , on his study of penguins in the Falkland Islands. * or from our executive secretary , Dr. Sally Foresman Hoyt , on talking birds . Recently @#  |p551  we ran a unique film about the bald eagle , produced by Bayard Read of our Advisory Council under the auspices of the Cornell laboratory and distributed by the National Audubon Society . At the start of the program , I customarily tall " the roll of the birds " ? reading the list of all 300 species that have ever been seen in the Cayuga Lake Basin and checking off those reported . Thus we take an informal census of the birds seen each week throughout the year . The information provides interesting material for our Saturday morning radio talks , as well as a permanent file of the birds occurring in central New York State . Sanctuary Combines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insists on driving the bugs out of the microphone at the turner of the building . The sound is like an air hammer . Now it stops , and I turn to see the rosy clouds deepen to lavender . The trees are starkly silhouetted . A flock of mallards sets its wings to land on the freshly frozen pond . Some slide five feet , some twenty . I never tire of watching ducks ? so graceful in the water and in the air , so clumsy on the land they were n't made for , so cheerfully flatfooted on the ice . I shall watch them until it is quite dark . This is the story of Sapsucker Woods and the Laboratory of Ornithology at Cornell University , a rare combination of science and art , of research and popular education ? where the professional and the layman work side by side to produce a place of charm and relaxation , as well as of study and discovery . It is our hope that similar projects will spring up the country over to attest the value of natural areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wild birds relax the mind and enrich the spirit .
