The scene is a basement apartment in Greenwich Village in the late Twenties . The time of day is late afternoon . There is an air of disorder about the apartment . An unmade studio couch is at Left against the wall . There are a few chairs helter-skelter . Two windows , barred , are cut out of the wall up Right and Left , and between the windows , a kitchen sink and gas stove , not part of a unit . Above the sink and stove , two shelves on which rest utensils and cups , saucers , and dishes , which are not part of a set . There is an open coffee can . On the window-sill at Left , a half-empty milk bottle , and beside it a half-consumed loaf of bread . The entrance to the apartment is through a door cut out of the wall up Right . Along that wall , a davenport with a couple of pillows . Down Right , another door is cut out of the wall , opening on to a bathroom . Hanging or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some unframed reproductions of Modigliani , Picasso , Kuniyoshi , Grant Wood , in no order or sense . Up Centre is a cheap office table on which is a typewriter , with a stack of paper still in the wrapping , although the wrapping has been torn open . Beside the paper is an empty coffee can , used as an ash tray . Beside the table , a cheap bridge lamp . On an end table beside the davenport rests a telephone . On a coffee table in front of the davenport , a half-empty gin bottle from a cordial shop . At rise a man is standing at the gas stove , making coffee . This man is named TOWNSEND RINGWALD . He is in his thirties . He is wearing grey flannel slacks that have not been pressed in weeks , a white Brooks shirt open at the neck , a pair of leather bedroom slippers . He has a pair of horn-rimmed glasses pushed back on the top of his head . He needs a shave . While the coffee is brewing he peers out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky to see what kind of day it is , but although there is a yard on the other side of the windows , the yard area is hemmed in by the neighbouring buildings , and it is an apartment that sees little daylight . RINGWALD , satisfied that the coffee is ready , pours himself a cup , puts in sugar and cream . He picks up the loaf of bread , but changes his mind about having a slice of it , and instead takes the coffee and sits at the table and lights a cigarette , smoking and sipping coffee as he reads the stuff that is still in the typewriter . He reads critically , becoming absorbed , and now properly seats himself at the typewriter and writes a few words rapidly . While he is so engaged there is a knock on the door . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Come in . The door is opened and a young woman in sweater and skirt enters . She carries no bag and is not attired for the street . Her name is VERONIQUE McCULLOUGH . p. 3 TOWNSEND RINGWALD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the epithet , but it does caricature her prettiness . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Hello  --  Horse Face . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Well , after this brisk exchange of compliments , what do you want ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I thought I could smell the coffee , so I thought I 'd drop in for a cup . TOWNSEND RINGWALD All right . Have a cup . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Were you working ? I do n't want to disturb you . TOWNSEND RINGWALD It 's nothing . I 'm just finishing up a review . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Who for ? Are you going to get paid for it ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD I 'll get six dollars . Maybe seven-fifty , if they do n't cut it . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Do you get to sign your name to it ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD No . It 's just a mystery story . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You do n't even get to sign your initials ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD No . There 's no glory . Only money . Six dollars , maybe seven and a half . p. 4 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You make your coffee so strong . TOWNSEND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , I like it this way . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You can keep the note of complaint out of your voice . Sit down . Have a cigarette . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I do n't want to disturb you . TOWNSEND RINGWALD That calls for several obvious remarks . I do n't think I 'll make them . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I worked today . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Did you ? At what ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Modelling , of course . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Did you get paid ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I certainly did . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Did you get paid a lot ? Enough to give me a little something on account ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I can give you some . But not the whole fifteen dollars . TOWNSEND RINGWALD The whole fifteen dollars is actually twenty-five dollars , Veronique . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , the other ten . That 's right . It is twenty-five.Well , I can give you five . p. 5 TOWNSEND RINGWALD All right . It helps . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I have n't got it with me , though . TOWNSEND RINGWALD That 's all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH All right , as soon as I finish my coffee and smoke a cigarette . May I use your phone ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD It 's been shut off . Temporarily disconnected . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH So 's mine . This building is full of disconnected phones . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Oh , it was n't the smell of my coffee that brought you here . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I did n't say it was the only thing . But when I smelt the coffee I knew you were in . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Who else 's phone is disconnected ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH The boys ' . TOWNSEND RINGWALD The boys let their phone get shut off ? What ever will they do ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I know . Earl says it 's a tragedy . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Well , for him I guess it is . When his window 's open I can hear him dishing all day . p. 6 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH How much do you owe ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD It is n't so much a question of how much I owe as how long I 've owed it . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're a bunch of crooks at the phone company . I get charged for calls I never made . I never called anybody in Idaho . I do n't know anybody in Idaho . Actually I 'm not even sure where Idaho is . I get Idaho mixed with Iowa . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Do n't they teach American geography in Canada ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH They teach it , but I do n't even know Canadian geography . Geography is just a big , boring waste of time . If you want to go some place , go to the railway station and buy a ticket . Let them worry about where it is , and how to get there . When I came to New York two years ago , I left Montreal at night and the next morning I was in New York . I do n't know what states I passed through and I do n't care . The engineer knew the way , that 's what he gets paid for . TOWNSEND RINGWALD That may be a very sensible way to look at it . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean . My family took me abroad when I was fourteen , and it 's even harder to know the way from Montreal to Liverpool , England . On the ocean there 's nobody to ask . At least if the engineer of a train gets lost he can ask at the next station . You see what I mean ? p. 7 TOWNSEND RINGWALD Yes , dear . Just put your trust in the man up front . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH That sounds religious . TOWNSEND RINGWALD It was meant to . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH But you 're not a Catholic . TOWNSEND RINGWALD No , I most certainly am not a Catholic . But you are , I suppose . I never thought to ask . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Devout . I do n't believe in some of the stuff , but I love my religion . I cry on Good Friday , but them I 'm so happy at Easter . When do you think you 'll have your phone connected again ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Search me , I do n't know . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Because I was thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? If I got my phone reconnected , you 'd put off having yours reconnected . As a matter of fact , Veronique , on my bill there are two long-distance calls to Montreal . I 've never called Montreal . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH There , just what I told you a minute ago . I never called Iowa , either . But I guess I did call Montreal on your phone . But I asked you if I could , and you said it was all right . You knew I came from Montreal . p. 8 TOWNSEND RINGWALD Yes , I did . But I did n't assume that whenever you used my phone you 'd call home . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Actually I did n't call home . I called a friend of mine that my parents do n't approve of . A man about your age , and married . You 're not married , are you , Townsend ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD I was , but I 'm not . I told you that . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Divorced . We ca n't get divorced , that 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . You can get married and if it does n't work out , you just get a divorce . But it 's against our religion . If it had n't been for that I probably would have been married three or four times by now . Oh , at least You do n't seem very cheerful today , Townsend . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Do I ever seem very cheerful ? I do n't think I ever radiate cheer . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH No , but sometimes you 're more cheerful than others . TOWNSEND RINGWALD That may be true . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , it is . I 've seen you when you had enough to drink and you were loads of fun . If you have a hangover , why do n't you take a drink ? You have some gin there , I see . TOWNSEND RINGWALD No hangover . p. 9 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I have n't got exactly a hangover , but it 's almost six o'clock and I have n't had a thing to drink all day . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Help yourself , but I have nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bitters ? You usually have a bottle of Angostura . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I guess there 's some Angostura there . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH There is , I can recognize the bottle from here . Townsend ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD What ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Let 's get just a little plastered ? Just enough to forget our troubles . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Too early , and I have a lot of work to do . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I thought you were finished . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I 've finished the review I was writing , but I have other work and I 'm way behind . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , your play . But you 've been working on that ever since I 've known you . I feel like getting just a little tight and then going over to Mario 's . I 'd love some spaghetti and red wine . How much do you owe Mario ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD About seventy-five or eighty dollars . p. 10 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH That 's all right , as long as it 's under a hundred . He told me . He said if you pay him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a hundred . But he does n't like it when people that owe him money stop coming in . He told me that . TOWNSEND RINGWALD He tells everybody that . But I have n't even got enough money for a tip . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I have . What do you tip ? A dollar ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD As a rule . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH That 's for two . Well , have you got fifty cents ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Just about . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , you can sign for the dinner and each of us leave fifty cents , that 's a dollar . Mario told me he does n't like people staying away because they owe him money . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You have a gin and Angostura . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Not alone . I do n't want to drink alone , Townsend.When a girl starts drinking alone , that 's one of the signs you have to look out for . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I do n't want a drink . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well do you mind if I have one ? That 's not really drinking alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go ahead . Help yourself . She pours gin and a dash of Angostura into a tumbler . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Cheerio , Townsend . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Cheery-ho , and votre sant . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Thank you , my dear . J'oublie toujours que vous parlez Franais . TOWNSEND RINGWALD J'oublie toujours que je parle Franais . In fact , a me fait du bien d'oublier que je parle Franais . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH No , I think it 's nice to hear French spoken in the States . Maybe some day you 'll all speak French . TOWNSEND RINGWALD When the Canadians take over . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , you were originally Canadians , in a way , were n't you ? Were n't you under the King , the same as we are ? And then you broke away . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You always have a fresh slant on things , Veronique . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I know , is n't it strange ? Because I did n't have much schooling . I was terrible in school . Terrible . But everybody says I have a good mind . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( reading the line differently ) : Nothing . I was just saying I have a good mind , too . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , yes . There 's no doubt about it . I can always tell your reviews , even without the initials . You have a flair , Townsend . You really have . There is a knock on the door . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( to RINGWALD ) : Who 's that ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD We 'll see . Come in ! A woman , thirtyish , in a good but not new suit , appears in the doorway . She is MARY LEONARD . MARY LEONARD Am I intruding ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Yes , but we 'll find a place for you . Miss Leonard , Miss McCullough . Mary , Veronique . MARY LEONARD Hello . Veronique McCullough . French and Scotch ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH French and Scotch-Irish . Canadian . MARY LEONARD A dismounted Canadian . Were you sent down to apprehend our friend here ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Yes , and she always gets her man , if that 's what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . Can I have some of that , whatever it is ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Help yourself . MARY LEONARD It must be awful , if you 're staying away from it . TOWNSEND RINGWALD It 's gin and bitters , and you 're familiar with it . Do you want a cigarette ? MARY LEONARD ( helping herself to gin without bitters ) : I have some , thanks . You 're a show girl , are n't you ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I have been . I 'm modelling now . MARY LEONARD You were in an Earl Carroll show . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , you remember me ? MARY LEONARD Yes , I do , and I 'm not a Les . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Since when ? MARY LEONARD Since you came into my life and showed me all that I was missing . How 's that for an answer ? Why are n't you drinking ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD It 's a good thing I 'm not , or there would n't be enough to go around . MARY LEONARD There is n't going to be anyway . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my agent . p. 14 MARY LEONARD Miss Leonard is your agent . You do n't make enough money to have Keith Singleton handle you personally . TOWNSEND RINGWALD What 's the cheque for ? MARY LEONARD For summer stock . Do you want me to tell the amount in front of our Canadian friend ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Sure . Impress her . MARY LEONARD Two hundred dollars less commission , less a hundred dollars borrowed from the office . Total , net , eighty dollars . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Just enough to pay Mario ! TOWNSEND RINGWALD You 're supposed to ask how I earned this magnificent windfall . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh . How did you ? MARY LEONARD He wrote a play once . It was called Perihelion , and they do it in summer stock because it only needs five actors and a lot of porch furniture . TOWNSEND RINGWALD And it was a good play . MARY LEONARD It was n't a bad play . And it was a comedy . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I heard of it . I did n't know you wrote it , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1922 . Unfortunately , he has n't written anything since . p. 15 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Why yes he has . MARY LEONARD Nothing that did n't close in Atlantic City . He went Greenwich Village on us . No more comedies . Eugene O'Neill . When I think of the money this man is passing up it makes me cry . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Let 's see you cry , Mary . MARY LEONARD ( over him ) : I would n't mind if he did n't like money , but he does . You should have seen him when Perihelion was a hit . A racing car , and a closetful of clothes  --  and an apartment full of girls . Parties , parties . And he could have it all again if he 'd write another comedy . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Then I think he 's entitled to a lot of credit . I thought he lived this way because he had to . MARY LEONARD Oh , he has to , but he would n't for long . And it is n't the honest way , you know . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not paying bills , when you have the ability to do something . It 's just stubbornness . Ever since he saw The Hairy Ape  --   --  TOWNSEND RINGWALD Anna Christie . MARY LEONARD No , it was The Hairy Ape that really did it to you . But we do n't have to argue that point . In fact , I do n't want to argue with you at all . I just want to tell this voluptuous young woman that you do n't have to live poor . p. 16 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH What are you telling me for ? MARY LEONARD ( looks pointedly at her figure ) : Because I assume that you have some influence . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Not so far . MARY LEONARD How long have you known each other ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I do n't know . About six months , I guess . Whenever I moved here . MARY LEONARD Here ? You live here ? ( She looks around for signs of a woman 's occupancy . ) VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Upstairs . MARY LEONARD ( genuinely baffled ) : Well  --  but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you have no influence ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Mary , what 's come over you ? This delicacy , this tact . Why do n't you come right out with it ? MARY LEONARD All right , I will . Do n't you and Townsend go to bed together ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , not always . MARY LEONARD Then you must have someone else . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , do n't act surprised . You did n't ask me that . p. 17 MARY LEONARD I see . Townsend is just a neighbour . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Sort of . MARY LEONARD And once in a while you bring him a nice cup of hot soup . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I guess you could put it that way . MARY LEONARD I do put it that way . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( no fool ) : The same way that  --  for instance you could have mailed him that cheque . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Score one for the Canadian team . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I was here first , but maybe I 'm the one that 's intruding , Miss Leonard . MARY LEONARD Believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not by about ten years . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , I 'm here now . MARY LEONARD So I see , but not having much influence . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I never tried to influence you , did I , Townsend ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Not in any way that affects my professional life . You do try to influence me , though . MARY LEONARD ( eager ) : How , for instance ? p. 18 TOWNSEND RINGWALD Well , just before you made your timely arrival , Veronique wanted me to get a little drunk with her . MARY LEONARD And you resisted her wiles ? Why ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Because I want to work on the fourth act of my play . MARY LEONARD That should be easy . Just cut it off . ( She makes a downward-with-cleaver gesture . ) TOWNSEND RINGWALD No , that 's the easy way , Mary . MARY LEONARD If I 'd been ten minutes later  --  no not ten minutes . You do n't get tight in ten minutes . If I 'd been a couple of hours later  --  TOWNSEND RINGWALD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEONARD Or not come at all , you and Miss Canada would be cementing relations . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I do n't know , but that 's extremely well put . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH When you love a person as much as I love Townsend you do n't have to cement relations . TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( amazed ) : This is a new one on me . As much as you love me , Veronique ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , I love you more than I love most people . p. 19 TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( relieved ) : Oh . MARY LEONARD That was quick . Bing  --  romance ! Bang  --  friendship ! Do n't you wish they were all over as quickly as that ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Sometimes they are , but I do n't always catch on . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I have the rest of a bottle of gin upstairs . MARY LEONARD Get it . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I might as well , do n't you think ? We 'll need it . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Why do you think we 'll need it ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Because are n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't going to leave you with me , and I 'm certainly not going to leave you with her . MARY LEONARD If we all get enough gin in us nobody 'll have to leave . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Are you planning something ? MARY LEONARD I 'm not planning anything , but you never can tell . You get the gin . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I 'll only be a minute . MARY LEONARD That wo n't give us much time . p. 20 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH No it wo n't , will it ? ( She exits . ) MARY LEONARD She 's no fool . TOWNSEND RINGWALD No . MARY LEONARD Well , but she 's so quick . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You helped her out a little . You started out by saying you were n't a Les . MARY LEONARD I had to . I could tell it was what she was thinking . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Maybe you had a glint in your eye . MARY LEONARD Maybe I did . Well , she does n't seem shocked . TOWNSEND RINGWALD She is n't shocked . She 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of innocent . MARY LEONARD I 've heard that before . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I do n't claim it as an original remark . Just a comment on Veronique 's morals . MARY LEONARD Well , I guess you learn fast in an Earl Carroll show . And she was beautiful , absolutely beautiful . Somebody taught her to look out over the audience . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Nobody taught her anything . She was born knowing those things . p. 21 MARY LEONARD But what 's she doing living in a dump like this ? Is she by any chance really in love with you ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Hell , no . MARY LEONARD Well then , what 's she doing here when she could be living on Central Park West ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD That 's exactly where she did live for a while . MARY LEONARD A lot of those girls get the idea that they can paint . Can she paint ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD No . And she has n't any money beyond what she gets modelling . Her phone is turned off , for instance . MARY LEONARD So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . It 's been off for over a week . MARY LEONARD Do you want me to go home ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD That depends . MARY LEONARD On her ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD On you . MARY LEONARD Why ? If it does n't mean anything to her , if she 's so damn sophisticated that she 's sort of innocent . Are you getting protective , Townsend ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD She can take care of herself . p. 22 MARY LEONARD Then let her . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You know , Mary , you 're absolutely corrupt . You came down here to get laid , but as soon as you saw her , you have other schemes . MARY LEONARD If you 'd pay your phone bill you could avoid such complications . TOWNSEND RINGWALD If I wrote the kind of crap you want me to write I could have a butler to answer my phone . And I could be swimming in the blue Mediterranean . And I 'd have Veronique with me , at least for a couple of weeks . MARY LEONARD And that 's what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and girls like Veronique for a couple of weeks . This is the real crap , Townsend . This filthy place . Unpaid phone bills . Scrabbling for eighty dollars and writing nasty little five-dollar book reviews . You 're stubborn . You 're in over your depth . That 's really it . You 're in over your depth . You 'll never be O'Neill or anywhere near him . Your whole scheme is based on envy of better writers than you are . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Enjoy yourself . MARY LEONARD I intend to . You live in this dump , writing unproducible bad plays , and you keep telling yourself that you 're an artist . You 're not . You 're an envious , jealous coward , not an artist . You can go on for the rest of your life , living from hand to mouth and telling yourself how artistic you are . But all that time you 're a yellow coward , because you wo n't admit to your own limitations . You 're an extremely competent hack , putting on artistic airs. p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And loving it . This five-act play , for God 's sake . I suppose you read in the paper that Eugene O'Neill is writing a five-act play . Of course you did . But his will be out before yours will . And his will be good . Philip Barry has two hits , comedies , and that 's another reason why you 're a coward . You 're afraid a comedy by you wo n't be as successful as Barry 's comedies , and you would n't be able to stand that , would you ? You had a hit before Barry had a hit , and now he 's nudged you out of the way . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I 'm not conscious of being nudged by anybody . Except you , Mary . You want me to give up what I 'm doing , for which I 've already given up a great deal . And the thing that inspired this outburst , you want me to give up Veronique McCullough so that you can have her . MARY LEONARD You had to say that , did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you and your work is true , but you can sweep it all under the rug because I am what I am . Dear of you , Townsend . Well , I did n't always know that I was bi-sexual . You can take some credit for that , if you like . ( She rises and exits angrily , sadly . ) CURTAIN p. 24 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO Same as Scene One . The next day . TOWNSEND RINGWALD , attired as before , is pouring coffee . He takes a sip , and while he is doing so the telephone rings . He does a slow take of surprise as he realises that the phone is on again . At the sound of the telephone bell , VERONIQUE , on the studio couch , attired in a pair of RINGWALD 's pyjamas , wakes up and slowly brings herself up on her elbows as RINGWALD goes to the phone . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Hello . Oh , hello , Mary . First I want to ask you something . Did you have the phone service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that 's probably a good idea . What 's on your mind now ? I do n't know . How much can you get for it ? That seems like a lot of money , do you think they 'll pay it ? I do n't know , Mary . I leave those things for you to decide . You and your boss Mr. Singleton . Is this important enough for Singleton ? His personal attention ? Well , get all you can , because obviously from your remarks yesterday you never expect to get any more . That is exactly ( looking over at VERONIQUE ) none of your business . You might try having her phone service restored . Good-bye . ( Hangs up . ) Do you want some coffee ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I 'd like a cup of coffee . p. 25 TOWNSEND RINGWALD Piece of toast ? I have no butter , but you can have some strawberry jam . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH All right . ( She studies him , waiting for him to disclose the details of the telephone call . He is making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting her coffee , etc . ) TOWNSEND RINGWALD The agency paid my phone bill . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You must be getting valuable again . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I 'm not so sure about that . After our fight yesterday Mary decided it 'd be better to communicate by phone instead of coming down here . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH What did she want to know about me ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Wanted to know if you were here . I told her it was none of her business . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I do n't care if she knows . I did n't keep it secret yesterday . TOWNSEND RINGWALD It 's still none of her business . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH What else did she have to say ? What seemed like a lot of money ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD A movie company wants to buy the rights to my play . p. 26 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Perihelion ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD The only one they ever heard of , yes . They think it would make a picture for Ann Harding . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , boy . Then they 'll pay a lot for it . TOWNSEND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell me how much ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD They 're offering fifteen thousand . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH They 'll go to twenty-five . TOWNSEND RINGWALD That 's what Mary thinks . God , twenty-five thousand , less twenty-five hundred commission . Twenty-two thousand five hundred dollars . I have n't had that much money since 1922 . I have n't got it yet , but you 're probably right , you and Mary . I have a feeling they 'll buy it and pay twenty-five thousand . And Mary said she can get me a job writing the scenario , five hundred a week with a three months ' guarantee . Twelve times five hundred . Six thousand dollars . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH When would you leave ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD I 'm not going to leave . I 'll sell the movie rights , but I wo n't go to Hollywood . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Not even if they offered you a thousand a week ? p. 27 TOWNSEND RINGWALD I was offered a thousand a week a few years ago , to go out and write subtitles . I turned it down then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgets that I gave things up in order to write what I wanted to write . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I wish I could have been here when you were having your fight . She got under your skin , did n't she ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD She always can . She knows all my soft spots . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I did n't know you had any . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I do n't know how you can say that . I 'm just a big pan of mush where you 're concerned . You can twist me around your little finger . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Hah ! He sits on the edge of her bed as she sips coffee . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Why do you live in the Village ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Why do I live in the Village ? Why do you live in the Village ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Because for me it 's one step above a flophouse on the Bowery . The Bowery is better suited to my income , but I could n't have a typewriter there , and I could n't have privacy in a flop-house . This lousy dump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much better . p. 28 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You mean being kept , uptown ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Yes . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You 're a writer . Did you ever stop to think of what it means , being kept ? It does n't only mean somebody 's keeping you in the lap of luxury . They 're also keeping you from doing what you want to do . A man does n't just give you a fur coat and pay your rent to go to bed with you . They want to know where you are all the time , who you 're with . And a woman is just as bad if not worse . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You 've been kept by a woman ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH For a couple of weeks . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Who ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( shaking her head ) : Do n't ask me to mention any names . Anyway , you would n't know her . She was n't in show business . She did n't exactly keep me . She got me to live with her while her parents were abroad . TOWNSEND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sent me flowers to the theatre , just initials on the card . I thought it was a man till I found out otherwise . TOWNSEND RINGWALD A dyke , huh ? But you 've been around , you knew what to expect . Did you like her ? You must have . p. 29 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH She was good-looking . At first I thought she wanted me for her boy friend . I had that happen to me . But she wanted me for herself , and believe me , nobody else . No other man , woman or child . She would n't even let the maid bring me my breakfast in the morning , and every night we went out with the same two pansies . We 'd go to Tony 's and Harlem . Oh , did they ever know her in Harlem ! TOWNSEND RINGWALD If I tell you her initials will you tell me if I 'm right ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes . TOWNSEND RINGWALD A. W. VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , you know her ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Of course . Have you seen her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's gotten fat and very mannish . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH No , I have n't seen her . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Is that why you live here ? To get away from people like her ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH If you mean Lesses , there are plenty of them down here . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I know that . No , I meant people that keep you . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I 'd let you keep me if you had the money . It 's hard to say why I live here . I came to New York to get away from Montreal and my parents , but they 're just as strict uptown , only in a different way . Here at least you do n't have to take orders from anybody . p. 30 TOWNSEND RINGWALD Now we 're getting somewhere . You live here because you want to be your own boss . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes , but even that 's not the whole thing . That does n't quite express it . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Then I 'll try another way . Independence . What everybody comes here for . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get awfully lonesome being independent . But I 'm not lonesome here , very often . I can come in and see you . And the queers , Wilmer and Earl . They 're always good for laughs  --  when they 're not fighting with each other . TOWNSEND RINGWALD But you do n't miss having pretty clothes and all that ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , if I want them I know how I can get them . If I want them bad enough . TOWNSEND RINGWALD And money ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Money is part of that . I would n't know what else to do with money except spend it on clothes and stuff . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Where does marriage fit in with your plans , or does it ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well  --  I told you I have to be sure . And I wo n't marry a man that asks too many questions . p. 31 TOWNSEND RINGWALD That lets me out . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , you and I would never marry each other . And I do n't mind you asking questions . You ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out all about me so they could throw it up to me later on . TOWNSEND RINGWALD By the sound of that I would guess that someone has done that . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes . A young fellow . He got me to tell him everything about myself , I did n't hardly hold back a thing . And after that he made my life miserable . So it does n't pay to answer a lot of questions . He can take you for what you are , what he sees with his two eyes . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Every man is going to ask you questions , Veronique . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH So it seems . But when I tell them something I do n't want them to hold it against me . I do n't ask them anything . Of course men tell you without you asking them . With one exception . TOWNSEND RINGWALD And who 's the one exception ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You . You never volunteer any information about yourself . I always have to ask you . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Do you like that , or do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or I do n't dislike it . It 's just your way . We all have different ways . That 's what makes us different people . Maybe you like something in one person that you do n't like in someone else . ( She stops to listen to the sound of angry voices . ) Wilmer and Earl . Just listen to them . Wilmer 's going to walk out on Earl . p. 32 TOWNSEND RINGWALD He 's threatened to do that before . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes , but this time he 's serious . He told me . Earl is drinking too much and Wilmer says he is n't going to put up with much more . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I 've heard that before , only the last time Earl was complaining about Wilmer . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH But this is different . Earl 's been on a bender , has n't worked for two or three weeks , and he stole some money from Wilmer . ( There are more angry cries from above . ) Listen to them . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Has Wilmer got a job ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano in a speakeasy . But Earl 's been on this bender and stole some money from Wilmer , and then the other night Wilmer came home and Earl had taken two of his suits and hocked them . New suits , worth seventy dollars apiece , and Earl hocked them for twenty dollars . I do n't blame Wilmer for being cross . He needs wardrobe in his work . ( The door bursts open . ) Hello , Wilmer . WILMER a slight man in his thirties , wearing shirt and trousers , stares at them . WILMER HIGHTOWER ( tearfully ) : Look what he did to me , that bitch . He scratched my face . p. 33 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Gee , he did . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Here , let me put something on it . WILMER HIGHTOWER No iodine ! I do n't want to look like an Indian . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I have some peroxide . WILMER HIGHTOWER I 'm going to have him arrested . He stole my watch that was left to me by my father . My gold watch . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy with peroxide ) : He really gouged you . WILMER HIGHTOWER Those long nails , the drunken bitch . How am I going to work tonight ? I 'll lose my job . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Maybe Veronique can cover it up with make-up . WILMER HIGHTOWER I 'll get an infection and die of blood poisoning . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Go to Stein 's on Sixth Avenue , they know how to make you up so it wo n't show . WILMER HIGHTOWER Even if I perspire ? I perspire by the time I finish a set . You know I play forty-five minutes uninterrupted . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Explain that at the drug store . WILMER HIGHTOWER Tomorrow how am I going to shave ? He 's ruined my face , the thieving bitch . I could kill him . Townsend , could I trouble you for a drink to steady my nerves ? p. 34 TOWNSEND RINGWALD There 's some gin . WILMER HIGHTOWER Anything . I do n't care what it is , just so it 's strong . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH But do n't get tight , Wilmer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my money and everything he could hock . If I lose my job I 'll starve to death , literally . ( He looks at them craftily , and lowers his voice . ) No I wo n't . I have some money saved up that he did n't know about . In the bank . He thinks he 's so smart , stealing my father 's watch and all . But wait till I blossom forth in a new wardrobe . It 'll kill him , and especially when I tell him what I was saving up for . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Christmas ? WILMER HIGHTOWER Oh , hell , no . No , I was going to take him on a trip to Bermuda . He 's been dying to go to Bermuda . I know why , too . He met a sailor boy from some British ship that 's stationed in Bermuda . But now I 'm going to spend every cent of that money on myself . Would n't you if you were me ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Absolutely , Wilmer . But when are you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIGHTOWER Quin sabe ? He 'll come crawling back on his hands and knees , begging my forgiveness. p. 35 TOWNSEND RINGWALD And you 'll take him back ? WILMER HIGHTOWER Oh , sure . He 's so young . But I 'm going to teach him a lesson , do n't you think I 'm not . He 's only twenty-three years of age , ten years my junior . Is this Mario 's gin ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Yes . WILMER HIGHTOWER I thought it was . I wonder what proportions he uses . I ca n't get my gin to taste as good as this . Veronique , you always ought to wear boys ' pyjamas . There 's something very appealing . Those silly fronts of yours in boys ' pyjamas . Townsend probably does n't think so , he 's such an old norm . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I think she 's very appealing . WILMER HIGHTOWER Yes , but we look at it different . To me she 's hilarious , with those fronts . Oh , I 'm beginning to feel human again . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to kill somebody . I could have stabbed him , the thieving little bitch . Can I have one of your Chesterfields , Townsend ? Are you still working on your play ? I hope it 's a big , big success . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Thank you , Wilmer . WILMER HIGHTOWER Did you know that Eugene O'Neill lived not far from here ? I think he lived in either forty-three , or forty-five , or forty-seven . At least that 's what I was told . You know who I mean , of course . Eugene O'Neill , the playwright . They could be lying , though . Every damn little hole in the wall they say some famous person used to live there . It 's supposed to make it more romantic . Personally I hate the Village , but there 's one thing I hate worse and that 's paying a lot of money for rent . What do you pay , Townsend ? Twenty-five ? Thirty ? p. 36 TOWNSEND RINGWALD Thirty . WILMER HIGHTOWER I pay fifty , but I have the two rooms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One thing you got to give Earl , he can do wonders with a few cans of paint and a few yards of material . He has such imagination and taste , if you know what I mean . But he just will not hold a job . He no sooner gets a job than he starts criticizing . That 's puke , he 'll say . He said it to some of the most famous decorators in the profession . That 's puke . Well , no wonder he ca n't hold a job . But you 're going to hear from him . He has talent , that boy . Ask Veronique . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH He has . WILMER HIGHTOWER Everybody that sees our apartment wants to get Earl to do theirs . And all the training he ever had was one year at Carnegie Tech . He told them it was puke , too , what they were teaching . And you wonder where he gets it from . His parents are common as dirt . The father works in a steel mill , and the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother gave music lessons , and I could play the violin when I was six years of age . Piano when I was seven , before I could span an octave . I wish I could let my nails grow , but I ca n't . Well , kids , thanks for coming to my rescue . Stein 's on Sixth Avenue , Veronique ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Corner of 47th and Sixth . p. 37 WILMER HIGHTOWER You 're very sweet , the two of you . Real sweet . He exits bouncing . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I hope Earl did n't hear all that . TOWNSEND RINGWALD How could he ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , do you know where I bet he is right this minute ? In my apartment . He often goes there when they have fights . He knows where the extra key is , up on the transom . One night I had a friend of mine come home with me , and then when he went home about four o'clock , Earl came out from under the bed . TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( laughs ) : Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wilmer 's right . Earl is a bitch . He stole things from me , too , you know . Nothing worth much , but handkerchiefs . Scarves . If he sees something he likes , he takes it . Steals it . He reads letters that are lying around . Douses himself with my perfume , when I have any . He stole a pair of shoes of mine to go to a drag . Just took them without asking , and denied it , swore up and down and I marched right up to his closet and there they were . I paid twelve dollars for them , and I could never wear them again because he stretched them . He 's a damn nuisance . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Then why do you hope he did n't overhear us talking ? p. 38 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Because he 'll make trouble for Wilmer . Wilmer 's an old queen , and do n't believe what he says about his age . He 's forty , not thirty-three . But of the two of them he 's the nicer one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I said Earl is a damn nuisance Maybe he is n't there . I guess I ought to start putting some clothes on . Do you mind if I make a phone call ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Go ahead . Not to Montreal , though . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( picking up phone ) : Local . To see if I have a job . Chickering 8191 . Hello , this is Veronique McCullough . Will you see if there 're any calls for me , please ? Who ? How much will he pay ? What 's the address again ? Thank you . Goodbye . Well , I work tomorrow . The R. &amp; B. Company , 780 Seventh Avenue . Lingerie . It 's a wholesale house , which means if you want to see me tomorrow night , speak up now , because those buyers will want to take me out , spend somebody else 's money on me , and get a free lay . And if I want to work there again , those are the conditions . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Have dinner with me . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , for photographers . But this is the slack season for them , so I said I 'd take jobs in the wholesale houses . It 's five dollars an hour , less commission . The next time I work for them they 'll double it , if I 'm nice to the buyer I go out with . But if I 'm not nice to the buyer there wo n't be any next time . This is n't my regular agency . This is just a little pimp that has a list of show girls that are out of work . No questions asked . The wholesaler pays him , he pays me . If my work is satisfactory , he charges them double the next time I go on a job . No questions asked , no trouble with the police . The only one that can have any trouble with the police is me , in case the Vice Squad catches me in bed with the buyer . Or I could get pregnant or catch a disease . Or draw some buyer that likes to beat up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Jack the Ripper case last year , it was hushed up because the girl did n't die . She 'd be better off if she had died . p. 39 TOWNSEND RINGWALD Are n't you looking for a job in a show ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH There 's nobody casting now . Oh , plays , but I ca n't act . All I can do is walk . ( She demonstrates a show-girl walk and turn . ) TOWNSEND RINGWALD Mary Leonard said that someone must have taught you to look out over the audience . What did she mean exactly ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , that . Well you know some girls , show girls , how they smile down at the people in the first couple of rows ? ( Demonstrates . ) Not me . I look at the back of the house . Austere . That 's why some of the kids used to call me The Duchess . But you 'd be surprised . I got more letters and people wanting to be introduced to me . TOWNSEND RINGWALD How did you happen to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me . I 'm just a little near-sighted , that 's all . And of course if you look hard to get , why they try to get you . Mr. Carroll picked me out of a line of girls because he said I looked like a nun . I do n't look like any nun that I ever saw . TOWNSEND RINGWALD But oddly enough I understand exactly what he meant . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH So do I. Now . Horse Face ? p. 40 TOWNSEND RINGWALD What ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Were you married to Mary Leonard ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD What makes you ask that ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Were you ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD No . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Why do you lie to me ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( pauses , looks at the floor , then at her ) : Apparently I ca n't lie to you , very successfully . Yes , Mary and I were married in 1917 , so that I could stay out of the army . But I was drafted anyway . We only lived together about three months , I was drafted , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go back together again . She got a divorce and married someone else , and I stayed single . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Is she still married ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD No . The man she married committed suicide . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Why ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Why ? Say , you 're asking a lot of questions . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I told you , I always have to . You never volunteer anything about yourself . TOWNSEND RINGWALD But why are you so interested in my career as a husband ? You never were before . p. 41 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , I was interested , but I never saw Mary Leonard till yesterday , and she made me wonder . She 's older than you are . TOWNSEND RINGWALD A few years , not much . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Why did her husband commit suicide ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Back to that . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Not back to it . We were never away from it . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You 're persistent , are n't you , Rat Face ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I 'm not bright like you are , that 's why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did her husband commit suicide ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Let 's see if I can remember what he put in the note . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes . Tell me that first , and then tell me why he really did it . TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( looks at her in genuine alarm ; she is even shrewder than he thought ) : Why do you say that ? Have you any information about it ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I never heard of him till now . But I hardly ever believe what people put in suicide notes . They 're always blaming other people , or the world . And sometimes they make it very nasty for other people . p. 42 TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( still alarmed ) : That 's what he did . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Who did he make it nasty for ? Her ? You ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Yes . I was n't going to tell you the truth about his note , but I will . He said : " I give you back to Townsend . You belong with one another . " VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To one another . " With . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Oh , you got that , did you ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Where did he do it ? How ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD He jumped out of a window . They were living at the Algonquin . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH What was he ? A writer ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD I guess you could call him a writer . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , either a man 's a writer or he is n't a writer . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Not quite . We have plenty of guys living down here that call themselves writers , but if they 've ever written anything they 've kept it a dark secret . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH He was one of those ? p. 43 TOWNSEND RINGWALD Very much so . One of our leading non-writing writers . He was always around where writers were , and I believe he put some money in Horace Liveright 's firm . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , he had money . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Her money . Mary 's . No , you must n't get him confused with patrons of the arts . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such redeeming feature . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH What was his name ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Morgan Hanscom . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH And he did n't do anything . Just call himself a writer . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Well , he was n't exactly idle , though . He 'd go to parties and insult publishers that Mary had to do business with . Or better yet , get one of her clients off in a corner and tell him what was wrong with his latest book or play . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Why did she put up with him ? She had the money . I guess he really loved her . He did commit suicide over her . That 's why she put up with him . TOWNSEND RINGWALD He did n't commit suicide over Mary , he did n't give a damn about her except as a bankroll . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Then why did he kill himself ? p. 44 TOWNSEND RINGWALD What would make a man like that kill himself ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Money . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Right . Money , and the trouble he got into over it . Mary 's boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a forgery of Singleton 's signature , and gave him twenty-four hours to make good . Singleton naturally hated Hanscom for antagonizing publishers and clients and people like that . Hanscom had cost Singleton a lot of money , and Singleton was delighted that he finally had something on him . " Twenty-four hours , or I go to the police , " said Singleton . Well , Hanscom had only one person to turn to besides Mary . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Who ? I bet I can guess . TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( nodding ) : Me . He called me up and asked me if I 'd lend him a thousand dollars right away . Well , I had a thousand dollars all right , but I wondered why he had n't gone to Mary , and I said so . " Listen , you 've been sleeping with Mary and I never complained , " he said . Screamed , is what he did . Screamed into the phone . And I said , " Are you complaining now , or blackmailing me ? " And he screamed some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and wrote his farewell message . And that was what got into the papers . Nothing about the forgery . Just " I give you back to Townsend . You belong with one another . " The afternoon papers could n't come right out and mention my last name , but everybody knew who he meant . Then a couple of the morning papers did get my last name into print . They said that Miss Leonard was formerly married to Townsend Ringwald , the playwright , who was questioned by police . You see , the cops found out that Hanscom had telephoned me a short while before he jumped out the window . p. 45 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH What did you tell them ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Simply told them he 'd tried to borrow some money , which was the truth , and all I knew at the time . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Were you sleeping with her ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Well , now , what a question . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Were you ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Of course . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I 'm glad you were . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you had n't been sleeping with her , then you 'd have just been stingy . But you were sleeping with her , and he was trying to blackmail you . TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( smiles and shakes his head ) : Your own slant , as always . Not many people took that attitude . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH What do you care ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD I do n't now . I did then . When you have a hit on Broadway you 're vulnerable . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Now you 're the one that 's taking a new slant . TOWNSEND RINGWALD It 's true , though . It was my first and only hit , and I was trying my hardest to prove that success had n't gone to my head . Of course it had , but I did n't admit it , even to myself . I was polite to people I despised , and I lent money to people that despised me . I was nice to everybody , without taking time to realize that the only thing than can cure you of success is more success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since my first and only success . I knew they were n't going to be financial successes , but they were n't the other kind , either . That 's what hurt . That 's why I 'm a son of a bitch . p. 46 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Explain that to me . Why ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD You have to follow your first success with another one , the sooner the better . If it does n't make money , that 's all right , provided you did what you started out to do and can honestly say to yourself that this financial flop is an artistic success . But I could n't say that . My two financial flops were also artistic flops . And I know it . Mary Leonard knows it , too , and wo n't let me forget it . She 's wrong about me in some things . I do n't care about making money again . That is n't the way I want to live any more . The cars and the parties . But I hate her for believing I do . Someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on believing that I 'm afraid of Philip Barry and Michael Arlen . Christ , I 'm afraid of O'Neill , I 'm afraid of Sidney Howard . Elmer Rice . No , not afraid of them . In awe of them . Maybe there 's envy in my admiration of what they 're doing , but it 's not mean envy . And I 'm not afraid of Phil Barry or Michael Arlen or George Kelly . What I am afraid of is Townsend Ringwald , the playwright . The way my name always appears in the papers . Townsend Ringwald , the playwright . I wo n't consider myself Townsend Ringwald the playwright until they can print my name Townsend Ringwald without having to add , the playwright . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , keep trying . p. 47 TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( smiling wryly ) : Oh , I will . Because Mary Leonard and all the rest of them forget one thing . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH What ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD That before I wrote Perihelion I had written two comedies that never saw the light of day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a success . TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( significantly ) : I 'll let you know . One way or the other . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Do n't talk like that , Townsend . She goes to him , puts her arms around him and they kiss . It is an affectionate kiss rather than a prelude to anything else . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Do n't you start telling me how I should talk . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I wo n't any more . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I do n't take direction very easily . Mary Leonard found that out . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Her trouble is that she did n't find it out . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I stand corrected , you are absolutely right . What would you think of living here ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( smiles ) : You want me nearer than two flights away ? p. 48 TOWNSEND RINGWALD Yes , I do . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( shakes her head ) : No , Townsend . TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( looking about ) : There is n't much room . And no privacy . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You need privacy more than I do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say no . A lot of people come down to the Village so they can live with somebody , but I did n't . Just the opposite . I 'm even a little , a tiny bit worried that you want me to live with you . I 'm flattered , yes . But a little worried . We do n't want that , Townsend . Keep it the way it is , me two flights up . You here . I do n't want you to give up your other girls . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Because you do n't want to give up your other men ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Just now there does n't happen to be another man , not really . But that 's not saying there wo n't be , and then I 'd have to move back upstairs . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You 're not saying what you really mean . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You say it for me . TOWNSEND RINGWALD The thing that worries you is that my wanting you to live here is the first sign of possessiveness . Is that it ? p. 49 VERONIQUE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know . But the trouble is I 've had the possessiveness part of it . People have been possessive toward me , but I 've never been in love . And maybe I never will be , because I 'm on my guard against the possessiveness and I do n't let people love me . Or me them . First it was my parents , and then a boy in Montreal , and then another boy in Montreal  --  only he was a man . And then since I came to New York two men and one girl . Every damn one of them started out being possessive . You 're just a little slower than the others , Townsend . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I was just thinking If you had suggested that I move two flights up , my reaction probably would have been the same as yours . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Notice I did n't suggest it ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( on an impulse ) : I 'm going to get some money . ( Goes to the phone . ) Bogardus 3150 Miss Leonard , please . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never get to see you , either . You 're too far uptown Thanks Mary , Townsend . Listen , if the movie offer is as good as you think , how are my chances of getting some money now ? Well , how about $200 ? No , I do n't want five . Two is all I want . I 'm out of hock to Mario , and I 'd like to pay some rent Good , thanks . And send cash , not a cheque . Good-bye . ( Hangs up . ) Very interesting . She said they 've got Warner Brothers up to twenty thousand , and she thinks they 'll go to twenty-five when they hear from the coast . Nothing happens for years , then everything happens all at once . She 's sending me two hundred cash by messenger . I 've never borrowed any money from her , meaning Keith Singleton . p. 50 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Why are you doing it now ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD I have n't wanted to buy anything for anybody for a long time . I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head ) : No . That 's almost the same as moving down two flights . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Oh , but it is n't . I 'm a month behind in the rent , so I 'm going to pay that and get a month ahead . There 's sixty dollars . And even if I spent all the rest on a present for you  --  which I 'm not going to do  --  it would n't be a sable coat . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I do n't want a present , but if you want to buy me one I guess I ca n't stop you . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I owe money at the delicatessen , around fifty dollars . I have five shirts at the Chinaman 's that he wo n't give me till I pay him the fifteen dollars I owe him . You can see your present getting smaller and smaller . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes , but this time tomorrow you will be able to buy me a sable coat . This is all pretending , Townsend . You could buy me a sable coat today , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it . TOWNSEND RINGWALD That 's just the point . I 'm going to keep on pretending , and in some things I have a great knack for kidding myself . Do you know what Mary Leonard said ? p. 51 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH No . TOWNSEND RINGWALD She wanted me to take five hundred dollars and pay up and move out of here today . She thinks the smell of money has got me . She just wo n't learn . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Where are you going with all those clean shirts ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Well , not to the opera . Do you realize that I do n't even own a suit of clothes ? These slacks and a jacket . When I had my shoes repaired I had to walk over to Sixth Avenue and back in my bedroom slippers , the only other shoes I had . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Townsend ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD What ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Why do n't you give Mary Leonard the twenty-five thousand dollars ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( looks at her carefully ) : I do n't have to ask you if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept it , would n't she ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Oh , I think she would . Yes . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Then why do n't you give it to her ? When the messenger arrives , take the two hundred dollars , but tomorrow give her the rest . Do you want to give me a present , Townsend ? That 's the best present you could give me. p. 52 TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( half humorously ) : You sure you would n't rather have a set of sables ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH It 's also the best present you could give yourself . Pay her off , Townsend ! Get rid of her ! Get rid of all the things she says to you . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You think it 's as easy as that , do you ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH It is n't easy , giving away twenty-five thousand dollars when it 's all you have . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Five years ago it would n't have been easy , but it is now . I 've had five lean years and I 'm used to it . And I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars that at this very moment does n't exist . Oh , no , my dear . It is n't that easy . ( He goes to the table . ) Today that money is in the Warner Brothers ' bank account , in Los Angeles . Tomorrow it will be mine , even if I do n't want it . I 'll give it to you . But I wo n't give it to Mary . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH All right . I 'll take it . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You really will ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You 're damn right I will . ( Goes to phone . ) Chickering 8191 Hello , this is Veronique McCullough . Let me speak to Harry , please Harry ? This is Veronique . That job at 780 Seventh Avenue tomorrow ? You 're going to have to get another girl I said , you 're going to have to get another girl . ( She hangs up . ) See what you did for me , Townsend ? He looks at her , puzzled , baffled , incredulous , and unwilling to yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , what did I do for you ? CURTAIN , NOT TOO SLOWLY p. 54 Act 1 , Scene 3 SCENE THREE Same as before , a week later . TOWNSEND RINGWALD is at his typewriter , in white shirt , some slacks and bedroom slippers as before . At rise he is taking a drag on a cigarette and examining the paper in the typewriter , going over what he has written . There is a knock on the door . TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( slightly annoyed ) : Come in . VERONIQUE enters , wearing a fur coat . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well  --  how do you like it ? ( She models the coat . ) TOWNSEND RINGWALD It 's a nice coat . Is it sable ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Lord , no . It 's mink . I did n't spend it all on a fur coat . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Well , it 's very snappy . I suppose you managed to get it wholesale ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Is that supposed to be a razz ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD You have friends on Seventh Avenue . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to me for free . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Not quite free , of course . Well , would you like to sit down for a minute ? Better take your new coat off first . ( She carefully takes off the coat and sits down . ) Would you like a drink ? p. 55 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I 'll have a gin and bitters . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You 're damn right you will , if you want a drink . ( He fixes a gin and bitters . ) Here . When are you moving ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Who said I was moving ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Wilmer . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I did n't say anything to Wilmer about moving . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You did n't have to . He has a sick sense , sixth sense  --  my that 's hard to say  --  sixth , sense about those things . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , his sick sense , sixth sense  --  it is hard to say  --  is wrong . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You would n't give six cents for his sixth sense ? You would n't give six cents for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a bit tired . What else have you been doing , besides deceiving Wilmer and buying fur coats ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , I 've been looking at apartments in the Murray Hill section . I found two I quite liked . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Then Wilmer was right . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Half right . I did n't take either one . ( She looks at RINGWALD 'S manuscript . ) Page 411 . You 're working . The last time I looked you were in the three hundreds . Page 390 , somewhere around there . How is it going ? p. 56 TOWNSEND RINGWALD It 's going very well . I did n't go out of the house all day yesterday or today . I had sour milk in my breakfast coffee . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Keep it on the window-sill , it wo n't get sour so quickly . TOWNSEND RINGWALD After two days it gets sour . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH How long does it take you ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Oh , I can turn sour over night . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH So I noticed . What if I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . Would you keep me company ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD I never refuse a lady . And of course I could n't refuse you anything . I 've certainly proved that . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , I sent for my younger sister . She 's never been to New York . TOWNSEND RINGWALD It 's the land of opportunity , I keep hearing . What does she specialize in ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH As far as I know she 's a virgin . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Actually I did n't mean it that way , but thanks for the information . She pretty ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Petite . Much younger than I am . She 's seventeen . She takes after my mother . I 'm more like my father in looks . p. 57 TOWNSEND RINGWALD It 's totally impossible for me to think of any man looking like you . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Let 's lie down a while and make love , Townsend ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD No thanks . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Are you getting to like Wilmer ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Well , I think he 's getting to like me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have noticed that you have n't been dropping in . Or maybe it 's his sick sixth sense . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Do n't try to say that in front of Wilmer , or he may take it as a hint . TOWNSEND RINGWALD That I was a piece of trade ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yeth . TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( as WILMER enters ) : Why there he is now . Hello , Wilmer . WILMER HIGHTOWER Hello , kids . You dishing about me ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD We were . WILMER HIGHTOWER I thought you and this one were on the outs . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Wilmer , have you got a sixth sense ? WILMER HIGHTOWER Have I got a what ? p. 58 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH A sixth sense . WILMER HIGHTOWER Oh , what a camp ! Have I got six cents ? What are you doing , you big Canuck , camping in Italian ? Youa got ta sixtha thents ? Translate for me , Townsend ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD I ca n't . WILMER HIGHTOWER ( seeing coat ) : Oh , get her ! Where did you ever get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do for that ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Nothing . WILMER HIGHTOWER You mean just sit there ? With an old man ? Do you mind if I try it on ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH It 'll be too big for you in the bust . WILMER HIGHTOWER ( trying on coat ) : I know , but ooh , it feels so  --  mm  --  how do I look ? Can I wear it some time ? I promise to take terribly good care of it . You know , I could win a prize with this . I have just the dress to wear with it , and I 'd do my hair  --  No , I have a wig I paid forty dollars for would be just perfect with this . Come on , Veronique , tell us the history behind it . Every sordid detail . Who , where , what , and how many times . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH If I told you the truth you would n't believe me. p. 59 WILMER HIGHTOWER Well at least tell me was it a man or a woman ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a woman was involved in it . WILMER HIGHTOWER ( knowingly , nodding ) : Oh , yes . Uh-huh . That old stunt. you know who it was , Townsend ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Uh-huh . WILMER HIGHTOWER It was n't that ex-wife of yours , was it ? Not that you 'd tell me anyway . Townsend ? Are you keeping a secret from me ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Yep . Lots of them , Wilmer . WILMER HIGHTOWER Yeah . I 'm not fooled , you know . The word gets around , you 'd be surprised how quick it gets around . Honestly , inside of twenty-four hours every bitch in New York City knew Earl scratched me last week . Every bitch in town . They were flocking in , the joint where I work , just to get a good look . But I got that make-up you told me , Veronique . It 's a wonderful thing to know about . Thanks a lot , really . You could n't hardly tell my face was marred . Is that gin and bitters ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Townsend ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Help yourself . Where 's Earl ? WILMER HIGHTOWER Oh , piss on Earl . He 's off with some old queen , they 're decorating a huge mansion on Long Island . You know how long that 'll last . But do you know what he 's getting , for four weeks ' work ? Six hundred dollars . Six hundred simoleans . I could garnishee that , you know . He owes me more than that . Oh , was he ever cross when he saw me in my new Saks Fifth Avenue . Livid ! And of course my things wo n't fit him , at least my suits . Nasty thieving little bitch . Thanks for the slug , Townsend Oh , say , you button your lip to me , but have I got something for you ! Is Keith Singleton still your agent ? p. 60 TOWNSEND RINGWALD Yes . WILMER HIGHTOWER Did you ever know about him ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD No . WILMER HIGHTOWER I did n't either . Neither did I. I thought I could tell one  --  across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Keith Singleton . Then lo and behold , he shows up at a friend of mine 's party with  --  this is rocking the town  --  Eric Battersby . You know , Eric Battersby , the young English playwright ? Eric Battersby and Keith Singleton , the biggest , hottest thing in town . Keith wo n't let him out of his sight , flew into a rage when Eric danced with somebody else , slapped the other boy right in the face and made the most awful scene . Where have I been , not knowing about Keith Singleton ? I must be slipping . Eric of course I 've known for years , been on many parties with him and adore him , as who does n't ? But this overgrown schoolboy , Keith Singleton . Bulldog , bulldog , bow-wow-wow . Eli Yale . Swipes Eric right from under everybody 's nose . Is n't Keith getting on a bit ? He 's surely fifty . TOWNSEND RINGWALD He 's more than fifty . WILMER HIGHTOWER He was so mean to Morgan Hanscom that time . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course Morgie was a bitch , too . He had n't ought a write that note , but he was desperate . She ( meaning VERONIQUE ) do n't know what the hell we 're talking about . p. 61 TOWNSEND RINGWALD Yes she does . WILMER HIGHTOWER ( eyeing them shrewdly ) : She does ? You two got to the tell-all stage ? I 'd give a lot to listen in on that . You two . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Why ? There 's nothing you do n't seem to know . WILMER HIGHTOWER Oho-ho-ho-ho . What I know , and what two people tell one another , those are two entirely different things . You got one advantage , though , Townsend . TOWNSEND RINGWALD What 's that ? WILMER HIGHTOWER No matter what you tell this one , you could n't shock her . But I bet she 's given you a couple jolts . That is , if you 're both taking down your back hair . This is a terrible woman , Townsend . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Why am I so terrible ? What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is more like it . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , sure , but what did I do that you think is terrible , Wilmer ? WILMER HIGHTOWER That I think is terrible ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Yes , what shocks you ? Or offends your sense of the proprieties . WILMER HIGHTOWER You promise not to hit me ? p. 62 TOWNSEND RINGWALD I wo n't hit you . Maybe Veronique will . WILMER HIGHTOWER ( touching his scratches ) : No , I guess I wo n't . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , go ahead . I wo n't hurt you . WILMER HIGHTOWER Listen , do n't be so sure . This is something you think I do n't know about . If she goes after me will you protect me , Townsend ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH He wo n't have to . WILMER HIGHTOWER All right . She 's trying to break up Earl and I. VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , for God 's sake . WILMER HIGHTOWER Oh , for God 's sake . Did you give him a hundred dollars to sleep with you last  --  uh  --  Tuesday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mink all of a sudden ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD You are an old bitch , Wilmer . WILMER HIGHTOWER Listen , anybody that tries to come between Earl and I , I 'll come between them . She knows Earl is a little double-gaited , especially if there 's a hundred dollars in it . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Do you think I 'd give Earl a hundred dollars to sleep with me ? Me ? With all the people I know in this town ? p. 63 WILMER HIGHTOWER Yes I do , because you always hated me . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Granted , I have no use for you , Wilmer . But that 's not why I gave Earl a hundred dollars . WILMER HIGHTOWER Make me believe that , just make me . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH What 's the use of trying ? WILMER HIGHTOWER No use at all , but I 'm going to get even with you , Veronique . Ever since you moved here Earl 's been horrible to me , perfectly horrible . And you 're the cause of it . I know . Your type always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always try to get them back to your ways , and then when they do go back , you ditch them . You 're ruining Earl , that 's what you 're doing , and that 's why I hate you . And you watch out , Veronique . I 'm a bad hater . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , go wash out your socks , you silly old woman . WILMER HIGHTOWER ( to RINGWALD ) : This one wo n't bring you good luck , Townsend . Do n't say I did n't warn you . ( He exits . ) VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( anticipating RINGWALD 'S question ) : It 's my money , is n't it ? I can do what I like with it . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Anything at all . But watch out for Wilmer. p. 64 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Why ? Will he ruin my reputation ? Or are you worried about yours ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD My reputation is n't any better than yours . But if I were you , I 'd lay off Earl . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You believe what Wilmer said ? TOWNSEND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all wrong . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes . You did n't expect me to take that money . TOWNSEND RINGWALD No , I guess I did n't . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , you can have it back . What 's left of it . TOWNSEND RINGWALD No , I do n't want it back . So far it has n't seemed to do you much good , and I 've been working much better since I gave it to you . No , I do n't want it back . And there are no strings to it . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH No , but you 're dying to know about the money I gave Earl . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I admit that . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH All right , I 'll tell you . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You do n't have to . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I know I do n't have to , the money 's all in my name . But I will . I gave Earl a hundred dollars , and he slept in my apartment . But we did n't go to bed together . Maybe Earl told Wilmer we did , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did once , when I first moved here , but the kind of double-gaited that Earl is , it 's not what I mean by double-gaited . Do you want me to tell you all about it ? p. 65 TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( sensing that she will hate him if he gives an affirmative reply ) : No . I can probably guess . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH It 's a good thing you said no , Townsend , or I would have had you figured all wrong . TOWNSEND RINGWALD It was close between yes and no . VERONIQUE smiles at that remark . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH But no won-out . ( Author 's note : this line has to be read so that it does not seem like " no one out " . ) I gave him the money because he did n't want to have to arrive broke at his new job , the job he 's doing on Long Island . He did n't want to have to ask for railroad fair and pocket money . Earl does n't like girls . He likes me , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not any more . He wishes Wilmer would fall in love with someone else . ( She smiles . ) He suggested you . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Did he make that suggestion to Wilmer ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH No . To me . But maybe he 's planted the idea in Wilmer 's little brain . He probably has . TOWNSEND RINGWALD He probably has . But I 'm afraid it wo n't work . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Why ? p. 66 TOWNSEND RINGWALD I still like girls better . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes . I still like men better . I 'd rather wake up with a man beside me . There 's something sweet about waking up with a man  --  if you like him , that is . You had a good time and gave him a good time , and you 're like two kids . You only get that with a man , at least I do . How I 'll be in ten years from now is another story . 1938 . By that time everybody 'll be flying around in aeroplanes , smashing into each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be over thirty . My Daddy weighs fourteen stone , and I take after him . He says nothing , he is only half listening to her , but studying her , mystified , charmed by an elusive something , feeling tenderness as well . She catches him in this study . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH What were you thinking ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD I was n't thinking . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( nods ) : I do that sometimes . Just look at a person and enjoy them . I wish we could all do that more often , instead of thinking how we can get the better of somebody . That 's what half of our thinking is , trying to get the better of somebody in some way or other . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I do n't know about that . p. 67 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH That 's what you do when you write , is n't it ? You 're getting the better of your hero and heroine . Or maybe you 're only getting the better of yourself , but I 'll bet if you analyse it TOWNSEND RINGWALD Maybe . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH And writers especially . Writers just have to think . Think , think , think , think . You never give your minds a rest . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I just did a moment ago . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes , but you had to think about not thinking . TOWNSEND RINGWALD When do you rest your mind , Veronique ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , I can tell you when I do n't . Not when I listen to music . That 's supposed to rest your mind , but it does n't mine . Or when I go to an art gallery . TOWNSEND RINGWALD How about when you 're making love ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes , if it 's someone I like . It 's nice to feel that way and make him feel that way . I guess that rests my mind . I have to think some , but the more I like a person the less I have to think . TOWNSEND RINGWALD And how about when you drink ? p. 68 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , God ! I have ten thoughts at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so active that it gets tired . That 's why I ca n't drink as much as some people . I get tired and fall asleep from thinking . Just in the time it takes me to have three or four drinks I have every thought there ever was . I may not show it , but God , I 'm thinking . And being near-sighted affects a person , do n't forget . You have to guess sometimes what 's going on , and you overhear little bits of conversation . My parents are glad I 'm in New York . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Why ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH On account of my sister that 's coming to visit me . At home I used to say to her do n't spend so much time thinking , thinking , thinking . And they used to give me holy hell because she was n't doing her home work . TOWNSEND RINGWALD What does your father do ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH He 's a brakeman on the C. G. R. Canadian Government Railways . TOWNSEND RINGWALD How could he afford to send you abroad when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MCCULLOUGH Not on his pay . My mother does tapestries , she could make as much as he does . Maybe that 's how I got my bad eyesight , from her straining her eyes . Maybe not , though . She learned it from my grandmother , and Grand'mre still does n't wear glasses . I know how to do it but I never had the patience . Did you ever kill a man ? p. 69 TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( nods slowly ) : Mm-hmm . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH In the war ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Mm-hmm . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You 're wondering why I suddenly ask you that question ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD I know that there 's some connection with what we 've been talking about . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH There is . That 's supposed to be the worst thing you can do . Right ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Well  --  all right . Yes . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH That 's when you 're more animal than any other time . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I suppose so . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I 'm trying to think of the word . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Atavistic . VERONIQUE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe . TOWNSEND RINGWALD All right . Basic . When you 're killing a man you 're at your most basic . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes . My question is , what did you think at the time ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD I see . What did I think when I was at my most basic ? ( He ponders . ) Well , first of all , I killed more than one man . And I killed men on several occasions , under differing circumstances . The first time I ever killed anybody I killed three or four . I was firing a Lewis gun . A machine-gun . There was another fellow and myself , Joe Cuccinelli . We were set up behind an overturned wagon . There were nine Germans , a corporal and eight privates , and their idea was to take a prisoner . Our idea was to keep them from taking a prisoner . My orders were to wait till they got close and then let them have it . And that 's what I did . What was I thinking ? Well , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nuts , and then I started to fire . You know the French word , enfilade . We pronounced it en-fill-aid . Spray fire . I missed the first German , got the next three , then swung back and I think I got one more . I remember feeling very good about it . p. 70 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Were they all dead , the ones you shot ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Well , if they were n't dead from my shooting they soon were . Our fellows lobbed a few hand grenades at them . Joe Cuccinelli and I moved to another position , quick . A minute later the Germans threw over some mortar shells and blew that wagon to hell . What I was thinking was that I hoped I 'd always be that lucky . And I was . You do n't want to hear about the other times I killed people . It was always the same . You did your best to kill them . The circumstances were different , but the only difference in the thinking was in wondering whether your luck would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine-gunners ' casualty rate was higher than the average . For instance , Cuccinelli was killed by a bullet that was surely meant for me . He stopped feeding the belt , and there he was , dead . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH And what did you do ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD I picked up the gun and charged The hell I did . I hit the dirt and crawled away . That sniper had the range , and he knew one of us was still alive . I was n't pressing my luck . An officer came back to see why I was n't firing , and the sniper got him . Lieutenant Jones . He was n't a bad fellow , so I went to help him but there was nothing I could do for him except drag him to cover . Which I did with a minimum of risk to my own skin . And then it turned out I was dragging a dead man . First Lieutenant Raymond L. Jones , from Cornwall , New York . I went to see his mother after the war . ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstate . You passed it on your way down from Montreal . p. 71 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( she is puzzled by these extra details ) : You went to see his mother ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( nods , and speaks rather slowly ) : Yes . In 1919 . I went to see her . We had a few drinks together . In fact , we both got plastered Good and plastered . I laid her . Right there in the living-room . That was a hell of an experience . And I never told anyone that before , not even Mary Leonard . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , I guess you  --  I could see how that would happen . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You do n't like it , though . Neither do I. Obviously that 's why I never told anybody before . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , truthfully , I do n't . But I do n't know why . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I do . At least I think I do . I was going up there to pay a sentimental call on a little old lady . But she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I knew that as soon as I saw her . But even when she brought out a quart of whisky I still kept saying to myself that this was Lieutenant Jones 's mother . She had pictures of him all over the place . It was darn good whisky , prewar . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Where was her husband , if she had one ? p. 72 TOWNSEND RINGWALD He was at work . I never did see him . She drove me to the station , although she was in no condition to drive a car . She gave me some money , I forget how much , but a lot . I used to think about her and when her husband got home that afternoon and found her plastered . I was glad to get out of there . ( He looks at her . ) I think you 'll understand why I did n't like it . I had n't been to church since I was about nineteen , the year I went to college . And all the way up to Cornwall I had the same feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was going to see a little old lady , a Gold Star Mother . And when I got there , instead of being in church with a little old lady , I was in a nice , middle-class front parlour with a pushover . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You make me sick . TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( surprised ) : Why ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You just do . I thought writers were supposed to have understanding . Well , I hope you never try to write about a woman character . If you could n't understand that poor woman you would n't understand anybody . TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( fighting back ) : I understood her all right . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Did she ever try to get in touch with you again ? p. 73 TOWNSEND RINGWALD No . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH No , I 'll bet she did n't . Her son 's friend comes to see her , and she 's touched . What can she do ? She knows he 's just out of the army , so she gives him a drink . Lots of drinks . She 's what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of them have been grieving over their son . Nice young man comes to see her and she 's so grateful that she 's what you say , a pushover . But you never thought to ask yourself why she was a pushover . You make me sick , you men . You often used to wonder what happened when her husband came home . Did you ever stop to think of the other days too ? Years of being ashamed of herself ? Why , every time she 'd look at those pictures of her son she must have felt ashamed of herself . God , you 're horrible . And so pious . She spoiled it for you because she was n't a little old lady . What did you do for her ? And even now , all you can think of to call her is a pushover . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I see you can always be depended upon to take the woman 's side . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( steadily ) : Well , I do n't hate women , the way you do . TOWNSEND RINGWALD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your play ? Not this one ( indicating the manuscript on the table ) , the one that was a hit . p. 74 TOWNSEND RINGWALD Perihelion ? Yes . Why ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I 'm going to have to read it . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I do n't see why , but go ahead . Over there 's a half a dozen copies , help yourself . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Maybe after I read it I 'll want to give you back your money . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Oh , now really , Veronique . You 've taken money from people you did n't like . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Sure I have , but I 've never taken money from anybody I like till I took this money from you . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Are n't you a little confused ? You 're talking in circles . You do n't take money from people you like , but you liked me when you took this twenty-two thousand three hundred dollars . Now you 're going to read my play and dislike me , and therefore return the money . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I 'm not confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person who gave me so much money , and a nice experience . If I 'm going to dislike you , I do n't want to enjoy anything about you . You know , I 've still got about eighteen thousand dollars in the bank . I could give that to Mary Leonard . And she 'd take it , too . TOWNSEND RINGWALD In a flash . Before you could change your mind . p. 75 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Maybe I 'll give it to her anyway . I wanted you to give it to her so you could get rid of her . Maybe I 'll give it to her so I can get rid of you . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Keep the coat , though . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , I 'll keep the coat . It 's money I do n't like . Oh  --  an afterthought . I 'm going to keep some of the money for when my sister gets here . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Do n't tell me . I did n't ask you for an accounting . It 's Mary 's money now . VERONIQUE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . I 'm going to read this , and then maybe I 'll read one of those plays that closed in Atlantic City . TOWNSEND RINGWALD That was an exaggeration of Mary 's . They never even got to Atlantic City . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( devilishly ) @x Two flights up , VERONIQUE 'S apartment . A week or so later . It is inexpensively furnished , but with imagination and in the prevailing moderne mood . There are unframed pictures on the walls , the inevitable folding screen of varnished New Yorker covers , tubular chairs , strange dolls , masks , statuettes after Jacob Epstein , etc . In contrast with RINGWALD 'S apartment , however , the atmosphere is neat , orderly . It is a one-room flat with studio couch against the wall at Left . Entrance is by a door cut through the wall at Right . The same stove and sink arrangement , behind the folding screen , as in RINGWALD 'S apartment . The telephone is on a night table beside the studio couch . The bathroom is through a door in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-length , ceiling to floor , strips of bright coloured material . It is late afternoon , early evening , and VERONIQUE and her sister JEAN are getting ready to receive guests for cocktails . JEAN is " petite " , not so much in stature as in a kind of frailty and daintiness that the word suggests , and which contrast with VERONIQUE 'S tall , independent , self-sufficiency . It is not too much to say that JEAN is more French than her Scotch-Irish sister . JEAN MCCULLOUGH ( in French . She is washing cocktail glasses ) : Where do you keep your tea-towels ? p. 77 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( in French ) : You 'll find a dry one in the drawer under the gas burner . JEAN MCCULLOUGH ( still in French ) : Here ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( in French ) : Yes . ( In English ) : And by the way , only one of the people coming this afternoon speaks French . His name is Townsend Ringwald . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Townsend Ringwall ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes , he 's a writer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Is he a Canadian ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH No . To tell you the truth I do n't know where he 's from . One of the western states , I guess , but I never asked him . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Is he your lover ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( lightly ) : Of course . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Seriously ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Why must I have a lover ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH ( looking about the flat ) : This is a place where you would have a lover . It reminds me of Paris . p. 78 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH How could it remind you of Paris ? You do n't remember anything about Paris , you were too young . And our uncle did n't live in a place like this . JEAN MCCULLOUGH That 's just why I say , this is a place to have a lover . And you have lovers , Nique . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH In two years you 've learned a lot . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Did you expect me not to ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well  --  I guess I did , but it does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so am I. And so is everybody . Have you got a lover ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH Not a real one . A boy at Loyola . A sophomore . Henri Duplessis ? You remember him ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Good Lord . He 's in college ? We are two years older , are n't we ? Are you going to marry him ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH Two years from now , when he takes his degree . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Will you have me for maid of honour ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH Of course . Need you ask ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , I was n't told . JEAN MCCULLOUGH How old is Townsend Ringwall ? p. 79 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Older . Thirty-five , maybe . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Who else is coming ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Just two others . JEAN MCCULLOUGH ( quickly ) : Men ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( amused at her speed ) : Yes . One is even older than Ringwald . His name is Wilmer . Wilmer Hightower . The other is Earl . Earl Fisher . He 's about my age . They also live in this house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this house ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH No . There are , one , two , three , four . Four other girls . Or women . Two of them live on the top storey , across the hall from Wilmer and Earl . And the others live on this storey . But I have n't made friends with either of them . You know , I 've only been here about six months . JEAN MCCULLOUGH But you 've made friends with the men . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You could put it another way . They 've made friends with me . JEAN MCCULLOUGH I beg your pardon . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Granted . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Could I get a job on the stage , Nique ? p. 80 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH The first thing they 'll ask you is what experience you 've had . JEAN MCCULLOUGH What did you tell them ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH It was different with me . I did n't have to act , or sing and dance . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Oh , I know what you did . I saw your picture . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Where ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Vanity Fair . Could I do that ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I think you 'd have to be taller . Did Papa and Mama see those pictures ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH No . They never heard of that magazine . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Not many have , in Montreal . Where did you see it ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH I saw it at one of the fraternity houses . At McGill . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Henri goes to Loyola . JEAN MCCULLOUGH ( petulantly ) : I know he does . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Well , why not ? The McGill boys are more fun . Could you introduce me to the people that hired you ? p. 81 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH It would be a waste of time now . All the girls are hired for the new shows . But next summer I could , when they 're hiring show girls . That 's what I was , a show girl . You do n't wear much in the way of clothes . JEAN MCCULLOUGH I saw your pictures . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes , and what if Henri and Mr. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulders ) : Maybe I would n't care . How tall do you have to be ? I could wear higher heels . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Dearie , you 're hardly unpacked and we 've got these people coming . Do n't try to do everything at once . Wait till you 're here a few days . You may not like New York . JEAN MCCULLOUGH ( dramatically ) : I love it ! All those mad people in the streets , hurrying somewhere . Those big beautiful limousines , coming down Fifth Avenue . And the buses . I want to ride on top of one of those buses . And that place you took me to lunch . That hotel . They all spoke French there . Better French than we speak . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH The Brevoort . Tomorrow I 'll take you to another place just like it , in the next street . The Lafayette . But that was a special treat , Jean . I do n't go there every day . p. 82 JEAN MCCULLOUGH If I could go there once a year ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men flirted with me at lunch . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I saw them . You 've had men flirt with you in Montreal . JEAN MCCULLOUGH That 's different . Here they meant it . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH What did they mean ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH I do n't have to tell you . You know what they meant . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH They do in Montreal , too . JEAN MCCULLOUGH ( shakes her head ) : No . It is n't the same . These men were bad . At home , they 're just flirty-flirty . But those men today  --  I was glad I was with you . I 'd have been frightened , alone . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH And you like being frightened ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH Yes . That is , I like to go to a first-class restaurant , where you 'd never expect to be frightened . And know that two men are saying very wicked things about you . In Montreal  --  that 's home . Am I tall enough to be a model ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes . JEAN MCCULLOUGH I could start as a model , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 83 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH All in good time . JEAN MCCULLOUGH You sound like Grand'mre . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH That 's good , because I meant to . Have you ever had a Martini cocktail ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH No . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Then only take one , and do n't drink it too fast . Or would you rather have a glass of wine ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH I 'll have what the others are having . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH All right , but mind you . One . And drink it slowly . This tube is anchovy paste , you can squeeze some on the biscuits . That 's all they 'll want . There is a knock on the door . It is WILMER . WILMER HIGHTOWER Hello , hello . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Hello , Wilmer . I was n't sure you 'd come . WILMER HIGHTOWER Oh , curiosity . I had to see what your sister was like . I 'm Wilmer . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Jean , this is Mr. Wilmer Hightower . WILMER HIGHTOWER Just Wilmer , to my near and dear ones . JEAN MCCULLOUGH I 'm pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's cute . She 's the way you must have been , ages ago , Veronique . You 're pretty , Jean . Are you in show business ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH Not yet . WILMER HIGHTOWER Well , you should n't have too much trouble  --  one way or another . Would you like to be like your big sister ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH Yes , very much . WILMER HIGHTOWER ( clears his throat ) : Mm . Well , that should n't be too hard . In fact , very easy , if you know what I mean . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH All right , Wilmer . All right . Where is Earl ? WILMER HIGHTOWER Earl is my friend . Veronique is terribly interested in Earl . Why , he 's coming . He 's prettying up . JEAN MCCULLOUGH ( mystified ) : What ? WILMER HIGHTOWER He 'll dazzle you with his colouring , Jean . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( who has been stirring cocktails ) : Here . Let her find out for herself . WILMER HIGHTOWER But at the same time , he 's very expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to know . p. 85 WILMER HIGHTOWER Oh . This is a good cocktail , Veronique . You can hardly taste anything but Mother 's Downfall . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH He means gin . WILMER HIGHTOWER ( to JEAN ) : Are n't you having one , dear ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH I guess so . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Do you want yours now ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH Yes . WILMER HIGHTOWER Oh . Sister is protective , is n't she , Jean ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH ( taking cocktail ) : Yes . WILMER HIGHTOWER Well , welcome to the great big wicked city . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Thank you . WILMER HIGHTOWER ( knocks off his drink and extends empty glass ) : As they say , my first today and God knows I need it . I won a prize last night  --  and without your coat . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You could have had my coat . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Why would he need your coat ? WILMER HIGHTOWER I want to hear you explain that , Veronique. p. 86 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I know you do . You 've been leading up to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fairy is ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH Of course . But I thought they got mad if you called them one . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Not Wilmer . WILMER HIGHTOWER You were n't very subtle . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Neither were you , so why should I be ? WILMER HIGHTOWER I thought you 'd be more delicate in front of the kid sister from Montreal . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You thought you had me on a spot , that 's what you really thought . WILMER HIGHTOWER And Jean 's embarrassed , are n't you , Jean ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH I do n't know . WILMER HIGHTOWER See ? Jean 's the one that 's put on the spot , and you put her there . You shoulda been more delicate . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Oh , stop talking about me , please . ( She gulps her drink . ) VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You 're going to have to get used to a lot of things if you want to live in New York . WILMER HIGHTOWER Oh , good . Are you going to live in New York ? p. 87 JEAN MCCULLOUGH I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes ago . You changing your mind already ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH I did n't say for sure I wanted to live here . WILMER HIGHTOWER Listen , Jean . This is the place . The rest of the country is Bridgeport . JEAN MCCULLOUGH I do n't come from this country . WILMER HIGHTOWER Well  --  Canada 's practically . I did one-nighters in Canada . Toronto  --  that 's Canada , is n't it ? Hamilton . Niagara Falls . I was working for somebody named Jean , too . Jean Goldkette . I played piano with Jean . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Is that what you do ? WILMER HIGHTOWER Oh , not any more . I still play piano , but no more bands , thank you . No  --  thank  --  you . What a life that is . I get offers all the time , but who wants to live in a bus all their life ? Not yours truly . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Why do you have to live in a bus ? WILMER HIGHTOWER Why do you have to live in a bus ? Because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one o'clock in the morning and then you have to get in the bus and drive to Hagerstown , Maryland , a couple hundred miles away . And the night after that you 're back somewhere near Mahoney City . What booking ! It 's absolutely ruinous to the disposition . And the money is n't good . Do n't let anybody tell you the money 's good . Listen , some weeks I make more from tips than my week 's salary with a band . The other night I had a Cuban millionaire give me a hundred bucks just to play " A Media Luz " . You know , that tango ? Diddle-umpta dumpta dum . We got a regular comes to the joint twice or three times a week , and as soon as I see him I go into " On , Wisconsin " . Good for five bucks every time . You can have playing with a band . p. 88 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH And at your age , too . WILMER HIGHTOWER Never mind about my age , Veronique . Just give me another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I heard a good one . A boy that would tell his age would tell anything . What 's keeping Earl ? I did n't say who . I said what . A knock on the door ; it is RINGWALD . WILMER HIGHTOWER Oh , I thought you 'd be Earl . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Ah , too bad , Wilmer . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Hello , Townsend . I 'd like you to meet my sister , Jean . Jean , this is Townsend Ringwald . JEAN MCCULLOUGH I 'm pleased to meet you . WILMER HIGHTOWER She 's cute , is n't she ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD I do n't need your help , Wilmer . How do you do , Miss McCullough . WILMER HIGHTOWER Everybody 's picking on me . ( He sits down , away from the others . ) TOWNSEND RINGWALD How was your trip ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH On the train ? I did n't see much . I came down on the sleeper . WILMER HIGHTOWER Keep your eyes open next time , you 'll see plenty . p. 89 TOWNSEND RINGWALD Pay no attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : How can you help it ? WILMER HIGHTOWER Now she 's razzing me . I 'll turn on you , Jean , and you 'll be sorry . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Shut up , Wilmer . Has Veronique been showing you the town ? WILMER HIGHTOWER It 's still daylight . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Oh , shut up , Wilmer . WILMER HIGHTOWER Not going to be much of a party if I do n't talk . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Well , let 's give it a try . WILMER HIGHTOWER And you do n't have to be formal with Jean . Her big sister started out by telling her I was a fairy . So the ice is broken . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Maybe Jean would have figured that out for herself . And anyway , you 're not going to sue for damages , are you ? ( To JEAN ) : I take it you knew what a fairy was . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Yes , but I was surprised when Nique came right out with it . WILMER HIGHTOWER Heavens , you were n't surprised that she knew ? That one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't she know ? She 's older and more experienced . WILMER HIGHTOWER Oh , God , what an opening . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , we 're all waiting . WILMER HIGHTOWER Yeah , that 's the trouble with an opening like that . I pass . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Good . Well , even if the ice is broken , Jean , it 's all right if I ask you some plain ordinary questions . JEAN MCCULLOUGH I wish you would . I 'm not used to this kind of conversation . WILMER HIGHTOWER I 'm squelched . JEAN MCCULLOUGH I do n't want to squelch anybody , I just do n't want to have to think twice before I talk . Is that the way everybody talks in New York ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Lord , no . But in this part of town there 's quite a bit of it . At least when there 's a Wilmer around . And the more Wilmers , the more of that kind of conversation goes on . Luckily they all talk at once , so you do n't have to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you going to see any plays while you 're here ? WILMER HIGHTOWER ( groaning ) : Oh , God . Ask her what she thinks of our skyscrapers . p. 91 JEAN MCCULLOUGH I have n't seen any very big ones . TOWNSEND RINGWALD If you 're not doing anything tomorrow I 'll take you downtown . That 's where the big ones are . Downtown . WILMER HIGHTOWER You better get in there , Veronique . He 's moving fast . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Tomorrow we 're going shopping , but any other day . WILMER HIGHTOWER While you 're up , pour me another drinkie . JEAN MCCULLOUGH They do n't seem to affect him . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH They will . TOWNSEND RINGWALD And watch out for him when he bares his fangs . He 's merciless . WILMER HIGHTOWER Maybe you do n't think so , but do n't you try my patience , Townsend Ringwald . I have a few saved up for you . Oh , there we are . ( As EARL enters ) : And are n't we ravishing ? EARL FISHER I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got in from Long Island , and I was all over paint and plaster . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH My sister , Jean . This is Earl Fisher . JEAN MCCULLOUGH I 'm pleased to meet you . p. 92 EARL FISHER How do you do , I 'm sure . Hello , Town . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Hello , Earl . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH How 's your job going , Earl ? EARL FISHER ( looks hesitatingly at WILMER ) : Well  --  this was my last day . WILMER HIGHTOWER Your last day ? What do you mean , your last day ? You have three weeks to go . EARL FISHER He fired me . WILMER HIGHTOWER You did n't tell me that upstairs . Why are you breaking this terrible news in front of these strangers ? EARL FISHER Oh , Wilmer , shut up . WILMER HIGHTOWER I suppose you told him what he was doing was puke . EARL FISHER Well , it was . He ought to be ashamed to take the money . WILMER HIGHTOWER And since when are you so rich that you can pass up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand in this . Hand in it indeed . TOWNSEND RINGWALD All right , Wilmer . Enough of that . WILMER HIGHTOWER You ! Where do you come in ? Do n't you start acting gallant . Who do you think you 're kidding ? Well , her ( he means JEAN ) but she 'll find out quick enough . p. 93 TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( to VERONIQUE ) : Shall I throw him out ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes . WILMER HIGHTOWER Do n't touch me . I 'll go of my own accord . ( To EARL ) : And as for you , you 'll find your things out in the hall . Start sponging off someone else for a change . EARL FISHER All right . WILMER HIGHTOWER All your things will be out in the hall . Do n't even knock on the door . ( To JEAN ) : Good afternoon to you , Miss McCullough . It 's been a great pleasure , I 'm sure . Just as much for me as it was for you . ( To all of them ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who . RINGWALD starts to rise , and WILMER dashes to the door . WILMER HIGHTOWER Do n't you dare ! Do n't you dare ! ( He exits . ) VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Did you lose your job , Earl ? EARL FISHER I would n't kid about that . I had four hundred and fifty coming . He guaranteed me four weeks ' work . But I just could n't keep quiet . Really . You should see what he 's doing with a lovely big room . He 's making it into another Roxy . I wanted to scream and I finally did . p. 94 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Earl 's been working for a decorator , on Long Island . EARL FISHER Decorator . Townsend 's little pigsty has more charm than  --  Oh , I give up . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Did he pay you ? EARL FISHER He sure did , honey . He got me out of there before I could say anything to the owner . Gave me a hundred and fifty . The awful part is , he knew I was right . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean for personal reasons . He was such a coward . He said when I was leaving , he said he was only doing what the owner wanted . Good heavens ! Such a coward . Jean , do n't you ever get into interior decorating . JEAN MCCULLOUGH I wo n't . I do n't know the first thing about it . EARL FISHER That does n't stop some people . Town , I saw a friend of yours last night . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Who ? EARL FISHER Keith Singleton . He was at a party where I was . I danced  --  ( he checks himself , suddenly remembering JEAN ) with a friend of his . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( gratefully ) : Earl , you have n't got a drink . EARL FISHER Oh , I do n't even know if I want one . Just a little one . Liquor 's going to be my downfall . I revelled in it last night at the party and did n't get home till practically dawn . You know how those parties are . They do n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in shows all have to go home and change . ( To JEAN ) : A sort of costume party . Wilmer went as Jeanne Eagels , and I must give him credit , he deserved his prize . Then I finally got home and got about two hours ' sleep before I had to drag my poor weary bones up to Penn Station and take the train to Long Island , feeling like the wrath of God . And of course this would be the day my employer picked to positively desecrate the big room . So I  --  I just let go . I do n't know what I 'm going to do next . Have this drink , I guess . JEAN has been watching the others to get their reaction , but they are used to him . p. 95 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You 'll find something to do . EARL FISHER Oh , I know . But I wish I did n't always have to work for someone else . I ought to have my own business , with my own studio . But it takes money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any . Did you ever hear of an old witch named Mrs. J. Francis Krag ? Filthy rich . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You ought to know about J. Francis Krag . He 's a famous architect . EARL FISHER He 's alive ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD He 's pretty well along , but I think he 's still alive . EARL FISHER Oh . I met this new friend last night . Mrs. Krag is helping him financially , and I got to wishing I 'd meet somebody like that that would help me financially . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Does it have to be an old witch ? Why not a young witch ? EARL FISHER Listen , I 'm not going to look at her teeth to see how old she is , as long as she has enough to help me financially . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Why does it have to be a woman ? Why not a man ? EARL FISHER ( looks at her quizzically ) : Well , there 's that , too . There 's always that , Jean . Say , how much does this kid know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 're a sly one . I think you know more than you let on . p. 96 TOWNSEND RINGWALD Maybe she learns fast , Earl . EARL FISHER That may be it . Anyway , she 's a cute one . Are you going to get a job in New York , Jean ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH Some day , I hope . EARL FISHER ( appraisingly ) : What is she , about a twelve ? Veronique , you could teach her to walk . In fact , I could . Stand up , Jean . Oh , no . No , no , no . Never that way . You 're not defending the bridge at that Greek place . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Thermopylae ? EARL FISHER ( ignores him ) : You know , Jean . You 're not daring people to charge . Do n't stand with your legs dug in that way . Stand this way . One thigh crossed over the other so that you do n't show a bit gap at the crotch . You know , if you stand with your heels together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your heels together , well you make this gap right here , because being a girl you ai n't got nothing there . One foot in front of the other , one thigh crossing over , just enough to hide that gap . Now you try it . If you could take off your skirt I could show you better . JEAN , hypnotized , starts to obey him , then looks at the others . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH He 's right . Go ahead . p. 97 JEAN MCCULLOUGH Yes , but what about  --  Mr. Ringwald ? EARL FISHER Oh , honey , give him a cheap thrill . You 're among friends . JEAN shrugs her shoulders and quickly gets out of her skirt obediently and hands it to EARL . EARL FISHER Oh , she wo n't have any trouble , Veronique . She could get some hosiery work . Now stand the way I told you . There , that 's better . Shoulders back . You do n't have to be brazen , Jean . Just confident . Now walk towards your sister . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It shakes itself , honey . Show her , Veronique . VERONIQUE demonstrates a show-girl walk . EARL FISHER ( to JEAN ) : I hope you realize , Jean . Your sister is being very big-hearted . ( To VERONIQUE ) : If this kid was two inches taller she 'd put you out of business . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I 'm out of business . EARL FISHER ( handing JEAN her skirt ) : All right , honey . You 're doing fine.Practise it , and inside of a week  --  The door opens ; it is WILMER with a suitcase . WILMER HIGHTOWER Here 's your junk , every last thing you own . He sees JEAN , skirt in hand . He throws the suitcase at EARL , then makes a rush at VERONIQUE. p. 98 WILMER HIGHTOWER I 'll kill you , you bitch . RINGWALD wards off WILMER 'S attack and receives some slaps and kicks , but he is stronger than WILMER and braces his arms . EARL goes to JEAN , to protect her from possible attack by WILMER . WILMER HIGHTOWER Whores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you. I 'll kill all of you ! TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( holding and pushing him ) : Out , Wilmer . Out . ( Propels WILMER to the door , pushes him out and shoots the bolt . ) WILMER 'S VOICE ( offstage  --  banging on door ) : I 'm going to call the police ! I 'm going to call the Vice Squad . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Ah , shut up , you God damn faggot . There is silence , WILMER presumably going away , and the silence is heavy , each person with his own thoughts . Then VERONIQUE notices EARL in a protective attitude toward JEAN , an arm around her . RINGWALD , with his back to the door , is looking at VERONIQUE and studying her reaction . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You better put your skirt on , Jean . EARL sighs audibly . He is unaware of any significance in his instinctive defence of JEAN . JEAN is frightened by the outburst , is busy putting on her skirt . p. 99 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Is he still out there ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( listens at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I 'm sure he is n't . He 's probably half-way to Mario 's by now . I think I 'll have a cigarette . TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( opens door cautiously and closes it ) : He 's gone . EARL FISHER Anybody else want a cigarette ? Jean ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH I guess so , yes , thanks . ( EARL lights it for her . ) It was all my fault . I 'm sorry . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH It was n't anybody 's fault . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Wilmer 's . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , not even his . He ca n't help himself . EARL FISHER Maybe , but after this I 'll never go back . I 'll never go back again . TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( to VERONIQUE ) : Do n't be so damn forgiving . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Do n't you tell me what to be . You have killed people , and it did n't do anything to you . Wilmer  --  what he 's going through is wanting to kill somebody . That 's much worse . p. 100 TOWNSEND RINGWALD You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to thank you . All right , thank you . He wanted to kill me , but he could n't have . I would n't have let him . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You may get a chance to prove that . Wilmer is n't through yet . EARL FISHER He 's right , Veronique . I never saw him like this before . This is n't just a tantrum . And he went after you , not after me . You 're the one he blames . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , he should . What did it look like ? Jean 's my sister , and we 're getting ready for a party . That 's what it looked like to Wilmer . JEAN MCCULLOUGH You ought to thank Mr. Ringwald . I thank Earl . He was going to protect me . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes , I noticed . That 's going to make Wilmer madder than anything , when he stops to think about it . EARL FISHER It surprises me . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Did he go to Mario 's ? Is that where you think he went ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Townsend , will you take me there ? p. 101 TOWNSEND RINGWALD What for ? What good will that do ? He 'll think you 've come to taunt him . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I do n't care what he thinks about that . Or about anything else . But if he 's going to make any more trouble , let him make it with us instead of somebody else . Me , instead of somebody else . I 'm not afraid of Wilmer . EARL FISHER ( quietly ) : Veronique . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH What ? EARL FISHER You better be . I honestly mean that . He hates you worse than anybody that ever lived . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Why ? EARL FISHER Oh  --  this and that . He thinks he has plenty of reason , and anyway , Wilmer does n't need any reason . Wilmer 's not all there . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Oh , well that explains it . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You 've got advice from an expert , so forget about going to Mario 's . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Please do n't go , Nique . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left with me ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH I do n't know you , Earl . EARL FISHER No , I guess you do n't . VERONIQUE realizes that she had not given any thought to JEAN alone with EARL . She is strongly influenced by his instinctive rush to JEAN 'S defence . p. 102 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH All right , I wo n't go . But you two , I wish you would n't say things that frighten Jean . In the first place I do n't believe them . Wilmer 's furious , but he 's not dangerous . EARL FISHER Well  --  you have it your own way , Veronique , but I know him . TOWNSEND RINGWALD When he 's furious , he 's dangerous . Everybody is , and especially a desperate old queen like Wilmer . Am I right , Earl ? EARL FISHER I 'm afraid of him . I admit it . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , I 'm not . Now I say , let 's the four of us go out to dinner . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Yes , I 'd like to go some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to that Basque place over on Bleecker Street.Wilmer wo n't be there . He 's never been there that I know of . EARL FISHER My treat . I got paid today . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH No , it 's my party for Jean . ( Smiles at RINGWALD . ) Well  --  it 's really Townsend 's party . ( She puts her hand on his arm . ) Do n't mind what I say when I 'm cross . They put on coats and turn out the light and exit . When they have gone , the door opens . WILMER . He looks about him for a moment , then goes to VERONIQUE 'S wardrobe as the curtain descends. p. 103 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO VERONIQUE 'S apartment , a few hours later . At rise the door is opened and the light is switched on . VERONIQUE , JEAN , EARL and RINGWALD enter . They are all in good spirits , but nobody is drunk . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Oh , I like New York all over again . That place was like Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was little . JEAN MCCULLOUGH And Uncle took us to a place like that . I remember . Uncle and Aunt and Mama and you and I and all the cousins . It had a tile floor . I remember that . And they put a cushion on my chair . All the people knew each other , and it was the only time Uncle took us out . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You 're right . I remember that . EARL FISHER I had an offer to go to Paris but Wilmer made me turn it down . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Well , now you can go , if the offer 's still good . EARL FISHER Oh , the offer 's still good . I get plenty of offers . Jean , you had a good time . I 'm so glad . JEAN MCCULLOUGH I had a marvellous time . Earl , you 're so funny . You make me laugh . p. 104 EARL FISHER I got a couple of good ones , did n't I ? But do n't forget Townsend , he 's a wisecracker , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just a camp , that 's really what I am . But it gets laughs . It is n't what I say , it 's the way I say it . It would n't sound funny coming from Townsend . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( to JEAN ) : Tomorrow you can wear my coat . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Can I honestly ? Oh , I can hardly wait to get one of my own . EARL FISHER Maybe she better find out how much they cost , ch , Veronique ? What you have to pay for them , dearie . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( slightly annoyed , but decides not to make a reply . She is standing in front of the wardrobe , hesitating about speaking , then opens the wardrobe door and reaches in for a hanger , gets hold of a hanger , then draws back ) : Oh , my God ! Look at this ! TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( quickly alarmed ) : What ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Every one of my dresses . ( She tosses the fur coat on the couch and takes out a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds them up for the others to see . ) Every one of them . EARL FISHER He 's been here . p. 105 TOWNSEND RINGWALD Good Lord . You know this is serious , Veronique . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Do n't I know it 's serious . EARL FISHER Let me have a look at one . ( He examines a dress . Nods . ) Uhhuh . You know what he did it with ? My shears , my heavy shears that I use for cutting wallpaper . He had himself a time doing this , all right . Look how evenly . Honestly , I do n't want to exaggerate or anything , but if I were you I would n't sleep here tonight . ( He suddenly goes to the hall door , opens it , and reaches up on the outside transom . He returns . ) He let himself in with the extra key . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH How did he know about it ? EARL FISHER Oh , I guess I told him . I 'm sorry . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , we can bolt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cops , but  --  VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH No . No , no , no . No police . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Now wait a minute . EARL FISHER I think Townsend 's right . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Now listen , I know a sergeant . Sergeant Hinchcomb , I knew him when I was on the Evening World . He 's over on Charles Street . I might be able to get him to pick up Wilmer on a drunk charge . At least I can try , and I wo n't have to say anything about this . p. 106 EARL FISHER ( shaking his head ) : He wo n't be drunk , Townsend . He 'll be more sober than you or I. TOWNSEND RINGWALD The point is to get him locked up for the night . It 's the best way to keep him out of trouble . Let me see if I can get Sergeant Hinchcomb . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH No , I do n't want you to . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Do n't be stubborn . Do n't you see it 'll be better for him ? EARL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did thirty days on the Island one time . He told me he 'd never go through that again . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Listen , all of you . He 'd be a damned sight better off doing thirty days on a homo charge than what he faces if he goes after somebody with a pair of shears . EARL FISHER He 's only mad at one person , Townsend . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You think so ? Well , why do n't you go out and try to find him ? JEAN MCCULLOUGH No ! TOWNSEND RINGWALD I say let 's get the cops before he kills somebody . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( impatiently ) : Oh , what for ? He was angry at me and he got even by cutting up my dresses . That does n't mean he 's going to go around killing people . p. 107 TOWNSEND RINGWALD Unfortunately that 's exactly what it does mean , but you 're stupid . JEAN MCCULLOUGH You shut up ! TOWNSEND RINGWALD You shut up , little girl . Keep out of this . ( To VERONIQUE ) : Ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Any what ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Psychiatrist . Do n't you know what a psychiatrist is ? Have n't you heard of psycho-analysis ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , that . I would n't rely on anything they said . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Or anyone else . I can see that . Well , do you remember a week or so ago , telling me about a girl that would be better off if she 'd been killed ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH No . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You do ! Think ! The model . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( remembering ) : Oh . TOWNSEND RINGWALD They 're the same thing . The same mentality . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I do n't believe it . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Listen to me . They 're finding out more and more about criminals these days . p. 108 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes , by beating them up . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Not by beating them up , by getting them to talk . Getting them to brag , in some cases . And one thing they 're finding out , you stubborn fool , if they go back into a murderer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find , that something in his past gives at least a hint of how he 's going to commit a murder . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Then why do n't they stop them ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD That 's what I 'm trying to do . Wilmer is psychopathic.Do you know what that is ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Crazy . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Well , that 'll do . Unbalanced . And right now that 's what Wilmer is , and he 's dangerous . EARL FISHER He is , Veronique . Townsend 's right . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , I know what you 're saying . Voodoo . Sticking pins in dolls . What 's His Name over on MacDougal Alley . Pierre , from Haiti . Listen , Townsend , I know all the queers and all the queer ways and things and everything queer , and I do n't believe for one minute that Wilmer Hightower is out to kill me because he snipped my dresses with a scissors . ( Lightly ) : I could kill him , what he did to those dresses . p. 109 JEAN MCCULLOUGH Do n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , you know I did n't mean it . EARL FISHER ( to JEAN ) : They 're heavy , too , those shears . You know , they 're made to cut through several thicknesses of wallpaper . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Like a tailor 's . We have another uncle that 's a tailor . EARL FISHER Resembling a tailor 's , yes . You could do a lot of damage just hitting a person . They could be a real deadly weapon . TOWNSEND RINGWALD If you wo n't let me call the cops , I have another suggestion . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH What ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD You and your sister sleep in my apartment tonight . EARL FISHER That pigsty ! How anybody could sleep there  --  although I guess some have . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Look , Earl , save your campy humour for some other time . EARL FISHER I apologize . TOWNSEND RINGWALD The windows are barred , and there are two locks on the door . JEAN MCCULLOUGH My first night in New York I did n't expect p. 110 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( favourably inclined ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lock both locks . Put the table against the door , if you feel like it , and do n't open the door for anyone but me or Earl . EARL FISHER Does that mean you and I are supposed to spend the night here ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Yes , are n't you happy about that ? EARL FISHER I am if you are , you rough tough old thing . Seriously , no . I do n't want to be in this room tonight . He might come back and mistake me for Veronique . You can stay here , but I 'll go up to the Y.M. I 'll find some place . Seriously , I think you 're right about the girls , though . Kids , you ought to stay in the pigsty , just for tonight . TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( to VERONIQUE ) : All right ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I guess so . It 's much ado about nothing , but you 've frightened Jean . EARL FISHER You know what 's going to be funny . If tomorrow breakfast  --   --  Townsend . TOWNSEND RINGWALD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Call the joint where he works , and see if he 's there . p. 111 TOWNSEND RINGWALD A good hunch . Do you know the number ? EARL FISHER If I think . Yes . Circle 4646 . TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( into phone ) : Circle 4646 That 's right Hello , would you let me speak to Wilmer Hightower ? Wilmer , the piano player He is n't ? Did he say he 'd be late or anything ? It 's personal He did n't call at all Thank you . They sounded a bit annoyed . He has n't been there all night , and has n't phoned . EARL : And you know Wilmer . He even went to work the night a certain person scratched him . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Who ? EARL FISHER ( patting her head lightly ) : Oh , a friend of his . Well , we know one place where he is n't . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Let 's try Mario 's . I 'll do it . Watkins 9244 Hello , Mario ? This is Veronique McCullough Fine , thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilmer Hightower ? He has n't No , no thanks . In fact I 'd rather you did n't . I just wanted to know if he was there . Thank you , Mario . Well , you heard that . Has n't been there all evening . ( To JEAN ) : Mario said to be sure and bring you in while you 're in town . ( To all ) : I told Mario not to tell Wilmer I called , in case he does come in. p. 112 EARL FISHER I was wrong about him going to Mario 's . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Actually , in a way you were right . EARL FISHER Why ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD You said he always hightails it for Mario 's when he 's sore about something , but tonight he is n't just sore about something . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH There you go , making a mountain out of a molehill . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I 'm interested in everything he does that is n't his usual routine . Where else would he be likely to go , Earl ? Where was the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No use calling there . It was a big one . They thought there might be a raid , it was so big . We do n't often have big ones downtown , only Harlem . Friends . Friends . Who else ? If he was real desperate there 's a boy over on Eighth Street smokes muggles , but Wilmer gave them up . They do n't go with gin . Anyway , I do n't know the boy 's name . Not his last name . His first name is Dale . Dale Something . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I know him . Dale Faber . EARL FISHER That 's it ! VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I 'll see if his number 's in the book . p. 113 EARL FISHER He can get other things in addition to muggles . JEAN MCCULLOUGH What are muggles ? EARL FISHER Uh  --  a special brand of cigarette . They also go under the name of reefers . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Here it is . Watkins 1611 . One six , one-one Hello , could I speak to Wilmer ? I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say mine either , but I know you He 's a piano player . Middle-aged I wanted to talk to him . It 's important No , I 'm calling from a pay station . You ca n't call back Well , why did n't you say that in the first place ? ( Hanging up ) : He has n't been in for over a year . What shall we do , start with A and go through the whole book ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD No , but I 'll bet he 's not very far from here . In the Village somewhere . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Why ? Have you got a hunch , too , like Earl 's ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Call it that . EARL FISHER You think he 's roaming around somewhere , Townsend ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD I may be wrong . But if he 's roaming around , Sergeant Hinchcomb could pick him up inside of an hour . Every cop on post has to phone in once an hour , all at different times . At this minute some cop is what they call boxing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets down here are n't very crowded at this time of night . Why do n't  --   --  p. 114 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH No . This whole thing is n't going to amount to anything . But Jean and I will sleep in your apartment , just so just so you 'll stop fretting . EARL FISHER It is n't like him not to go to work , Veronique . There is a knock on the door . They all look at each other , and RINGWALD picks up a tall brass figure of a sitting cat and holds it behind his back . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Come in , it 's unlocked . No it is n't either . ( Unlocks and unbolts the door . A fiftyish woman in a man 's bathrobe enters . ) HAZEL POMEROY I 'm Hazel Pomeroy , from the floor above . Good evening , Miss McCullough , Mr. Ringwald . I have this letter for Mr. Fisher . Mr. Hightower asked me to give it to you when you came in , but I was in the midst of taking my bath . VERONIQUE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? This is my sister , from Montreal . HAZEL POMEROY Oh , thanks very much , but I have to be up so early . You know , I teach . I 'd love a drink some other time . Mr. Hightower wanted to be sure you got this tonight . He 's so nice , Mr. Hightower . Whenever we have anything heavy to move . EARL FISHER Thank you . When did he give you this ? p. 115 HAZEL POMEROY Oh , I guess it was around nine-thirty or ten . I did n't take notice to the time , but I was in the midst of correcting papers . Yes , about nine-thirty or ten . It must be important , because he gave me five dollars to stay awake till you all got in . Well , good night . Good night , everyone . EARL FISHER You would n't think it to look at her now , but she had an affair with the King of England . TOWNSEND RINGWALD The Kaiser , not the King of England . EARL FISHER That 's who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has pictures of them on a yacht together . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Open your letter ! EARL FISHER I am , I am . Give her a few drinks and she 'll tell you all about it . And I mean all . Kaiser Bill . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH It takes you longer to open a letter . EARL FISHER It 's my letter ( He reads it , then rereads it . ) It is n't very long . ( He finishes it , and is undecided whom to give it to . He decides to give it to RINGWALD . ) TOWNSEND RINGWALD Do you want me to read it aloud ? EARL FISHER Well , I think it would be better if you did . p. 116 TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( reading ) : " Earl , " it says . And it 's signed Wilmer . " Earl , " he says , " You must leave there right away . I am not responsable . " Spelt a-b-l-e . " My brain is going around and around and want to kill somebody . " Underlined . " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll read it again . " Earl you must leave there right away . I am not responsable . My brain is going around and around and want to kill somebody . You know who . Wilmer . " VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , we all know who . But that does n't say he 's going to do it . TOWNSEND RINGWALD He thinks he is . Quite convinced of it . This is n't a hysterical letter , Veronique . He does n't say " I 'm going to kill somebody " . He says he wants to kill somebody . It 's almost as though he were talking about somebody else , not himself . If he came right out and threatened you , Veronique , I would n't be so concerned . But he knows somebody , namely himself , is going to do something , and he wants Earl to be somewhere else when he does it . We 'll take you and Jean down to my room and see that you 're safe for the night . Then Earl , you might as well take his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he 's somewhere in the neighbourhood , waiting to see if you leave . JEAN MCCULLOUGH Why must Earl go ? Maybe he 'll attack Earl as soon as he sees him alone . p. 117 TOWNSEND RINGWALD He does n't want to attack Earl . Earl is really the only one he does n't want to attack . Now let 's do what I say , please ? EARL FISHER You take the girls down to your room . I want to see what he put in my suitcase . I 'll wait till you come back . TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( besitates , then agrees ) : All right . ( He and the girls , with their nightgowns , exit . EARL goes to the phone and speaks softly into it . ) EARL FISHER Watkins 6517 . Six five one seven . ( In the silence a phone can be heard ringing not far away . Simultaneously with the cessation of the ringing EARL speaks softly ) : You fool . I knew you were still in the building . Townsend wants to call the police . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be arrested All right . I 'll meet you wherever you say Dale 's ? You mean Dale Faber 's on 8th Street ? All right . But go now , before Townsend has a chance to call the police . He 's downstairs , the dames are spending the night in his room , and then he 's coming back here . You get out right away , and be careful you do n't run into him in the hall No , I 'm not cross . Not really All right , Wilmer , but hurry . He hangs up . He pours a shot of gin and drinks it . Lights a cigarette . Opens the wardrobe and takes out a mutilated dress and holds it up to examine it . He is doing that when RINGWALD returns . p. 118 TOWNSEND RINGWALD They ought to be safe for the night . EARL FISHER I hope so . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Yes . Jean took quite a shine to you . EARL FISHER ( dispassionately : She 's a nice kid . I did n't mind her at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EARL FISHER Yes , I do . I do n't dislike her , but after all , Townsend . She 's not built right for me . TOWNSEND RINGWALD But you go for girls sometimes . EARL FISHER No , not really , but sometimes they go for me . Then they 're sorry and they think it 's my fault . It is n't my fault , it 's theirs for getting hot pants . When I was a kid the other kids used to yell at me , " Earl got curls but do n't like the girls . " And they were right , I did n't . But they liked me , big ones and little ones . I did n't get started with boys , Townsend . I got started with girls . You should of seen our neighbourhood , where I grew up . There was n't a house had a coat of paint on it . You could n't see the sun for the smoke , even on a clear day . The smoke from the mills . And two big girls used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen , but I was only ten or eleven . They 'd wait for me after school . They used to take me to the movies . The Perils of Pauline . I had a teacher in school and she used to try to protect me , but then she , she just got as bad . But at least she put up the money to pay for my year at Tech . That 's how I went to Tech for a year . I was a whore that far back . I guess I was always a whore , from when I was about ten years of age . And can I tell them ! Veronique better get that Jean back to Montreal . She 's ready and willing , even if she does n't know it . One thing about being a whore , though.You never worry . p. 119 TOWNSEND RINGWALD What ? EARL FISHER You do n't . You may have to take a cut , but you do n't worry . Like tonight , I leave here and I got a dozen places I can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother used to say . Good night , Townsend . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Give us a ring in the morning . EARL FISHER All right . Some time tomorrow . ( Takes bag and exits , and RINGWALD goes to phone . ) TOWNSEND RINGWALD Spring 3100 Connect me with the Charles Street Station-house ? I want to speak to Sergeant Hinchcomb Sergeant Hinchcomb , please Hello , Hinch ? This is Townsend Ringwald Oh , fine . Fine Hinch , I want to ask you a favour . The door opens . It is VERONIQUE , who looks angrily at RINGWALD , then crosses to him and puts her hand on the phone to disconnect it , speaking as she crosses. ) @x Immediately following Act Two . Continuous action . At rise VERONIQUE 'S hand is on the telephone . TOWNSEND RINGWALD What 's the matter with you , you damned fool ! VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Give me that phone . He keeps it from her grasp , then gives up . TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( disgusted ) : Take it . Take it . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH What right have you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Then why do you ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Because I do n't think it is your affair . It 's gone beyond that . Tomorrow he may be all right , but tonight he 's not . He should be kept from  --   --  Here there is a frightful scream from somewhere nearby , followed by another scream that ends abruptly . TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( quietly ) : Did you leave my door open ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , no ! Oh , no ! She starts to leave and he grabs her firmly , they tussle , and as they tussle WILMER enters . p. 121 WILMER HIGHTOWER ( looks with incredulous horror at VERONIQUE ) : I thought she was you . I thought she was you . I did n't mean to kill her . VERONIQUE breaks away and runs downstairs , and RINGWALD deliberately punches WILMER in the chin , knocking him out . WILMER collapses on the floor and RINGWALD leaves him there . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You poor miserable son of a bitch . I hope you do n't wake up . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sergeant Hinchcomb , Charles Street Station . It 's important Hello , Hinch . Townsend Ringwald again Yes , I know . I know we were Hinch , I have a homicide to report Eighty-four West Third Street . And I have the man that did it . I knocked him out with a punch .

You 'll get all that Oh , I can handle him . Anybody could , now Hinch ? Do n't let them rough him up too much . He 's an old fag . Not so old . His name is Wilmer Hightower , and he 's lying here on the floor . He 'd be better off if he never got up Try to come yourself , will you ? I do n't want your boys thinking I did it . Okay , Hinch .

I 'm going downstairs . He bangs up , and as he does so VERONIQUE appears in the doorway . p. 122 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( shaking her bead ) : Do n't . ( She goes to him slowly and be takes her in his arms , but she can not take her eyes off WILMER . ) VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( wearily ) : Is he dead ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD No . I knocked him out . He 'll come to in a few seconds . MISS POMEROY appears . HAZEL POMEROY I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RINGWALD He had an accident . Go away , please , Miss Pomeroy.The police are coming . HAZEL POMEROY Did you kill him ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Look at him . ( WILMER is coming to . ) Miss Pomeroy , the police 'll be here any minute . HAZEL POMEROY I have nothing to be afraid of . TOWNSEND RINGWALD We want to be by ourselves . HAZEL POMEROY ( haughtily ) : Oh , well . ( She exits . ) VERONIQUE looks at WILMER with fascination , loathing and pity . WILMER HIGHTOWER What are they going to do to me ? p. 123 TOWNSEND RINGWALD You 'll have to wait and see . WILMER HIGHTOWER I can get away ! TOWNSEND RINGWALD No you ca n't , not if I can help it . And I can . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Let him go . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Let him go ! If you 'd let me call the cops earlier I 'm sorry . But  --  VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You ought to be on his side . You 've killed people . Wilmer , what are you thinking about ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get away . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You do n't want to kill me any more ? WILMER HIGHTOWER ( getting to his feet ) : Townsend , you 'll let me go . TOWNSEND RINGWALD She would , but I wo n't . WILMER HIGHTOWER You know what they 'll do to me . They 'll take me down in the cellar and turn the hose on me . That 's what they do , the police . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( to RINGWALD ) : Is that what they do ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD That 's one of the things . Sometimes . p. 124 WILMER HIGHTOWER They 'll make me stand in a corner for hours and hours . I know . I 've been arrested . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Wilmer , are you sorry ? WILMER HIGHTOWER I 'm afraid . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes , but are you sorry ? WILMER HIGHTOWER What are you asking me questions for ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I want to know if you 're sorry you did that to Jean . WILMER HIGHTOWER She was a bitch , too , but not as bad a one as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rationalize . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You wanted to kill me , did n't you , Wilmer ? WILMER HIGHTOWER You know that . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Then are n't you sorry you killed the wrong person ? WILMER HIGHTOWER Maybe she was n't the wrong person . Can I use the phone ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD No . What for ? WILMER HIGHTOWER I want to call somebody . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Who ? WILMER HIGHTOWER If you let me use the phone you 'll find out . p. 125 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Let him use the phone . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Tell me who you 're going to call . WILMER HIGHTOWER I want to call Earl . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Where is he ? WILMER HIGHTOWER If you let me use the phone you 'll find out . You want to find out where he is so you can tell the police . I do n't want to use the phone . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You 're absolutely right . But they 'll find him . If I were you , Wilmer , I would n't hold out on the police when they ask you where Earl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his running away . WILMER HIGHTOWER He did n't run away from anything . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You seem to know a lot about Earl and where he is . WILMER HIGHTOWER Why should n't I ? I talked to him not a half an hour ago . TOWNSEND RINGWALD How did you know he was here ? WILMER HIGHTOWER I did n't . He knew I was upstairs . Oh , he 's clever , Earl . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You were hiding upstairs ? WILMER HIGHTOWER For hours . TOWNSEND RINGWALD And Earl knew it ? p. 126 WILMER HIGHTOWER He called me , did n't he ? I warned him , I sent him a note . So he warned me . You ca n't come between Earl and I. I told you that . That boy 's loyal to me . TOWNSEND RINGWALD He told you where the girls were . WILMER HIGHTOWER Of course he did . What do you think ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD He told you where they were , and let you go and kill Jean . WILMER HIGHTOWER That 's not the way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he practically put you up to it . WILMER HIGHTOWER No he did n't ! TOWNSEND RINGWALD Yes , that 's the way it was , Wilmer . You may not think so , but that 's the way it was . He practically put you up to it , but he made sure he was nowhere around . WILMER HIGHTOWER ( making a rush at RINGWALD ) : No it was n't ! It  --  was  --  not . ( RINGWALD shoves him aside . ) You want to get Earl in trouble on account of her . You 're jealous of Earl because of her . Earl could have her any time he wanted her , but he did n't want her . She was the one that wanted him . She always did want him . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Well , what if she did ? p. 127 WILMER HIGHTOWER What if she did ? Her sister would n't be dead , that 's what-if-she-did . A police siren , followed by another police siren and various offstage male voices are heard . WILMER suddenly becomes panic-stricken . WILMER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Townsend . Veronique ! You help me . TOWNSEND RINGWALD ( opening door and calling downstairs ) : We 're up here . Hinchcomb ? Hinch ? We 're up here . Yes , he 's here . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( to WILMER ) : I did n't try to take Earl away from you , Wilmer . CURTAIN p. 128 Act 3 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO The time is some years later , the scene , a luxurious apartment on the upper East Side . At rise TOWNSEND RINGWALD has his back to the audience as at rise in previous scenes , but as he turns it is seen that be is wearing a well-cut dinner jacket . He has two on-the-rocks drinks in his hands , one of which he hands to VERONIQUE , who is dressed in chic hostess pyjamas . They are accustomed to prosperity and to each other . He is whistling " The Lambeth Walk " , and at the end of the chorus she sings : VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Doing the Lambeth Walk , hoy ! TOWNSEND RINGWALD Where shall we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to a lot of places , but let 's not try any experimenting . We 'll go to Morocco , where we 're known . TOWNSEND RINGWALD As a matter of fact , I would n't even know what other places to talk about any more . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH The Stork . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Yes . And Montparnasse . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes , Montparnasse . Larue , for that matter . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Would you say we were in a rut ? p. 129 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH If it 's being in a rut to go to places you like , and stay away from places you do n't like . Morocco 's where I see the people I care about seeing . It 's like the Savoy Grill . Everybody is n't there every night , but you have a better chance of running into people at Morocco , or the Savoy . So why waste time at the other places ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD I was thinking of where Eric might like to go . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Morocco of course . Although I guess we could take him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stork , and Lord Beaverbrook . At least they were there the other night . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I doubt if Eric and The Beaver would have much in common . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , but they 're both English . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Not really . Beaverbrook is one of your people . He 's a Canuck . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Lord Beaverbrook is ? I did n't know that . Are you sure ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD I 'm sure . His name is Max Atkins . No , not Atkins.Aitken . He 's from one of the Maritime provinces . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Now how do you know that ? How do you keep up with those things ? p. 130 TOWNSEND RINGWALD I do it when I 'm supposed to be working . I often read every God damn word in Time , just to put off going to work . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH All that stuff in the front , too ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Everything . The Rh factor . Religion . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Why do you ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD I told you . To put off getting back to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there in the papers except Hitler and Mussolini , and of course Roosevelt . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Yes , and they 're going to be for a long time to come . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Oh , you keep saying things like that , as if you knew something about it . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I do n't claim to have any inside information , but I think any damn fool knows we 're headed for war . They 're getting ready , and so are we . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , if enough people go on talking like that of course there 'll be a war . You 're talking yourselves into it . There is a distant buzzer . PEARL , the maid , crosses from Left to Right and goes out to the foyer up Right . In a moment ERIC FABER enters , goes straight to VERONIQUE and embraces her without disturbing her coiffure. p. 131 ERIC FABER Dear Veronique . And Townsend . ( The men shake hands . ) A Bourbon on the rocks , before you have a chance to ask me . Do n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot of other people do live here . ERIC FABER Well now , surely Keith Singleton did use to live here ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD A long time ago , yes . ERIC FABER I knew it . Leastaways I thought I did . He did n't die in this building ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD No , he died in the country . ERIC FABER I always say , stay out of the country . Well , you two appear to be living a healthy city life . You have n't put your royalties into horses and guns and other such kiddie nonsense . A steam yacht , possibly ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD Not even a steam yacht . ERIC FABER Of course they 're all Diesel now , are n't they ? What is Diesel ? I 'm not embarrassed to ask you , Townsend , as I am so many people . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I believe it 's a fuel . A kind of oil instead of gasoline . Or petrol . ERIC FABER Yes , I think so . But it 's German , is n't it ? p. 132 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a German named Diesel invented the Diesel engine , and that takes Diesel oil . It would be more accurate to say that the Diesel engine came before the Diesel oil . ERIC FABER ( nodding politely ) : Mm . Well , thank you . Is n't it nice to have Townsend to enlighten you on such things ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Did he enlighten you ? ERIC FABER Well  --  a man called Diesel invented something called Diesel , that 's either a kind of petrol or a kind of engine . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Or both . ERIC FABER Yes , but I can only take in one thing at a time . For tonight , Herr Diesel is the inventor of the engine . What do you think of the Germans , by the way ? I have n't had much chance to sound out American public opinion , having disembarked only this morning . TOWNSEND RINGWALD What do you ? You 're closer to it . ERIC FABER Well you see , Townsend , I have so many friends Germans . In fact , Nazis . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at home , but there are still a great many of us who understand their point of view , and at least to a certain extent , sympathize . You 're expanding over here , but you have so much room . The Germans want to expand , but where to ? We ourselves had to expand and we went all over the face of the earth , grabbing whole continents , you might say . My Nazi friends tell me that all they 'd like to do is unite the German-speaking peoples , and that seems fair enough . p. 133 TOWNSEND RINGWALD I do n't think Britain would do so well if they tried to unite all the English-speaking peoples . They might hear from us , at least a feeble note of protest . ERIC FABER You 're having me on , Townsend , and I suspect that you 're anti-Nazi . But you 're not a Jew , at least I do n't think you are . TOWNSEND RINGWALD No , I 'm not . In fact , I 'm of German descent . Ringwald . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FABER Well , I , of course , was a Jew . Leastaways , my grandfather was , then he became C. of E. Church of England . But I 've always been sympathetic to Jews and my friends in the Nazi party have never raised the question . Hitler has nothing against the Jews , other than those who oppose him . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I was a Catholic . Does n't anyone want to hear about that ? ERIC FABER Yes , tell us about it , Veronique . What was it like ? Forgive me , but I did want to ask what you over here thought about the Germans . People , not Mr. Roosevelt . He seems very impatient , and some of us are afraid that he 'll push us into a war and then leave us high and dry . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I do n't think he 'll do that . ERIC FABER I do n't know . At home we hear that Mr. Roosevelt wants a war but that the American people do n't . Therefore he could make some of our people count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your people would refuse to go . Is that possible ? p. 134 TOWNSEND RINGWALD The American people could vote him out of office the year after next . They may anyway , on the third-term issue . ERIC FABER The third-term issue . Shall we go back to Herr Diesel ? Veronique , is that Schiap ? It is , is n't it ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes . I went haywire last summer . ERIC FABER Well , why not ? Townsend is making so much money . Three big hits , and you sold them all to films , I read . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH And he has another one for late this season . TOWNSEND RINGWALD If I ever finish the revisions . But you have a hit in London , Eric . We saw it , and it 's delightful . Deserves to be a hit . ERIC FABER I was desolated not to be there when you were . I wish you could have been with me in Sweden , too . Have you been ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH No , but we 're going next year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I was mad for the people . They 're the most beautiful people I 've ever seen . Ever . Have you ever had an affair with a Swedish girl , Townsend ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD No . ERIC FABER You must make him have an affair with a Swedish girl , Veronique . I do n't want you to be stuffy about it . Promise me. p. 135 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH If he wants to , I wo n't stop him . Why , did you ? ERIC FABER Now , come . But in the first place they 're beautiful , simply beautiful . And in the second place , a friend of mine told me that  --  this was an Englishman  --  who said that with the possible exception of a Japanese girl , no woman on earth is as good for a man 's ego as a Swedish girl . And do you know why ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I can guess . ERIC FABER No you ca n't . The reason is , that when she feels like ending the affair , she does , and usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he realizes that he was honoured by her having an affair with him in the first place . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Why is that particularly Swedish ? I 'm a Canadian , half Irish and half French , and that 's exactly how I feel about the whole thing . ERIC FABER Oh . But you 're you . I do n't think of you as having any nationality . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You got out of that pretty nicely . Townsend , get into practice . I hear Swedish girls like to drink . RINGWALD takes their glasses . ERIC FABER What are we doing tonight ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Dinner here , and then we 'll take you on the town . p. 136 ERIC FABER Have you got someone for me ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Mary Leonard is coming . ERIC FABER I adore Mary . Anyone else ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes . Do you remember Earl Fisher ? ERIC FABER Earl Fisher . Of course I remember him , and I would n't have to remember him . I think he 's very nearly the best you have , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . If my play goes on here , I want him to do it . I 'm going to insist on it . TOWNSEND RINGWALD You ca n't have him till he 's finished with my play . He does all my plays . He has to , I got him into the theatre , away from interior decorating . ERIC FABER Did n't he do this flat ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes , but he does n't do many . He has n't got time . He does commercial work . Industrial , they call it . He has fifty people working for him . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Sixty-five people , full time . The theatre is n't where he makes his money . Is Jack doing your play over here ? ERIC FABER Not this one . Pollock and Chase are doing this one . Fifteen per cent , because they 're just getting started and want an English name . Snobs , are n't they ? p. 137 TOWNSEND RINGWALD The reason I asked , Earl Fisher wo n't work for Jack , but that 's not saying he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to work on him . The buzzer again sounds . Maid crosses as before and admits MARY LEONARD . She is dressed by Valentina , her hair is all grey and cut very short . MARY LEONARD Eric darling . ERIC FABER Mary , my dearest love . They embrace . MARY LEONARD ( rubbing cheeks with VERONIQUE ) : Hello , sweet . Hello , Townsend . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Mary , that 's new . MARY LEONARD Brand new . First time out . Townsend , I think I 'd like a long drink . Scotch and plain water . We 're not quick running in to dinner , are we ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Not for half an hour or so . We 're going out later . MARY LEONARD You do n't think I 'd have worn this just to sit around , and I know I 'm not going to impress Eric . ERIC FABER But you do impress me . You 've completely changed your type . You do n't wear those deer-stalking costumes any more . MARY LEONARD Referring to my expensive suits ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because when Keith was alive he did n't want any of us small fry to outshine him . He was the bird of paradise in his office . p. 138 ERIC FABER But now it 's your office ? MARY LEONARD Now it 's my office , and nobody that works for me can afford to outshine me . I see to that . ( She sips her drink . ) Have you seen the afternoon papers ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH No . Maybe Townsend has . What 's in them ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD You mean about Czecho-Slovakia ? MARY LEONARD No . I mean about Wilmer Hightower . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH What about him ? MARY LEONARD He 's out on parole . VERONIQUE sits back to consider the news . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Parole . I forgot about parole . MARY LEONARD There 's just a little squib at the bottom of a column . I called his lawyer , the one he had at the trial , but he was n't in his office . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Why did you call his lawyer ? MARY LEONARD Well , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go back to playing the piano . Under the parole rules he 's not supposed to return to his old job , or his old haunts , or even his old friends . I 'm just afraid he might look up some of his old friends and get arrested for being naughty . Or he might pick up a sailor . The town 's full of sailors . And if he gets into trouble , back he goes for violation of parole . p. 139 TOWNSEND RINGWALD I think you ought to stay out of it , though . MARY LEONARD Well , you 're entitled to think that . You 're married to Veronique , and she certainly ca n't be expected to help him . ERIC FABER Wilmer Hightower . He stabbed somebody ! See , I remember . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH He murdered my sister , Eric . And now he 's free . Is n't that nice ? Nine years in prison , with a lot of boy friends I 'm sure , and now he 's free . Townsend , did you know he was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be eligible for parole so soon , but I have n't thought about him lately . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I have . Every day of my life . It was me that he wanted to kill . The maid admits EARL FISHER , now no longer brash but smoothly dignified . EARL FISHER Hello , dears . And Eric Faber . Do you remember me ? I 'm Earl Fisher . ERIC FABER ( with a new respect for EARL and his poise ) : Remember you ? I tell everyone I used to know you . EARL FISHER Well , I do the same . And our paths almost crossed in Stockholm last summer . I missed you by one week . You 'd just gone . I heard you had a perfectly grand time in Sweden . p. 140 ERIC FABER I 've been telling the Ringwalds . Do n't you agree with me that Townsend must have an affair with a Swedish girl ? EARL FISHER Why ? ERIC FABER Well , it would do him good . MARY LEONARD No , what Townsend needs is a flop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ERIC FABER In a curious roundabout way that 's what I 've been trying to tell him . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I may be working on it . MARY LEONARD No , not this one . You 've got another hit , I 'm positive , with or without Kate Hepburn , although with her , a bigger one . EARL FISHER You 're not going to get Kate , I happen to know . Do n't ask me any more , but give up on Kate . Have you seen the afternoon papers ? TOWNSEND RINGWALD About Wilmer Hightower ? Mary was just telling us . EARL FISHER I think it 's shocking . I really do . You know what 's going to happen . MARY LEONARD What ? I do n't . EARL FISHER Well , nothing good . Where can he go ? He wo n't have any money . I think they give him ten dollars , and it 's against the law for him to work at whatever he was doing before . Or to take a drink . Or hang around the places he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . p. 141 MARY LEONARD I called his lawyer . EARL FISHER You did ? What for ? MARY LEONARD I wanted to find out what Wilmer 's plans were . EARL FISHER That was rather cheeky of you . MARY LEONARD Not at all . We 're all doing well . Could n't we give him some money ? Not Veronique and Townsend , but some of the people he used to know . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I 'm under the impression that before they grant him a parole he has to prove that he has a job of some kind . EARL FISHER But all he could ever do was play the piano . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Maybe he learned something in prison . EARL FISHER Ha ha . Nothing he did n't know before he went in , if you know what I mean . Prison would be awful for some people , but for Wilmer it would be sheer paradise . Think of being in such demand . MARY LEONARD Did n't you ever write to him or anything ? EARL FISHER Of course not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Veronique is one of my dearest friends . I was wishing he 'd get the chair . MARY LEONARD Well , I can see where he might have been better off . p. 142 PEARL Miss Leonard , telephone for you . Mr. Emmett J. Cassidy . MARY LEONARD The lawyer . Thank you . Veronique , could I take the call in here ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH If you want to . MARY LEONARD I do . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( to maid ) : Pearl , will you bring the telephone in here for Miss Leonard ? PEARL Yes ma'am . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Why do you want us all to be in on this ? MARY LEONARD I 'm thinking more of Veronique than the rest of you . Thank you , Pearl . Hello , Mr. Cassidy . Thank you for returning my call . I wanted to know about Wilmer Hightower Yes , I 'm the literary agent , and I was a friend of his . ( Puts her hand over the mouthpiece , and says to the others : " He said , Just a minute. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Yes , hello , Mr. Cassidy Why of course I would . ( MARY : " He 's putting Wilmer on . " At this VERONIQUE rises and starts to leave , but RINGWALD gently puts his hand on her shoulder to make her stay . ) Hello , Wilmer . How are you ? No , I 'm  --  not at home . I 'm with some friends of mine . How are you ? Yes , I imagine it does seem very strange . Where are you staying ? Let me write that down . Three-twenty-four West Eighty-fourth Street . Is that an apartment ? I did n't know they had boarding-houses any more Oh , I see . You have your meals  --  I see What kind of a job ? Well , it 's something to do for the time being , and meanwhile you can be looking for something better No , it would n't embarrass me to see you . Come to my office tomorrow afternoon around five All right , call me up any day next week , and I 'll let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . I 'm Townsend 's agent , you know He has . He 's done very well . He 's working on a new one , almost finished , and I think it 's going to be a big success . Keep your fingers crossed You 'll what ? Pray , did you say ? You 're a what ? That 's what I thought you said . When did that happen ? That long ago ? And you 're still one ? Then it took . It really took No , I would n't try to see her , Wilmer . You can write to her , care of me , and I 'll see she gets your letter , but I would n't try to see her I do n't think she 'd want me to give you her address . You write her care of my office , and if she wants to see you she 'll let you know , but I do n't feel that I have the right to give you her address . Their phone is unlisted Any day next week . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I have a business lunch with somebody every day , but I 'm nearly always back by three o'clock . How are you fixed financially ? But why do n't you let me lend you some ? But you do n't want to go on doing that for ever You have changed No , I do n't think I have . Just older No , as they say , I 'm wedded to my business , and I 'm not sure whether I 'm the husband or the wife , but I 'm wedded to it You 're not keeping me , but I 'm probably keeping you . You probably want to talk to Mr. Cassidy , so you ring me up next week Thank you , Wilmer . ( She hangs up , but her hand rests on the phone as she ponders the conversation . ) You did n't want me to give him your address , did you ? p. 143 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH No . TOWNSEND RINGWALD What kind of a job 's he got ? MARY LEONARD He 's washing dishes in a cafeteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that . In a factory , for instance , although I do n't know what . MARY LEONARD ( she is still in a deeply reflective mood ) : He does n't want anything better . He does n't want any money . He has a room in a boarding-house on the West Side . He played the organ in the prison chapel . ( She looks at VERONIQUE . ) He 's turned Catholic . Five years ago . Got interested in religion through playing the organ , and turned Catholic five years ago . I wish you all could have heard him . You would n't have known it was Wilmer . ERIC FABER I 've heard that they lower their voices in prison . MARY LEONARD It was n't only that . Calmer . Serenity . Gentle . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( bitterly ) : Gentle . MARY LEONARD Yes . I never would have recognized his voice  --  not exactly his voice , but his whole manner of speaking . I would n't have believed a voice could change that much . I keep saying his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person could change as much as he has . p. 144 EARL FISHER Did he say anything about me ? MARY LEONARD No , he only asked about Veronique and Townsend . He knew you had a lot of hits , Townsend , and he 's going to pray your next one 's a hit . Pray . That 's how it came out that he 'd turned Catholic . He wants very much to see you , Veronique . EARL FISHER He did n't ask about me at all ? MARY LEONARD No . EARL FISHER In a huff , I suppose , because I never sent him any goodies . Well , I 'm glad I did n't . MARY LEONARD He 's not in a huff about anything , Earl . That 's just it . Not in a huff . Content to wash dishes . And wanting very much to see Veronique . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Veronique does n't owe him anything . Most of all she does n't owe him a quick easy forgiveness . And that 's what he wants . MARY LEONARD There I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but forgiveness , yes . EARL FISHER I agree with Townsend . Veronique does n't owe him a thing . I think he has a nerve to even hope to see her . What I do n't understand is your attitude , Mary . Why are you so Eleanor Roosevelt about all this ? MARY LEONARD Oh , I do n't know . I guess it goes back a long way . Long before you were anybody , Earl . Before you ever came to New York , when you were back in Pittsburgh , PA , cutting out dolls ' dresses , I suppose . But Townsend remembers . A husband of mine named Morgan Hanscom. p. 145 ERIC FABER Morgan Hanscom . I knew Morgan . MARY LEONARD Yes , I guess you 'd have known him . ERIC FABER Forgotten he was your husband  --  if I ever knew it . MARY LEONARD Yes , I 've had two husbands . Nobody can ever call me an old maid . EARL FISHER That 's one of the last things anybody 'd call you , Mary . MARY LEONARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know I was ever married . Not the old crowd , of course . EARL FISHER If you 're trying to lord it over me , dearie , you 've succeeded . I admit I 'm younger than you and have n't been around as much , or as long . But what has your first husband got to do with Wilmer seeing Veronique ? I fail to see any connection . MARY LEONARD Maybe Townsend sees a connection . TOWNSEND RINGWALD I do . But I 'm not going to let Veronique see him . EARL FISHER I 'm still as much in the dark . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Morgan Hanscom got into trouble , over money , and he committed suicide . Now Mary does n't want Wilmer to commit suicide . MARY LEONARD I do n't think he will commit suicide . But his life now is going to be very different from the life in prison . I think he 's one of the few people that prison did some good for . I know , I know , he 's a better person for having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very important to him . p. 146 TOWNSEND RINGWALD How could you tell all that from talking to him over the phone ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( interrupting ) : I 'll see him . TOWNSEND RINGWALD Of course you wo n't . I wo n't let you . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I 'd love to see him . MARY LEONARD ( shrewdly ) : You want to destroy what 's left , is that it ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You 're very smart , Mary . Yes , that 's what I want to do . I 've been thinking how awful it 's going to be , having him here in the same town . My first impulse was to go away , as soon as I heard he was here . But I 've been thinking it over , and I 'd love to see him . EARL FISHER Well , you can be sure Mary is n't going to let you , not on those terms . MARY LEONARD You 're quite wrong . I want them to see each other , on any terms . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him to ask her forgiveness . ERIC FABER Why , Mary ? MARY LEONARD Because this way it 's a vacuum , his life . But if he can see her , even if she refuses to forgive him , he 's going to keep trying , and as long as he 's trying , he 's living . Not living in a vacuum . And I know Veronique better than any of you do . p. 147 EARL FISHER Better than Veronique knows Veronique , no doubt . MARY LEONARD In some ways , yes . In at least one way . EARL FISHER Oh , dear . You frighten us . You know us all better than we know ourselves ? MARY LEONARD In some cases there is n't very much to know . When will you see him ? When can I bring him here ? I wo n't stay , but let me come with him and then disappear . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Tomorrow . The sooner the better . CURTAIN p. 148 Act 3 , Scene 3 SCENE THREE VERONIQUE RINGWALD 'S apartment , the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid admits MARY and WILMER HIGHTOWER . They enter the living-room and remain standing , awkwardly . WILMER is wearing the shabby suit given to paroled prisoners . He is definitely much older , calmer . He is wearing steel-rimmed glasses , a solid blue necktie , a wrinkled white shirt . He goes delightedly to the grand piano , runs his fingers soundlessly across the keyboard . He looks about the room , enjoying the touches of luxury . He stands in front of the portable bar , picks up a bottle of brandy , sniffs it , smiles , puts it back on the bar . His inspection of the apartment is pleasurable but at the same time remote ; he has seen nothing like all this in nine years , and he is rediscovering it without participation in it . He and MARY do not converse ; they await VERONIQUE 'S entrance . VERONIQUE now enters from a hallway off Left , and MARY is immediately startled by VERONIQUE 'S costume . It is so out of style and does not fit too well , and MARY accurately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCullough the night she was murdered . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Hello , Mary . Wilmer . Will you sit down  --  or Mary , you said you were n't staying . Wilmer understands that , does n't he ? p. 149 MARY LEONARD Yes . I have my car downstairs . I could wait there , or if you would n't mind , I have quite a few phone calls to make . Could I go back to Townsend 's study ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Yes , he 's not using it . MARY LEONARD I know that . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH All right . You know where everything is , and you can ring if you want a drink or coffee or anything . MARY LEONARD Thank you . She goes to RINGWALD 'S study . When she has gone VERONIQUE speaks . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Recognize my dress ? WILMER HIGHTOWER ( smiling ) : Not the dress , but I know it goes back a few years . We got the magazines up there . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( turning around ) : This one had a big rip in the back but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress is and what she is doing to him . WILMER HIGHTOWER I did n't remember the dress , Veronique . I guess I should have . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH It does n't surprise me , your forgetting . WILMER HIGHTOWER There is n't much I forgot . p. 150 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH There is n't anything I forgot . WILMER HIGHTOWER I understand that . I could tell , the way you looked at me at the trial , you were n't going to forget . You were n't going to let yourself forget . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH No , and I have n't . I know you 're not supposed to take a drink , but go ahead . I wo n't report you . WILMER HIGHTOWER No thanks . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Is n't that going to be pretty tough on you , especially now , when you can go in anywhere and have a drink ? No more Prohibition . WILMER HIGHTOWER I do n't think so . Of course I do n't know . But it 's so long since I 've had a drink , I do n't miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want that . WILMER HIGHTOWER Are you having some ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH No . WILMER HIGHTOWER Then I wo n't . May I offer you a cigarette ? ( He holds out a pack of Camels . ) VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I 'll wait . ( She waits only until he lights one for himself , then she takes one out of a silver box and lights it before he can . ) What did you want to see me about , Wilmer ? p. 151 WILMER HIGHTOWER Did n't Mary tell you ? Did n't she even give you a hint ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I have n't the slightest idea . WILMER HIGHTOWER ( incredulously ) : Veronique ? But what would I want to come here for ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH That 's what I 'm trying to find out . WILMER HIGHTOWER ( continuing his own thought ) : What 's the only thing I 'd want to see you for ? VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH ( unable to resist one more cruel shaft ) : I do n't know . She said you did n't want money . WILMER HIGHTOWER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate , a cake of soap , a new toothbrush . That 's what I 've been using money for , for the past nine years . I would n't know what to do with money if I had it . There 's only one thing I want , Veronique , and it does n't look as though I 'm going to get it . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH And what 's that ? WILMER HIGHTOWER What I 've been praying , the past five years . You used to be a Catholic , maybe you still are . Well , I 'm one now . I was converted about six years ago . This Father DuBois , he was the Catholic chaplain then , and they did n't have a Catholic to play the organ , so he asked me to . And I said I would , and one thing led to another and pretty soon I was taking instructions . I was baptized and confirmed a little over five years ago , and ever since then I had a special intention . You know what a special intention is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special intention . Your forgiveness. p. 152 VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH My forgiveness . WILMER HIGHTOWER The only thing I wanted to see you for , Veronique . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Well , your prayers were wasted . WILMER HIGHTOWER No prayers are wasted . If that is n't the way God wants it , I 'm not going to receive your forgiveness , but the prayers are n't wasted , Veronique . You know that . You do n't always get what you pray for , because it is n't always the will of God to grant it , but He hears your prayers . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH You 've studied your catechism all right . WILMER HIGHTOWER ( proudly ) : Ask me any question in the catechism . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH I learned my catechism in French . WILMER HIGHTOWER Well , ask me in English . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH No , you know all the answers . That 's you , you know all the answers . You always did . All the latest gossip , who was doing it to who . What kind of a man was your priest , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pronounced it that way . He was a good man . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH What else was he ? p. 153 WILMER HIGHTOWER He was n't one of us . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH Did n't you have any boy friends in prison ? WILMER HIGHTOWER Yes , at first . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH But you gave that up when you turned Catholic ? WILMER HIGHTOWER I tried to . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH But you did n't succeed . WILMER HIGHTOWER Yes , I finally succeeded . VERONIQUE MCCULLOUGH How long ago ? WILMER HIGHTOWER How long since I 've been with a man ?
