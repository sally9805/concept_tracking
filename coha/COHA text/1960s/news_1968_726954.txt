txt Washington , Feb. 24 - Both Johnson administration officials and the navy had some doubti at times before the first retaliatory air strikes against North Viet Nam as to just what happened in the Gulf of Tonkin on the night of Aug , 4 , 1964 . This was disclosed tonight in the release of the testimony of Secretary of Defense Robert ? before the Senate foreign relations committee last Tuesday . But told the committee that in the end the administration w a s " damned sure " a North Viet Nam attack had occurred . Captain Radios Message The testimony showed that Capt . John J. Herrick , who was in command of the two American destroyers , Maddox a n d Turner Joy , in the Gulf of Tonkin incident , radioed the following message to his superiors while President Johnson and his top aids were still considering whether to retaliate : " Review of action makes many recorded contacts and torpedoes fired appear doubtful . Freak weather effects and overeager sonar man may have accounted for many reports . No actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further action . " said that during the remaining hours before the air strike the administration and the Pentagon did satisfy themselves that an engagement had taken place in which North Vietnamese vessels did attack the two destroyers in international waters . Asserts All Share View That the Communists attacked " is the view of every one of the key senior civilian and military officials in the department , " testified . It was established during the hearing that a still highly secret intelligence report was a major factor for the immediate conclusion that the attack was bona fide said he would have made the same final evaluation without the report , however , based on other facts . Calls Adm . Sharp Herrick was on the Maddox . Asked by committee members about the administration reaction to Herrick 's message , replied : " What do you think we would do when we got it ? Well , obviously we were concerned , and we immediately began to examine it , and I have here a whole series of steps we took at that point as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharp U. S. Grant Sharp , top American commander in the Pacific and brought this to his attention and said we obviously do not want to carry out retaliatory action unless we are ' damned sure what happened . ' Those were the exact words . " The defense chief said that at one point Sharp himself was in doubt but amplified it further to say , " I do n't believe as to whether the attack had been made , but as to the character of the attack and the details of the attack ... " pointed out to the committee that Herrick 's message did not state that he questioned whether an attack had taken place but that many reported contacts and torpedoes fired appeared doubtful . Reports Visual Sightings An hour and 20 minutes after his message suggesting a complete evaluation , Herrick cabled Sharp that he was certain the ambush was bona fide because he had made positive visual sightings of cockpit lights or similar lights from North Vietnamese craft near the Maddox and that the Turner Joy , which was trailing the Maddox , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , the joint chiefs , and Undersecretary of Defense Cyrus Vance met for 21% hours " to determine , whether , in fact , an attack on the destroyers had occurred . " He said they reviewed particularly " the communications intelligence information we had available to us . " Meeting Convinces Him Sharp then notified from Honolulu that he was " fully assured the attack took place . " said that as a result of the 2 1/2 hour meeting he was convinced and that he released the executive order on the strike . During this time discussions also took place with the President and Secretary of State Dean Rusk . Chairman J. William Fulbright D. , Ark. of the foreign relations committee and some other dove members , including Senators Wayne Morse D. , Ore. and Albert Gore D. , Tenn. have long questioned the validity of the incident , which was used by the administration to get a congressional resolution in support of the retaliatory air strikes and further American military involvement in Viet Nam . The committee has completed its own staff study to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States provoked an attack because of its presence in the gulf during South Vietnamese navy operations against North Viet . Nam infiltrators . One thing the testimony brought out was that the committee staff does not have many of the details on which the administration acted because : The staff did not have a " special clearance above top secret " that is needed for certain vital papers . 2 . It was not supplied with information voluntarily by the administration that it did not ask for . Thru the staff study , the testimony disclosed , Fulbright and his anti-war colleagues are trying to establish that the administration was preparing to begin air strikes against North Viet Nam long before the Tonkin incident . The testimony revealed a sharp disagreement between Fulbright and over the purpose and operations of the destroyer patrol . Fulbright raised the issue of whether the United States was n't in fact asking for trouble in venturing near North Viet Nam 's coast . The defense chief and Fur bright and Morse had opposite views on whether the Ameri can vessels were working to gether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installa tions . Assume ** Limit On the issue of territoria waters , it was disclosed tha American vessels went a : close as 8 miles to the Null Viet Nam mainland and miles to two of its islands North Viet Nam claims a 12 mile limit to its territoria waters . But said the limit was not declared until after the Tonkin incident . said the United States was within its rights to approach within 8 and 4 miles because of this . He said the United States assumed that North Viet Nam had a 3-mile limit because Indo-China before it had a 3-mile limit and North Viet Nam had never announced a change . Morse charged that the patrol was simply a decoy in connection with the South Vietnamese naval operations , known as 34-A operations . At issue in this controversy with were three naval orders disclosed during the testimony . One , a cable to the Maddox , said in part that the destroyer patrol would " possibly draw NVM that is North Vietnamese navy PGMS patrol boats to northward away from the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flatly denied that the Maddox and Turner Joy were trying to pull North Viet Nam patrol boats away . The second order directed the destroyer patrol to pull farther away from South Vietnamese operations . said the order was clearly given to keep the two operations separate . Morse said it w a s issued to coordinate the two operations . A third order was a cable from the commander in chief in the pacific that authorized his fleet units involved in the destroyer patrol to contact American headquarters in Saigon for information on - ' 34-A operations . Gore said this showed coordination . But said it was very relevant to the situation that the cable did not go to the Maddox but to fleet commanders so they could direct the Maddox and Turner Joy away from 34-A operations without the two destroyers being aware of what was going on . Apparently basing his question on information in the committee 's staff study , Fulbrighl asked to comment on the statement of a captured North Vietnamese navy squad . Iron commander that there had been " no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 attack . Has " No Knowledge " said in the first place t h e officer referred to was not a squadron commander and that , according to 's recollection , the prisoner had said he had " no knowledge " of the Aug. 4 attack . The secretary then said that last July a North Vietnamese naval officer " of some rank " had been captured and had given the name of the squadron commander in charge of the Aug. 2 attack . That officer 's boat number was the same as one reported to have participated in the Aug. 4 attack , said . said . in defense of the destroyer patrol , that the North Vietnamese were aware of its nature and that it was operating Independently of South Vietnamese naval operations in the area . In one exchange with , Fulbright asked why the United States found it ' necessary to launch a retaliation against North Viet Nam " so completely disproportionate to the offense , . " " I do not believe it was disproportionate to the offense , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States naval vessels operating on the high seas in an entirely legal fashion . " One of the attacks occurred after a warning from the President thai we would continue to operate in those waters in a legal fashion and that a further attack would have grave consequences . " The American attack itself was very limited in character . It was direbted against the attacking boats and their petroleum facility . It was not followed by any further action . " Fulbright noted that 64 missions , with 59 planes , were flown . He said he considered that action as " very vigorous " rather than " limited . " " It is a limited response , " said , " because we attacked such low-value targets as the bases of the PT boats instead of the much-more important military targets that lay within the range of those 64 flight paths . " Fulbright then wanted to know why the issue was not taken to the United Nations . " We had no reason to believe the United Nations could have acted in any effective manner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
