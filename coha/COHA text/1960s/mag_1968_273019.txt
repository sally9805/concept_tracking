Whenever the West begins to relax about Berlin , the Communists have a jarring way of reminding everyone that it is still there , and still vulnerable . Though crises flare and die elsewhere in the world , Berlin , where the cold war began , remains a constant pressure point , always susceptible to fresh Communist maneuvers . <P> Isolated deep within hostile East Germany , West Berlin depends for survival upon its right of free access to West Germany . Last week that right suddenly acquired a price . In a swift move , the regime of Communist Boss Walter Urbricht forced all West German and West Berlin travelers through East Germany to buy transit visas at $2.50 a round trip . After July 1 , truckers and bargers will be required to pay new taxes on their cargoes , and after July 15 all West German travelers will be required to carry passports ( in the past they needed only identity cards ) . In all , the East Germans will collect some $20 million per year in fees on the 13 water , rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Walter Ulbricht was not really interested in revenue . The move seemed intended primarily to underscore East Germany 's claim that it is a sovereign nation . It was also likely that Ulbricht , as the East bloc 's last surviving Stalinist , hoped that a new Berlin crisis might induce a show of comradely support in Eastern Europe , dampening the trends toward liberalism in Czechoslovakia and Rumania . Since it was his third move in recent months against West Berlin 's access routes , Ulbricht also obviously hoped to shake the city 's self-confidence and discourage foreign investors . <P> The Danger of Reasonableness . On receiving the news , West German Foreign Minister Willy Brandt , the former mayor of West Berlin , hurried back from Vienna . Ironically , he had been on his way to Belgrade to seek President Tito 's support for West Germany 's new policy of easing tensions with the East bloc . In Bonn , Chancellor Kurt Kiesinger held an emergency Cabinet session . In Paris , London and Washington , the allies , who guarantee West Berlin 's security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to do nothing , aside from making a few perfunctory gestures . Kiesinger flew in a U.S. Air Force plane to West Berlin , where he promised that the Bonn government would pick up the tab for the East German transit charges , and the three allies sent a protest to the Soviets , whom they hold responsible for the maintenance of free access to West Berlin . <P> The allies were reluctant to take any retaliatory action , such as refusing to grant travel documents to East Germans for trips to NATO countries , because the East Germans had carefully left U.S. , British and French access rights untouched . For its part , the West German government was unwilling to hit Ulbricht where it would hurt him most-restricting inter-German trade-since that would also hurt the average East German . Kurt Kiesinger 's Grand Coalition is committed to a policy of trying to make life easier , not harder , for the East German population . Furthermore , because of the partial success of its new Ostpolitik , Bonn does not want to lose friends in Communist countries by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger of such a low-key response was that Ulbricht might be emboldened to undertake some new move to tighten the noose that he holds around West Berlin .
