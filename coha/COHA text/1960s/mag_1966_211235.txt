The White House was in near bedlam last week as staffers struggled against time to complete arrangements for the President 's Far Eastern swing . If for no other reason , it was an ideal time for Lyndon Johnson to hit the campaign trail , and so he did - with a bang . Displaying all the old evangelistic fervor of his 1964 campaign , the President made a fast-paced overnight foray into Maryland , New York and Delaware , at week 's end prepared for a brief , last-minute appearance in Pennsylvania . <P> Through it all , he was fiercely partisan , unashamedly folksy - and , for a change , refreshingly natural . <P> Making a supposedly " nonpolitical " speech before a crowd of 20,000 at Social Security headquarters near Baltimore , the President outlined a cannily timed proposal for across-the-board boosts of " at least 10% " for all 22 million Social Security beneficiaries . Sharing a platform with local party bigwigs ( notably absent : Open-Housing Foe George P. Mahoney , Maryland 's Democratic gubernatorial nominee ) , the President chose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the Democratic Party symbol . " Any donkey can kick down a barn , " he said , " but it takes a skilled carpenter to build one . There 's a big donkey population in this country around this time of year . " <P> " Afraid , Afraid ! " Though Johnson dislikes New York and recoils from its politics , he nonetheless flew in to stump for Democratic Challenger Frank O'Connor , whose campaign to unseat Governor Nelson Rockefeller is in trouble . The President , who was criticized last year for withholding support for New York City 's Democratic mayoral candidate until the last moment , realized that if he stayed away this time and O'Connor and other Democratic candidates lost , the White House would be blamed . Worse yet perhaps , if O'Connor won , much of the credit would go to Senator Robert Kennedy . <P> Plunging zealously into Bobby 's bailiwick , the President campaigned with Kennedy at his side , even heralded him as " one of the greatest Senators in all New York history . " But it was Lyndon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.B.J. lunged gleefully into the throngs that lined the motorcade route . On Staten Island , he bellowed at 3,000 partisans that Democratic programs-Medicare , antipoverty , education-had been enacted over the opposition of fearful Republicans . " Afraid , afraid , afraid ! " chanted Johnson . " Republicans are afraid of their own shadows and afraid of the shadow of progress " -a taunt that prompted Everett Dirksen , the Senate 's Republican leader and Johnson 's sometime congressional ally , to wonder : " Is the President bewildered ? " <P> That night , after a brief appearance at a Columbus Day parade on Manhattan 's Fifth Avenue , Johnson made an eloquent plea for interracial understanding at a Brooklyn gathering of Italian-American businessmen . Reminding his audience that Italian immigrants had once experienced " the raw pain of discrimination " that is felt by Negroes today , L.B.J. added : " I ask those of you who have crossed the river to extend to them a helping hand .
