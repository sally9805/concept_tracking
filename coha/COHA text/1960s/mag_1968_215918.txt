The patient who seemed to get along best with his transplanted heart was former Dentist Philip Blaiberg in Cape Town , Dr. Barnard 's second recipient . Eleven days after the operation , Blaiberg , 58 , was sitting on the edge of his bed and swinging his legs like a schoolboy . This was not mere bravado , but was designed to help his circulation . He drank a " shandy " ( beer and lemonade ) and sang a Brahms lullaby . <P> Then Blaiberg hit some snags . When he developed a sore throat , his doctors were relieved to find no evidence of bacterial infection . They decided that a virus was to blame and prescribed a simple gargle . Next , too much fluid accumulated in the sac around Blaiberg 's new heart , as may happen after cardiac surgery of any type . This necessitated puncturing the sac to drain it . After that , Blaiberg said he felt much better , and the doctors felt confident enough to reduce his already moderate doses of immunosuppressive drugs .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
