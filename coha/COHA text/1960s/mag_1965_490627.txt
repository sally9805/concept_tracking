THE TALK , OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment " I N one respect a cavalry charge is very like ordinary life . So long as you are all right , firmly in your saddle , your horse in hand , and well armed , lots of enemies will give you a wide berth . But as soon as you have lost a stirrup , have a rein cut , have dropped your weapon , are wounded , or your horse is wounded , then is the moment when from all quarters enemies rush upon you . " When Winston Churchill wrote these lines , in " My Early Life , " he wrote with authority , because he had taken part in the charge that the 21st Lancers made against the Dervish army at Omdurman , in the Sudan , on September 2 , 1898 . He wrote with feeling , because in 1930 , the year " My Early Life " was published , he was in the political wilderness , without horse or stirrups . And he wrote with the knowledge that the fighting he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaigns was of a sporting kind that was unrepeatable . " Most of us were fated to see a war where the hazards were reversed , where death was the general expectation and severe wounds were counted as lucky escapes , where whole brigades were shorn away under the steel flail of artillery and machine-guns , where the survivors of one tornado knew that they would certainly he consumed in the next or the next after that . " Something else he knew was himself  --  infuriating , unquenchable , almost always right . " I was a child of the Victorian era , when the structure of our country seemed firmly set , when its position in trade and on the seas was unrivalled , and when the realisation of the greatness of our Empire and of our duty to preserve it was ever growing stronger . In those days the dominant forces in Great Britain were very sure of themselves and of their doctrines . They thought they could teach the world the art of government , and the science of economics . They were sure they were supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore sedately under the convictions of power and security . Very different is the aspect of these anxious and dubious times . " Nine years later , in the most dubious time of all , the child of the Victorian era was offered his horse again , though its reins were cut . He met the enemies rushing upon him from all quarters and met them with nineteenth-century conviction , with up-to-date organization and strategy , and with  --  what was perhaps most important  --  a fierce enjoyment . For it was n't simply the sense of hearing again the voice of Chatham , of Shakespeare 's Henry V , of immemorial heroes , that warmed the blood of the tired steed of England . It was the instinctive knowledge that this man , from a line of British dukes and American revolutionaries , was a champion who meant to win , and who would , therefore , win . In the worst moments , when the Ifitlerian holocaust seemed nearly certain to consume the whole world , Churchill , by his every phrase , gesture , grumble , and smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he , for one , was wide-awake , and that , in the midst of evil , life continued to have good things . He was one of the very best of them . Now the great man is gone . The last , long cavalry charge is over , and we live in a lesser time . Ship Shopping WE went up to the Fifty-fifth National Motor Boat Show , at the Coliseum , last week and found the main floor all but covered with beached shipping and looking pretty much the way Portofino would if somebody pulled the plug . Motorboats and cabin cruisers nuzzled the central corridor as though it were a pier , and the sails on the yachts lulled gaily or flapped gently in the breeze generated by hucksters . There were occasional men in blue blazers and yachting caps , and occa-sional children in sailor suits . Clamber-ing aboard a forty-two-foot motor cruiser called the BayHead Skiff Can-yon Commuter , the costliest boat in the show , we found ourself face to face with Mr. Percy Hall , assistant manager of the BayHead Skiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall was something of a reverse pirate , for he tried to unload the giant skiff on us  --  or , rather , a ghostly , hy-pothetical sister skiff , to be made to order , for the one we were on had al-ready been sold . " All our boats are cus-tom-made , " Mr. Hall said . " We design to suit the customer . " We asked Mr. Hall to demonstrate how BayHead Skiff put this maxim into practice , and he led the way down to the saloon , which was full of sleek leather chairs . " Look at the wood panelling ! " he said . " It 's koa , from Hawaii , and karina , from Nigeria . The table is rosewood and the floors are holly . The customer has ninety-five thousand dollars in this boat , and we 're not through with him yet . " We hastened ashore , wandered about to re-gain our financial hearings , and finally , on the fourth floor , paused before a long , sleek dark-green powerboat called the Donzi Hornet , which looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in general , that boats are becoming more and more like cars . ) The Donzi Hornet costs eight thousand dollars and can do better than seventy miles an hour . " We offer instant kingship to the man who buys it , " Allan Brown , the Donzi operative , said proudly . " He 's automatically the fastest guy at the yacht club . " We descended a series of moving companionways to the ground floor and pulled up at the yards of the Fisher-Pierce Company , makers of Boston Whalers  --  puffy , snub-nosed little Fiberglas barges . ( Wood , we learned , is as outmoded in boats as it is in cars . ) " The Boston Whaler is the Volkswagen of the boat business , " the yards ' operative said . " Boston Whalers never change . They 're unsinkable . " We moved on to the marina of Kayot , which bills itself as " World Leader in Pontoon Funcraft , " and inspected a Kayot Captain  --  a sort of raft on a pair of steel pontoons , with a canopy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mr. Richard Eagen , the cheerful skipper of the Funcraft . " You can have cocktail parties on it . We had a couple get married on one of our pontoon boats . " Having skirted a number of powerboats with huge automotive tail fins , we decided to try our luck on another floor , where we discussed a flotilla of Fiberglas kayaks with their captain , who represented the Klepper Corporation , the New York subsidiary of a German firm . " We 're doing a land-office business up North , selling them to Eskimos , " he said . Farther along , we almost stumbled over a Sea Dart  --  a tiny Fiberglas motorboat , only eighty-two inches long , which , like a small rubber raft , is ridden stomach down , legs dragging in the water . It is powered by a twenty-two-horsepower engine and can do thirty miles an hour . " You feel as though you had a rocket by the tail , " Nicholas Mielcarek , salesman for Sea Dart , said . " It has a &adman's; switch , so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the third floor to look at tackle , gear , and accessories , which turned nut to be mostly of plastic . At Teleflex-Ongaro , manufacturers of marine products , we hove to and examined some steering wheels for boats . " Some are made of tcnitc huterate , just like automobile steering wheels , " Roy Bergey , helmsman for Teleflex-Ongaro , said . " We also manufacture power-steering units , throttle and clutch controls , and instrument panels  --  in short , we have everything for the binnacle , which means dashboard . " At the Atlantic-Pacific Manufacturing Corporation 's stall , we inspected a variety of life preservers : circular type , jacket type , and the newest type of all  --  a sort of horse collar made of plastic . " Polyvinyl-chloride is as buoyant as cork , " the salesman said . " For a long soak , give me plastic every time . " We upped anchor and headed for the Industrial Timer Corporation , dispensers of air horns , where the operative invited us to listen to a tape recording of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blaring note  --  a hundred and seventeen decibels . The horn runs on twenty-two pounds of air pressure and will make someone a mile away jump . Next , we consulted Mr. William H. Gardiner , vender of Z-Spar marine and anti-fouling paints that are guaranteed to discourage barnacles and borers . " The paint sets up a poisoning action in the water and keeps exuding a leaching type of toxin -- tributal tin oxide if the paint is red or yellow , or cuprous oxide if the paint is one of our blues or greens , " Mr. Gardiner said . " As far as we know , it wo n't poison fish , but the Department of Agriculture is checking . " ? Ve turned our attention to rope at the Samson Cordage Works , and learned from the sales manager , Mr. Robert Billings , that hemp is out and Dacron , nylon , and polyethylene are in . " Dacron rope is expensive but low on stretch . Nylon is cheaper but stretches more . Polyethylene is cheapest but poor on abrasion , " Mr. Billings said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea chanty . He continued , " Samson braided rope is the Cadillac of ropes . We 've outfitted the last three America 's Cup defenders . Samson rope slings are used in space-capsule recovery . Our rope helped fish John Glenn out of the drink . " He gave us a sample of line , and not far away we found an anchor to put on the end of it . " Our anchors are nine ways better than any others , " Jerry E. Jensen , of the BrewerTichener Corporation , said . " There 's a patented crossarm , so that whichever way you throw the anchor over the side , the flukes are guaranteed to hit the bottom at a fighting , thirtyfive-degree angle in a downward , attack position . There 's immediate penetration of the bottom . No drag . " When in Rome AN Orient-minded Manhattan couple recently invited a newly landed Japanese graduate student to what he gratefully informed them was his first dinner party in an American home . The young man proved to be extremely mannerly , and it was clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in fact , his only lapse , if it can be called that , came when , acting on his host 's suggestion that he might like to wash up before eating , he went into the bathroom and took a shower . Foss BUFFALO , which we have always tended to think of as a nice city to live in but no place to visit , has taken on a whole new cultural aura for us as the result of a half hour 's brisk chat we 've had with Lukas Foss , the composer . Mr. Foss , who is now in his second season as conductor and musical director of the Buffalo Philharmonic , was in town to deliver a " lecture-concert " at Hunter College , during which two of his latest compositions were to be performed . Catching him one afternoon between rehearsals and other appointments , we picked him up at his hotel and accompanied him around the corner to a coffeehouse on West Fifty-sixth Street , where he asked for a table as far away from the canned music as possible . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable flowering of the arts in his adopted city . " Things are really lively in Buffalo , " he told us . " You would hardly believe all that 's going on . Of course , there is the Albright-Knox Gallery , which everybody knows about , and which attracts the artists , but now the State University of Buffalo has started to attract the writers and poets , and the Philharmonic is doing all sorts of things  --  new things  --  that interest the musicians . On top of which , we have our new Center for Creative and Performing Arts , and in February we are putting on the Buffalo Festival of Arts . Do you know about that ? Ionesco is coming over from Paris to put on three of his plays , and there will he a great exhibition of kinetic art , and heaven only knows what else . I 've scheduled a week of concerts devoted exclusively to the music of the last ten years . Not even Schoenberg , mind you  --  just the last ten years . That 's really revolutionary ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J 1 - 1K 13 and Mr. Foss , who is forty-two and rather slight , with boyish features and chronically dishevelled dark hair , leaned back and gave her a dazzling smile . He ordered a cappuccino , we did the same , and the waitress retreated , blushing . More or less at random , we asked Mr. Foss to tell us about the Center for Creative and Performing Arts . " That was really my idea , carried out in association with Allen Sapp , who is chairman of the university 's Music Department , " he said " You see , we have many composers now who are creating a totally new kind of music , but so few musicians know how to play it . This music is terrifically difficult , too  --  more difficult than any music has ever been before . We really need to have the performer work with us in creating it . And so , under a **27;2945;TOOLONG grant from the Rockefeller Foundation , plus a third of that added by the university , we have selected twenty musicians from all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are performing this new music . " " How were they selected ? " we asked . " Were they students " Absolutely not , " Mr. Foss replied . " The whole point was to take people who were mature musically  --  real virtuosi  --  and conquer them for our cause . Some arc quite well known . There is Don Ellis , the American trumpet player , and Sylvann Bussotti , a much discussed Italian composer , and Jean DuPouih , who is one of the finest viola players in France . It 's a fabulous group , and to get them all together in a city like Buffalo  --  well , it changes the character of the place . They live in town , not at the university , and the grant is generous enough to make it fairly comfortable living . There are no classes , no rigid schedule . It 's a very American setup , and our Europeans find it highly stimulating . They are giving performances first at the Albright-Knox and then at Carnegie Recital Hall , in New York  --  four ' Evenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecture-concert at Hunter College . " Backtracking a bit , we asked Mr. Foss to tell us about himself . " I was born in Berlin and raised in Paris , but I came here when I was barely fifteen and I consider myself completely American , " he said . " I studied music in Paris , Berlin , Philadelphia at the Curtis Institute of Mu-sic  --  and at Yale , under Hindemith . All this time , I was composing tonal music  --  the music I grew up with . And I loved that music , too . Then , about six or seven years ego , at U.C.L.A. , where I succeeded Schoenberg as Professor of Composition , I started a series of experiments in improvisation . It all began very modestly , as a means of helping the students , but suddenly a door opened for me , and I saw a vast new territory to explore . Now I 'm not even very close to improvisation anymore . I let my students do that . I 'm too busy composing . " Recalling that Mr. Foss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1961 for his " Time Cycle , " a work for soprano , chamber ensemble , and orchestra that contained elements of aleatory , or chance , composition , we asked what part chance played in his more recent works . " Well , let 's take Echoi , ' " he said . " Echoi ' is probably one of the most difficult pieces of chamber music ever written ; it is performed by four players , who occupy the whole stage with their various instruments  --  percussion , cello , piano , and clarinet  --  and it does contain certain aleatory- , or indeterminate , elements , but it is carefully notated throughout  --  that is , the improvisational tasks are so carefully described that the composition does not surrender to chance . I call it ' precise . elasticity . ' I 'm very reluctant , you see , not to know what 's going to happen . Let me put it like this : I feel that the way to advance into the new musical territory is to advance rcarfirst , waving to the disappearing past  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , the tonality I loved . But I also want to know where I 'm going . " He paused , smiled , and continued , " The trouble is they keep me too busy conducting now . In May and June , for instance , I 'm going to conduct at three European festivals -- Zagreb , Palermo , and Berlin . I 've also undertaken to put on the French-American Festival at Lincoln Center this July . That Festival is really significant ; it 's the first time New York has put on something in the summer that is n't just light , that is more like the European idea of a festival . And then next season I 'm scheduled to he guest conductor of the New York Philharmonic for four weeks . It 's on much . I 'll have to put a stop to it . " ? Ve inquired how Buffalo 's regular music public had reacted so far to the new music that the Buffalo Philharmonic had been playing under his direction . " We get away with it only because the bulk of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is a very beautiful orchestra , though , and because it is now playing a lot of new music  --  contemporary music it is also playing Beethoven better , as though the ink were not yet dry on the score . Of course , the reaction to the new music is not always favorable . We gave the American premiere of Karlheinz Stockhausen 's ' Momente ' in Buffalo last year , and the storm over that is still raging . Letters just poured in to the newspapers asking what I thought I was doing . I finally had to go on television to defend myself . The letters were flashed on the screen behind me , an invisible voice read them , and then I had to answer their criticism . I suppose the city is about evenly divided . The fact is I 'm in what amounts to an invulnerable position . If they want to get rid of me , that 's fine ; I 'm a composer-conductor , so I do n't rely exclusively on conducting . " It was time for Mr. Foss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sidewalk , and he hurried off at a good clip , turning around in a final salutation that had him , for a moment , unmistakably advancing rearfirst and waving . ?
