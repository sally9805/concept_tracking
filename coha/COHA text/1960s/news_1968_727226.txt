txt " Conflict of interest " is becoming an increasingly sticky problem for top corporate executives . Some prudent men have been startled and angered to find themselves on the spot . The reason : Regulatory agencies and the courts are forcing a sterner interpretation of guidelines governing the conduct of influential executives . They reason that such guidelines are needed to protect stockholders and the public and to insure free competition . Most in jeopardy are men holding directorships at companies that may be competitive , however slightly , and executives with ties to suppliers or customers . ExecUtives who personally own real estate leased to their companies also are under sharper scrutiny . Under the Clayton Antitrust Act , the Justice Department regularly has challenged instances where a man served as a director at two companies that were in direct and substantial competition . But , in private negotiations over a period of months and in a public statement last month , the department has made clear that it is broadening its interpretation of the ban to include companies where the competition may be relatively minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named 16 big companies , including the three big auto makers and several major oil companies , whose board memberships it had challenged . In each case , it charged , a director was serving competitive corporations . The companies consider the competition involved to be negligible . But , with suits threatened , the directors cited have resigned one or the other of the posts . The challenges clearly signaled a tougher Government policy . But the action simply accelerated the already rising risk executives face of being charged with conflict of interest . The trend toward corporate diversification and conglomerates has steadily made competitors out of more and more companies . One high executive sees it this way : " You can hardly sit on anyone else 's board now without discovering that if they do n't already make widgets that compete with your company 's , they 're about to buy a widget maker . " Another aspect of the conflict problem , relationships of major commercial banks to companies , was underscored Monday by Rep. Patman ( D. , Tex. ) , chairman of the House Banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Patman urged antitrust actions against " thousands " of interlocking stockholdings and directorships involving banks and corporations . There is another factor : Executives are feeling pressure for high standards of ethics from within and without business . " There is no question that the general level of morality expected of corporate officials has been steadily rising in recent years , " says Louis Loss , a professor at Harvard law school . " This is inevitably being reflected in the law . " Angry Businessman The scope of the Justide Department 's attack on interlocking directorates is suggested by one of its targets last month , Paul C. Cabot . Mr. Cabot , chairman of State Street Investment Corp. , a Boston mutual fund organization , has been a director both at Ford Motor Co. and B. F. Goodrich Co . Ford , of course , concentrates on cars , and Goodrich on tires , but both companies also sell minor items such as spare plugs , batteries az.1 lubricants . The competitive items amount to about 0.4% in sales for Ford and about 1% for Goodrich . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fumes Mr. Cabot , who considers the Justice Department action " just a lot of damn hogwash . " Mr. Cabotwas irked also because the department did n't contact him personally but went to lawyers at Goodrich and Ford . " I never heard that I was breaking the law , " he says . " I have n't heard a bloody word from them ( the Government ) yet . " Some lawyers involved also feel the sales are too insignificant to merit action . They point out that the companies ' sales of the products in question account for minor portions of the total market . The Justice Department threatened to sue anyway . Its statement last month acknowledged that the sales in question are " a relatively minor part of the total business of the companies . " Not Worth the Trouble Mr. Cabot is leaving his Goodrich seat . As it happens , he would have to retire soon because of a company age limit of 70 for directors . " Some friends urge me to fight the Government , " he says , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure doing that when I have to quit anyway ? " Equally startled were the targets of another Justice Department action , Halle Brothers Co. department store of Cleveland , and Gray Drug Stores Inc. , also of Cleveland . Both sell cosmetics , but they claim to be noncompetitive , with Halle offering high-priced items and Gray concentrating on lower-priced , mass market items . " We were n't in competition with the drugstores , " says Eugene Roth , senior vice president at Halle . Jerome A. Weinberger , president of Gray , asserts , " We do n't consider them competition ; we complement each other . " The Justice Department felt they were competitive enough to merit action . The common director , George F. Karch , president of Cleveland Trust Co. , resigned from the Gray board several months ago after the Government made clear its intention of trying to force him to end one affiliation . Corporate diversification has forced a number of resignations by directors . Last year , for example , Litton Industries bought a book publisher , American Book Co . Litton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a director at the Times Mirror Co. , which owns a book publishing division besides publishing the Los Angeles Times newspaper . The Times Mirror elected Walter Annenberg , president of Triangle Publications in Philsarielphia , to fill the empty seat . But within days of the election  --  before Mr. Annenberg had attended a meeting  --  the Justice Department fired off a letter challenging the move . Checking in Advance This time the objection was that the Los Angeles Times publishes TV Times in its Sunday issue , while Triangle publishes TV Guide . The two magazines are competitive , the Government maintained . Mr. Annenberg promptly resigned from the Times Mirror board . To avoid such problems , lawyers at many companies are routinely checking the affiliations of prospective directors , and sometimes they veto suggested board members . Early this year , for example , Armour &; Co. announced in a proxy statement that J. Harris Ward , chairman of Commonwealth Edison Co. , Chicago , was a nominee for an Armour directorship . But Mr. Ward is a director of International Harvester Co . Harvester 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaders , and so does Armour , through the Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton subsidiary acquired in 1965 . Ten days before the Armour annual meeting Armour announced that Mr. Ward " felt compelled to withdraw his candidacy because of a conflict of interest . " Conflict of interest is making it increasingly tough to get and keep directors , some companies assert . " We want men of intelligence and stature on our board , and this conflict situation is making it extremely difficult , " says Abram T. Collier , president of New England Mutual Life Insurance Co . New England Life may lose a director soon for just that reason , Mr. Collier says . He is John Cooper , a trustee of Massachusetts Investors Trust who also holds other top posts in the huge MIT mutual fund complex . The reason : New England Life recently entered the mutual field too , through the acquisition of Loomis-Sayles &; Co. , which manages three funds . Plucking From Inside Mr. Collier predicts that companies " more and more often " will turn to " inside " directors to avoid the conflict problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty by Mr. Ward 's withdrawal , Armour elected Clifton B. Cox , a company group vice president . The higher level of ethics expected of corporate officials has been spotlighted by the New York Stock Exchange , among others . In a pamphlet on directors ' duties published in 1965 , the exchange focused particularly on executives who mix personal real estate transactions with company business and executives who have links to customers or suppliers . " In the experience of the exchange , " the pamphlet reads , " conflict of interest problems involving officers and directors most frequently concern the direct or indirect ownership of property leased to the company ( or ) sales or purchases of goods or services to or from organizations in which an officer has a material . . . interest .. . . Generally speaking , relationships of this nature are undesirable . " In the steel industry , for instance , it has long been common for iron ore executives to sit on the boards of steel companies they supply with ore . But Los Angeles financier Norton Simon challenged this practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steel Corp . A Court Suit Conditions at Wheeling , Mr. Simon charged , had been " significantly based on vendor-directors working with management-directors for the best interests of each with only incidental regard to the interests of stockholders . " This arrangement , he said , " when coupled with a vendor-centered , inadequately planned and covertly underfinanced modernization program was leading the company to absolute and inevitable destruction . " Wheeling already had cited specifics in a Federal di.saict court suit filed several weeks earlier against Harms Mining Co. and Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co . The suit charged that the two ore-mining firms NI/xi:tired to monopolize the ore market and fix prices . Wheeling said it had lost more than $48 million because of inflated prices , and it sued for treble damages , $144 million . As one method of carrying out the conspiracy , Wheeling charged , the ore companies had top executives obtain seats on the Wheeling board . " The officers of defendants serving as Wheeling 's directors were individuals highly knowledgeable in the iron ore industry , with particular knowledge regarding the pricing system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " By reason of the confidence placed by the management of Wheeling in defendants ' representatives on its board , Wheeling was lulled into the belief that the prices which it was paying for iron ore were legal and proper , and failed to make investigations which otherwise would have been made to determine how such prices were set . " The suit did n't name the directors , but Walter Marling , president of Hanna , was on the Wheeling board at the time , as was Walter Sterling , retired chairman of Cleveland Cliffs and still a director of that company . Both defendant companies have denied the allegations ; the case has n't come to trial . A Real Estate Deal The question of executives ' personal dealings in real estate that also involve their companies has arisen in a case involving BairdAtomic Inc. , a Cambridge , Mass. , maker of nuclear , spectrochemical and electronic instruments . In 1964 , Walter Baird , chairman of BairdAtomic , personally bought the building in Cambridge where the company has headquarters and various facilities . The price was $300,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the estate of the deceased former owner . Mr. Baird later raised the rent and the terms of a lease with the company , increasing Baird-Atomic 's annual costs to $118,000 from about $68,000 . Company directors and stockholders approved the changes . Meanwhile , plans had been announced for erecting the John F. Kennedy Library on adjacent land , enhancing real estate values . According to a company proxy statement , Baird-Atomic owns land next to Mr , Baird 's personally held property , and the company plus Mr. Baird have entered into an agreement with RDA Corp. , a real estate developer . Plans have been announced to build a $20 million complex of offices and apartments . The agreement signs over the company 's and Mr. Baird 's land to RDA . In return , Baird-Atomic gets land and a new plant RDA is building for it in Weston , Mass. , and Mr. Baird agrees to swap his property  --  bought for $300,000 ? for other revenue-producing property or for about $1.5 million in cash . Three minority stockholders at BairdAtomic are suing in Massachusetts Superior Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiduciary obligations to the company , appropriated to himself a valuable corporate opportunity and took no real economic risk in the deals . Mr. Baird denies wrongdoing , saying that the former owner of the land allowed him to buy it only because of a close personal relationship . Another Baird-Atomic executive says three Boston law firms that checked the transactions found them " perfectly legal . "
