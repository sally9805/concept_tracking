" This is the world 's greatest picture from the world 's greatest book , " says the reigning flack , as he watches 3,500 body-tanned extras toiling with baskets of plastic bricks up the staircases and setbacks of the Tower of Babel on the set south of Rome . " Here , " says the associate producer , " you have the first love story , the first sin , the first murder , the first boat and the first skyscraper . " " All these fantastic stories , " marvels the prime mover of all , Italian Producer Dino de Laurentiis , " it would be incredible if it were n't the Bible . " <P> It is the Bible , and all the more incredible for being so . When De Laurentiis first embarked on his epic , he envisioned a ten-hour film , costing $25 million and depicting nearly all the still waters and flaming furnaces , from Creation to Gethsemane . When he actually started shooting the picture in Rome last May , he had boiled it down to a mere three-hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Christopher Fry writing the script and a cast of a dozen stars , including Ava Gardner , as the Mother of the Jews , and John Huston , who plays Noah and also directs the film . <P> Floating Zoo . Last week Huston was functioning furiously in both guises . As Noah , with a full grey beard and wearing a coarse beige tunic , he was striding up and down the gangplank of the $300,000 ark made of roughhewn logs . As director , he moved inside the 200-ft. - long , 60-ft. - high ark-one of five to be used in the film-to supervise 200 animals that had been brought down over the Alps from Althoffs Circus and were undergoing their first try at bedding down . <P> The din below decks was strident . <P> Two honey bears started fighting and stampeded the camels , tethered opposite the elephants . Noah 's son Japheth , played by one of Althoff 's animal trainers , was using baby talk to soothe a pair of lions and Siberian tigers in their glassed-in cages . Elsewhere in the hold , zebras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellowed . But the real test is yet to come . This week the whole zoo , accompanied by some 1,000 birds , will make its way up the gangplank , two by two . " My God , " groaned Huston , " how the hell did Noah do it ? " <P> Two Eves . Adam talks hip , and can only be photographed from one side because of his coinlike vaccination mark . <P> Eve was originally a languorous Italian brunette , but De Laurentiis promoted an international newspaper straw vote to find out whether the world thought of Eve as blonde or dark , and a few thousand Western Europeans in effect declared that they could not see how the mother of mankind could have come from any place east of Sweden . Eve is now a Swedish girl named Ulla Bergryd who has been accustomed to stalking about in only long tresses while paparazzi keep leaping out of the foliage to take her picture . Huston has decided that there will be no fig leaves after the Fall . He said he tried aprons of fig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Instead , Adam and Eve will clutch whole branches of vine leaves to hide their nakedness.
