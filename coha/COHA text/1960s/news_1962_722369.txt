Letters to The Times Group Opposes Health Bill Costly Program Resulting From King-Anderson Measure Predicted TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Tans : Your recent editorial advocating passage of the Administration 's King-Anderson bill ( H. R. 4222 ) to provide health care to the aged under Social Security requires a response . The insurance business is not persuaded that a need exists in this area sufficiently large or pressing to require a course of action so massive and radical . The insurance business favors the best possible health care for our entire population . Differences between proponents and opponents of the bill arise only as to the means of achieving this goal , and the ultimate effect on the nation . A longstanding principle with respect to governmental action is that the Government shall act only when a public need has not been met through private resources and initiative . Meeting Program 's Costs Today health insurers are extremely active in this field . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 65 and over were protected by some form of voluntary health insurance , an increase from three million to nine million in less than a decade , with rapid growth continuing . As evidence of this , more than eighty insurance companies are now providing a total of 157 health insurance plans and policies  --  all of them guaranteed renewable during the lifetime of the insured  --  to persons in or near retirement . On the subject of cost , the insurance business , with its extensive experience , feels it can speak with authority . The Administration says it can meet the costs of its King-Anderson bill with an 0.5 per cent increase in the Social Security tax , and an increase in the taxable earnings base from $4,800 to $5,200 . However , the Administration 's estimate is based on the unverified results of a very limited household survey . We take serious contention with the idea of formulating a vast national program on a foundation so limited and weak in vital statistical data . Insurance actuaries , using substantial actual high-aged health insurance claims data , estimate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of earnings would be required . Tax Increase In terms of cost to the individual , a worker today earning $4,800 pays $150 a year in direct Social Security taxes . His employer pays an equal amount . Under present law , this will rise to $222 by 1968 . But with King-Anderson benefits added , the tax in 1968 for a worker earning $5,200 would be at least $283.66 a year , and would constitute an 89 per cent tax increase in only six years . It would also make for a combined employe-employer Social Security tax of $567 , or more than 10 per cent of the worker 's gross iwages . Arguments advanced in favor . of the bill have led many to expect " full " and " free " medical care and an end to their health cost worries . Actually , no benefits are provided to pay doctors ' and surgeons ' fees or to pay for out-of-hospital drugs and medicines . These limited benefits can only result in disappointment to many of our aged , producing almost immediate political pressures for benefit increases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost , and in the taxes required to finance it . Hence the King-Anderson bill should be regarded only as the first step toward a comprehensive government-sponsored health care program of as yet uncalculated cost to the public . ROBERT R. NEAL , General Manager , Health Insurance Institute . Washington , April 2 , 1962 . Dutch Policy Upheld To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I wish to comment on the letter by Harum M. Usman published April 9 . Although he states that he tried to inform himself on the facts of the West New Guinea dispute between the Netherlands and Indonesia , he proceeds , in a most offhanded mahner , to accuse the Dutch of " having deported or killed several thousands of the strong pro-Indonesian population " ! This is a blatantly false and slanderous statement , which no careful student of this dispute could possibly make . The Dutch have admittedly made errors in their past policy toward this lingering dispute , but on the whole they have tried to evolve a just and equitable solution . Clearly the Netherlands Government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under United Nations supervision in which Blood for Hemophiliacs To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I would like to join Leonard Engel in complimenting The Times on the important public service it has performed with both its article of March 26 and its editorial of April 3 on the blood procurement situation in New York City . The problem is as urgent as it is unnecessary and is particularly compelling for hemophiliacs , whose emergency needs for blood plasma are especially frequent , extensive and desperate . To illustrate : One hemophiliac on the rolls of the Metropolitan Chapter of the National Hemophilia Foundation , which attempts to assist hemophiliacs in the Greater New York Area in every way possible , required 1,100 units of plasma during a ninemonth period of operation and convalescence . A 16-year old hemophiliac , requiring surgery , had to have 100 units of plasma within two days . The boy 's parents , and the Metropolitan Chapter , had to send emergency appeals for donors to the daily papers , radio and television . I cite these cases only to indicate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and do , face any day of the week . The National Hemophilia Foundation knows of other cities where the community takes responsibility for collecting and making available to all its members the blood and plasma they may require . We feel very strongly that it is high time that New York City took action to protect its citizens in this wry fundamental fashion . BERNARD R. SEGAL , Executive Director , Metropolitan Chapter , National Hemophilia Foundation . New York , April 5 1962 . Status of Guatemala Stickier Postage Stamps To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : . Edwin Tetlow , in The Times of April 10 , complains that our postage stamps do not stick on letters . This situation occurs with certain batches of stamps every two or three years and was so widespread on one occasion that the Post Office offered to exchange any stamps found unsatisfactory . My experience has been that buying stamps in coils rather than the sheets gives better results , due to heavier gum backing . H. W. HART . Brooklyn , April 10 , 1962. the Papuans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own destiny . The Dutch are morally committed to assisting these peoples in their transition to whatever future they may choose ; they could hardly be accused of holding on to this-economically burdensome territory for any selfish purpose . It is commendable that Mr. Usman has tried to , inform himself on " the facts " of this dispute . That his efforts should lead him to make such a serious and unfounded allegation as the one quoted above , however , is depressing to say the least . WILLIAM P. J. BOICHEL . Long Island City , N. Y. , April 10 , 1962 . In Defense of Teen-Alters Restrictions Placed Upon Them as a Group Queried To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES ? Whenever any group sets out to impose restrictions on a part of society it finds that its most vulnerable target is people under the age of 21 . The - censors have made proposals for banning , or " classifying , " movies for those under 21 that would be unthinkable if applied to adults . Students are forced to recite prayers in some schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government were to impose a daily prayer on all adults . The National Safety Council is always juggling the statistics to ' show that teenagers are guilty of just everything on the highway . The popular magazines every month attack some new teen-age vice .. And prohibition still remains generally in effect for those under 21 . There has never been much opposition to these restraints . The teen-agers that do oppose them are generally not articulate enough for any effective opposition , and , anyway , they can feel that in a few years they will be free of them . And the adults who would strongly protest these restrictions if they were imposed on any other group of society somehow feel that no harm is done in applying them to teenagers . This is something I ca n't understand , and it distresses me to see The Times defending the classifying of movies for those under 21 and the raising of the drinking age in New York to 21 . I suspect the average adult sees the average teen-ager as an irresponsible , undisciplined child . I wish adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may recall then that the years between 14 and 20 were years of searching and analyzing and of great questioning about philosophy , sex and society . What age , then , is more suited or has a greater need for " controversial " movies and books ? And if the adult will recall the shyness he had to overcome on his first dates , he may think that perhaps a drink now or then would not be such a bad idea . ROBERT A. ABBOTT . New York , April 4 , 1962 . Concept of Nation as Protege of United States Rejected To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : If in analyzing the present crisis in Guatemala you base yourself on the notion that Guatemala is a prot  --  g ? of the United States , your analysis is certainly , misleading . Editorial March 24 . Guatemala receives the least aid of all the A Latin-American countries from the United States . The conception of ? Guatemala as a prot  --  g ? of the United States is illusory . Guatemala 's well-established and vigorous economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( 100-pound bags ) of corn produced by the people for their own subsistence as well as on the million to million and a half bags of coffee produced by plantations of the most diverse geographic location . This economy was never dominated by the United Fruit Company monop , - oly . This monopoly exerted strong influence on the Atlantic coast banana plantations , but neither constituted the basis of the economy nor dominated other important ? products such as corn , coffee , rice , wheat , cotton , timber , and so on . Emergency Explained Guatemala is a sovereign nation . No country , no matter how strong , has the right to dispose of its ground or to choose it as a base for an invasion ; nor would Guatemala or whatever political group might be in power permit it . What occurred in April of 1961 has already been explained by the Gov-. ernment and what is least indicated is that the United States imposed its will on Guatemala in that case . Perhaps The Times wishes to take upon-itself the right of intervention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . what it is that we are trying to stabilize . " But be that as it may , the enumeration of the elements that constitute the Republic of Guatemala is erroneous and manifestly unjust . The indigenous population , regardless of the percentage it comprises in the over-all population , is neither ignorant nor lives in " dire poverty . " The rural areas and villages it inhabits are not separated from the national life , nor did it take a pro-Communist regime to incorporate them into said Guatemala 's indigenous populace constitutes a great and important moral reserve  --  with its virtues , its . customs and its spirit of cooperation with regard to realizing socioeconomic development ; in short , for its communal organization and artistic labor . Guatemala 's Government is republican , and its President receives his authority from the Constitution . According to the Constitution , there are three branches of government and a balance of power exists among them . The executive branch . governs by its President through ministers  --  any one of whom may by interpellated by Congress and may receive a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Constitution from intervening politically  --  exercises no governing power ; its functions being simply to maintain the internal and external security as well as providing professional training and aiding in the campaign against illiteracy . Slow Growth The national integration of Guatemala is a slow but steady sociological process ; constructive and sure . The democratic system which dominates the life of the nation and of multiple institutions  --  the municipal as the most important among . them  --  is slowly developing and perfecting itself ; no one claims that it is now perfect . The fault of the Castro-Communist force in the present lies in its instigation and interference , its persistent propaganda , its acts of intervention and , finally , in the presence of ex-President Arbenz-Guzman in Havana  --  a man who , since the coming to power of Fidel Castro , has dedicated himself to regaining power in Guatemala . All of this has been made public by Guatemala and is supported by irrefutable data . GUILLERMO FLORES AVENDA NO , Permanent Representative of Guatemala to the United Nations . New York , March 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
