CHAPTER I Treats of the History of the Work <P> Dickens was dead to begin with . There is no doubt whatever about that . One had only to look at Oliver to see for one 's self that Dickens was as dead as Jacob Marley . <P> He had written Oliver Twist to rip the brocade from Puritan England and reveal the human misery beneath . To those who found his melodrama too coarse , Dickens replied : " Criminal characters , to suit them , must be , like their meat , in delicate disguise ... It is wonderful , " he continued , " how Virtue turns from dirty stockings ; and how Vice , married to ribbons and a little gay attire , changes her name , as wedded ladies do , and becomes Romance . " <P> <P> CHAPTER II <P> Relates How the Musical Mingles the Appropriate and the Not So <P> Vice is what Oliver Twist tells ; Romance is what Oliver sells in this musical adaptation . And what a musical it is . A contradictory , comic , overstuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film . <P> <P> First there are the sets . " They ca n't go out whistling the scenery " is the axiom of the musical theater . Yet audiences will at least go out whistling at the scenery . John Box 's sets-the largest ever made in England-are miraculous recreations of higher and lower London . Here are the scrubbed Georgian facades of Bloomsbury , the madding , clangorous market streets , the crowded mass of blackened chimneys and gables in the Thamesside jungle . All , all are lifted from England of the 1830 's and set down without so much as a cobblestone out of place . <P> Then there are the songs . " The Parish Boy 's Progress " has nothing to sing about , but that has not stopped Composer-Lyricist Lionel Bart . Starveling orphans chant about Food , Glorious Food . Oliver asks Where Is Love ? Fagin warbles , " Can a fellow be a villain all his life ? " Well done ? Indeed . Appropriate ? In doubt . Putting trust in sounds and forms , Bart has obscured the message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Dickens . The " demd horrid grind " is gone . In its place is solid , canny entertainment . Purists and sociologists will object as loudly as Christmas audiences will applaud . <P> <P> CHAPTER III <P> And Last : Praise and a Prediction Based on a Past Performance <P> The fortunes of those who had figured in this account are nearly closed . The little that remains to their historian to relate is told in few and simple words . It is well that Director Carol Reed ( The Third Man ) has strayed from the far less successful Broadway version , which was stunted by stage boundaries and hampered by overplayers . Instead he has gone to a richer predecessor : David Lean 's virtuous 1948 adaptation , memorable for its palpable atmosphere of terror and decorum . After a season of watching inane twitching in the name of dance , the viewer is most happily greeted by Onna White 's choreography , an exuberant step-by-step exploration of Victorian zeal .                 @ @ @ @
