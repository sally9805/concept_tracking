 | " A VERY STERN DISCIPLINE " An Interview with Ralph Ellison Ralph Ellison 's memorable first novel , Invisible Man , winner of the National Book Award for 1952 , brought him immediately to the front rank of American writers . His essay , " Harlem Is Nowhere , " appeared in Harper 's in 1964 , and was included in his book of essays and reviews , Shadow and Act . Ellison is a native of Oklahoma City . In 1933 he went to the Deep South to Tuskegee Institute in Alabama , where he majored in music . Later he came to New York City to study sculpture , but he turned to writing and since 1939 his stories and articles have been widely published . This interview , which Ellison has revised from the original tapes , was conducted by three young Negro writers ( see page 79 ) . Interviewers : Do you think that one of the faults of the Negro writer is that he is unable to come to terms with the human condition ? particularly that of the Negro in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak generally . The conception of the human condition varies for each and every writer just as it does for each and every individual . Each must live within the isolation of his own senses , dreams , and memories ; each must die his own death . For the writer the problem is to project his own conception eloquently and artistically . Like all good artists , he stakes his talent against the world . But if a Negro writer is going to listen to sociologists ? as too many of us do ? who tell us that Negro life is thus-and-so in keeping with certain sociological theories , he is in trouble because he will have abandoned his task before he begins . If he accepts the cliches to the effect that the Negro family is usually a broken family , that it is matriarchal in form and that the mother dominates and castrates the males , if he believes that Negro males are having all of these alleged troubles with their sexuality , or that Harlem is a " Negro ghetto " ? which means to paraphrase one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood on the stairs " ? well , he 'll never see the people of whom he wishes to write . He 'll never learn to use his own eyes and his own heart , and he 'll never master the art of fiction . I do n't deny that these sociological formulas are drawn from life , but I do deny that they define the complexity of Harlem . They only abstract it and reduce it to proportions which the sociologists can manage . I simply do n't recognize Harlem in them . And I certainly do n't recognize the people of Harlem whom I know . Which is by no means to deny the ruggedness of life there , nor the hardship , the poverty , the sordidness , the filth . But there is something else in Harlem , something subjective , willful , and complexly and compellingly human . It is " that something else " that challenges the sociologists who ignore it , and the society which would deny its existence . It is that " something else " which makes for our strength , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper subject for the Negro American writer . Hell , he does n't have to spend all the tedious time required to write novels simply to repeat  | what the sociologists and certain white intellectuals are broadcasting like a zoo full of parrots ? and getting much more money for it than most Negro writers will ever see . If he does this he 'll not only go begging , but worse , he 'll lie to his people , discourage their interest in literature , and emasculate his own talent . This is tricky terrain , because today the sociologists are up to their necks in politics and have access to millions of governmental dollars , which , I 'm afraid , have been secured at the cost of propagating an image of the Negro condition which is apt to destroy our human conception of ourselves just at the moment when we are becoming politically free . Those who buy this image are surely in trouble , no matter the money it brings . One of the saddest sights currently to be seen is that provided by one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to be enslaved by his acceptance of negative sociological data . He rants and raves against society , but he 's actually one of the safest Negroes on the scene . Because he challenges nothing , he can only shout " ' taint " to some abstract white " ' t is , " countering lies with lies . The human condition ? He thinks that white folks have ruled Negroes out of it . A few years ago there was a drunk who collected newspapers from the shops along Broadway between 145th and 153rd Streets . He was a Negro who had fought the wine for a long time and who when drunk was capable of a metaphysical defiance . His favorite pastime was to take a stand near a stoplight and accost white people who stopped for the traffic signal with shouts of " Why do n't you go back down town ! I want all you white m ... f ... s ? mens and womens ? to go on back down town ! " Our hate-mongering fellow writer reminds me very much of this man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , we do have a terrible time in dealing with the human condition . One critic has said that the Jewish writer went through a similar period . I think he was trying to say that the Negro writer would very soon get over this and become the major strength in American literature . I hope he 's right , but I would n't want to make  | a prediction . I think , however , that the parallel is much too facile . Jewish writers are more familiar with literature as a medium of expression . Their history provides for a close identification with writers who were , and are , Jewish even when they wrote or write in languages other than Yiddish or Hebrew ; and this even when that identification rests simply on a shared religious tradition and hardly on any other cultural ground whatsoever . It reminds me of our attempts to claim Pushkin and Dumas as Negroes . By contrast , neither Negro American expression nor religion has been primarily literary . We are by no means , as is said of the Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see this as a matter for regret . For we have a wider freedom of selection . We took much from the ancient Hebrews and we do share , through Christianity , the values embodied in the literature of much of the world . But our expression has been oral as against " literary . " And when it comes to the question of identifying those writers who have shaped American literature ? the framers of the Declaration , the Constitution , and Lincoln excepted ? we tend to project racial categories into the areas of artistic technique , form , insight ; areas where race has no proper place . We seem to forget that one can identify with what a writer has written , with its form , its manner , techniques , while rejecting the writer 's beliefs , his prejudices , philosophy , values . The Jewish American writers have , on the other hand , identified with Eliot , Pound , Hemingway , and Joyce as writers while questioning and even rejecting their various attitudes toward the Jews , toward religion , politics , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they could use from such writers and converted it to express their own personal and group sense of reality ; they have used it to express their own definitions of the American experience . But we Negro writers seem seldom to have grasped this process of acculturation . Too often we 've been in such haste to express our anger and our pain as to allow the single tree of race to obscure our view of the magic forest of art . If Negro writers ever become the mainstay of American literature , it will be because they have learned their craft and used the intensity , emotional and political , of their group experience to express a greater area of American experience than the writers of other groups . What the Jewish American writer had to learn before he could find his place was the American-ness of his experience . He had to see himself as American and project his Jewish experience as an experience unfolding within this pluralistic society . When this was done , it was possible to project this variant of the American experience as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that any one group can speak for the whole experience ? which is n't , perhaps , desirable . They can only reduce it to metaphor , and no one has yet forged a metaphor rich enough to reduce American diversity to form . Certainly the current group of Jewish writers ? among whom there are several I admire ? do not speak adequately for me or for Negroes generally . But during the ' thirties Jewish writing , although more skillful , was as provincial as most Negro American writing is today . That 's the way it was and we do n't solve problems of history by running away from them . And what I mean by provincial is an inability to see beyond the confines , the constrictions , placed upon Jewish life by its religious and cultural differences with the larger society ; by its being basically the experience of an immigrant people who were , by and large , far less cultured than their more representative members . It took long years of living in this country , long years of being a unique part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live on the East Side , of discovering that there was a place for the Jews in this society which did not depend upon their losing their group identity . They discovered that they possessed something precious to bring to the broader American culture , on the lowest as well as on the highest levels of human activity , and that it would have a creative impact far beyond the Jewish community . Many had not only to learn the language but , more wonderful , they had to discover that the Jewish American idiom would lend a whole new dimension to the American language . How do the situations of the Negro and Jewish writers differ ? I think that Negro Americans as writers run into certain problems which the Jews do n't have . One is that our lives , since slavery , have been described mainly in terms of our political , economic , and social conditions as measured by outside norms , seldom in terms of our own sense of life or our own sense of values gained from our own unique American experience . Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives . Southern whites used to tell the joke about the white employer who said to a Negro worker , " You 're a good hand and I appreciate you . You make my business go much better . But , although you work well every day , I can never get you to work on Saturday night , even if I offer to pay you overtime . Why is this ? " Of course , you know the answer : " If you could just be a Negro  | one Saturday night you 'd never want to be a white man again . " Now this is a rather facile joke , and a white Southern joke on Negroes ; nevertheless , it does indicate an awareness that there is an internality to Negro American life , that it possesses its own attractions and its own mystery . Now , the pathetic element in the history of Negro American writing is that it started out by reflecting the styles popular at the time , styles uninterested in the human complexity of Negroes . These were the styles of dialect humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minstrel tradition . This was Dunbar and Chestnutt . It helped them get published but it got in the way of their subject matter and their goal of depicting Negro personality . And let 's face it , these were times when white publishers and the white reading public only wished to encounter certain types of Negroes in poetry and fiction . Even so , it was not a Negro writer who created the most memorable character in this tradition but Mark Twain , whose Nigger Jim is , I think , one of the important characters in our literature . Nevertheless , Jim is flawed by his relationship to the minstrel tradition . Twain 's drawing of Jim reflected the popular culture of the 1880s , just as the Negro characters you get in much of current fiction are influenced by the stereotypes presented by the movies and by sociology ? those even more powerful media of popular culture . The Negro writers who appeared during the 1920s wished to protest discrimination ; some wished to show off their high regard for respectability ; they wished to express their new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to win a place as writers , they were drawn to the going style of literary decadence represented by Carl Van Vechten 's work . This was an extremely ironic development for a group whose written literature was still in its infancy ? as incongruous as the notion of a decadent baby . More ironic , this was a time when Eliot , Pound , Hemingway , and Stein were really tearing American literature apart and reshaping its values and its styles in the " revolution of the word . " We always picked the moribund style . We took to dialect at a time when Benito Cereno , Moby Dick , and Leaves of Grass were at hand to point a more viable direction for a people whose demands were revolutionary , and whose humanity had been badly distorted by the accepted styles . During the 1930s we were drawn , for more understandable reasons , to the theories of proletarian literature . So during the ' twenties we had wanted to be fashionable and this insured , even @# more effectively than the approaching Depression , the failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into that old trap by which the segregated segregate themselves by trying to turn whatever the whites said against us into its opposite . If they said Negroes love fried chicken ( and why should n't we ? ) , we replied , " We hate fried chicken . " If they said " Negroes have no normal family life , " we replied , " We have a staider , more refined , more puritanical family life than you . " If they said that Negroes love pork chops , we replied , " We despise them ! " With few exceptions , our energies as writers have too often been focused upon outside definitions of reality , and we 've used literature for racial polemics rather than as an agency through which we might define  | experience as we ourselves have seen and felt it . These are negative charges , I know , but they seem true to me . Indeed , it 's very difficult , even today , for younger Negro writers to come along and overcome these negative tendencies . Far too often they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can do thus and so ? not because human beings express themselves in these ways , but because such and such a Negro dared to do so . " And if no other Negro has involved himself in the activity in question , then we tend to draw back and doubt that we might do very well even as pioneers . And so the younger writer comes along and tries to write on the models of other Negro writers rather than on the best writers regardless of race , class , or what have you ? completely ignoring the fact that all other writers try to pattern themselves on the achievements of the greatest writers , regardless of who the hell they were . This is how the Jim Crow experience has gotten into our attitudes and set us back . We have been exiled in our own land and , as for our efforts at writing , we have been little better than silent because we have not been cunning . I find this rather astounding , because I feel that Negro American folklore is very powerful , wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a people who were assertive , eclectic , and irreverent before all the oral and written literature that came within its grasp . It took what it needed to express its sense of life and rejected what it could n't use . But what we 've achieved in folklore has seldom been achieved in the novel , the short story , or poetry . In the folklore we tell what Negro experience really is . We back away from the chaos of experience and from ourselves , and we depict the humor as well as the horror of our living . We project Negro life in a metaphysical perspective and we have seen it with a complexity of vision that seldom gets into our writing . One reason for this lies in the poor teaching common to our schools and colleges , but the main failure lies , 1 think , in our simpleminded attempt to reduce fiction to a mere protest . I notice that you mentioned , quite some time ago , that you learned a lot of skill under Richard Wright . Do you find that he gauged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He certainly tried to do so . He was constantly reading the great masters , just as he read the philosophers , the political theorists , the social and literary critics . He did not limit himself in the manner that many Negro writers currently limit themselves . And he encouraged other writers ? who usually rebuffed him ? to become conscio : ; craftsmen , to plunge into the world of conscious literature and take their chances unafraid . He felt this to be one of the few areas in which Negroes could be as free and as equal as their mind , and talents would allow . And like a good Negro - athlete , he believed in his ability to compete . Ii . 1940 he was well aware that Native Son was being published at a time when The Grapes of Wrati. and For Whom the Bell Tolls would be his main competition . Nevertheless , he looked toward publication day nervously but eagerly . He wished to be among the most advanced artists and was willing to run the risk required . Earlier you referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat such stereotypes as Sambo , or even Stepin Fetchit , as archetypes of motives instead of using them in the usual format ? Well , in fiction stereotypes partake of archetypes . And to the extent that stereotypes point to something basically human , they overlap . And yes , in literary form stereotypes function , as do other forms of characterization , as motives . But the point is that they act as imposed motives which treat reality and character arbitrarily . Thus to redeem them as you suggest , the writer is challenged to reveal the archetypical truth hidden within the stereotype . Here archetypes are embodiments of abiding patterns of human existence which underlie racial , cultural , and religious differences . They are , in their basic humanity , timeless and raceless ; while stereotypes are malicious reductions of human complexity which seize upon such characteristics as color , the shape of a nose , an accent , hair texture , and convert them into emblems which render it unnecessary for the prejudiced individual to confront the humanity of those upon whom the stereotype has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it is possible to use such stereotypes as Sambo and Stepin Fetchit , I 'd say that it depends upon the writer 's vision . If I should use such stereotypes in fiction , I 'd have to reveal their archetypical aspects because my own awareness of , and identification with , the human complexity which they deny would compel me to transform them into something more recognizably human . To do less would be to reveal a brutalization of my own sense of human personality . On the other hand , let 's take Faulkner . When Lucas Beauchamp first appears in Faulkner 's work he appears as a stereotype , but as he was  | developed throughout the successive novels , he became one of Faulkner 's highest representatives of human quality . Or again , when Ned in the last book , The Reivers , is seen superficially he appears to be the usual head-scratching , eye-rolling Negro stereotype . But beneath this mask , Ned is a version of John , the archetypical Negro slave of Negro folklore , who always outwits and outtalks his master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so doing he is revealed as Faulkner 's own persona . He is the artist disguised as Negro rogue and schemer . This suggests that attempts to approach stereotypes strictly in racial terms is , for the Negro writer , very , very dangerous . We must first question what they conceal , otherwise we place ourselves in the position of rejecting the basic truth concealed in the stereotype along with its obvious falsehood . Truth is much too precious for that . On the stage of Town Hall a few days before the 1964 Democratic Convention , a group from the Mississippi Freedom Democratic party talked of their experiences . To the facile eye one of the men who talked there might well have been mistaken for the Sambo stereotype . He was Southern , rural ; his speech was heavily idiomatic , his tempo slow . A number of his surface characteristics seemed to support the stereotype . But had you accepted him as an incarnation of Sambo you would have missed a very courageous man ? a man who understood only too well that his activities in aiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Movement placed his life in constant contact with death , but who continued to act . Now I 'm not going to reject that man because some misinformed person , some prejudiced person , sees him as the embodiment of Uncle Tom , or Sambo . What 's inside you , brother ; what 's your heart like ? What are your real values ? What human qualities are hidden beneath your idiom ? Do you think the reason for this is that Negroes in the U.S. are caught , if they allow themselves to be , in a bind ? Do you think that the Negro writer then is forced , sometimes , to go away to gain a perspective ? Or can he transcend his situation by remaining in it ? Well , again , I would say that the individual must do that which is necessary for him individually . However , I would also say that it is not objectively necessary to go away . He might solve his problem by leaving the Village or by leaving Harlem . Harlem has always been a difficult place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has sponsored a false sense of freedom . It has also sponsored a false sense of superiority regarding Negroes who live elsewhere . I remember getting into an argument during World War II with a fellow who insisted that Southern Negroes had no knowledge of boxing or baseball . This came from refusing to use his eyes around New York . One frees oneself , as a writer , by actually going in and trying to get the shape of experience from the writer 's perspective . I see no other way . But this , unfortunately , requires a writer 's type of memory ? which is strongly emotional and associative ? and a certain amount of technique . You must pay the Negro community the respect of trying to see it through the enrichening perspectives provided by great literature ? using your own intelligence to make up for the differences in economy , in class background , in education , in conscious culture , in manners and in attitude toward values . Human beings are basically the same and differ mainly in life style . Here revelation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " argument " ? I mean that it 's futile to argue our humanity with those who willfully refuse to recognize it , when art can reveal on its own terms more truth while providing pleasure , insight , and for Negro readers at least , affirmation and a sense of direction . We must assert our own sense of values , beginning with the given and the irrevocable , with the question of heroism and slavery . Contrary to some , I feel that our experience as a people involves a great deal of heroism . From one perspective , slavery was horrible and brutalizing . It is said that " Those Africans were enslaved , they died in the middle passage , ' they were abused , their families were separated , they were whipped , they were raped , ravaged , and emasculated . " And the Negro writer is tempted to agree . " Yes ! God damn it , was n't that a horrible thing ! " And he sometimes agrees to the next step , which holds that slaves had very little humanity because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what the Stanley M. Elkins " Sambo " argument implies . But despite the historical past and the injustices of the present , there is from my perspective something further to say . I have to affirm my forefathers and I must affirm my parents or be reduced in my own mind to a white man 's inadequate ? even if unprejudiced ? conception of human complexity . Yes , and I must affirm those unknown people who sacrificed for me . I 'm speaking of those Negro Americans who never knew that a Ralph Ellison might exist , but who by living their own lives and refusing to be  | destroyed by social injustice and white supremacy , real or illusory , made it possible for me to live my own life with meaning . I am forced to look at these people and upon the history of life in the U. S. and conclude that there is another reality behind the appearance of reality which they would force upon us as truth . Any people who could endure all of that brutalization and keep together , who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could take the initiative in achieving its own freedom is obviously more than the sum of its brutalization . Seen in this perspective , theirs has been one of the great human experiences and one of the great triumphs of the human spirit in modern times . In fact , in the history of the world . Some might say to your argument that you are expressing your own hopes and aspirations for Negroes , rather than reporting historical reality . But hope and aspiration are indeed important aspects of the reality of Negro American history , no less than that of others . Besides , it 's one of our roles as writers to remind ourselves of such matters , just as it is to make assertions tempered by the things of the spirit . It might sound arrogant to say so , but writers , poets , help create or reveal hidden realities by asserting their existence . Otherwise they might as well become social scientists . I do not find it a strain to point to the heroic component of our experience , for these seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must now recognize consciously . And I am not denying the negative things which have happened to us and which continue to happen , but I am compelled to reject all condescending , narrowly paternalistic interpretations of Negro American life and personality from whatever quarters they come , whether white or Negro . Such interpretations would take the negative details of our existence and make them the whole of our life and personality . But literature teaches us that mankind has always defined itself against the negatives thrown it by both society and the universe . It is human will , human hope , and human effort which make the difference . Let 's not forget that the great tragedies not only treat of negative matters , of violence , brutalities , defeats , but they treat them within a context of man 's will to act , to challenge reality and to snatch triumph from the teeth of destruction . You said it 's unnecessary for one to leave the country to get a perspective . We notice in some of your older writings that after having core back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Invisible Man . No , I started Invisible Man ? that novel about a man characterized by what the sociologists term " high visibility " ? in Vermont , during the few months before the war came to an end . I was cooking on merchant ships at the time and had bees given shore leave , so I accepted the invitation of a friend and went up there . I had no idea that I was going to start a book . But maybe I shouid add this : it is n't where you are that 's important . but what you seek to depict , and most important of all is perspective . And the main perspective through which a writer looks at experience is that provided by literature ? just as the perspective through which a physician looks at the human body is the discipline of medicine ; an accumulation of techniques , insights , instruments , and processes which have been slowly developed over long periods of time . So when I look at my material I 'm not looking at it simply through the concepts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look at it through literature ; English , French , Spanish , Russian ? especially 19th-century Russian literature . And Irish literature , Joyce and Yeats , and through the international literature of the ' twenties . And through the perspective of folklore . When I listen to a folk story I 'm looking for what it conceals as well as what it states . I read it with the same fullness of attention I bring to Finnegans Wake or The Sound and the Fury because I 'm eager to discover what it has to say to me personally . Living abroad is very necessary for those Negro writers who feel that they 've been too cramped here and who wish to discover how it feels to live free of racial restrictions . This is valid . I should also say this : I came to New York from Tuskegee with the intention of going back to finish college . I came up to work . I did n't earn the money so I stayed . But while I lived at the Harlem YMCA I did not come to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Harlem as a very romantic place . I 'm pointing to an attitude of mind ; I was not exchanging Southern segregation for Northern segregation , but seeking a wider world of opportunity . And , most of all , the excitement and impersonality of a great city . I wanted room in which to discover who I was . So one of the first things I had to do was to enter places from which I was afraid I might be rejected . I had to confront my own fears of the unknown . I told myself , " Well , I might be hurt , but I wo n't dodge until they throw a punch . " Over and over again I found that it was just this atti- tude ( which finally became unselfconsciously nondefensive ) which made the difference between my being accepted or rejected , and this during a time when many places practiced discrimination . This requires submitting oneself to personal ordeals , especially if one grew up in the South and Southwest . Nor is this because you are afraid of white people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuffed . You do n't wish to be upset when you 're going to see a play by having a racial hassle on your hands . This distaste is very human . I 've had a white Mississippian stop me on the streets of Rome asking if he would be admitted to a certain place which had caught his eye . I said , with a certain pleasurable irony , " Sure , go ahead ; just tell them you 're a friend of mine . " What do you consider the Negro writer 's responsibility to American literature as a whole ? The writer , any American writer , becomes basically responsible for the health of American literature the moment he starts writing seriously . And this regardless of his race or religious background . This is no arbitrary matter . Just as there is implicit in the act of voting the responsibility of helping to govern , there is implicit in the act of writing a responsibility for the quality of the American language ? its accuracy , its vividness , its simplicity , its expressiveness ? and responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you regard President Johnson 's statement that " Art is not a political weapon ? " He made it at the White House in 1965 . I do n't think you 've got it complete ; let 's read it . He said , " Your art is not a political weapon , yet much of what you do is profoundly political , for you seek out the common pleasures and visions , the terrors and cruelties of man 's day on this planet . And I would hope you would help dissolve the barriers of hatred and ignorance which are the source of so much of our pain and danger . " You think that he is far ahead of many people ? He is far ahead of most of the intellectuals ? especially those Northern liberals who have become , in the name of the highest motives , the new apologists for segregation . Some of the Commentary writers , for instance . Let 's put it this way . President Johnson 's speech at Howard University spelled out the meaning of full integration for Negroes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln nor Roosevelt , no matter how much . we love and respected them , has ever done before . There was no hedging in it , no escape clauses . About Robert Lowell 's refusal in 1965 to participate in the White House Art Festival , was this justly done , or do you think that he was engaged too much in politics ? Do you think it was neces-sary ? I do not think it was necessary . When Lowell wrote to the President ? and it was a skillfully written letter ? he stated his motives of conscience , his fear that his presence would commit him to the President 's foreign policy . In other words , he feared the potency of his own presence in such a setting , a potency which would seem to rest in his person rather than in the poetry for which we praise him and consider him great . But he did n't stop there , the letter got to the press , and once this happened , it became a political act , a political gesture . I think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write his poetry , and I do n't think he 's in any position to tell the President how to run the government . Had I been running the Festival I 'd simply have had an actor read from Lowell 's poetry ? with his permission , of course ? for then not only would we have had the best of Lowell , but the question of his feelings concerning foreign policy would n't have come up . Actually , no one was questioned as to his attitudes , political or otherwise ? except by Dwight 1Vlacdonald . It was n't that kind of occasion . Any and every opinion was represented there . Millard Lampell , who had been picketing the White House , had part of his play presented , and his background is no secret . So it was not in itself a political occasion , and all of the hullabaloo was beside the point . I was very much amazed , having gone through the political madness that marked the intellectual experience of the ' thirties , to see so many of our leading American intellectuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again running in a herd . One may take a personal position concerning a public issue which is much broader than his personal morality , and the others make a herd of free creative minds ! Some of my best friends are mixed up in it ? which leaves me all the more amazed . Speaking of herd activity , do you think that writers , generally , band together for the added stimulation or appreciation that they need ? Or do you think that it is a lack , on their part , of a certain kind of intelligence ? It depends upon their reason for coming to- gether . I think it very important for writers to come together during the early stages of their careers , especially during the stage when they are learning their techniques , when they are struggling for that initial fund of knowledge upon which they form their tastes and upon which artistic choices are made . And it 's good for artists to get together to eat and drink ? for social activities . But when they get together in some sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulated by a person or group of persons who are not particularly interested in art . In other words , are you denying what happened to you in the ' thirties , during The New Masses experience ? No , I do n't deny that at all ; instead , I speak out of that experience . But what happened to me during the ' thirties was part of a great swell of events which I plunged into when I came to town an undergraduate musician , and through which I gradually transformed myself into a writer . The stimulus that existed in New York during the ' thirties was by no means limited to art ; it was also connected with politics , it was part of the esprit de corps developed in the country after we had endured the Depression for a few years . It had to do with my discovering New York and the unfamiliar areas of the society newly available to me . It had to do with working on the New York Writers Project and getting to know white friends , and being around Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Writers crowd . But , if you 'll note ? and the record is public ? I never wrote the official type of fiction . I wrote what might be called propaganda ? having to do with the Negro struggle ? but my fiction was always trying to be something else ; something different even from Wright 's fiction . I never accepted the ideology which The New Masses attempted to impose on writers . They hated Dostoevski , but I was studying Dostoevski . They felt that Henry James was a decadent , some sort of snob who had nothing to teach a writer from the lower classes ? I was studying James . I was also reading Marx , Gorki , Sholokhov , and Isaac Babel . I was reading everything , including the Bible . Most of all , I was reading Malraux . I-thought so much of that little Modern Library edition of Man 's Fate that I had it bound in leather . This is where I was really living at the time . So perhaps it is the writers whose work has most impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we congregate publicly . Anyway , I think style is more important than political ideologies . Do you see , then , a parallel between the thirties and the ' sixties , with this new resurgence of you n Negro writers , with this turning toward African and , shall we say again , the resurgence of a particular kind of provincialism in New Negro writing ? I think that we should be very careful in drawing parallels . This is a period of affluence as against the poverty of the Depression . True , during that period a lot of Negroes had the opportunity to work in WPA at clerical jobs and so on . so that for us the Depression represented in many ways a lunge forward . We were beneficiaries of the government 's efforts toward national recovery . Thanks to the national chaos , we found new places for ourselves . Today , our lunges forward are facilitated by laws designed precisely to correct our condition as a group ? by laws which start at the very top and which have the Supreme Court , the Executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from the ' thirties . As to Africa , I think it probably true that more of the present crop of writers are concerned with Africa than was true during that period . In fact , quite a number who were concerned with communism are now fervid black nationalists . Oddly enough , however , their way of writing has n't changed significantly . Of course , I might not know what I 'm talking about , but there seem to be fewer Negro writers around who seem publishable at the moment . Surely there are fewer than the more favorable circumstances of today warrant . Some people think that you should play a larger part in civil rights . . . . This is similar to Sartre 's rebuttal to Camus in Situations , this idea of " engagement . " Well , I 'm no Camus and they 're no Sartres . But literature draws upon much deeper and much more slowly changing centers of the human personality than does politics . It draws mainly from literature itself , and upon the human experience which has abided long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think that revolutionary political movements move much too rapidly to be treated as the subjects for literature in themselves . When Malraux drew upon revolution as the settings for his novels he drew for his real themes upon much deeper levels of his characters ' consciousness than their concern with Marxism ; and it is to these deeper concerns , to the realm of tragedy , that they turned when facing death . Besides , political movements arise and extend themselves , achieve themselves , through fostering myths which interpret their actions and their goals . And if you tell the truth about a poli-l  | tician , you 're always going to encounter contradiction and barefaced lies ? especially when you 're dealing with left-wing politicians . If I were to write an account of the swings and twitches of the U. S. Communist line during the ' thirties and ' forties , it would be a very revealing account , but I would n't attempt to do this in terms of fiction . It would have to be done in terms of political science , reportage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their moves , look at the directives handed down by the Communist International ? whatever the overall body was called . And you would be in a muck and a mire of dead and futile activity ? much of which had little to do with their ultimate goals or with American reality . They fostered the myth that Communism was twentieth-century Americanism , but to be a twentieth-century American meant , in their thinking , that you had to be more Russian than American and less Negro than either . That 's how they lost the Negroes . The Communists recognized no plurality of interests and were really responding to the necessities of Soviet foreign policy , and when the war came , Negroes got caught and were made expedient in the shifting . of policy . Just as Negroes who fool around with them today are going to get caught in the next turn of the screw . Do you think there is too much pressure on the Negro writer to play the role of politician , instead of mastering his craft and acting as a professional writer ? Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in a bad way . Because someone is always going to tell you that you ca n't write , and then they tell you what to write . Among the first things the Negro writer has to resist is being told that he 'll find it difficult to make a buck . I waded through tons of that . But I decided that I would make sacrifices , go without clothing and other necessities , in order to buy books , in order to be in New York where I could talk to certain creative people and where I could observe this or that phenomenon . Resisting these warnings is most important . And if you deflect this particular pressure , there will always be people who will tell you that you have no talent . We understand the psychological dynamics of it ? Booker T. Washington gave it the " crabs in a basket " metaphor : if a Negro threatens to succeed in a field outside the usual areas of Negro professionals , others feel challenged . It 's a protective reaction , a heritage from slavery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the nerve to do that ? I do n't have the nerve to do that ; what does he think he 's doing , endangering the whole group ? " Nevertheless the writer must endure the agony imposed by this group pessimism . Why do you think this exists ? Because our sense of security and our sense of who we are depends upon our feeling that we can account for each and every member of the group . And to this way of thinking any assertion of individuality is dangerous . I 'm reminded of a woman whom I met at a party . We were discussing Negro life and I uttered opinions indicating an approach unfamiliar to her . Her indignant response was . " How do you come talking like that ? I never even heard of you ! " In her opinion I had no right to express ideas which had n't been certified by her particular social group . Naturally she thought of herself as a member of a Negro elite and in the position to know what each and every Negro thought and should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't nail it to Negroes because it happens in the Jewish community as well . In the interview that you had in Robert Penn Warren 's Who Speaks for the Negro ? he addressed a question to you that has something to do with Negroes being culturally deprived , and you answered that many of the white students whom you 'd taught were also culturally deprived . They were culturally deprived , you said , because while they might have understood many things intellectually , they were emotionally unprepared to deal with them . But the Negro was being prepared emotionally , whether intellectually or not , from the moment he was placed in the crib . Would you expand that a bit ? I think you 've touched the important area that gets lost when we hold such discussions . I get damn tired of critics writing of me as though I do n't know how hard it is to be a Negro American . My point is that it is n't only hard , that there are many-. many good things about it . But they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true of some of our Jewish critics . They get quite upset when I say : I like this particular aspect of Negro life and would not surrender it . What I want is something else to go along with it . And when I get the other things , I 'm not going to try to invade the grcup life of anybody else . And of course they do n't like the idea that I reject many of the aspects of life which they regard highly . But you know , white people can get terribly disturbed at the idea that Negroes are not simply being restricted from many areas of our national life , but that they are also judging certain aspects of our culture and rejecting their values . That 's  | where assumptions of white superiority , conscious or unconscious , make for blindness and naivete . For in fact we 've rejected many of their values from the days before there were Jim Crow laws . Only a narrowly sociological explanation of society could lead to the belief that we Negroes are what we are simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial discrimination . Frequently Negroes are able to pay for commodities available in the stores , but we reject them as a matter of taste ? not economics . There is no de facto Jim Crow in many areas of New York , but we do n't frequent them , not because we think we wo n't be welcome ? indeed many Negroes go to places precisely because they are unfairly and illegally rejected ? but because they simply do n't interest us . All this we know to be true . Negro Americans had to learn to live under pressure ? otherwise we 'd have been wiped out , or in the position of the Indians , set on a reservation and rendered powerless by the opposing forces . Fortunately , our fate was different . We were forced into segregation , but within that situation we were able to live close to the larger society and to abstract from that society enough combinations of values ? including religion and hope and art ? which allowed us to endure and impose our own idea of what the world should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American society should be . I 'm not speaking of power here , but of vision , of values and dreams . Yes , and of will . What is missing today is a corps of artists and intellectuals who would evaluate Negro American experience from the inside , and out of a broad knowledge of how people of other cultures live , deal with experience , and give significance to their experience . We do too little of this . Rather we depend upon outsiders ? mainly sociologists ? to interpret our lives for us . It does n't seem to occur to us that our interpreters might well be not so much prejudiced as ignorant , insensitive , and arrogant . It does n't occur to us that they might be of shallow personal culture , or innocent of the complexities of actual living . It 's ironic that we act this way , because over and over again when we find bunches of Negroes enjoying themselves , when they 're feeling good and in a mood of communion , they sit around and marvel at what a damnable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro American really is . This is the underlying significance of so many of our bull sessions . We exchange accounts of what happened to someone whom the group once knew . " You know what that so-and-so did , " we say ; and then his story is told . His crimes , his loves , his outrages , his adventures , his transformations , his moments of courage , his heroism , buffooneries , defeats , and triumphs are recited with each participant joining in . And this catalogue soon becomes a brag , a very exciting chant celebrating the metamorphosis which this individual in question underwent within the limited circumstances available to us . This is wonderful stuff ; in the process the individual is enlarged . It 's as though a transparent overlay of archetypal myth is being placed over the life of an individual , and through him we see ourselves . This , of course , is what literature does with life ; these verbal jam sessions are indeed a form of folk literature and they help us to define our own experience . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose this wonderful capacity for abstracting and enlarging life . Instead we ask , " How do we fit into the sociological terminology ? Gunnar Myrdal said this experience means thus and so . And Dr. Kenneth Clark , or Dr. E. Franklin Frazier , says the same thing . . . " And we try to fit our experience into their concepts . Well , whenever I hear a Negro intellectual describing Negro life and personality with a catalogue of negative definitions , my first question is , how did you escape . is it that you were born exceptional and superior ? If I can not look at the most brutalized Negro on the street , even when he irritates me and makes me want to bash his head in because he 's goofing off , I must still say within myself , " Well , that 's you too , Ellison . " And I 'm not talking about guilt , but of an identification which goes beyond race . You have said that Hemingway tells us much more about how Negroes feel than all . the writings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What I meant was this : Hemingway 's writing of the ' twenties and the ' thirties ? even of the ' forties ? evoked certain basic , deeply felt moods and attitudes within his characters which closely approximated certain basic attitudes held by many Negroes in regard to their position in American society , and in regard to their sense of the human predicament . And he did this not only because he was a greater writer than the participants in the Negro Renaissance , but because he possessed a truer sense of what the valid areas of perplexity were and a more accurate sense of how to get life into literature . He recognized that the socalled " Jazz Age " was a phony , while most Negro writers jumped on that illusory bandwagon when they , of all people , should have known better . I was also referring to Hemingway 's characters '  | attitude toward society , to their morality , their code of technical excellence , to their stoicism , their courage or " grace under pressure , " to their skepticism as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of which our society was supposed to be governed , but which Hemingway found highly questionable when measured against our actual conduct . Theirs was an attitude springing from an awareness that they lived outside the values of the larger society , and I feel that their attitudes came close to the way Negroes pelt about the way the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were applied to us . Further , 1 believe that Hemingway , in depicting the attitudes of athletes , expatriates , bullfighters , traumatized soldiers , and impotent idealists , told us quite a lot about what was happening to that most representative group of Negro Americans , the jazz musicians ? who also lived by an extreme code of withdrawal , technical and artistic excellence , rejection of the values of respectable society . They replaced the abstract and much-betrayed ideals of that society with the more physical values of eating , drinking , copulating , loyalty to friends , and dedication to the discipline and values of their art . Now I say all this while fully aware that Hemingway seldom depicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types we prefer to encounter in fiction . But to see what 1 mean one has only to look upon the world of Hemingway 's fiction as offering a valid metaphor not only for the predicament of young whites , but as a metaphor for the post-World War I period generally . Seen in this inclusive light he tells us a hell of a lot about the way Negroes were feeling and acting . At any rate , this is how I use literature to come to an understanding of our situation . It does n't have to be , thank God , about Negroes in order to give us insights into our own predicament . You do not , to my way of thinking , assume that a writer can treat of his times , if he writes well , without revealing a larger segment of life than that of the specific milieu which engaged his attention ; for it must if it is to be valid go beyond and touch the reality of other groups and individuals . Faulkner tells us a great deal about many different groups who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 93 cause he wrote so truthfully . If you would find the imaginative equivalents of certain civil-rights figures in American writing , Rosa Parks and James Meredith say , you do n't go to most fiction by Negroes , but to Faulkner . You have said that you do n't accept any theory which implies that culture is transmitted through the genes . What , then , is your reaction to the concept of " negritude " ? To me it represents the reverse of that racism with which prejudiced whites approach Negroes . As a theory of art it implies precisely that culture is transmitted through the genes . It is a blood theory . There are members of my family who are very black people , and there are some who are very white ? which means that I am very much Negro , very much Negro American , and quite representative of that racial type with its mixture of African , European , and indigenous American blood . This is a biological fact ; but recognizing this , and loving my family , and recognizing that I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no " Take five . "  | means to agree with the proponents of negritude . Because even while I affirm our common blood line I recognize that we are bound less by blood than by our cultural and political circumstances . Further , I do n't believe that my form of expression springs from Africa , although it might be easier for me as an artist if it did , because then , perhaps , a massive transfusion of pure Nigerian blood would transform me into a great sculptor . I 've been reading the classics of European and American literature since childhood , was born to the American tongue and to the language of the Bible and the Constitution ; these , for better or worse , shaped my thought and attitudes and pointed the direction of my talent long before I became a conscious writer . I also inherited a group style originated by a " black " people , but it is Negro American , not African . And it was taught to me by Negroes or copied by me from those among whom I lived most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negroes have a corner on soul . well , we-do n't . You 're right , and anyone who listens to a Beethoven quartet or symphony and ca n't hear soul is in trouble . Maybe they can hear the sound of blackness , but they 're deaf to soul . Richard Wright was called a white man . I 've had something like that happen . When I was teaching at Bard College a young Negro girl approached one of my white colleagues and said , " Is this Mr. Ellison a Negro ? " Now I ca n't understand that ; it sounds like she was putting him on . Because there I was facing classes with my big African nose , teaching American literature and highlighting the frame so that they could become aware of the Negro experience in it ? and she wants to know whether I 'm Negro ! I suppose the social patterns are changing faster than we can grasp . Recently we had a woman from the South who  | helped my wife with the house but who goofed off frequently that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay , but she simply would n't do her work . My friend Albert Murray told me I - Would n't be puzzled over the outcome . " You know how we can be sometimes , " Al said . " She saw the books and the furniture and paintings , so she knew you were some kind of white man . You could n't possibly be a Negro . And so she figured she could get away with a little boondoggling on general principles , because she 'd probably been getting away with a lot of stuff with Northern whites . But what she did n't stop to notice was that you 're a Southern white man ... " So you see , here culture and race and a preconception of how Negroes are supposed to live ? a uestion of taste ? had come together and caused comic confusion . Such jokes as Al Murray 's are meaningful because in America culture is always cutting across racial characteristics and social designations . Therefore , if a Negro does n't exhibit certain attitudes , or if he reveals a familiarity with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste which the observer has failed to note among Negroes , then such confusions in perception are apt to occur . But the basic cause is , I think , that we are all members of a highly pluralistic society . We possess two cultures ? both American ? and many aspects of the broader American culture are available to Negroes who possess the curiosity and taste ? if not the money ? to cultivate them . It is often overlooked , especially in our current state of accelerated mobility , that it is becoming increasingly necessary for Negroes themselves to learn who they are as Negroes . Cultural influences have always outflanked racial discrimination ? wherever and whenever there were Negroes receptive to them , even in slavery times . I read the books which were to free me for my work as a writer while studying at Tuskegee Institute , Macon County , Alabama , during a time when most of the books were n't even taught . Back in 1937 I knew a Negro who swept the floors at Wright Field in Dayton , Ohio , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was working as a porter but his mind , his ambitions , and his attitudes were those of an engineer . He was n't waiting for society to change , he was changing it by himself . What advice would you give to a young person , , r eighteen who was setting out to be a writer ? My first advice would be to make up his mind to the possibility that he might have to go through a period of depriving himself in order to write . I 'd remind him that he was entering into a very stern discipline , and that he should be quite certain that he really wanted to do this to the extent of arranging his whole life so that he could get it done . He should regard writing very much as a young physician is required to regard his period of training . Next , I 'd advise him to read everything , all the good books he can manage , especially those in the literary form in which he desires to become creative . Because books contain the culture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other writers . Here is contained the knowledge which he must have at his fingertips as he projects his own vision . And because without it , no matter how sensitive , intelligent or passionate he is , he will be incomplete . Beyond that , he should n't take the easy escape of involving himself exclusively in talking about writing , or carrying picket signs , or sitting-in as a substitute activity . Because while he might become the best picket in the world , or the best sitterinner , his writing will remain where he left it . Finally , he should avoid the notion that writers require no education . Very often Hemingway and Faulkner are summoned up to support this argument , because they did n't finish college . What is overlooked is that these were very gifted , very brilliant men . And very well-read men of great intellectual capacity . So no matter how you acquire an education , you must have it . You must know your society and know it beyond your own neighborhood or region . You must know its manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know something of what 's happening in the sciences , in religion , in government , and in the other arts . I suppose what I 'm saying is that he should have a working model of the society and of the national characteristics present within his mind . The problem of enriching that model and keeping it up-todate is one of the greatest challenges to the Negro writer , who is , by definition , cut off from firsthand contact with large areas of the society ? especially from those centers where power is translated into ideas and into manners and into values . Nevertheless , this can be an advantage , because in this country no writer should take anything for granted , but must use his imagination to question and penetrate the facade of things . Indeed , the integration of American society on the level of the imagination is one of his basic tasks . It is one way in which he is able to possess his world and , in his writings , help shape the values of large segments of the society which otherwise would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate or to judge .
