If music lives on records , why does ballet die on film ? Why has cinema in two-thirds of a century produced only one picture , The Red Shoes , in which the marriage of camera and choreography did not give birth to a monster ? Three new monsters are currently caged in U.S. movie houses , and their presence offers a painful occasion to inspect and perhaps improve the breed . <P> Cinderella , the screen version of a three-act dance drama scored by Sergei Prokofiev and performed by Moscow 's illustrious Bolshoi Ballet , is a big fat pumpkin of a production that desperately needs to be tapped by a magic wand . Balletically , the show has several left feet : both its choreography and its principals ( Gennady Ledyakh and Raissa Struchkova ) are full of high batterie but a bit obtuse . Cinematically , the show is a raging eyesore . Though filmed in Moscow 's Gorky Studio , Cinderella is designed to suggest a photographed stage production . The palace looks like a set of canvas flats left over from one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 feet the costumes start to look like dirty cheesecloth gone over with a glitter bomb . Furthermore , the picture was shot-sometimes out of focus-in a Russian process that yields a spectrum as subtle as a 29 crayon set . <P> Bolshoi Ballet 67 , another Russian production , is unfortunately photographed in perfect focus . What the onlooker all too clearly sees is a soggy , discolored collection of Russkie zakuski : tidbits from half a dozen Bolshoi ballets ( among them : Paganini , Giselle , The Stone Flower ) served up by some dancers ( among them : Natalia Bessmertnova , Nina Timofeyeva , Mikhail Lavrovjky ) who seem superbly trained but profoundly dispirited-no doubt by the drivel they have to dance . <P> Two styles dominate Bolshoi Ballet 67 . Style No. 1 is lace-hankie romanticism , a mood that proliferates poets with flowing manes , maidens with blowing veils , and violins that burst into orange flame . Style No. 2 is Hollywood 1934 , a taste that makes customers over 40 wonder nervously when Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler will appear at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is the Name . <P> Romeo and Juliet shows what Britain 's Royal Ballet can do with good Russian music ( Prokofiev ) and a great Russian dancer ( Rudolf Nureyev ) . Not much . Choreographer Kenneth Mac-Millan has attempted a compromise between dancing and acting that too often leaves the dancers with nothing to do but klutz around the stage like actors who have forgotten their lines . Director Paul Czinner has attempted almost nothing . With all of London 's Pinewood Studios at his disposal , Czinner stolidly installed eight cameras in eight positions , and stolidly photographed a performance as eight members of the audience might see it-in gravy color . <P> Nevertheless , Romeo and Juliet should not be missed by anybody who cares to see genius shake a leg . The genius is Nureyev ( TIME , April 16 , 1965 ) , who brilliantly reasserts his reputation as the finest male dancer since Nijinsky . In one incredible capriole he soars to his own height and hangs there like a flame in wind . Flame is the essence of his Romeo , a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
