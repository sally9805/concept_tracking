The announcement was truly cosmic . After examining data transmitted from OAO-II , its second Orbiting Astronomical Observatory-which is still functioning effectively after a year in space - NASA this month declared that " astronomers are contemplating the possibility that the universe may be several times larger than previously believed . " And how large is that ? Some 40 billion lightyears* in diameter , concluded newsmen after talking to NASA . Breathlessly they reported that the most distant galaxies might be twice and even four times as far away as anyone had expected . <P> NASA 's assumption was based on OAO-II 's report of unexpectedly powerful ultraviolet radiation from half a dozen nearby galaxies . If this is true , NASA scientists reasoned , distant galaxies probably give off large amounts of the same invisible radiation . But those galaxies are receding from the earth ( because of the expansion of the universe ) at speeds that would cause ultraviolet light to shift toward the red end of the spectrum into visible frequencies . So the NASA men assumed the visible light from distant galaxies is intrinsically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther away . " We thought we were looking at a dim light bulb close to us , " a NASA scientist explained . " But now that we know that the bulb is brighter , we figure it must be more distant . " <P> Pure Chauvinism . Last week leading cosmologists caustically deflated NASA 's universe . " I do n't believe a word of it , " snapped Caltech 's Maarten Schmidt , who in 1963 identified quasars as the most distant objects ever seen by man . " A bunch of nonsense , " said Mount Palomar Astronomer Allan Sandage . " It 's pure chauvinism . " Astrophysicist A. G. W. Cameron of NASA 's own Goddard Institute for Space Studies was equally blunt : " This strikes me as a complete misunderstanding . " <P> In the first place , NASA 's critics pointed out , ultraviolet radiation accounts for no more than a tenth of the radiation from a galaxy . Thus , even a large increase in this component would not greatly affect a galaxy 's overall brightness . Besides , modern astronomers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when viewing distant galaxies and quasars . <P> There are other compelling objections to NASA 's announcement . Most modern astronomers are confident that the technical yardstick by which they measure distant galaxies and quasars-the red shift of light from those bodies-is reasonably accurate . And by that measure , the most distant quasar so far observed by astronomers is about 8 billion light-years away . Furthermore , in the complex Einsteinian geometry of space , diameter is a naive measurement ; normal concepts of shape are meaningless . Astronomers were also nettled by the way that NASA released its information . Ignoring the scientific community , the space agency has to date published its conclusions only in a press release that was issued on the first anniversary of OAO-II 's launch . " Remember , " said Caltech 's Jess Greenstein , " you 're studying a public relations report , not a scientific paper . "
