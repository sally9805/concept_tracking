FOR a chance to observe how the other half is living , the Washington Bureau 's two top campaign reporters switched assignments last week . Burt Meyers , who has been covering Vice President Richard Nixon 's campaign since January , transferred his luggage to the camp of Senator John Kennedy , and Hugh Sidey , a dogged camp follower of Kennedy 's for nine months , joined the Nixon forces . <P> In both campaign parties , the correspondents encountered similar ( and classic ) occupational hazards-scrambling for planes , trains and buses , filing stories from odd places at odder hours , seeking out the nearest shower and jiffy laundry . Both men move fast , Sidey and Meyers agree . " When the candidate stops speaking , " says Meyers , " it 's time to grab your typewriter and start fighting your way to the bus . " Neither reporter had any complaint about the manner in which the press is treated : in each camp , speeches are mimeographed , planes chartered , reservations confirmed and wires dispatched with cool efficiency . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kennedy crew more willing to gossip , to impart tidbits from the inner sanctum , than the Nixon staff . " Though Dick Nixon is always friendly and cheerful with the press , and meets them more often in conferences , there is a curtain of privacy around him when he is not on public display . " The difference , he suspects , is the difference between being <P> Vice President and a Senator : " Nixon has been nearer the top over a long period , and has been burned more . " <P> Reporter Sidey found one small comfort in traveling at Nixon 's side : " At last I 'm allowed to keep a pencil and a comb . It seemed Kennedy kept me stripped of both articles . In the crushes for autographs , Kennedy has never been known to have a pencil of his own . " Another fine point , twangs Iowan Sidey : " It is good to get back with those who speak English . After nine months with all those Boston Irishmen , I was beginning to say ' paaak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ' America . ' " <P> Both men agree on the different eating habits of the two campaign parties . " In three weeks ' campaigning with Dick Nixon , I put on six pounds , " laments Meyers . " In five days with Jack Kennedy-including two days of ' rest ' -I lost 2 . " Sidey 's statistics : 8 lbs . lost with Kennedy , three regained with Nixon . The explanation is a matter of scheduling : Nixon campaigns just as hard as Kennedy , but his stops are spaced between long plane hops , which give the press ample time to eat and write ; Kennedy travels in short flights , is always behind schedule , and the lunch stop is invariably the first item to be cut from the day 's itinerary . A current crack among Kennedy 's lean staffers : " The Senator has said that 17 million Americans go to bed hungry at night , and he expects you to do your part . "                @ @ @ @ @
