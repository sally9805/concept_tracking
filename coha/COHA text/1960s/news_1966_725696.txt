Menace of Supersonic Jets To the Editor : Your Aug. 8 editorial ' ' Supersonic Secrecy " rightly criticizes the President for concealing his decision to give high priority to development of a supersonic airliner . In fact , this project has been conducted from the beginning in a shockingly underhand way . The results of the 1964 sonic boom tests in Oklahoma have not , apparently , been fully disclosed ; and the current tests , as you reported on June 16 and June 21 of this year , are being carried out over the California desert and in an area economically dependent on the aircraft industry , " to help keep the flights from creating public opinion adverse to the superjets . " If the public realized what life would be like in a supersonic age , opinion might indeed be adverse . Dr. Bo Lundberg , head of the Swedish Aeronautical Research Institute , who has made an exhaustive study of the Oklahoma tests , recently reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " as we were given to understand , but were worse than expected . Extent of Boom The " boom carpet " of a superjet is between fifty and eighty miles wide , so that not only cities but most of the once peaceful countryside would be blasted . Furthermore , the boom is intensified by certain atmospheric conditions and can be more than doubled by reflection from walls . Dr. Lundberg therefore concludes that commercial supersonic flights would not merely be nerve-racking for all persons in the " boom carpet " ; there would be intolerable interference with sleep , much physical damage , and many serious accidents . The comfort and safety of millions of people would be sacrificed ' to the convenience of a few travelers . Development of a superjet , therefore , not only would consume huge sums of money better spent to meet urgent social needs ; it would do incalculable damage to a civilized life that is already a precarious condition . To inflict such damage on the people of this and other countries , without full and free discussion and purely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance of payments , should be unthinkable . Let Congress and the general public know the facts , and there is yet hope that this nightmare project may never be realized . ELIZABETH P. BOBISII West Brattleboro , Vt . Aug. 9 , 1966 ? Weapon of Nonviolence To the Editor : It is too bad that S.N.C.C. and CORE have abandoned Martin Luther King 's policy of nonviolence in favor of " black power . " The most potent weapon of any minority group is nonviolence , as was demonstrated by Mahatma Gandhi , William Penn and the early Christians . Unlike the victories of power , it leaves no aftermath of hatred . JOHN H. ARNETT Philadelphia , Aug. 8 , 1966 ? Mayor 's Good Spirits To the Editor : Alas , it was inevitable that a few New Yorkers would view the Central Park lake boating episode with alarm , as expressed in Thomas C. Treeger 's Aug. 6 letter criticiz- : ing Mayor Lindsay and Parks Commissioner Hoving . Mr. Treeger also takes exception to the continued use of the phrase " Fun City . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , voted for Mayor Lindsay . There are differences of opinion as to the results of his leadership thus far . Compassionate people recognize that he has laced hostile political opportunists and that he inherited the chaos of many years of financial folly , but he is a good man , a hard-working , honest and conscientious leader . In the opinion of the writer , time will bring him the city 's approval and gratitude . As for the kill-joys who would prefer a pompous , unsmiling Mayor , let them consider that there is sadness enough in our town and a Mayor with good spirit , who manages to do a job withal , is the best kind of ad we can have to attract visitors to " Fun City . " SILAS F. SEADLER New York , Aug. 6 , 1966 ? U.S.I.A. 's Public Relations Advisers To the Editor : Your editorial about the Unit . ed States Information Agency ( " No Place for Hard Sell , " July 30 ) is misleading and unfair to the agency , which has never espoused or practiced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public relations fraternity as a whole , which , in spite of your conclusion , has never favored the abandonment of the U.S.I.A. policy of telling the truth . On the day Leonard H. Marks was sworn in as director of the agency about a year ago , he instructed U.S.I.A. employes to " tell the truth with professional skill and with objectivity so that the U.S.I.A. will always be a credible and reliable source of information . " He has repeated that policy on a number of occasions since . For many years the U.S.I.A. has welcomed the advice of professional public relations men . To coordinate this assistance , as long ago as 1962 a formalized liaison arrangement was set up with the agency by the Public Relations Society of America , which represents some 5,000 practitioners . Kenneth Youel , a past president of the society and a retired public relations executive of ? General Motors , has served as liaison officer on a voluntary basis . He has an office at the U.S.I.A. , consults regularly with agency officers , and has traveled to Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been assured of the value of the liaison arrangement by three U.S.I.A. directors , Edward R. Murrow , Carl T. Rowan and Leonard H. Marks . Never Makers of Policy The society has a P.R.S.A.-U.S.I.A. liaison committee which meets with the director of the agency and members of his staff , and a smaller task force working on specific projects . In working with the agency , members of our society have never attempted to be policy makers . P.R.S.A. has never urged high-pressure programs . Assistance has been in a variety of ways . Perhaps the most important contribution to the common cause has been the coordination of activities by United States firms ' overseas branches that contribute to U.S.I.A. objectives and make for better understanding of the United States . Public relations men and agency representatives are working together in many parts of the world on projects that are mutually beneficial . In the course of their work , members of the Public Relations Society are pledged to adhere to the society 's codes for professional standards and ethics , which include the affirmative duty of members to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good taste . I trust you will agree this type of contribution to the agency puts the horse before the cart rather than vice versa , as your editorial indicated . Professional public relations advice to the U.S.I.A. has been going on for quite some time . It has not resulted in sky writing or neon signs on the Pyramids , but we feel and hope it has helped the agency do a better job in the professional way it has to be done if it is to succeed . Our society pledges its continued assistance on this basis . ROBERT B. WALCOTT Jr . President Public Relations Society of America New York , Aug. 8 , 1966 ? Pay Raise to Council To the Editor : On Aug. 1 New Yorkers were advised that thirteen libraries would be closed until some time in September . The official reason given was insufficient city funds . On Aug. 2 the City Council voted themselves a salary increase . The official reason given was insufficient funds . The two announcements should not be seen as unrelated . Together they objectify the cavalier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard its citizens . The people of this city , already burdened to a greater degree than most by the cumulative oppressiveness of modern urban existence  --  including pollution of their air and water  --  have recently been told they will assume new tax liabilities . Curtailed Services They have seen prices rising sharply . They have absorbed a 25 per cent increase in public transit rates . All of this and more they have accepted with what might be called a rational stoicism . There has been no major organized protest ; they are apparently willing , as citizens , to " pay certain prices for certain services and " privileges . " But when libraries are closed for lack of funds , and city officials the next day vote themselves salary increases , voices must be raised in protest . Our least negotiable asset  --  our right to learn , to improve ourselves , to want to be better tomorrow than we are today  --  can not be bartered , at any time , to political expediency or avarice . The danger lies not in the closing of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gross rationalization that encourages us to consider this service expendable in a free and democratic society . If , furthermore , the citizens of New York accept with passivity this special poSIX LINES UNHEARD Six deco* lines can make a man immortal Said Ezra Pound .

DIANA DER HOVANESSIAN litical brand of " looting " a city so bankrupt it can not keep its libraries open , they deserve no less than they get . BERT A. KESSLER Laurelton , L. I. , Aug. 4 , 1966 ? Claims for Cars To the Editor : I was interested to read the rebuttal offered Aug. 3 by Gilbert B. Phillips of the Automobile Club of New York to Prof. Mark Haskell 's assertion letter July 16 that motorists are subsidized by - the city .. First Mr. Phillips dismisses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise  --  in any such calculation of cost to the city as " mystical " ; then he proceeds to list a host of indirect benefits  --  jobs , service industries , etc. ? that automobiles bring to the city . I might add that I spent most of 1965 inspecting urban transportation systems in Europe . There , as in Japan , rapid transit construction is proceeding at a fantastic pace . Most of the city planners regard our urban transport policies as symptomatic of " cloud-cuckoo-land . " In Scandinavia , for example , the movement is growing for banning automobiles altogether from the centers of big cities . In the classic phrase , the traffic problem is one of moving people , not moving cars . JOSEPH ASHER Transit Editor , Railway Age New York , Aug. 4 , 1966 ? For Sharing Profits To the Editor : Lasting peace between corporate management and unions can come , not through strike legislation , but through some form of profit-sharing . This is the only way to achieve stability in wages , since labor 's compensation will then be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAVID M. FIGART Briarcliff Manor , N. Y. Aug. 3 , 1966 ? Pro-Labor Bias Charged To the Editor : I wholeheartedly agree with your Aug. 5 editorial " The Demise of the Guideposts . " Predictably but woefully , the Administration has placed politics above the national interest . Its continuous discrimination in favor of labor interests has all but destroyed its case for preaching restraint to business . The effect of the Government 's lack of action to check the current inflation could be serious . Having failed to effect incometax increases at the beginning of this year , it was essential that the Administration stick impartially to its wage-price guideposts to stave off serious inflation . It appears now that we are entering a period of slackening economic growth accompanied by continuing price increases . To bring to bear restraining fiscal policies now ( or after the election ) may risk a recession in the private sector of the economy , with its undesirable effects on employment and income . But how else to hold back inflation ? The Administration seems to be painting itself into a corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Aug. 8 , 1966
