txt ALBANY , Feb. ** sponsors of the divorce-reform bill said today that a poll of their colleagues in the Assembly showed overwhelming support for the bill . Assemblymen Percy E. Sutton , Democrat of Manhattan , and L. Richard Marshall , Republican of Elmira , said they had polled about two-thirds of the Assemblymen so far and sentiment was running more than four to one for the bill . As the bill 's sponsors claimed majority support for the measure , the formation of a Committee of Catholic Citizens to Support Divorce Reform in New York State was disclosed in New York City . Its members include City Council President Frank D. O'Connor and State Supreme Court Justice William Lawless of Buffalo . In a separate statement made in New York , Mr. O'Connor said he favored " full and open debate " so that " a realistic bill " could be passed . " As a Catholic , " Mr. O'Con // nor said , " I do not believe in divorce , but I believe also that we can not superimpose our theological opinion on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting on revision of the law could " serve only to prejudice " those dedicated to a new era " in the whole gamut of church-state relations . " Support also came from the New York Board of Rabbis , which said it was " deeply distressed at opposition to amending New York State divorce laws . " " We strongly support present efforts of our State Legislature to review and amend present laws to provide for additional grounds for divorce than is presently permitted , " the board said in a statement . The results of the poll , disclosed by Mr. Marshall in a telephone interview from Elmira and by Mr , Sutton in a news conference here , were viewed as an effort to counteract an impression that the bill was in trouble . Yesterday , Senator Jerome L. Wilson , Democrat of Manhattan and another of the bill 's sponsors , made an angry speech charging that a letter sent to all legislators by the spokesman for the Roman Catholic Church in New York was " seemingly a declaration of war " against divorce reform and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter came from Charles J. Tobin Jr. , secretary of the New York State Catholic Welfare Committee , which represents the Church on all statewide matters . It called on the Legislature not to take any immediate action and contended that many groups , which were not named , would be " seriously disappointed and critical of the proposal . " Senator Wilson charged : " Mr. Tobin has killed divorce deleted 13 lines though not fatal to divorce-law reform at this session , " certainly did n't help the bill . " Assemblyman Sutton said his survey " by no means leads to a feeling of despair , as has been reported from other quarters in today 's newspapers . " He added : " I am so heartened by the support found so far that I am not unduly disturbed by the widely advertised opposition . " Mr. Sutton also said he did not view Mr. Tobin 's letter as indicating a " fight to the finish . " The Harlem legislator said that he had polled 73 Assemblymen of varying religious backgrounds , most of them from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated opposition . Mr. Marshall said that he had polled 40 of his colleagues , mostly from upstate , and that the ratio of support had been about the same as among the city-area legislators . The Elmira Republican added , however , that if the Catholic hierarchy took a strong stand against the bill , many of the deleted 13 lines
