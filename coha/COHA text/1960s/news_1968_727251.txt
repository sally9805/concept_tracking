txt Mitchell I. Ginsberg , the city 's Human Resources Administrator , said yesterday that recent demands by welfare clients were costing $10-million to $12-million a month in special grants . He said that a new flatgrant system was " desperately needed . " According to the city Social Services Department , the basic allowance for a family of four now averages S272.50 a month , including rent . The special grant is for some unanticipated expense above this , aside from , emergency grants necessitated by such things as fire or theft . Two new moves in the client drive , which began in April , were scheduled today : a set of " fair hearings " before a state referee to obtain a telephone for every relief recipient on health and safety grounds , and a demonstration seeking to block work at welfare centers . Income Guarantee Sought Hulbert James , director of the Citywide Coordinating Commit , tee of Welfare Groups , said ' the " campaign of further disruption " was aimed at replacing the welfare system by some form of guaranteed annual income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should be " close to ' $6,000 a year " for a family of four . Mr. James saki the specialgrant costs were leaping because of a campaign lie mapped . In April , welfare clients demanded grants for spring clothing . Then came demands for special clothing grants for Mother 's Day , and for school graduations . Now the clients are demanding grants for camp clothing , which Mr. James said should be S68 for a boy and $72 for a girl . A new state law authorizes relief grants to pay for summer camping vacations for some children , with guidelines still being worked out . Teen-agers organized by the United Community Centers of Brooklyn helped achieve passage of the law , going beyond clothing grants previously given to youngsters attending camps sponsored by philanthropic groups . Rate Would Be Higher On the WNBC-TV " Searchlight " telecast yesterday , Mr. Ginsberg said special grants were issued to meet minimum standards set by the state . " It 's a very complicated , very cumbersome system , " Mr. Ginsberg said , " impossible in my judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many bobby pins you should have based on how old you are . " It 's outmoded . It 's practically not in existence anywhere else in the country . And we are long since overdue for a change . " The simplified flat grant , set at a level higher than the present basic allowance , would replace the present system except for emergencies . It would eliminate investigations and decisions on the merits of a client 's demand , freeing caseworkers for counseling . Mr. Ginsberg said he and Jack R. Goldberg , city Social Services Commissioner , believed that " this city can not continue to administer its welfare system with any degree of effectiveness or efficiency under the present system for very long . " The state Social Services Department has favored a flatgrant move , in part because of the soaring costs in New York City . But it reported last week that any change was being held up because the budget division said a new appropriation by the Legislature would be needed . The new drive for telephones is being led by the United Welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coordinating Committee . Mr. James said all the affiliates had 6,000 to 7,000 members . Only about a fifth of relief recipients have telephones , Mr. . Tames said , and they have them Ior medical reasons . He said about 30 had filed for " fair bearings , " which will start this morning at 117 Liberty Street . ) In these hearings , clients whose demands have been turned down by caseworkers take their appeal before a state ' referee . There used to be perhaps 50 such " fair hearings " a year , Mr. James said , adding that the welfare groups sponsored 3,000 last August and October to demand compliance with minimum need standards . He estimated that each fair hearing cost the state S300 a day . On a " WMCA Reports " radio broadcast last night , Dr. George Wiley , director of the nationwide Poverty Rights Action Center of welfare clients , said all 30 million Americans considered to be below a Federally set poverty levet should be on relief rolls , instead of only 8.5-million as at present . The poverty line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a nonfarm family of four . Mr. Ginsberg said yesterday he agreed with Wilbur J. Cohen , Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , who proposed Friday that the Federal Government take over welfare programs . f In an interview , he said one heartening development here had been the graduation of 550 persons , formerly on relief or unemployed or underemployed , from six-month courses under a federally financed program . The graduates become nurses ' aides for the Health Services Administration at ** a year or case aides for the Social Services Department at $4,250 a year .
