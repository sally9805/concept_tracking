The symptoms are turning up everywhere . A commuter puts down his paper and his eyes glaze as if with some interior rapture ; a stenographer stops typing and stiffens in her chair ; waiting for the children 's hamburgers to brown , a housewife suddenly presses her hands on the kitchen table until the knuckles show white . These are not the victims of some new virus , nor has the strain of modern living sent them around the bend . Instead , they are practicing the very latest wrinkle in body culture : isometrics . <P> Miracle from a Frog 's Leg . The basic principle of isometric exercise was discovered back in the ' 20s , when scientists found that when one leg of a frog was tied down over a period of time , it grew significantly stronger than the leg left free . But it was not until 1953 that two German doctors worked out the implications of this experiment and applied them to the human body . <P> Traditional exercise , known as " isotonic , " beefs up a muscle by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does not move the muscle at all ; the exercises are all performed against an immovable object . By this immobile contraction , its adherents claim , nearly 100% of the muscle 's thousands of hairlike fibers are stimulated-as compared with the mere 50% to 60% involved in isotonic exercise . <P> Athletes use a variety of bars , braces and frames that can be adjusted to just the right inch or angle to strengthen a muscle for a particular job ( one high jumper successfully trained by straining against a device that held his take-off leg at the exact angle from which it started its spring ) . The Green Bay Packers were one of the first major pro football teams to adopt isometrics , and some credit the exercises for their brilliant seasons in 1961 and 1962 , after which other teams caught on-and caught up . " It 's the greatest thing the world has ever seen , " rhapsodizes Olympics Weight-Lifting Coach Bob Hoffman . " I am absolutely awestruck at the miracles it has wrought . " A millionaire manufacturer of gym equipment , Hoffman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devices . He has seen about 50 competing firms climb on the bandwagon just within the past four years . <P> No Sweat . But ordinary laymen need no equipment at all-and precious little time . They may even resculpture their bodies while doing something else without attracting undue attention . To take one inch to three inches off the paunch in a mere month : 1 ) inhale deeply , pushing out the abdomen as far as possible and holding it there one second ; 2 ) exhale , pull the abdomen in as far as it will go and hold it there for six seconds ; 3 ) repeat six times a day in any position . <P> Executives can build up their biceps when their secretaries are n't looking simply by sitting up straight , sliding their open palms against the underside of their desks , and pushing up for six seconds . They can reripple their arm , chest and shoulder muscles by giving six-second pushes of one fist into the other hand . Their wives can firm up their thighs by standing with feet spraddled widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum tension for six seconds , three times a day .
