txt George Meany looked back today at six years of labor unity ; and found just one reason for dissatisfaction  --  the failure of big unions to organize the unorganized . In an interview the president of the American Federation of , Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations blamed the industrial and building trades unions . " As far as I know , " he said , " none of these unions has an organizing campaign going . I do n't know why the United Automobile Workers are n't organizing in their own jurisdiction . I do n't know why the United Steelworkers are n't . The same thing is true of the building trades . " When the A. F. L.-C , was formed in 1955 , after twenty years of divorce , Mr. Meany recalled , high hopes were expressed for the future of the labor movement , particularly by Walter P. Reuther , head of the auto union , At the merger there were 14,000,000 dues-paying members . Two years later the federation lost 1,500,000 when it expelled the Teamsters Union and two other affiliates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -1 500,000 . Despite labor 's failure to keep pace with the country 's growth and the increase in the work force , now estimated to total ) 72,000,000 , Mr. Meany refused , to show panic . " The A.F.L.-C.I.O. is not falling apart , " he declared . " I have never seen any signs of it . " He said he had no intentions , of singling out as laggards such leaders as Mr. Reuther , Al J. Hayes , head of the International Association of Machinists , or David J. , head of the United Steelworkers . But he noted that the auto union had a strike fund of more than $55,000,000 " lying around , " while at the same time it was laying off organizers . " There is no sense in piling up all that money if it can be used , " he commented . He suggested that " the only time some organizations get busy is when an outsider comes into their territory . " He called for an end to such interunion conflicts and the start of a " concentrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Meany said that Jack Livingston , the federation 's national director of organization , had tried in vain to get cooperation from several unions in organizing 75,000 du Pont workers . The chemical industry was one of the areas marked out by the federation six years ago for future organizing . Even where unions try to win members , Mr. Meany said , they are faced with intervention from brother groups . For example , he said , in the Cincinnati area an industrial union has been moving in on a " real live campaign " conducted by the steel union to organize 35,000 workers in fourteen plants . He did not name the intervening union , but it is known to be the International Union of Electrical Workers , headed by James B. Carey . The federation is powerless to do anything about such conflicts , he said , but it is better that way . He explained that the merged group had a force of about 140 national organizers , but that he could never assign them to areas where a contest was on between two affiliates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' You get out , ' " Mr. Meany declared . " But I do n't buy the suggestion that we should change our rules so we can move in on these situations . " It 's much more important to keep peace in the family than to organize , if you have to make that choice . We would n't gain anything by impdsing our wishes on anyone . That policy would bring disaster . " Gompers was right when he said he would n't like to see every worker in America in a trade union . If that happened , we would have to spend all our time keeping the peace and we 'd accomplish nothing . " Samuel Gompers was the founder and first president of the A. F. L. Mr. Meany said he hoped the federation would be able to work out an arrangement at the convention under which he could " get the larger unions organizing and out of each other 's hair . " He indicated that jurisdictions could be set up on locality or geographical lines , with the federation acting in an advisory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
