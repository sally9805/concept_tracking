Guy Astruc should have been concentrating on the road as he drove along the icy edge of the Lot River in southwestern France . But Astruc is a spelunker , always on the lookout for potholes to pop into . To him , the little frost-free spot he saw in a limestone cliff suggested a cave entrance that had become plugged up . He stopped to probe the spot with a crowbar . Stones and dirt caved in ; warm air whooshed out . Suddenly Astruc was staring into a narrow tunnel . " I was alone , " he says , " afraid to go in very far , or stay very long . " <P> Stomach Crawlers . Astruc came back with fellow members of the Quercy Speleological Club of Cahors . They all crawled headfirst into the hole , soon found themselves in a passageway no more than 20 in. high . Exhaling to squeeze between rocks , rubbing their noses in the wet clay , they inched along . Then one of them saw carvings on the ceiling . <P> Next day the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The more they searched the cave , the more paleolithic art they found . In all , close to 80 drawings were scratched into the rock . Among them were six deer , one complete horse and the heads or bodies of five others , an antelope , three handsome and complete bison , a bull , some mountain goats , and a catlike creature . Cavemen , it is believed , made images of the animals they hunted to gain power over them . There was a triangular fertility symbol , and one clearly visible figure of a man , headless , but obviously male . <P> Earth Movers . French Archaeologists place the ancient art work in two distinct periods . The first , Aurignacian , is roughly 25,000 to 30,000 years old , the other , Magdalenian , dates from 15,000 to 20,000 years ago . With the drawings fully authenticated ( a thick layer of limy deposit , like candle wax , covers many of them , dismissing the possibility of a modern hoax ) , the cave is rated as a major archaeological find . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposely put in as cramped a space as possible in a sort of protective return to the womb . Though in an area famous for its subterranean paintings , its very magic may keep the new underground art gallery from ever becoming a tourist attraction . Only the hardiest visitors could crawl down to see the treasures 320 ft. below the surface of the Lot Valley .
