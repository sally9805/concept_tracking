txt President Kennedy appealed tonight for support " in the national interest " of a tax reduction that he said was both " insurance for prosperity and insurance against recession , " In a nationwide television aadress , the President held out to the consumer the hope of " a new car , a new home , new conveniences , education and investment . " To the businessman Mr. Ken ! nedy said the tax cut would mean that he could " keep a higher percentage of his profits in his cash register , or put it to work expanding or improving his business . " To the unemployed he said that " more after-tax money means more buying power for consumers and investors , and this means more production and the jobs our nation needs , " Sees Downturn Blocked To all , Mr. Kennedy promised that his tax program , if enacted promptly , would enable the nation to " release $11 billion of extra after-taxes purchasing power into the private economy before another downturn can begin . " Thus , Mr. Kennedy said , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recession . " It would also mean , he said , a slowdown in the flow of American gold abroad , a strengthened American dollar all around the world and new markets for American business . Taking note of widespread opposition to a tax cut enacted without commensurate reduction in Federal spending , Mr. Kennedy said : " No wasteful , inefficient or unnecessary government activity will be tolerated . We are pledged to a course of true fiscal responsibility , leading to a balanced budget in a bal- anted full-employment economy ! , Federal outlays , he said , will be limited " to only those activities which are fully essential to the nation . " Mr. Kennedy , in the address broadcast by all major networks at 7 P.M. , Eastern Daylight Time , pointed out that the tax reduction program would be voted on by . the House of Representatives next week and said : " I strongly urge you to support this bill for your family 's sake and for your country 's sake . " The Administration program , as modified and approved by the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House Rules Committee today , provides for a total net tax reduction of $11 billion a year when fully effective , Of this total , about $8.7 billion would be in individual income taxes and $2.3 billion in corporate income taxes . About $5.6 billion , or twothirds of the individual reduction , and about $1.4 billion , or roughly one-half of the corporate reduction  --  a total of $7 billion  --  would become effective on income earned beginning Jan. 1 , 1964 . The balance would go into effect a year later . The program differs in many details but is largely similar in its predicted economic impact to the program President Kennedy originally submitted . That would have provided a net yearly tax reduction , effective in three annual stages , of about $10 billion . But a number of structural reforms Mr. Kennedy proposed for the tax system , which would have offset the over-all tax cut somewhat by plugging so-called loopholes , were discarded by the Ways and Means Committee . The version now under consideration in the House would cut the . corporate tax rate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent in 1965 . The tax rate on individual incomes would be cut by an average of 20 per cent , with two-thirds of the cuts effective in 1964 and the rest in 1965 . Individual rates would range from 14 to 70 per cent , as compared to the present 20 to 91 per cent . Mr. Kennedy gave the following examples of how the program would work , if enacted in the form now pending in Congress : " A factory worker with three dependents earning $90 a week will have his taxes reduced by one-third . " The typical American family ? a father , mother and two children  --  earning about $6,000 a year , now pays an annual income tax of $600 . This bill will cut that tax by 25 per cent . " A salaried employe with a wife and two children , who earns $8,000 a year , will receive a tax cut of more than 20 per cent that will enable him to pay the installments on a new dishwasher for his wife . " But the most important benefits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole , " in the following manner : As individuals spend their increased after-tax dollars , " the businesses which serve them need to hire more men . " " The men who are hired have more money to spend , " he went on . " The companies who sell these items have more incentive to invest , to improve and to expand the operations . More young people out of school will find work . And the danger of recession is less . " Mr. Kennedy also emphasized his belief that a tax cut would help solve racial problems by providing new jobs for Negroes ? who make up a large portion of the unemployed . The President made it plain that he did not expect easy passage of the bill . Opposition in both pparties has centered on the A tration 's refusal to make spend . ing cuts that would reduce the budget deficit expected to result from tax reduction . In the House , the Republican leadership plans to offer a proposal that would prevent the tax reductions from taking effect if Mr. Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spading totals of more than $97 billion in the current fiscal year and more than $98 billion in the next fiscal year , ending June 30 , 1965 . As now forecast , both esti ? mates would exceed those figurea . Mr. Kennedy did not mention the Republican proposal tonight , but at one point he spoke scathingly of those who wanted to attach " ruinous amendments " to the tax bill . " They want to deny our country the full benefits of tax reduction because , they say , there is waste in government , " he asserted . " There may be , and we are working to get rid of it  --  but let us not forget the waste in 4,000,000 unemployed men and women , with the prospect of still more unemployment if this bill does not pus .
