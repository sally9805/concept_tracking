Hope in Plaster <P> " We have a patient . We have placed him in a plaster cast . We keep him there until the wound heals , " said Premier George Papadopoulos , the colonel who is strongman of the current Greek military regime . He was only trying to explain why civil and political liberties in Greece remain suspended under martial law . But it was the sort of metaphor that appealed quite naturally to Assemblagist Vlassis Canairis , 40 , who studied medicine at Athens University before turning to the practice of painting and sculpture in 1950 . The exhibition that he has mounted in Athens ' small " New Gallery " illustrates its vividness , though not in the way that Papadopoulos intended . <P> The dominant work on display is a tableau featuring eight torsolike constructions made of wire netting swathed in plaster , lined up against a wall painted to look like a strikingly blue Greek sky . The figures are bound to the wall by strands of concentration-camp barbed wire . Another piece consists of a plaster " torso " wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the posture of a crucifix . Two or three blood-red cloth carnations sprout from the jacket 's inside pockets . Still another assemblage presents a shoe embedded in a plaster block . Where the toe dared to protrude from the block , it is chopped off in procrustean fashion ; a carnation sprouts from the gaping hole . <P> Canairis maintains that " I never get involved in politics . My message ? Simply that where death is , there is also life . " To visitors who come to the gallery , he passes out small square blocks of white plaster with a carnation embedded in each . Despite only two guarded references in the censored Greek press , Athenians have made their way to the gallery in droves . They come in twos and threes , solemn , quiet , and most make their comments in whispers . But a few have been more outspoken . Said one young man : " The wire will be snapped off , the plaster will break , and the carnation will give off its perfume again . " Added a university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the regime : " Let us hope that by next spring flowers will be able to bloom again from the earth , and not from plaster . " <P> Canairis himself is discreetly noncommittal . Said he : " Let each keep the message that suits him . "
