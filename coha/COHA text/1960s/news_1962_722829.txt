txt Britain has made a proposal to the Euro pean Economic Community that , if accepted , should greatly improve the chances of the United States and other outside nations to maintain a large volume of agricultural exports to the community . Acceptance of the proposal would also greatly ease British entry into the Common Market , although it would not solve all problems . There is some chance that it will he accepted by the six members of the Economic Community . The proposal involved the key question of the price of grain . It was made in connection with the search for a solution of the most difficult problem in Britain 's application for entry into the Common Market , that of switching British agriculture over to the new Common Market farm system . For outsiders , the ultimate level of the Common Market single grain price will be decisive , far more important than the new Common Market farm system itself . If the grain price is low , production will expand only modestly and there will still be room for a big volume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community , particularly in France , will expand greatly and gradually squeeze out imports . The effect of the new British proposal would be to improve the odds on a lower price . While few major British proposals have been accepted in the long negotiations , and there has been no clear sign that this one will be accepted , acceptance can not be ruled out . The Common Market nations have been unanimous in insisting that Britain switch to the Common Market farm system at a single stroke , shortly after her entry . A current joint factual study of the implications of such a move has immediately concentrated on the effect on Britain 's wheat price . Britain now permits imports to flow freely and lets market prices for grain fall where they will . Then she pays her own farmers a cash subsidy to make up the difference between the market price and a theoretical " warranted " price . The result is that the British market prices are the lowest in the world , but farm income is assured . Under the Common Market system the farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market . The market price is kept up to an agreed level by Government buying when necessary . deleted 27 lines price would be a tremendous incentive to British farmers to grow wheat , even to the point , it is contended , of plowing pasture land . The British negotiators argue that this would be stupid and harmful , harmful ' even to France 's chances of exporting wheat to Britain . Thus they have made their new proposals . This is that Britain , in switching over to the Common Market system , be allowed to adopt a support price about the same as the present guaranted price . The British price would then be the community 's lowest , pending the time when a single price is adopted . British farmers would have the same income as before , but no incentive to grow more wheat . No community rule would be violated . The importance of the suggestion , for outsiders is that it would automatically widen the " fork " suparating the community 's lowest price from its highest , that in West Germany. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bringing prices together began. , The ultimate compromise price would tend to be lower .
