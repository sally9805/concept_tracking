It was n't a Black Monday on Wall Street , but it was dark grey . <P> On the first day of trading last week , the Dow-Jones industrial average went down by 16.32 points-the most precipitate plunge since the day of John F. Kennedy 's assassination . Throughout the rest of the week , the market tried bravely to rally , failed , and ended up at a Dow-Jones average of 847.38 , a new low for the year , and down 148 points , or 15% , from Feb. 9 's peak of 995.15 . The Big Board 's new flattened-out index ( TIME , July 22 ) slipped one point to 45.29 , or 2% . The Dow-Jones rail average also hit a 1966 low of 220.26 , a fact that immediately led some pessimists to recall a Wall Street adage to the effect that when industrials and rails establish new lows in tandem , it is a sure sign of a bear market . <P> <P> Actually , what had happened to the market ? There were as many answers as questions about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by second-quarter earnings reports ( see following story ) . The fact is that , no matter how successful Lyndon Johnson may be politically , an increasing number of investors distrust his Administration 's fiscal policies . Despite inflation and the rising cost of the war in Viet Nam , the Administration refuses to cut Great Society benefits ; instead there is continuing talk about rescinding the law that now allows U.S. corporations to claim a 7% tax rebate on outlays for expansion . <P> Stock investors are therefore nervous - as witness the fact that even the mutual funds were staying relatively clear of Wall Street . According to second-quarter reports , the mutuals have some $2.3 billion waiting to be invested . This represents about 61% of their assets in cash and marketable securities , the highest ratio since 1962 . <P> Last week came an example of why some people are sensitive about Government fiscal policy . The Treasury Department announced that , in order to refinance part of the national debt ( $320 billion ) , it was now offering to the public $8 billion worth of notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes carry a 51% interest rate , the highest since 1921 . This might seem attractive to a lot of U.S. citizens-but , as U.S. taxpayers , they will eventually be footing the bill for the higher interest .
