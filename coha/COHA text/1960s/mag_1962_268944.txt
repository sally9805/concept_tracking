In Moscow last week , amid quiet vodka toasts and cries of Mnogie leta ! ( Many years of life ) , Nikita Sergeevich Khrushchev turned 68 . Unlike Joseph Stalin , whose birthdays became vast public orgies of obeisance , Khrushchev celebrates his anniversaries in private . In fact , he had little reason to celebrate-and was under doctor 's orders not to . Though four years younger than Stalin at the time of his death , Khrushchev has high blood pressure and a heart condition . Moscow rumors persist that he suffered a stroke in recent months ; twice , after absences that were officially attributed to flu , Nikita has himself told friends that he suffered a more serious ailment . He has markedly curtailed his social calendar , is on the wagon and a strict diet , and at diplomatic functions seldom seems compelled these days to act the life and soul of the Party . <P> He remains nonetheless an exceptionally energetic man for his years . After an interview with Khrushchev that lasted nearly three hours , Look Publisher Gardner Cowles said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in extremely good , vigorous health . " Khrushchev himself assured the 14th Congress of the Young Communist League : " I am working overtime . According to Soviet law I already have the right not to work . Where must I spend the energy ? Must I take it to the grave with me ? No . All the energy must be put into work for the welfare of society . " Indeed , it was not health but history that deserted Nikita Khrushchev in his 68th year . Early in the year , he declared truculently that he would sign a peace treaty with East Germany by year 's end . <P> Last week , nearly four months after his deadline , talks continued in Washington on the Berlin issue ; Dean Rusk seemed ready to offer Russian Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin some of the semi-concessions that the U.S. had suggested before* but stood firm on all essentials . Khrushchev 's boldest move in 1961 was to raise the Berlin Wall ; today it seems less like a master stroke than a monument to the misery of 100 million souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by exploding 120 megatons last fall , Khrushchev merely goaded the U.S. to end its own three-year moratorium on testing . Even Khrushchev 's compelling space triumphs have paled since the U.S. gave the world a ringside seat for John Glenn 's flight . <P> Paper Utopia . In Khrushchev 's script , the crowning achievement was to have been last October 's 22nd Party Congress at which delegates from 81 Communist nations dutifully ratified the Khrushchev Code , a glittering prospectus for Communism 's future by which Nikita hoped to add Khrushchevism to Marxism-Leninism . Yet his paper utopia seemed impossibly remote to most Russians . As a thundering anticlimax , Khrushchev in March unveiled his new blueprint for agriculture , leaving no doubt that the inertia and inefficiency of Russia 's farm system will not be overcome in Khrushchev 's lifetime , if ever .
