Last summer 's macabre mass murders in Chicago and Austin seemed irresistibly fascinating to Robert Benjamin Smith , 18 , studious , reticent high school senior in Mesa , Ariz. ( pop . 50,000 ) . Three months ago , Bob Smith began to concoct his own nightmarish schemes for multiple murder . After toying with several other likely sites , he settled on the Rose-Mar College of Beauty , a mile and a half from his home , because of the number of potential victims-student beauticians and housewife customers-to be found there . <P> His plan was to bind the women , tie plastic bags over their heads , and watch them while they suffocated . After mulling it over for weeks , he set out from his home early one morning last week with a brown paper bag containing 200 ft. of nylon cord , a package of big plastic sandwich bags , two hunting knives and , for good measure , a .22-cal. , single-action six-shooter that his parents had given him . <P> Wheel of Death . Once inside the school , Smith brandished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired one shot into a mirror and ordered everyone there-five women , a three-year-old girl and a baby-into a back room . One woman shouted , " There 'll be 40 people here in a few minutes . " Smith replied : " I 'm sorry , but I did n't bring enough ammunition for them . " He found to his dismay that the sandwich bags were too small to pull over a person 's head , but he still had his knives and his pistol . So Smith ordered his victims to lie down in a circle like spokes in a wheel-their heads at the center , their feet on the perimeter . <P> They complied . As unconcernedly as if he were taking potshots at pop bottles , Smith squeezed off his bullets , aiming carefully at the head of each person . Mrs. Joyce Sellers , 27 , mother of the two children in the circle , lurched about after he had shot her , so Smith stabbed her in the back to be certain she was dead . <P> " Popping Noises . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the school , entered the building , heard a man 's voice and " funny popping noises " coming from the back room . She called the police , who arrived to arrest Smith while he was still standing not far from the bloody bodies of his victims . <P> The young killer blithely announced , " I wanted to get known , just wanted to get myself a name , " then reconstructed his crime before horrified policemen . But there was little to say . Mrs. Sellers and her daughter , Debra , 3 , were dead on the floor ; three other women died a short time later ; another lay in serious condition in the hospital . The baby , Tamara Lynn Sellers , had been shot in the arm , but survived because her mother 's body had shielded her from Smith 's bullets .
