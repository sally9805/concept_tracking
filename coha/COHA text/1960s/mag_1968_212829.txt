The Israelis have strict rules forbidding amateur archaeologists from poking around the digs and carting off whatever strikes their fancy . But who 's to say no when the amateur happens to be Defense Minister Moshe Dayan , 52 , hero of all Israel and avid collector of artifacts for his private backyard museum . So there he was again last week , burrowing into an ancient tomb at Azor , near Tel Aviv , and this dig almost ended in tragedy . Dayan was six feet down in a pit when the soft clay walls suddenly gave way , burying the general under their weight . Bystanders dug him out within a minute , rushed him to a hospital , where he was found to be suffering from two broken ribs , a fractured vertebra and possibly a damaged aorta . At week 's end , though , doctors reported him out of danger and growling , " When do I get out of here ? " <P> Men 's plumages are changing so fast that the lads hardly have time to preen their feathers any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for Rudolf Nureyev , 30 . Not that Rudi is all that wild about horses . It 's just that he has this gas about things South American ; so naturally that led to an Yves St. Laurent Argentine pony-skin jacket to set off a dashing pair of matching boots by Paris ' Roger Vivier . Gaucho Rudi wears the getup whenever the mood strikes him , as with Dame Margot Fonteyn and Princess Margaret at a Knightsbridge mansion , where the Princess helped kick off a fund-raising campaign to provide new facilities for the Royal Academy of Dancing . <P> <P> In a way it was typical that when Charles Lindbergh made his first public appearance in a decade , he chose one of the nation 's farthest reaches . Lindy , now 66 , was in Juneau to address the Alaska legislature on a topic touching him deeply : the need to conserve the state 's wildlife . The Lone Eagle argued that Alaska should do away with bounties on wolves , coyotes and seals , and make it illegal for hunters to shoot from airplanes or trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , " said he . " But with extreme changes taking place , the people are in danger of losing the environment they inherited from all times past . " The lawmakers gave him a standing ovation , and Lindy responded with a wave and a grin that , for a moment , bridged 41 years . <P> <P> For seven years the royal palace in Oslo had been without a woman-ever since King Olav V 's youngest daughter , Astrid , married a commoner . But now the King and Crown Prince Harold , 31 , will no longer live in lonely masculine splendor . The King has consented to Harald 's marriage to Sonja Har-aldsen , 30 , the striking blonde daughter of an Oslo clothing-store manager whom Harald courted for ten years . Royalists were soon aflutter over the fact that Sonja , a commoner , will receive queenly rights when Harald ascends the throne . That issue hardly concerned the Prince . " For me , " said he , " Sonja will just be my wife . " <P>      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
