OUR carefree life of gaiety and games fell apart the moment my mother died . In the summer of 1933 , when we went to Zubalovo , I found that the playground in the woods with its hoops and swings and its Robinson Crusoe tree house had vanished . The only things left were traces of sand in the woods . Our governess ; Natalia Konstantinovna , left right away , My brother 's tutor , Aleksandr Muravyov , lasted another two years . My father moved to a different apartment because he could n't bear to stay in the one my mother had died in . It was most uncomfortable to live in . It was on the first floor of the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long corridor . It had walls nearly five feet thick and high , vaulted ceilings , His time for seeing me and Vasily was during dinner at the apartment . He would ask me about my lessons , look at the dayhook in which my marks were entered and would sometimes ask me to show my exercise books , By 1937 or 1938 , except for my nurse , there was no one left of the people my mother had found , of the people who loved and respected her . All of them gradually vanished . One year I came back for school in September to find that our old took , veto , was gone , Later they got rid of Tanya . a big woman who used to carry the licavv kitchen trays , Finally our housekeeper , Carolina Till , left too . Now the whole household was run at state expense . The size of the staff , or " service personnel , " as they called it to avoid the old bourgeois word " servants , " increased enormously . At each of my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodyguards , each with a chief of its own , two cooks and a double staff of waitresses and cleaning women . Of course , they automatically became employes of the G. P. U. as the secret police was still known . IN 1939 , when people were still disappearing right and left , somebody came up with the information that my nurse 's husband , whom she left during World War I , had been a clerk in the Czarist police before the Revolution . They told my father that my nurse was " untrustworthy " and that her son had undesirable friends . My father had no time to go into these things himself . He liked people to bring such matters to his attention when they had " closed their case . " Having heard there was a plot afoot to get rid of my nurse , I set up a howl , My father could n't stand tears . He got angry and commanded them to leave my nurse in peace . No household had such an official , even quasi-military atmosphere as ours . None was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sergei Yefimov , who was superintendent at Zubalovo while my mother was still aliye , wastransferred , to my father 's at Kuntsevo . He had at least some vestiges of human feeling towardus.as.a.family . Toward the end of . my father 's lifetime Yefimov , a general . in thesecret police by thAt fell- out of favor with him . He was d-atiti repove " eaten alive " by his colleagues , the other generals and . colonels of the police who constituted a peculiar kind of " court " around my father . T MUST mention anothen general , Nikolai Vlasik , who I was first assigned to my father by the Red Army as a bodyguard in 1919 and remained with him for a very long time , finally attaining immense power behind the scenes . He was in charge of all my father 's security arrangements and considered himself closer to my father than anybody else . And though he was incredibly stupid , illiterate and uncouth , he behaved like a grandee and took it on himself in my father 's last years to dictate " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the eve of Nov. 7 , or state banquet in St. George 's hall of the Kremlin was allowed to take place wIthont Vlasik 's passing on the program first . While my mother was alive he was a member of ni  --  dther 's bodyguard , and never set foot in the house . Later , however , lia. ? ? t was a ? permanent . fixture at Kuntsevo . From there , he ran all mylather 's other residences . My father had two other places outside Moscow . They were Lipki , an ancient estate on the Dmitrov Highway with a pond , a wonderful house and an enormous park lined with tall lindens , and Semyonovskoye , a fine n 1 ; 4 efota Our new Kremlin housekeeper , Aleksandra Nakashidze , a lieutenant ( later major ) in the secret police , appeared in 1937 or 1938 through the good offices of Beria , to whom she was related . At first , being only 11 or 12 , I was too young to appreciate how grotesque it was to have Beria 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote from all of us . Once in a while he gave our unofficial guardian Vlasik overall directives on how we were to be brought up . AGOVERNESS named Lidia Georgiyevna appeared on the scene about the time I first went to school . She was very small and hunchbacked , with dyed red hair . She and my nurse got into a fight the very first day . She " brought me up " for five years , turning up every day to make my life a torment . After five years I implored my father to get rid of her . My father had no special sympathy for a hunchbacked old maid who flirted with every man in sight and I was set free of her . Starting in 1937 someone decided that a plainclothesman was to follow at my heels everywhere I went , to the country , the theater , to and from school every day . The first was an emaciated , jaundiced-looking man , Ivan Krivenko . He was quickly replaced by a fat , selfimportant looking man named Aleksandr Volkov , who bit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same cloakroom as everybody else , I had to use a special little room next to the school office to which I would go blushing with embarrassment . I had to have lunch brought from home and sat in a little corner , screened off from my friends . Next I had a kind , quiet man by the name of Mikhail Klimov . He trudged faithfully behind me from 1940 to 1943 , when the job was abolished altogether . I was in my first year at the university by then . I told my father I was ashamed to go there with this " tail . " Apparently my father realized how absurd the whole thing was . He was just back from the Teheran Conference in December , 1943 , and was in a particularly good frame of mind . He simply said : " To hell with you , then . Get killed , if you like . It 's no business of mine . " I was 171/2 , in other words , before I was allowed to go to the theater , the movies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . T REMEMBER vividly the last time Uncle Aleksandr A Svanidze came to the apartment at the Kremlin . He looked sad and depressed . He must have known too well what was going on . People were being arrested in Georgia where Beria got his start . He sat in my room a long time waiting for my father . He kissed me and played with me and let me sit on his lap . My father arrived . He generally brought the people who had been in the office with him all day . He almost never came . alone . It can hardly have been easy for Uncle Aleksandr to talk to him in front of the others . It was as if my father was making a point of cutting himself off from his relatives , his family and all their concerns . My mother 's death was a dreadful , crushing blow , BODYGUARD : Gen. Nikolai S. Vlasik , head of Stalin 's bodyguard , 1919 until late 1952 . Associated Prras PALLBEARER : Stalin in the place of honor at the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his friends . Beria played on my father 's bitterness and sense of loss . Once he was First Secretary in Georgia , it did n't take Beria long to reach Moscow , where he began his long reign in 1938 . From then on he saw my father every day . His influence on my father grew and grew and never ceased until the day of my father 's death . I speak advisedly of his influence on my father and not the other way around . Beria was more treacherous , more practiced in perfidy and cunning , more insolent and single-minded than my father . He was a stronger character . My father had his weaker sides . He was capable of self-doubt . He was cruder and more direct than Beria , and not so suspicious . He was simpler and could be led up the garden path by someone of Beria 's craftiness . Beria was aware of my father 's weaknesses . He flattered my father with a shamelessness that was nothing if not Oriental . HOW my mother hated and feared him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife Maria , his sister Mariko , who was Yenukidze 's secretary , to say nothing of Yenukidze himself , who were the first to fall . I have said already that in a good many things Beria and my father were guilty together . I am not trying to shift the blame from one to the other . The spell cast by this terrifying evil genius on my father was extremely powerful and it never failed to work . Olga Shatunovskaya has told me that Beria 's role in the Civil War in the Caucasus was highly ambiguous . He was a born spy and provocateur . He worked first for the Dashnaks ( the Armenian nationalists ) and then for the Reds as power swung back and forth . Once the Reds caught him in the act of treason and had him arrested . He was in prison awaiting sentence when a telegram arrived from Kirov , who was chief of all operations in the Caucasus , demanding that he be shot as a traitor . Just then , the fighting started up again and nobody got around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Caucasus knew of the telegram 's existence  --  and Beria himself knew of it . Is n't it perhaps here that one should seek an explanation of Kirov 's murder many years later ? It was right after Kirov 's murder in 1934 , after all , that Beria began to climb to prominence and power . Sergei Kirov was a great friend of the family ' from way back , probably from their early days in the . Caucasus . He knew the Alliluyevs exceedingly well and was very fond of my mother . Kirov used to live in our house . My father liked him and was attached to him . Kirov spent his last summer , 1934 , with us as in previous years . Then , in December , Nikolayev shot him . Would n't it be more logical to link his killing with the name of Beria rather than with that of my father ? I 'll never believe my father was involved in this particular death . Sergo Ordzhonikidze , another of our old friends , died in 1937 . I suspect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinations . In February , 1937 , he shot himself . For a long time his death was attributed to medical sabotage . Could my mother have halted the terrible process had she lived ? I doubt it . She never would have been a match for Beria .
