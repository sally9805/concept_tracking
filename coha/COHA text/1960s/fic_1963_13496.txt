DECEMBER 31 st.Morning . Before the curtain rises , Ahlie 's voice , accompanied by the strumming of his guitar , is heard singing the first verse of his song . When I walk up and down with the boys today And hear the banjos play , Thinking of her I begin a- scheming , Of other days we 'll be dreaming , Behind a yellow door , Behind a yellow door . The curtain rises towards the end of the verse . It shows Ahlie in the living room , singing his song to Sena . She stands ready to attend him with a cup of coffee . GAMALDIEN Now just listen to verse two , Sena ! All the boys are mad on it ! ( Strums the guitar again , looking deep into Sena 's eyes . ) When the girls run out to watch us boys go by On feet that swiftly fly , You 'll not find one on this Cape 's fair shore , Like my girl behind the yellow door ' Behind the yellow door , Behind the yellow door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hey ? DANIELS I think it 's very nice , Ahlie . But come , drink your coffee . It 's getting icy cold . GAMALDIEN Does n't it mean something to you , hey Sena ? Who lives round here has got a yellow front door ? p. 3 DANIELS I know . But there 's lots of yellow doors . GAMALDIEN ( accepts the coffee and slurps it noisily ) Oh no Sena , my girl , not many yellow doors round here . You know jolly well the Daniels ' the only yellow door round here . Do n't you now ? ( Laughs , pulls her toward him ) . DANIELS Well .... it sounds like bragging somehow , to even think you mean ... well , to think you mean anyone real . It 's just a song . A yellow door sounds nice in a song .... GAMALDIEN Nicer than a pink one ? Or a green one ? Or purple ? Or blue ? DANIELS And then .... maybe it 's not me ... GAMALDIEN Who then , hey ? DANIELS Well , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , there 's your mother , also lives behind the yellow door ! Crikey , imagine me writing up Mrs.Daniels in a song ! DANIELS Well , THEY 'D think it was just as funny ME getting wrote up in a song ! GAMALDIEN Well ! Who 'd the Daniels family consider good enough to be wrote up in a song ? Not even the Queen of England , I bet ! p. 4 DANIELS Well , Betty now . If someone wrote up Betty in a song , they 'd take it natural like . GAMALDIEN Now , I wonder why . This is bloody good coffee . I do n't think Betty ever made a cup of coffee with those lily-white hands of hers , did she now ? DANIELS Well ... she 's very pretty for one thing . GAMALDIEN Not as pretty as you are ! DANIELS AND she 's very clever . GAMALDIEN Not as clever as you . DANIELS Aaaaach , go on man , Ahlie . You only say that . You know I finished school before I had my Standard Six . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to go by now , is it ? DANIELS I suppose not ... But THEY do ! GAMALDIEN And when you got the second lead with the Eoan Group ? And your name in big red letters on the posters ? Did n't THAT show them ? DANIELS That 's not cleverness , you see . Not as they know cleverness . GAMALDIEN Yeah ? - And how do they know cleverness , hey ? You tell me . Who do they give the top marks to ? p. 5 DANIELS Well , Davey now . He 's clever . Mr.Parker says he 's sure to get a First Class in the Matric . And perhaps a scholarship at Cape Town University if he does well enough . To learn for anything he wants ..... GAMALDIEN Yeah , I see . But that 's not what I call cleverness now . Look at Davey . A strapping young man of eighteen years old , an ' he 's never walked with the Coons . Do they think THAT 'S so grand ? DANIELS Well . The Coons , and singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just something anyone can do , they think . It takes no brains , you see ... GAMALDIEN Oh yeah ? - Tell your mother we want a nice young girl - just like her- to sing the lead in " Rio Rita " , will you ? Of course we 'll expect some pretty dancing in a naked costume as well ! DANIELS Oh , I know , Ahlie ! It 's not that I think like them too . I also get fed up sometime . " Specially as I get it all the time , you know . ( Imitating ) Betty 's so wonderful to be a teacher . Is n't it wonderful Mr.Parker says Davey may win a scholarship , is n't it wonderful to have such brains in the family , all the time , ' til sometimes I want to scream ! GAMALDIEN Hell , why do n't you ? DANIELS Well , one day I will ! Now every mealtime it is : Will Davey get that scholarship , will Davey not get that scholarship , will he , will he not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go pick daisies . DANIELS Pick daisies ? GAMALDIEN Yeah . Like " she loves me , she loves me not " . YOU know . DANIELS Oh , I see ! Well , its only three more days till the papers come out . With the results , you know . ( She starts clearing the table , and Ahlie strums a few halfhearted chords ) . GAMALDIEN ( shouting towards Sena as she moves into the kitchen ) Where 've your mother and Betty gone anyway ? I saw them coming up the street as if they meant business . DANIELS ( from the kitchen ) Betty needs new dresses for over the New Year . GAMALDIEN Oh yeah . Why ca n't she make them like you make yours , hey ? DANIELS She has n't the time . Besides she earns money , and I do n't . GAMALDIEN If it was n't for you doing the house here none of them could go out to work and study for fine degrees ! DANIELS ( returning from the kitchen ) Ye-es ... I suppose so .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll do that alteration to your suit . ( Goes to the dresser to unwrap the lilac-and-pink suit and lilac top hat ) . p. 7 GAMALDIEN ( explains with gestures ) It 's the sleeves , you see . They 're just THAT bit too long . So when I want to put my hand nicely over my heart like ( he illustrates ) , they 're just that tiny bit too long . Sort of get in the way , if you know what I mean . DANIELS ( unwraps the suit ) I see . Was it alright otherwise ? GAMALDIEN Yeah , fine , just fine . Saved me a lot of chink not going to the tailor . DANIELS That 's good ( Inspecting the garment ) now , if I do a little tuck- say about THIS big- ( shows him about half an inch ) . Inside the lining of each sleeve , it should be fine ... GAMALDIEN Okay Sena . You do as you think best . Enter DAVEY . DANIELS Morning Sena . Morning Ahlie . Sorry I slept so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewing gear . ) Any chance of getting a cup of coffee , Sena ? DANIELS Morning Davey . I put the coffee put on the stove . There 's also some bread and jam on a plate . DANIELS ( moves toward the kitchen ) Thanks . p. 8 GAMALDIEN Hey Davey . Take my cup along . I can do with some more liquid too . DANIELS ( unwilling for a moment ) Oh , alright then . ( Goes off into the kitchen ) GAMALDIEN Lucky brother you got . Can sleep till ten in the morning . DANIELS It 's not ten yet . GAMALDIEN Well , bloody near it . Must I apologize for waking him up with my singing ? DANIELS re-enters . GAMALDIEN Hey Davey ! ( Sarcastically ) I hope my singing did n't disturb your dreams ! DANIELS Why no . I did n't hear . GAMALDIEN Ha-ha . The sleep of the wicked and the lazy . Dead to the world . DANIELS Davey 's on holidays now . GAMALDIEN Yeah . So 's Betty . When do you get your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . ( Takes his coffee from Davey ) Thanks . Just let me know in good time so I can book us a suite at the Marine . We might meet my bosom pal the Prime Minister there DANIELS ( pointedly ignoring Ahlie ) Can I get you another cup too , Sena ? p. 9 DANIELS I wo n't say no to another cup , thanks Davey . GAMALDIEN Good-oh Davey ! I see my preaching done some good ! DANIELS I do n't know what you 're talking about . GAMALDIEN Seems your brain is too big to catch up on the little things ! DAVEY goes into the kitchen . DANIELS Do n't be so hard on him , Ahlie . GAMALDIEN They 're not exactly soft on you , are they , Sena ? DANIELS That 's not Davey 's fault . He 's too young to notice . GAMALDIEN At eighteen he should be grown up . Some 's I know become fathers at eighteen , get married at eighteen ... DANIELS Now , do n't you go putting ideas into Davey 's head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? GAMALDIEN No ideas . You just carry on with your nose stuck nicely in a book . Read any good love stories lately ? DANIELS I do n't read love stories . GAMALDIEN Thought not . What about a nice thrilling murder ? Something that gives you shivers up the spine ? Some Frankenstein maybe .... p. 10 DANIELS I do n't read those either . GAMALDIEN Well , for Crumb 's sake , what DO you read ? DANIELS Not the kind of stuff you 'd understand anything about . GAMALDIEN Well , you just try me . ( Points to a big book on the dresser ) You just hand me that there book , Sena , and let me have a go at it . DANIELS ( continues sewing ) Will you two please stop it . There 's nothing to be getting ratty about . DANIELS I 'M not getting ratty . GAMALDIEN ( going to the dresser ) Oh yeah ? Telling me I wo n't understand your highbrow books ? ( Picks up the volume , reads aloud ) DISEASES PECULIAR TO THE SPANIEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But catch me reading if a spaniel gets more and bigger worms than a Peke ! You find that interesting ? DANIELS Very . GAMALDIEN More interesting than about love ? Or film stars ? Or murder ? DANIELS Yes . GAMALDIEN Well , strike me pink ! ( Puts the book down , and returns to the comfortable armchair . Politely sarcastic to Davey ) Mind if I sit here ? p. 11 DANIELS Not at all . GAMALDIEN Sure I 'm not taking your chair ? DANIELS ( equally sarcastic ) Quite sure , thankyou . GAMALDIEN Well , that 's a weight off my chest . I LIKE this chair . The only comfortable one in this room . Davey , will you do me a favour , please ? DANIELS What ? GAMALDIEN Just hand me my guitar over there . You 're closer than I am . DAVEY makes no move . GAMALDIEN So you do n't want to , hey ? I do n't want to disturb Sena , see . She 's busy putting the final touches on my outfit . DAVEY gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . GAMALDIEN Do n't forget your book . Just in case someone 's hundred rand spaniel up the road gets a tummy ache from drinking too much champagne ! DANIELS ( calling after Davey ) There 's lots more coffee if you want it ! DANIELS ( from his room ) Thanks ! I 'll help myself ! GAMALDIEN I should jolly well hope so ! p. 12 DANIELS Here . I think that 's done it . You can try it on now . GAMALDIEN Thanks a million , Sena . Now that 's what a call real quick service . Sena Daniels ' Twenty-Four Minute Service . You should set up in business . MRS.RAYMOND from next door comes up the porch steps outside . DANIELS Why do n't you put the whole outfit on again ? So I can see again how it looks . GAMALDIEN So you can admire your own handiwork again ? DANIELS Well , I just like to see . RAYMOND , MRS. ( knocks ) Cooooo-eeeee ! Anybody ho-ome ? DANIELS Oh ' it 's Mrs.Raymond from next door . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mornings everybody ! ( Sees Ahlie ) Well , well , well ! If it is n't the Golden Dixie 's ' Sunshine boy in person ! GAMALDIEN ( leaps up , gives an exaggerated bow ) In pois-son ! Am I facing one of my admirers ? RAYMOND , MRS . Indeed , indeed you are ! I never had the pleasure meeting you sort of socially before ! But I know you from sight , of course ! p. 13 GAMALDIEN But then , who does n't ? RAYMOND , MRS . What I like about him so much is his char-arming modesty , as my Madam would say ! DANIELS That 's what I always say . I says to him , day after day : Now Ahlie , I says , you 're too modest . If only you 'd ' appreciate yourself a little more , you could go far in this world .... RAYMOND , MRS . Are you going to win the big money prize for the best solo singing Coon ? GAMALDIEN The Grand Prize , Mrs.Raymond , the Grand Prize . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win ! There 's no one in the Peninsula to touch him ! RAYMOND , MRS . Well , everyone here in Athlone has put their bets on you , Ahlie . Mrs.Jacobs was telling me in the Bridgetown Store this morning , her boy tells her- he 's one of the Golden Dixies- well , she tells me Ahlie made up his own words . That 's sure to impress the judges ! Her boys singing with them too . So I know some of them words . My Dolly picked them up from listening at rehearsals . ( Starts to sing ) When I walk up and down with the boys today , And hear the banjos play , Thinking of her I begin a-scheming , Of other days when we 'll be dreaming , Behind a yellow door , Behind a yellow door . That 's right , is n't it ? p. 14 GAMALDIEN Perfect ! ( Turns to Sena ) Now , if you do n't mind , I 'll try on that outfit of mine . ( Takes jacket and trousers and moves to L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? DANIELS That 's fine . RAYMOND , MRS . Your mother and Betty out ? DANIELS Yes , they 've gone to buy Betty 's dress for New Years . RAYMOND , MRS . As I know it , she 'll come home with two . One for the First . And one for the Second . DANIELS Well , she 's got to get ready with her trousseau anyway . She 's getting married the first of May , you know . RAYMOND , MRS . Yeah , heard all about it . Real smart boy . Teacher ' n all that . Father owns a big store , is a church elder . Mother plays the organ on Sundays . And you should see their house ! Real posh . with a garden , ' n fruit trees , ' n a lawn . Went round one day specially to have a look ; your Ma told me so much about it . Golden face bricks it has . Real classy , I must say . DANIELS Yes , Betty 's doing well for herself . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so pretty , and so clever . RAYMOND , MRS . You 're not at all bad yourself , you know . What 's your New Year dress like ? p. 15 DANIELS Oh , I made it . Off the shoulder , with a big skirt . In taffeta . Sort of flame red . Betty 's let me have her old stiff petty , as she 's getting a new one . Oh , SORRY Mrs.Raymond . Let me get you a cup of coffee ! RAYMOND , MRS . Do n't trouble to make it specially . DANIELS ( already moving to the kitchen ) No trouble , Mrs.Raymond . It 's all made already . ( Shouting in Ahlie 's direction ) You want a refill , Ahlie ? GAMALDIEN ( from offstage ) Yeah ! And something to eat maybe . DANIELS Right , I 'll fry you a couple of eggs ! GAMALDIEN That 's the stuff for a starving man ! RAYMOND , MRS. ( alone on stage , directing her voice toward the kitchen ) Davey gone out too ? DANIELS ( still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . I thought he was finished with exams . DANIELS Yes , but he 's still studying . RAYMOND , MRS. ( picks up Davey 's heavy volume ) I did n't know they studied about spaniels for Matric. p. 16 DANIELS ( emerging from the kitchen with a tray bearing cups of coffee and a plate of food ) They do n't . That 's just his private studying . GAMALDIEN ( enters , resplendent in pink and lilac satin ) How 's that , folks ? RAYMOND , MRS . Oh ! GAMALDIEN I see , Mrs Raymond , you also interested in spaniels . Or is it Pekes ? Not many of THEM around here , I must say ! Our dogs are mostly mixed . RAYMOND , MRS . Yeah , like we are ! GAMALDIEN Yeah , like we are . No mink collars and champagne suppers for us . No manicures at the doggy beauty salon . RAYMOND , MRS . I read about that in the " Times " the other day . Just fancy , hey , while some people go starving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppers . Or mink collars . They must be hot . RAYMOND , MRS . I heard those pure breeds are n't as healthy as mongrels . GAMALDIEN Which ones , Mrs Raymond ? People or dogs ? RAYMOND , MRS . We .. ell , both I suppose . Now look at my Madam : a real thoroughbred if ever there was one . But always sick . If she 'd been a dog you 'd think of her as one of those long thin ones . Greyhounds , or Windhounds , I do n't know , as I 'm not very well up on dogs . But most of what her husband earns goes on doctors . Not a child has she been able to carry . And there was me with eight , and Mrs Bloom on the other side expecting her eleventh ... p. 17 GAMALDIEN Well , such is life . DANIELS ( enters ) A highly original and deeply moving statement . RAYMOND , MRS . Hee-hee-heee ! You sound just like my Master , even the la-di-dah voice ! DANIELS Well , Ahlie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GAMALDIEN Thanks . RAYMOND , MRS . Have you heard too , Davey , they 're offering a big money prize for the best solo number this year . DANIELS Yes , I heard . RAYMOND , MRS . And everyone around here is backing Ahlie ! Everyone I spoke to says he 's sure to get it ! DANIELS So I heard . DANIELS Of course Ahlie will win . GAMALDIEN ( suddenly awkward ) Aaaach , I do n't know .... Anyway , I think I got a sore throat coming .... It feels all kind of funny .... RAYMOND , MRS . He 's got stage fright ! GAMALDIEN ' n remember : it 's not only Athlone in this thing ! There 's the boys from Woodstock , Mowbray , Cape Town , Grassy Park , Retreat , Windermere , The whole of the Peninsula ! And some of them bloody good . Some sing in bands at dances and posh European do's. p. 18 RAYMOND , MRS . Ach Ahlie man , do n't lose heart . Of course you 'll win . People around here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd write those judges a letter . YOU 'D do it for us , would n't you . Davey ? Being properly educated and all that , you would , would n't you Davey ? DANIELS ( Touched by Ahlie 's sadness and loss of confidence ) Sure I would . But I 'm sure it wo n't be necessary . RAYMOND , MRS . What 'll you do with the money when you win ? Go to England ? GAMALDIEN Maybe . Or maybe Australia . RAYMOND , MRS . Those places you can go somewhere . It does n't count against a man there if you have a dark skin . DANIELS In the world of entertainment it 's probably an ADVANTAGE over there . GAMALDIEN Well , there 's not much left over here . I 've had leads in the Eoan Group , and really good press . I could go overseas and have proper lessons , and become really GOOD , ' n earn lots of money . DANIELS I should n't think lessons will be needed . What they like about the dark man over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectful ) NOW I see why your family says you are so clever . Yes Sena , this brother of yours , he really IS clever p. 19 RAYMOND , MRS . But EVERYONE knows about Davey 's cleverness . Just like EVERYONE knows you will win the Grand Prize . GAMALDIEN Well , I hope they are right about that . Now , Davey ( with newly respectful tone ) maybe you 'll give an opinion of my song . I 'll start on verse three , so as not to bore Sena here with the first two verses again . I already sung them to her earlier on . RAYMOND , MRS . Oh yes , do , DO ! GAMALDIEN Hand me my top hat and cane ! You play the guitar , Davey ? DANIELS Sorry , no . GAMALDIEN Right , I 'll carry on without the trimmings then . Here goes ! Tra la ! Meet the Golden Dixies ' Sunshine Boy ! ( Struts debonairly up and down , swinging his cane ) . Sings:If you look all around on New Year 's Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl like her so sweet ' Dearest one who lives on Second Street , Behind the yellow door , Behind the yellow door . SENA , DAVEY AND MRS . RAYMOND Hum the tune as well . Mrs Raymond , hands on hip , makes cheery marching movements without moving from one place . AHLIE , continuing to sing:When I walk , joke and sing with the boys today , My thoughts will go and stray , Wanting her , wanting her more and more , Girl of my dreams , behind the yellow door , Behind the yellow door , Behind the yellow door . ALL join in the end refrain p. 20 GAMALDIEN ( bowing and smiling ) That 's all for today , folks ! RAYMOND , MRS . Bravo ! Bravo ! DANIELS Jolly good Ahlie ! Lot of local colour and all that ! GAMALDIEN You really think it 's okay ? DANIELS Really ! RAYMOND , MRS . Gosh ! I must be off . Now what did I come here for , Sena ? DANIELS You did n't say .

I 'll be around again this evening to see the old year out with you folks . But a happy New Year to you , Ahlie . I do n't suppose I 'll be bumping into you again before the Carnival . GAMALDIEN Maybe , maybe not . But a happy New Year to you too , Mrs Raymond , Will you be along to Hartleyvale tomorrow ? p. 21 RAYMOND , MRS . You bet ! I 'll cheer for you specially ! GAMALDIEN You do that , Mrs Raymond ! See you there anyway ! RAYMOND , MRS . Fine , fine ! Bye for now ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to check out Dolly 's dog 's sore leg . I promised to put another bandage on today . RAYMOND , MRS . Sure , sure ! Dolly will be glad to see you ! BOTH exit , going down the porch steps together . DANIELS SO , Ahlie . Everyone says you 'll win that Grand Prize . GAMALDIEN You do n't look very happy for me .... DANIELS Of course I would be . GAMALDIEN All I can say is , you do n't look it . Quite the opposite in fact , if you ask me . DANIELS Do n't nag at me ! GAMALDIEN Well , I like that ! What have I done now ! ( Moves quickly to her side ) Why , Sena , it seems to me you 're crying ! DANIELS No , I 'm not ! GAMALDIEN Because I 'm going to England ? Or Australia maybe ? DANIELS You 're crazy ! You have n't even won the money ! p. 22 GAMALDIEN And if I win the money , you 'll come with me ! And if I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Married ? GAMALDIEN ( kisses her ) Be happy !

WE did n't go up to Matric ! DANIELS Okay , Ma . You did n't miss a thing . DANIELS , MRS . Seems to me since that singing idiot Ahlie was here all morning , you 've gotten very cheeky . DANIELS He only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying to me today : How nice of your sister to make Ahlie 's Carnival outfit . So I said : That 's the first I heard of it . I hope your son was satisfied with the work ? And she did n't even notice the sarcasm . DANIELS , MRS . SENA ! You made that Malay boy 's Coon costume ? DANIELS Yes , I did ! DANIELS , MRS .

And in comes some swearing singing Malay boy off the streets , and stuffs himself with our food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have time for this singing nonsense ! All this walking with the Coons ! All this disturbing the peace of decent folks . And me , going to work in all kinds of weather ... p. 31 DANIELS As if I never did any work around here ! DANIELS , MRS . And like Betty said just now , he does n't come for your sake ! Only for what he can get out of you ! Making his outfits , eating our hard earned food ! DANIELS He asked me to marry him . Several seconds of stunned silence follow this announcement . DANIELS , MRS . Why ! The nerve of it ! How does he think he 's going to support a wife , hey ? Loafing and singing in the streets ? DANIELS He 's got a perfectly good job with the builders as a painter ! They got holidays over Christmas and the New Years ! DANIELS ( sarcastic ) So the boys can rehearse themselves in for the Coons ? DANIELS You stay out of this , sister ! You 've got your man ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DANIELS , MRS . At least your sister got a decent man she can be proud of ! DANIELS Any girl around here would give ten years of her life just to have a date with Ahlie Gamaldien , never mind marry him . You just ask Mrs Raymond . Dolly 's even got an autographed photo of him up in her room . p. 32 DANIELS , MRS . Dolly 's a stupid young girl ! Still wet behind the ears ! You told him to be off packing , I trust . DANIELS No . I did not ! I have n't given him an answer yet , but I will ! I 'm sick and tired of doing all the dirty work around here , and never getting any appreciation . Who does the washing up every night ? Does anybody ever offer to help ? No ! So I can never be in time for a film ! And had to turn down the lead in the next opera because I can never be in time for rehearsals ! That broke my heart that did . DANIELS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mind ? DANIELS No ! I come to my senses at last ! Nobody ever lifts a finger around here because Sena-stupid Sena who only has a Standard Six-because stupid good-for-nothing-else Sena is there to do it all ! Well , I might as well do all this where I WILL be appreciated ! AND get a little love and praise in return ! DANIELS That 's a stupid reason for getting married . DANIELS No more stupid than your reason . DANIELS What do you mean ? DANIELS You 're only marrying George because you think he 's posh and his parents have a grand house . At least I 'm in love with Ahlie . Do you hear that folks : I LOVE AHLIE ! YOU HEAR ME ! I LOVE HIM ! You listen good , I love Ahlie Gamaldien ! p. 33 DANIELS , MRS . Love ! That 's a fine joke . And where will you be when he takes a whole lot of other wives like all them Malay boys do ! DANIELS Please ... I .... I .... DANIELS , MRS. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Besides , How ' we going to manage when Davey goes up to Varsity ? I wo n't be able to take on extra jobs if I have to do the house . SENA walks quickly out of the living room onto the porch . She leans with her back against the door , eyes closed . DAVEY , BETTY and MRS DANIELS remain sitting inside , in silence , not eating . LOVERS , a very young boy and girl in party dress , pass slowly across the stage : very intimately , not speaking . Somewhere backstage a guitar is heard playing again until the end of the scene . DANIELS ( after a while ) Where do you think she 's gone ? ( No answer ) . DANIELS Has she gone to Ahlie , do you think ? Not to come back again DANIELS ( enters ) When you folks have finished your supper , just give me a call . So I know when to do the washing up . CURTAIN A solitary minstrel in his pink-and-lilac uniform moves slowly across the front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 34 Act 1 , Scene 3 31st DECEMBER : About half an hour before midnight . Both the living room and porch lights in the Daniels ' home are burning . The front door is standing wide open . Paper chains and streamers decorate the living room . The best white cloth has been laid on the table . DANIELS , MRS. ( dressed in spotted silk , adds final touches to the table decoration ) how 's that look ? Alright ? DANIELS ( in her bright red off the shoulder dress , is taking glasses out of the dresser , and arranges them on the table ) Looks fine to me . You want me to cut the watermelon tonight , or leave it until tomorrow ? DANIELS , MRS . It 's alright , Sena . I 'll do it . DANIELS It 's okay , Ma . I can get on with it quickly before the Raymonds come . DANIELS , MRS . Sena ..... DANIELS Yes Ma ? DANIELS , MRS . I .. I 'm sorry about just now , at supper time ... I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mean it , like you think . DANIELS It 's alright , Ma . Let 's not talk about it any more . DANIELS , MRS . I know it 's a lot to do sometimes . But , when one has clever children in the family , one must do everything to give them a chance . You do see , do n't you ? p. 35 DANIELS Yes , Ma . I do see . DANIELS , MRS . Now look at Betty : It was a real struggle to get her through Teacher 's College . Even WITH the help of that loan . But now she 's finished , and she 's earning lots more than if she 'd gone into service . Or worked in a factory , even . And she gives toward expenses . Now look at our radiogram . We 'd never have that but for Betty 's good salary . AND a fridge . AND the electric hot plates so we do n't have to light the stove for every cup of coffee . Especially in the early mornings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? DANIELS That 's true .... DANIELS , MRS . I know it 's hard . Not earning . Not having the money to go to a film , or something . Wait ! ( Hurries through the door ) . SENA continues arranging glasses , re-arranging them , polishing with a cloth , holding them against the light . DANIELS , MRS. ( enters quickly , holding her handbag ) Look , Sena . I made up my mind . ( Opens the bag , fumbling through its contents ) Here ! Here is some pocket money for you . DANIELS Oh Ma ! Really ! DANIELS , MRS . Go on , Sena ! Take it ! I 've quite made up my mind : every end of the month , you get your allowance , regular like , whatever happens ! An ' if I have n't got too many expenses that month , or had a windfall or something , there will be a bit extra . So you wo n't have to be asking every time ... p. 36 DANIELS But really , Ma ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a bad month , extra expenses ? DANIELS , MRS . No , Sena , I 've quite made up my mind . My New Year resolution , you could sort of say . The RAYMONDS , MR and MRS and DOLLY come onto the stage . MRS RAYMOND is dressed in bright purple , DOLLY in white with red , ballerina type shoes , MR RAYMOND in white shirt with tie . MRS RAYMOND is carrying a bulging shopping bag , MR RAYMOND a large watermelon , and DOLLY a big bunch of flowers . They seem happy and jolly , making their way up the porch steps . DANIELS ( puts several notes of money in her apron pocket , after having looked at it disbelievingly for a few moments ) Ma ... I really do n't know what to say .... DANIELS , MRS . Well , do n't say anything then ! DANIELS Thankyou , Ma ! ( Reaches for her mother 's hand ) I 'm sorry about what I said at suppertime.well . Some of the things ... DANIELS , MRS . Ach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst in , MRS RAYMOND heading the trio . RAYMOND , MRS . Happy New Year ! Happy New Year to all of you'se ! p. 37 DANIELS , MRS. ( aside ) Take your apron off , Sena . Good evening Mrs Raymond , Mr Raymond , Dolly . Happy New Year to all of you ! RAYMOND , MRS . We brought a few little things along . ( Puts the bag on the table , begins to unpack : paper hats , crackers , bottles of wine , cakes ) Go on , Dolly ! You give them flowers to Mrs Daniels . RAYMOND , MR . Where can I put the watermelon , hey ? No New Year without a watermelon ! DANIELS , MRS . Indeed not ! I 've never seen a New Year in without a watermelon ! RAYMOND , MR . I even gave my horses some today ! ALL laugh . DANIELS Come this way to the kitchen , Mr Raymond . We 'll cut it up in here to eat after " Auld Lang Syne " . RAYMOND , MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAYMOND move toward the kitchen . DANIELS , MRS . Just a moment , Sena ! Take the flowers along and put them in a vase . DANIELS Okay Ma . My ! Are n't they lovely and fresh ! RAYMOND , MR . Yeah . Planted them myself . DANIELS , MRS . My , my , is n't it nice to have a man around the house , as the saying goes . p. 38 RAYMOND , MRS . Pretty useful sometimes , I must admit . SENA and MR RAYMOND go off , into the kitchen . DOLLY Where 's Davey then , Mrs Daniels ? DANIELS , MRS . Just a sec. and I 'll call him . Oh , Mrs Raymond , what grand paper hats ! DOLLY Do n't bother , thanks , I 'll go in myself . DANIELS , MRS . Oh no , Dolly ! I do n't approve of young girls going into boy ' rooms . Or the other way round . DOLLY Oh Mrs Daniels ! RAYMOND , MRS . Aaaach , Mrs Daniels , let them be ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MRS. ( doubtfully ) I do n't know ... RAYMOND , MRS . Well , even if they could , they would hardly with all of us around . What 's more , with Davey being a well brought up boy , what 's to worry ? DANIELS , MRS . Oh , alright then It 's that door over there . DOLLY ( impishly ) Yeah , I know ! ( Exits ) RAYMOND , MRS . Davey studying ? DANIELS , MRS . Yeah Big books on animals . p. 39 RAYMOND , MRS . Funny thing . I always thought once you finished exams , you finished studying . Swotting up , is what Dolly calls it . DANIELS , MRS . Ah well , you know Davey . Can never keep his nose out of the books . Wants to become a vet . That 's why all of them books on horses ' n dogs ' things . RAYMOND , MRS . My husband takes him to the stables sometimes . Says Davey 's simply marvellous with the horses . Can make them do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DANIELS , MRS . Yeah , he 's like that with our dumb friends , as we call them animals . Had to put my foot down when that last cat died . He gets so upset , spends all his time with them when they get poorly . And then , they 're always the poorly one he brings home , of course . RAYMOND , MRS . You have no pets now , Dolly tells me . Davey 's pretty cut up about it , she tells me . Always coming over to tend Dolly 's dog . Specially now it 's got a sore and festering leg in a fight . DANIELS , MRS . Well , I had to make that rule : no more pets till exams are over . After , we can get a dog . A healthy one , this time . Even if we have to pay for it . I do n't want another maimed sick smelly thing off the streets again . RAYMOND , MRS . He likes dogs . He can have one of Dolly 's dog 's puppies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Dolly ... p. 40 DANIELS , MRS . Oh no no no ! He 's not interested in girls , is our Davey . And I always say , there 's plenty of time for that still . You ' still young . You ' still got a lifetime ahead of you . RAYMOND , MRS . True , too true . It 's different for a boy . How 's Betty getting on with her George ? DANIELS , MRS . Fine , just fine . A real good solid boy that George . He 's coming here to see the New Year in with us later on . Out to a film they went together , Betty looking real smart in her new blue dress . RAYMOND , MRS . Made a turn past his peoples ' house the other day . Just happened to be going that way . Real posh . DANIELS , MRS . Yes , he comes from a very good family . His father owns Isaacson 's Cash Store . Is a church elder too . His wife plays the organ , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many round here take pianoforte lessons . But it goes to show what a smart , cultured woman she is . Used to be teacher too till she married rich Albert Isaacson . RAYMOND , MRS . So they say . Now have a sip of this here wine I got from Mr Ockert at the Athlone Bottle Store . Got a special deal : really cheap . DANIELS , MRS . Hmmm . Very good . Would n't have known it was a cheap wine . p. 41 RAYMOND , MRS. ( pours herself a generous helping ) I think it 's pretty good . Had some before we came over . But then , I carry my drink well . Any New Year 's resolutions ? DANIELS , MRS . Only one . RAYMOND , MRS . I got a whole list worked out . Only hope I remember them all when midnight strikes DANIELS , MRS . I 'll remember mine , that 's for sure . It 's about Sena , you see .... SENA and MR RAYMOND enter from the kitchen . DANIELS What about me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . I see you 've been cutting up the watermelon . RAYMOND , MR. ( puts down the tray with slices of watermelon ) We 've been working very hard , Sena and I. We deserve a little drink too . What about passing us a snort , hey ? DANIELS , MRS . But of course ! ( Starts pouring ) RAYMOND , MRS . Like you did n't have a good helping before you came over ! RAYMOND , MR . So did you , Chrissie ! So did you ! RAYMOND , MRS . Sure , sure . I do n't mind . I was only saying ! p. 42 DANIELS I put some stuff on Mr Raymond 's boils for him . RAYMOND , MRS . Oh no ! You never ! You did n't show your boils to Sena ! In the kitchen of all places ! RAYMOND , MR . I would n't dream of such a thing ! It was in the pantry I showed her ! DAVEY and DOLLY enter . RAYMOND , MRS . And you had the nerve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alright Mrs Raymond , I offered . RAYMOND , MR . Besides , I ca n't reach them there myself , can I now ? DOLLY ( giggling , aside to Davey ) If you knew where Pa 's boils are ! RAYMOND , MR . I was saying to Sena : Got them from a horse I was working with , most likely . Had a great big sore place to wash .... DANIELS Doubles ' sore place not better yet ? RAYMOND , MR . No . ' N I been doing all you said .... DANIELS Well then , I 'll tell you what to do now . Go up to Outpatients at Groote Schuur Hospital after the holidays . They 'll give you something for your boils . Lots more than you need for yourself . So , you give the horse some on his sore too . It 's the same germ , you see , if you got it from him . p. 43 RAYMOND , MR . My , but you are the clever one ! I 'd never have thought up a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get them ever so often . That way you get a good supply . RAYMOND , MR . Right-oh , Davey . I 'll do just that . DOLLY Seems to me you 're so clever already you do n't need to go to any University . DANIELS Oh , I 'll have to study properly to become a proper vet . DOLLY A vet ? What 's a vet ? DANIELS Gosh Dolly ! I told you before . Short for veterinary surgeon . Animal doctor to you . RAYMOND , MRS . Come on , folks ! Let 's put some life into this here party ! Let 's have some music ! DOLLY Yes , Ma ! Let 's ! So Davey and I can do some dancing . MRS RAYMOND turns on some music to full volume . RAYMOND , MRS . Come on , folks ! Here 's your caps ! Come , Mrs Daniels ! An orange one to brighten up that drab dress of yours !

That 's a good one ! Come on Mrs Daniels , put on your orange ! RAYMOND , MR . Yeah , come on , Mrs Daniels ! The King of Athlone orders . DANIELS Look at your Dad in royal purple ! RAYMOND , MR . Yeah , remind me to put some money on that horse , Must be an omen . Me in Royal Purple ! DANIELS , MRS . Does n't it look rather silly for us grown ups to be in silly paper hats ? RAYMOND , MRS . That 's better , Mrs Daniels ! Hubby , just look at Mrs Daniels ! RAYMOND , MR . You look BEE-OOTI-FUL Mrs Daniels ! Shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure we do n't look too silly ? I mean , Betty is bringing her George .... DOLLY Honestly , Mrs Daniels . You look lovely ! RAYMOND , MRS . You should have seen those posh Europeans last year on Old Years Eve . Madam had a party , so I got back late . So , passing the Cecil hotel , I saw them pile out like a long queue . Holding each other sort of by the waist . Walking so silly like , like ducks- probably had buckets to drink-shouting and ya-hooing . Walking right through the gardens , them ladies in their naked dresses , all wearing these paper hats . p. 45 DANIELS , MRS. ( fascinated as always by the doings of " grand people " ) Honest , Mrs Raymond ? Right into the garden , where the public could see ? One behind the other , you say ? RAYMOND , MRS .

MRS DANIELS dances stiffly , MR RAYMOND full of gay abandon . RAYMOND , MRS. ( dancing all by herself , holding a bottle of wine ) Hey kids , you want some drink ? Come on , join the fun ! BETTY and GEORGE come slowly onto the pavement R. DOLLY No thanks , Ma , we 're working on our steps . p. 46 DANIELS No thanks Mrs Raymond . I do n't like the stuff . BETTY and GEORGE have reached the porch , are standing outside the door . GEORGE takes a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why are you hanging back like that ? ISAACSON Well ... actually ... I think my people will want me to see the New Year in with them . DANIELS But George , you SAID you were coming ! You promised ! ISAACSON I 've thought it over . I 'll have to hurry to get to my folks on time ! DANIELS But George ! I told my Mom already ! She 'll be upset if you do n't ! ISAACSON Well , tell her I 'm sorry ! DANIELS She 's been taking special trouble for you . I thought you wanted us to see the New Year in together . ISAACSON Well , I changed my mind . My folks will appreciate me being with them . Bye for now ! DANIELS What 's the matter , George ? Do n't you like me anymore ? ISAACSON Let 's not shout out our feelings for all to hear ! So , let 's stop the dramatics ! DANIELS So you HAVE changed your feelings about me ! p. 47 ISAACSON Do n't be silly ! Of course I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise , that 's all . Goodnight ! ( Walks away ) DANIELS PLEASE George ! ISAACSON ( turns around ) Yes Betty ? DANIELS I ... I just wanted to wish you a Happy New Year ... ISAACSON Thanks . Same to you . So ... well , I 'll be off then . Goodbye ! DANIELS ( slowly goes up porch steps , then remains standing in the open doorway ) . DANIELS Hello Betty , had a nice time ? BETTY does not answer . RAYMOND , MRS . Hyah Betty ! Happy New Year ! Have some wine ! MRS DANIELS has loosened up in her dancing , and has not noticed Betty 's return . BETTY goes to switch the music off . MRS DANIELS and MR RAYMOND stop dancing . RAYMOND , MRS . What on earth ! Has the gram gone out of order ... ? Why , Betty ! You 're back ! RAYMOND , MR. ( raising his purple cap ) Happy New Year 's , Betty ! DANIELS , MRS . But where 's George ? p. 48 DANIELS You dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaving like drunken hooligans ! Are you SURPRISED he did n't want to come ? We could n't hear each other speak with the racket going on ! DANIELS , MRS . Sorry Betty . Really , I 'm sorry . I did n't know he 'd take it like that .... After all , it IS Old Year 's Eve . And everybody wanted some music ... DANIELS He 's probably finished with me now ! And I do n't blame him ! Coming from such a family of noisy hooligans ! DANIELS , MRS . If he loves you , Betty , that wo n't make any difference . Honestly ... DANIELS He would n't even kiss me a Happy New Year ! If you spoilt it all for me , I 'll never forgive you ! Never ! Never , never , never ! AHLIE and some of his troupe in full regalia come whooping across the stage . AHLIE leaps onto the porch . GAMALDIEN This way , boys !

( To the Dixies ) Come on boys ; let 's have some singing to cheer up some dreary people ! p. 50 DIXIES What must we sing ? GAMALDIEN ( to Mrs Raymond , Davey and Mrs Daniels ) You know the tune of " Hoe sag gly ons bootjie " ? RAYMOND , MRS . Sure we know that one ! Who does n't ? DOLLY Of course we do !

This time his embrace is soft and tender . ) DANIELS ( relaxes into his arms , clinging for comfort ) .

MRS DANIELS , SENA and BETTY , dressed in discreet conservative style , are seen to lay the table in the living room , with a white tablecloth , a vase with tall flowers , and a large cake . DANIELS , MRS. ( walks purposefully onto the porch , shouts : Stop that racket , you ! ) BOYS AND GIRLS pay no attention ; continue singing , dancing , strumming , laughing loudly . DANIELS , MRS . Hey-you ! If you do n't stop that row I 'll send someone to fetch the police ! You hear ! The POLICE ! BOYS and GIRLS , stop slowly . GIRL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ! DANIELS , MRS .

You bought enough to feed the army ! DANIELS Well , in case Mr Parker felt hungry . I mean , we do n't want to look like we are skimping him ! After all the trouble he 's taken . DANIELS I should think he 's proud of you . Third highest Matric results in the whole of the Cape , including the posh European schools . A real scoop for his school , I would say ! p. 57 DANIELS Well , he DID say he was proud of me . That it was an honour for the school . That there would be no trouble about a scholarship . So , there 's no need to be scared . DANIELS , MRS . Of course not ! Still ... DANIELS Still what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the feeling one has ... Some things seem too good to be true ... Suppose ... supposing they find out you 're Coloured ? DANIELS I TOLD you , Ma ! It does n't matter ! Other boys from our school got scholarships to Cape Town University before ! They do n't mind THERE , do n't you see , Ma ? DANIELS , MRS . I know .... But at the back of one 's mind , there 's always that feeling ... DANIELS PLEASE Ma , do n't worry about it any more ! Think of the times I 'll earn big money setting up as a vet ! DANIELS You think people round here will bring their animals to a vet ? DANIELS Of course they will ! They only let them die in their backyards because there 's nowhere round here to go . Our people love animals , they really do , DANIELS Sure , they do . But can they afford big money to cure them ? p. 58 DANIELS Those that ca n't afford to pay , I 'll treat for free ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their sick pets . DANIELS , MRS . I know ... I know ... But still I worry . For our people things just seem to go wrong so many times .... DANIELS Please do n't WORRY , Ma ! I 'll buy us a plot of land , and build us a real posh place , with a surgery at the side , and a place to make a hospital for sick animals . Maybe in the country somewhere , where farmers can use a vet . And you 'll keep chickens , like you always wanted to . And a lawn , and fruit trees . Apricots , and peaches , and plums . And you 'll bottle as many as you want , and make that special peach chutney .... DANIELS , MRS . Oh Davey , Davey , it 's all a lovely dream , but not for the likes of us . MR PARKER enters . Checks the house number , slowly mounts the porch steps , and knocks . DANIELS , MRS . Gosh ! Can that be him already ! DANIELS Crumbs ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ten , it seems to me . I 'll open up . ( Goes to the door ) PARKER , MR . Good afternoon ! Does the Daniels family live here ? p. 59 DANIELS Good afternoon ! Yes , yes we live here . PARKER , MR . I believe I am expected . DANIELS Yes , yes , of course ! You must be Mr Parker . Come on inside then ! PARKER , MR . Thankyou ! DANIELS , MRS . Good afternoon , Mr Parker . We feel so happy you could come . And honoured , of course ! We could have come to see you ... PARKER , MR . Good afternoon . You 're Davey 's mother ? You must forgive me if I do n't remember everybody , but so many parents come to see me from time to time . DANIELS , MRS. ( apologetic ) Well , actually , I never did . There never seemed any cause to ... Davey was giving no trouble .... I would n't have wished to waste your time . PARKER , MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs Daniels . You must be very proud of Davey . We never had anyone from our school come that high in the exams before . ( Towards Davey ) Good afternoon , my boy . Some of the excitement simmered down now ? DANIELS ( shy ) Yes , Mr Parker . Good afternoon , Mr Parker . DANIELS , MRS . Sit down , please , Mr Parker . p. 60 PARKER , MR . Thankyou . DANIELS ( softly , hoping that only her mother would hear ) The coffee , Ma ? DANIELS , MRS . Oh dear , oh dear ! PARKER , MR . Anything the matter , Mrs Daniels ? I mean , if it is inconvenient to offer anything .... DANIELS , MRS . Oh no , no , no ! Of course not ! PARKER , MR . Then , I must say , that coffee smells really good ! DANIELS , MRS . Oh yes , Mr Parker ! You 're not in any immediate hurry for it , are you ? PARKER , MR . No-oh , of course not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempting ! DANIELS , MRS . Davey , maybe you could ... Oh no . You 'd better stay . We might want you for the discussions .... Sena , maybe you could go and check on Betty .... BETTY comes rushing up the porch steps , bearing a huge china coffee pot , and flings open the door : DANIELS Just made it , Ma ! Another three minutes to go ! ( Sees Mr Parker ) OH ! PARKER , MR . Why , hello ! If it is n't Betty Daniels ! One of our bright former pupils ! I should have guessed you and Davey were brother and sister ! p. 61 DANIELS ( trying to hide the coffee pot ) Good afternoon Mr Parker ! PARKER , MR . You 're teaching now , I 've been told . At the Athlone Primary , I hear . DANIELS ( moves the coffee pot behind her back ) That 's right , Mr Parker . PARKER , MR . I hear you have a real knack with the little ones . DANIELS ( sidles toward the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear , Mr Parker .... PARKER , MR . Why do n't you come to sit down as well ? DANIELS in a moment , Mr Parker . ( Still sidling toward Sena. who moves behind her sister , and smoothly transfers the coffee pot ) DANIELS I 'll go get the coffee now ! DANIELS , MRS . Coffee wo n't be a minute now ! PARKER , MR . That will be very nice , Mrs Daniels . DANIELS , MRS. ( hands him a small plate and a paper serviette ) But DO help yourself to some cake . Would you like me to cut a slice from my home baked one ? PARKER , MR . Thankyou , Mrs Daniels , But I never eat cake . Does n't agree with me. p. 62 DANIELS , MRS. ( disappointed ) Oh .... PARKER , MR . Really , Mrs Daniels , You should n't have gone to all that trouble ! SENA enters with the coffee , Betty smiling broadly beside her . PARKER , MR. ( holds his cup to be filled ) Ah ! Worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like it . PARKER , MR . Strong as a lion , black as night and sweet as love . Now , who always used to say that , Davey ? DANIELS Was it General Smuts , Mr Parker ? PARKER , MR . Yes Davey , I believe you 're right . I believe you are right . SENA and BETTY sit down as well . EVERYBODY is too excited to eat . PARKER , MR . Come on , Davey . Eat some of those square things there . They look like just the sort of thing I used to devour at your age . What are they called again ? DANIELS Custard slices , Mr Parker . No thankyou Mr Parker , I wo n't have any just now . PARKER , MR. ( makes an attempt at humour ) Waiting till I 'm gone ? So you can dig into the whole lot , hm ? ALL laugh dutifully . AHLIE comes sauntering across the stage , hands in his pockets , humming to himself . p. 63 PARKER , MR . Now , Davey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? PARKER , MR . Now , I 've been in contact with the University here , spoken to everyone important . DANIELS Yes , Mr Parker ? PARKER , MR . But I 'm afraid you must brace yourself for a slight disappointment ... DANIELS , MRS . It 's because he 's Coloured ! I knew it , I knew it all along ! I could feel it coming ! PARKER , MR . No , Mrs Daniels ! Calm yourself ! And please let me finish ! DANIELS Is. is there no scholarship ? The day before yesterday .. you said ... you said ... AHLIE knocks loudly at the door . DANIELS , MRS . Oh dear ! Oh dear ! I specially asked Mrs Raymond not to come by this afternoon ! ( Opens the door ) GAMALDIEN Hi Mrs Daniels ! DANIELS , MRS . Oh , it 's you ! I 'm sorry , but you ca n't come in . We 've got a visitor . GAMALDIEN Okay , okay ! Do n't go all apoplectic ! I 'll come back later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Parker . Just one of those skolly types we have to put up with in this here neighbourhood . p. 64 PARKER , MR . As I was saying : unfortunately Davey will have to prepare himself for a small disappointment . Mind you , only a small one . And maybe for the best in the long run . The scholarship is fine , there is nothing to worry about . DANIELS Then what 's the small disappointment ? PARKER , MR . It 's the course of study , you see . DANIELS , MRS . I do n't understand . What course ? What does it mean ? PARKER , MR . Davey explained to me the day before yesterday he wants to become a veterinary surgeon . DANIELS That 's right , Mr Parker . DANIELS , MRS . It 's what he always wanted to be , Mr Parker , ever since he wanted to be anything . PARKER , MR . Unfortunately the University of Cape Town does not offer such a course . DANIELS But where then , Mr Parker ? There must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Work a year first , and then go there ! Perhaps we can get the scholarship transferred ... PARKER , MR . Yes , Davey , I 've been into that . Unfortunately , the proper facilities are at Onderstepoort .... DANIELS Then I 'll go to Onderstepoort , wherever that may be ! Where is Onderstepoort , Mr Parker ? p. 65 PARKER , MR . Near Pretoria . But Davey , the University there is for Whites only ... DANIELS ( stiffly ) Oh , I see . PARKER , MR . I 'm sorry , Davey . DANIELS So a coloured man , or a black man , ca n't become a vet in this country ? PARKER , MR . I 'm afraid so , Davey . DANIELS ( bitterly ) So if he really loves animals he can be a worker in the municipal stable , like Mr Raymond next door . Shovel up horse shit , that 's all his good for . DANIELS , MRS . Davey ! You must n't talk like that . The Lord will punish you ! DANIELS The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ! PARKER , MR . Look Davey , why do n't you become an ordinary doctor ? Treat people . Several of our boys have done Medicine , are even practising as doctors already . DANIELS But it 's the animals I wanted to treat ! PARKER , MR . But your people need you too . Perhaps more so than animals . They are more aware- with their minds- of what they suffer . DANIELS But it 's the animals I really care about . They ca n't speak up for themselves , ca n't tell you what they suffer ! They are so helpless . p. 66 PARKER , MR . I can understand you 're feeling disappointed . But think about what I said . And , I 'd better be going now . Let me know by tomorrow morning . We lost a lot of time already with this little hitch . I went to a lot of trouble to find alternatives . DANIELS I know Mr Parker , Thankyou , Mr Parker . PARKER , MR . Till tomorrow then , Davey . Either phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DANIELS Yes , Mr Parker . Goodbye , Mr Parker . PARKER , MR . Goodbye , Davey . And remember , you got a great brain . Your people- and that means people like me and your mother here- need you too . When the Lord has given you a good brain , you have a certain responsibility . DANIELS Yes , Mr Parker . DANIELS , MRS . Goodbye , Mr Parker . And thankyou for all the trouble you have taken . PARKER , MR . Do n't mention it , Mrs Daniels . I did it with pleasure . DANIELS Goodbye , Mr Parker . DANIELS Goodbye , Mr Parker . PARKER , MR . Goodbye . ( Leaves quietly ) ALL return to the tea table with its uneaten cakes . p. 67 DANIELS ( automatically ) Anyone for more coffee ? DANIELS , MRS . Yes , for me please . DANIELS Me too , please . DANIELS You Davey ? DANIELS No thanks , Sena . DANIELS , MRS . So you 're going to be a real doctor instead , a people doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . But you must make up your mind , Davey ! You heard what Mr Parker said . DANIELS Well , give me time , Ma ! I got to get used to the idea I ca n't be a vet ! You do n't seem to understand how much I wanted to be a vet ! It 's all I ever wanted to be ! DANIELS , MRS . Yes , yes I know that . And of course I feel sorry for your sake . But now you have to decide on something else . DANIELS Oh Ma ! DANIELS , MRS . To be honest , I 'm quite glad about this . I never fancied my son for an animal doctor that much . A real doctor is ever so much nicer . DANIELS Oh MA ! PLEASE shut up ! DANIELS , MRS . DAVEY ! How DARE you speak to your mother like this ! p. 68 DANIELS Ach please man , Ma . Please leave Davey alone . You can see how he 's upset . DANIELS , MRS . Well , naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sena 's right . Just leave him alone . AHLIE appears again , purposefully mounts the steps , and knocks very loudly , and very long . DANIELS ( opens the door ) Oh ! Ahlie ! GAMALDIEN Yeah , it 's me . And this time I want an explanation ! DANIELS Do n't you ask ME for an explanation ! PLEASE ! GAMALDIEN Well , I mean to have it out with you . And do n't tell me again you have a visitor . I saw Mr Parker leave . DANIELS Please , Ahlie , go away . We got important family matters to discuss . GAMALDIEN Not any more important than what I need to discuss with you ! DANIELS I got nothing to discuss with you , Ahlie Gamaldien . GAMALDIEN Ca n't understand it . Never behaved like this before .... DANIELS Perhaps I understand . GAMALDIEN Oh so ? That 's very smart of you . Perhaps you care to explain to stupid old Ahlie as well ? p. 69 DANIELS I do n't think there 's any need to . GAMALDIEN Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Years Eve ? DANIELS , MRS . I do n't see what the two of you are beating around the bush about . We got serious family matters ! GAMALDIEN I came along to ask Sena to celebrate with us Golden Dixies tonight . But maybe YOU " LL come along instead , hey Betty ? DANIELS I would n't dream of such a thing ! GAMALDIEN What 's wrong with this family anyway ? Somebody die , or something ? I thought I 'd walk into happiness and celebrations , what with Mr Parker just having been ! DANIELS That 's what we all thought . Betty got us all tickets for the film at the Avalon tonight . You 'd better take those tickets round to the Raymonds to use , Betty . GAMALDIEN ( helps himself to a custard slice ) What 's up , Davey-boy ? Something gone wrong with the scholarship ? DANIELS No , the SCHOLARSHIP 'S alright ! GAMALDIEN Well , what then ? GAMALDIEN I ca n't be a vet . GAMALDIEN Ah well . Bad luck . What ' you going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . You see , Ahlie , I thought at Cape Town University you could learn for ANYTHING ! Absolutely anything ! GAMALDIEN Well , so did I. I guess most folks think that way . So where DO chaps go if they want to become doggie doctors , hey ? DANIELS Onderstepoort . A place near Pretoria . But they only take Whites . One of those Afrikaans Apartheid places , I suppose . GAMALDIEN Funny business . Seeing as most of us brown people ARE Afrikaners .... DANIELS , MRS . It 's just not right ! If a man 's got a brain , and a special gift , he should be allowed to go anywhere ! It 's the exam results that should count , only the exam results ! But I saw it coming ! I saw it coming all along ! DANIELS Oh shut UP , Ma ! GAMALDIEN Look , Davey old boy , why do n't you come and drown your sorrows with us Golden Dixies tonight ? We 're in the finals for the Grand Prize ! DANIELS ( defiant ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You 'll do no such thing ! You know they 're a bad lot ! That Jacobs boy just out of reformatory ! GAMALDIEN A reformed character , Mrs Daniels , ha-ha ! p. 71 DANIELS You 're not to go , Davey ! DANIELS , MRS . Getting mixed up with a lot of skollies ! I wo n't have it ! DANIELS Come on , Ahlie ! I need to get away from all this heavy stuff ! GAMALDIEN Fine ! Let 's go ! DANIELS ( enters ) Ahlie .... GAMALDIEN Yeah , Sena ? DANIELS Ahlie , please , I beg of you . Do n't take Davey along . GAMALDIEN And why not , may I ask ? DANIELS Come ON , Ahlie ! Take no notice ! DANIELS I ... I do n't want Davey to get mixed up with that low lot ... GAMALDIEN Low lot ? That 's what you think of us ? That 's what you think of me ? That 's why you would n't see me , would n't speak to me since New Year 's ? DANIELS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . ( To Ahlie ) If you got any feelings for me , Ahlie , please do n't take my brother along . He 's hurting right now , and bitter . GAMALDIEN Yeah ? Well , so I am . Hurting ' n bitter . p. 72 DANIELS ( lovingly , seductively ) Rather you stay here , Ahlie . You spend the evening here , Ahlie . We still got all them cakes we bought for Mr Parker . And my Mom , she 'll be glad to have you here tonight . You will , wo n't you , Ma ? DANIELS , MRS . I ... I ... Well , yes Ahlie . We invite you for this evening ... GAMALDIEN Well , blow me down with a feather ! I finally get a formal invite from Madam Daniels ! But I ca n't accept ! The boys are expecting me . It 's supposed to be a victory celebration . Sorry Sena . I wanted to invite you , ask you to be there . DANIELS Please stay Ahlie ! Please , please stay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your face ! You walk and laugh with us boys tonight ! AHLIE and DAVEY leave , locked in comradely embrace.CURTAIN. p. 73 Act 2 , Scene 2 NEXT DAY . Early morning , before sunrise . Everything is in semi darkness , except the front of the stage , which normally represents the street . DANIELS , MRS. ( enters the living room in her nightgown . Switches on the living room light . Seems dazed with sleep . Goes to the dresser where she picks up a pocket watch to look at the time . ) DANIELS , MRS . Davey ? Davey , you not home yet ? NO ANSWER . DANIELS , MRS. ( louder ) DAVEY ! DAVEY ! DANIELS ( enters in her nightdress ) What 's up , Ma ? DANIELS , MRS . It 's almost six . And Davey 's not home yet ! DANIELS ( puts her head in the doorway ) Davey ! DAVEY ! ( Turns to face her mother ) No , he 's not home yet ! DANIELS , MRS . I 'm afraid , Sena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ma . Lots of these boys stay out all night if there 's a party . DANIELS , MRS . I had a dream , you see . A terrible dream . It woke me up , you see , it seemed so real .... p. 74 DANIELS Let me get you your dressing gown , Ma . And a cup of coffee . And you 'll soon feel better . DANIELS , MRS . That dream . I ca n't get the feel of it out of my mind .... DANIELS It 's always like that with dreams , Ma . But they do n't mean a thing ! DANIELS , MRS . I ... I do n't know , Sena . I talked to lots of people had their dreams come true .... DANIELS Besides , Ma . They say a dream always means the opposite . If you dream of coffins , it means a wedding . And if you dream of a wedding , it means someone 's gon na die . DANIELS , MRS . Of course ! That 's why I had that dream about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a dream about Betty ? DANIELS , MRS . Well , about Davey , really . ( Pause ) I suppose he 'll come trooping in , wanting his breakfast . My , will I give him a piece of my mind ! DANIELS Yeah , Ma . You do that . I 'll put the coffee on . And get you that dressing gown . DANIELS , MRS . Do n't you worry , Sena . I 'm getting dressed anyway . Do n't want to be late today . Not after Madam gave me all yesterday afternoon off . Would seem ungrateful , like . p. 75 DANIELS ( from kitchen ) Okay , Ma ! DANIELS , MRS . ( Sena enters to set the table for breakfast . ) DANIELS ( already dressed , comes in ) Ma says Davey 's not back yet . DANIELS No . Bur you know what it 's like . When those boys have a party , they 's often as not come home till breakfast . More light floods the stage , to suggest daylight coming in . DANIELS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ready by now . DANIELS Want me to help ? DANIELS ( from kitchen ) No thanks ! DANIELS , MRS. ( fully dressed now ) I still ca n't make it out . The first time he 's been out with a crowd of boys . And now this ! DANIELS He 's sure to get here any minute now . DANIELS , MRS . I do n't understand it ! I just do n't understand it . Ca n't get the feel of that dream out of my mind ... Just ca n't .... BETTY and SENA set the table , bring on coffee , bread and jam . DANIELS , MRS . Just wait till he gets in ! A good piece of my mind I 'll give him ! p. 76 DANIELS Yes Ma , you just tell him his fortune ! DANIELS It 's well after eight already . DANIELS , MRS . I told my Madam I 'd be in early this morning ... DANIELS In that case you 'd better go . DANIELS , MRS . I wonder if you could go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davey 's not well . Or I 'm not well . Oh- anything . Anyway , tell her I 'm not coming in today . DANIELS Oh Ma ! And you never staying away from work with ANY excuse ! DANIELS You sure you want me to phone , Ma ? AHLIE comes slowly up the stage , hesitates at the porch as if to turn back , makes up his mind , and resolutely advances to the front door to knock . DANIELS ( opens the front door ) Oh ! You ! GAMALDIEN ( awkward ) Yes , me . DANIELS Where 's Davey ? GAMALDIEN ' S matter of fact : that 's why I 'm here . DANIELS What ... what do you mean ... GAMALDIEN I ... I sort of thought it my duty to come and tell you .... p. 77 DANIELS Tell us what ? For God 's sake ! Tell us what ? GAMALDIEN We-ell , Davey 's sort of got into trouble .... DANIELS , MRS. ( calls from inside ) Who 's there , Sena ? I wish you 'd get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering where I am ! DANIELS It 's not Davey , is it ? DANIELS , MRS . Davey ? It 's Davey , is it ? It 's you ! Ahlie Gamaldien ! GAMALDIEN Yes , Mrs Daniels , I been to see Davey , ' n he asked me to come along and explain .... DANIELS , MRS . So ! He 's sent you ahead ! Probably with a pack of lies ! Well , tell him to come and face me like a man ! Not for you to come and do his dirty work for him ! I 've a fine mind to ... DANIELS Please , Ma ! Let Ahlie explain . ( To Ahlie ) What 's happened ? How do you mean , " sort of got into trouble " ? DANIELS , MRS . Got into trouble ? GAMALDIEN Mind if I come in ? DANIELS Yes , yes , come in . Where is Davey ? Is he alright ? DANIELS , MRS. ( hysterical ) He 's hurt ! I could feel it coming ! I knew it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident and got hurt ! Oh , my poor boy ! My poor boy ! p. 78 DANIELS Is he in a hospital ? GAMALDIEN Er- no . Actually , in prison . DANIELS In prison ? DANIELS Prison ! DANIELS , MRS . In prison ! I DO N'T BELIEVE IT ! GAMALDIEN As you please . So , why do n't you go and have a look yourself ? They let me see him at the police station this morning . DANIELS , MRS . If this is your idea of a joke ! GAMALDIEN Honest , Mrs Daniels . I tried to stop him . I did my best , honest . But a sort of madness came over him ... DANIELS What happened , Ahlie ? GAMALDIEN Well , you see , we had this party going on . We were making a lot of noise , that 's true . So somebody called the police . Disturbance of the peace , you see . DANIELS , MRS . And quite right too ! I always say . GAMALDIEN Yeah , yeah , Mrs Daniels , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police . So , now you ' caught in your own net ! DANIELS , MRS . The nerve of it ! How DARE you speak to me like that ! p. 79 DANIELS Ahlie ! Tell us what HAPPENED ! GAMALDIEN Okay , okay ! Well , this European policeman turns up and tells us to shut up . Well , we are all reasonable like . ( Pause ) That is , all except Davey . DANIELS What did he DO ? GAMALDIEN ( talking fast , reliving the incident ) Well , Davey sort of looks at him . Strange like . Almost like he was looking past the policeman , right through the policeman . It gave me the creeps to see his eyes . Real weird it was . ( Shudders at the recollection ) DANIELS Cut the dramatics ! What then ? GAMALDIEN Well , he sort of steps forward slowly . Like this . And then he says in a calm , quiet voice , not at all like he was drunk : " YOU , White Lawmakers ! You killed my dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study where ! So our dogs are to die in the streets because they are non-European dogs . " And so on , about dogs and the Shadow of Death . And the policeman laughs . And he says : " What rot ! Animals are not classified on the population register . I 've never heard of such a thing ? What Communist propaganda have you been listening to ? " And then Davey goes really mad : " Murderer , " he shouts " Murderer ! You will die for this ! " And he pushes the policeman over , like he really means to kill him ... p. 80 DANIELS , MRS. ( trance like ) Just like my dream . GAMALDIEN ( politely ) I beg yours , Mrs Daniels ? DANIELS And.and , did he ? GAMALDIEN Kill him ? No . We stopped him . But he got taken away . DANIELS , MRS . Will one of you girls go phone my Madam ? Tell her I wo n't be in today . ( To Ahlie ) And you . You are never to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fair ! Blaming me ! He came out of his own free will ! DANIELS , MRS . You heard me ! Get out ! Get out of my house ! Get OUT ! And do n't put your foot in here again ! Get out ! ( Slams the door , staggers to the table , sits down , and sobs violently ) Go and ring up my Madam , somebody , please ! DANIELS I 'll go ! ( Hesitates , slightly embarrassed ) What shall I say ? DANIELS , MRS . Anything ! Tell her anything you want ! Anything ! Anything ! DANIELS Alright , Ma ... Anything you say ... ( leaves hurriedly ) . DANIELS , MRS . This is the end ! All my work ! My pride . My bragging to the neighbours . All for nothing . Nothing ! His scholarship useless , his exam results , his brains , all for nothing ! For nothing ! p. 81 DANIELS Aw Ma ! Do n't take it like that , Ma ! Please Ma ! ( Goes to sit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hush Ma ! Please Ma ! Do n't take it so hard ! He 'll be out again , and go back to studying . YOU know how clever he is . Oh Ma ! Please , please Ma ... DANIELS , MRS . How shall I face Mr Parker ? How can I tell him ? And my Madam ? Real proud of him she was ! Oh ! Oh , never did I dream to see the day my Davey would be going to the dogs ! DANIELS Please Ma ! Do n't take it so badly , please ! DANIELS , MRS . Just like my dream : Going to the dogs . My Davey , going to the dogs ..... DANIELS ( buries her head in her mother 's lap ) Oh Ma , Ma , Ma ... CURTAIN . p. 82 Act 2 , Scene 3 TWILIGHT . TWO WEEKS LATER . Behind the scenes , far away , dreamy music , the soft strumming of guitars . BETTY slowly takes down washing hung on the porch outside . Her body sways gently to the rhythm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come sauntering along . GAMALDIEN ( to his friends ) You go ahead , boys ! FRIENDS move on . GAMALDIEN Hi Betty ! DANIELS Oh ? ( Hesitant , uncertain ) Hello ... GAMALDIEN How 's things ? DANIELS Fine . I 'm fine , thanks . GAMALDIEN Family not in ? DANIELS No . They 've gone to visit Davey . It 's visiting at Roland Street today ... GAMALDIEN Yeah , I know . DANIELS He 's going to be in at least three months . GAMALDIEN Yeah , so I heard . Got an easy sentence . Lucky he got Mr Parker as a character witness . ( An awkward pause ) Your mother still mad at me ? DANIELS Yes . And you ca n't really blame her . p. 83 GAMALDIEN I suppose not . What time are you expecting them back ? So I can be off before your mother 's vicious snake of a tongue has another go at me ! DANIELS You ca n't blame her ! GAMALDIEN You said so before . And I agreed , Did I , or did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is Sena still sore at me too ? DANIELS Yes . She asked you not to take Davey along . GAMALDIEN Is she ... is she very sore at me ? DANIELS Yes , yes she is very sore at you . There 's also that thing that happened on the porch New Year 's Eve : You and me together GAMALDIEN Yeah ? DANIELS Sena saw us , you know . She came out on the porch to look for us . And found us , you know . So , yes , Sena is very sore at you . GAMALDIEN And you ? Are you sore at me too ? DANIELS I ... I ... GAMALDIEN Not you ? ( Pause ) I hear you went to hear our group at Newlands . DANIELS Yes ... Yes , I did . p. 84 GAMALDIEN So YOU ca n't be all that sore at me . And not about that little kiss on the porch . DANIELS We-ell no . I 'm not all that sore at you . ( Pause ) And it was n't such a LITTLE kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a good , long , BIG kiss ! ( He puts his arms around Betty at both sides , leaning his hands against the wall , preventing her from making an escape without actually touching her ) So , what did you think of my song ? My song for a girl behind the yellow door ? DANIELS It was really nice . GAMALDIEN ( looks into Betty 's eyes , sings the last verse of his song ) When I walk , joke , and sing with the boys today , My thoughts will go and stray , Wanting her , wanting her more and more . Girl of Dreams , behind the yellow door , Behind the yellow door , Behind the yellow door . GAMALDIEN What do you think of it , hey ? DANIELS It .. it 's truly lovely , Ahlie . GAMALDIEN Thanks . DANIELS It 's for Sena , of course . p. 85 GAMALDIEN Who says ? DANIELS Everybody says so ! Everybody KNOWS ! GAMALDIEN Well ! It 's not for Sena any more ! Not since she turned so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ! The words just do n't fit Sena any more ! Ha ! Just listen to this : You 'll not find a girl like her so sweet , Dearest one who lives on Second Street .... The words just do n't fit anymore ! ( Long pause ) You can sort of say the song WAS for Sena . DANIELS You ca n't really blame her ! GAMALDIEN You keep saying that ! DANIELS ( stubborn ) Well . it 's true . GAMALDIEN Okay , okay . It may be true , but if you 're really gone on a person , you 'll forgive them anything ! No matter what ! DANIELS Are you still gone on ... I mean , do you still love Sena ? GAMALDIEN Let 's change the subject ! That 's a very nice blouse you got on , for instance . DANIELS I 'm glad you like it . GAMALDIEN You should wear them bright colours more often . p. 86 DANIELS You really think so ? GAMALDIEN Sure I do ! Or I would n't say so ! ( Pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes ) Come . Let 's go inside . DANIELS Inside ! GAMALDIEN Yeah , inside . Come on ! DANIELS No Ahlie ! We ca n't ! GAMALDIEN Scared your Mom will be back any minute ? DANIELS No , it 's not that ! They wo n't be back till eight or after . They 're going to see Aunt Ellie in Woodstock after .... GAMALDIEN Well , what 's to stop us then ? It 's not yet gone seven . That gives us plenty of time ! DANIELS I told you ! It 's not that ! GAMALDIEN Come inside ! DANIELS Ahlie ! No ! What if Mrs Raymond sees ! GAMALDIEN To hell with Mrs Raymond ! ( Pushes the door closed with his foot ) DANIELS ( leaning against the door ) Ahlie ! We must n't ! GAMALDIEN ( very gentle now ) Come , little one .

( Kisses her gently , softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this position for several seconds . p. 87 GAMALDIEN ( releasing her ) There , Betty . My little Betty-bird . DANIELS ( smiling softly , takes both his hands , and draws him toward her . She pulls him toward the bedroom doors . When she speaks , her voice is slow and seductive ) Come ! Come then ! BETTY and AHLIE move across the stage in an almost trance like state . QUICK CURTAIN.CURTAIN RISES SHORTLY . DANIELS ( untidy and dishevelled , looks at herself in the mirror hanging on the wall between the two doors . Pulls the hair away from her face , gazes at her own reflection ) Betty Daniels ... ( Going even more closely to the mirror image ) Betty Daniels . Is that I , Betty Daniels ? ( Suddenly harsh and cold ) Betty Daniels ! What have you done ! MRS DANIELS and SENA , both wearing headscarves , enter . Both appear bowed down and tired . DANIELS , MRS. and he seemed so pleased with the fruit . Do you think they get enough to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rice and water . Or is it bread and water ? But Davey does n't look like it .... DANIELS , MRS . No . He looks alright ... Lucky it 's summer . DANIELS Hey Ma ? Why ? ( Going up the steps , opening the front door ) . p. 88 DANIELS , MRS . Well , so one knows he does n't get too cold at night . Those cells must be bitter .... DANIELS ( hurriedly tidies herself ) Oh , oh , oh ... DANIELS , MRS. ( following Sena ) Is n't Betty in ? DANIELS ( turns round quickly ) Oh ! Hello Ma ! DANIELS , MRS . What you standing like that for ? Like a statue ? You crazy , or something ? DANIELS Hello , Betty ... DANIELS I just brought some washing in . DANIELS , MRS . I do n't see no washing in your hands . DANIELS Oh Ma ! Do n't go on so ! ( Pause ) How 's Davey ? DANIELS , MRS . Seems healthy enough . DANIELS Did ... did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DANIELS Oh , thankyou . DANIELS , MRS . The least you could have done was get a bite ready . Me ' n Sena 's very tired . It 's a long way DANIELS Oh , sorry Ma . I ... I meant to ... p. 89 DANIELS , MRS. ( struggles out of her jacket ) Well then , why did n't you ? There 's nobody here to stop you ! DANIELS I ... I must have fallen asleep . ( Close to tears ) I 'll get something now . ( Turns toward the kitchen ) DANIELS ( puts her hand on Betty 's arm ) You must n't mind Ma too much . She 's tired , and upset . DANIELS , MRS . So would you be ! If you was a mother , proud to bursting of her son , ' n he gets turned around like that ! Proud to bursting I was , ' n now I look the other way when I meet my neighbours in the street ! Why , I even turn away when I meet Mrs Raymond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even look her in the face ! So shamed am I ! ' N when she asks me how 's Davey .... DANIELS Oh Ma ! Mrs Raymond does n't mind . She 's got a boy in Tokai herself . DANIELS , MRS . That 's different . When a boy goes to Reformatory , you can always say he was too young to know any better . Besides , Mrs Raymond applied to the magistrate herself to have him taken there because she could n't handle him herself . DANIELS That 's what she tells US ! DANIELS , MRS . Well , the Daniels ' are different . No one could point a finger at them till three weeks ago . And now it 's .... p. 90 DANIELS Oh , Ma ! PLEASE ! MRS RAYMOND comes dashing up the porch , waving a newspaper , and rushes in without knocking . RAYMOND , MRS . Ahlie ! Ahlie ! Ahlie ! That marvellous boy ! I knew it , I knew it all along !

I TOLD you . Dolly SAW him ! DANIELS , MRS . Dolly saw him where ? RAYMOND , MRS . Here , of course ! Here ! Where has our Ahlie gone off to ? Ahlie , the Golden Dixies ' Sunshine Boy ! Hip-hip-hooray ! DANIELS , MRS . When ? When did Dolly see him ? RAYMOND , MRS. ( folding open the newspaper ) Look at his photograph here ! Just the same as Dolly got in her room . Autographed ' n all . Look at that smile of his ! Even without the singing , that smile will get him to the top of any tree ! p. 91 DANIELS Can . can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My , my , you must be feeling mighty proud of that boy of yours ! Did he know half an hour ago ? Did anyone tell him ? Had he seen the paper ? DANIELS I Have n't seen him for more than two weeks . When he came to tell us about Davey was the last time I saw him .... DANIELS , MRS. ( hysterically ) Then it was Betty ! Betty dared to let him in here ! Gave him food and coffee like Sena before her , I would n't wonder ! And her engaged to a respectable man .... RAYMOND , MRS . Just look what they say here in the " Argus " ! ' N mark my words , Mrs Daniels , you 'll be proud your girls gave him all the eggs and coffee in Athlone ! Look what it says ! JUDGES AWARD GRAND PRIZE !

Now will you please clear the front of my house . Or I 'll have you hauled off by the police ! GAMALDIEN ( turns to the crowd ) Any other girls , Christian or Malay , for my brides ? GIRLS ( shrieking with delight ) Here ! Here , Ahlie ! Here ! GIRL in a yellow dress comes rushing from the audience downstairs with a huge bouquet of garden flowers . GIRL IN YELLOW DRESS ( reaches the stage , tosses the flowers to Ahlie ) Here , Ahlie ! Here ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Scatters the flowers ) For my brides ! CROWD ( laughing and shrieking ) For his brides ! ALL move off , singing Ahlie 's song . SENA and Betty remain standing on the otherwise empty stage . CURTAIN . GIRL IN THE YELLOW DRESS crosses the stage . She picks up one of the flowers thrown down by Ahlie , holds it against her cheek with a dreamy expression , and slowly makes an exit. @x THREE MONTHS LATER . Early evening before the lights come on . BEFORE THE CURTAIN RISES , a mother is heard to sing a lullaby : Sleep , my brown one , sleep sweet , Soon your hunger will fleet ; Arms that seek my empty breast , Find there cosiness and rest ; ' Morrow morn if God will , All your crying will still , ' Morrow morn if God will , All your crying will still . THE CURTAIN RISES NEAR THE END OF THE VERSE . MRS DANIELS and MRS RAYMOND stand on the porch in a listening attitude . DAVEY , in the armchair in the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading a newspaper spread out on the table , looks up to listen as well . RAYMOND , MRS . Well , Mrs Bloom 's little one 's quiet at last . That crying was something terrible . DANIELS , MRS . Yes . On and ON it went , something terrible . RAYMOND , MRS . Never you mind . You should hear it on my side . Oh ! Hush ! ALL assume a waiting attitude . MOTHER 'S VOICE ( continues her singing ) Sleep , my brown one , sleep long , Soon angels will throng , With sweet dreams they will feed you , Misery away they 'll shoo ; If the Lord will ordain , You will feel no more pain , If the Lord will ordain , You will not thirst again . p. 96 DANIELS , MRS . I hear the baby is very ill . RAYMOND , MRS . Yes , the doctor came by this afternoon . I hear he 's calling again this evening . Undernourished he said it was . But can you blame Mrs Bloom with eight living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasterenteritis I think he said it was , it does n't stand much of a chance . DANIELS , MRS . Shame . Poor mite . Such a nice baby too . Well , I better be getting inside . Want to step along too ? RAYMOND , MRS . Do n't mind if I do ! ( Both enter the living room together ) DANIELS eagerly , reading from the newspaper ) Listen to this one , Davey ! Matriculated Coloured boy wanted for office in Athlone , And there 's a phone number to call here . Probably one of them electrical equipment factories or furniture places around here . You could save on bus fares , maybe go by bicycle . Does n't that sound marvellous ? DANIELS No . DANIELS Really Davey ! Nothing seems good enough for your liking ! DANIELS I 'm satisfied with things as they are . If I ca n't be a vet and ca n't go to Varsity , it suits me fine around here . DANIELS , MRS. ( ignoring Davey ) Take a seat , Mrs Raymond . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evening Sena . Evening Davey . Your mother 's got some pretty good news for you . DANIELS Oh ? DANIELS , MRS . Yes , Davey ! Just think ! Mr Raymond says there 's an opening at the Stables for you ! He 's already talked to the foreman- ever so nice he is- ' n he says you can come for an interview tomorrow . RAYMOND , MRS . He knows you from before . He remembers how good you were with them horses . Just fancy , hey ? After all these months . Of course Mr Raymond told him about your little trouble , and most understanding he was ! DANIELS Tell him thanks , but I did n't get the third highest Matric results to become a stable boy ! DANIELS , MRS . DAVEY ! How dare you speak like that with Mrs Raymond ! DANIELS Sorry Mrs Raymond , I apologize . RAYMOND , MRS. ( embarrassed ) Ach well , I can understand how you feel . But Mr Raymond thought seeing how you like to be with them horses .... DANIELS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll wait till something more suitable turns up . Tell Mr Raymond " thankyou " anyway . RAYMOND , MRS. ( awkward ) Right , I 'll do that , ( Eager to change the subject ) Betty not in ? p. 98 DANIELS She went out about three o'clock . DANIELS , MRS . Where to ? DANIELS She did n't say . DANIELS , MRS . That girl is getting closer by the day ! RAYMOND , MRS . What 's biting her ? She 's not been looking well . Got very thin just lately too . DANIELS , MRS . Yes , Mrs Farida , the dressmaker , had to take in her wedding dress inches all the way . RAYMOND , MRS . Aaaach . Wedding nerves , I suppose . DANIELS , MRS . I 'm not so sure .... There 's something else bothering that child . Picking at her food , mumbling in her sleep . Real worried I 'm getting . RAYMOND , MRS . Aaach , Mrs Daniels , it 's no use worrying . If you worry , you die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is n't that how the saying goes ? DANIELS , MRS . Yes , that 's what my dead husband always used to say . But you see what 's most worrying : suddenly she could n't pay me the bit of money she always gives toward the housekeeping like she always did . RAYMOND , MRS . Oh , that 's easy to understand , what with a trousseau and all . p. 99 DANIELS , MRS . But that 's the most worrying part . She has n't bought a single thing ! And when we needed an extra yard of brocade for the wedding dress , she told Mrs Farida to ask me for it . She could n't even pay for that out of her own pocket ! RAYMOND , MRS . That IS funny , I must say . GEORGE comes purposefully up the porch steps , and knocks loudly . DANIELS I 'll go see who it is . ( Opens the door ) Oh ! Good evening , George . ( Puzzled ) Is n't Betty with you ? ISAACSON Why , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no she went out . I ... I thought she said she was going to meet you .... ISAACSON Meet me ? No , there must be some mistake .... DANIELS Oh well , she ca n't be much longer now . She 's been gone since three . Come on in , anyway . ISAACSON Thankyou . Good evening , Mrs Daniels . Good evening , Mrs Raymond . Hello , Davey . DANIELS , MRS . Hello George ! Come right in and make yourself at home . RAYMOND , MRS . Evening ! DANIELS Hi ! p. 100 ISAACSON ( to Davey ) Given any more thought to that suggestion of mine to become a teacher ? DANIELS Yeah . ISAACSON Well ? ( Long silence , with no reply from Davey ) I told you I 'd help in applying for a loan . The academic year has just started , and I 've got influence in certain circles . Also , I told Betty we 'd give some help financially . DANIELS Yeah . You said so the day before yesterday . ISAACSON Well , shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to lose . DANIELS No thanks . Teaching does n't suit my talents . I got a knack with animals , not kids . DANIELS , MRS . Oh Davey ! With George taking all that trouble ! DANIELS I never asked him to take the trouble on himself , thanks . ISAACSON ( scornfully ) Even your speech has deteriorated ! DANIELS They do n't go in for elocution lessons in Roeland Street , you know . ISAACSON I came round because I 'm a bit worried about Betty . DANIELS , MRS . Oh ? p. 101 ISAACSON She has n't seemed well . And this morning she was as nervous as a cat . DANIELS , MRS . Just wedding nerves , George . Just wedding nerves , I 'm sure . RAYMOND , MRS . Yeah , yeah . Just wedding nerves , like I said to Mrs Daniels just minutes ago . DANIELS And Mrs Bloom 's baby just the other side of Mrs Raymond kept us awake all night . No one got any sleep around here , I can tell you ! ISAACSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everybody 's below par if they do n't get a proper night 's rest . ( Pause ) . Betty told me about the baby being very ill . RAYMOND , MRS . Yeah Gasterenteritis or something like that . The doctor does n't think it 'll make it . ISAACSON Maybe that 's it . Betty 's such a softhearted kid . DANIELS , MRS . She always was . Ever since she was THAT high . Much TOO softhearted my dead husband used to say . Much too softhearted for this here hard world . ISAACSON Well , there 's me to take care of her now . ( Pause ) Do you suppose she went for her fitting ? She told me her dress had to be taken in again . p. 102 DANIELS , MRS . I suppose so . Yes . I 'm almost sure she told me this morning she has to go for another fitting . DANIELS Why do n't you stay for a bite of supper , George ? ISAACSON Right . I 'd like to do that . RAYMOND , MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for supper that needs warming up . DANIELS , MRS . And will you have a peep in at Mrs Bloom 's too ? And if she wants any help , just send someone around with a message . RAYMOND , MRS . Right-oh ! ' Bye for now . I hope Betty wo n't be long now ! DANIELS Goodbye , Mrs Raymond ! DANIELS , MRS . So . You 're worried about our Betty ? ISAACSON Yes , I really am . Have n't you noticed too ? DANIELS , MRS . Yes , I 've noticed too . ( Awkward pause ) George , I hope you 'll take this from me . I ... I want to ask you a very personal question ... ISAACSON Go right ahead , Mrs Daniels . DOLLY comes rushing up the porch , bursts in without knocking . DANIELS , MRS . It 's a bit difficult to put with Davey sitting there . But ... have you and Betty ... I mean , have the two of you ... you know ... have you ( Looks at Dolly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Has your mother sent you with a message from Mrs Bloom ? Is there something wrong , Dolly ? Come on , speak up ! p. 103 DOLLY There 's a lot wrong . Only , it 's not Mrs Bloom 's baby ! DANIELS , MRS . What is it then , Dolly ? What 's happened ? DOLLY It 's Davey ! ( Passionately ) Take a good look at me , Davey ! DANIELS Yeah , yeah , I 'm looking . DOLLY I hate you ! All the trouble my Dad 's gone to ! Just to get you taken on at the Stables . And you turn up your snotty nose ! DANIELS Look , Dolly . I already explained to your Mom . I did n't get a First Class Matric with distinctions to work as a stable boy ! DOLLY And all those months you pretended you loved them horses ! DANIELS I did n't PRETEND . I STILL love them ! DOLLY Then you would n't be such a snob about it ! BETTY comes staggering across the stage , her face contorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps , and almost falls through the door . DOLLY ( still shouting ) If you really loved them horses you 'd work with them if you got a First Class or a Tenth Class Matric ! The pay is jolly decent . AND the Municipality gives you decent time off . Why do you turn your nose up at it ? Why , why , why ? p. 104 DANIELS , MRS . Look , we 've been through all that with Davey . It 's no use .... BETTY ! ISAACSON Betty ! What is the matter ? Betty , what 's wrong ? ( Supporting her ) You 're ill ! Tell me what the matter is ! DANIELS Just help me ... help me get to my bed ... I do n't think I can manage alone .... DANIELS , MRS . You better go home , Dolly . DOLLY ( already edging her way out ) Right-oh , Mrs Daniels . Bye for now , Davey .... DANIELS ( anxiously watches as GEORGE and MRS DANIELS assist Betty ) Bye Dolly .... DANIELS ( emerges from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Notices Betty being supported on both sides ) Betty ! What 's happened ? What 's the matter ? DANIELS , MRS . You just take over there on George 's side , Sena . DANIELS ( supporting Betty on the other side ) But what 's wrong ? What 's the matter with her ? Has something happened ? DANIELS , MRS . Let 's get her to bed first ! ISAACSON ( distressed ) Is there anything I can do ? p. 105 DANIELS , MRS . Not at the moment , George . DANIELS ( stunned ) What 's the matter with her , George ? Did she have an accident ? ISAACSON I do n't know .... DANIELS , MRS. ( coming out of the bedroom ) George ! Why did she have to do it ? Why did you let her ? ISAACSON I .... I 'm afraid I do n't quite understand .... DANIELS , MRS . Why did she have to go to a woman ? Why could n't she just leave it be with you getting married next month ! ISAACSON ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand ... ( Goes to sit down at the table ) . DANIELS , MRS.

I suppose she wanted to spare you the worry ... ISAACSON No . No , that is n't it . DANIELS , MRS . No ? p. 106 ISAACSON You see , Mrs Daniels , there was never anything like that between Betty and me ? I respected her , you see . I was willing to wait .... DANIELS , MRS. ( horrified ) George ! ISAACSON And that 's a fact , Mrs Daniels . I had too much respect for that girl . I would never have believed she 'd let ANY chap . Without being married , I mean . DANIELS , MRS. ( rocking to and fro ) Oh no ! Oh no , no , no , no . ISAACSON I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you ... DANIELS , MRS . I guess she was afraid the wedding would have to be stopped ... ISAACSON I suppose so . ( A long pause ) Now , Mrs Daniels , I want you to tell Betty I have no hard feelings . Whatever happens , we 'll go through with that wedding . DANIELS , MRS . Oh , George , George ! I ca n't believe any one can be this good , this kind .... ISAACSON I love Betty , you see , Mrs Daniels . Only I feel hurt she did n't trust me enough to tell me ! I ...

ISAACSON I refuse to believe it ! I just ca n't believe it ! Dr Joel must be wrong ! Betty is young , and she 's been fit and healthy ! Doctors are often wrong ! DANIELS , MRS . Well , he said there was a little hope . But I prepare myself for the worst . Then it wo n't be quite so hard when Sena comes with the news ... DANIELS Ach man , Ma !

DANIELS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marvels of Modern Medicine . I 'm really too tired to listen any more .... DANIELS But do n't you understand , Ma ! The longer we have to wait , the more hope there is ! It means those doctors are fighting for her life still ! If it was all over , Sena would have been back with the news ! p. 109 DANIELS , MRS . I do n't know .... It takes a long time to sign them post mortem papers and all . I remember from when your father died in hospital . DANIELS I do n't understand our people ! They accept death so readily ! Look at Mrs Bloom , and now you ! DANIELS , MRS . It 's because Death comes to us so often . ( Quietly ) Like being poor . We 've been made to take it every-day like , like part of living , you might say . ISAACSON Your mother is right , Davey . Leave her alone . DANIELS But it need n't be so ! Do n't you see Ma , if our people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MRS . PLEASE , Davey . Give it a rest ! Anyone for more coffee ? ISAACSON Yes thanks . DANIELS ( pacing restlessly up and down ) No thanks , Ma . DANIELS , MRS . I should have gone with her in the ambulance . But I was so upset .... ISAACSON That 's to understand , Mrs Daniels . DANIELS , MRS . I 'll never forgive myself ! She should have had her mother there at the last . p. 110 DANIELS Oh , MA ! PLEASE ! SENA comes slowly across stage . Extreme weariness and sadness are expressed in every gesture . She is wearing a short jacket and a headscarf . ISAACSON I think I 'll go to the corner phone booth and ring the hospital .

At first she seemed to get better . At half past four she had another haemorrhage . There was nothing more they could do . A nurse was beside her all the time . I sat with her . " Forgive me , Sena " , was what she kept saying . ( She moves toward the table , and sits down ) Forgive me , Sena , forgive , me , Sena .... Tho ' for what I do not know . She would n't say . ISAACSON ( trying to master his feelings ) Well , I 'll be going then . ( To Mrs Daniels ) Did you tell her ? Before she left in the ambulance ? About no hard feelings ?

But he asked me to tell her the wedding was still on . He ... he still loved her . Was ready to forgive anything . No more questions asked . DANIELS No questions ? Who , then ? Who ? DANIELS , MRS . I 'm glad she had at least that at the end . DANIELS Yes . Yes , me too . I ... I 'll pour myself some coffee . I had a very long night ... DANIELS ( his voice thick with tears ) Coffee !

AHLIE comes slowly on stage , mounts the porch , and knocks respectfully . DANIELS I 'll go and see who it is . ( Opens the door ) Oh , hello Ahlie . GAMALDIEN Please , can I come in ?

To pay my respects . GAMALDIEN I done that on my way here . Mr Bloom was up all night hammering a little coffin for it . ' N Mrs Bloom was just laying the baby down in it , like she was putting it to sleep in its crib ... ALL remain silent for several seconds . GAMALDIEN But that 's not really why I came round here . What I really called about is something different ... DANIELS , MRS . Yes ? GAMALDIEN Only , I do n't know if now 's the time ... DANIELS , MRS . Go on . Is there something you feel we ought to know ? GAMALDIEN Well , you see , I 've been to see Mr Parker ? DANIELS , MRS . Mr Parker ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , Mr Parker . He says he can still arrange for Davey to get late admission to Varsity , that is , if he pays . It 's too late for the scholarship this year . But maybe it can be rearranged for next year . Mr Parker can arrange to get Davey in again . Only it would mean paying privately like , just for this year ... p. 114 DANIELS , MRS . Even so . I do n't see how it applies . We do n't have private funds , as they say . GAMALDIEN Well , that 's where I come in . Well , that Grand Prize money . I put it in the bank just like that . Have n't touched it yet . I booked a passage to go to England in September , so there 's plenty of time to cancel . Also , I been offered a job two evenings a week singing . Some posh European place . So , that 's all extra .

I do n't think it would be fair to take your prize money . Like it was n't fair of me to put all the blame on you for Davey 's trouble . GAMALDIEN ( to Davey ) Please take the money from me ! Ever since I heard about Betty last night , I 've been thinking it out ! DANIELS , MRS . About Betty ? I do n't see what that has to do with THIS ? p. 115 GAMALDIEN Please , Davey !

DANIELS I think I do know , Ahlie . GAMALDIEN You do ? Did Betty ... DANIELS I do n't want you to tell me . And , even if you did , it would make no difference .

Remember the question I popped ? DANIELS I remember . GAMALDIEN And you said you would give me your answer . DANIELS I can not give you any answer yet .

( They begin to move away ) p. 118 DANIELS If I keep on the move , perhaps the tightness in here will ease off a bit . It hurts in my chest , like where I kept my crying inside . I just could n't keep still just now . ( Go offstage together ) MRS DANIELS and DAVEY sit quietly at the table . DANIELS , MRS . Funny , a dream I had months ago keeps coming back to me . Ca n't get that dream out of my mind . DANIELS A dream ? DANIELS , MRS . I told Sena at the time . A horrible dream . A dreadful dream . ( Pause ) And now it 's like it has come true .

I 'll be back as soon as I can , Ma . DANIELS , MRS . Goodbye , Davey . DAVEY goes off , purposefully and quickly . DANIELS , MRS. ( stares solidly ahead , her features contorted with suffering . During the singing of Mrs Bloom 's lullaby , she lets her head fall wearily on her arms , stretched out on top of the table .

You do not hear me weep , Or your brother 's mournful cry , With Death Angels brushing by , It was our dear God 's will , That your crying be still , It was our dear God 's will , That your hunger be still .
