Despite the heavier fighting that has marked most regions of South Viet Nam in recent weeks , the Delta remained notably quiet . Then last week the country 's richest and most populous area suddenly erupted in two major battles , including one that turned into the Communists ' biggest defeat of the war in the Delta . The battles were remarkable for two reasons . One was that the Delta is still the sole domain of indigenous Viet Cong forces , some 80,000 strong , who seldom choose to do battle in the large numbers and on the scale of their North Vietnamese allies operating farther north . The other was that the Allied forces that inflicted the damage on the Delta Viet Cong were largely South Vietnamese , who have sometimes been accused of having an " accommodation " with the local Viet Cong to avoid bloodletting . <P> The first fight began when a 62-boat Allied flotilla churning up the Rach Ruong Canal 65 miles southwest of Saigon was suddenly hit by intense fire . It carried a battalion of Vietnamese Marines and a battalion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm of Operation Coronado 9 . The Vietnamese troops were in the lead boats , and when rockets began to rip through the flotilla 's armor plate , Major Pham Nha , the Vietnamese Marine battalion commander , made an instant decision to counterattack . " We 're in an ambush and we are going in , " ordered Nha , without waiting for artillery and air support . Seconds later , Nha 's troop carriers rammed into the canal bank and his Marines stormed ashore . <P> <P> Bunker by Bunker . Nha 's Marines drove in on the enemy from the north and east . The U.S. battalion jumped ashore and set up a position on the south , and another U.S. battalion was helilifted in on the west . Boxed in , the Viet Cong 's 502nd Battalion fought with the bitterness of despair . Sometimes neck-deep in water , wallowing in mud , the Vietnamese Marines moved in bunker by bunker , dropping grenades into the Viet Cong firing slits and forcing the Viet Cong in the dikes out into the open , where air support and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Marines paid dearly for their courage , suffering 41 dead and 162 wounded ; U.S. losses were 13 killed and 73 wounded . But at the end of the daylong battle , 235 Viet Cong bodies were awash in the paddy waters . <P> The second battle was entirely a Vietnamese victory . Two companies of a Ranger battalion were moving along a canal line 22 miles southwest of the Delta 's largest city , Can Tho , when they ran into two Viet Cong battalions : the local force U Minh 10 and the 303rd main force unit . In a fierce fight that raged through most of one day , the South Vietnamese killed 265 of the V.C. , and supporting helicopters and fighter-bombers accounted for another 100 dead . The total of 365 enemy dead was the largest ever inflicted in a Delta battle , with more probably to come as fighting continued at week 's end . Moreover , the Communist casualties were so youthful-between 15 and 20 years of age-that Allied intelligence took that as a sure sign that the Viet Cong are having trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
