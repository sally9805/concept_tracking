IN the category-making so dear to journalism , the city generally comes under the file marked Problems . The subject suggests TV panels where earnest sociologists talk of urban renewal , of megalopolis , juvenile delinquency , blight , population movement and traffic . The mayors of these vast places seem to spend their time either shaking hands with somebody for the photographers or complaining of their burdens . TIME , a city-made product itself , takes up the subject this week by selecting , but not at random , the mayors of five U.S. cities-New York , Chicago , Boston , Houston and Los Angeles .

The TIME bureaus of five cities contributed their thousands of words , and the story was researched by Dorothea Bourne , who in girlhood lived on a ten-acre ranch that is now part of the city of Los Angeles .

But some of the out-of-the-way stories in the issue are not to be missed . Just as France 's famed gourmet Guide Michelin ( see THE WORLD ) confers one , two or three stars on France 's best restaurants and decrees which are " worth a detour , ' ' our own chefs have a few specialties de la maison to commend : <P> The girl in the suitcase , or how to get out of Communist East Germany in the worst way ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the first player does n't seem to have a chance , one of the more comprehensible features of the new French movie , Last Year at Marienbad ( see MODERN LIVING ) . <P> The way in which Tula Ellice Finklea , Doris Kappelhoff , Archie Leach , Frederick Austerlitz , Norma Jeane Baker , Dino Crecetti and Roy Fitzgerald became household names , though not their own ( see SHOW BUSINESS ) . <P> Once these appetizers have been sampled , either on a detour or in their proper sequence , the rest of the news may be approached in a confident frame of mind . It has never been a TIME rule that the magazine must be read from front to back , though most people do . Those who skip ahead to their favorite section-whether it be People , Medicine or Art-or take a preliminary skim of the magazine , just looking at the pictures and reading what catches their eye , have our affection too . We have a first page but not a Front Page , and the writers and editors in what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theirs too is the Front Page news in their field .
