In its 2,500 years , Persia has been overrun by conquerors ranging from Alexander the Great to Omar I the Caliph to Tamerlane . Never had it witnessed such a visitation as last week , when the grandeur of Charles de Gaulle met the pomp of the Peacock Throne . <P> At Teheran , le grand Charles was welcomed by Iran 's Shahanshah , Mohammed Reza Pahlevi , and his lovely Empress , Farah Diba-who share dulcet memories of France , since the Shah first met his young Queen-to-be while she was an architecture student in Paris . Through flag-bedecked streets rode De Gaulle in a gilded state carriage . Along the route , crowds chanted " Zindehbad long live De Gaulle , " which turned out to be a particularly poetic cheer , since the visitor 's name sounds like " Two Flowers " in Farsi , the Persian tongue . Ignoring Draconian security measures , Two Flowers moved right into the crowd and shook hundreds of outstretched hands just as if he were at home . He toured the ancient cities of Shiraz , Isfahan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mausoleum of the Shah 's father , Reza Shah Pahlevi . <P> As became apparent last May when he paid a triumphal visit to Greece , De Gaulle has visions of rebuilding France 's influence in the Middle and Near East . At a banquet in Golestan Palace , in private talks with the Shah and his able Premier , Assadollah Alam , the guest repeated his pitch : Iran enjoys a friend in France , which has had treaty relations with the country since Louis XIV . In an address to Parliament , De Gaulle hailed the Shah 's reforms , added that Iran , like France , has preserved dignified independence despite the cold war . He wound up with a grand offer " to contribute efficiently to the development of your country . " <P> Direct French aid to Iran averages less than $1,000,000 a year , mostly in scholarships ( U.S. aid this year is $116 million , has totaled $1.5 billion since the war ) . Indirectly , the Paris government backs $100 million in loans that are facilitating French construction projects in Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more ; for all his ringing words , De Gaulle cited no future aid figures . Yet Iranians , who in the past have had their differences with Washington over the amount and type of U.S. aid received , were pleased to be wooed by De Gaulle . Loaded with gifts of silk Persian rugs , the regal invader prepared to fly off at week 's end , apparently having impressed his host . Slightly starry-eyed , the Shah predicted that De Gaulle 's visit would produce " good things , maybe marvelous things . "
