" I had my secretary tell him about it and I sent him a copy of the telegram , " Mr. explained . He said that he did not remember whether he had notified Mr. Tracy before or after hayign sent the telegram , but added : " What difference does it make , he signed the letter . " Mr. was referring to a letter he received from Mr. Tracy , dated Feb. 23 , in which Mr. Tracy said the ; bridge should be built by interests other than the Triborough .

In his letter to Mr. Moses , Mr. Laughlin said " there is no reason why , if New York State and Nassau , Suffolk and Westcheste ? Counties believe the bridge to be in their best interests and want it , they should not have any difficulty organizing a separate authority and financing it . " He added that he was taking into consideration " a number of other things , " including the issuing of S325 million in Triborough Bridge bonds and other present and future Triborough commitments . " Certainly the Mayor and other officials of the city should be consulted , " Mr. said .
