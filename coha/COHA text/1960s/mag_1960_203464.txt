Bye Bye Birdie ( book by Michael Stewart ; music and lyrics by Charles Strouse &; Lee Adams ) is not particularly expert , but it does n't have to be . There is something infectiously and rampageously lively about it . Staged with exuberance by Gower Champion , who is the real hero of the evening , Birdie has the special crazy zip of a bowling ball on the loose , of rifle shots not so much hitting the bull's-eye as overturning the target . <P> The show finds its subject in Conrad Birdie , an Elvis Presleyish crooner , and in his shrieking teen-age worshipers . But happily the show 's object is to uncover fun wherever it lurks , whether in fathers or fantasy , peashooters or TV shows . If so vagrant a method makes things slightly untidy , it also keeps them fresh . Where the method richly pays off is in its not giving Conrad ( well played by Dick Gautier ) too much houseroom , in its saying bye-bye to him oftener than it squeals hello . In the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are often banished between aahs , or missing between oohs , they do not grow oppressive . If Dick Van Dyke and Chita Rivera , as the love interest , never quite make love interesting , they often brighten it with glints of hate and vary it with an amusing roadblock to the altar-Dick 's mother . Zestfully played by Kay Medford , she is a murderously possessive mamma forever jabbering of self-sacrifice , threatening suicide and pleading for a minimum in funerals : " Just wait till Mother 's Day , wrap me in a flag , and dump me in the river . " With contrasting skill , Paul Lynde plays a teen-ager 's father trying to assert himself , first at home , then scene-stealingly on TV . <P> Bye Bye Birdie ranges farthest , and perhaps most enjoyably , afield when Dancer Rivera crashes a Shriners ' dinner and starts a small Keystone Comedy chase , now around the table , now on it , now under it . One reason why Birdie lands on its feet is that it is so seldom off them . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny remarks hastening in one direction , not so funny ones fleeing in another . Musically the show travels rather light , once or twice with an empty suitcase . But Bye Bye Birdie successfully elevates freshness above slickness , playfulness above workmanship , and can boast a spanking enough breeze to explain why things now and then get blown about . <P> A Second String ( adapted by Lucienne Hill from a novel of Colette ) portrays the home life of an egocentric French playwright-philanderer who is almost never at home . Despite his having a secretary-mistress as well as a wife on the premises , he just dashes demandingly in and out . When mistress and wife are not waiting on him , they are waiting for him , while a neglected teen-age son keeps hoping for more from papa than a quick pat on the back , and a sophisticated elderly actress drops by to deliver a few verbal lefts to the chin . In time the wife becomes a sufficiently aware and impatient Griselda to force a showdown with the mistress , only for the two women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
