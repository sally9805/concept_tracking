Bathing suits , like ground hogs , are harbingers of a sort . Flung into department store show windows in the gusty middle of March , they hold the promise of summer in every synthetic strand ; mannequins plant tanned plastic legs in the cardboard surf , shading their painted eyes against a light bulb of a sun , and even the earliest shopper sniffs about anxiously for a hint of sea smell in the icy air .

To the sorrow of the thigh-heavy set , the new pant length is as brief and close-cut as possible . The once-dependable half-skirt ( which could be tugged down to conceal an entire stretch of flab ) is hard to find ; in its place , for those who choose to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but scarcely conceals .
