The paintings poke fun at Madison Avenue 's other life , the world of the ad agencies ; the constructions are funny animals and people built out of everyday objects and lots of whimsy . Through Dec. 7 . <P> BALCOMB GREENE-Saidenberg , 1035 Madison Ave . at 79th St. Greene 's engaging double exposures in muted blues and browns have a deceptively unfinished look . But the white space in his seascapes and street scenes is left there on purpose : to flood the canvases with light .

Through Dec. 7 . <P> ALBERT BIERSTADT-Florence Lewison , 50 East 76th St. These 24 paintings by a master of mammoth landscapes come as a surprise .

Brilliant suns whirl across the canvases , lock in geometrical embraces of color . Through Nov. 30.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
