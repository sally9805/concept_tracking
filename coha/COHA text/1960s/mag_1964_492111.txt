YEAH ! YEAH ! YEAH ! MUSIC 'S GOLD BUGS : THE BEATLES B rian Sommerville is a balding 32-year-old Londoner whose jaw juts out like the southeast corner of England when he thinks he is about to say something important . At Kennedy International Airport in New York last February 7 , Sommerville 's jaw was projecting so far he was almost unable to open his mouth to speak . A thousand screaming teen-agers were trying to wriggle toward a thin white line of a nylon rope that had been stretched across the terminal building lobby . Three thousand more were screaming from behind bulging metal railings atop the roof , where they were the guests of New York disc jockeys , who had invited them to take the day off from school . Next to Sommerville a Ncw York Journal-American photographer was tugging angrily at his arm , shouting , " We bought an exclusive story and we ca n't even get a picture of them looking at us  --  what did we pay you money for ? " At Sommerville 's other arm a phalanx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them into the press room . There was n't space left in the press room anyway , and one of the cops tried to throw out a Capitol Records executive who had arrived without an identification badge . Disc jockeys equipped with tape recorders were pointing cylindrical microphones at the mob . Flashbulbs exploded . From the back of the lobby came word that two girls had fainted . Hemmed in and harassed , Sommerville 's jaw signaled a pronouncement . " This , " he said in the intonations of a nation that has been accustomed to ruling the world , " has gotten entirely out of control . " Sommerville is press officer of a rock-'n ' - roll group known as the Beatles . Their plane had just landed . Amid a fanfare of screeches , there emerged four young Britons in Edwardian four-button suits . One was short and thick-lipped . Another was handsome and peach-fuzzed . A third had a heavy face and the hint of buckteeth . On the fourth , the remnants of adolescent pimples were noticeable . Their names were Ringo Starr , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were otherwise indistinguishable beneath their manes of moplike hair . After they were ushered into the floodlit uproar of the press room , Brian Sommerville , acting as master of ceremonies , stepped to a microphone , again thrust out his jaw and addressed the reporters . " Gentlemen , gentlemen , gentlemen , " he said , " will you please shut up ! " The first question from the American press was , " Do you believe in lunacy ? " " Yeah , " answered one of the Beatles , " it 's healthy . " Another reporter asked , " Would you please sing something ? " " No , " replied another Beatle , " we need money first . " Still another reporter asked , " Do you hope to take anything home with you ? " " Yeah , " a Beatle replied , " Rockefeller Center . " At first , few of the reporters could remember which Beatle was which . But by the end of their two-week visit to America , each of them had become a distinct personality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star . Ringo is the one that some observers have compared to Harpo Marx . He has bright blue eyes that remind one of a child looking through a window , although he sometimes deliberately crosses them as he sits dumbly at the drums playing his corny four-four beat . " 1 hate phonies , " he says with the absolutism of somebody who thinks he can spot one a mile away . " I ca n't stand them . " The most popular of the Beatles in America , he evokes paroxysms of teen-age shrieks everywhere by a mere turn of his head , a motion which sends his brown spaniel hair flying . When he flips his wig , the kids flip theirs . " RIIINNGO ! RIIINNG ' 01 " the kids call out . He acquired the nickname because hP wears two rings on each hand . He wears different rings at different times , changing them like culT links , " 1 like the gold ones , " he says " The fans send a lot of silver ones , too , but I send them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I have 2,761 rings " His fame has brought Ringo other treasures , but he seems not to have forgotten what it was like to grow up amid the grimy row-house streets of Liverpool . He was born Richard Starkey , the only son of a father who was a house painter and a mother who was a barmaid . He never finished school . He was kept out by pleurisy and more than a dozen stomach operations . Also , it seems , he never started growing . Asked how tall he is , he snaps back , " Two feet , nine inches ! " Actually he is five-feet-seven . " When I feel my head starting to swell , " says John Lennon , " 1 just look at Ringo and I know perfectly well we 're not supermen . " Without proper schooling , Ringo worked as an electrician 's apprentice and at various odd jobs before turning to drumming . " When I was sixteen , you know , " he says , " 1 use to walk on the road with the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and we 'd have a few laughs with the rival gangs and then I got the drums and the bloke next door and I got a job and we started playing together and another bloke and me made a bass out of an old tea chest and this was about 1958 , mind you , and we played together and then we started playing on dances and things , you know , and we took an interest in it and we stopped going out and hanging around corners every night . " These days still lie close behind him . When an American reporter asked him if he liked fish and chips , he answered , " Yes , 1 like fish and chips , but I like steak and chips better . " One of his greatest moments was when the Beatles played before Princess Margaret and the Queen Mother at the Royal Command Performance in London last November . " It was the first time I ever felt British , " he says . " You know , you never think about royalty . But the Queen Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his drums behind the group as the other three perform , and he rarely sings , although that is 4tihat he would most like to do . Although , at 23 , he is the oldest of the Beatles , he is at the bottom of what sociologists would call their pecking order . When he joined the group it already had a record contract , and the unspoken feeling in the quartet is that Ringo was hired by the other three . When they disagreeonany thing , Ringo 1 is the last to get his way . " You 'd be nowhere , " Paul McCartney says to him in the ultimate squelch , " if it were n't for the rest of us . " The fans call Paul the handsome one , and he knows it . The others in the group call Paul " The Star . " He does most of the singing and most of the wiggling , trying to swing his hips after the fashion of Elvis Presley , one of his boyhood idols . In the British equivalent of high school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other Beatles . " He was like , you know , a goody-goody in school , " remembers one of Paul 's boyhood friends . He also , as another former classmate remembers him , was a " tubby little kid " who avoided girlish rejections by avoiding girls . He can afford to be much bolder now . At a cocktail party in the British embassy in Washington , a twice-divorced noblewoman put her arms around him , gazed longingly into his eyes and said , " Which one are you ? " " Roger , " he answered . " Roger what ? " she said . " Roger McClusky the fifth , " he answered , and slithered out of her grasp . " Paul is the hardest one to get to know , although that does n't mean he 's the deepest , " says a friend . When the 18-year-old English actress Jill Haworth had a private audience with Paul in Miami Beach , it lasted only a few minutes . " I just could n't find anything to talk to him about , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get started talking . " Paul , who plays bass guitar , wears the same tight pants that are part of the uniform of the Beatles , although he often distinguishes himself with a vest . " Paul , " says one member of the troupe. " is the only one of the boys who 's had it go to his head . " Sometimes , talking with the other Beatles , he finds himself using accents much more high-toned than the working-class slang of Liverpool , where he grew up . When he does , John Lennon mockingly mimics him . Paul and John have collaborated in writing more than 100 songs , including such hits as I Want to Hold Your Hand and She Loves You . " None of us really knows how to read or write music , " says Paul . " The way we work it is like , we just whistle . John will whistle at me , and whistle back at him . " John does n't smile when he sings . " That 's because , " says Neil Aspinall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Beatles , " he 's giving you his soul . " He likes to wear sunglasses both indoors and out , as a sort of declaration of privacy . " John , " says Brian Epstein , the 29-year-old personal manager who discovered the Beatles , " is the most intellectual of the boys . " Though he has a habit of falling asleep at odd moments , he is also the most intense and has a temper that reddens his face at the slightest rub . At a cocktail party in the British embassy after the Beatles ' Washington concert , John found himself besieged by dignitaries , their wives and girl friends , all of whom were thrusting autograph books at him with such official commands as , " Look , sign this for my daughter ! Caw n't think why she likesyou ! Must be out of her mind . " Finally John pushed away the pens . Forcing his way to the bar , he ordered a drink and said , " These people are worse than the fans . These people have no bloody manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we talk the same language . But 1 would n't give a thank you for his friends . " At that moment , a young embassy official approached John and said , " Come now and do your stuff . " John glared back . " I 'm not going back through that crowd  --  I want a drink , " he said . " Oh , yes you are , " the official said imperiously . Livid , John turned to Ringo and said , " I 'm getting out of here ! " With a smile , Ringo put an arm on John 's shoulder and said calmly , " Oh , come on , let 's go and do our stuff and get it over with . " The " stuff " consisted of drawing names out of a box in a charity raffle . John began with ideas of becoming a painter , spending two years at the Liverpool Art Institute . He also writes short stories and poems see pages 40-42 , a collection of which , combined with his sketches , is being published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British hip , a sort of conglomeration of funny Lewis Carroll jabberwocky with a slight tinge of William Burroughs 's Naked Lunch and an almost Joycean word play . " When John first appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show , a subtitle identifying him carried the parenthetical message , " Sorry , girls , he 's married . " His wife Cynthia is a quietly beautiful 21-year-old blondewhom he met at the Liverpool Art Institute and whom the newspapers now call , to the Lennons ' disgust , " Mrs. Beatle . " When the Beatles traveled from New York to Washington , she wore a black wig so she could get through the crowd . In Washington , she remained alone in her hotel room . In Miami Beach she sunbathed by herself . " Ever since the boys became famous , " says Cynthia , " it 's become more and more difficult for me to see John . " They have an infant son , John , whom the newspapers call , again to their disgust , " Baby Beatle . " When the Lennons have business visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Women , " says John , " should be obscene and not heard . " John is the leader of the Beatles . " We have no leader , " he might argue with some annoyance . " We 're a team , y'know , pull together and all that . " Asa matter of fact , each Beatle has a veto on what the four of them do together . " But it 's John who usually wins out , " says one of their friends . " John is the hippest and the sharpest of the lot . They 've all learned from him . Even their humor , the way they 're always sending people up , they got that from John . " Just 22 , George Harrison is the youngest of the Beatles . " He does n't have the maturity of the others , so he tends to play it a little safe , " says a member of the troupe . " It 's as if he 's the baby of the family . " Being the baby of the family is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bus driser , he is theyoungest of four children . " George was always the one who tried to please , " says his sister , Mrs. Louise Caldwell , the pretty platinum-blond wife of an engineer who lives in the Midwest . " When the fire needed more coal , he would always say , ' Mummy , I 'll do it , let me get the shovel . ' Or when we 'd be going to church , George would polish everyone 's boots . " George plays lead guitar for the Beatles , often with a look of unconcern that seems to reflect a desire to be strumming elsewhere . " Well , " he says , " the songs that Paul and John write , they 're all right , but they 're not the greatest . " His boyhood idols were guitarists Chet Atkins and Duane Eddy , although he recently discovered Andr  --  s Segovia . He listens on the radio to other pop artists from the start of his day , which often begins when road manager Aspinall drags the boys out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He keeps a transistor radio in his hand , even during conversations . He adjusts the volume according to his interest in what is being said . " You have to be very careful of what you say to George . " says disc jockey Murray ( The K ) Kaufman of New York 's WINS , who glad-handed the Beatles when they stepped off the plane in New York and who was George 's roommate when the Beatles traveled to Miami Beach . " You have to be sure that every word means what you want it to mean . He takes what you say very literally . " " George , as a matter of fact , " says manager Brian Epstein , " is the only one The Beatles ho asks questions . He 's the only one who takes an active interest in the Nosiness aspect of the Beatles . He 1% ants to know how i hook them , how the discs are distributed . and exerything that has to do with the financial ? ? orking , s . " George 's ambition , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile of money . " He recalls that in the early days of the group in Liverpool , " we got what would work out to two dollars a night apiece  --  and all the soda ? e could drink . We drank until that stuff came out our ears to make sure c got our money 's worth . " Little more than six months ago one of his major desires was to own a racing car . He now owns a Jaguar . Although by no means the quietest of the Beatles , because none of them really is quiet , George remains the least prominent . At a press conference for fan magazines in New York 's Plaza Hotel , a young woman asked , " Mr. Starr is known for his rings , Mr. McCartney , obviously for his looks , and Mr. Lennon for his wife . What about you , Mr. Harrison ? ' George swallowed a bite of a chicken sandwich , fluttered his long eyelashes in the same manner that Paul often does and answered , " As long as I get an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay anonymous . " These are the Beatles , the four young men who brought with them to America a phenomenon known as Beatlemania . So far , Beatlemania has traveled over two continents . In Stockholm the arrival of the Beatles was greeted with teen-age riots . In Parisanothercongregation held screeching , services at the airport and the Beatles ' performances at the Olympia Theater %%ere sold out for three weeks . In the Beatles ' native Liverpool 60 youngsters collapsed from exposure alter standing all night in a mile-long line of 12,000 waiting to buy tickets to the Beatles ' performance . When a foreman shut off the radio in the middle of a Beatles record at a textile mill in Lancashire . 200 girls went out on strike . While the Beatles toured the United States , three of their singles were in the top six and their albums ranked one and two in the record popularity charts . Beatle wigs were selling at three dollars apiece , high-school boys were combing their forelocks forward and hairdressers Were advertising Beatle cuts for women . Beatle hats , T-shirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach shirts , turtleneck pullovers , nighties. socks and iridescent blue-and-green collarless suits were on the market , and a Beatle motor scooter for children and a Beatlemobile for adults were being readied for production . American bartenders were confounded by a sudden deluge of orders for Scotch and Coke , the Beatles ' favorite drink . " 1 think everyone has gone daft , " says John . Adds Ringo , " Anytime you spell beetle with an ' a ' in it , we get the money . " In 1964 , Beatle-licensed products stand to gross S50 million in America alone . As for the Beatles , their total 1964 income is expected to reach S14 million . It all began in Liverpool , a smog-aired , dockfront city that overlooks the Mersey River . When the Beatles first put their brows together eight years ago , there were an estimated 100 rock-'n ' - roll groups in the city . Today Liverpool is the pop music capital of the British Isles , and what newspapers have come to call " The Mersey Sound " dominates the English hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mersey sound is ? " says one American critic . " It 's 1956 American rock bouncing back at us . " In the beginning the group was called the Quarrymen Skiffle Group , then the Moondogs and then the Moonshiners . John , Paul and George were in the original group ; Ringo Starr joined in 1962 . Hired in 1959 for a job in Hamburg , Germany , the Beatles worked their way up to a wage of S25 a week , and became one of the main attractions along the Reeperhahn , the main street of the city 's red-light district . Swinging in Liverpool " When they got back to Liverpool , that 's when they really started to swing , " says Neil Aspinall . It was then that Brian Epstein discovered them . A delicately mannered young man who once wanted to be a dress designer , Epstein at the time was in charge of the televisionradio-records department of his father 's department-store chain . When several customers began demanding Beatles records , Epstein signed them up , got them a test with Decca Records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electric and Musical Industries Ltd . " They were impressive  --  it was like striking oil , " recalls an E.M.I . official . " 1 remember I gave them hack their first tape and told them , ' If there 's anything you do n't like , let me know . ' And George came right back and said , ' Well , I do n't like your tie for a start . ' " In short order the Beatles had four hits and teen-age mobs began following the Beatles throughout England . It was n't , however , until last October 13 that the Beatles became national heroes . On that night , they played London 's Palladium and several thousand fans mobbed them . They had to be rescued by police . " Well , there were no assassinations that day , " recalls Brian Sommerville . " There were no wars , no invasions , no great crises of state , and the Beatles were the only good story the London dailies had , so they gave it a big display . " In the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E.M.I . release , originally turned down the Beatles ' records . As the craze grew it not only issued them but poured 550,000 into a promotion campaign . " Sure there was a lot of hype , " says Capitol vice president Moyle Gilmore . " But all the hype in the world is n't going to sell a bad product . " Nevertheless , that hype helped stir the interest of thousands of fans who greeted the Beatles at Kennedy Airport . Many thousands more waited for them at New York 's Plaza Hotel . Outside the hotel , stacked up against barricades , the mob chanted , " 141e want the Beatles ! 4'e want the Beatles ! " According to one maid , the Beatles found three girls hiding in their bathtub . Dozens of others climbed the fire exit to the 12th-floor wing in which the Beatle entourage had been ensconced . Still others , with the names and pocketbooks of prominent families , checked in at the hotel and tried to get to the Beatles via the elevators . On the 12th floor the Beatles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for interviews and autographs . One call was from a man who wanted to produce Beatle ashtrays . Another was from a promoter in Hawaii who wanted to hook the Beatles . Telegrams came in by the handful , and boxes loaded with fan mail . We get 12,000 letters a day , " Ringo later said . " Yeah , " added John . " We 're going to answer every one of them . " The road managers , meanwhile , were busy signing the Beatles ' autographs for them , and the room-service waiters kept bringing up tables loaded with Scotch , ice and bottles of Coke . Murray the K also came in , bringing with him the Ronettes , an American recording group of three exotic looking girls . " We net the Beatles in Europe , " one of them said , as if she were singing it . As the Beatles ' stay at the Plaza extended , so did the throngs , Each time the Beatles left the hotel , the mobs would break through police lines in a jumble of lost shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief inspector of police accused the Beatles ' press agents of bringing in teen-agers by the busload . The Beatles , meanwhile , spent their time watching TV , dining at the " 21 " Club , sightseeing from their car , twisting at the Peppermint Lounge , and flirting with bunnies in the Playboy Club . The remainder of the Beatles ' tour of America was more of the same . In Washington , to which the Beatles traveled aboard a private railroad car called The King George , 2 ? 000 teen-age fans mobbed the locked metal gates of Union Station . At their concert in the Coliseum that night the Beatles were showered with flashbulbs , hair rollers , caramels and jelly beans , in some instances a bagful at a time . " M'God ! " Ringo said afterward . " They hurl . They felt just like hailstones . " When they flew to Miami , they were greeted at the airport by a chimpanzee , four bathing beauties , a four-mile-long traffic jam and 7,000 teen-agers , who shattered 23 windows and a plate-glass door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As they were getting off , the wife of the president of National Airlines came aboard with two teen-age girls , but was blocked by Sommerville , who stormed , " No , no , madam ! We can not spend time giving autographs to employees ' families . " At the Deauville Hotel , they were hustled into an elevator . Along the way Ringo recognized a girl singer and pulled her into the elevator . Later a reporter asked Ringo who she was . " She 's just a girl I know , " he said . " What 's her last name ? " the reporter asked . " I do n't know her that well , " Ringo answered . In Miami Beach the Beatles went yachting , swam in a private pool , posed for photographs on the beach while an elderly woman kept walking deliberately in front of the cameras , and then visited the training camp of Cassius Clay . At one point , Sommerville , beaming with gratitude , decided to thank the police sergeant in charge of the Beatles ' security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " Sommerville said warmly , " that Miami Beach has the best police department that money can buy . " Upstairs in Sommerville 's room John was busy answering the telephone , with the calls again coming , one after the other , from as far away as Hawaii . " Hall000 , " he said . " Brian Slummerfield here . . . . Yes luv . . . . Yes luv . . . . No luv , . . G'by luv . " The Beatles flew back to England on February 21 to make their first movie . When they stopped off at Kennedy Airport to change planes for London , they again found several thousand teen-age fans screaming from the observation roof after waiting there for hours . Four girls collapsed . When it was all over , America could relax  --  at least , until the Beatles return this summer .
