 | I do n't Feel Like Me Anymore ! A young wife seeks the answer to modern woman 's most disturbing dilemma : " Can I be a good wife and mother ? and a person in my own right ? " It will take me a long time to forget the gray , cold Sunday afternoon I telephoned my parents in a state of near hysteria . I blurted out all sorts of things that seem silly now but were deadly serious to me then . I hated my husband , I wailed , and my baby was a monster . I was sick to death of washing diapers , and the puppy made messes on the rug , and my husband took the car so I was trapped at home . And I hated my house . Actually , my husband is a wonderful man whom I love , my baby is the cutest ever , I think , and I 'm crazy about my house , a brand-new one and the first we 've owned . What was really bothering me came out next . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know who I am ! " I exploded . As I was later to learn , what was bothering me then ? and still does , to an extent ? was a problem that bothers many women pulled one way by instinct and emotional heritage and driven another by relatively new freedoms and the seemingly incessant demands of the daily world . Another thing that I later learned was that the worries that all but paralyzed me are especially virulent among women who have a better-than-average education or who have worked before marriage . The symptoms of my " disease , " as the problem might be called , as well as the solutions to it , seem always to be found in the details of a woman 's daily life and her relationship with her husband and children . The problem , as it turned out . had its beginnings as far back as our courtship . Peter ? tall . slender , with dark hair and lively blue eyes ? was a cadet at the U.S. Military Academy . and much of our dating was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Point . We were married the week after he was graduated ; I 'd completed my third year at college and . despite a good deal of pressure from my parents , did not finish ? a decision I was later to regret . The wedding was almost picture-perfect ; so was our honeymoon in an isolated cottage on a South Carolina beach : so were the first weeks of our life in the service ? an exciting round of parties and orientation meetings in one of the most picturesque bases in the South . In other words . I came close to living every girl 's romantic dream of courtship @# @# and marriage . I guess my heart expected our life together to go on being a kind of fairy tale , even though my head sternly told me it could n't . My head was right . Peter had transferred from the Army to the Air Force and was learning to fly . He left the house at 5:30 A.M. and did n't come back until 5:00 P.m . While he was gone , I had little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through my days by the framework of school ? classes at a definite hour and , after classes , sharing talk and activities with friends . And there had been the stimulation of new ideas , new thoughts , and the opening doors of new knowledge . Now I had none of these to take me out of myself . I tried going to social gatherings of officers ' wives . At one luncheon the women spent most of the time describing in detail the horrors of childbirth , which made me angry and disgusted because in their midst sat a young girl who was going to have her first baby within a week . Another time , at an afternoon bridge party , one older woman said bitterly , " A college education means nothing for a woman today . It 's just a waste of money . " I objected , not tactfully . " That 's not true ! " I told her . " Even if she does n't have a career , it helps a girl make a better life for her family . helps her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The other woman , whose husband outranked Pete , looked at me scornfully . " I 'll talk to you again in ten years , " she said . Effectively silenced , I decided that the wives were a banal and heartless lot , and I was determined to have no more to do with them . I realize now that a good part of my contempt for the other wives was a leftover intellectual snobbishness from college . With my romantic , girlish dream shattered and my own pride barring contact with others , I retreated into myself . I slept half the day and dreamed away most of the rest . I seldom left the house but sank deeper and deeper into a kind of warm bath of ( Continued on page 196 ) @# @#  | lethargy ? and , of course , quickly became consummately bored . I felt trapped . I had planned to be teacher , but because I had n't finished college , I was n't qualified to teach ; this made me feel useless . Some of the other wives had got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that , either . This lack deepened my feelings of worthlessness . Out of desperation and boredom , more than anything else , I roused myself to action . At college I had been greatly moved by the ideals of the Quakers , partictularly their devotion to serving others and I had worked with children settlement house . Now I found a school for handicapped children and volunteered to help out . One boy there promptly won my heart . His name was Raymond ; he was eight , a spastic , unable to talk or to move his arms and legs except in jerks . ordinated ways . But he was bright and he had humor . The teachers were overworked and did n't have enough to devote to individual children ; but I had the time to spend with Raymond , and he responded immediately . He was being taught to spell by f ing lettered blocks into words . It was obvious he could learn very quickly . @# @# the teachers had been giving him the same words over and over again so that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he grasped them with an . eagerness that was almost pathetic . Then he started to tease me . He 'd take a block and deliberately misplace it and grunt at me urgently in his best attemp ! at speech . By the laughter in his eyes I knew he was doing it deliberately . But the thing that really melted my hears was the excitement and delight he showed every time I came into the room . It made me feel needed and worthy . Then my husband 's course ended , and we were shipped to western Texas for the next phase of his training . As sorry as I was to leave my work with Raymond . the necessities of moving and of finding and furnishing a new home kept my spirits high and my mind occupied . AT THE new base I took part in the wives ' committees . I worked with the family-services committee , which helped newcomers find housing and get acquainted . I also worked with the casualty committee , which helped families when men were killed or injured in a @# @# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , explaining the kind of servAir Force families received at the It was one of the most exciting ngs that had happened to me in nths , but something even more excit happened the same day : I learned w as pregnant . When the baby arrived , it proved to be healthy , blue-eyed , pink-cheeked boy , horn we named Jon , after nobody . Havg the baby helped me find fulfillment many ways . I 'd performed a woman 's maternal function , and I now had some-mg to mother , to nurture , and to give to . And it did more . For the first time in : v life , I felt as if I had done something w ell . I had done my exercises , survived the usual ailments , faced down my fears , and , through natural childbirth , had the baby without missing any of the experience . It had been a difficult thing , and l had done it properly . Thus , in having the baby and later in aring for him , getting up with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his laundry , giving him the gifts of love and laughter , helping him to grow , I found reason for being . But , as it does for -o many women today , the baby an-wered only part of my needs . The other part became more urgent . ONE day I visited an institution for handicapped children . As I went through ' ts rooms and saw the special equipment for teaching the children , talked with the teachers , and watched the children in their struggles to learn , my heart sank when I mentally compared this school with the desperate little two-room school where I had helped out the year before . A picture of Raymond , his bright , humorous eyes smiling , came into my mind , and I thought of how much more quickly he could develop if he could go to this school . As I left the building , I determined that somehow he would . All the way home my mind surged with plans to bring Raymond out West . I could hardly wait to tell Peter all about my idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked at me only occasionally as I told him about the school I had visited and about my plans for little Raymond . But instead of the enthusiastic approval I had expected , my husband responded with a series of " uh-huh , " " well , I do n't know , " and " I doubt it . " After a while I stopped talking . Suddenly all the obstacles I had overlooked in my enthusiasm loomed up before me , and the whole idea seemed preposterous . I sat silently for a few minutes , completely discouraged . Peter 's eyes went back to the TV screen . After a time I got up and walked into the bedroom and closed the door . Lying on my bed , I thought of something I 'd read somewhere about the kinds of personality that went well together in a marriage . " If you are champagne , " the article had said , " what you need is a glass . But not a wet blanket . " Peter 's emotional stability , I thought , was such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lucky I had him to keep me from flying off in all directions . But I wondered why stability , that desirable thing , made you feel so deadened . I had always lived by enthusiasms ? for people , for ideas , for activities . When I was in high school , our house was always alive with people , noise , and laughter . It seemed to me these enthusiasms were what made me feel alive , and the things they had brought about were what had given me a feeling of accomplishment . Now it seemed to me that ever since our marriage Peter , with his more placid and neutral personality , had been smothering my enthusiasms and leaving me feeling frustrated and worthless . THINKING about all this made me resent him , and differences between us grew into open conflict . This reached a climax one day last summer . When I awoke with the baby , it was clear and sunny . Peter was not going to fly , so I suggested we go into the country for a picnic . When Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that familiar wilting sensation in my chest . About an hour later one of the other officers called anal asked Peter if he 'd like to play golf . Peter did ? with enthusiasm . I fumed , but it did no good . He picked up his clubs and drove off in the car . After he left , I had a fine wallow in self-pity . It seemed to me then that he did n't love me and baby Jon because he 'd rather play golf than go on a picnic with his family . He was a kill-joy who would n't let me have any fun . ( Continued ) @# Well , I 'd show him , I told myself . would build a separate life of my own . Jon and I would carry on alone . In ter anger I determined that the next time Peter was away on an extend flight I would n't miss him at all . A week or two later , when he did away and I found I did n't miss him . was frightened . Did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of t end of our marriage ? I recoiled from the idea , in what I can describe only pure terror , and went back to being submissive wife . Later , when I told Peter how I had felt , he was frightened , too . But though this excursion into apartness scared uc both into a renewed realization of our love for each other and our need to be together , it did not ease my deep feeling &; of dissatisfaction . IT WAS shortly after that I made ml tearful phone call home . And it waat about that time that real clarification of my problem and help toward a solution appeared , logically enough , in the person of the minister of the church that Peter and I attended . I talked with the minister about other women who had come to him seeking ways out of situations similar to the one in which I was . As we talked , he brought up a point that held the hope of at least a partial solution . " What women complain about , ' he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage : he never picks up his socks ; he wo n't take me out to dinner any more ; he comes home , flops on the couch , and goes to sleep when I 've been cooped up all day , with nobody to talk to and have been looking forward to being with him . " But what they 're really saying , " he continued , " is that they themselves have lost their feeling of personal worth . When a woman with a trained , active mind is shut away in a house with children and housekeeping chores , the creative , homemaking side of her life may be fulfilled , but the other side ? that is. her desire to be a person in her own right ? is not . Gradually she comes to feel that she has nothing to offer as an individual , and she begins to have nagging feelings of worthlessness . " The minister told me how he had tried o help other troubled wives in his congregation by making a list of their special skills and trying to find ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the community and the individual women . This was one way , he said , that a woman could regain feelings of competence and feelings of usefulness as a person . " Each woman 's specific need , of course , " the minister went on , " is different , and if she ca n't analyze it for herself and find an answer ? and most people ca n't ? she has to have somebody outside to help her . " After our minister had given me the clue , I began to work out in my own mind just what it was I could do to gain fulfillment as an individual and in turn help me make a warm and creative home c Peter and Jon and any other children we might have . decided I have a sincere desire to with handicapped children on a regular basis . This means I will have to -h college ; fortunately , there is a state . university in a city nearby that has a - time study program through which I get the required courses . If I take courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been lackme : in homemaking . This will also proside an outlet for my enthusiasms , which , am convinced , I must be able to express I am to develop into a worthwhile person and become a more effective wife and mother . THERE are many ways in which a woman may seek , and perhaps find , selffulfillment . She might , for example , accomplish this through playing a part successfully in a theater-group production or through organizing a great-books discussion group . But although such act. % hies may help ease a woman 's yearning for self-fulfillment , there is no guarantee that her yearning will be so easily appeased . The answer , I have learned from my own experience , lies in the complicated process of personal growth ? mental , emotional ; and spiritual . Whether this growth takes place at the rate at which it should depends to a great extent on how much a woman is willing to give of herself to gain herself ? on how hard she will work at exercising her mental , emotional , and spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding what she seeks through losing herself in the aspirations of her husband and children . She must make the effort on her own . As Anne Morrow Lindbergh wrote in her memorable book , Gift from the Sea , " woman must learn to stand alone . She must learn not to depend on another , nor to feel she must prove her strength by competing with another ... . She must become whole . " THE END @# @# I 11 Gleam aluminum I ware .
