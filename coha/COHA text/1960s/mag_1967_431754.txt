 | WE HAD FLOWN northeastward for three hours through the star-blazed Siberian night . Since we had left Irkutsk , not a speck of light had pierced the darkness below . We might have been over an ocean , for all the signs of life under our wings . Then the plane glided earthward out of the black crystal sky , touched wheels to an ice-white runway , and rolled to a stop in front of the Yakutsk terminal . I stepped out into air as still as ice but colder than any ice I had ever known . The temperature , our captain had  | told us , stood at 58 ? below zero Fahrenheit . And yet , amazingly , this breath-catching , face-burning , subarctic atmosphere was thick with fog . Nowhere in nature does fog exist at temperatures far below freezing .

Here , a waiting room like others of its kind everywhere in the world contained a welcome warmth and a sizable number of cheerful , baggageless young men and women who were obviously not passengers . Through my guide and interpreter , Yevgeniy Ruzhnikov ( left ) , I asked the airport receptionist about them . " There is no love on the streets of Yakutsk when the winter cold is upon us .

Only yesterday I had been in Moscow , now six time zones away. * Before that I had traversed a fifth of the world in the long flight from Washington , D. C. On an earlier Siberian journey my wife and I had circled the globe to visit four towns on the Trans-Siberian Railroad that were officially " open " to foreign tourists .

And it had not been easy travel , for many barriers impede even supervised journeys in Russia . Yet a guided tour was the only way to get a good look at a land almost unknown to the Western World , a land as big as the United States and Mexico combined . Siberian Breakfast : " Eyes " Straight Up Yakutsk , now asleep around me in the frozen night , had been founded in 1632 as a fur-trading outpost of the old tsarist empire . Siberia ? or Sibir , as Russians know it ? was not a country then but a frontier region , and so it remains . Russians think of it much as Americans used to think of their West . But Russian frontierland , like its American counterpart before it , is being infiltrated by modernity . Tomorrow 's techniques modify the wilderness . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old traders ' camp . The Siberian breakfast is comfortingly similar to the American ? toast , tea , sausage , and eggs .

" Mine fixed me with an orange stare that momentarily stayed my upraised fork . I like my eggs scrambled , but I found no scrambled eggs in Siberia . At daybreak ? after nine o'clock ? Ruzhnikov and I set out for an interview with the mayor . Fur-hatted Yakuts hurried along the sidewalks , mittens to their faces . Buses , trucks , cars , and horse-drawn sledges filled the street with continuous traffic , reminding me that Yakutsk is a busy city of 89,000 and growing by the week . As we left the center of town , stucco buildings gave way to unpainted wooden ones with low-pitched roofs ( snowfall is light in this ( Continued on page 308 ) *For other accounts of travel in Russia , see in the NATIONAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1966 , and " Firsthand Look at the Soviet Union , " September , 1959 , both by Thomas T.

And everywhere the weird blue habitation fog softened the scene , blurring every detail , dimming every color . " Watch your nose ! " shouted a passerby . Ruzhnikov stared at me in alarm . " Your nose is white ! " he cried . " Rub it ! It is freezing ! " " Impossible , " I told him , laughing . " We 're only five minutes from the hotel . " Then I noticed that my nostrils were clogged with ice and that every breath caused a stinging in my chest . Startled , I rubbed with a will . Circulation and color came back .

F. temperature advanced the film to take another ? and the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried on , we saw old log homes , weathered , unpainted , with fancy carving and fretwork around the windows and doors ( page 312 ) , many of them tilted at angles so odd as to suggest that their builders had been full of vodka . But in fact , Ruzhnikov explained , it was because they were built on ground that was full of frost . Mayor Mikhail Semenov , in the welcome warmth of his office , developed this frosty theme further . Like all Yakuts , he was endlessly concerned with the weather . Luxurious coat assures this silver fox a pampered life at Oymyakon 's state animal farm ? until skinning time . Mostly black , the variety takes its name from a sprinkling of silver-tipped hairs . Its highly prized pelt probably will be shipped abroad , where furs earn the U.S.S.R. valuable foreign exchange .

Face-framing fur sets off the beauty of a young mother and child in Irkutsk , crossroads of Siberia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was even more difficult than keeping my nose alive . My camera hung inside my parka , and when I breathed down , it frosted up . If I blew my breath up , my glasses became white disks about as transparent as a pair of clamshells . To regain even a vestige of vision , I had to remove my down-filled mittens , then my knit gloves , then ? wearing only my silk undergloves ? pinch the middle of each lens to defrost a small spot in its center . By the time I was ready , my fingers were numb . But I could still raise my camera , holding my breath so as not to obscure the viewfinder , and take a picture . Triumphant , I " We have an eight-month-long winter , 3 miles south of the Arctic Circle , " he told " with temperatures often reaching - 76 ' The earth is frozen solid here to a depth about 1,000 feet .

And , during the brief time that the river is open , our supplies are brought in by barge . " The mayor went on to talk about new construction ? one of the most conspicuous activities in Yakutsk and , for that matter , everywhere in Siberia . Once a discussion turns to building , of course , it immediately returns to the subject of the permanently frozen ground , or permafrost . " When we put up a new building now , " the mayor said , " we put it on piles . At the moment we are building a seven-story hotel and many apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we worried about the weather , we could work only four months of the year . But why do n't you have a look at our construction methods yourselves ? " Habitation Fog Ends at City Limits Vladimir Dynin , construction director of the Yakutsk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic , took us in his jeep to an apartment house being erected , where bundled-up men and women were laying bricks in spite of the 50-below-zero temperature . " The mortar is heated , " he told us , " but if the weather gets much colder , the crane that lifts the mortar wo n't operate properly . That stops us . " I began to take pictures of the people at work . To my chagrin , I soon had to give up . This time the film held up , but my fingers did not . ( The skin peeled off them ten days later . ) I was forced to put my heavy mittens back on , while smiling women , who sensibly had kept their mittens on , continued to lay bricks . As we left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits , the fog suddenly ended and we emerged into a bright , crisp day , full of sunshine . We had escaped at last from the frozen exhalations of Yakutsk . On the level land along the river , Dynin showed us a dozen huge spikes sticking out of the ground ( right ) . " These are reinforced concrete piles . We use steam jets to thaw the permafrost and then , when the soil is mushy , we sink a pile down 23 feet . When the soil refreezes , the pile becomes part of the frozen ground . The buildings to be supported by the piles will be set six to eight feet above the ground , as if they were on stilts . The cold air will circulate under them and prevent their heat from melting the permafrost . " Curious about this phenomenon of the literally frozen north , we went to Yakutsk 's Permafrost Institute . Its director , Pavel Melnikov , peered over the top of his glasses and talked about the problems frost causes . " Even in summer permafrost affects us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface ca n't drain down , so in the warm season there are bogs over much of Siberia . Mosquitoes breed in them by the billions . " But there are great natural resources ? oil , natural gas , gold , tin , coal , black mica , and diamonds ? in the permafrost , wealth for the taking , but in difficult situations that stimulate ingenious minds . " For instance , we hope to pipe natural gas to Yakutsk and other communities ? without pipes ! We will attempt  | to send it through tunnels in the permafrost . When we get gas , we will raise vegetables in big gas-heated hothouses . " Director Melnikov took us about 50 feet down into the institute 's experimental cave . The floor crunched as we walked through this permanent natural deep freeze , the walls and ceilings of which were covered with frost . Its tunnels , cut through the frozen earth , needed no shoring ( page 300 ) . Layer of Ice Keeps Water From Freezing The director then spoke of mining gold in the frozen ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold . It is a two-year operation . The first year we melt the surface , sometimes by solar energy . The area is then flooded with water , which freezes down to about seven feet . Insulated by this top layer of ice , the subsurface water continues the thawing during the winter . Early in March dredges break through the ice and the mining begins . " From the cave our way led through the fog again to the office of the president of this largest of the Soviet Union 's autonomous republics . In the Yakutsk A.S.S.R. , as in others that reflect ethnic divisions , the people take pride in their racial and linguistic individuality . Herself a proud Yakut , Madame President Aleksandra Ovchinnikova was born of poor . illiterate cattle breeders in the wilderness west of Yakutsk . She completed studies at a technical school , worked as an engineer , took her higher education by correspondence , and finally graduated in history ( page 328 ) . Now 52 , she told me with obvious pride , " My son is a civil engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Ovchinnikova descends from one of the numerous nomad tribes that roamed Siberia before the tsarist Russians conquered the land and that gave the city of Yakutsk and the Yakutsk A.S.S.R. their names .

" Passengers remained bundled throughout the flight . Fluffy snowsuit prepares a tyke for frigid Oymyakon 's outdoors . His one-piece garment traps a layer of insulating air .

Soviet scholars have even devised alphabets for tribal languages and have put down tribal traditions in writing . Some schools teach Yakut , but Russian is used in the higher grades because more textbooks are available in that language . Siberia Respects Its Nomadic Heritage " We are trying to preserve the nomadic culture , " said Mrs. Ovchinnikova . " Reindeer must still be herded by nomads , and there are many herds in our republic . The parts of the native costume that are useful are also being saved . Native reindeer-skin boots and parkas are used everywhere in this region because they are practical . " But our most importait work is directed toward the future . We have in mind a  | tremendous hydroelectric development on the Lena . Our scientists say the huge reservoirs created for that purpose may even affect the local climate . " Work has also begun on the covered city of Aykhal , a series of interconnected buildings that will enable everyone to stay indoors all winter .

Spirt ? spirits ? a drink that is 96 percent alcohol , was also served . This potent beverage , which does n't freeze as easily as vodka , is a basic element of Siberian hospitality . As the waiter poured my drink , he asked Ruzhnikov , " Does the American need water in his spirits ? " " But of course , " said my considerate guide , " or he 'll be in flames . " We went to bed early that night since we had to rise at three in the morning to catch a plane to the real north . Though we arrived at the airport at four in the morning , we could n't take off until noon because of " human-habitation fog . " When we finally boarded the airplane , the metal fittings inside the cabin were as icy as the inside of a refrigerator in need of defrosting .

Warm Welcome to the " Pole of Cold " The flight took us over low mountains and hills and forested valleys , all part of the monotonous taiga , boggy woodland , covering the heart of Siberia . At last , at three in the afternoon , just as the setting sun spread a warm glow across the cold land , we came down at Oymyakon , the coldest town in the world . Home of 3,500 people , Oymyakon exists primarily to support an immense animal farm . It is the only community in the world where a temperature of - 96 ? F. has been recorded .

" If we were to mind the mercury , schools would be closed half the winter . " Then he went on to explain the farm 's operation . " Oymyakon is basically a breeding station for reindeer , horses , a few cows , and silver foxes page 30S . We butcher the reindeer and horses for their meat , and feed the scraps to the foxes . We also have hunters and trappe working for us in the taiga . " I asked if I could visit the reindeer he and the trappers .

" I inquired . " I do n't know . It has to come from Khandyga ? 225 miles away . I 'll see what I can do . " A telegram went off to Aeroflot , which does all nonmilitary flying in the Soviet Union . In several hours we had our reply : " Helicopter will be in Oymyakon tomorrow morning . User will pay by the hour . " I could hardly believe it . It was too easy . Sure enough , the next morning the helicopter arrived , and with the director standing between the two pilots , pointing the way , we were off . We flew up one valley and down another , skimming over magnificent ridges topped with frost-covered evergreens . The country reminded me of northern Minnesota . After an hour I began to get a little uneasy . On the frozen lakes and rivers there were many tracks that could only have been made by a large herd , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun was nearly down . We gave up the search and landed again at Oymyakon . I stepped out into a crowd of about a hundred children who had come to  | see the helicopter and the American ( page 304 ) . The village chairman , Yegor Keremyasov , invited us to eat . Wending our way from the helicopter to the stolovaya ? the restaurant ? I felt like the Pied Piper of the Pole of Cold . All the children were right behind me . I had n't expected gourmet food in Siberia , and I found none . But I did find substantial , filling , and tasty fare . On this occasion the meal consisted of roast ribs of young horse , rice , gravy , and beef tongue . It was delicious . Raw Fish Served With Frozen Cream Later that night I was invited to the home of Maria Krivoshapkina , a milkmaid who also sews boots out of reindeer hide . Her house was the traditional log building , but plastered both inside and out against the wind . She offered us an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reindeer , and chokhon , a cheeselike frozen cream . With spirits , of course . Stroganina once was considered a health food . Its preparation was simple : The cook smashed a frozen fish into pieces and served it . Today , eaten as a delicacy , it is offered in thin , tooth-cracking strips , seasoned with red pepper , salt , and mustard . Eating stroganina is like swallowing fish-flavored ice that turns into a raw oyster on its way down . During the dinner I picked up odd bits of information about local food and drink . Frozen blocks of milk are transported in baskets during the winter . Old Yakuts like to eat frozen marrow from reindeer bones . In summer , a refreshing , nutritious , and slightly intoxicating beverage called kumiss is brewed from mare 's milk and drunk in great quantities from large wooden goblets called chorons ( page 334 ) . Oymyakon did finally produce a reading of - 69 ? F. , a fact that I verified with my own thermometer . But , fascinating as the visit had been , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irkutsk . Wherever I wanted to go in Siberia , it appeared , I had to leave from Irkutsk to get there . I went through the city eight times . In this busy " Chicago " of Siberia , more than 400,000 residents enjoy a lively cultural life , with a concert hall , a circus , and theaters . Irkutsk prides itself on a university , several technical institutes , and modern factories . Neon signs flash along its streets , most of which are paved . One night Ruzhnikov and I went to see a traveling comedy troupe from Moscow . The hall was jammed with students and workers . I needed no Russian to understand the spoof on red tape , a skit that had the audience  | shaking with laughter as a pompous bureaucrat kept pulling out his rubber stamp , blowing on it with a loud " Whoo ! " and slamming it down on a sheet of paper . I laughed helplessly as I thought of my own experiences with some Russian officials . Public Water Taps Serve Many In contrast to all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just two blocks from the city square and the modern government buildings . The sheltered faucet , one of many in town , draws an endless procession of women , who fill metal buckets and carry them home on the ends of poles balanced on their shoulders . A number of Irkutsk 's handsome old wooden buildings were still in use , but some resi- dents objected when I photographed them . They wanted me to take pictures of the monotonous rows of prefabricated concrete apartments growing up all over the city . " The old things are dead to us , " they told me . Today 's modern town began in 1652 as a winter outpost for the collection of tribute , payable in furs , which the tribes were forced to deliver to agents of the tsars . This tax had been levied on the indigenous Siberians ever since Cossack troops led by Yermak Timofeyevich defeated the Tatar ruler of Siberia in 1582 , opening Siberia for expansion of the Russian Empire .

Fed by the great lake , the swift-flowing river never freezes over here nor does it vary in volume . Fresh-water Seals in a Mile-deep Lake In summer the Angara served as an excellent highway for transport of pelts northward and supplies southward to the city . Irkutsk became a key station on the Trans-Siberian Railroad , and the last major stop in the U.S.S.R. on the way to strategic Mongolia. * One day Ruzhnikov and I drove the short distance to Lake Baykal , the world 's only mile-deep lake . Stretching 420 miles long , and up to 46 miles wide , it contains nearly as much fresh water as all the Great Lakes combined ? water pure as rain and so clear that one can see bottom 100 feet down . More than 300 rivers and streams flow into Baykal , but only the Angara flows out ( pages 316-17 ) .

The lake had frozen solid to a depth of five feet , but the Angara , clear of ice , flowed on . Going down to the river , we watched as ducks flew up to the edge of the ice and then floated back downstream in the fast current . Out on the ice , against a backdrop of snowcovered mountains , a group of young boys played vigorous hockey ( page 318 ) . Lone skaters darted along , miles out , jumping from one snow-free spot to another . Between drifts the ice glistened , so pure it looked like plate glass . It was no surprise to learn that this unique and beautiful area may become the Soviet Union 's first national park .

As the sun went down in a pink-and-blue evening , the timbermen took me out on the ice for a picnic . Fish and boiled eggs were set out on the slick surface , and we drank numerous toasts in " Baykal water " ? vodka , of course . I was urged to return in summer , and by now I realized that another trip in the opposite season would be necessary if I were to present a balanced picture of this land of extremes . In Moscow the following June I asked for official permission to visit Tiksi , near the delta where the Lena River enters the Arctic Ocean , and to take a ship from there during the few months when the " Northeast Passage " ? the route that links European Russia and Siberia 's scattered ports ? is ice-free and navigable .

Few journalists from the West ever got there to set the facts straight ; few get there today . By now I knew a bit about the country and understood better why exploring it was so difficult . Secrecy is not , I think , the only reason for travel restrictions .

The Soviets do n't want anyone , particularly Americans , to see anything substandard in their country . In Siberia in Summer , Day May Last All Night Fortunately I was able to revisit Yakutsk in summer and to look in on three other remote communities , including Verkhoyansk ? another animal farm , farther north but not as cold as Oymyakon . Yevgeniy Ruzhnikov came along again as guide and interpreter . After the inevitable stop at Irkutsk , and another at Yakutsk , we crossed the broad Lena River , now full of barges and ships taking advantage of its short open season . Four hundred miles farther north we touched down at Verkhoyansk ( map , pages 304-5 ) . Wrapped in an old skirt of wooden houses , Yakutsk cloaks its heart with pastel-hued modernity .

Today , like Oymyakon , it lives by horse , cattle , and fox farming and by the breeding of half-wild reindeer . Strangers find Verkhoyansk a disorienting place . In June the sun does not disappear behind the mountains until 11:30 at night and reappears at 1 a.m . We went to a movie , which ended at 10:30 p.m. , and came out with the crowd into bright sunlight . Settlers from more southern latitudes find it difficult to get used to these nightless summers and dayless winters . The government even conducts research to find out how the strange seasons affect the human body . My own observation is that people figuratively hibernate in winter ( the streets are empty at 6 p.m. ) and live fully , almost without sleep , during the summer nights . To me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disturbing element . Like most provincial Soviet towns , Verkhoyansk has radio loudspeakers set around the central area , blaring local programs or broadcasts from Radio Moscow at all hours . I found it troubling to hear a voice shout " good morning " at two in the afternoon . Many clocks and most travel schedules keep Moscow time , seven zones away . Capitalist Food for Communist Mosquitoes One hot day the village music teacher asked if we would like to go swimming . " Is n't the water too cold ? " I asked . " Oh , the river is too cold , but there is a very pleasant lake near the airport . " The temperature had climbed above 90 ? , high enough to warrant a swim north of the Arctic Circle . I wore side-lacing Russian bikini-style trunks , but the crowd at the beach quickly spotted me as a stranger because of my six-foottwo-inch height and my cameras . Later , as I sat in the sun with my friends , horseflies and persistent mosquitoes from the bogs of the taiga began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera bag and began to spray myself with the aerosol can .

" At the end of the three days allotted me in Verkhoyansk , Ruzhnikov and I boarded an elderly aircraft containing an assortment of herdsmen and scientists , supplies and instruments , and headed southwest across the meandering Yana River ( pages 324-5 . ) At Yakutsk , in the same hotel where I had  | spent my first Siberian winter night , I was kept awake until after midnight by singers who held forth under the windows . Dozing at last , I was awakened at 4 a.m. by the hot sun streaming into the room . Treeless Yakutsk in summer becomes a vista of dust and mud , with building cranes and new construction everywhere . I found a pleasant contrast to the dreary , bustling scene in the house of Semen Pesterov , a sculptor whose medium is the ivory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His carvings , in classic Yakut style , represent reindeer and other animals native to the region ( page 301 ) . Yakuts Dance Around Tethered Horse A Yakutsk official invited us to a summer festival ? the national holiday called Ysyakh ? based on ancient tradition ( below and two following pages ) . We traveled to the collective farm of Tyungyulyu , two hours upstream  | from the city by boat and two more crosscountry by jeep . Hundreds of people had gathered in the village . Ceremonies began with speeches . Then , ) fficial business concluded , the picnic began ? a feast of boiled beef and kumiss . Next came a " Hitching Post " dance . Men and women formed a circle around a tethered horse and chanted a song that had only two notes . It sounded like a yodel . I was told that - 'le improvised words always celebrated the Adding a new touch to tradition , a collective farm at Tyungyulyu opens Ysyakh , a Yakut national festival .

None of the dancers could account for the horse . The explanation must lie deep in a past that predates Yakut written history . The festival continued with more dancing , some foot races , and , well on toward midnight , a horse race . One Sunday morning Ruzhnikov arranged an outing from Yakutsk aboard a vessel on the Lena River . All Siberia seemed sunny and warm when we boarded the Mekhanik Kulibin . As we pulled away from the dock , a youthful seven-piece orchestra played modern Russian music , generally off key . With Ruzhnikov as interpreter , I got into a conversation with an automobile mechanic named Aleksandr . While we picnicked aboard , Aleksandr told me tales about bears . Bear stories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siberian conversation as talk about the weather . Bad Luck to Harm a " Little Mike " Bears seem of great sentimental concern to Russians , who invariably name them Myshka , or " Little Mike . " Aleksandr told me that Yakuts will not kill a bear unless absolutely necessary . If they do , they believe , something bad is likely to happen . He knew of a man who shot a bear as it slept harmlessly on a floating piece of ice . Shortly thereafter , the man 's son drowned close by . I had decided that , after Yakutsk , I would go back to Khabarovsk , an industrial city of 402,000 people at the confluence of the Amur and Ussuri Rivers , only 35 miles from the Chinese border . I had been there once before with my wife Lee , but as tourists we had seen little of that Far Eastern city . We had traveled there on the famous Trans-Siberian Railroad , coming in from the eastern seaport of Nakhodka ( following pages ) , where we had first set foot on Siberian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a historic engineering achievement , was begun in 1891 and completed 12 years later ? except for a section around Lake Baykal . At first only a single track , laid in a hurry , it required constant repair . During the winter , the tracks ran over Baykal 's thick covering of ice ; in summer , trains crossed the lake on ferries . This slender thread soon helped transform Siberia . It had been summer when I traveled the strategic line with Lee , and the hills and fields , the numerous small farms , looked lush and green as they streamed past our windows in an unchanging panorama .  | In the Russian manner , we had shared our compartment for four with strangers . Our companions had been agreeable , however , and the bunks quite comfortable . In addition to de luxe accommodations like ours , the train offered a second class , with slightly harder bunks , and a third class in which the entire car was open and became , in effect , a dormitory . I made several friends by taking their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the dining car , which had excellent food , a group of Russian servicemen became so friendly that I had trouble getting away from the typical vodka hospitality . Tigers Roam Where Reindeer Graze Returning to Khabarovsk now as a reporter , I had to go thousands of miles out of the way and approach by jet plane -- -from Irkutsk , of course . Ruzhnikov and I made our first call on the director of the natural history museum , Vsevolod Sysoyee , a delightful , elflike man with pepper-and-salt beard . " The interesting thing here , " he said , " is the existence , among our far-northern species , of plants and animals that people think of as being almost . tropical . Lush vines wrap our birches , and tigers live in the same forests as reindeer . " The summer is warm and humid , as in the northern jungles of the Himalayas . But winter is severe ; a cold , dry wind 338 National Geograc  | blows in from the north . In the Amur River , near here , you can catch beluga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes reach a length of 15 feet , and one has been known to yield two barrels of black caviar . " The director closed our interview by quoting a statement made by Prince Alexander Nevski as this medieval Russian hero and saint set free German knights taken prisoner after they had invaded Russia . " Go now , " he is supposed to have said , " and tell everybody to come to our country as guests without any fear . But he who comes with a sword will perish of a sword . " My host concluded , " I hope this helps you grasp the Russian nature . We are two big countries , your nation and mine . If we do not keep the peace , our descendants will curse us . " Gratitude Undimmed by Two Decades To see something of the impact of the modern world on Khabarovsk , I visited a furniture factory . All designs executed here , its chief engineer explained , were received from a bureau in Moscow . As he showed me through the place , a rosy-cheeked woman rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translated as she spoke rapidly in Russian : " Please excuse me , " she said . " I heard there was an American in the factory and I just want to express my thankfulness to the American troops who liberated me from Germany in 1945 .

Your soldiers rescued me from a burning barracks at a forced-labor camp in Germany . My name is Olga . Please pass on my best regards to the former soldiers who liberated me and gave me such good care for the six months I was in a hospital . " Later on that same hot July day , I joined swimmers at the edge of the slow-flowing Amur River . The place was crowded . Siberians all seem to be great swimmers and sun worshipers , perhaps because their summer season is so short . I carried a small waterproof camera around my neck and swam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ducked in and out of the water . I returned to the shore near a group of very pretty girls who were pushing each other into the river . Suddenly I found myself surrounded by the giggling group . With a chanted count of " raz , dva , tri , " I , too , was sent splashing . I had an invitation to return to the timber camp beside Lake Baykal where I had concluded my winter visit . A jet plane and a new hydrofoil speedboat got me there swiftly and comfortably . It was a beautiful afternoon . Clear , almost glassy water reflected the rugged shoreline . I remarked on its serenity . " Do n't let it fool you , " said the hydrofoil skipper . " Storms come up very quickly on " Your soldiers rescued me , " a woman named Olga recalls emotionally on meeting the author .

" The next morning we toured the lumbermen 's village . It consisted of new individual homes , neatly fenced , with a huge stack of split firewood beside each . Children of the nursery school walked down Peace Street on their way to a nature hike ( page 322 ) . A motorcycle left a cloud of dust on Baykal Avenue , and a horse-drawn wagon turned into Tschai kovsky Street . We drove on to the forest . There we stopped to watch Aleksan Moskovskikh , a wiry lumberjack , cutti trees with his chain saw . I asked how man days he worked . " Seven hours a day for five days and s hours on Saturday , " he said . " On the seven day I 'm a devoted fisherman .

I asked Moskovskikh why he had come to Siberia . " I was born here , " he explained . " But you , too , seem fond of Siberia . " " I 've met fine people here , " I replied . " And that is another answer to your question . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like hunting and fishing as much as I do , this place is as close to heaven as you are likely to get . I 'm proud to be a Siberian . " On the boat back to Irkutsk next day I heard of a disturbing development that may affect Lake Baykal . The crystal lake is in great danger of being polluted . Two large pulp and paper plants , now under construction , propose to dump their noxious wastes into it . A controversy was raging ; many people demanded that the wastes be diverted to the Angara River . Conservationists and economic planners argued bitterly . So far , the question is unresolved . Three hundred miles northwest of Irkutsk lies the brand-new town of Bratsk , grown up on the Angara River around the world 's largest hydroelectric plant ( next pages ) . We flew there through E Ns rain and fog and were met by a guide who spoke excellent English and had a head full of facts . " The dam can generate twice the electricity of your Grand Coulee , " he informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bratsk area , and the average age of adults is under 30 . Building was difficult here because the ground is frozen six months of the year . People at first lived in tents . There was a terrible mosquito problem until the dam was completed and the lake began to form , covering the insects ' swampy breeding grounds . " I found myself liking Bratsk . I could see and sense its pioneering spirit . New flats and stores were rising out of seas of mud . In one area I saw thirty apartment buildings in various stages of construction . In another were a number of log and wooden homes , many built by the owners themselves ( page 325 ) .  | These had no running water or sewer system and depended on wood for heat . " Personally , " the guide said , " I prefer an apartment where I have to pay only 5 percent of my salary ? for everything . " Bratsk , like other isolated frontier areas in Siberia , he said , offers high salaries to workers who will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet wage and ultimately as much as 50 percent . The Angara sends a uniform , year-round flow into the dam . To take advantage of this assured volume of water , four more dams are planned farther downstream . The Russians claim that when these are completed , the river will produce one-third as much hydroelectric power as all the present installations in the United States . In its first application , the dam powered an aluminum plant . Now a large wood-products plant is in production . Since 1955 , Bratsk has progressed from outpost to thriving factory center . Science Town Plans Russia 's Tomorrow If Bratsk symbolizes Siberia 's leap into the future , Novosibirsk , Russia 's largest city east of the Urals , may be called the place where the future has already arrived . We went to this last stop of my Siberian tour by train , an express that would roll on to Moscow . Novosibirsk was founded where the TransSiberian tracks bridge the Ob ' River . Many factories moved there for safety during World War II , and the town boomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the jewel of Novosibirsk actually lies 25 miles out of town on the shores of a reservoir called the Ob ' Sea . This is Akademgorodok , generally referred to in English as Science Town . It looks nothing at all like other communities in Siberia . Andrei Trofimuk , deputy director of the entire development , talked to us : " This city was only an idea on paper in 1957 , " he said . " Now we have the Siberian Department of the Academy of Sciences and twenty separate scientific establishments concerned with nuclear physics , chemistry , biology , geology , and economics . The city resulted from the need to realize the potential of Siberia ? its rivers , forests , and the resources under the ground . " I toured the nuclear physics laboratories with one of the chief scientists , a humorous , softspoken man who talked with enthusiasm of his early years with Igor Kurchatov , who helped develop the Soviet nuclear bomb . " I consider nuclear physics the greatest achievement of contemporary science , " he told me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge for peace . "  | As we peered into a particle accelerator , he continued : " The colliding electrons and positrons here generate energy that , particle for particle , is several thousand times greater than that of the H-bomb . New fuels can be developed that will be a billion times hotter than contemporary fuels . With such fuels , man can go to faraway planets . Not many people realize how close we are to such energy . " " Does n't all this power you are unleashing frighten you ? " I asked . " Why should a man be frightened by being armed with a rifle in the jungle ? For man , nature is the jungle and this energy is our rifle . " The man and the institute were enormously impressive , but as we walked through a laboratory , I noticed that the Russians , like me , have still not solved the problem of how to make the linoleum lie flat . Favored Classes in a Classless Society It has been suggested that a new ruling class exists in the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in terms of privilege , are the scientists . Top scientists at Science Town can , if they wish , occupy private homes on big plots in the forest , served by quiet , winding streets . A young scientist who lived with his wife in one of these houses took us for a ride on the Ob ' Sea in his new boat ( opposite ) . His was one of four or five hundred boats tied up at the local marina . While we cruised , he told me why he had come to Siberia . " Science Town is not crowded like Moscow , and there are many opportunities here . I go abroad once or twice a year and have been to most of the European countries and to Canada . It 's not far by plane to Moscow ; I go there on business seven or eight times a year . I probably see more first-night performances now than when I lived in Moscow . " But , most important , I came here because of the challenge of my work . In a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later , at the end of my Siberian travels , I sat in the modern airport in Novosibirsk . As I waited for the Moscow plane , I recalled a wonderful exile song that I had heard one night at the timber camp , sung by a lumberman , grandson of an exile . He had a deep , rich voice and steel teeth that glinted in the firelight . I had asked for a translation , and now I took it out of my pocket and read : Glorious Sea ? Sacred Baykal , Glorious ship ? barrel of fish . Hey , wind , stir up the wave , We do n't have far to sail , good fellow . Long I carried heavy chains , Long I roamed the Akatuy mountains . An old comrade helped me escape , I was born anew .... So it may be , I think , with Siberia itself .
