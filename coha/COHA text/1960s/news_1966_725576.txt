txt Cape Kennedy , Fla. , June 4-Budgeting fuel and getting as much rest as possible , Astronauts Thomas P. Stafford and Eugene A. Cernan today prepared again for a complex space walk . " Thanks for the rest , " Cernen told ground control , " it sure helps . " Cernan , 32 , a native of Chicago , is now scheduled to open the hatch of his Gemini 9 spacecraft at 10:10 a. m. tomorrow and begin a jet-assisted space walk planned to last two and one-half hours . Asks for Delay M 7:10 p. m . Stafford and Cernan began a 10 ? hour sleep period and Gemini control said there would be no further communication during the night . Command Pilot Stafford had asked the ground for permission to delay the walk one day simply because he and Cernan were " bushed . " William Schneider , mission director , said in praising the astronauts : " It is really amazing that we have been able to demonstrate a triple rendezvous in a period of less than 24 hours . " They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex maneuver this morning . " " Done to Perfection " He referred to the Gemini coming down to within a few feet of the target vehicle in a type of rendezvous that might have to be used in a lunar flight . Space officials said the rendezvous  --  the third and last for the mission  --  was done to perfection , using some equipment that was acting in an unexplained , balky fashion . The astronauts were told that their on-board fuel gauges were not working properly , but that ground control still could determine accurately that enough was left for completion of the mission . Tape Recorder Problem A tape recorder on the Gemini also was malfunctioning , according to Al Chop , a communicator , and the astronauts were told to shut it off and use it only for the space walk and reentry phase of flight . The recorder is needed tomorrow to store data from a miniature spaceship called an astronaut maneuvering unit . The unit looks like an oversized scout back pack  --  with arms and controls to allow Cernan to control its directions with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in direct contact with Cernen during the two and a half hour walk . Physicians have warned Stafford to watch Cernan closely for any signs of fatigue or excessive heart rates during the walk in the frictionless void of space . Dr. Charles Berry , chief astronaut physician , said it is possible that many of the walk assignments might have to be called off if Cernan 's rates jump too high . Schneider ruled out any possibility of other rendezvous attempts during the remainder of the three-day mission . The flight is supposed to continue for a total of 46 revolutions altho the exact landing site for Monday has not yet been selected . Fuel Supply Low Cernan might also have attempted to cut the shroud off the target docking cone so the Gemini could park inside , but the fuel supply got so low that the astronauts could no longer afford to fly in formation . Ground control tried to remove the shroud from the target by sending radio commands that shook it while the astronauts took close - up photographs . When that failed , the astronauts stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an orbit 185 miles above the earth . The Gemini then moved about 8 miles farther away on each 93 minute orbit of the earth . Three Previous Delays The astronauts took off from here yesterday at 8:39 a. m . The target vehicle had been fired into orbit on Wednesday  --  the day Cernan and Stafford wanted to get off after three previous delays . The target still in space is a substitute for a $10,000,000 Agena that fell into the sea May 17 when its booster Atlas rocket failed to work properly . The substitute target 's failure'to shuck the shroud caused the loss of a docking experiment , and also the use of much more energy on the part of the astronauts . While most of the nation slept , Stafford and Cernan were awake in the wee hours , performing systems checks  --  but also getting a few baseball scores from ground control . They sounded as professionally sharp reading instrument values as in early flight , and even quipped to Astronaut Neil Armstrong over the radio , " How are things in Houston this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . STAFFORD  --  I can imagine . You guys keep some terrible hours down there . " I 'm Double Loser " ARMSTRONG  --  Yeah , you do too . The Astros lost last night to Pittsburgh , 7 to 2 . STAFFORD  --  Well , I 'm a double loser . ARMSTRONG  --  You 've got to expect a few losses . An apparent reference to loss of docking maneuvers in the flight caused by a shroud covering the docking cone of the target adapter . We 've just been talking to Dive Scott and Jim astronauts of previous Gemini missions at some length ; they 've been climbing around a shroud out at Douglas company that was one of the contractors for the last few hours and they advise the outside is no problem . ' Edges and Things ' The inside may turn out to be a problem . There are quite a bit of sharp edges and things on the inside , cotter keys and one thing or another . Stafford also told Armstrong , who took a space flight March 16 , that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . ARMSTRONG - It looks all 0 . K. on the ground to us , too . STAFFORD  --  O. K. I do n't know what . the glich was . Also we changed cords there had been some minor power problems yesterday with camera equipment and I have changed utility cords where I 've got my camera and optical sight . Going O. K. over here . The astronauts reported at 3:21 a , m. that by that time they had eaten four meals of dehydrated food and consumed 110 ounces of water . The ground asked for a sleep report , and the answers came back : " Eight hours of dozing . " They went thru some maneuvers to put them in another egg-shaped orbit around the earth before beginning their rendezvous approach to the target from above . Of the final rendezvous as the Gemini 9 was about 20 miles from the target ship and closing , Stafford said , " From the rendezvous from above , we 've reflected moonlight on the target . " Takes About an Hour In the first simulation of rendezvous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close that they could see and steer without assistance fr o m complicated electronic equipment . " Finally have a little spot down there , " Stafford said . The astronauts closed up , and after ground attempts to shake the shroud from the target failed , we , ordered to pull away . St aft ord commented , " We are about three feet away from the monster , taking some pictures . "
