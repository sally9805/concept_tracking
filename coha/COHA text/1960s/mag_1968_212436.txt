When the American Electric Power Co. last year asked for bids on one of history 's biggest orders ( $100 million-plus ) for steam-turbine generators , U.S. turbine makers confidently sent in their estimates . Last month they got a big shock . Awarding the contract , American Electric bypassed the two U.S. Goliaths , General Electric and Westinghouse , chose a little-known Swiss-based David called Brown , Boveri &; Co . <P> The Swiss firm will build at least two , and possibly four , mammoth 4,800-ton turbines , each able to generate an unprecedented 1,100,000 kw to 1,300,000 kw of power . The first is to be installed at a nuclear plant in St. Joseph , Mich. , by 1973 . Altogether , four of the firm 's " turbosets " could increase by more than 50% the power now produced by the 30 generating stations in American Electric 's seven-state , Virginia-to-Michigan system . <P> A Felicitous Marriage . All this was no small feat , coming as it did in a market for which no foreign manufacturer has ever made a generator of over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved it was no fluke by winning a Tennessee Valley Authority order for two huge 1,300,000-kw. generators . Despite the fact that the $28.5 million Swiss bid included $4 million in import duties , said the TVA , it was more than $10 million under any other . No less enthusiastic , American Electric President Donald C. Cook cheered the arrival of a " third manufacturer " in the U.S. market , and went out of his way to twit the American producers . " They should welcome this , " he said , " because they are both strong believers in American competition . " <P> <P> With 1967 sales estimated at $735 million , Brown , Boveri is Switzerland 's second largest company ( after Nestl ) , and it took the orders as a long-sought U.S. show of confidence . Brown , Boveri is hardly a household name ; yet B.B.C. , as it is known , has long generated wide respect for its heavy electrical equipment .

It has 17 manufacturing subsidiaries worldwide : 76,000 employees in 40 plants and 250 field offices make and sell turbines and locomotives , heavy transformers and radio transmitters . <P> Founded in 1891 by two ambitious young engineers , Englishman Charles E. L. Brown and Bamberg-born Walter Boveri , the firm got going with a felicitous marriage . Boveri 's father-in-law , a wealthy Zurich silk merchant , provided the partners with an initial $170,000 stake . But technology was B.B.C. 's real dowry . The firm built a pioneering standard-gauge electric locomotive in 1899 , rolled a long way with the expansion of European railroads , and soon began turning out early designs in circuit breakers , turbines and other heavy gear . And while its labs now work on cryogenics , lasers and other new technologies , B.B.C. continues to improve the old ones . A recent B.B.C. breakthrough in rotor-blade design will permit its American Electric turbines to use low-pressure , nuclear-fired steam and turn at a slow 1,800 r.p.m. while producing as much power as conventional turbines spinning twice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
