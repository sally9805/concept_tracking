Lolling at the bar of Washington 's Congressional Hotel last week , Adam Clayton Powell looked the very picture of cavalier confidence . Back from a two-month sojourn with his comely receptionist on the Bahamian isle of South Bimini , the Harlem Democrat bragged of his angling prowess . " Are you worried ? " asked a reporter . Replied Powell : " Do I look it ? " What would he say to the Democratic caucus ? " I 'm going to tell them , " he purred , " to keep the faith , baby . " <P> Congress did indeed keep the faith-with itself and the American people . In the next 48 hours , Powell 's House colleagues coldly cashiered him from the chairmanship of the perquisite-rich Education and Labor Committee , and then barred him , at least for the nonce , from taking his seat in Congress . <P> Powell is a Congressman without a constituency , for the minute he goes back to his New York City district he risks being clapped in jail under contempt of court sentences , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a libel judgment to a Negro widow . That and his alleged gross misuse of committee funds for his own enjoyment were the reasons for his disbarment . The action was as unexpected as it was unprecedented . Not in the 56-year history of the House 's seniority system had a committee chairman been sacked for any sin other than party disloyalty . <P> Thunderclap of Ayes . The 90th Congress ' crushing consensus was evident from the start of the session . The first move was up to the Democrats , and aging Speaker John McCormack declared himself opposed to any disciplinary action . But he quickly ran into a buzz saw of revolt . Liberals led by Morris Udall of Arizona , brother of Interior Secretary Stewart , angrily told the Speaker of constituent pressure to do something about Powell . Shouted Udall : " I 've got to go back to my people ! " Insisted McCormack : " We should n't bow to it . " <P> But bow they did-in part perhaps because of a Lou Harris poll reporting that public confidence in Congress had plummeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic caucus convened , Udall offered a resolution to strip Powell of his chairmanship , stipulating that he would nonetheless battle on the House floor to seat Powell pending a probe of his conduct . Declared Udall : " The people have the right to pick the Representative they want , but they do not have the right to tell the House who shall be chairman of a powerful committee . " <P> <P> A " McCormack substitute " devised by the Speaker , which would have merely suspended Powell from his chairmanship pending investigation , went down in humiliating defeat , 122 to 88 . Then , in a thunderclap of ayes , Udall 's resolution was shouted through by voice vote . The action handed Powell 's chairmanship to the committee 's second-ranking Democrat , Carl Perkins , a quiet Kentuckian and moderate liberal . <P>
