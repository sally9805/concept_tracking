Section II Advanced Preparative and Structural Techniques The object of the experiments in this section is to introduce you to a selection of the more important preparative and structural techniques used in modern inorganic chemistry . Some experiments are mainly of a preparative nature , in others the emphasis is upon a physical technique , but very few are solely preparative or structural . This close conjunction of preparative and structural methods is a feature of modern chemical research . For example , infrared spectroscopy is routinely used by nearly all preparative chemists ; many of the following experiments require you to record an infrared spectrum . Exercises and questions are appended to most experiments . These are not merely riders ' , the solution of which will gain you credit . They are intended to prompt thought about the experiment or a particular product , to lead you to study selected portions of the literature , and above all to stimulate curiosity . Several of the experiments in this book have developed from discussions in the laboratory or from a student extending or improving a given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemistry of about 90 ? 100 hours , you will probably complete eight to twelve of these experiments . These should be selected to cover as wide a range of techniques and chemical types ' as possible . As , in general , there will be many more experiments running than you will be able to do , take a part-time interest in some of the other experiments if you can do this without disturbing the persons concerned . Before you attempt this part of the course , you should study carefully Appendix 1 which deals with Safety in the Laboratory ' . Some experiments in which the primary aim is the use of a physical technique require several compounds : it is not the best use of your limited time in the laboratory to perform all these preparations if the compounds are already available . When a course such as this has run for a year or more there will be a stock of such chemicals ready for your use . If this is not the case , work in pairs for experiments requiring a lot of preparation or share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object of this course is to enable you to see and carry out and learn as much chemistry as possible . The first chapter of this section deals with infrared spectroscopy as this technique is required in connection with many of the other experiments . 81 Chapter 6 Infrared Spectroscopy One of the most characteristic properties of a polynuclear molecule is its infrared spectrum . For a gas , this is its vibration ? rotation ( or , at low frequencies , pure rotation ) spectrum . For condensed phases , the infrared spectrum is effectively the vibrational spectrum , the maximum number of infrared active frequencies possible being ( 3N ? 6 ) for a non-linear molecule of N atoms . Only those vibrational distortions of the molecule which give rise to a change of dipole moment interact with infrared radiation . The Raman spectrum is equally important and informative but commercial instrumentation in this field is neither as plentiful nor as well developed , and , indeed , is useless for materials which are strongly coloured . The activity of Raman scattering is determined by changes in the polarizability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be no coincidences between the infrared and Raman spectra ? the mutual exclusion rule . In most other cases some vibrational modes , at least , will be coincident in frequency in both types of spectrum . We have used the term vibrational mode ' because it implies that a vibration is a property of the molecule as a whole , and is not necessarily localized . This is important and it is essential to understand the implications for inorganic spectroscopy . For purposes of description and calculation , the motions of the constituent atoms of a molecule during a vibration may be referred to a set of coordinates known as internal coordinates ' . Often , these are bond lengths and angles . For example , for the water molecule , the two 0 ? H bond lengths and the H ? O ? H angle would be used . For any given vibrational mode there will be some change in all of these coordinates , although it may well happen that most of the distortion occurs in one or more of them . The distribution of kinetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the geometry of the molecule and the observed vibrational frequencies . If it is found that 62 // most of the kinetic energy of a given vibration is associated with a limited set of bonds and inter-bond angles then it is reasonable to refer to it as a vibration of that set of bonds and angles . This is the basis of the concept of group frequencies ' . Clearly , it is an approxi mate description , although sometimes a very good one ; indeed with-out it the chemical application of molecular spectroscopy would probably still be in its infancy . But the very fact that all group frequencies occur within a range of frequencies indicates that there is some interaction between the vibrations of that group and the rest of the molecule . There is no hard and fast rule as to where the line should be drawn between what is a group frequency and what is not . Organic chemistry deals with a severely restricted set of atoms and bond types : it is therefore not surprising that frequencies associated with certain molecular groups ( e.g. , methyl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout a wide variety of organic molecular types . The inorganic chemist deals with about a hundred different atoms , and a very wide range of bond types , so it is essential for him to treat the concept of group frequencies with reserve . There are many known instances in which a given vibration can only be regarded as being of the whole molecule . This situation is particularly likely for metal-ligand bond vibrations . For example , a recent calcu lation ( I. R. Beattie and T. Gilson ) for the molecule A1II3(NMe3)2 , which has the trigonal bipyramid form with N ? Al ? N linear , shows that in one particular antisymmetric vibration the kinetic energy is distributed in roughly equal proportions between Al ? N bond stretching , NC3 bond stretching and NC3 deformation . There is , thus , no such thing as an N ? Al ? N antisymmetric stretch in this molecule . Most of the spectroscopy with which you will be concerned in this course can still profitably use the group frequency concept ( e.g. the internal vibrations of ? NH3 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more complex systems the above cautions will apply . The only comprehensive reference book available in the inorganic field at the moment is by K. Nakamoto , Infrared Spectra of Inorganic and Coordination Compounds , Wiley , New York , 1963 . A good intro duction to Raman spectroscopy in inorganic chemistry is given by L. A. Woodward in Quart . Rev. , 1956 , 10 , 185 . Instrumentation Several low-cost infrared spectrophotometers are now on the market . They are designed for use at the bench ' and mostly have only three // or four controls . We shall not attempt a detailed description of any one instrument : see the manufacturers ' instructions . In general these instruments cover 2-15 in about 12 min. at a resolution of approximately 3 cm. -1 at 2000 using a rock salt prism . They have double-beam photometer units , thus enabling the user to compensate for cell and solvent absorption . For example , if the spectrum of a compound is to be determined in solution , a cell containing the solution would be put in the sample beam and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference beam . A moving mirror in the photometer unit causes the two beams to be fed alternately at about 12 c. /sec. into the monochromator . Thus , at each wavelength , the detector compares in rapid succession the energy from each beam . The difference between the two amplified signals is fed to a servo system which in turn causes a comb to move in or out of the reference beam until the beams are in balance . The movement of the servo system is displayed on a chart , plotted versus wavelength - i.e. , the absorption spectrum . Sampling ( a ) Solids Two techniques for handling solids are in common use : the mull and the potassium bromide disc . The latter technique involves grinding the solid sample with an excess of alkali halide in a small vibratory mill . The resultant micron-size powder is then strongly compressed in vacuo in a die and sintered to a transparent disc . Although widely used , we regard this method as being of only marginal value for most types of work . It is time-consuming and several specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inorganic compounds are liable to undergo anion exchange with the alkali halide . In contrast , the mull technique is of wide applicability and is rapid . The principles of mulling are ( i ) to reduce the particle size of the solid sample to micron size so that scattering will be low , and ( ii ) to surround the powder with a matrix of refractive index as near to itself as possible , again reducing scatter . Liquid paraffin ( Nujol ' ) is the usual mulling liquid . It has absorption in certain C ? H stretchand-bend regions ( figure 6.1 ) which obscures similar vibrational absorption in any sample . To observe the obscured parts of the spectrum , a mulling agent which is transparent in these regions is employed . The common ones are hexachlorobutadiene ( HCB ) and Fluorlubo ' , a fluorinated product marketed by I.C.I. Ltd . To prepare a mull ( figure 6.2 ) , place 5-10 mg. of the sample in an // agate mortar and allow a small amount of Nujol ' to run onto it from the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this is not capable of such fine control . ) Make a fairly stiff paste , removing the mull from both pestle and mortar several times , using the spatula . This ensures good grinding and mixing of the layer of solid which sticks to the agate . Gradually thin the paste with Nujol ' until the consistency is right for the spectrometer to be used . Spread a thin line of sample down the centre of a rock salt plate and cover with a second plate . Mount in a suitable holder in the sample beam . If the mull is too thick and absorbs too strongly , a little may be squeezed out by gentle pressure . If this does not work , start again . Never grind the plates together in an attempt to thin a u ull ; you will only damage the plates and they are expensive . NOTE Samples containing nitrate and nitrite groups are liable to an ion exchange with the rock salt plates . Check the plates for cleanliness , and re-polish if necessary . ( b ) Solutions It must first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the region of interest . If one is available , proceed as follows : ( i ) Fill the sample cell ( figure 6.3 ) with solvent . Suck it clean at the pump . ( ii ) Refill and empty a further two or three times . ( iii ) Fill and place in the spectrometer sample beam . ( iv ) Adjust the variable path cell ( figure 6.4 ) ( careful ! it is expensive ) to the same path length as that of the sample cell . Flush with solvent , as above , and fill . Place it in the reference beam . ( v ) Run a spectrum over the region of interest . Adjust the variable path cell if necessary , so as to give complete cancellation . ( Negative absorption means that the reference cell is thicker than the sample cell. ) ( vi ) Empty the sample cell and fill it with a dilute solution of the sample . Place it in the instrument . ( vii ) Record spectrum . NOTE In regions where the solvent is more than 60% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if indeed any spectrum is obtained in this region . 6 . Infrared Spectroscopy 67 6.1 Preparation and Study of Two Inorganic Isomers The complex Co(NO2) ( NH3 ) 5 ? C12 exists in two isomeric forms , Co ? NO2 and Co ? ONO . The difference is clearly demonstrated by the infrared spectra of the compounds . Both isomers are prepared from CoCI(NH3)5C12i the product obtained depending on the pH. ( i ) **29;467;TOOLONG chloride , CoCl(NH3)sCl2 This compound is one of the most important of the cobaltammines and it is the starting substance for the preparation of many coordination complexes of cobalt . Note the ease of oxidation of the hexaamminecobalt(ri) ion . Dissolve 10 g. cobalt carbonate in the smallest possible amount of concentrated hydrochloric acid , filter , cool and add to a mixture of 125 ml. 10% ammonia and 25 g. ammonium carbonate in 125 ml. water ( 0.880 ammonia is approximately 30% ) . Draw a rapid stream of air through the solution by means of a filter pump for about 3 hr. , then add 75 g. ammonium chloride and evaporate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sludge is obtained . Acidify the product with dilute hydrochloric acid , stirring constantly until evolution of carbon dioxide has ceased and the solution is faintly acid . Neutralize with ammonia again and add an excess of 5 ml. 0.880 ammonia . Warm the solution on a water bath for about an hour to ensure the disappearance of any tetra-ammine salts , dilute to 200 ml. , add 150 ml. concentrated hydrochloric acid , heat the resultant solution on a water bath for 30 ? 45 min. and cool , when crystals will separate . Filter off the crystals and wash them with dilute hydrochloric acid , then with alcohol . Dry on a porous plate . ( ii ) **28;498;TOOLONG chloride , Co(NO2) ( NH3 ) 5Cl2 Dissolve 5 g. **29;528;TOOLONG chloride in 50 ml. water to which 12.5 ml. 10% ammonia has been added . Filter , cool and acidify slightly by the addition of dilute hydrochloric acid . Now add 6 g. sodium nitrite and heat until the red precipitate first formed has completely dissolved . Add 65 ml. concentrated hydrochloric acid , cool in ice , collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash with alcohol and dry in air . ( iii ) **28;559;TOOLONG chloride , Co . NO ) ( NH3 ) 5C12 Dissolve 2.5 g. **29;589;TOOLONG chloride by gently warming with 40 ml. water to which 9 ml. 0.880 ammonia has been // added . Filter , and neutralize the filtrate with dilute hydrochloric acid . Add 2.5 g. sodium nitrite and then 2.5 ml. hydrochloric acid ( 1 : 1 ) . A red precipitate will gradually form ; filter and wash , first with cold water and then with alcohol . IBomerization The two isomers exist in equilibrium , the equilibrium lying much nearer the nitro compound than the nitrito . The latter form changes into the more stable nitro complex after several months . The process may be accelerated either by heating or by mixing a 10% solution of the nitrito compound with an equal volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid . Distinguish between the isomers by infrared spectroscopy . Calcu late the number of vibrations expected for the coordinated ? NO2 group and draw out the rough forms of all the modes associated with the CoNO2 moeity including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 ? . Assign absorption due to the coordinated ammonia molecules . 6.2 The Effect of Symmetry on the Infrared Spectrum of the Sulphate Group Any regular tetrahedral AB4 molecule or ion should exhibit only two fundamental absorptions in the infrared spectrum . The vibrational modes which give rise to these absorptions may be described roughly as stretching and bending modes ; both are triply degenerate . In the case of an ionic sulphate , two strong infrared absorptions are in fact observed . If , in a given crystal , the symmetry of the environment of the sulphate group is less than tetrahedral , then additional weak absorption may be seen due to vibrations which are forbidden when the full tetrahedral symmetry is applicable . Complexes are known in which the sulphate group is ionic , mono-dentate or bidentate , and the splitting and changes of intensity of absorption bands due to that group beautifully illustrate the effects of progressively lowering the symmetry of the ion . // Procedure Record the infrared spectra ( 5 ? 17 p , ) of the following as Nujol ' mulls : NoTE The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ u . This does not really matter although you will not see the second band of the sulphate ion ( that due to bending of the O ? S ? O angles ) in its various sites . The effect is just as well exhibited by the higher frequency band . Identify the bands due to the sulphate group in each complex . With the aid of a demonstrator ( if necessary ) draw out the rough form of the vibrations giving rise to each absorption . List the symmetry elements of the sulphate groups in each of the three environments . Preparation of complexes There is no point in preparing the complexes ( ii ) ? ( iv ) if they are available from a previous experiment or class . Only very small quantities ( 5 mg. ) are needed for spectroscopy so that one preparation of each compound will probably provide enough material for the whole class . The preparations are given below . ( ii ) Hexa-amminecobalt(r) sulphate pentahydrate , Co(NH3)s2 ( 504 ) 3.5 H2O . Dissolve 5 g . Co(NH3)sC13 ' ' in 50 ml. hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heat the solution to 60 ? c and add 25 ml. 95% alcohol . Warm for a few minutes on a water bath to dissolve the solid and set aside to crystallize . After 24 hr. , crystallization should be complete ; wash the crystals at the pump with 95% alcohol until the filtrate is neutral . Dissolve the salt in hot water and precipitate by addition of alcohol . Filter and wash with alcohol until // acid-free . Dry in air . If required , further recrystallization may be effected from hot water . ( iii ) **30;620;TOOLONG bromide , Co(SO4) ( NH3 ) 5Br . Stir 10 g . CoCl(NH3)5C12* with 36 g. concentrated sulphuric acid in a porcelain dish : add the acid in small portions so that the evo lution of hydrogen chloride gas is not too violent . When evolution has ceased , heat the resulting oily mass on a boiling water bath for 4 hr. , during which more hydrogen chloride will be given off . Dilute with water and continue heating on the water bath until there is no more evaporation . Pour the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . If it is necessary to filter , do so as quickly as possible . Stand for 24 hr. , whereupon the acid sulphate precipitates in good yield as shiny , rectangular violet-red plates . Decant the strongly coloured mother liquor and transfer the crystals to a sintered-glass filter . Wash with 95% alcohol and dry in air . Dissolve 4 g. acid sulphate in 120 ml. cold water and treat the solution with a mixture of 20 ml. concentrated hydrobromic acid ( b.p. 126 ? c ) and 80 ml. water . Gradually add alcohol , whilst stirring , to precipitate the product as a fine violet-red crystalline powder . Wash with alcohol until acid-free and dry in air . ( iv ) **37;652;TOOLONG bromide , Co(en)2 ' SO 41 Br . Add ten grams of trans-Co(en)2C12Cl ( use a stock sample , or prepare as in experiment 15.1 ) to 20 ml. concentrated sulphuric acid in a beaker . When the initial effervescence has subsided , heat gently . The complex slowly dissolves with evolution of hydrogen chloride and a violet solution results . Raise the temperature to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then allow the oil to cool . Pour into 1 litre of alcohol which is continually stirred to prevent formation of an oil . Filter off the solid , wash with alcohol and then ether . Dry in vacuo . Dissolve the deliquescent solid in 20 ml. water and treat with 5 g. lithium bromide in 5 ml. water and then leave in a refrigerator at 0 ? c for three days . Filter off the purple crystals , wash with alcohol // and then ether . Air dry . If the mother liquors are left for a further three days a second crop of Co(en)2H20 ? SO4Br ? H2O will be obtained . Heat powdered specimens of the above product at 110 ? c for 24 hr. in an oven . Recrystallize the Co(en)2SO4Br by dissolution in a minimum of cold water and addition of sodium bromide . The product crystallizes as short purple needles . NOTE After running each spectrum check that the rock salt plates are spectroscopically clean . The NO group will readily penetrate the plates : if this occurs , they must be re-polished ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each compound due to stretching of the NO group , ( b ) all other bands observed . Discuss the variation of vNo in terms of bonding mechanisms . 6.3 Infrared Spectra of Complexes Containing the NO Group There are several ways in which the NO group can combine with metal atoms , giving a variety of compounds in which the group may be considered as ranging from NO+ through neutral NO to NO- . The infrared stretching frequency of the group is an excellent indicator of the nature of the bonding . Thus , NO+ may absorb as high as 2220 em. -1 and NO- as low as 1045 Nitric oxide itself absorbs at 1883 cm. -1 and examples can be found of NO absorption in complexes at most positions in the range 2000-1600 Procedure Record the infrared spectra , 2-15 as Nujol ' mulls , of the following compounds : // Preparations Do not spend time preparing more than one of the compounds needed . If they are all available from laboratory stock , so much the better . The preparations of NOSbC16 and ( NO ) 2 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The chromium and cobalt complexes may be prepared as follows .

Recrystallize the red salt twice from dilute ammonia . Chapter 7 High-Temperature Preparations One of the most common uses of high temperatures in synthetic work is in the preparation of metal halides . The general procedure involves passing the halogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal or an oxide ? carbon mixture . Many variants of procedure and technique have been recorded ; the particular form of the apparatus used will depend largely upon the volatility of the reagents and products involved . 7.1 Preparation of Titanium Tetrabromide , TiBr4 TiO2 + 2 C + 2 Br2  --   --  - TiBr4 + 2 CO Assemble the apparatus shown in figure 7.1 . Bottle C contains concentrated sulphuric acid . Forty-five grams of bromine are introduced into D. The combustion tube is of Pyrex and contains at its centre a Pyrex boat holding an intimate mixture of 10 g. titanium(ty) oxide and 6 g. sugar charcoal . // Pass a moderate stream of dry nitrogen through the by-pass AB and bring the furnace up to 300 ? c for about 30 mill . This will dry the apparatus and reactants and moisture will collect in E. Remove this by flaming and then attach a drying tube to E. Close by-pass AB , thereby passing nitrogen through the bromine and into the furnace , which is now brought to 550 ? c , and reduce the flow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condense the solid titanium tetrabromide . When reaction is complete ( approximately 4 hr. ) , switch off the furnace and open by-pass AB . Warm E to about 100 ? c . The flow of nitrogen removes excess bromine vapour . Maintaining the flow of nitrogen , remove E from the reaction tube and quickly close it with a glass stopper . Replace the drying tube by the apparatus in figure 7.2 . Distil the titanium tetrabromide ( b.p. 230 ? c ; m.p . 39 ? c ) . Remove and stopper the sample bulb(s) and transfer the amber-coloured product to tared ampoules in a dry-bag ( this must be very dry ) . The product is a crystalline hygroscopic solid , soluble in many organic solvents but very readily hydrolyzed by water . Exercises Determine the bromide content of your product .

The end , A , of the reaction tube should be kept as close to the furnace as possible as product tends to condense before reaching the flask . Ten grams of vanadium metal powder is placed in a porcelain boat in the centre of the reaction tube . Flush the apparatus with dry nitrogen for about half an hour , raising the temperature to 300 ? c . Stop the nitro gen flow and fix a drying tube to the condenser . Chlorine is now passed ( from a cylinder ) and the temperature brought up to 450 ? c . The chlorine may be diluted with nitrogen if the product tends to form too quickly .

Warm the mixture and allow to reflux for 12 hr . Then remove volatile products by ( a ) distillation and ( b ) evacuation on a vacuum line ( not a water pump ) with gentle heating to 80 ? c by means of an oil bath . Using a good dry-bag , transfer the resulting deep-purple solid to tared ampoules . Yield , approximately 29 g .

Pass hydrogen chloride gas ( from a cylinder , or prepared as in experiment 11.3 ) mixed with nitrogen through the apparatus until all the air is swept out and then gently heat the metal in a slow stream of the gas . Water and a cloudy sublimate of MoO3.2 HC1 will be formed and should be removed from the apparatus by gentle flaming . Continue until no more sublimate forms . Cool in a stream of hydrogen chloride . 7 . High-Temperature Preparations 77 Fit a calcium chloride guard tube to the open end of the reaction tube . Attach a chlorine cylinder in place of the hydrogen chloride supply , taking care to flush out the delivery tube , and pass a slow stream of chlorine ? nitrogen over the molybdenum .

Chapter 8 Vacuum-Line Preparations Many operations and preparations are conveniently carried out under vacuum . It is often the easiest way to exclude oxygen or other potential reactants . Before attempting any experiments involving the use of the vacuum line you must be thoroughly familiar with the technique of operation described below . General high-vacuum technique A good rotary pump will produce a vacuum of approximately 5 x 10-3 mm. mercury in a leak-free glass system . This is adequate for most preparative work . Vacua of 10-6 mm. mercury are readily attained with a mercury or oil diffusion pump backed by a rotary pump and may be necessary in some cases , particularly when reactants or products are likely to be decomposed by the traces of water remaining in the glass line at rotary pump pressure . SAFETY NOTES ( i ) The exhaust of all rotary pumps should be led via a tube to a fume cupboard or window . This is always good practice but it is vital with a vacuum pump used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has led to fatal accidents . ( ii ) It is wise to wear safety glasses when operating a vacuum line . Demountable joints may be either conical or hemispherical in shape , figure 8.1 , the latter being used when some bending must be allowed . They are lubricated with a thin film of a grease having a low vapour pressure . The choice of grease depends upon the temperature to which any part of the line is to be heated and on the chemical nature of the compounds which will be in contact with it . The properties of some commonly used greases are given in Table 8.1. 78 It is sometimes desirable to make demountable joints semipermanent and for this purpose a hydrocarbon wax is generally used , e.g. , Picien or Apiezon W40 , which soften at about 80 ? and 40 ? e respectively . The most reliable way of joining glass parts is to make a fused seal . A few basic operations on glass-ware are described in Appendix 2 . You will not need to know anything more about the technique of glass work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of high-vacuum tap are illustrated in figure 8.2 . Type 2 is often preferred ; there is less likelihood of a leak occurring since air pressure forces the key into the barrel when the line is evacuated . To grease a tap , run a layer of grease down each side of the key , insert this into the barrel and rotate gently to distribute the grease . NEVER turn an ungreased tap . When , for chemical reasons , grease can not be tolerated , there are two alternatives : either a greaseless valve or a mercury cut-off may be used . Typical designs are shown in figure 8.3. // In every vacuum line a cold trap is placed immediately before the pump ( diffusion or rotary ) , the usual coolant being liquid nitrogen ( b.p. - 195 ? c ) . This prevents ( a ) condensable vapours from reaching the pump and being dissolved in the oil with consequent raising of its vapour pressure and a decrease in pump efficiency , * and ( b ) prevents back-streaming of vapours from the pumps to the vacuum line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generally by means of a McLeod gauge in which a large volume of gas ( say 200 ml. ) is compressed to a small but measurable volume in a capillary tube . For use with preparative vacuum lines a Vacustat ' gauge is sufficiently accurate . Pressures greater than 1 mm. are conviently measured on a simple manometer . Leak testing should be carried out when a new line or section is used for the first time . Evacuate the line to rotary pump vacuum and inspect all fused-glass joints with a Tesla ' high-frequency probe . A violet discharge ( colour depending upon the pressure in the line ) will be observed . The discharge from the probe will be drawn towards any pin-hole ' leaks when the probe is run over the affected area . The vacuum line that you will use is illustrated in figure 8.4 . Further units will be added at X , depending upon the experiment to be performed . // The line is built of small , demountable units because experience has shown that the inevitable breakages which occur during a course cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be fitted by the student . In a line containing only fusedglass joints the alternative is to clean the line thoroughly , cut out the damaged section , wait for a glass blower , etc. ! Operation is as follows 1 . Starting up We assume that the whole line is at atmospheric pressure and all taps are closed except the air-inlet tap T1. ( i ) Ensure that all taps , and the conical joint on the trap , are properly greased and free-moving . Consult a demonstrator if they are not . ( ii ) Close T1 and switch on the pump . Check that the pump is working properly and that it has sufficient oil in the reservoir . ( iii ) Open tap T2 gently . ( iv ) When the bulk of the air has been removed , place a Dewar flask of liquid nitrogen around the cold trap . Remember to top-up the Dewar from time to time . ( v ) Measure the pressure by rotating the Vacustat ' to its working position . It should be . 0.1 mm. mercury before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i ) Close all taps . ( ii ) Switch off the rotary pump and open tap T1 immediately . ( iii ) Remove the Dewar of liquid nitrogen from the trap . PRECAUTIONS Although Pyrex-glass apparatus is fairly robust , it can , of course , be broken by careless or clumsy handling . The following precautions must be taken . ( i ) When turning vacuum taps use both hands , one to steady the barrel and the other to turn the key . If the laboratory is cold the grease on the taps may be very stiff . Before attempting to turn the taps they must be warmed gently with a hot air blower ( or hair dryer ) . ( ii ) Always consider carefully the consequences of opening a tap . Do nothing suddenly on a vacuum line . This is particularly important with apparatus containing mercury . To set a column of mercury in rapid motion iii a glass apparatus is equivalent to hitting it with a hammer ! // ( iii ) A trap cooled in liquid nitrogen is at a temperature below that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trap liquid oxygen will condense in it leading to two possible hazards : ( a ) an explosion hazard if a readily oxidizable condensate is already in the trap ( c.f. , rocket fuels ! ) ; ( b ) if the trap is closed off and allowed to warm up the liquid oxygen will vapourize and the resulting pressure will shatter both apparatus and bystander . Consequently , liquid nitrogen Dewars must always be removed before air is let into the trap . If large quantities of air have to be pumped out through the trap it should not be cooled until after the air has been removed . 8.1 Preparation of Nitrosonium Hexachlorantimonate , NOSbC16 Many salts containing the nitrosonium cation can be prepared by reacting nitrosyl chloride with an anhydrous halide . For example , NOC1 + SbC15  --  NO SbC16 These compounds are moisture-sensitive and must be handled only in a dry-box . Read the general instructions on vacuum technique ( pp. 78 ) before proceeding . Procedure ( i ) Prepare 3 ? 4 g. nitrosyl chloride by the action of excess nitrosyl sulphuric acid* on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nitrosyl chloride in a trap fitted with a calcium chloride guard tube , cooled in an acetone ? solid carbon dioxide bath . Connect the trap to the vacuum line in the position shown in figure 8.5 . Close T4 and freeze the liquid gas in C by surrounding the trap with a Dewar of liquid nitrogen . Evacuate C. ( ii ) Using a dry-bag , transfer approximately 2 ml. antimony penta chloride to bulb A , which must then be stoppered . NOTE If it is necessary to open a new ampoule of antimony pentachloride use the method of Appendix 2 . Connect the bulb to the vacuum line , freeze in liquid nitrogen , and evacuate .

Seven grams of potassium perchlorate in the 250 ml. round-bottom flask are treated with 70 g. fluorosulphonic acid ( technical grade ) from the dropping funnel . SAFETY NOTE When handling fluorosulphonic acid wear rubber gloves as it can burn the skin severely . At the end of the experiment , wash your hands whilst wearing the gloves . // Stir slowly during the addition and gently raise the temperature . At about 50 ? c perchloryl fluoride will begin to come off . Continue warming gently to about 85 ? c .

Exercises Look up the infrared spectrum of C103F ( J. Chem . Phys. , 1956 , 25 , 1128 ) . Draw out the normal modes of vibration of the molecule . Chapter 9 Inert-Atmosphere Technique There are many instances in which it is not permissible to carry out a chemical or physical process in contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxidation or hydrolysis . In such cases an inert atmosphere must be provided , or it might be preferable to work in vacuo . The choice in any particular instance will depend upon the nature of the reaction and reactants , their sensitivity to moisture , oxygen , etc. , and the available equipment . The use of inert atmospheres in chemistry and metallurgy , already important , is constantly increasing . A major stimulant has been the atomic energy industry and the need to handle and fabricate parts in new materials . Large inert-atmosphere machining rooms have been built by some firms , operatives entering through locks , wearing breathing gear . It is important to specify , if possible , the maximum permissible levels of the atmospheric constituents . This may only be an approximate indication . Thus , nitrosonium hexachlorantimonate , p. 83 , may be handled readily in a dry-box using phosphorus pentoxide as desiccant , whereas some volatile fluorides , for example , are only safe if handled in a baked-out vacuum line . A vacuum of 1.5 X 10-2 mm. mercury is equivalent to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is decided that an inert atmosphere offers the best solution to a given problem , there is still the choice of using either a dry-box ' or glass apparatus in which an inert atmosphere is maintained . Although some operations ( e.g. , distillation ) are routinely carried out in standard apparatus filled with nitrogen , this method often becomes cumbersome , especially when filtrations and other transfer operations must be performed . It may be worth constructing special apparatus if the process is to be carried out on many occasions ; see , for example , experiment 11.8 . The preparation of chromous acetate , 89 // described below , should be compared with that of Inorg . Synth. , 3 , 148 , in which all-glass equipment is used . For many problems , a dry-box ' is highly convenient , as normal operations and techniques may be used without modification . If moisture is the only danger , the box may be air-filled and dried with a suitable desiccant . If oxygen and/or moisture is the hazard , nitrogen or argon are commonly used to flush the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the literature , and several are available commercially . For synthetic studies , a type of box devel oped by I.C.I. Ltd. has many advantages ( figure 9.1 ) . The entry chamber is large enough to permit the introduction of apparatus , but small enough to be flushed free of atmosphere in four minutes . Many dry-boxes , including some commercial types , have large vacuum entry chambers . Although these have their uses , they are often incon venient and unnecessary . A more logical alternative is the vacuum dry-box : this can be completely evacuated ( the gloves being pro tected by cover plates ) and then re-filled with a suitable atmosphere . They are expensive . Since even small dry-boxes generally cost at least ? 100 , much of your work requiring an inert atmosphere will be done in a polythene dry-bag* ( figure 9.2 ) , which will be suitable for most operations . Which-ever piece of equipment you use , dust your hands well with talcum powder ( unscented ! ) before putting them in the gloves . Dry-bag procedure Remove one glove and introduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . Replace the glove and gently collapse the bag . Inflate with nitrogen from a cylinder , taking care not to fill to too high a pressure ? the bag should always feel flabby . Turn off the nitrogen . Collapse the bag by squeezing gently . Repeat this procedure three times . The bag is then ready for use . Dry-box procedure The large dry-boxes ( figure 9.1 ) are prepared for use as follows : introduce a polythene bag sufficiently large that it fills the box when inflated . Open the outlet valve and inflate the collapsed polythene bag with nitrogen , thereby expelling air from the box . Turn off the nitrogen , remove the bag from its nipple and collapse it , expelling its content into the box . Re-connect to the nitrogen inlet and repeat the process twice . This is much more economical on nitrogen than flushing the box . // Filtration Filtration in a dry bag may be effected by using a pipette filler attached to the suction nipple of a Buchner filter flask . Alternatively , a vacuum lead may be sealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facility , pass nitrogen into the bag to compensate for that removed by the pump . Infrared sampling It is often necessary to prepare a mull or solution for spectroscopy , in the dry-box . Solutions present no special difficulty . Mulls should be made in the usual way ( see p. 64 ) . If the compound under investigation is not too air-sensitive , it will probably be quite safe to mount the mull between two rock salt plates as usual . A small amount of decomposition may occur around the edges . In other cases , a thin strip of Scotch Tape ' may be run around the edge of the plates , sealing the mull from the air . Transfer the plates to and from the spectrometer in a small nitrogen filled bottle . Weighing Weighing in a dry-bag or box is generally unnecessary , given adequate forethought . A balance takes up too much of the already limited space , and will , in any case , be exposed to a rather corrosive atmosphere . Let us suppose that a product in a dry-box is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Remove the top of the ampoule by making a neat scratch around it with a glass-knife . Snap it off by hand . ( See Appendix 2 ) . ( ii ) Stick a small label onto the ampoule and then weigh . Pencil the weight on the label . ( iii ) Take the ampoules into the dry-box and fill them . Plug the necks with cotton wool . ( iv ) Remove from the dry-box and quickly seal off with a glass working torch fitted with a fine jet . Do not use a Bunsen burner . ( v ) Weigh the sealed ampoule together with the removed top portion ( minus cotton wool ) . ( vi ) Calculate the weight of compound contained and record on the label . It is important to know the weight of compound in an ampoule , especially if the compound is likely to be used in a reaction . Thus , the whole of the contents of the ampoule may be used and other reactants calculated accordingly . You will be able to work out other such points of technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acetate , Cr ( CH3 ? CO2 ) 2 ? H2O Chromium(n) salts are extremely sensitive to oxidation and must be prepared under an inert atmosphere . Before starting the preparation , check that your dry-box ' ( or bag ) is in good condition and well flushed with nitrogen . Water for use in the box should be boiled and cooled under nitrogen . Solvents should be distilled under nitrogen . Procedure Place 17.0 g. zinc in a beaker*k and add a solution of 10 g. hydrated chromic chloride , CrC13.6 H2O , in 11.6 ml. water . Pour in 23.0 ml. concentrated hydrochloric acid and cover the beaker with a watch glass . After about 15 min. the solution will have turned blue . Rinse the watch glass , filter the solution in a Buchner funnel and rinse with water . Immediately add a slurry of 27.5 g. sodium acetate in 35.5 ml. water . Stir with a glass rod until the red chromium(ii) acetate is precipitated . Filter , and wash several times with small portions of water until the washings are free of chloride . Wash finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Record the yield and ampoule a portion of the product . Chromous acetate is a good starting material for the prepar ation of other chromium(n) salts . Use a portion of your prod uct to prepare the double salt chromous hydrazine sulphate , CrSO4 ? ( N2H4 ) 2 ? H2SO4 ? H2O , as follows . To a suspension of chromous acetate in water , add a solution of hydrazine sulphate  --  in boiling water ( 30 ml. for each gram hydrazine sulphate ) . Then add 3x sulphuric acid very slowly until , on shaking , the red solid just dissolves to a dull-blue solution . From this , a clean-blue crystalline precipitate of the double salt will settle out over about 2 hr . Once formed , it is air-stable . Wash , as above , with water and then ethanol . Dry in air .

It is often convenient , however , to be able to prepare them from a readily available hydrated halide , expecially as many anhydrous halides are hygroscopic . Treatment of a hydrated halide with thionyl chloride is a method of wide applicability and is particularly convenient as the non-metallic products are volatile . Near its boiling point , thionyl chloride begins to decompose according to the scheme For this reason the solvent acts as an oxidizing medium and is therefore unsuitable for dehydration of halides which are susceptible to oxidation . ( i ) Using the following procedure , prepare one or more anhydrous halides from their hydrated forms . ( Discuss your choice with the demonstrator before beginning . It is often convenient to prepare a halide which can be used in another experiment , e.g. , COC12 for the cobalticinium preparation , experiment 11.4 , or CrC13 for experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a round-bottom flask and add 30 ml. freshly distilled thionyl chloride .

Decomposition will be indicated by colour changes . Proceed as in ( a ) but do not remove all the thionyl chloride : con centrate to about 10 ml . Refrigeration of the solution will produce crystals of the deep-violet product , which should be filtered and washed with small portions of thionyl chloride . Place in an ampoule and dry as above .

Procedure Wash 4 g. sodium in ether to free it from paraffin and cut it into very small lumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clean , dry , 250 ml. beaker in a fume cupboard . Cover the beaker with a gauze as much as possible , and between each addition of sodium , stir the mercury well . Safety glasses must be worn during this experiment . Dissolve 4 g. sodium nitrite in 12 ml. water contained in a 250 ml. two-neck round-bottom flask and immerse in ice water . Pass a steady stream of nitrogen through the flask and slowly add the sodium amalgam with constant agitation of the flask . Transfer the mixture ? in a stream of nitrogen to prevent absorption of carbon dioxide ? to a separating funnel and shake thoroughly , frequently allowing the hydrogen to escape . When no further gas is liberated and the reduc tion is complete , leave the separating funnel for about half an hour to allow mercury droplets to settle . // Run off the mercury and then run the liquor into another beaker containing 50 ml. of ethyl alcohol , keeping the tip of the separating funnel beneath the surface of the alcohol to avoid exposure to the atmosphere . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be quickly washed through with 5 ml. water . Stir vigor ously for several minutes until the lower syrupy layer is transformed into a paste , which on trituration with a glass rod produces a mass of white crystals . Filter on a sintered glass filter , wash with several small portions of ethyl alcohol and then with ether . Remove occluded ether in a vacuum desiccator . The product may be recrystallized by dissolution in water followed by reprecipitation with ethyl alcohol . Dry as above . Clean the mercury by carefully washing with water and then dilute nitric acid . Exercises 1 . Examine the effect of the following reagents on solutions of sodium hypo-nitrite and explain your observations : an acidimetric indicator , silver nitrate , dilute hydrochloric acid , acidified potassium permanganate , alkaline potassium permanganate . 2 . Either : determine the sodium content by means of a flame photometer , or determine the hyponitrite content gravimetrically as Ag2N202 .

Other experiments requiring extensive use of inert-atmosphere techniques are 7.3 ( Preparation of MoC15 ) , and 11.8 ( Preparation of Organic Phosphines ) . Chapter 10 Non-Aqueous Solvents Inorganic chemistry in the liquid phase has until recently been dominated by that of aqueous solutions . The main factors which have engendered this situation have been the ready availability of water and the need for more sophisticated techniques when working in nonaqueous media . Modern research has shown that a knowledge of aqueous chemistry only gives a very biased view of inorganic chemistry . Many compounds which are entirely unknown in aqueous media are readily prepared in non-aqueous solution . Anhydrous materials can also differ remarkably in structure from their hydrated forms . Severe limitations are placed upon the formation and stability of metal complexes in aqueous solution since unless their ligands are bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cu(NH3)6 ) 2+ , for example , can only be prepared in liquid ammonia . Non-aqueous solvents in common use include ammonia , dinitrogen tetroxide , sulphur dioxide , acetic acid , bromine trifluoride and hydrofluoric acid . Another class of solvents of great potential , and relevant to the atomic-energy industry , is that of molten salts . It should be emphasized that non-aqueous solvents must be rigorously dry , as even traces of water can profoundly affect their properties . Thus , hydrogen fluoride is highly corrosive in the presence of water and yet the strictly anhydrous liquid is a good solvent for proteins , from which solutions they may be recovered unchanged . SAFETY NOTE . In all experiments with inorganic nonaqueous solvents great care must be taken in handling and technique : ( i ) wear rubber gloves throughout ; ( ii ) always use a good fume cupboard or a closed glass system with all vents or exhausts led to a fume cupboard ; ( iii ) if spillages occur , destroy non-volatile solvents chemically . 96 // 10.1 Solvent Properties of Liquid Ammonia Liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other inorganic non-aqueous solvent . It undergoes self-ionization according to the equation ammonia may , of course , be obtained simply by using the cylinder in the normal upright position . Test-tubes of liquid ammonia should be plugged loosely with cotton wool to prevent entry of moisture . SAFETY NOTE Wear gloves , to prevent skin burns , and safety glasses when handling liquid ammonia . Since vessels at room temperature are hot compared with the liquid gas , b.p. ? 33.40c , take care to avoid violent boiling and splashing . For the study of reactions in liquid ammonia , the most convenient containers are transparent Dewar test-tubes of approximately 25 and 65 ml. capacity . The technique of transferring the liquid gas from a cylinder is indicated in figure 10.1 ; open the valve slowly . Gaseous // Procedure Carry out a selection of the following tests , working in pairs so as to make the best use of time . 1 .

Comment on the relative stabilities of complexes of lead(iv) and tin(iv). 10.4 Preparation of Anhydrous Copper Nitrate , Cu(NO3)2 SAFETY NOTE This experiment must be carried out in an efficient fume cupboard . Anhydrous copper nitrate can only be prepared in a non-aqueous medium ; attempted dehydration of the hydrate , Cu(NO3)2.31120 , results in decomposition of the anion . Direct reaction of copper with liquid dinitrogen tetroxide leads to the desired product . Liquid dinitrogen tetroxide undergoes self-ionization according to the equation Due to the low dielectric constant ( e = 2.4 at 18 ? c ) and electrical conductivity of the liquid , the equilibrium lies well to the left ; consequently , ionic compounds are insoluble in it . If , however , liquid dinitrogen tetroxide is diluted with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , e = 37 ) , it becomes much more reactive due to the shift of the equilibrium . Addition of ethyl acetate to the liquid greatly enhances its reactivity although the ester has a dielectric constant of only 6.02 at 25 ? c . Apart from its dielectric effect , ethyl acetate also acts as a donor towards the N204 molecule and the N0+ ion : // 1 . Preparation of dinitrogen tetroxide , N2O4 Heat dried commercial lead nitrate in a steel tube , or a glass tube containing a liner or boat . Condense the water and nitric acid evolved and pass the dinitrogen tetroxide through a phosphorus pentoxide drying tower to remove the remaining water vapour ( figure 10.2 ) . Condense and solidify the gas in a flask cooled to - 78 ? c and protected from the atmosphere by a phosphorus pentoxide guard tube . The solid should be colourless and the liquid , just above its melting point , pale yellow-brown . Traces of water in the liquid will produce a green colouration due to dinitrogen trioxide. 2 . Preparation of copper nitrate , Cu(NO3)2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wash it with water and acetone and dry well . Transfer to a large oven-dried Quickfit test-tube ( B24 or larger ) , closed by a phosphorus pentoxide guard tube . Introduce 20 ml. dry ethyl acetate , cool in ice , and add 20 ml. dinitrogen tetroxide . Allow the mixture to warm slowly to room temperature . When reaction is complete - several hours or over-night - remove any unreacted copper , re-cool in ice , and add a fur ther quantity of dinitrogen tetroxide slowly until no more blue Cu(NO3)2 ? N2O4 is precipitated . Keep the tube closed with the guard tube whenever possible . Separate the blue solid in a dried filter tube containing a coarse sintered glass disc ( figure 10.3 ) . Wash with dinitrogen tetroxide and transfer to a subliming vessel on the general-purpose vacuum line . Pump off occluded dinitrogen tetroxide at room temperature and decompose the adduct by raising the // temperature to 120 ? c using an oil bath . With solid carbon dioxide ? acetone coolant in the cold finger of the sublimer , bring the oil bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N204 in a small trap and , at the end of the experiment , allow it to warm up in a fume cupboard . When sublimation of the anhydrous copper nitrate is complete , admit dry air to the vacuum line and remove the product to a dry-box . Hydration is immediate in the presence of moisture . Ampoule the product . Exercises Analyze for copper by precipitation and weighing as Cu(en)2HgI4 . Enumerate and explain the differences between hydrated and anhydrous copper nitrate . What is the structure of each ( include the gas phase ) ? 10.5 Preparation of Iodine Monochloride and Iodine Trichloride and Some Adducts of the Form ( R I ) +ClThe interhalogons ICI and IC13 are readily prepared . Iodine is much more electropositive than chlorine and has a comparatively low ionization potential . Groups with electron-donating properties ( e.g. , // pyridine ) stabilize the iodine cation , forming adducts of the type ( R - ) - I ) +Cl - . Iodine monochloride is a self-ionizing non-aqueous solvent . Preparation of iodine monochloride Condense approximately 10 ml. liquid chlorine into an accurately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooled to - 78 ? c . Add approximately 25 g. iodine , accurately weighed , and allow the contents of the tube to warm slowly to room temperature , whereupon uncombined chlorine will boil off . Reweigh the tube and calculate the weight of chlorine combined with iodine . From this weight , deduce the amount of iodine needed to make the stoichei ometry 1 : 1 . Add the required amount of iodine , stopper and warm gently until a dark liquid is formed . Allow the product to stand over-night .

REACTIONS WITH PHENYL-LITHIUM Organolithium compounds are of considerable importance in syn thetic work due to their high reactivity , simple preparation and ready solubility in inert solvents . They are mainly used for the same sort of syntheses as Grignard reagents but often confer advantages such as greater reactivity or ease of working up . It is usual to prepare and use an organolithium reagent in situ , rather than isolate it . The subject has been excellently reviewed by G. E. Coates in his Organo metallic Compounds , Methuen , London , 1960 . Organolithium reagents readily react with a variety of covalent halides , such as those of boron , tin , phosphorus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Li + RX  --  RLi + LiX Lithium metal is generally supplied as rather large , hard lumps . Cut off and weigh a suitable lump and hammer it into a thin sheet . Scrape it free of its adherent layer of oxide , etc. , under hexane and then cut it into small pieces with scissors . Allow the pieces to fall into the solvent to be used for the reaction . // A slight excess ( about 5% ) of RX should in general be used . Prepare 3 g. lithium as above and drop into 100 ml. sodium-dried ether contained in a three-neck flask fitted with stirrer , condenser and dropping funnel . This reaction should be carried out in an atmosphere of dry nitrogen . Place a solution of 35.5 g. bromobenzene in 75 ml. ether in the funnel and add it slowly , with moderate stirring , so as to maintain a steady reflux of ether . Continue until nearly all the lithium has dissolved .

Add a little water to hydrolyze the reaction product and then oxidize it by the addition of a 0.2% solution of iodine in glacial acetic acid . A blue to green colour indicates the presence of phenyl ? lithium . ( Write out the reaction scheme . ) If the reaction mixture under test contains a product which reacts with iodine , a correspondingly larger amount of the latter will need to be added . 11.6 Preparation of some Phenyl-Tin Compounds Prepare Ph3Sn , Li as below and use it to carry out the subsequent reactions , working under dry nitrogen . 1 .

Does the reaction of pentaphenyl-antimony and chlorine lead to similar products to those of exercise 2 ? // III . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phosphine and its Complex with Nickel Chloride Organic phosphines and arsines are amongst the most valuable types of ligand available for metal-complex chemistry . Mono- and bi dentate types are in common use whilst tri- and tetra-dentate ligands are occasionally employed , being particularly useful for forcing an unusual stereochemistry on a metal atom in a given valence state , e.g. , the tetra-arsine , **34;899;TOOLONG , can be used to make five-coordinate platinum(n) ( Proc . Chem . Soc. , 1961 , 170 ) . In this experiment you prepare an organic phosphine and use it to form a complex . Phosphines are unstable to oxygen and all operations should therefore be carried out under nitrogen . Organic phosphines may be destroyed by an oxidizing agent such as bromine water . SAFETY NOTE Phosphines have a penetrating and un pleasant odour and are poisonous . The vapour can be smelt in very low concentration and this acts as an excellent in dicator of the effectiveness of the safety precautions . Clearly , the whole process must be carried out in an efficient fume cupboard . When handling the liquid product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished the experiment as liquid phosphines are contact-poisons . Choice of conditions The best yields of phosphines are obtained if the entire preparation is carried out under nitrogen . This is a somewhat cumbersome business and requires the construction of a certain amount of non-standard glassware . Many of the commonly used phosphines ( PPr3 , PBu3 , PPhEt2 , for example ) are sufficiently insensitive to oxygen that they can be handled quickly in air , or under a blanket of nitrogen . We describe here a general procedure for the preparation of // phenyldiethylphosphine , PPhEt2 , entirely under nitrogen , on a two-litre-flask scale . Using this procedure two to three working days are required for the preparation of approximately 80 g. of pure product . This may be too long for many teaching purposes . By cutting the scale down to ( say ) 500 ml. and carrying out all the transfer opera-tions in standard apparatus flushed as far as possible with nitrogen , considerable speeding up may be effected . Indeed , the crude product may be used directly for the formation of complexes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same general procedure may be used for the preparation of other mono-phosphines . Procedure ( i ) Assemble the apparatus of figure 11.3 ; lubricate the joints with silicone grease . Charge the flask with 31.7 g. magnesium turnings . Pass a fast stream of nitrogen through the apparatus for about 20 min. whilst rotating the stirrer at a moderate speed ( N.B. a mechanically sealed stirrer gland should be used , not a mercury-sealed type , as the apparatus will be subjected to some pressure ) . Then reduce the flow and maintain at about one bubble per second throughout the preparation . Run in 200 ml. ether and then about 1 ml. ethyl bromide . Drop a few crystals of iodine into the local concentration of bromide and warm the flask with the heat of the hand . When the colour of iodine begins to be discharged , start the stirrer and add 99 ml. ethyl bromide dissolved in 150 ml. ether over half an hour . Keep the temperature at 25-30 ? c by slight cooling from a solid carbon dioxide-acetone bath . Add 200 ml. ether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if desired , provided slow stirring and passage of nitrogen is continued . Cool the reaction mixture to ? 45 ? c and stir vigorously . Add 80 ml. commercial phenyldichlorophosphine , PPhC12 , * in 200 ml. ether dropwise over half an hour . During the addition the mixture becomes much more viscous and a white solid separates . This must be kept from settling on the sides of the flask by vigorous stirring and by applying the least cooling necessary to keep the temperature at - 45 ? c . When addition is complete , allow the mixture to warm to 0 ? c. ( ii ) Hydrolyze by addition of 280 g. ammonium chloride in 1080 ml. oxygen-free water ( boil out under nitrogen ) , beginning slowly and adding the last 400 ml. as rapidly as possible . Stir throughout and // maintain a fast stream of nitrogen . Warm to 25 ? c and then stop the stirrer . Syphon the ether layer into the filtering apparatus as follows . Remove the thermometer from the flask and insert the syphon tube against a fast flow of nitrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flask , thereby forcing the ether layer into the filter apparatus , which has been previously flushed with nitrogen . Wash the aqueous layer with two portions of 100 ml. ether and syphon over . Take off any aqueous layer that may have come over and then run the ether solution into two one-litre conical flasks , each containing 100 g. anhydrous sodium sulphate and flushed with nitrogen prior to // filling . Close the flasks with rubber bungs and seal with adhesive tape . Stand overnight . ( iii ) Meanwhile , assemble the apparatus of figure 11.4 and drop a few chips of porcelain into the flask . Lag the Vigreux column with cotton-wool before fitting the large dropping funnel . Prepare a nitrogen capillary leak and check that it fits into the distilling flask : store it in a safe place . Flush the entire apparatus with a fast stream of nitrogen for about i hr. , close off , and leave overnight . Transfer the dry phosphine ? ether solution from the flasks to the filter apparatus by quickly attaching to the delivery tube and pressurizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ether . Adjust nitrogen flows and then distil off the ether at a steady rate at atmospheric pressure using an oil bath . Pass a fast stream of nitrogen through the nitrogen by-pass attached to the take-off head and remove the large dropping funnel . Quickly insert the nitrogen capillary leak . Adjust nitrogen flows so that gas is passed in via the leak and evacuate the apparatus by means of a water pump . Vacuum should be applied carefully as ether dissolved in the crude phosphino will froth considerably . Raise the
