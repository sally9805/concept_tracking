txt Congress wants to help its native poor but it nrobablv wo n't dare to . That is the major finding of this newspaper 's random sampling of Senate and House opinion on the plight of men of modest means in public office . Most of the 18 members interviewed spoke with unusual candor about what some call " the debt set . " At times their words paralleled the despairing recent testimony of Sen. Thomas J. Dodd ( D ) of Connecticut before the Senate Select Committee on Standards and Conduct . " I needed the money , " Senator Dodd had told the committee in explaining his reliance on fund-raising testimonial dinners . However , those members contacted failed to approve the use of testimonial contributions for any other reason than repaying campaign debts . Salary boosts recalled In fact , Rep. Lucien N. Nedzi ( D ) of Michigan has filed a bill to outlaw the use of testimonial funds for personal use . A second Nedzi bill would make every gift of more than $25 taxable " to avoid this ruse that testimonial donors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress now earn $30,000 a year , a sizable boost from the $22,500 paid them a few years back and the $15,000 salary they received in the mid-1950 's . But most lawmakers  --  and especially the new , younger ones ? find this wage barely enough to subsist . " I ca n't see hope of anybody 's putting any savings away , " Rep. Speedy 0 . Long ( D ) of Louisiana declared . " You spend your first year in office trying to pay off your debts and the second year spending it salary all over again for the campaign . " Rep. Eligio de la Garza ( D ) of Texas says he just makes ends meet . " We had more money in the bank when I was in Texas practicing law  --  even though I earned a lot less , " Mr. de la Garza maintains . " We 've had to scrimp , " admits Rep. Silvio 0 . Conte ( R ) of Massachusetts . " We live modestly with old furniture . We need things , but we 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) of California insists that a $16,000 salary would go as far in his Riverside district as the $30,000 a year does in Washington , all due to the nature of the job . Rep. Rogers C. B. Morton ( R ) of Maryland agrees : " About $10,000 is par for the year for extraordinary expenses . They could go as high as $15,000 . " Point illustrated The case of Rep. James C. Wright Jr . ( D ) of Texas , a seven-term House member , illustrates the point . The Fort Worth lawmaker figures that his net worth has declined $74,000 since 1952 when he served as Mayor of Weatherford , Texas . He took his seat in Congress two years later . " I 'm not singing the blues , " Mr. Wright says . " I 've always wanted to be a member of Congress . If things get too tough , of course , I can always get out .

Mr. Wright 's costs ? as a member of Congress and as father of four  --  disposed of all that income , even though he faced no serious campaign costs . He gives this estimated breakdown of his years 's expenses : Schooling ( one son in college ) $3,660 Housing ( in Fort Worth and Washington ) - 1,750 Travel ( to and from his district ) 2,500 Entertainment ( lunches and dinners ) 1,750 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newsletter to district voters 3,000 Dry cleaning 600 Gas , oil , water , electricity 1,500 Telephone 400 Medical and drug 840 Sums given to charities Mr. Wright also gave generous sums to Charities , lodges , and his church , he said . He declined to estimate the amount in dollars . However , the total costs , when added to daily incidental spending , still prevent the Texas lawmaker from breaking even . And he is not an isloated case . " Plenty of members are in hock up to their ears , " an aide of Rep. Ogden R. Reid ( R ) of New York asserts . The congressman proposes to do something about it . Allowances given to House and Senate members include an average of $67,000 for a representative 's staff , $160,000 average for a senator . Both figures vary with population of the district or state . A maximum of $2,400 is allowed both Senate and House members for office space in their home states provided they are unable to obtain rent-free space in federal buildings . For official expenses incurred in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Travel allowance for a House member to and from each regular session of Congress is 20 cents a mile plus reimbursement for four other round trips a year . A senator is allowed 20 cents a mile plus reimbursement for six round trips a year . Other allowances noted Both House and Senate members are allowed $2,400 a year for stationery . For postage a House member is allowed free first-class mail and $500 a year for air mail and special delivery . ? A senator is allowed free first-class mail and $800 a year for senators from states east of the Mississippi and $1,000 for Senators from states west of the Mississippi for air mail and special delivery . For telegrams and long-distance phone calls a House member is allowed 100,000 communication units during each term of office ( one minute on the telephone equals four units ; one word in a telegram equals one unit ) . A senator is allowed 200 official long-distance calls a year to and from Washington aggregating not more than 1,000 minutes a month ; $2,200 a year for other official long-distance calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scion of a well-to-do family , wants to again increase members ' salaries to $50,000 . He also seeks more liberal travel allowances and a subsidy for members who must maintain two residences . The Reid bills form a package designed to end dependence on special-interest groups . Due to the public uproar over the Adam Clayton Powell and , to a far lesser extent , the Dodd affairs , however , Congress regards these measure warily . " This is the wrong time , " Mr. Conte mused last week . " The public is aroused and rightfully so . I 'm upset , too . If I have a chance to vote against a salary increase , I will . " Other members also felt the wage proposal was ill-timed . They gave qualified support to a housing allowance , an increased tax deduction ( members may declare $3,000 nontaxable as a " cost-of-living " deduction ) and more generous travel benefits . " The subsidies are n't adequate , " Sen. Robert P. Griffin ( R ) of Michigan said , " but they 're as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D ) of Ohio , noted for his blunt letters to political critics , disregards much of the talk about indebtedness . " It 's an untruthful statement , " the Senator said flatly . " A member of Congress can live very comfortably . He can enjoy gracious living in good surroundings . " Many members , of course , gain a sizable side income from law practices , business investments , or real-estate holdings . Senator Young cited the examples of Sens . Gale W. McGee ( D ) of Wyoming and Eugene J. McCarthy ( D ) of Minnesota , both former college professors who , he said , ' had entered the Senate with meager savings . " I assert that this talk is an affront to men of modest circumstances  --  men like Senators McGee and McCarthy  --  and the people they represent , " Senator Young retorted . A House member conceded that many senior members share Senator Young 's views . The source expects little help from this quarter . " The old-timers are fairly resistant , " he said . " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem willing to help the younger members . " Another junior member in the House noted : " Eventually you should hold your own . You get a better credit rating with seniority . " Still another House member voiced the same optimism : " I have n't saved a cent in five years , " he stated , " but I see daylight ahead . If you can develop a campaign kitty , it 's not the same grind . " Sen. Gordon Allott ( R ) of Colorado admits that the meager margin between pay and expenses " keeps us sailing pretty tight . " But he also contends that the variance between a member who shows modest savings and one who claims deep indebtedness lies with each individual . " A friend of mine , " he said , " told me when I was first elected to the Senate : Gordon , you 'll leave this place dead broke . ' I told him I would n't if I had to pitch a tent on the White House lawn . " The Senate takes its toll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , social obligations , and , in the Allott family , the recent added burden of supporting two sons in college . " By living frugally , " Senator Allott said , " we manage to save a little . But if it had n't been for the two increases in pay , I never could have hacked it .
