THE FUTILE LIFE OF PITO PEREZ by Jos Rubn Romero , translated by William O. Cord . 151 pages . Prentice-Hall. $4.95 . <P> <P> On the eve of World War II , a scandalous , enigmatic fictional scamp named Pito Perez suddenly loomed on the Mexican literary landscape . He was modeled after a real-life picaresque oddball named Jess Prez Gaona , and was immediately hailed as a personification of the national character . Bloody , absurd , splendid , his story seemed to mirror Mexico . The Futile Life of Pito Perez - his equivalent U.S. name would be something like Penny Whistle Jones-was not so much an instant bestseller as an immediate national classic . Its author , Jos Rubn Romero , became a figure of renown* But strangely , until now , Pito remained untranslated . <P> Pito 's Penance . Who is he , really ? The Don Quixote of his country ? He lacks the illusions of the gaga grandee ; besides , he is his own Sancho Panza , and he does n't own a horse . One thing is certain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , but a foundling foster brother got most of the milk . It was the same with his first crime-robbing the church poor box . A confederate got the pesos and Pito got the penance . " My life , " he says , " is a sad one , like that of all cheats . But I have seen people laugh so often at my sorrow that I have ended up laughing at it myself . " <P> When he is not laughing , he is puzzling over the difference between what he is told and what he painfully finds out about the way things really are . As set down with disarming simplicity by Romero , Pito 's story is " the dialogue between a poet and a madman . " His travels with what he calls his " prodigious flute , " a pipe whittled from bamboo , lead him all through the state of Michoacan and always take him back to the village of Santa Clara del Cobre , his bitterly loved and hated birthplace . <P> Lear 's Fool . No one follows this pie-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithful companion is the skeleton of a woman , the least troublesome kind of female from his point of view . In every town he knows the jails , the madhouses , the cantinas and the churches . He wears rags sewn with tiny bells , each of which tinkles a note that in his mind symbolizes the special vice of each place he has visited . He is a spy , and his roguish capacity for survival unites him with Ulysses , Tom Jones and Huckleberry Finn . Yet Pito remains the faithful son of both Catholicism and the anticlerical tenets of the Mexican Revolution . At his most sacrilegious , he testifies to the faith ; at his antisocial worst , he demonstrates that the republic offers the good life to its citizens . He reassures the Catholic , the republican and the mestizo ; he is no atheist who would destroy the church or anarchist who would destroy the state . Like Lear 's Fool , he demonstrates the madness of the King , but neither would nor could leave his service . <P> Should Mexicans ever send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own country , the missionaries will certainly carry in their saddlebags The Futile Life of Pito Perez . Meanwhile , Pito should be pressed into the hands of any tourists , State Department types or oilmen whose duties call them from the confident certitudes of U.S. life into the philosophical complexities that lie south of the border . <P>
