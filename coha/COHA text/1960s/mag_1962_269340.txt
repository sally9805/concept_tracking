LETTERS OF JAMES AGEE TO FATHER FLYE ( 235 pp. ) - Brazlller ( $5 ) . <P> When James Agee died of a heart attack in a New York taxicab at the age of 45 , he was already something of a legend . The legend partly derived from the very fact that he was so little known and had written so little outside of his critical and journalistic work . His admirers cherished him like a shared secret . <P> In fact , Agee 's best work was published after his death . A Death in the Family is a classic in the American tradition of evoked childhood ; it won the Pulitzer Prize and has since been made into a play . He also , although probably he did not know it , left a lifetime of yellowing letters in the hands of the man who buried him , Father James Flye , now on summer parish duty at St. Luke 's Chapel in New York 's Greenwich Village . <P> Angel 's Talent . Agee met Father Flye at St. Andrew 's School near Sewanee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then called ) went shortly after the death of his own father . To the teacher-priest , Rufus seemed a sort of wonderful , shy , gifted hillbilly . For once the priestly vocation and the artist 's vocation-often hostile in direction-met in understanding . Few sons have written to their natural fathers as James Agee wrote to Father Flye . Such trust , love and the confidence in being understood seldom surmount the walls of consanguinity . The letters are also a vivid portrait of the artist as a young man-for Agee remained a young man to the day of his death , with all a young man 's prodigal energies and frustrated intentions . In his introduction , Critic Robert Phelps calls Agee " a born , sovereign prince of the English language . " But the letters proved in a sad way , that the language was his sovereign . Agee had an angel 's talent , and he wrestled all his life to bring it to earth . <P> The letters begin with the boy 's notes from Phillips Exeter , where young Rufus had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geste , Elizabeth and Her German Garden , finding Sinclair Lewis " turning rancid ' ' in Elmer Gantry , moving on to the discovery of the " terrific " Ernest Hemingway ( who does , however , earn a boy 's stern moral disapproval as " one of the crowd of degenerate Americans who settled . . . in Paris after the war " ) . Dreiser 's English is " bum , " and John Dos Passos rouses a boy 's puritanism with the " unalleviatedly filthy " Manhattan Transfer . <P> Beauty in Slop Jars . Such is his rare candor to his elder confidant that he is able to confess the first signs in himself of a troubled spirit , " feeling inexplicably like crying or biting into something or beating it with my fists . " Also , while still a schoolboy , he salutes the first intimations of his special vision of life , " feeling the beauty of everything , not excluding slop jars and foetuses-and a feeling of love for everything-and now I 've run into Walt Whitman-and it seems as if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . .
