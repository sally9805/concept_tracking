Once upon a time , Americans were just Republicans , Democrats , Elks or Masons . Now they back ACTION ( American Council to Improve Our Neighborhoods ) and CARE ( Cooperative for American Relief Everywhere ) and SHARE ( Share Happily and Reap Endlessly ) and TOPS ( Take Off Pounds Sensibly ) . Unionists support COPE ( Committee on Political Education ) . Negroes support CORE ( Congress of Racial Equality ) . In Little Rock , moderates stayed on the school board through STOP ( Stop This Outrageous Purge ) . In New Orleans , they faced up to integration with SOS ( Save Our Schools ) . In Atlanta this fall , moderates will do likewise through HOPE ( Help Our Public Education ) and OASIS ( Organizations Assisting Schools in September ) - if they can outwit GUTS ( Georgians Unwilling to Surrender ) . <P> WAIF &; SAFE . H. L. Mencken called attention to the native U.S. talent for " reducing complex concepts to starkest abbreviations . " From O.K. to K.O. , Americans have long coined initial-born words . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smog ( smoke and fog ) . Just to describe the new rash of alphabetease , linguists were forced to invent a new word : acronym ( from the Greek akros for tip , onyma for name ) , which first appeared in dictionaries in 1947 . Most insidious breeders are public relations experts , adept at spawning the punch word that sums up an organization , then , to fit its letters , turning out an often fatuous full title . Examples : WAIF ( Women 's Adoption International Fund ) and the recently launched piggyback acronym YOU ( Youth Out for UNICEF ) . Last week Mississippi segregationists coined yet another : SAFE , meaning Southern Action for Expansion . <P> More blight than bright , the new acronyms are a kind of regression . They do not really enrich the language because they are words already . Still , they cap a fine old tradition that probably began with the Romans ' SPQR ( Senatus Populusque Romanus ) . Britons in the 19th century , for example , contributed posh ( port out , starboard home ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Acronyms first picked up speed in World War I with such coinages as Anzac , for Australia and New Zealand Army Corps , AWOL , for absent without official leave , and asdic ( Allied Submarine Detection Investigation Committee ) , which eventually led to the development of sonar ( sound navigation ranging ) . <P> <P> Dear Little Nira . U.S. companies were meanwhile calling themselves Alcoa ( Aluminum Co. of America ) or Nabisco ( National Biscuit Co. ) or Socony ( Standard Oil Co. of New York ) . After the advent of Basic ( British American Scientific International Commercial ) English , acronyms faltered in favor of the New Deal 's AAA , CCC , TVA , WPA , led by F.D.R. himself . Indeed , legend has it that the death of the National Industrial Recovery Act ( ruled unconstitutional ) left bereft of rhyme or reason a host of Depression-born U.S. girls named Nira.
