Winemakers in Reims , Epernay , Tours-sur-Marne and other towns in the Champagne district of France last week observed a familiar three-century tradition . In antiseptic rooms , committees of tasters eyed , sniffed and sipped six-month-old white wine , neatly spit out each taste into marble basins . Testing 25 to 45 varieties , they matched the acidity of one with the sweetness of another , the weakness of one with another 's strong alcoholic body . When they were done , the formula had been arrived at by which such famous champagne houses as Krug , Mumm , Mot et Chandon and Pol Roger will blend their 1965 product . <P> Sunlight &; Rain . The ' 65 champagne , because of a scarcity of sunlight and excess of rain during the grape-growing season , will not be a great vintage product . Nevertheless , for the sixth year in a row , France 's 140 champagne makers will set a record in production and sales . In all , last year , they sold 78.6 million bottles worth $200 million . <P> Champagne companies think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , but the way is changing . The wine is still aged , bubbled in the course of a second fermentation in the bottle just as Benedictine Monk Dom Perignon did it in the 17th century . But large champagne companies have now air-conditioned their fermentation rooms , automated their packing lines and replaced wooden vats with 500-gallon , glass-lined tanks . They have also begun to sell their wine in French food shops , where the return is greater than it would be from sales overseas . " We were shy about selling in French supermarkets and piceries , " says Mumm Executive Jean Couvreur , " but we find that it does n't hurt our image at all . " <P> The Avant-Garde . Supermarket availability at home has helped establish another trend : Frenchmen now drink more champagne than ever , last year bought 58.2 million bottles , or three-quarters of the output . The bigger champagne producers , however , are still leary about putting all their bottles in one basket , and they continue to cultivate the export market . Britain remains the biggest foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. is a fast-growing second , with 3,478,522 bottles . French champagne makers are unworried over competition from U.S. wines . " They are our avant-garde , " says Robert Jean de Vog , head of Mot et Chandon . " When people come to appreciate wine , they will appreciate French champagne . " The French companies do resent the fact that U.S. makers are permitted to label their product champagne . In England and on the Continent , only wine from the actual Champagne district-35,000 acres on either bank of the lazy Marne River-can legally be labeled champagne .
