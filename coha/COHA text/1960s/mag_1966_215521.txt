The idea was first formally introduced in a book in 1608 . Ninety years later , having mulled it over , Sir Christopher Wren guessed he was for it . In 1854 , Gladstone said : " I can not doubt it would be of immense advantage , " but he decided not to make undue haste . In following decades came a select parliamentary committee , a royal commission , a Paris conference , three colonial conferences , and most recently a special committee of inquiry , all primarily devoted to the subject . Last week , after 358 years of careful thought , the British government formally announced its intention to decimalize the pound . Instead of consisting of 240 pennies ( each worth 1.18 U.S. cents ) , as it does now , the pound will be divided into 100 new pennies ( worth 2.8 cents ) . <P> Unchanged . For years British schoolchildren have chanted , " Twelve pence make a shilling ; 20 shillings make a pound , " and the system they were straining to learn is as dismal as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a 3 3s 3d roast beef could take a man to the edge of starvation . The system had at least one advantage : it had practically always been that way . The pound and penny first appeared about the time of King Offa in the 8th century . They were originally named for the Roman libra and denarius ( hence the still used signs of and d ) , but the libra eventually evolved into the pound , because it was worth that weight in silver . Similarly , it took 240 pennies to make a pound because that was the number of pennies that weighed a pound. * Shillings joined Offa 's awful system in the 16th century , and that basically formed the current currency setup-though such denominations as the florin ( 2 shillings ) , half crown ( 2 shillings ) , guinea ( 21 shillings ) and sovereign ( approximately 3 guineas ) came along at various times . <P> To the relief of accountants , schoolchildren , tourists and moneymen , all such variations will officially disappear with decimalization . They will be replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pennies ) , a penny , a twopence piece , a 5-pence piece , a 10-pence piece and a 50-pence piece ( worth , like the current 10-shilling note , half a pound ) . The pound will remain but the decimal system means that a price will be written as 3.33 . The sum can then be converted to dollars , simply by multiplying by 2.8 , and the simplification may cut bookkeeping time by an estimated 30% . <P> The new system will cost something too . Manufacturers of such items as cash registers , adding machines and any coin-operated machines will not be subsidized , may well incur $224 million in conversion costs . The government itself expects to spend $134 million minting 9 billion new coins . It will also mount a $3,000,000 public-education program to help decimal haters like Winston Churchill 's father , Lord Randolph Churchill , who claimed , " I never could make out what those damn dots meant . " There will be plenty of time to learn , however : the changeover will not be for another four leisurely years-in February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pound as a British weight measure was replaced by the stone ( 14 Ibs. ) , but that is another story ( TIME , June 4 , 1965 ) .
