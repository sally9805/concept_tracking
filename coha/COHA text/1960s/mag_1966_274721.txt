Much of the news and photographs coming out of Viet Nam last week dealt with some veteran troupers - rather than troops . Playing to as many as 15,000 men in Pleiku and Cam Ranh Bay , Comic Bob Hope marked his 25th year entertaining U.S. servicemen in the field with some well-received variations on well-known routines . Sample : " You Catholics will be glad to know you can now eat Spam on Fridays . " Traveling much the same circuit during his first Viet Nam visit , Evangelist Billy Graham was astounded at the size of his turnouts . When 2,500 G.I.s showed up to hear him at Long Binh , 13 miles from Saigon , he said : " Somebody must have told you Bob Hope was coming . " <P> Weary U.S. troops found the change more than welcome , for two less martial men than Hope and Graham can scarcely be imagined . The fact that they could challenge the war for attention was evidence that the fighting had slacked off even before this week 's formal 48-hour Christmas truce went into effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to extend the lull into a permanent ceasefire . <P> Greetings from Ho . U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Arthur Goldberg presented Secretary-General U Thant with a letter urging him to " take whatever steps you consider necessary to bring about the necessary discussions which could lead to such a cease-fire . " The letter represented no change in U.S. policy but , to underscore Washington 's determination to explore all avenues to peace , Secretary of State Dean Rusk announced that the U.S. would give Thant " maximum latitude " in his diplomatic probes-which presumably meant admitting the Viet Cong to any peace talks . In his annual Christmas message , Pope Paul VI stressed that " good will holds the key to peace , " but added pointedly : " The difficulty is that the responsible authorities of the two sides must make use of this key at the same time . " <P> This , of course , is what Dean Rusk has been saying all along : that a little " reciprocity " is required from Ho Chi Minh and his colleagues if talks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to send a holiday message to the American people , expressing " cordial wishes for peace and happiness , " but at the same time blasting U.S. leaders for waging a " criminal war . " <P> Ho 's reaction underscores the difficulty of ever getting the Communists to any conference table . In fact , an increasing number of experts think that the war could end without any formal negotiations at all . Writing in the current Foreign Affairs , former Presidential Adviser McGeorge Bundy , now president of the Ford Foundation , speculates that the Communists may quietly call it quits once they become convinced that U.S. power and perseverance will deny them victory . " If the Communists do decide that their present purposes exceed their capacity , " says Bundy , " may they not prefer a private decision to a public admission ? "
