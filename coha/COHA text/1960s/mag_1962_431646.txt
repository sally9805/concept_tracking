 | A Swift , Sure Way to Take Off Weight @# IN HIGH SCHOOL Gerald Ball stood six-feet-three and weighed 236 pounds . In college , playing football and eating at the training table , where no second helpings were pertmitted , he kept his weight at 235 . But ten years later he weighed 300 pounds , and in another ten years , though he had tried various reducing programs , 365 . " When I see food I have no will power , " he said . He knew he had to do something . But what ? At this point , in March 196o , Ball entered Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia for one more try . There I ) r . Garfield Duncan and his associates were taking what seemed to be drastic measures for overweight sufferers : total deprivation of food for ten days . For ten days Ball got nothing but water , tea , coffee and vitamins . He was hungry for the first two days . Then his craving disappeared ; he simply lost all appetite for food . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days he lost 25 pounds . Since then , in 27 months , Ball has undergone three more fasts at the hospital and periodic two-day abstentions on his own . He has lost 93 pounds , almost a pound a week . Overweight also had been a problem for Helen Semmes . Five-feet-  | three-inches tall , she weighed 219 as a teen-ager . Painfully embarrassed about her heft , she had tried virtually every kind of reducing method , but at 63 she weighed over 300 . " I have lost hope , " she said when she entered Pennsylvania Hospital . Low-calorie diets had always been torture for Helen . They made her ill-tempered and dizzy . But now at the hospital , on no calories at all , she got the surprise of her life . She did n't suffer , even on the first day . " I knew I had n't eaten , " she admitted later . " But there was no anguish . " In ten days she went from 303 pounds to 277 . Fourteen months later , after four more fasts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some 6o others who have gone on total fasts under Dr. Duncan 's direction promises a safe , dependable way to take off fat when other methods wo n't work . Dramatic results , painlessly achieved , give the overweight person fresh confidence and help lead him back to a balanced diet of caloric content sufficient to meet his needs . Dr. Duncan , director of the Division of Medicine at the Pennsylvania Hospital , staff member at the Benjamin Franklin Clinic in Philadelphia and professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , is a specialist in the control of diabetes . He has been interested in overweight for many years . As editor of the journal Metabolism , he received an article three years ago from Dr. Walter L. Bloom , of Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta , who had used fasting as a preliminary treatment for nine overweight patients . What struck Dr. Duncan 's attention was Dr. Bloom 's observation that his fasters did not mind the deprivation . Dr. Duncan decided to give fasting a try . Selecting patients for the experiment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all the usual methods . These people had been put on 500- to 1500-calorie diets ? which they had not kept up . All had taken drugs to reduce appetite ( the drugs were effective in most cases for only two or three days , then lost effect ) . Dr. Duncan insisted that they enter the hospital , where they could be carefully observed . He gave them polyvitamins in therapeutic amounts . They stayed in the hospital from five to 14 days . They were weighed each day , and urinalysis and blood tests were made . Results were dramatic . Persons on low-calorie diets often go for ten days or more with little or no difference on the scales , because their body has retained water . But on a total fast , the water-retaining mechanism ; apparently does not work , and the faster sees his improvement registered on the scales immediately . Loss of a pound and a half to two pounds a day at first is usual . This exceeds what would be expected on the basis of caloric expenditure . Added to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the fact that it is coming off without causing most of the 1962 A SWIFT , SURE WAY TO TAKE OFF WEIGHT r , ;  | patients hunger pangs . One man said , " After that first period ? which for most people lasts only a day ? you 've got it made . " Said another , " When you 're fasting , you 're a little like a bear hibernating . You can talk , and walk about the hospital , but you generally spend most of the time in complete rest . " ( Without food you tire easily . ) Why do n't you get hungry ? Dr. Duncan discovered the answer to this question , and thereby made a significant contribution to the study of weight : hunger is lessened by the production of ketones , a kind of mild acidosis , in the faster 's bloodstream . Blood-serum tests of patients showed that for the first 24 to 48 hours there was no significant ketone level ? and the faster was hungry . When the tests showed an elevation in the ketone concentration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor can tell whether a person has broken his fast simply by taking a blood-serum test for the ketones . Many persons wanted to stay on the fast even after 14 days , but Dr. Duncan wanted to be sure there were no unexpected ill effects . He sent them home on 900- to 1500-calorie diets , which usually exceeded their desire for food for several days . They did not continue to lose weight , however ; in fact , many gained a little . As appetites increased , the caloric intake increased as well . This gain , Dr. Duncan and his associates found , could be corrected by one- or two-day fasts at appropriate intervals at the patient 's home . Fasting for other than weight-reduction purposes is an honored and ancient practice . The Old and New Testaments mention it 74 times . Christ fasted 4o days and 4o nights . In Islam there is the universally observed 3o-day , sunup-to-sundown fast of Ramadan , and Buddhists find fasting appropriate to their way of contemplation and asceticism . The most renowned faster of modern times was Mahatma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of India engaged in 15 fasts , three of them lasting 21 days . He usually had no sustenance but hot water , sometimes with lime juice . Although he grew so weak at times that he could not lift a glass , he remained mentally alert , and there is no evidence that he suffered any lasting ill effects . Perhaps the most carefully observed forbearance from eating was that of A. Levanzin , a lawyer and publisher in Malta , who believed that fasting had cured him , his wife and their two children of serious illnesses . In 1912 he came to the Carnegie Institution in Boston and submitted himself to a 31-day study . Levanzin , who was five-feet-seveninches tall and weighed 134 , lived under closest scrutiny day and night , existing on nothing but distilled water . A retinue of specialists made daily tests and observations of his physical condition , his subjective impressions and mental attitude . As he himself had predicted , Lev- anzin had no sensation of hunger , and no desire for food . He experienced no abdominal pain nor discomfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscular fatigue , but on the 14th he ran down a flight of stairs without difficulty . His memory , tested daily , was as good at the end as at the beginning . A year later , to see whether he had suffered in any way from his long self-denial , Levanzin was put through the same tests . He did as well or better on nearly all of them . Said his examiners , " It is an indisputable fact that , according to the tests , there was no lasting evil effect of the fast , either upon muscular strength or mental activity . " Today 's fasters at Pennsylvania Hospital are enthusiastic about the results of their experience ; but Dr. Duncan warns sharply against anyone attempting an unsupervised fast . Total fasting can be dangerous for women in pregnancy , and for anyone suffering from peptic ulcer , malfunctioning liver , or infection . Most fasters do feel weak and should have at least their first fast in a hospital under a doctor 's care . " Complete fasts , though remark . ably effective in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Duncan said at a recent meeting of the Amer. ican Medical Association , " are not to be used indiscriminately . Like surgery or potent drugs , they are to be employed with a high degree of selection and never without close and qualified supervision . " How do fasters fare after several months ? Records kept on 57 patients show that after two years 37 have maintained their reduced weight level or continued to lose . Ten have gained back some poundage but weigh less than before the fast ; the other ten have gone back to previous weight , or more . Considering that no other program had helped any of the 57 , this record speaks well for fasting . One overweight doctor who was among the 57 says , " This is a good way to get the ball rolling . After the fast , it 's easier to embark on a longrange plan we can live with , taking just enough food for our daily needs . " @#                 @ @ @ @
