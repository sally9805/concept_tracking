From either end of a long table in the auditorium of New Jersey 's Seton Hall University , the two men sat glowering at each other . " It 's an abuse of academic freedom to make such irresponsible , seditious statements , " cried State Senator Wayne Dumont Jr. , the Republican candidate for Governor Rejoined Democratic Governor Richard J. Hughes : " There are federal statutes against treason and sedition a complex of laws and courts , and ' an FBI to protect the nation . " Then , when the debate was over , the protagonists stalked off separately without so much as a word or a handshake . <P> What had treason , sedition and academic freedom to do with New Jersey 's gubernatorial race ? Everything . Until July , Candidate Dumont , 51 , a state-tax expert and attorney , and Incumbent Hughes , 56 , an affable , undistinguished administrator who is seeking a second four-year term , had almost nothing to argue about . Both agreed that New Jersey 's most pressing problem , a chronic shortage of revenue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey and Nebraska are the only two states in the Union that do not levy statewide taxes on income or retail sales . ) Nor did the candidates electrify the populace with pleas for purer water , cleaner air , faster transit facilities . <P> A Jersey Dreyfus . Then , suddenly Dumont raised the issue of Eugene Genovese , 35 , an American-history professor at Rutgers , New Jersey 's state university . A short time before , Genovese had stood up at a campus teach-in to protest the war in Viet Nam . " I am a Marxist and a socialist , " he declared . " Therefore , I do not fear or regret the impending Viet Cong victory in Viet Nam . I welcome it . " <P> With that , the campaign caught fire . Dumont demanded that Genovese be dismissed or suspended , called on Hughes to join him in the ouster call . Hughes refused , siding loftily with Voltaire rather than Genovese , and forthwith nailed academic freedom into his platform . At Hughes 's request , Rutgers ' board of governors conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incur dismissal , and upheld his right to free speech . Nevertheless , the Genovese case turned into the Jersey equivalent of the Dreyfus affair . <P> Before the Family . Before a group of Princeton residents , the Governor angrily branded the injection of Genovese into the campaign as " the act of a desperate candidate making a cheap political issue out of free speech . " Retorted Dumont : " We have 140,000 men in Viet Nam dodging bullets , and Genovese 's views can only be achieved by killing Americans there . This is a question not of academic freedom but of academic license . " <P> The Governor accused the G.O P candidate of Goldwaterism and " vampire politics , " protested as a low blow his opponent 's suggestion that he should defend Genovese before the family of a boy killed in Viet Nam . Campaigning in a chartered light plane , Dumont-who in fact opposed Goldwater 's nomination in 1964-charged Hughes with the lowest , dirtiest , and most contemptible utterances . " Said he : " I did n't know that $35,000 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
