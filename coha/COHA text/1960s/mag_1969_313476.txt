Britain 's National Health Service offers free medical care from cradle to grave , but increasing numbers of Britons fear they may be in their graves before they reach the end of the interminable queues for services . Seeking an alternative , 2,000,000 Britons now pay for additional private medical insurance . The number has doubled in ten years , and private insurers predict that 5,000,000 people , a tenth of the population of England and Wales , will eventually be covered by their policies . <P> For this fiscal year the cost of the distressed Health Service is estimated at $4.5 billion , more than 5% of the national income . But N.H.S . has far too much to do and too little money , facilities and manpower . Almost half of the 2,500 N.H.S . hospitals in England and Wales were built before 1891 . Despite a $615 million building program , many patients will continue to be hospitalized in converted 19th century workhouses for years to come . <P> Often , their patience is sorely tried . There are more people on the N.H.S . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds ( 468,000 ) . Genuine emergencies get prompt attention , but the average delay for a tonsillectomy is 22 weeks , and many patients must wait a year for other elective surgery . <P> Two-Way Benefits . For these reasons , Britons are turning to the private alternative . When a patient pays his own bills , he can set the date for his operation and count on getting the surgeon he wants . He will recuperate not in a bustling ward but in one of the 4,398 private beds that N.H.S . sets aside in its hospitals for those willing to pay . He may also receive as many visitors as he wants ; in an N.H.S . ward the limit is two at a time for an hour a day . Many privately insured patients undergo operations at the expense of N.H.S. , then convalesce in paid-for comfort in one of its private rooms or at a private hospital or nursing home . <P> By providing attractive services , Britain 's three private medical insurers have developed a booming business . The largest , British United Provident Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine different hospitalization plans to its 1,500,000 members , and now takes in $30 million a year . Like the two other private firms , the company offers coverage for private medical care , hospitalization , nursing and surgical services . <P> Every British jobholder pays a weekly N.H.S . tax of 46 per man , 38 per woman and 26 per child . The added expense of private coverage , a minimum of $58 a year for a family of three to a top of about $166 , once made it accessible to only a small minority . No longer . Roughly 70% of Provident 's recent business has come from company group policies . Once limited to top executives , these policies are being extended to more and more employees . <P> Despite the growth of private medical care , the 21-year-old National Health Service is in no danger of extinction . There have been bitter complaints ( most recently over increased charges for false teeth and eyeglasses and imposition of a 30 prescription fee ) , but the British know that the program has served them well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N.H.S . good to excellent . Moreover , nine out of ten people who have private hospitalization plans still use their government-paid general practitioner as a free family doctor .
