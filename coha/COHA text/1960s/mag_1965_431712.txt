 | One night some years ago Deborah Kerr appeared on TV 's What 's My Line . Afterward she was approached by a woman who wore her tweeds like a suit of armor . " My dear Miss Kerr , " said the formidable female , " I 've always admired you very much . I am the movie censor for Kansas , and I 've never had to cut a foot from one of your films . " " How dull , " murmured Deborah . The incident illustrates how Deborah feels about the fact that audiences persist in remembering , out of her 39 screen roles , only those which painted her as a pallid , prim " lady , " the sort who might wear a tiara to tea and pearls to bed . Even her portrayal of Hannah in The Night of the Iguana , while deeply moving in its humanity and gentle strength , is a performance whose subtleties may be lost on much of its audience . Most people who see it will probably recall Miss Kerr only as a savorless spinster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1947 . From a clutch of superb British films ( The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp , Vacation from Marriage , The Adventuress , Black Narcissus ) , she was catapulted into what she terms the " Years of Captivity , " specifically six of them at M-G-M , a studio which then branded the combination of English accent and good manners as anemic insipidity . In her initial American film , The Hucksters , she panted across the continent after Clark Gable with steamingly ulterior motives , yet was made to do it with the sexual abandon of a starchy old maid . " I was , " says Deborah , " as exciting as an oyster . " Ensuing roles , models of stiff-necked decorum , gave American multitudes the impression that Miss Kerr was , to use her own expression , " lacking a circulatory system . " It is a notion which refuses to come unstuck . When announcement was made last October that Deborah would star as Frank Sinatra 's wife in a Warner Bros. film titled Community Property , eyebrows belonging to those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combining Miss Kerr with Sinatra seemed as plausible as mixing May wine with a Mickey Finn . People did n't know , or had forgotten , that the same type of speculation took place nine years ago , when Deborah and Robert Mitchum were cast opposite each other in Heaven Knows , Mr. Allison . The upshot of that combination was a mutual esteem which still exists  | today ; the rough , tough Mitchum describes Deborah as " the greatest broad , and one of the finest ladies , I ever worked with . " The fact is , Deborah has a circulatory system matched by few of the world 's femmes fatales . She is one of those rare beings , a beautiful woman with great humor and deep compassion . It is said that every man who has worked with her seems , in some special way , to be in love with her . She is vastly human , with something for everyone , stemming from a circulatory arrangement which boils and races in numerous directions . For example , Miss Kerr has a temper . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theater , the curtain was up on the second act of Tea and Sympathy . The glow of soft lights supported the tenderness of the scene in which Deborah , as Laura Reynolds , tried to deter a boy in her husband 's school from visiting a prostitute . In the first row of the orchestra , two men who had chattered all during the first act continued their babbling . Quite suddenly , Deborah broke out of character . Leaning menacingly over the footlights , she addressed the brace of boors in a voice of polished crystal : " Shut up ! " ( She also has a conscience : guilt over this breach of theater ethics still gives her an occasional stab of shame . ) Deborah has fire . During the filming of Heaven Knows , Mr. Allison , she had to paddle a boat by means of a palm frond up a steaming river of Tobago Island . Director John Huston stood in the camera boat preceding Deborah 's craft , urging her on . In her nun 's habit , under the broiling sun , Deborah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a will . " Faster , " said Huston . " Faster ! Row as hard as you can ! " She hurled the palm frond into the muddy water and shoved the coif back from her glistening forehead . " What in hell do you think I 'm doing ? " she demanded . She can be salty . During the shooting of The Night of the Iguana , she said of the brouhaha fanned by the activities of **26;517;TOOLONG , " I 'm getting a bit bored with the constant assumption I am the one safe , sensible element no one has to worry about around here . I think it would serve them all right if I suddenly got roaring drunk , leaped on Richard , pulled Ava 's hair , and disappeared for three days ! " She did n't because , whether or not she likes the term , she is an oasis of sanity in the madcap world of moviemaking . Says producer Leo McCarey , " Deborah is one of the few real ladies of the screen ? although she has her W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He refers to those times when Deborah blows a line . " Pardon me , gentlemen , " she says . . . . Then , after a round of choice expletives ( muttered to herself ) , " Now I think I can do this scene . " A star noted for ability to create harmony around her , she has been voted by crews such awards as " Best Disposition and Most Fun of Any Star We Ever Worked With . " She bends over backwards to avoid malice in any form . One of Hannah 's lines from The Night of the Iguana might have been written by her : " Nothing human disgusts me unless it is unkind or violent . " In brief , she is possessed of exquisite manners , due in part to her innately kind nature and in part to her upbringing . This began near the banks of Loch Lomond in Helensburgh , Scotland . where she was born September 30 , 1921 . Her father , Arthur Kerr-Trimmer , was a naval architect whose military service in World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Deborah remembers her mother Kathleen as a redhaired , green-eyed angel who ceaselessly ministered to the family 's needs . After her father contracted tuberculosis Deborah was periodically shipped off to live with grandparents , notably her maternal grandmother , who harbored Victorian ideas on child rearing . One such was the notion that one 's hack is strengthened by lying supine on the floor . During these hour-and-a-half daily ordeals Deborah was not allowed even to read , on the theory it would damage her eyes . She was drilled in self-control and unquestioning obedience to authority . Later Deborah 's family moved to England 's West country , and Deborah entered boarding school in Bristol . She recalls those days with unabashed hatred ? the rigid regimentation , the rice pudding she called frog spawn , the musty and/or cabbage smell of the school , the uniforms " designed to make us look hideous " ( gym tunic and long cotton stockings , the latter required even at tennis ) , most of all the bullying of the other girls . Bereft of playmates other than her younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to living in the world of imagination . The older girls found her an ideal target for browbeating . On the day she finally left the detested school she began working under the tutelage of her aunt Phyllis Smale , an actress of some note who ran a drama school in Bristol . Torn between acting and ballet , which she had studied since the age of ten , Deborah temporarily deserted drama when she was accepted by the Sadlers Wells Ballet . There followed a year in London of slipped kneecaps and poultices and incredible discipline ? and the gnawing knowledge she was too tall for a ballerina . She found the life too nunlike for her 17 years and soon was pounding London 's pavements in search of acting jobs . Deborah likes to tell the story of how , years later , when she was doing a play in Paris , she ran into Dame Ninette de Valois , who ran Sadlers Wells . The flint-tongued muse of the dance squinted at Deborah through narrowed eyes and said , " I remember you quite well , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " The chore of convincing London impresarios that she was indeed an actress ceased the day Deborah lunched with an agent at the Savoy Hotel . A great bear of a man lumbered to their table , and in a thick Hungarian accent asked the agent , " And who is the sweet little virgin ? " Disconcerted , Deborah dropped her eyes ? until she realized the man was producer Gabriel Pascal , whereupon she stated breathlessly she was an actress . " Take down your hair , " said Pascal peremptorily . " You look like a tart ! " Trained to obedience , Deborah then and there took the pins from her hair and let it fall about her shoulders . She says now , " I suppose I was a bit mad ? one is when one is young and has some sort of marvelous protective blinkers . But I think it intrigued him . " Pascal ordered her to his office for an audition . There , in a room filled with " jaded movie men , " Pascal said , " You are too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me the Lord 's Prayer . " Through the haze of smoke and tinkling of ice from highball glasses , he liked what he saw and heard and put Deborah under contract and into the role of the Salvation Army girl in the film Major Barbara . Thereafter , Pascal farmed her out for other films , the last of which , Vacation from Marriage , caught the eye of L. B. Mayer . Amid a figurative flare of bugles , Deborah was transported to the magic shores of Hollywood , along with her husband Anthony Bartley , a British flying ace whom she had met and married during the war . She had longed to come to America , for freedom from the penurious life of postwar England , and because she had liked the outgoing friendliness of Americans she had known . Now she was agog at the size and plenty of America , and wide-eyed at the social mores of Hollywood and the ministrations of M-G-M , awash with awe at the arrival of a real lady on their doorstep . " I supposed I snowed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ripple through her speech . At the studio they called her " Miss Cur " until Mayer splashed the nation 's billboards with the message " Kerr Rhymes with Star . " The publicity department suggested she make a habit of wearing large-brimmed hats so they could hatch items to the effect she thereby protected her " porcelain com-  | plexion . " ( " Good Lord ! " breathed Deborah . ) For their first Hollywood dinner party she and Bartley arrived at five minutes past the designated hour , were told the host and hostess were still dressing , and watched in quasi-terror as men in white coats bore to a station behind the roast beef a scantily clad girl reposing on one elbow . The one sane element was their rented cottage ( she had politely rejected the suggestion that , being English , she would want a " castle-type house " ) set in the midst of a citrus grove . " We leaned out our window and picked a lemon to squeeze into our drinks ? the height of debauchery . " The studio catered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistically did n't seem to know what to do with her . One high-necked , long-suffering , bloodless maiden-lady part followed another . Her role as an alcoholic in Edward , My Son was a respite from the puff-pastry parts , but proved nothing to the movie moguls because the film itself was a financial flop . In six years she asked for only one role , that of the lead in The African Queen . Replied Dore Schary , then head of production at M-G-M , " We already have one African story ; we do n't want to buy another . " Nevertheless she found herself in Africa , which had n't been precisely her request , doing King Solomon 's Mines ? a film she says immortalized her as the girl who fell into a river and emerged with hair perfectly coiffured . In 1953 she dug in her heels at long last and found someone to fight for her ? the late Bert Allenberg . Allenberg , hired as her agent , promptly persuaded M-G-M to lend her to Columbia Studio for the role of Karen Holmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chandeliers were set swinging all over the world by Miss Kerr 's adhesive embrace with Burt Lancaster on the beach . Audiences gasped at the metamorphosis and critics raved that Deborah was " human after all . " Deborah was annoyed at the general astonishment . " To be sexy , " she said , " I do n't think you have to be a bosomy wench in a tight dress , with a leer , a wiggle , and a wet mouth . All you have to be is warm and alive . I 've always had sex , but Hollywood did n't notice . " To do Tea and Sympathy on Broadway ( it ran for a year , and she took it on the road for another year ) she asked for release from her contract and happily forfeited a year 's salary to get it . Returning to Hollywood , she pitched into a parcel of roles worthy of her talent , and in the ensuing years racked up a score of six Academy nominations as Best Actress ? without winning . Specifically , she has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , From Here to Eternity , The King and I , Heaven Knows , Mr. Allison , Separate Tables and The Sundowners . The incomprehensible fact that she has not yet been voted an Oscar is commented upon caustically by a friend . " Perhaps if Deborah had flaring nostrils , or dirty hair , or a forty-four-inch bosom , she would have won . It is shameful that her flawless acting should have been so ignored . " A lesser woman than Deborah Kerr might well be bitter , but never by word or action has she shown disappointment . If anything , she has mellowed since those harrowing years , and since her divorce from Bartley in 1959 . The marriage had begun in the excitement WHAT OUR GUARANTY MEANS TO YOU Because we satisfy ourselves that every product we advertise is good , G000 HousEKEEPING offers you the protection of our Consumers ' Guaranty ( see page 6 ) .

You will hear from him promptly . and romance of wartime and deteriorated under the onus of an insoluble situation . A man of heroic courage , Anthony Bartley was nonetheless in the position of many young Englishmen deprived of their career-building years by a six-year war . Finally he tried his hand at film producing , which took him abroad frequently and for long periods . The separations , and even more damaging , the lot of an uncelebrated man married to a celebrated woman ? despite their understanding of each other 's problems ? resulted inevitably in divorce . Characteristically , Deborah refuses to discuss the subject . " There is no reason to exchange any more hurts for the children to read . " In a rare use of cliche she insists she and Bartley are good friends , that perhaps their relationship today is better than it has ever been . In July 1960 she married Peter Viertel , screen scenarist and author of the novel Love Lies Bleeding , in Switzerland , where they still live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found too good to leave , and has done so only for her roles in The Innocents , The Chalk Garden and The Night of the Iguana . She describes Viertel as " distinguished , with a rather somber face until he smiles , and then it is a wickedly mischievous face . He is tremendously tender of heart , with enormous concern for others , but does n't show this on the surface . If the girls or I say anything schmaltzy , sentimentally sloppy , he has the most devastating way of cutting away the ground from under our feet . His humor is fantastic ? I think it 's his humor I love most about him . He has endless patience with children , all children , teaching them skiing and surf- ing and tennis . Peter is a real man . He is such strength and support for me ? more so than he knows . He has given me a courage which I never had , taught me to be capable of really coping with life . Now I live life rather than merely thinking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . With daughters Melanie , 17 , and Francesca , 13 , as well as Viertel 's 13-year-old Christine , the family spends a great deal of time skiing in winter . In summer they rent a Basque farmhouse overlooking the sea on one side and the Pyrenees on the other , using it as a base for the surfing sport Viertel more or less introduced to Europe 's shores . Deborah confines herself to the care of equipment ? waxing the boards and strapping them to the car , and has cut so many official ribbons at newly discovered surfing beaches that she is known over there as Queen of the Surfing Set . With her new-found confidence she directs a kinder backward glance at the M-G-M days , feeling gratitude that the studio made her name known the world over , and remembering fondly the people who tried to carry her about on a lily pad .

Rock Hudson , who found himself seated next to Deborah at a formal dinner when he was new to Hollywood and suffering the tortures of imagined inferiority , is indebted to her for having put him at his ease via a bawdy remark that all but tumbled him out of his chair . Deborah 's between-takes humor makes for happy sets . With Bob Mitchurn in Heaven Knows , Mr. Allison , she composed rhyming couplets , ribald often as not . On An Affair to Remember , she and Cary Grant shouted back and forth to each other lines from old English music-hall songs . Samples : " Me father ' as no nose . " " ' Ow does he smell ? " " Orful ! " Or , " You look like Helen Brown . " " I do n't look well in green either . " For Deborah , humor is the stuff of life . " I just could n't get on if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yet despite her crackling wit , her adroit way with a phrase , Miss Kerr has gone 20 years ( since The Adventuress ) without a role to display her great comedic talent . Or , for that matter , her full range . Playwright Robert Anderson neatly sums it up when he says , " I think an American audience tends to see its heroes and heroines in terms of one quality only ; they do n't want to be confused . But Deborah possesses every note in the scale of a real woman . . . from passion and anger and dedication to wit and humor and bawdiness . We can only hope that one day she 'll have a chance to play all these notes in one role . "
