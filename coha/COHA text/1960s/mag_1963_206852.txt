James Meredith knows what James Baldwin is writing about . Off for the holidays from the University of Mississippi campus , where he still suffers constant harassment from white students , Meredith last week visited Chicago-and scarcely had he arrived when he learned that several shotgun blasts had been fired at his father 's home in Kosciusko , Miss . <P> Nobody was hurt , but , Meredith insisted at a press conference , that was not the point . " I have n't asked the local law enforcement to help because even if they knew who did it , they would n't do anything , " he said . " But I 'm not interested in what they do . I 'm concerned that the Negro be treated like a human being and in his getting what is necessary to achieve this . It 's not just my problem ; it 's America 's problem . " <P> Meredith was annoyed when newsmen asked him about his grades at Ole Miss . The university has said nothing , but rumors persist that Meredith is doing poorly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meredith said . " Maybe you do n't think it 's a very serious situation . I hear over the radio that my father 's house has been shot into and you ask me how my grades are . This is not a casual thing . My father is 71 years old . He has worked hard to send ten kids through school . It 's a very serious thing when my father ca n't sleep in peace . What do you have to look forward to ? What good was it for him to pay his debts , to lead an honest life-and then he ca n't live in his home in peace without being shot at ? "
