The chief rabbi of the British Commonwealth is one of the most prestigious posts in world Jewry . As leader of more than 820,000 Jews-450,000 of them in Britain-he is recognized by British protocol as one of the country 's premier spiritual lords : at state occasions he sits with his peers , the Primate of All England and the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster . Vacant since the retirement of Dr. Israel Brodie in May 1965 , the post will now be filled by an Orthodox rabbi from the U.S. : Immanuel Jakobovits , 45 , of Manhattan 's Fifth Avenue Synagogue . <P> Jakobovits , who accepted the $19,600-a-year post last week , will become titular chief of a Jewish community rich in both tradition and troubles . Jews emigrated to Britain from France as early as the 11th century . Driven into exile 200 years later , the Jews returned during the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell , have since blossomed into one of the world 's wealthiest and least persecuted Judaic communities . By the 19th century , the Rothschilds , Montagus and Samuelses made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today , 40 members of Parliament are Jews , as well as 61 knights and 20 peers of the realm . Although Jews are expected to congregate at their own country clubs , there is comparatively little overt anti-Semitism in Britain-one of the few nations where Jews were never forced to cluster together in ghettos . <P> " God 's Cossacks . " About 70% of British Jewry is Orthodox-a fact that is no guarantee of cohesiveness . On the far left of the community-scorned as near apostates by Jews who observe Halacha ( religious law ) - are the minority of Reform Jews , similar in their modernizing views to American Conservative Judaism , and the Liberals , who theologically conform roughly to the Reform movement in the U.S. Representing the mainstream of Orthodoxy - and most of the wealthy Anglo-Jewish families-is the United Synagogue , which governs 80 congregations in Greater London . Although it defends the full authority of Halacha , the United Synagogue is nonetheless suspected of liberal tendencies by the militant Federation of Synagogues , which was founded by recent emigrants from Eastern Europe , although its supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for generations . Fearful of being absorbed by goyim culture , these Jews think of themselves as " God 's Cossacks , " and recognize the authority of the chief rabbi only when he is strict enough for their taste . <P> <P> Within the past two years , tensions have been rising within British Judaism . One source of conflict was Dr. Louis Jacobs , sometime rabbi of London 's <P> New West End Synagogue , who outraged his fellow Orthodox rabbis by insisting that the Bible was not infallible ( TIME , May 22 , 1964 ) . Still other feuds have been created by attempts of Reform Jewish temples to join local , Orthodox-dominated synagogue conferences . Contributing to the lack of calm has been the lengthy , rumor-ridden search for a new chief rabbi , who was expected to be stern enough to placate the Cossacks , progressive enough to negotiate with Reform and Liberal Jews , less than 51 years old-and blessed with no trace of a foreign accent .                 @ @ @ @
