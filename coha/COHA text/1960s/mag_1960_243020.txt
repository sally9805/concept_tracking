" The honorable judges of the Federal District Court for eastern Michigan are hereby given notice , " thundered Detroit 's evening News ( circ. 468,540 ) . " They will shortly have to bring contempt proceedings against the editor of the Detroit News . " Whereupon it tried to give the court a chance to do so by running an account of a civil-damage suit in apparent defiance of a court order suppressing the record of the case . <P> Since Detroit 's two other papers ran similar stories , their concerted defiance promptly blew up into a national journalistic cause clbre . Never before had the loftily independent News , John S. Knight 's crusading Free Press ( circ. 498,912 ) , and Hearst 's scrappy but third-ranking Times ( circ. 385,908 ) shown such editorial solidarity . Encouragement flowed in from all over , even from the bench : " The court 's business is the public business , " said Federal District Judge Arthur F. Lederle , who , convalescing in a Detroit hospital , had taken no part in the suppression order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The case in question was hardly likely to involve the public interest . Last February , probing a shortage in its books , a Detroit architectural engineering firm sued a former partner for an accounting , asked Federal District Judge Theodore Levin to suppress the record in order to spare embarrassment to those directly involved . Levin did , holding that the court has the " inherent right " to suppress any case . After the shortage-nearly $1,000,000-was publicly revealed with the arrest of the firm 's former head bookkeeper ( TIME , Dec. 21 ) , Detroit papers decided to make an issue of the suppression of the civil suit . <P> Instead of finding the newspapers in contempt , Judge Levin merely issued a statement observing that they were not . The stories published about the suit did not come from court records-as the papers themselves admitted-but from sources over which the court had no control . While holding to the suppression of the record at this time , Levin said that all hearings on the case will be held in open court . <P> Thus left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were inclined to drop the subject . But not the News , which was still troubled by the court 's " inherent right " claim . " We learn with regret : we 're not in contempt , " it editorialized last week . " We will try to violate the suppression rule to the judge 's satisfaction , and thus get the question on the proper road to settlement by a higher court . "
