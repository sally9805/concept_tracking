Hung-Up on Vietnam The more we smash in Vietnam , the more remains to be smashed , and when that is done , we shall still be doubting whether it was worth doing . Vietnam has become a chronic disease , debilitating and seemingly incurable . Max Frankel of The New York Times reports from Saigon the expectation of " a long guerrilla war even after the bigger communist units are hunted down and humbled . . . . A longer time still will pass before Americans can safely leave the nation to the policing of the South Vietnamese . . . perhaps a decade hence . " That prediction , too , may prove overly optimistic , like the White House statement of October 2 , 1963 : " 5ecretary McNamara and General Taylor reported their judgment that the major part of the US military task can be completed by the end of 1965 , although there may be a continuing requirement for a limited number of ... training personnel . They reported that by the end of this year the United States program for training Vietnamese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military personnel ... can be withdrawn . " General Eisenhower , who is usually a reliable barometer of the public mood , says he would " take any action to win . " But the General frankly admits he does n't know what action that might be . President Johnson is left suspended between distasteful alternatives . He does not want to obliterate Vietnam ; he does not want a war with China ; nor does he want to see all his efforts for a more constructive relationship with the communist states of Europe break down completely . Yet that is what " any action to win " may produce . The President has every incentive to liquidate this bankrupt enterprise . But how ? If he were to slack off , would he not demoralize the Vietnamese whose fortunes we are pledged to defend ? And would the hawks at home let him make peace ? and survive politically ? In short , Mr. Johnson is hung up , and the communists thus far have given him no way of getting off the hook easily . The President 's domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease-fire and been labeled " nervous Nellies " or charged with indifference to the danger of communism . They have pleaded for " no wider war " and been overruled by military exigencies . They have advised concentrating U5 forces in enclaves and have been told they were actually recommending a way station to withdrawal . The elections last month , the polls , the intransigence of the Viet Cong ? everything conspires to deny the critics ? and the Commander-in-Chief ? any significant freedom of action . We are the captives of rash cornmitments gripped by the persistent delusion that victory for " our " Vietnamese is a life-and-death necessity . The frustration of the dissenters is understandable , for they can not meet the demand put upon them to make sense out of a situation that is senseless , to tell the administration how to get out of a trap the critics warned against getting into . They have no power in the White House , or in Hanoi . The evangelical impulse of America is against them , an impulse strengthened by zo years of anti-communist editorializing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military orders . In this fiscal year , defense expenditures ? $1.25 billion a week ? will be almost $zo billion higher than in fiscal ' 65 , solely because of Vietnam . Meanwhile , the biggest domino in Asia ? India ? begs for more food and fertilizer , for masses of its people are starving . In this sixth year of undeclared war , perspective in Washington is as hard to Find as a Goldwater button . Not being tied down in Vietnam , and thus having less need for self-deception , foreigners are more apt than we to be skeptical about the overriding importance of denying South Vietnam to the Viet Cong . They note that the US tolerates a communist country oo miles off its coast ( we have almost forgotten Cuba is there ) . No doubt outsiders have a more dispassionate estimate than we of America 's competence and obligation to dictate which are and which are not the permissible revolutions around the world . They can stand aside , and do , waiting to see what will come out of the grim reform school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rehabilitates , rewards ? all in the con-fident hope that someday there will be enough good Vietnamese to take care of the incorrigibles ; then , perhaps , we can let them manage their own affairs . That is what pacification is , and it carries in its wake something uglier than the word pacification implies . In this kind of exercise , brutality comes to seem natural . The brutalization of French forces , responding to terrorism by their opponents , marked the final months of the war in Algeria . Now correspondents in Saigon are beginning to report mounting bitterness against any restraining hand and growing respect for the " tough " qualities . " When a sniper fires from a hamlet being secured by the Koreans , " an American officer tells columnists Evans and Novak , " the hamlet is leveled . " Well , troops do what they are sent to do , and this is a dirty business . They are having the worst of it ( over 6,000 GI 's have been killed so far ) , but they are not the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence erupts in our own cities . Taking account of rising military costs , the President last week announced that the Great Society will be cut back in the next fiscal year by several billion dollars more . The poor of America can put up with their poverty a decade or so longer ; the deferral of hopes at home is not the heart of the tragedy . It is that all of us ? in Vietnam and here at home ? are sacrificing for a cause that is not worth it . The Viet Cong may be foolish to go on fighting for control of their country . We are worse than foolish . We are waging a war that is none of our business and which can not be justified by any moral imperative or threat to our national security . Israel Condemned When , last October , an Israeli border police command car struck a mine near the Syrian border , killing three and wounding six , it was the US ambassador to Israel who persuaded Prime Minister Eshkol to complain to the Security Council instead of immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council led nowhere , and a month later another Israeli patrol vehicle struck a mine , this time near the border of Jordan . A major reprisal raid was ordered and its target was an area of Jordan where , the Israelis claim , Hussein 's authority does not extend and which until recently had been under the control of terrorist bands loyal to the Palestine Liberation Organization , and to the Syrian-led and armed El Cattail . The result was the Security Council 's censure of Israel on November 25 by a vote of 14 to nothing . Washington was at first reluctant to condemn Israel out of hand . It hoped to take some of the sting out of the UN censure motion by inserting a reference to terrorist raids . Then the riots broke out in Jordan . The US ambassador in Amman began sending alarming cables that unless King Hussein obtained full satisfaction in the UN , his days were numbered . The State Department panicked , and in the UN the Americans went along with the toughest possible resolution . Whether the UN 's action will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful , for his fate depends rather on his steadfast will to resist the pressure of his enemies and his ability to command the allegiance of his army . Both as yet seem unimpaired . The Security Council 's action will surely stand , however , as a landmark in UN peace-keeping history . In all previous condemnations , with the exception perhaps of the Red Chinese case in Korea , a specific act was condemned . In the Jordan vs Israel case , a country was condemned , and in the strongest possible terms . Consistency is not to be expected of nations , but it should be noted that every big power voting for the censure of Israel has in the last ao years engaged in exactly the same ( or worse ) kind of operation as the Israelis , and either got away with it altogether , or as lightly as possible : France and Britain at Suez ( the missing ingredient in the 1966 raid , which the Israelis lightly overlooked ) , 15 Russian divisions in Hungary , the Bay of Pigs , the French against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28 , 1964 , British jets destroyed a Yemen border force at Harib . The case went to the UN . It was there , on April 6 , 1964 , while not voting for Britain 's condemnation , that the late Adlai Stevenson laid down what had been until then ( the Bay of Pigs notwithstanding ) American policy : " My government hasrepeatedly expressed its emphatic disapproval of provocative acts and retaliatory raids wherever they occur and by whomever committed " ? a phrase that Ambassador Goldberg was to cite again . This was said by Mr. Stevenson exactly four months before American war planes blasted one-third of the North Vietnamese navy out of the water , along with its shore installations , for an attack on American destroyers , and To months before President Johnson , on February 7 , 1965 , declared that the US was now launching " retaliatory attacks against barracks and staging areas of North Vietnam . " Twenty-two months and about a half-million tons of bombs later ( 225,000 tons of bombs were expended in Vietnam in 1965 , and 638,000 tons were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this must have become world history 's longest retaliatory raid . And the Security Council has yet to lift an admonishing finger . U Thant 's Decision At the time these lines are being written , the conditions on which the UN Secretary General , U Thant , agreed to withdraw his decision to resign are not yet known . But it is said that he obtained little , if anything at all . For a long while U Thant has been a forceful advocate of admitting Communist China to the UN . Without that membership , he has said , the world organization can not function properly . But all through last week , the vote in the UN on Chinese representation showed that this problem will not soon be settled . When it is , it will have been preceded by an agreement between Washington and Peking , and that may require a decade , perhaps two . The Secretary General has criticized the system which allows him to be nothing more than a clerk . But much as they wished him to stay on the job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to give him much more power . He might have been assured that the Russians and the French will finally come through with their long-overdue voluntary contributions to the UN budget . Those payments , however , will amount only to a fraction of what the two countries owe the UN , and the payments were expected from them anyway . Finally , it is probable that U Thant was not given the reward he openly considered most important ? a move toward deescalation of the war in Vietnam , beginning with an unconditional and permanent cessation of American raids on the North . Why , then , did U Thant reverse himself and agree to stay ? Most likely it is because he accepted the validity of the argument put to him last Tuesday in a dramatic , 12-minute meeting with the representatives of the four big powers . In effect , they said : " If you leave , we will not be able to agree upon a successor . The United Nations is in such had shape that only the presence of the Secretary General keeps it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be completely paralyzed and disintegrate soon thereafter . Yet the world needs the United Nations . " Think only of what would happen should another world crisis like the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962 arise . Where would the parties to the dispute address their grievAnces ? How would they arrange for a cooling-off period , before direct negotiations are begun ? Without the United Nations . the confrontation ? a nuclear confrontation perhaps ? could become unavoidable . " Another man , perhaps a harsher bargainer , might have been unmoved , might have refused to yield after having said so often and so publicly that he would quit unless the big powers were really prepared to let him be an effective Secretary General . But the idea of self-sacrifice comes naturally to U Thant . And what he has done is to subordinate his personal prestige to the survival of the world organization . Only time will show whether his decision will pay off . No doubt it had to be made , and for it Secretary General U Thant deserves the gratitude of everyone . The Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay indoors is no defense against smog , but it was the most sensible advice to come from the New York City officials during Thanksgiving weekend . A blanket of choking air had settled over the city the day before Thanksgiving , and all during the holiday the commissioner for air pollution , Mr. Austin Heller , watched his instruments jiggle up and down . That evening , when the cars started back into the city , the carbon monoxide level spurted over the danger point , and the commissioner solemnly if inexplicably announced a " watch " condition was in effect . The next day things got worse and Governor Rockefeller issued a " first alert advisory " for the metropolitan area . New Jersey and Connecticut followed suit . A first alert advisory calls on the citizenry to " voluntarily " stop running automobiles when possible , and asks owners of apartment buildings not to operate incinerators and to keep furnaces burning low . If the first alert does n't work , a second alert urges more " voluntary " curbs . Luckily this nonsense went no further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of this leaves Mayor Lindsay ( he was in Bermuda ) looking foolish , since he had made so much of his interest in air pollution . Had the city really been concerned about the effects of smog , it would have ordered Consolidated Edison Co. , which accounts for about one-third of the pollution through its coal and oil burning power plants , either to burn natural gas or to buy electricity from the northeast power " grid , " that is , to bring in the electricity from Canada . This would have stopped most of the sulphur dioxide going into the air . To control the carbon monoxide , a far more serious problem , the city then should have had the police stop automobiles coming into Manhattan . The best Mayor Lindsay 's people could do was to stop burning garbage at municipal dumps . All day Friday the streets of midtown Manhattan were jammed with traffic . While Con Ed says it doubled the amount of natural gas it burns in an effort to help out , its stacks were belching forth the usual black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or coal which contained a high sulphur dioxide content . The federal government was helpless as usual . The air pollution control program in the Public Health Service is too small to worry anyone ( about $15 million a year ) , and its main function is to start local public relations campaigns against air pollution . Since 1964 , the Public Health Service has sought to mount an enforcement action in the New Jersey-New York metropolitan area , and a conference is finally to be held January 3 . But the conference is only the first formal step ; the business can drag on for another three years before any of the industries even has to begin a clean-up . The federal government may move even further away from enforcement , if the rumors prove true and John Middleton , a Californian , more interested in research than enforcement , is appointed to run the office . Air pollution will not respond to anything but radical change . This means the use of electric vehicles in cities ; it means grappling with sulphur dioxide on a national basis . Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal and residual fuel oil sold in interstate commerce , or it can go further and determine what kinds of fuels should be used in making electricity . Little by Little , Less and Less of the OEO The loudest noise heard in Washington is the sound of Sargent Shriver whistling in the dark . As the lights dim in the Office of Economic Opportunity , Shriver gamely claims that somehow he can keep up the war on poverty . He called a press conference the other day to protest congressional cutbacks in the OEO budget . His words were strong , but it was pretty late in the day to say them . Last summer , when the administration 's modest request for $1.75 billion was up before Congress , all was silence . Shriver played with the idea of raising a fuss among the poverty-minded around the country , and he instructed his underlings to see how it might be done . But at least two of Shriver 's men were hearing different drummers , Don Baker , the OEO general counsel , and William Phillips , the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign . They stopped community protests and refused to let other officials and sympathizers lobby on Capitol Hill . Shriver apparently felt the ground being cut out from under him ; Baker and Phillips were more concerned with what the Bureau of the Budget had to sayabout antipoverty than in what Shriver wanted . They heard faint signals emanating from the White House itself which sounded like " cut back " and " go slow . " The consequence of their cool-it policy was a $138 million cut from the original administration request , and amendments to the Economic Opportunity Act which , for the most part , limited the flexibility and innovative elements of the whole effort . Shriver 's press conference announcement may have been an attempt to do in December what he failed to do in August : marshal " grass-roots " support for a program that will have even more trouble in the Both Congress . " The poor will feel they have been shortchanged , " Shriver said . " They will feel they have been double-crossed . The poor will feel that democracy is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be limp . Only in a few isolated areas has the poverty war built the militant constituencies it needs for such game-saving efforts . More often than not , the angriest , toughest people would as soon lead a fight against OEO as for it . When community workers tried to rouse poor people in a Washington slum to fight for more OEO funds , they heard only bitter recriminations against the agency . In any case , Shriver has been unclear enough about his intentions for " community action , " and OEO policy has been so contradictory , that convincing pressure is not going to affect Congress this time . By putting the blame for cutbacks on Congress , Shriver is able to give OEO more freedom to make the kind of arbitrary , political decisions which are increasingly characteristic of the agency . The plea of insufficiency of funds and congressional stipulations can always be used to counter the criticisms of OEO . The rhetoric of democratic participation in deciding who gets what has been remarkably unfulfilled . Decisions are made high up in Washington , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have little to do with the objective standards which even the bureaucrats themselves use . Thus , funds for Washington 's antipoverty agency will be drastically cut this year , but not for the purpose of trimming the agency 's top-heavy administration , which would be legitimate . Instead , neighborhood jobs will be eliminated . Presumably , there will he other jobs provided in new programs ? for different poor people . But the OEO judges its work more by statistics than by people . If a hundred poor people have jobs this year , and a hundred had jobs last year , the poverty war is considered a success . No matter that last year 's hundred were fired and a new hundred hired ; or that the two programs differ hugely in their impact on poverty . Such reasoning was used in Mississippi , where Shriver promised ( in a telegram in the September 18 NR ) that " there will be a Head Start . " What happened , however , was that the OEO killed the Child Development Group of Mississippi , and substituted programs more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same number of poor people will have Head Start jobs , and the same number of children will be in the preschools . But the more it seems the same , the more it will change . How long Shriver and the OEO are for this world is the question of the month . Much OEO work will be delegated by administrative order to other agencies : the new " Kennedy-Javits " program of jobs and training will be handled by the Labor Department , and there are other examples . The Republicans want the OEO dismembered , and its major functions given to other departments Head Start to Health-EducationWelfare , the Job Corps to Labor , and perhaps Community Action to Housing and Urban Development . The OEO could remain as a nonoperating " think tank . " Many Democrats seem to harbor the same ideas . Next year , the " conservative coalition " may make another attempt to break it up , and the White House will probably sit back and let the chips fall . Although the administration will probably not make specific proposals for abolishing OEO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formula devised for its transformation . The President has announced additional cuts in this year 's expenditures , and next year 's budget request will be appropriately meager . All in all , the evidence mounts that neither Shriver nor the OEO will be around ? in their present forms ? very much longer .
