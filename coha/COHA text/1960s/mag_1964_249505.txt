The pop art of 50 years ago had an attribute not shared by the pop art of today : it was popular . The most popular of the artists of that time , Maxfield Parrish , now 93 , painted book illustrations and calendars that were reproduced by the millions . College boys hung his works in their rooms amidst a clutter of crew oars , fencing foils and mooseheads . From a first cover for Harper 's Weekly in 1895 , he painted on to become the country 's best-paid artist . <P> Parrish 's gnomes and damsels , straight out of King Arthur and tempered by romantic Pre-Raphaelite gentility , adorned the covers of Collier 's , Century and Scribner 's . His best-known commission ( around $50,000 ) was a 28-ft. - long mural of Old King Cole for the merry old souls in the bar of John Jacob Astor 's Hotel Knickerbocker , which can still be seen in Manhattan 's Hotel St. Regis . Medieval nobility was a deathless theme for Parrish ; even the caption for his 1921 Jell-O ad ran : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Parrish was indeed , the pop artist of his era . <P> What ever could bring Parrish back ? None other than the pop promoter of this era : Lawrence Alloway , nimble curator of Manhattan 's Guggenheim Museum . Alloway has escorted a show of Parrish 's work from far-out Bennington College to Manhattan 's conservative Gallery of Modern Art , where last week 52 Parrish.es went on view . <P> <P> Alloway gave his highest praise to Parrish : " Behind a screen of high technique , Parrish is master of the cliche , of the image of the moment . " But perhaps even more could be said in his favor . <P> <P> The artist 's famous " Parrish blue , " a highly glazed ultramarine over sleek gesso , still glows with an outer-space beauty . His overly graceful figures , like fashion models , strut and stretch , as clearly defined against grainy color backdrops as if they were modern hardedge images given fingers and toes . Only the brooding golden backlighting that makes theaters out of Parrish 's scenar ios bespeaks a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , where he has lived for more than 50 years , Parrish is plainly baffled ; he thinks of himself as derrire-garde . " How can these avant-garde people get any fun out of my work ? " he asks . " I 'm hopelessly commonplace . " He could n't have picked a more fashionable word .
