To the Turner family of Eastern Kentucky 's Breathitt County , politics comes as naturally as breathing . Ervine Turner , who died last year after a 40-year career as state senator , school superintendent and circuit judge , first became a power in the mountainous area when he brought Breathitt the benefits of the New Deal . His death did nothing to weaken his family 's Snopesian hold on the county . His wife Marie served as county school superintendent for 38 years until her retirement last June , and still remains president of the Citizens Bank of Jackson , the county seat . Their son John is a state senator . Their daughter , Mrs. Treva Turner Howell , continues the old family tradition of doing good for the poor while doing well politically-something the massive poverty program has made rather easy . She administers the local poverty effort , sowing federal largesse and reaping a bumper crop of votes for the county Democratic organization headed by her husband , Jeff Davis Howell . <P> Now , however , the family 's dominance of Breathitt County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration . Alarmed at what he considers partisan abuse of the poverty program , Governor Louie B. Nunn has vetoed a $177,000 Office of Economic Opportunity grant to the Middle Kentucky River Area Development Council ( MKRADC ) . The organization , headquartered in Jackson and run by Mrs. Howell , is responsible for administering sorely needed poverty projects worth $2,000,000 a year in Breathitt and three neighboring counties . Two-thirds of the region 's families have incomes of less than $3,000 a year . <P> No Conditions . Many , living in isolated hollows miles from the main road , exist on no earned incomes at all , under conditions that make life in an urban ghetto seem almost luxurious by comparison . Their houses are made of tarpaper or unseasoned wood , their food consists of what they can shoot , trap or buy with Government food stamps . <P> Indoor plumbing is virtually nonexistent , roads are unpaved and often impassable . Nunn brings a formidable barrage of charges against Mrs. Howell . In documents sent to OEO headquarters in Washington , he claims that her election as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since resigned , was a member of the board . The Governor also charges that she kept program funds in a family-owned bank and makes support of her family and party an implicit condition for MKRADC assistance . Nunn denies he wants to replace Mrs. Howell with a Republican . " I do n't care who they get to run the program , " he says , " as long as he 's competent and the poverty money goes where it is intended to go , for the benefit of the poor and with no conditions attached .
