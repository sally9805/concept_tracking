Irishmen drink the rich , dark brew known as Guinness Stout pretty much as a patriotic duty . Of all the stout consumed in the country , 75% is produced by 206-year-old Arthur Guinness Son &; Co. , which has grown so large that it is a keystone of the Irish economy . Guinness employs 4,300 people , more than anyone else except the government . Indirectly , it supports 26,000 employees of 14,500 pubs-and 16,000 Irish farmers depend on Guinness to buy 100,000 tons of barley annually . The company pays $23 million yearly in excise taxes , has lent the government money to build peat-briquette factories , contributes to both University and Trinity colleges . At that rate , any Irish " pintman " who does n't drink all the Guinness pints he can is practically traitorous . <P> Candy &; Drugs . Guinness can be grateful for the fact that the Irish have indeed been doing their duty . Making his annual report this week , Arthur Francis Benjamin Guinness , Viscount Elveden , 28 , the sixth Guinness to run the company , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guinness ' earnings ten years ago . Other nations , in addition , are picking up the Irish sense of obligation . Guinness and the company 's newer Harp Lager are now marketed the world over ; more than $20 million worth is exported annually . Between exports and Guinness brewed in three overseas plants , 5,000,000 pints a day are downed globally . Africans consider Guinness a potent aphrodisiac , something that has never frightened the Irish . <P> In spite of higher sales , pre-tax profits are down 7% from last year , largely because of the increased taxes being levied abroad . In Britain , the company 's best export market , served by a fleet of Guinness ships plying the Irish Sea , surtaxes are costing Guinness $1,400,000 a year . To balance such expenses , Guinness is diversifying considerably . The company now owns several British candy firms , along with 200 candy stores that cater to the below-the-beer-age market . It also controls two pharmaceutical firms in Ireland and a land-development company . <P> Silver Tankard . Guinness ' principal product , however , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been for two centuries . In 1759 , looking for a place to invest a 100 inheritance , Arthur Guinness leased a bankrupt brewery beside the Liffey River ; the St. James 's Gate plant is still the company 's principal operation , has grown into a 63-acre sprawl that is one of the world 's largest breweries . The chairman 's job and brewing secrets have since passed regularly from father to son except in one case . Viscount Elveden 's father was killed in World War II , and today 's incumbent took over at 24 from an aging grandfather . Although Guinness became a public company in 1886 , it is still family-controlled . Along with Eton-and Cambridge-educated Elveden , eight other Guinnesses sit on the board . Like the rest of Ireland , Guinness people do their duty by the company . Workers are allowed two free pints of stout each day . At board meetings , by long tradition , a silver tankard of Guinness stout is set in front of each director .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
