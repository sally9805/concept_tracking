A man 's home may be his castle , but if he riles the neighbors , they may have a lot more say about the place than he does . William M. Phillips , feature editor of the Miami Herald , learned that expensive lesson when he decided to install a railroad caboose in his backyard . Phillips ' family had outgrown his one-bedroom house , and he needed cheap , additional living space for his three children . What he got was a blizzard of bills that have now hit $10,000 and an endless zoning suit that has become the longest in the history of Florida 's Dade County . Even worse , he has now been ordered to get rid of the caboose . <P> Board v. Board . According to Phillips , his most serious error was that he got only verbal permission for his housing scheme from a zoning official , who now denies everything . When the neighbors yowled that the caboose violated the zoning code ban on any " eyesore or nuisance " in Miami , the local zoning board bucked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion that the caboose be painted green , hidden by shrubs and used only as a playhouse . That pleased neither side , so the case ascended to the zoning board of appeals , which ordered Phillips to remove the caboose within six months . Taking to the courts , Phillips lost one attempt for appeal after another up to the Florida Supreme Court , which refused to hear him on the ground that his lawyer used the wrong legal approach . <P> By now , the zoning board of appeals had been stripped of its decision-making authority . Phillips started all over again , and twice he got a recommendation for a variance covering the caboose . But the Metro Commission , which governs the county and has the final word , said no each time . Phillips ' neighbors finally asked the state attorney to charge him with criminal violation of the zoning code-punishable by a $500 fine and 60 days in jail for each day 's violation . <P> Injunction v. Injunction . Phillips was so mad that he put a $5,200 mortgage on his house to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoin the county from haling him into criminal court . Circuit Judge Joe Eaton ruled that the caboose must go and that the county should pay Phillips $975 for his trouble . Neither side liked that decision either , and both appealed . But the district court of appeals upheld the lower court . <P> Last week , in an effort to settle the whole scrap , the Metro Commission voted to pay Phillips the $975 set by Judge Eaton and accept the injunction that ordered him to remove the caboose . Phillips reluctantly agreed to go along . Looking back on the long fight , he says he would have preferred to be prosecuted in criminal court as a zoning law violator . He feels that then he might have pleaded his case before a jury that would have been more sympathetic than his neighbors.
