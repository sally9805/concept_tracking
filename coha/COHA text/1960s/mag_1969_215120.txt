FAKE ! by Clifford Irving . 243 pages . McGraw-Hill. $7.95 . <P> <P> For every credibility gap , there is an equal amount of gullibility fill . This is particularly true in the art market , where the stampede for status and dollar appreciation has helped to enrich art forgers and unscrupulous dealers . <P> Last year in Texas , 44 paintings in the collection of Dallas Oilman Algur Hurtle Meadows turned out to be phonies . Most duped collectors are usually so sore in their pride that they say nothing or try to recoup quietly . Others , who have unwittingly donated forgeries to museums for big tax write-offs , discover that discretion is the better part of value . Not A. H. Meadows . After publicly calling himself " Mr. Sap , " he pressed charges . Investigations led to the discovery of one of the most successful art swindles in modern history . <P> Delicious Deception . Journalists had a field day . How delicious is the deception of the rich ! What a blow for aesthetic egalitarianism ! And what a cast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of homosexuals named Fernand Legros and Ral Lessard . Legros , a French-Egyptian given to wearing snug suits lined in red silk , jetted around the world with his counterfeit wares while maintaining a lavish Paris apartment and an all-male harem . Legros 's partner , Lessard , was a young Canadian with a handsome , honest face . On the road he was a cool con man too , but back home he became the frightened victim of Legros 's infidelities and rages . <P> The most interesting member of the ring , however , was hardly more than a phantasm of pseudonyms : Von Houry / Herzog / Cassou / Hoffman / Raynal / Dory-Boutin . Actually he was a man named Elmyr de Hory , the artist responsible for counterfeiting the countless drawings , gouaches , watercolors and oils sold as Picassos , Matisses , Modiglianis , Braques , Derains , Monets , Lgers , Dufys , Renoirs , Vlamincks and Van Dongens . Fake ! is basically Elmyr de Hory 's story as told to Novelist Clifford Irving ( The Valley , The 38th Floor ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gossip , bitchery and elusive truths . <P> Born into a rich and landed Hungarian family , De Hory cruised Europe 's capitals as a playboy artist during the ' 20s and ' 30s . He studied with Fernand Lger in Paris and brushed elbow patches with artists whose works he was to fake in years to come . Life was an amusement that ended abruptly with World War II . Totally apolitical , Elmyr was nevertheless shipped off to a Transylvanian concentration camp . " I was , " he says with Magyar flair , " obviously too colorful a person for the safety of the state . " He survived the Carpathian winter by painting the commandant 's portrait-very slowly . <P> Penniless and stateless at the end of the war , Elmyr returned to Paris for some serious painting . In 1946 , an English friend visited his studio and mistook one of his unsigned sketches for a Picasso . Fancying herself a bit of an expert , she offered to buy it . " Well , why not ? " said Elmyr.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
