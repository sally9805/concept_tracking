When the pastor of the First Baptist Church in Alexandria , Va. , accepted a call to a bigger parish in Texas last winter , the seven laymen on the pulpit committee had to find a new preacher . It was not easy . During the next nine months , First Baptist 's committeemen checked out more than 100 prospects in 16 states , spent three Sundays out of four listening to sermons of possible candidates , traveled as far as Texas and Florida before deciding on the Rev. J. T. Ford of Atlanta 's Wieuca Road Baptist Church . Last week , after weighing the committee 's offer , delivering two trial sermons and meeting about 600 members of the congregation , Ford took the job . " I came to work Monday feeling quite a load lifted from my shoulders , " said Charles P. Little , the exhausted chairman of the committee . <P> Not since the days of the itinerant frontier preacher have so many Protestant ministers been afflicted with wanderlust , and for many churches the problem of replacing a departed pastor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support for the missions . In Houston , 40 of the city 's 187 Baptist churches have changed pastors during the past year , and about 10% of the 1,500 Congregational churches in New England are now without a fulltime minister . In Winston-Salem , N.C. , the First Presbyterian Church spent 13 months looking for the right man ; one committeeman traveled 12,000 miles on scouting expeditions . <P> " Challenge &; Opportunity . " Like the competition for good corporation presidents or college football players , it 's all a matter of supply and demand . Wealthy congregations in the cities and suburbs of both the East and West coasts usually have more eager candidates than they can easily screen . When California 's Pacific Palisades Presbyterian Church went minister hunting recently , the pulpit committee received an avalanche of messages from out-of-state pastors-some offering to take a salary cut to move to an area with growth possibilities . Rural areas of the South or small Midwestern towns have to take potluck . <P> The game of musical pulpits has a protocol as rigid as that of court tennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move elsewhere , generally let the word filter out through clerical friends . As a rule , pulpit committees play up " challenge " and " opportunity for service " rather than salary , insist that a minister dispose of any other offers he has before considering theirs . Under the rules of the game , an out-of-town candidate is seldom invited to preach directly to an interested congregation ; instead , pulpit committeemen drop into his church to hear him unobserved . But most committeemen are about as conspicuous as FBI agents at a Communist rally : they come in twos and threes , sit nervously on side aisles , usually fail to sign the visitors ' book or stand when newcomers are introduced .
