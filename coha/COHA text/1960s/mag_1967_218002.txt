Taking the oath at his third inauguration , Iowa 's Democratic Governor Harold Hughes bluntly stated the theme : <P> " I think we need to pay less attention to states ' rights and more attention to states ' responsibilities . " In other inaugural addresses and legislative pronunciamentos , Governors across the nation last week indicated that the states are at long last facing up to the urgent needs of an expanding population and an increasingly complex urban society . <P> One of the biggest problems facing most Governors is the outmoded machinery of state government itself , and in Arkansas , Washington , Oregon , Colorado and Iowa , the chief executives called for major changes in basic operating laws . Colorado 's Republican John Love , embarking on his second term , decried his state 's " crazy-quilt development of overlapping , duplicating , and sometimes competing groups of governmental jurisdictions , " warned that it could not sanguinely face the challenges of the future with the " organizational patterns of the 19th century . " <P> Urban Emphasis . Arkansas ' Winthrop Rockefeller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and-as he admitted-he could " hardly talk , " asked for basic revisions in the state 's 1874 constitution , and proposed a thorough , professional study of state operations , which are now hindered by an incredible total of 187 boards and commissions . As if to make the Republican Governor 's job of managing and coordinating the various boards that much harder , outgoing Governor Orval Faubus packed them with 93 last-minute appointments . <P> The problem of controlling the urban environment was high on nearly every Governor 's list of concerns . In Ohio , Republican James Rhodes , who had not shown much concern for the cities during his first term , set up a cabinet-level Office of Urban Affairs , promised action to combat air and water pollution . <P> Sprawl &; Smog . Washington 's Daniel Evans , one of the most dynamic of the young Republican Governors , observed , in a mid-term address to the legislature , that his state now faces the explosive growth that California has experienced . He asked for more and better state and local planning as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure that the state does not suffer from sprawl and smog . Love proposed similar action for Colorado , gloomily noting that the present " evidence is that we are in the process of destroying much of our natural environment , busily engaged in building cities that are for all practical purposes unlivable . " <P> Oregon 's incoming Republican Governor Tom McCall , at 6 ft. 5 in. the tallest Governor in the nation , asked for a 15% tax hike to finance his ambitious program . He also urged Oregon to become the first state in the Union to appoint an ombudsman to protect the citizen from police and bureaucratic abuses ( TIME , Dec. 2 ) . Said McCall : " It 's a modern addition to traditional checks and balances . " New Jersey Democrat Richard Hughes in his fifth annual legislative message similarly suggested that his state be the first to establish a public-defender system and outlined an agency to protect consumers .
