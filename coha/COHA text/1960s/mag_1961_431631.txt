 | O'Sullivan 's Wonderful Lead Balloon ECHO I , the huge space balloon that , ince last August , has been whizzing around the earth at 15,000 miles an hour , has proved a number of things . By bouncing radio signals back to earth it has demonstrated the feasibility of a new global telephone and television communications system using micro waves . By measuring for the first time the minute air density 1,000 miles above the earth , it has proved that our atmosphere still exists at that altitude . But more than anything else , by its very existence the space balloon has proved that old-fashioned stubborn perseverance is still a 74 POPULAR SCIENCE FEBRUARY 1961 most important element in a technological society . An employee of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , 45-year-old , sandy-haired , chain-smoking William J. O'Sullivan Jr . did n't build Echo I by himself but for years it seemed as if he alone believed in it . This , however , in no way deterred him . He made the creation of inflatable structures in space a personal crusade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridiculous , O'Sullivan heckled , harried , and hornswoggled both those who worked for him and those he worked for . He went through channels , around channels , under channels , and even be- 9  | yond channels to the White House itself , shepherding his crazy idea through years of discouragement as experiment after experiment failed ? until that triumphant August day when millions upon millions of people looking heavenward in Europe , Asia , and North America saw Echo I curve gracefully from horizon to horizon . New world in the sky . O'Sullivan has been looking heavenward since he was a boy in Kentucky . When he took his first plane ride in an open-cockpit plane at 18 , he saw a vision of a new world in the sky to be conquered . At the worst of the depression he turned down a scholarship in archeology at the University of Kentucky " because I do n't want to dig a hole in the ground , I want to dig a hole in the sky , " and went to Notre Dame , where he earned all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last semester , the University administration was shocked to discover that O'Sullivan had taken and passed so many courses that he was entitled to degrees in physics , another in aeronautical engineering , still others in mechanical , chemical , and civil engineering . Somewhere he had broken some rules and beaten the system , but you ca n't punish a boy for being smart . Nevertheless , O'Sullivan 's dean called him in and told him he would have to spend several more years in residence to receive all the degrees ; otherwise he could have only one . O'Sullivan chose aeronautical engineering . After graduation , in the depression year of 1937 , he considered himself fortunate but was amused when he got a job as an insurance actuary and put in some two years figuring fire-insurance rates for the entire state of Kentucky . Then he took Civil Service examinations in aeronautical and mechanical engineering , and landed a job at the national aeronautics research center at Langley Field , Va . He has been hurling himself at the advanced problems of planes , missiles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was five years ago , while he was working with a committee of scientists in Ann Arbor , Mich. , to choose the experiments to be attempted in space during the International Geophysical Year , that O'Sullivan 76 POPULAR SCIENCE FEBRUARY 1961 got his idea for a space balloon . All day long on Jan. 26 , 1956 , the committee considered ways of measuring the density of upper air . This was vital work . Accurate measurement of the thickness of the upper atmosphere would affect the course and design of every missile and satellite . That night O'Sullivan could n't let the problem rest . It seemed to him that none of the proposals seemed to attack the problem effectively . Technically , he was supposed just to judge the suggestions . not to make any of his own , but his brain itched to attack the problem . He yanked out a pad of white lined paper , gripped a pencil , and began a personal assault . He reasoned that if you heaved a large , light object into the air , which would be pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you could measure the push and figure out exactly how much air was in that part of the sky . But how on earth could you get a large object into space when our rockets had not yet orbited a grapefruit-size satellite ? His answers did n't come in a flash . They were the results of hours of muscular thought . O'Sullivan concentrated , sweating out all the combinations of facts that might provide the answer . He worked far harder than if he had been digging a ditch . He forced his experience , his knowledge , and his imagination to their limits . After half the night he came up with a solution . Why not build a large satellite of thin material that could be folded in a nose cone and shot far above the earth @#  | to be expanded there , where the atmosere is thin and would exert little presre on it ? It need not be of rigid metal , furthermore , since at the edge of space it would be able to support itself . Like most really good ideas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been thought of before . O'Sullivan 's hands raced over the paper . Build it of a metal toil , he thought , or a plastic covered with a metal , perhaps lead , which would n't be affected by solar radiation . The lead balloon . O'Sullivan flung himself into bed exhausted , but filled with the satisfaction of a job well done . He could n't sleep , however . He worried about what his fellow scientists would think of his proposal . He spoke aloud , " It will probably go over like a lead balloon ! " and sat up in bed . That was just what he was proposing , was n't it ? Why not lead ? The next day some of the experts who studied his suggestion were dubious about . putting a big bubble in the sky , but others saw its possibilities . There was another problem , however . Experiments with more priority had taken up the relatively tiny area at the top of a Vanguard . There was only a little doughnut of room left over . Could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it weigh no more than seven-tenths of a pound ? He puffed at a cigarette , then nervously rubbed it out . He 'd try that , too . O'Sullivan was off on another crusade . Back at Langley he politicked his superiors into supporting his work , picked a team , and got to work . They tested a hundred plastic and metal foils . The satellite skin would have to be thin , flexible enough to be folded , and yet so tough that it would not tear apart when it was exploded into a sphere . It would have to be rigid when it was inflated . And there was the problem of temperature . The satellite would be outside the protection of the lower atmosphere , and the temperature of sunlight on its surface would be at least 300 degrees Fahrenheit . Minutes later it would whirl into the shadow of the earth , where it would suddenly be cold ? at least 80 degrees below zero . What plastic could stand that ? They found the answer ? Du Pont Mylar , a plastic used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food that you can take out of the freezer and put directly into hot water . It had a tensile strength of 15,000 pounds per square inch , one-third that of mild steel , even when it was manufactured in sheets only .0005 inch thick , half as thick as a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes . All right , that 's solved , now how about the covering ? Some metal would have to protect the satellite against radiation . help it keep its shape , and also make it visible to radar scanners . Metal after metal was tested and ways tried to paint @# 11 @#  | them on Mylar in layers far thinner than air-mail onion-skin paper . Then O'Sullivan heard a rumor that Reynolds Metal Co. had experimented with placing vaporized aluminum on plastic . That proces did the trick . One hour O'Sullivan was in his office at Langley Field , the next he was pacing through the laboratory or the shop ; a few hours later he flew to Washington . He worked nights , weekends ; he pushed hip men ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept government support alive ; he demanded that industry provide solutions to problems it thought unsolvable . How can you find a way to fold a perfect sphere so it can be expanded in a hurry without the single locking fold that would cause it to tear ? Harassed by O'Sullivan , men who could n't fold a road map properly found a way to fold his aluminum balloon . How do you inflate the balloon ? A jigger of air would expand so fast at the edge of space it would blow the satellite apart . When the satellite was shot out of the container , just enough gas had to form inside to inflate it ? not too fast and not too slowly . They tried water , beer , dozens of strange chemicals before they discovered the right combination of sublimating powders that would turn to gas under the temperatures hundreds of miles up . Building a satellite , however , was only part of the job . It had to be tested . Vacuum tanks were designed for the job . When O'Sullivan could n't see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side . The eye could n't follow the sudden explosion of the balloon , so he ordered high-speed strobelight pictures taken . Normal floodlights burst in the vacuum , so then a new lighting rig had to be created . At last O'Sullivan thought his work was finished . He had built a 30-inch satellite that could be squeezed into the cranny he was assigned on a Vanguard . But the rocket was n't ready to be fired . Months passed while the Vanguard project languished . Instead of quitting , O'Sullivan impatiently started campaigning for a 12-foot inflatable satellite ? something the whole only PROTO makes screwdrivers like this  | world could see traveling in sp . O'Sullivan armed himself with th major weapons of persuasion : facts , wt ing models , and conviction . " You do n't just tell people what ought to be done he explains . " You show them how can do it . " Chances and failures . He fought case right up to the White House , with President Eisenhower 's initials c his proposal , the 12-foot inflatable sat lite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 , 1958 . The rocket failed to p the satellite into orbit . Now O'Sullivan 30-inch inflatable sphere was fitted int the nose cone of a Vanguard at Cal Canaveral , the launch button was pushed , and the rocket dribbled into the Atlantic His satellite never had a chance . O'Sullivan was well on the way t what one scientist called " suffering the highest failure rate of any scientist in the satellite field . " The failures were not his fault , but each missed chance to put the satellite into orbit might be O'Sullivan 's last opportunity . White House approval was necessary to get space on a Juno shot . O'Sullivan got it . Juno II carried another 12-foot inflatable satellite , and once more the rocket failed . With each rocket failure O'Sullivan seemed to become more stubborn , more obsessed with his idea . He suffered smiles of amused sympathy and some open scorn in the scientific community . One day a colleague kidded him , " Now that you 've failed with a 30-inch satellite and a 12-footer , what are you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " he answered seriously . " I am going to do just that . " In fact , work had already begun on a huge satellite , 100 feet in diameter . It would be used to test the theory of Dr. J. R. Pierce of Bell Laboratories , Inc. , that signals bounced off passive reflectors in space could provide global telephone and television communications . Testing a 10-story satellite . O'Sullivan was faced with a new problem ? a 10-story-high satellite would have to be tested at the edge of space , for no vacuum tank big enough could be built . A rocket called Shot-Put was designed to do the job . The first time the hundred-footer was fitted into Shot-Put and launched from @#  | Wallops Island the firing went w lw.l , but far up in the air hundreds of sparkling pieces of aluminized plastic were blown out of the inflated satellite and formed a cloud that glinted in the sunset . Something had gone wrong , and the failure was hardly a private one ? the Fourth of July display was seen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of worried phone calls . Now G. T. Schjeldahl Company of Northfield , Minn. , experts in building high-altitude weather balloons , took over construction of the satellite and in six weeks invented a new system of taping the balloon 's seams that made them as tough as its 82 panels . Another test rocket was launched in January , 1960 . The second stage did n't fire . A month later the rocket fired properly , but the test satellite tore . Another rocket was only partially successful , for the satellite carried no tracking beacons . Nevertheless , O'Sullivan figured they were over the hump . Now he had a satellite that could be packed in the nose of a Thor-Delta rocket and placed in orbit 1,000 miles above the earth . The satellite , called Echo , was a miracle of construction . The 31,500-squarefoot surface of Mylar was covered smoothly on both sides with only four pounds of aluminum . It was folded into a sphere 261/2 inches in diameter . The entire satellite , including the 20 pounds of chemicals to inflate it and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar cells and 5 storage batteries , weighed only 132 pounds . On May 13 it was packed in a Thor-Delta . O'Sullivan drank gallons of coffee , chain-smoked pack after pack of cigarettes , and tried , unsuccessfully , not to worry during the countdown of the ThorDelta . Finally , the news came like a blow to the stomach : The rocket had failed . Doggedly , O'Sullivan fought for another try . More memos flew out of Langley . He had strong arguments to answer , and seven failures , even if most of them were not his fault , made him vulnerable . On the last day of May , a fully successful Shot-Put test was completed . But still many authorities were unconvinced . Could it survive ? The nation 's best experts on micrometeorites swore , almost to a man , that the satellite would be punc- @# @#  | tured so many Imes by cosmic dust hitting the thin plastic at 100,000 miles hour , that it would be destroyed wit hours . O'Sullivan refused to be talked out his project . Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed into the nose cone of a 92-foot-high ThorDelta rocket at Cape Canaveral . At 5 : : 39 a.m. it was blasted into the sky . Minutes later Echo I was inflated perfectly , and at 7:41 a recorded message was shot aloft in California and bounced off Echo I to a Bell Laboratory receiver in New Jersey as the satellite passed over the United States . " This is President Eisenhower speaking , " the voice from space said clearly . " This is one more significant step in the United States ' program of space research and exploration . The program is being carried forward vigorously by the United States for peaceful purposes . The satellite balloon , which has reflected these words , may be used freely by any nation for similar experiments in its own interest . " Echo I proved the cosmic-dust experts wrong . There just were n't as many micrometeorites up there as they had guessed . The satellite measured the air density and confirmed the scientists ' theories that our atmosphere , although thin , still exists 1,000 miles above the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the pressure of sunlight is strong enough to push Echo I about 60 miles closer to the earth in a month . For all the world to see . The satellite has also been a significant propaganda weapon for the United States , for people all over the world can look up and see the evidence of our exploration of space with their own eyes . Today Bill O'Sullivan and his Space Vehicle Group have working models of sausage-shaped space stations , weird space antennas , even monstrous kites and gliders , all inflatable in space . He has chemists trying to find ways of using a plastic spray to stiffen a space vehicle once it is inflated . He has others exploring the possibility of creating plastic materials that might swell into a thick , steellike girder when affected by solar radiation . Perhaps O'Sullivan 's most astonishing  | idea is to ' put into orbit a radar dish several mies in diameter . This would be ideal for spaceship communication , and it would be capable of picking up radio waves that can not penetrate the ionosphere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us messages , we might be able to receive them with the monster radar screen . Day after day O'Sullivan arms himself with a pad of paper , grabs a briefcase full of memos , and charges off to argue the possibility of still more " impossible  - -  O'Sullivan ideas . Some of his proposals make people smile , but they pay attention , for 1,000 miles out in space is O'Sullivan 's wonderful lead balloon ? visible evidence that individual perseverance may be the most important element in a technological society . @#
