Guilt is running nudity a close second at theater box offices . Flesh peddling is relatively honest , since it makes no particular pretense of moral grandeur . But when the clink of commerce purports to be the thunder of conscience , all sorts of hypocrisies begin masquerading as virtues . <P> In recent seasons , the guilt peddlers have brought the following wares to the dramatic market : The Deputy , The Investigation , Incident at Vichy , Soldiers , The Man in the Glass Booth , The Great White Hope , In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer and now Indians . These plays have much in common . While an occasional effort is made to specify some individual responsibility for crimes , oppressions , injustices , and atrocities , the dominating j'accuse is hurled at the audience . The audience is presumed to be collectively guilty of every misdeed in recorded history . This is patently absurd . By embracing the abstraction of collective guilt , the playwright performs the singularly irresponsible act of absolving the specifically guilty parties involved . <P> Lesson in Irony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appetite for masochistic self-abasement . It seems bent on atoning for sins it has not committed and receiving the bogus absolution of ex post facto justice dispensed with casuistry and comfort in the theater . No one can bring the 6,000,000 Jews of Europe back to life ; no one can restore dead Indians to their buffalo hunting grounds ; no one can dis-invent the atomic bomb . <P> What , then , does such a playwright think he is doing ? His rationale is that he is providing a cautionary moral lesson drawn from history that will enable people to avoid past errors and evils . Unfortunately , the profoundly ironic lesson of history is that people do repeat the errors and evils of the past , over and over and over again . The reality these playwrights ignore is that man is a finite being , bound always to act and react within the limits of his nature , " a fallen creature " in religious terms . If the human character could be altered and improved by a play , it would have happened ages ago . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women-the greatest and most moving antiwar play ever written . <P> Another rationale such playwrights resort to is that they are alerting the audience 's conscience to contemporary evils . Far from it . These playwrights simply trade on the headlines of the day and gamble that the people they attract will come to the theater precisely because their consciences are on the alert . There is nothing easier than to preach to the already converted . For any but a guilt-collecting audience , most of these plays rate a big B for Boredom . There is no moral suasion in crude hack work that substitutes lapel-grabbing diatribes for scrupulous dramatic craftsmanship . A poor play does not become a good play simply because the playwright 's heart is in the right place .
