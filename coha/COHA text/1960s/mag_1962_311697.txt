The two men chatting last May at the glittering White House dinner for French Minister of Cultural Affairs Andr Malraux found themselves , like many other Americans , discussing the U.S. economy . Both had a good deal to say , and they disagreed in some important particulars . One was President Kennedy . The other was David Rockefeller , 47 , president of the Chase Manhattan Bank ( the nation 's second largest ) , Harvard man , Republican , and younger brother of New York 's Governor . As they talked , the President asked Rockefeller to set down his views about the economy in a personal letter . This week LIFE printed Rockefeller 's letter to Kennedy , together with a reply from the President , in just the sort of serious dialogue that Kennedy has sought to have with the U.S. business community . <P> Vicious Circle . In his letter to Kennedy , Rockefeller expressed confidence " that the thoughts I express are shared widely within the financial and business community , both here and abroad . " To help solve the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting military expenditures abroad , tying more foreign aid to U.S. exports , pushing an export drive , and keeping interest rates firm , or even raising them , to attract investment by foreign capital . But the heart of the problem , said Rockefeller , was the general posture of the U.S. economy , in which he saw " a vicious circle of events ; namely , a constant rise in costs , a squeeze on profits , and a serious lag in investment . " Rockefeller suggested that a thoroughgoing overhaul of the nation 's tax system was essential , but he questioned the Government 's ability to make its planned tax reforms effective while great increases are occurring in Government spending . Said he : " I would urge upon you a more effective control of expenditures and a determined and vigorous effort to balance the budget . Such measures will strengthen confidence everywhere in the future of the dollar . " <P> Kennedy , in his reply , promised to uphold the dollar " with positive solutions . " He ruled out devaluing the dollar or imposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pointed out that the Administration has already cut the dollars spent abroad on defense to $1.7 billion a year , that U.S. Allies are being pressed to increase defense costs , and that the Administration is stepping up its program for increasing exports and attracting foreign visitors and capital to the U.S. <P> To keep the economy healthy and encourage investment , the President said , another inflationary spiral must be prevented : " Our share of the world 's manufactured exports declined in the 1953-60 period by nearly 16%-at the same time that our prices on these products , relative to those of other industrialized nations , increased 14% . " To ease the profit squeeze and encourage investment in modernization-thus helping to cut costs and raise exports-he had proposed a new tax credit and a revision of the Treasury 's depreciation rules that together would mean a " tax cut " for U.S. businessmen of $2.5 billion .
