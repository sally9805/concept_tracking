txt The strike of 9,000 electrical construction workers here ended last night when three hold-out associations of contractors agreed to a basic five-heur day . Mayor Wagner announced the settlement after a meeting with union and employer representatives at Gracie Mansion . He then went on to a dinner of the Building Trades Employers Association at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel , where he reported that the city 's construction industry would be back to normal today . Thousands of workers were laid off yesterday because of the tie-up . The achievement of the fivehour day by Local 3 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers , headed by Harry Van Arsdale Jr. , its business manager , was regarded as a major bargaining breakthrough for labor . Reputation at Stake Mr. Van Arsdale , who is also president of the million-member City Central Labor Council , had staked his reputation on a campaign for a shorter work week . The stocky , white-haired , 53-year-old union leader was said to have had two major objectives in striving for a five-hour day . One was a desire to protect his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to advance himself as a national labor figure , possibly as the successor to George Meany as president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations . The first break in employer resistance to the shorter work week came late Wednesday night . The Greater New York Electrical Contractors Association , representing 120 employers and 3,000 workers , agreed then to a five-hour day . Talks Broken Off Three other employer groups , headed by Efrem A. Kahn , continued to resist . They offered a 10 per cent wage increase with no cut in hours . This proposal was summarily rejected by Local 3 , and the talks were broken off . Yesterday the three associations went into sessions at the offices of the Building Trades Employers Association , 711 Third Avenue . Late in the afternoon they transferred their meeting to Gracie Mansion , where they discussed the situation further with the Mayor and Harold A. Felix , the city 's Labor Commissioner . It was there that they reached their decision to follow the fivehour pattern . However , one consideraton still stood in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insistence by other building trades that they must be paid for the time lost as the result of the shutdown called yesterday by contractors . Leaders of the city 's 132 building unions had served notice that they would not send their thousands of members back to work ? no matter when the electrical ended  --  unless they were paid for the time they had been laid off . The unions had called the stoppage an illegal lockout and a breach of their contract . Word of the problem was relayed by telephone from Gracie Mansion to the dinner of the Building Trades Employers Association at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel . H. Earl Fullilove , chairman of ! the association 's board of gov-1 ernors , went from table to table at the dinner , rounding up al quorum to make a decision on l the request for back pay . Hel was finally able to amass enough , votes in a side room and there the decision was made to pay the workers for the time they had lost yesterday . Despite the action , the building employers were not happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " any reason to agree to a shorter work week . " However , he added , " as long as one electrical association had given in , the deal had to go through , and the other associations were forced to go along . " Mayor Wagner ran into some vocal opposition when he appeared at the dinner a few minutes later . He told the large audience that he had not thought the union 's position on the shorter work week a good one . Nevertheless he was greeted with boos . " I 'm the first Mayor who has no obligations to anyone during my term of office , " he said . " How about Harry Van Arsdale ? " a voice cried . " I do n't believe it , " said another . The Maybr won applause , however , when he said : " I understand your feelings very well and I accept them . I know you have every right to feel and express yourselves . When we do so , we are expressing our democratic rights . " The new thirty-month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9,000 workers employed by 600 electrical employers will actually cost the union members $3.80 a week . Under the old agreement they worked six hours a day at $4.40 an hour and a seventh hour at time and a half , or $6.60 . This came to $165 for a thirty-fivehour week . Under the new contract they will work five hours a day at $4.96 an hour and a sixth hour at time and a half , or 57.44 . The total for a thirtyhour week will be $161.20 . The union had originally demanded a four-hour day . The new contract will run until June 30 , 1963 . However , the provision for a shorter work week will not go into effect until next July 1 . Until then all terms of the old agreement will prevail . The union also won a third week of vacation after twentyfive years . The effects of the shutdown yesterday were difficult to gauge . Mr. Fullilove estimated that half of the city 's 200,000 building workers had been furloughed , but he called it a " guess at best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at every building site . For another , the cold weather would have kept many crafts from their jobs in any case . The building trades council had filed unfair labor practices charges against the employers and had announced its intentions of filing suit against them for alleged breach of contract . The employers said they had decided to shut down because the strike had threatened the safety of other workers , was economically unfeasible and was illegal . Industry negotiators were particularly concerned about whether Local 3 would be able to supply sufficient labor to make a basic five-hour day possible . The union had found it necessary to import 2,250 workers from outside the city to meet manpower demands under the old seven-hour day . Mr. Van Arsdale , in announcing the partial settlement Wednesday , promised full cooperation with management to keep labor costs .. down . He pledged to continue the limitation of fifteen hours of overtime in any week by a union member . In addition , Mr. Van Arsdale said his union would seek immediately to recruit 1.000 apprentices to be added to the 1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . He did not say where he proposed to find the men . Whether the five-hour day would also become a pattern for other building unions was unclear . Present contracts between most of the eighteen major crafts and the employers do not expire until June 30 , 1963 . Agreements between contractors and the Pla , -. terers Union and the Bricklayers Union run out in May , but the former group already works only six hours a day .
