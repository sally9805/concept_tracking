The rulers of Red China came as close as they dared to a public admission of failure . <P> For three weeks , the National People 's Congress met in secret in Peking . In the vast , modernistic Great Hall of the People , 1,027 delegates gathered to hear the new line . Premier Chou En-lai and other top brass were seated beneath a tan , tasseled curtain bedecked with the huge , five-starred Red Chinese seal of state . All foreigners were barred , even representatives of Peking 's one dependable European ally , little Albania . <P> Finally last week , Peking published a summary of Premier Chou En-lai 's state of the nation speech to the Congress . Chou announced that China 's economy had " begun to take a turn for the better . " but this tepid claim was not supported by statistics of any kind , much less by the grandiose and Utopian figures that were trumpeted to the world in 1960 . Chou blamed China 's food shortage on " serious natural calamities , " and dwelt far more on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> New Order . Premier Chou submitted a ten-point program to the Congress ; even in its vague generalities , translators of Communist doublespeak find admissions of China 's severe economic crisis . Instead of the old slogans about " 20 years of progress in a single day ! " , there seemed little hope now of doing more than feeding and clothing the Chinese people and supplying them with the barest necessities . The Communist leaders completely reversed the old policy of giving priority to heavy industry , which had nearly wrecked China 's agriculture ; the new demand was for " all-round balance " between branches of the economy " in the order of agriculture , light industry and heavy industry . " <P> Another Red backdown came on the " bourgeois " front . During the big drive to nationalize China 's factories in 1956 , their original owners were given monthly interest payments in return for " advice " on plant operation . The payments were scheduled to stop this year . Instead , Chou 's program deems it necessary to " unite the patriotic elements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years . <P> With its home sector in disarray , there was some evidence that Red China may be willing to resolve its ideological quarrel with the Soviet Union . Before the Congress . Chou En-lai protested that China , as always , was " firmly and unswervingly " a friend of Russia , paid lip service to the Khrushchev line-usually derided in China-of peaceful coexistence with non-Communist countries . <P> Sought Fissures . A Soviet trade mission concluded a new economic agreement for 1962 with Peking last week . China will exchange tin , mercury , wool , silk fabrics , readymade clothes and handicrafts for Russian oil products , chemicals , trucks , scientific instruments and machinery parts . Significantly , China undertakes to export no food , and the Russians apparently were supplying little or no equipment related to heavy industry .
