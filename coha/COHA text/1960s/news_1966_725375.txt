txt MONTGOMERY , Ala. , March 2 ? Alabama Negroes , many of them barred from even voting a year ago , are seeking elective offices in every county in which their race is in the majority . The magnitude of their at-1 tempt to wrest the state 's 11-1 county " Black Belt " from white , political dominance becamei known today when county probate judges issued the names of Democratic primary candidates who qualified before the midnight filing deadline yesterday . The list showed Negroes running for at least 33 offices , including sheriff and state legislator , in the Black Belt , or well over half the offices up for election in the region this year . The lists were limited to Democratic candidates and thus did not include possible Republican candidates . It also did not include Lowndes County Negroes who are bypassing the Democratic'primary to run as . candidates of the Lowndes County Freedom Organization , an all-Negro political party that has adopted the black ruither as its symbol . In addition to the Black Belt drives , Negroes have qualified as candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority . Negroes are also attempting // to elect a state senator from a district that embraces Monroe County . That county is predominantly Negro but is not counted as part of the state 's Black Belt , a designation that applies to the color of the county 's soil as well , as to its population . The Negro candidates plunged into the race as a direct result I of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , which thus far has added approximately 100,000 Negroes to the voting rolls in Alabama , bringing the total to 190-200,000 . In Wilcox County , for example , there were no registered Negro voters a year ago , but Negroes now outnumber whites on the rolls and are attempting to elect a sheriff , a tax assessor , two county commission , ers and a state senator . Citing current voter registration figures , civil rights workers regard Negroes as favorites to win the Democratic norriinations in as many as 20 races ? including four sheriffs races ? in Wilcox , Macon , Sumter , Greene , Bullock and Perry ' Counties in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predominantly Negro counties , however , and whites still have voting majorities . Because of multi-county legislative districts that spill out of the Black Belt , prospects are also dim for most Negro candidates for the approximately one dozen legislative seats they are seeking . Meanwhile , both Negroes and whites are awaiting a decision from a three-member panel of Federal judges on the state 's 1 ; 1,50 poll tax . If the poll tax were declared illegal , this would increase the prospect of a heavy Negro voter turnout and add . to the worries of white segregationists . " This business of so . many colored ' people running is really shaking the people up , " said one probate judge from a . predominantly Negro county . " I do n't like : it either , but do n't quote me ' by name . I 'm up for election in 1970 , and I 'll have to have , votes from both ' sides if I 'm going to win . " Albert Turner , state director of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the State House of Representatives from a predominantly Negro district ; said his organization " could have gotten a good many more ? candidates to run " but decided against seeking every office . Negro candidates are after the sheriff 's office and a majority of seats on the County Board of Revenue and three other major offices in Macon County , the home of Tuskegee Institute , but some are being opposed by Negro leaders who favor a " coalition " government with whites . In Dallas County , which has Selma as its county seat and was the center of the Negroes ' campaign fo'l the Voting Rights Law , Negroes are running for a seat in the Legislature , tax collector and two places on the Board of Revenue , the county governing body . But they kept out of the sheriff 's race to support Selma 's Public Safety Director , Wilson Baker , in his effort to oust Sheriff James G. Clark , one of the South 's most militant segregationists.               @ @ @ @ @ @
