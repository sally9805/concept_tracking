Blinded by the TV images of Valachi and Mme. Nhu , a bemused American public is hardly aware that we have entered into a closer alliance ' with Franco 's Spain . The signing in New York on September 26 of a new agreement between this country and Spain ? dubbed an agreement so as to avoid the complicationsof treaty ratification ? has been acclaimed in Spain as a triumph for Franco , as indeed it is . The agreement in effect establishes a mutual alliance ; any threat to the security and integrity of either country or to joint facilities that " each provides for the common defense " is a matter of common concern , calling for appropriate action . For Spain the most likely threat would be internal , yet some of the funds we will give Franco will be used to modernize-the Spanish Army  --  the better to prepare it to put down internal riots or possible insurrections in Ceuta and Melilla . The agreement is Preposterous as well as morally offensive because Russia was never less of a threat to Europe than at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred , on the Sino-Soviet border in 1962 ; the Soviets are reported to have shifted forces from the Western front to guard the long border with China . At the same time , we are withdrawing some 5,400 troops from France as part of a program to streamline military supply lines in Europe . The three Strategic Air Command bases in Spain have themselves largely been made obsolete by intercontinental bombers and missiles . The , new rationale is that we need the naval installations at Rota to service Polaris submarine tenders . Not only is the bases agreement extended for five years , but we will be pouring $100 million . into Spain . . For Franco the agreement is a windfall , for us a liability ; we got a keg of nails and the odium of acquiring as an ally a regime that our other Western allies have several times blackballed for membership in NATO , but Franco got $100 million , a bilateral alliance with this country , and the prestige of a diplomatic triumph . And we used to be regarded as shrewd bargainers ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done in many countries , also speaking on radio and TV ) , and not go marching and demonstrating . But the increasing size of the Aldermaston March compelled the press , radio and TV to report CND . The 1962 demonstration , which was really vast , was the greatest triumph of this idea . And this was when it should have ended . This year 's march did CND more harm than good , for reasons that will appear . I need not dwell on the fact that the Labour Conference , under Hugh Gaitskell 's impassioned direction , finally rejected unilateralism . It is already well known . What is not widely understood , however , is that this attempt to capture the Labour Party was by no means the be-all and end-all of CND 's existence . It is a mistake to estimate the movement in too narrow political terms . One of its main objects ? and the one I cared most about ? was to educate public opinion , which had been almost entirely at the mercy of pro nuclear propaganda . And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge meetings in the cities but also through the thousands of tiny meetings organized by CND 's many hundreds of local branches I say that we changed the climate of opinion in England . I know this because I know what it was like when we began the campaign and had to meet opposing opinion head-on . Innumerable " sane , level-headed " men gradually began to adopt the ideas originally denounced , as the thinking of crackpots . The very newspapers that first boycotted us now often write as we had written and talked . I do not say they turned unilateral , but there was a definite shift in their attitude toward nuclear weapons and the testing and piling up of them . CND had not toiled in vain . It moved too slowly , however , for some people , mostly young but spectacularly led by Earl Russell . They wanted civil disobedience , arrests by the police , trials and fines and if necessary ? for they were genuinely courageous ? prison sentences . So the Committee of 100 was formed . ( A smaller " Direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) The earlier and larger demonstrations of the committee certainly obtained a great deal of publicity , some of it hostile , some of it grudgingly respectful . The committee was not a branch of CND , which had never accepted the policy of civil disobedience ; it was an entirely separate organization ; and some of its leaders rather disliked CND , and especially showed hostility toward the chairman , Canon Collins . Now John Collins is a close friend of mine , and I know him a great deal better than the people who write and talk about him . I know that he is deeply and selflessly devoted to the causes he adopts but is quite free from fanaticism and has a very real feeling for people . He has in fact the essential Christian virtues together with their defects . He is too optimistic ; he clis-252 likes taking a firm line ; he is tolerant past the point where toleration ceases to be reasonable . On the other hand , he is a skillful and experienced chairman and committee man , and has kept CND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have done . He has been like a man condemned to trot along a winding lane holding an eight-foot jellyfish fully capable of stinging . him . What has been called " the umbrella policy " of CND reflects Canon Collins ' temperament , tolerance and anxiety to keep the movement in being . The idea is that it should not sharply disassociate itself from , but indeed share some of its resources with , any group working for nuclear disarmament , even though the particular activities of the group do not fall in line with CND 's own policy . This has not worked well . During the last twelve months , CND has lost rather than gained ground . This year 's Aldermaston March was on the whole damaging to CND 's public image , chiefly because the groups taking advantage of " the umbrella , " joining the march but then behaving as they saw fit , did the movement more harm than good . It is a mistake , however , to imagine that CND is suffering from Communist infiltration . It is simply not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the umbrella . " The groups that tend to work the mischief are made up of quite different types , and the present position of CND can not be understood unless we take a look at these groups. , There are , first , the out-and-out fanatical pacifists who can not be satisfied with anything short of , total disarmament . They refuse to make any compromises . They will not budge an inch . They are not for the most part busy intriguers , but they do provide a kind of stiff , leaden opposition to any realistic policy . The next group is smaller but influential if only because it consists of people who never stop meeting and talking and planning . They are the people who want , to play politics all the time . They are often personally ambitious . They regard CND not as an instrument by means of which British unilateral nuclear disarmament might be achieved , but as a field in which their hitherto unrecognized political talent might be offered plenty of scope . They are entirely different in temperament and outlook from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and power simply because they never do stop meeting and talking , plotting and planning . And they can not help wanting to turn CND into some sort of vague political party , something that was never intended . The third , group , which is prob-ably growing fast , is of more importance than the other two , and so deserves a closer . examination . It consists chiefly of young people , who have a strong if unfocused rebelliousness , though it is led , so far as it can be led , by some older and cooler types . These last have some sort of political philosophy , believing as they do that our parliamentary democratic system has outlasted its usefulness and is ' now a fake and a fraud . ( The conduct of our Tory government , which in all decency ought to have resigned months ago , but which will not go to the country until its public-opinion experts advise it to , undoubtedly encourages this cynicism about parliamentary government . ) These . people believe in civil disobedience and " direct action " not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new kind of general political action , which in the end will make parliamentary government impossible . The more extreme of them ? a tiny number but by no means without influence ? are really making use of CND and its large " umbrella " for their own ends . And it is they ? though they are not alone in this ? who proclaim that what they call " the old guard " in CND should now make way for youth and enthusiasm and a new - tough line . This idea is not without support among the headquarters staff of CND and the persons who write The NATION for Sanity , the monthly periodical now selling , I understand , between 30,000 and 40,000 copies . And now we arrive at the recent decision , spotlighted in the press , of many of the more important members of CND not to allow themselves to be nominated , at the forthcoming annual conference , for membership in the council and the executive . Here we will have to make a distinction between Labour M.P.s such as Anthony Greenwood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latter no longer wish to serve on the council or the ex-executive because they feel the " umbrella " policy of CND makes them in part responsible for all manner of actions taken by the three groups I have already noted , actions of which they strongly disapprove . On the other hand , the Labour members declare that the forthcoming general election will leave them no time for CND work . But this is not the whole story , for I am sure these Labour members feel that a CND connection might be a serious embarrassment during the election . After all , there is one small splinter group , INDEC , which actually ( and idiotically , in my opinion ) wants to put up CND parliamentary candidates . Three events could happen during the next two months . Canon Collins , still the key figure , could offer himself for re-election as chairman on the understanding that the " umbrella " policy is considerably modified and there is a showdown with the hostile groups . This would largely return CND to its original task of educating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling the critics of " the old guard " to accept responsibility and make use of the movement as they please . Or vague , soothing words could be uttered at the annual conference , with no showdown , and CND ( now short of money ) could wobble along toward gradual disintegration . Of these three choices ? but remember I write as one of the oldest of " the old guard " ? it seems to me that the first is the best . It would keep the mass movement in being until after the general election ( and what happens at the election is of enormous importance to CND ) ; and while improving its public image , not improved by unnecessary demonstrations made by the wilder young people , it could again begin educating , instead of flaunting , public opinion . One final point . CND worked hard to achieve a European federation of anti-nuclear movements . It looked like succeeding . But the intervention at various levels of the three hostile groups , together with some encouragement of them from headquarters staff , has brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace movements of any and every kind , that has gravely endangered the previous federation and so ' far achieved precious little else . What these movements need , at home or abroad , are a few more cool heads and a lot less hotheads . We have a better chance of compelling our government to behave sensibly if we behave sensibly ourselves .
