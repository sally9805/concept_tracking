Emerson called him " the greatest writer who ever lived . " Claudel considered him a " great solemn ass . " Jung pronounced him " a prophet . " Evelyn Waugh dismissed him as a " wayward dabbler in philosophy . " Valery said he was " one of the luckiest throws that fate has ever allowed the human race to make . " <P> The enormous enigma of Johann Wolfgang Goethe has bewildered and fascinated two centuries of Western culture . In Germany he is worshiped as a demi-divinity ; Albert Schweitzer , for instance , modeled much of his life on Goethe 's . Yet in the English-speaking world his works are very little read . The Goethe of transatlantic reputation is the plaster Zeus of Weimar who thundered at secretaries and toadied to princes ( " Blessed are those who draw near to the great of this world ! " ) . Of his works , only Faust is famous , largely because Charles Gounod made grand opera of it , and only a few of his finest lyrics have survived the assaults of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long relegation to librarefied limbo may be ending . In 1962 , Poet W. H. Auden published a handsome translation of his Italian Journey . In 1963 , Poetess Louise Bogan collaborated with Elizabeth Mayer on a readable resetting of Elective Affinities . Poet Louis MacNeice , before his death , released a version of Faust that is uniformly the finest in the language . And Poets Robert Lowell , Stephen Spender and Randall Jarrell are all hard at work on English versions of Goethe 's verse . <P> Titan with Warts . What has been badly needed to give form and focus to the Goethe revival is an important new biography , and Critic Richard Friedenthal has now provided it . In his Goethe ( World ; $8.50 ) , a best seller in German and the first major book about Goethe to be published in English in nearly 20 years , he takes a hard cold look at the legendary giant of German literature , and he sees , along with a startling collection of warts , a man of universal genius . <P> Goethe was a notable philosopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a stylist second to none in German literature , a major novelist and dramatist , and probably the most richly expressive lyric poet who ever lived-a genius who differed in kind but not in degree from Dante and Shakespeare . He wrote a hundred times more than either of them-his collected works fill 150 volumes-and consequently more of what he wrote is dated ; The Sorrows of Young Werther , for instance , reads in this unsentimental century like soap opera written in gold ink . But his finest works-Iphigenia , Tasso , Elective Affinities-embrace a massive range of experience , and in them all the print still lies warm on the page . Finally there is Faust , a masterpiece more than 60 years in the making , in which Goethe presents a central image of Western civilization and a hero who still stands as the type and template of modern man .
