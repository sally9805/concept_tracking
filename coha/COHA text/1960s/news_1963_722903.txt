txt KENNEDY 'S PROPOSALS for farm legislation fact slow going In Congress . This year 's key issues involve cotton , milk and feed grains . The President discussed remedies only in general terms in his farm message last week ; detailed proposals are still to come . He urged enactment of a new cotton bill by the end of February , before planting of the 1963 crop starts . But opinion is sharply divided in the cotton industry over complicated details of an Administration plan to lower cotton prices to domestic mills so they can compete with lower-priced imported textiles . Any new cotton law seems sure to miss Kennedy 's deadline . Chances of enactment this year of even voluntary Federal restraints on milk output are remote Dairying returns about $5 billion a year in income to farmers And many cling to the present at rangement of no Federal control on production .

Domestic whiskey loses ground to imports , vodka and gin Consumption slipped to 69% of the total for all spirits in 1962 from 73.3% five years ago .

COMMODITY PRICES both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commodity Index , a yardstick of raw material prices in the U.S. , yesterday stood at 151.08% of the 1924.26 average , the highest in over 21z years . Reuters ' Index , which measures world commodity prices , yesterday was 450.9% of the Sept. 18 , 1931 base , the highest since August 1957 .

Huge demand has hefted soybean prices to about $2.71 a bushel at Chicago from $2.41 at the start of the season Oct. 1 . So the Government now makes a profit of around 5 cents a bushel on the beans . Federal stocks now total about 3 million bushels ; at the beginning of the season , holdings were 40 million . Bean profits are paltry alongside the $250 million-a-month loss on disposal of all-farm surpluses . ? ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rein on prices . The Government has so much corn and other feed grains that the rate at which these surplus holdings are marketed is a major factor governing prices . Federal surplus managers paid farmers $850 million for idling feed grain land in 1962 ; the Government can sell surplus teed grains at market levels until it recoups this amount . In the early part of the current season , which started Oct. 1 . surplus feed grain sales averaged about 12 million bushels weekly . Sales last week were nearly 19 million . Even so , Federal officials say , total surplus corn sales for the year ending Sept. 30 probably wo n't exceed 700 million , or around 215 million less than the record set in 1961-62 . No. 2 yellow corn now sells for about $1.20 a bushel in Chicago . 9 cents more than a year ago . Domestic use and exports of feed grains this season run at a higher level than 196 ! production . This tends to push prices upward despite heavy Government sales . ? ? ?
