The opera at Milan 's La Scala last week was Verdi 's Battle of Legnano , and the principals bore glittering reputations - Soprano Antonietta Stella , Tenor Franco Corelli . But as anxious to please as either of them were the two men posted on either side of the first gallery ( the fifth tier ) . Antonio Carrara , 33 , and Carmelo Alabisio , 76 , can lay claim to being opera 's most successful dispensers of professional applause . <P> Carrara and Alabisio are the organizers of the La Scala claque . At a time when claques are disappearing from many of the world 's opera houses , the La Scala group is one of the best in the house 's long history . At a signal , 30 hand-clappers burst into applause , almost always sweeping a large part of the audience with them . Says Carrara : " The claque is absolutely necessary , not only for the artists , but because some operas are so boring that nobody would clap if we did n't boost up the atmosphere . " <P> Duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opera houses , none in years have been organized with the same flair and genius for detail . A onetime aspiring singer , Carrara abandoned his career when his money ran out , now works during the day as a salesman , has been claquing evenings for ten years . Alabisio was a top La Scala tenor under Toscanini in the 1920s . Their basic claque ( which they can beef up to 40 on important evenings ) includes singing students , teachers , music lovers and two barbers . Perhaps the most dedicated is Claqueur Nino Grassi , 60 , who has clapped professionally at La Scala since he was ten years old . Carrara and Alabisio attend every La Scala dress rehearsal , talk to the leading singers to find out if they want applause at unexpected places , finally discuss the completed applause script with the conductor to make sure that it will not interrupt his inspiration . ( The one person whom even the most skillful claqueur can not beat is a conductor determined to drown applause with a full orchestra . ) <P> Clapping fees remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directors alone are paid , while subordinates clap merely for admission . A certain amount of applause comes free . " Naturally , when an artist pays , we feel like applauding stronger , " says Carrara , " but even if he does n't pay , we still applaud because it is our duty to keep up the atmosphere and spirit of the performance . " Most Italian singers approve of the claque , but as a general rule other European singers and Americans resent it . Soprano Leontyne Price has even paid the claque not to applaud .
