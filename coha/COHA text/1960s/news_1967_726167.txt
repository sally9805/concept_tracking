Bennett , Republican of Utah , the vice chairman , said that Mr. Dodd was notified of the date on Feb. 15 through his counsel , John F. Sonnett . Senator Stennis and Senator Bennett said that Senator Dodd and Mr. Sonnett had rejected the committee 's offer to stipulate certain facts before the hearing began . In turn , they said , the committee rejected the Senator 's " counteroffer of a stipulation . " For some weeks Benjamin R. Fern , counsel of the ethics committee , which is formally known as the Select Senate Committee on Standards and Conduct , has been trying to reach agreement with Mr. Sonnett , head of the New York firm of Cahill , Gordon , Sonnett , Reindel &; Ohl , on facts to be stipulated and thus not subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that the committee , particularly its members who are lawyers , were angered yesterday by the stipulation proposed by Mr. Dodd and Mr. Sonnett on Feb. 27 . The committee , these sources said , was asked not simply to stipulate facts but to agree " to Senator Dodd 's conclusions from the facts " and his own assess // HEARINGS ON DODD TO OPEN MARCH 13 // ment as to whether he had diverted to his own use the proceeds of several testimonial dinners between 1961 and 1965 . This charge , made over a year ago by the Washington columnists , Drew Pearson and Jack Anderson , led to a request by Mr. Dodd for an investigation by the ethics committee . In his proposed stipulation , Mr. Dddd conceded that he had used the proceeds of the testimonials to pay , personal debts and expenses . But he also wanted the committee to agree to his contention that he had a right to do this because the , purchasers of the tickets had intended the proceeds to be a " personal gift " and not a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinners was intended , as gifts , the proceeds need not be reported as income .

The senatorial sources also said that Mr. Sonnett had asked ) the committee to " impeach " as witnesses James P. Boyd Jr. , Mrs. Majorie A. Carpenter and Michael V. O'Hare . Mr. Boyd was formerly Mr. Dodd 's administrative assistant , Mrs. Carpenter his secretary and Mr. O'Hare an office aid " in charge of his accounts . L. hearings last summer , the three testified that they had taken records from the Senator 's files and given them to Mr. Pearson and Mr. Anderson for copying . Should the committee agree to Mr. Dodd 's suggestion of impeachment , the three can not be called as witnesses .

The stipulation then said : " It is the position of Senator Dodd that , with the exception of $5,000 erroneously deposited in his testimonial account in 1965 , he was entitled to use the entire $170,319.85 as he saw fit since it constituted a personal gift to him , He was so advised by counsel with regard to the first testimonial event which was held on Nov. 21 , 1961 . " It is the position of Senator Dodd that although he was entitled to use the entire $170 , - 319.85 as he saw fit , in fact not more than $30,000 was used for the payment of personal expenses and the balance was used for the payment of political expenses , or the repayment of debts which had accumulated in the course of his political career and as part of that career . " According to senatorial informants , the committee will , disfi pute this contention in the be- ' lief that Mr. Dodd used far more than $30,000 for personal expenses .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
