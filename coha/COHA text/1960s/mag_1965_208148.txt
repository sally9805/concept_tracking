" We 're already aiding the Vietnamese in 1,001 ways . But let 's not be satisfied when it might prove that the 1,002nd way is the decisive one . " <P> Ever since he spoke those words on his arrival in Saigon last July as the new U.S. ambassador , Maxwell Taylor has been looking for that decisive-and elusive-1,002nd way . As of last week , he seemed to be no closer to finding it than when he started . He was locked in an extraordinary battle with the Vietnamese army he was supposed to be " aiding , " most notably with Lieut . General Nguyen Khanh . In a deliberate and perhaps desperate move , Taylor was ready to risk an ultimate break with the Vietnamese army in order to lay down the U.S. law and bring about something like a stable government in South Viet Nam . <P> Word from Saigon was that Taylor was determined to force Khanh out as army commander-in-chief and was trying to split him off from " young Turk " generals who two weeks ago , with Khanh 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( TIME , Jan. 1 ) . Washington , on the other hand , insisted that a compromise was being worked out with Khanh to restore a greater measure of civilian government . <P> Whatever the outcome of all this maneuvering , it was startling to recall that only last spring Defense Secretary Robert McNamara had said : " If Khanh goes , the U.S. will need a new Secretary of Defense . " <P> Last Battle . The conflict between Taylor and Khanh is partly one of principle , partly one of personality . A soldier for 40 years , Taylor led the 101st Airborne Division at Normandy , was superintendent of West Point , commanded U.S. troops in postwar Berlin and during the Korean war . In 1959 , he quit as Army Chief of Staff because President Eisenhower 's defense advisers , sold on the massive-retaliation theory , ignored his demands for a " flexible defense " capable of handling everything down to limited guerrilla actions . President Kennedy called him back to duty in 1961 , made him his personal military adviser , then chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up that job and go to Saigon as ambassador . " He could have stayed on another two years as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs , " says a Pentagon official , " and retired at the end of a glorious career . Instead , he went out to his last battle without much hope of winning . " <P> But Taylor must have entertained at least some hope when he went to Saigon , for he was the chief architect of the current U.S. program there . After a 1961 fact-finding mission to Saigon , Taylor convinced Kennedy that with a drastic step-up in aid the U.S. could still win out in Viet Nam . When he returned to Saigon as ambassador , he began to learn grimly that things were considerably more complicated than that . Moving into a white , French-style villa near a cemetery , he plunged into a 70-hour-a-week work schedule , set about reorganizing the complex and often conflicting U.S. mission , a job that had been started by his predecessor , Henry Cabot Lodge . <P> Through the summer , until Khanh relinquished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riots , Taylor went through long and brittle sessions with the testy little general .
