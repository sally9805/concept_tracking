" Reminded that in a telegram yesterday to President Eisenhower the Senator had expressed hope that the President 's long experience could be drawn upon , - the Senator was asked what he had in mind . - Senator Kennedy replied that he had " had some , thoughts " about what to ' ask the President to do but that he weuld wait until their forthcoming meeting . As for offering some position to Vice President Nixon , as suggested by Senator Mike Mansfield , Democrat of Montana , Senator Kennedy said that he hoped to have a chance td talk to Mr. Nixon before Inauguration Day and that he did not want to say anything before then .

Today 's news conference was handled under White House rules , with- newsmen locked in the armory during the confer- ' ence and not allowed to transmit reports until it was over . But Mr. Salinger made a few departures from White House tradition . The transcript of Mr. Kennedy 's remarks was not edited , and neither were the television tapes . Also it was not necessary for reporters to identify themselves when asking questions . But Mr. Salinger said this last concession was not to be interpreted as a precedent . It was reported today that rich contributors to Democratic , campaign funds could expect no prior consideration in plush diplomatic posts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had offered campaign money on the condition that they be made ' ambassadors were told to keep their money .

A top aide said : " There 's going to be a revolution in the people we send abroad to represent us : The Senator wants people with new spirit and Vigor , hard workers instead of the , 9 to 5 o'clock ' type . Such diplomatic posts as London , Paris , Rome , Madrid have nearly always been given as prizes to rich contributors . of confidence in the Central Intelligence Agency . " Mr. Hoover , who will remain as director of the F. B. I .. , expressed similar sentiments . " I , of course , am highly honored that President-elect Kennedy has - asked me to remain as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , " he said .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
