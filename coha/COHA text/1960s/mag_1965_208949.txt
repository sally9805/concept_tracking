Eight Uruguayan officials , led by Agriculture Minister Wilson Ferreira Aldunate , walked uneasily into a private office at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York one day last week , unpacked their briefcases , charts and account books , and for 2 hours pleaded for help from representatives of seven metropolitan banks . The same day , the Uruguayans shuttled to Washington for similar meetings with officers at the International Monetary Fund , Inter-American Development Bank and Inter-American Committee for the Alliance for Progress . The sad truth , only too obvious to the bankers , was that tiny Uruguay is almost flat broke , and , like a householder who is already up to his ears in debt , was finding it increasingly difficult to raise fresh cash . <P> The seeds of the present crisis go back to the early 1900s , when a young reform-minded President named Jos Battle y Ordez started the country on a spree of welfare-statism . He and his successors set up workmen 's compensation , minimum-wage and old-age-pension plans , organized a sprawl of government industries ( insurance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effort to guarantee democracy-replaced Uruguay 's one-man presidency with a nine-man National Council . As benefits piled on benefits , the Council became less a government than a gigantic octopus that today is drowning in its own ink . To meet rising annual deficits , the government simply has printed more money , has run the foreign debt to an unwieldy $500 million , of which $80 million is already overdue this year . Largely as a result , the once-proud peso in the past five years fell from 9 to 1 and the cost of living quadrupled . <P> To tide the country over into next year , the Council recently asked the National Assembly to authorize another $94 million in new currency . Last week the Council had to settle for only $28 million- " barely enough , " snorted Finance Minister Daniel H. Martins , " to cover our needs until September . " Many Uruguayans agreed . University students demonstrated angrily in downtown Montevideo , and thousands of government employees staged a series of brief protest strikes . Uruguay 's immediate object in sending its eight-man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debts rescheduled and to arrange for additional loans . The country 's past record has made Washington leary . Before any further credit can be considered , the U.S. wants to see a broad program of economic reform in Uruguay . New York banks are of the same mind .
