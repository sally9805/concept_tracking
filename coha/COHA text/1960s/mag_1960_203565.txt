Henry IV , Part II follows Part I into the Phoenix Theater with much the same general success . It is far less often performed than what is popularly regarded as its better half , but it ill deserves neglect . Beyond its own rich claim to recognition , it forms with Part I something vastly and variedly Shakespearean . The two Parts , moreover , are in organic relationship and poignant contrast . And though there is considerably less history in Part II , there is actually more history in the making . <P> Falstaff very much holds the stage here , now in witty talk of this or that , now in tavern scenes with Doll Tearsheet or Mistress Quickly , now in his travels through the Gloucestershire of Shallow and Silence . He is still marvelously exuberant , ingenious , incorrigible , but his revels are now ending . He and his cronies , whether sluts or simpletons , are tarnished with age and touched with pathos . But . more than that . Henry IV draws near his end , and soon a playboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , against the last thinned merrymaking of rascals , counterposes the making of a king . The self-condemning new voung monarch is suddenly self-reformed , is indeed a little holier-than-thou , and a great deal royaler , as he moves forward toward what , in Henry V , will be Shakespeare 's most blazing success story . Falstaff , where the destiny of princes and the history of England are concerned , is but an incident . And so , in a wrenching , cruelly realistic scene , the young King before whom Falstaff has jubilantly knelt cries out . " I know thee not , old man , " banishing him forever . <P> The warmth of the play 's humor is the lustier for the chill in the air , and Falstaff is almost the nimbler with his fortunes in decline . As in Part I , Eric Berry plays Falstaff with , fine , resourceful gusto ; among his playmates , Gerry Jedd 's Mistress Quickly , Franklin Cover 's Silence and Ray Reinhardt 's Pistol are all good , and John Heffernan 's Shallow something better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and magic . The royal scenes , full of a rhetoric that needs a humanizing voice , fare a good deal less well . But where humor and humanity cooperate . Stuart Vaughan 's staging is dynamic , and the two parts of Henry IV play a rewarding part in a largely unrewarding theatrical season .
