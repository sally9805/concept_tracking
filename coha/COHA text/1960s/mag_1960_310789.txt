West Indies-born Hulan Edwin Jack was brought to New York City as a youngster by his father , a minister of the African Orthodox Church . Hulan pushed a broom at the Peerless Paper Box Co. , Inc. , pushed right on up to become one of the firm 's vice presidents . He applied equal energy to Democratic politics in Harlem , where , as a faithful Tammany Hall wheel horse , he won seven elections to the state assembly . Jack 's jackpot came in 1953 when Tammany , forewarned of Republican plans to nominate a Negro for borough president of Manhattan , dumped two white hopefuls , gave Jack the nod . Elected and re-elected four years later , Hulan Jack stood as one of the nation 's highest-ranking Negro officeholders-until last week , when he suspended himself after being indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice and three violations of the city charter . <P> Embarrassing Question . Jack 's troubles began last month when New York Post reporters , following up a tip , asked him an embarrassing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his six-room Harlem apartment ? Cried Jack : " I have n't a damn thing to say about it , and you get the hell out of here . " But a week later Jack admitted that Real Estate Operator Sidney J. Ungar , a longtime pal and Tammany Democrat , had picked up the $4,400 tab . It was not a gift . Jack insisted , merely a friendly loan without note or collateral . But it just so happened that while Ungar was paying to have Jack 's bedroom painted orchid pink , he was also seeking city approval of a $30 million slum clearance project-and Hulan Jack , as borough president , held the right of veto . Ungar 's project got the green light until early last year , when newspapers identified would-be Slum Clearer Ungar as the owner of some of New York 's worst slum housing ; later he was denied project sponsorship , and Hulan Jack himself voted against his friend . <P> " Panicky " Reply . New York District Attorney Frank S. Hogan pressed the indictments against Jack under sections of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking or performing city business . Hogan also said that Jack , when first questioned officially about the apartment remodeling , had " concocted " a story that his wife , Almira , had paid Contractor-Painter Fred Bechtel out of her $100 weekly household allowance . " Prior to telling me this , " Hogan said , " Mr. Jack had told Mr. Ungar that if he told me Mrs. Jack had made the payments . . . the investigation would be over because I would have so much confidence in what he said . " <P> But Hogan had no such confidence in Hulan Jack 's word ; he took his case against Jack to the grand jury that same day . Next day Jack , shaken , was back in Hogan 's office with the admission that he had gotten " panicky " and had lied . Subsequent testimony before the grand jury brought the four-count indictment , listing Ungar ( who had testified under a privilege of immunity ) as " coconspirator " but not as codefendant.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
