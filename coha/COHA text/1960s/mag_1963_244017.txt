August in Brazil , by tradition and local superstition , is a miserable month . It was August when President Getlio Vargas shot himself in 1954 , and when President Janio Quadros put out to sea in a fit of pea-green pique in 1961 . Blaming Brazil 's ills on the calendar is like blaming winter on the woolly bear ; but last week , as Brazilians watched their potentially prosperous country sink deeper into economic and political con fusion , it must have been August 's fault . It could hardly be President Joao Goulart 's ; he had n't done anything . <P> Noisy Mute . In July Brazilians were told that the cost of living had spiraled upward a dizzying 70% in a year . It now takes 850 cruzeiros to buy a dollar ( up from 500 a year ago ) . Eight major unions threatened strikes unless they got raises ranging from 40% to 90% , and dairies vowed to turn off the milk if they were not allowed a 50% price increase . Most troublesome of all , the army wanted more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of itself as the " great mute , " strong in power , silent in politics . Unlike many Latin American armed forces , it has yet to foist a military dictatorship on the country . In a century and a half , it has overthrown a Portuguese king , two Brazilian emperors , a president , a dictator , and even a would-be military strongman . But every coup , the brass likes to boast , was a direct translation of the popular will . True to tradition , the army today is an all-too-faithful reflection of the nation-divided , discontented and quarrelsome . <P> Rattled Noncoms . Last month the austere ballroom of Rio de Janeiro 's Military Club shook with saber-rattling debate as officers protested the chaos and inflation around them and issued a two-week ultimatum for a 100% pay increase . Unless they got higher pay , shouted one officer , " it will not be the fall of the Bastille , but of Brasilia . " Such talk annoyed the noncommissioned officers , a more left-wing bunch , who tend to consider Goulart something of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accusations that the generals wanted to overthrow the President . A pair of oratorical army sergeants were put in jail for tirades against the officers . When a marine sergeant was arrested for similar talk , 100 of his comrades , protesting his arrest , had to be marched off to the stockade . <P> The government 's response was characteristic Goulart . For talking against the government , the army marshal who is president of the officers ' club was arrested , along with other outspoken officers . But then everybody got a raise . Congress shouted through an average 80% pay increase for all federal employees , including the armed forces . President Goulart , who had solemnly promised President Kennedy a period of austerity in return for a $398.5 million dollar loan commitment , signed the big pay raise . Before the month is out , printing presses will have to roll off about 50 billion new cruzeiros to add to the 54 billion already printed this year . That 's August in Brazil .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
