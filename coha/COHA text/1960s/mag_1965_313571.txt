The forecaster at the San Francisco airport was busily recording weather data from ships and planes out in the Pacific . And as the hieroglyphics of his profession spread across his maps , he recognized signs of trouble . The Pacific High , a mass of high-pressure air that normally occupies most of the area between Alaska and Hawaii , shielding California in winter from rain-bearing oceanic winds , was breaking in two before his eyes . Half of it had moved southward to the latitude of Mexico while the other half had shifted north ward to the Gulf of Alaska . Through the low-pressure gap that resulted , a stream of warm , moist , tropical air , 500 miles wide and dotted with storms , was flowing toward Northern California . <P> The forecaster wasted no time issuing a warning , and trouble came right on schedule . For ten days last month a wind from Hawaii blew across the Northern California coast , dropping its moisture when forced to climb over the mountains . Heavy rain fell , in some places 35 inches . Eastward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst drenching ; the warm rain melted accumulated snow , adding another ten inches to the foaming runoff . Before the ill wind from Hawaii stopped blowing , it had started disastrous floods that cost nearly 50 lives and almost a billion dollars in damage . <P> Canadian High . While the Pacific Northwest was suffering , the rest of the U.S. was enjoying unusually calm and warm winter weather . The Canadian High , another meteorological fixture , moved southward to cover the central part of the continent , protecting it from arctic cold and keeping the bad weather of the Pacific from penetrating much beyond the Rocky Mountains . <P> After ten days , the Pacific High pulled itself together again . The normal pattern of northwest winter weather brought cold air from Alaska . Snowfall put ski resorts back in business again . The steep rivers stopped foaming , and river towns began cleaning up the debris left by floods . Then , early last week , the sheltering Pacific High broke in two once more , and another wind from Hawaii headed for California . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the hills . <P> Warm Water or Jet Stream . But by week 's end the Pacific High was knitting itself together again and West Coast weathermen were trying to spot the original cause of the trouble . Some of them blamed the jet stream , the belt of high-altitude wind that blows around the planet in mid-latitudes . It has been unusually swift this winter , reaching speeds of 150 m.p.h. , and has crossed the U.S. in an unusual pattern , curving down from western Alaska to Southern California and then slanting up to Chicago . It may have had some influence on low-altitude weather , but experts do not agree . One group blames the West Coast 's time of weather trouble on a great patch of unusually warm surface water far out in the Pacific , which may have somehow encouraged the Hawaiian wind . Most meteorologists ruefully admit that they can not spot the ultimate cause of the trouble with any assurance .
