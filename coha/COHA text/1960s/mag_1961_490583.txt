Notes and Comment WE received a wistful letter not long ago from a customer of the New York Telephone Company . He tells us that on moving to a new apartment , in the neighborhood of Gramercy Park , he was issued a telephone with the exchange " LF 3 . " He called the company to End out what the letters stand for , and learned that they do n't stand for anything  --  that they are just letters . He was further informed that in time all exchanges will be arranged in this fashion , " to facilitate intercity dialling . " This is painful news to us , for we have long entertained a deep , and conceivably perverse , affection for the words of the directory . Poets have celebrated the wit and sonority of the names of American towns , but to our way of thinking they are not a patch on the telephone exchanges of New York . We linger over the rippling liquefaction of " SUsquehanna , " the sturdiness of " MOnument , " the liveliness of " SPring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sweet " LOrraine . " These are names to dial and conjure with . And what of our rich legacy from an OLder Civilization  --  stirring names like " TRafalgar , " " OXford , " " VHitchall , " " CHelsea , " and " REgent " i Is this great tradition to be curtailed on behalf of intercity dialling ? We hope not . To be sure , we can see that the company might have trouble finding names for some of the new exchanges . " XT 5 , " for instance , would not lend itself readily to wordmaking . But surely no one would begrudge the company a little poetic license in this crises . Why not " XTasy 5 " ? Other letters that will eventually be left wordless will prove easier to accommodate . A simple addition converting " WO 2 " to " W0e 2 " would give the exchange a fine Old Testament ring .

" And " LF 3 , " our correspondent 's exchange , has us stumped . Perhaps one of the Central European countries , where words like " chat " and names like " Pfemysl " are found in consonantal abundance , would offer a useful clue to investigators . Or , if all else fails , the company could abandon " LF " without altering its equipment , merely by selecting other letters from the same holes in the dial . To oblige our correspondent and their unhappy customer , they might , at the very least , issue him a " jEremiad . " Viva Vivaldi ! OF the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after innumerable fearful setbacks the exhausted hero finally achieves victory , and the sort in which all the nice round golden apples fall into the hero 's lap the moment he nudges the tree  --  we confess to a sneaking fondness for the latter . It 's a particular pleasure , therefore , to tell you about Max Goberman , conductor of the New York Sinfonietta , who had a splendid notion , decided to act on it , encountered no hardships in turning the notion into reality , and met with immediate acclaim for having done so . The formal name of Mr. Goherman 's notion is the Library of Recorded Masterpieces , and it had its genesis in the fall of 1957 , when Mr. G. was conducting the orchestra for " West Side Story . " Between performances , he would stop in at various record stores around town and listen to recordings , and as he did so he found himself silently reproaching the big record companies on several grounds , among them that they recorded relatively few of the enormous number of works by the accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too frequently , that they let these recordings go out of print too rapidly , and that in most cases the scores they chose to record had been corrupted by generations of gratuitous " interpretation " ? a practice that was positively scandalous in the light of the extremely high standards of contemporary musical scholarship . What Mr. Goberman dreamed of producing was a library of recordings of compositions that had previously gone unrecorded , or had been incorrectly recorded , or were out of print  --  recordings that would he based on authentic scores and that would he accompanied by printed facsimiles of these scores . It was an ambitious program , and presumably would not be easy to launch without a gond deal of business experience , of which our hero had none whatever . " I 'd never raised a nickel of capital for anything in my life , " he told us when we visited him in the cluttered little office of the Library of Recorded Masterpieces , on West Eighty-second Street . " Not knowing what else to do , I simply started talking to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more than I needed . To begin with , I decided it would be fun to record all of somebody 's works , and at once Vivaldi came to mind . He turned out approximately six hundred instrumental pieces , which the firm of G. Ricordi , in Milan , is currently engaged in publishing . Ricordi agreed to let us send out facsimiles , reduced in size , of the scores they 'd published . For our first record , I rehearsed the Sinfonietta twice , then announced a pre-recording dress rehearsal , before an audience , in the Carnegie Recital Hall . To my astonishment , we sold out , with a ticket line that ran along Fifty-seventh Street and around onto Seventh Avenue . A day or so later , we repeated the concert , this time in Carnegie Hall itself , and practically sold out . We 've handled all our later recording sessions in the same way . Each time , I figure we 'll be playing to half a house , but we never are . For some reason , Vivaldi is in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a small , unknown maker would be overlooked in the record stores , Mr. G. has marketed his product entirely by subscription . The Library uses direct-mail and magazine advertising to reach potential subscribers , and the response has been , in a word , staggering . " Our subscribers range from the Sterling Memorial Library , at Yale , to a man in Djakarta , " Mr. G. said . " After we 'd made our first half-dozen records , I began to wonder whether our subscribers would n't rebel at an unbroken run of several hundred Vivaldis , so I went over to Vienna last summer and  --  working with H. C. Robbins Landon , the preeminent Haydn authority taped performances , by the orchestra of the Vienna State Opera , of Lan-don 's authenticated scores of seventeen Haydn symphonies . Forgood measure , I then taped Corelli 's total orchestral output , which will fit exactly onto twelve records , as if old Corelli had written it all with L.P.s in mind .

" Parting THE following message was written on a piece of notebook paper , decorated with sparkles and knitting yarn , that was Found in one of the size 3 shoes attached to a pair of ice skates at a recent rummage sale held for the benefit of a suburban P.-T . A. : Slave Market TO most of us , the annual three-day meetings of the American Historical Association would appear to be occasions for the reading of scholarly papers and the exchange of academic shoptalk , but to the three thousand-odd teachers of history who make up the hulk of the Association 's membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market , where  --  by a process so roundabout and seemingly offhand that it can best he described as a form of extrasensory perception  --  the majority of the more attractive vacancies in the profession are filled . When we looked in on the latest meeting of the Association , held a week or so ago at the Statler Hilton , a professor of history whom we happen to know volunteered to sketch for us the crude outlines of the system . " No intelligent young historian would ever approach anybody directly about a job , " he told us . " If he did , he 'd automatically , he finished . The way it works is this : You get the professor who nursed you through your Ph.D . to sponsor you at one of these meetings ; that is , you prompt him to discuss with some friend of his who teaches at the college in which you 're most interested the general subject of possible vacancies on the history faculty there . Of course , your sponsor and his friend do n't actually talk about a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chinese marriage brokers , they keep skirting the subject proper , and it may be a couple of days before you learn whether there 's a place open and then whether it will be offered to you . I 've heard of cases where an understanding was reached without a single mention of either the job or the candidate for the job . This kind of thing occasionally leads to misunderstandings ; a professor may find himself placing a man at a salary the man wo n't accept , simply because the matter of money has been thought too sordid to bring up . " The commonest sight at annual meetings of the Association , our friend said , is a man in his sixties moving casually about among his peers and followed , at a little distance , by a nervous man of thirty or so . The older man is a professor and the younger is his favorite graduate student , for whom he 's trying to land a suitable position . " I heard a moment ago what happened this morning to a leading historian here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maneuver a meeting between his candidate and an influential colleague . When he turned around to summon the candidate for a formal introduction , the young man was nowhere to be found . After a frantic search , the historian came upon him at one of the regularly scheduled sessions , where he was listening with rapt attention to a lecture on urbanism . A man of action , the historian dragged the poor fellow nut of the room by his coat collar , roaring , ' Do n't let me ever catch you listening to a paper when I 'm trying to find you a job ! ' " Our learned friend thereupon pro-ceeded to divide American historians in-to three main groups . First , there is the n , " or " white-haired , " or " shoe " group , which can be defined as comprising the men who attend the smokers given by such publishers as the Co-lumbia University Press , the University of Chicago Press , Macmillan , and Knopf , and who feel at home at them . ( No invitation lists for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mem-bers of the " in " group prac-tically never attend , because none of the " in " s will talk to them if they do . ) " This top group consists of possibly two hundred men , " said our friend . " It produces most of the Pulitzer Prize winners fur history , most of the officials of the American Historical Association , most of the full professors of history in the leading universities , and most of the highest administrators in foundation work and in the government . The thing they all have in common is that they publish a great deal . The second group , which embraces the overwhelming majority of American historians , consists of excellent teachers who for some reason just are n't eligible for the in ' group . Maybe they did n't attend the right universities , or maybe they lacked the proper sponsorship , or maybe they have n't published enough . The third group is made up of historians who have acquired rank by the simple attrition of their colleagues , of people who staff teachers ' colleges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the profession , teachers ' colleges arc put in the lowest bracket . MCMht:rs of their faculties have the heaviest teaching loads and the lowest salaries , and , to tell the truth , the least inspiring students . " At annual meetings of the A.H.A. , members of the " in " group give most if the speeches , while the " out " groups sit and listen . Members of the " in " group who do n't happen to be giving speeches rarely bother to listen to their colleagues ; they prefer to stand around and talk and carry on their secret bargaining . Our friend estimated that as many as two hundred and fifty jobs change hands in the course of a meeting . " Few changes are considered final on the spot , " he said . " Usually , a candidate will want to go home and talk it over with his wife . Historians are in great demand , for once , thanks to all the war babies who are coming along and demanding a college education . American and European History @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are real shortages in Ancient and Medieval , not to mention Asian . A sellers ' market , thank God ! " Having agreed to look up a colleague who claimed to have a most promising young Modern European man in tow , our friend passed us along to Professor Oscar Hand/in , of Harvard , who said that the standard advice given to young historians at that institution is : Do n't ask for a job , wait to be asked . " We always place our students well , usually through personal contacts , " he said . " I 've been attending these meetings for twenty-five years , and I figure I know about two thousand people in the profession , man of whom I 'll be seeing here . Student placement becomes cumulative after a while ; your former students become chairmen of departments and appeal to you when they 've jobs to he filled . Some of my students are being looked over right now . The system is n't very efficient , but the qualities we 're after arc , of necessity , vague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will go on an card . " After securing from Professor Handha a rough estimate of where most of our leading historians come from  --  thirty per cent from Harvard , twenty per cent from Yale , Columbia , Wisconsin , and the University of California at Berkeley , and the rest from all over -- we stopped off for a word with Professor Dean Alhertson , of Brooklyn College , who was in charge of something known as the Job Register . " Though nearly all of the hiring is done on an informal basis , the Register is intended to act as an employment agency , " he said . " It 's been going for years , but up to now it has n't worked as well as we had hoped . This year , we 're trying something revolutionary . We 've put a big white sign in the lobby , where everyone can see it , which for the first time will make many of the available jobs public knowledge , instead of closely guarded secrets . This year , also for the first time , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in the past , only the smaller colleges were willing to . On the Register are the names of nearly four hundred historians who want jobs and a total of ninety-three jobs . The discrepancy is n't as great as it seems ; a lot of the registrants already have good jobs and are simply looking around for something better . " To complete our education in the ways of the A.H.A. , Professor Albertson gave us a brief lecture on employ ment semantics . " One must learn to read references and letters of recommendation with care , " he said . " For instance , if a man is described as ' adequate ' he 's as good as dead . I 'd also have my doubts about well-grounded . ' And the term distinguished scholar , ' if used about a man fifty-five years old and a full professor , is apt to carry precisely the opposite connotation . " We learned that a sentence like " He 's had a little difficulty shaping his thesis , but he 's a very good teacher " should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for life , because he wo n't publish , " and that " Congenial , eager to please , responsive to suggestion , and adored by his students " translates into " Intellectually , a bust . " As for " His book is bound to make a real contribution in its field , " this must he read as implying , " Nobody outside the field can possibly get through it . " Life is hard , even in Academe . ? INCIDENTAL DENTAL INTELLIGENCE : Switzerland now puts out an American-type fluoride toothpaste called D rah . Thai Prince WE dropped in on the Metropolitan Muse urn of Art 's current " Art Treas-ures of Thailand " exhibition about a week ago , while it was being set up , and had a chat with its installateur , Prince Suhhadradis Diskul , chief cu-rator of the National Mu-seum of Bangkok , from which most of the show 's three hundred treasures were obtained . " The exhibit was first shown at Indiana University , " said the Prince , a scholarly-looking black-haired , gray-flannel-trouscred man of thirty-seven . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closes in New York , in late February , it will travel to Bos-ton , Toledo , Los Angeles , Seattle , San Francisco , and Honolulu . It 's the first time our museum has ever sent such a large show out of the country  --  or , for that matter , out of the museum . " He went on to say that his institution is housed in the old Palace of the Prince Successor , and that most of its contents , once the private collection of the King , were put on public view in 1926 by his own father , Prince Damrong , an archeologist and historian . " He was a half brother of King Chulalongkurn , or Rama the Fifth , " Prince Diskul said , " and a sun of King Mungkiit , or Rama the Fourth , the King of ' Anna and the King of Siam ' and ' The King and I , ' who was so unfortunately misrepresented both in the two films and on the stage . My grandfather never burned anyone alive , as the films stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly twenty years in a monastery before ascending the throne , in 1851 ; he was a serious ruler who Westernized our country ; he never fell in love with Mrs. Anna Leonowens , the English governess he imported for his children ; and , contrary to Rodgers and Hammerstein , she left Siam before he died and was succeeded by his son . The movie version of ' The King and I ' was forbidden in Bangkok , but I saw it in Tokyo . " Turning to less controversial matters , the Prince directed our attention to a number of stone Buddhas dating from the sixth century ; various animal and human figures in stucco and terra cotta ; seventy or eighty bronze images , pedestals , utensils , and su on ; and a great variety of jewelry , ceramics , wooden sculpture , paintings , silks , and illuminated manuscripts . " Maternity dolls , " he said of three tiny ceramic figures , all of which had been decapitated . " They were given to pregnant women who were thought to be threatened by spirits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demons . " we said . " If an evil spirit sees that a mother is dead , he does n't bother the mother or the child , " the Prince said . " Look at this lacquered hook cabinet , decorated with a tree bearing women . Observe the hermits who are plucking the women from the boughs in order to consume them . That 's because the women were thought to wither after a week , and the hermits wanted to get them while they were fresh . " He advised us that this astonishing object came , astonishing/y , from a monastery , and that he himself came from Bangkok , where he graduated front Chulakingkorn University ( named after his uncle t and presently , after five years of art studies in Paris and London , joined the National Museum , which is run by his government 's Department of Fine Arts . " We do n't have enough room to show our material , " he said , striking a curatorial note familiar to us . " We charge a fee on weekdays and are npen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors around , and I will conduct guided tours here at the Metropolitan . I 'm also giving some lectures here and at Asia House . " We asked Prince Diskul whether he has any brothers and sisters , and he said yes , suite a few . " Polygamy prevailed in my father 's day , " he went on . " He was sixty-one when I was horn , and I was brought up by my aunt , Princess Ahhantri , in her palace . Our present King  --  Bhumibel , or Rama the Ninth  --  is ; 3 cousin of mine in various ways . I do n't share his enthusiasm for jazz . " The Prince , who is staying at the Hotel Winslow , has one wife , and one infant daughter , in Bangkok . His present visit is his second ; he spent four months here in 1957 , at the invitation of the State Department , inspecting Oriental art in American cities . " I 'm very fond of Chinatown and of your opera , " he said . " Its singing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even hotter . I 've just seen ' My Fair Lady ; ' I could n't get in when I was here before . I met Yul Bry nner in Hollywood that time  --  he was making The Buccaneer ' ? and I also met Cecil B. deMille . I suggested a film on Angkor Wat to him , and he said , ' It 's a date . I 'll meet you there , ' but then he died . " We asked the Prince whether he had taken issue with Yu ' Brynner on " The King and I , " and he said , " It was too late . He 'd finished with it . " " Ant chance of your hecoming King ? " we asked as we left . " None , " he said , with a jolly laugh . " I 'd have to kill hundreds of people first .
