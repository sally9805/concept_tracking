" Mayor-Whelan , Who is In Washington , and Mr. Kenny could not be reached for comment yesterday . However , their lawyer , Peter Campbell Brown , a former New York City Corporation Counsel , filed a motion to dismiss the suit on the ground that the state court here could not interfere " with the internal acts of governmental bodies ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 22 on the dismissal motion . The suit disclosed that a Hudson County Grand Jury was considering " certain aspects of this matter , " as well as other evidence involving any possible wrongdoing in the Holland Tunnel Project area .
