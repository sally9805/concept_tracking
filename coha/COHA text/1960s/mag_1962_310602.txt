Do filter tips really work ? Yes , reported an eminent cancer researcher in last week 's A.M.A. Journal . They make smoking safer-up to a point . <P> Dr. George E. Moore 's research team at Buffalo 's Roswell Park Memorial Institute tested six brands of cigarettes , four plain and two filtered , by " smoking " them in a machine and collecting the tar . <P> The tar yields from plain cigarettes differed by less than 20% , but the filtered brands yielded 67% less than the unfiltered average . Of 76 mice painted with tar from " straights , " 41 developed tumors , and 16 of these turned to cancer ; of 60 mice treated with the tar from the same number of filter tips , 15 got tumors , of which three became cancerous . <P> The evidence that filters reduce the risk of lung cancer is " indirect but meaningful , " say Dr. Moore and colleagues . <P> Among smokers , men who smoke fewer cigarettes have a lower incidence of cancer ; so , presumably , will those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tar they draw into their lungs .
