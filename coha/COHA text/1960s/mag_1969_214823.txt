TAX increases in Britain are imposed with guillotine-like dispatch . Disclosing few , if any , details in advance , the government presents the bad news in its annual budget and gets quick approval from a compliant Parliament . In what has become a national guessing game , Britons start hedge-buying weeks beforehand on goods and services that they expect to be hit by new taxes . They are urged on by shop-window posters that read " Beat the Budget . " Because of Britain 's economic difficulties , the guessing in recent years has been over where-not whether-the tax ax would fall . <P> Thus , few Britons were surprised when on Budget Day last week Chancellor of the Exchequer Roy Jenkins announced higher taxes and other austerity measures . This time , politics impelled Jenkins to go light on wage earners and to hit business heavily . Still , his prescription calls for much the same medicine that has so far proved ineffectual in curing Britain 's ailing economy . Somewhat lamely , Jenkins told the House of Commons that the long-promised economic recovery " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Britain 's economy is considerably weaker than Jenkins admitted . Technically bankrupt , with foreign debts that greatly exceed its reserves of gold and foreign currencies , the country depends on international loans to support the pound . Sterling 's devaluation 17 months ago was supposed to give Britain time to overcome its chronic trade deficit , the main source of its precarious financial condition . Instead , the country wound up with a 1968 trade deficit of $1.1 billion , and the red ink has continued to flow this year . Last week the Board of Trade reported a March trade deficit of $124.8 million , a disappointingly small improvement over the $ 153.6 million deficit of the month before . <P> Dallying Over Demand . Efforts to improve the trade picture have been bungled repeatedly by Harold Wilson 's Labor government . After devaluation , Wilson dallied for months over steps to curb domestic demand , which was not only stoking inflation but sucking in imports that Britain could ill afford . The government belatedly imposed a record $2.3 billion of new taxes a year ago and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All such restrictions reckoned without the canny determination of the British consumer , who ran up his personal debt and ran down his personal savings to get rid of his money before rising prices and taxes further reduced its value . Consumer spending , instead of declining 1.9% last year as the government had intended , rose by 1.2% . Wages also rose by 7% last year and prices by 6% , despite government efforts to control both . The government undermined its own wage-restraint policies by agreeing to a big raise for workers on the government-owned railways .
