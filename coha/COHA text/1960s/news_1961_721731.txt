txt The Senate passed an emergency feed-grains bill today by partisan vote of 52 to 26 . The measure . is based on proposals by the Administration , but differs sharply in detail . , It also differs from a bill passed in the House yesterday . Both measures , however , are designed to control a feedgrain surplus and to increase farm . income by reducing production and raising price supports . The biggest difference is that the Senate bill drops a House provision designed to force fanners to join the acreage reduction program . Nominal Rises Seen Secretary of Agriculture Orville L. Freeman moved on another front to raise farm income , perhaps by as much as $2,000,000,000 this year . He announced increases in price supports for dairy products , rice and peanuts , and the maintenance of the 1960 support level for naval stores . Mr. Freeman said it was " difficult'to calculate what , if any , effect there would be on consumer prices " as a ; pia of his actions .. Any increase , he asserted : should be " extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the dealer price of milk probably would go up about one-half of 1 cent a gallon . But he would not estimate what this would mean in terms of the bottle price of household milk . Support Levels Listed The support levels Mr. Freeman announced today were : ( Dairy products ? $3.40 a hundredweight for Manufacturing milk used in making processed dairy products . This was an increase of 18 cents . The new level was put into effect immediately and through the marketing ' year ending March 31 , 1962 . ( Mutter fat ? 60.4 cents a pound , an increase from 59.6 cents . The new support is effective for the same time as the manufacturing milk support . gRice ? $4.71 a hundredweight for the 1961 crop , compared with $4.42 a hundredweight last year . ( peanuts ? ; 221 a ton for the 1961 crop , compared with $201.24 for the 1960 crop . In addition , Mr. Freeman discontinued a $9-a-ton deduction from the support price that has been made for inspection , storage and other charges . ? ( Gum naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as in 1960 . The Administration has argued that its feed-grains program , too , will cause only slight consumer price increases . This argument apparently convinced urban Democrats . Many Of them were among the fortyone members of . their party voting today for the . Senate WI They were joined by eleven Republicans , mostly from-farm states . Opposing the measure were . eight Democrati , and eighteen ' Republicans . The Senate action meant that a conference would have to be held with the House to iron out differences in the conflicting bills . Under the Senate version the controversial Section 3 , of the House bill has been dropped . This is a grant of power to the Secretary of Agriculture to sell Government-owned grains at any price not less than 17 per cent below the support price . It designed to force grain . growera to enter the acreage reduction program . The Senate bill would require growers who wished to be eligible for price supports on corn and grain sorghums to reduce their acreage planted to these grains by 30 per cent . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn and to equivalent levels for other grains . Growers would be compensated in cash for half the value of the crop they could have grown on half the retired acres . They would be compensated in kind , from Government stocks , for 60 per cent of the value of the crop they could have grown on the other half of the idle land . This differs from the Administration 's proposals and from the House bill . The latter measure would require a 20 per cent acreage cut for price support eligibility , and would compensate growers in cash for half the value of the crop that could have been grown . A Further , Reduction It would permit a further 20 per cent reduction , and would compensate growers in kind for 60 per cent of the crop that could have been grown . The House bill 's Section 3 would permit the Secretary of Agriculture to depress the market price of grain by selling Government stocks down ' to about $1 a bushel for corn . This would keep growers who did not make the acreage cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . Complying farmers would be protected by the price support . Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois , a Republican who deplored in debate but voted for the bill , elicited from Senator Allen J. Ellender of Louisiana a pledge that he would not accept Section 3 in a final version of the bill . ' Senator-Ellender is the Democratic chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee and the head of the Senate conferees . They will meet with House conferees next week . Other sources said the Democratic and Administration strategy still was to insert some form of . Section 3 in the final bill . Their view is that . corn growers ' will not make the acreage cuts in sufficient numbers unless this weapon is provided to the Secretary of Agriculture . The debate lasted several hours today but was seldom heated . Few Senators were on the floor before the roll-call and only two amendments , both minor , were accepted by the measure 's Democratic managers .                    @
