Most professional golfers can not take the tension of watching their competitors hole out in the final stages of a big tournament . They sweat it out in the clubhouse locker room . But as husky Joyce Ziske clumped confidently onto the 18th green at the Worcester , Mass . Country Club last week needing only a 5-ft. putt to tie the U.S. Women 's Open , a nervous , long-legged blonde moved to the edge of the crowd and prayed silently : " Miss it ! Please miss it ! " <P> Coolly , Joyce addressed the ball , tapped it toward the cup-and saw it run wide . A quick grin burst across the blonde 's broad face . " Oh , boy , " she sighed , " that was agony ! " By the slim margin of a single stroke-the dinky putt that Joyce Ziske missed-beaming , Carolina-born Betsy Rawls , 32 , had won her fourth U.S. Women 's Open , adding 1960 to her victories in 1951 , 1953 and 1957 . No woman golfer , not even the incomparable Babe Didrikson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory , worth $1,800 was sweet for Betsy . An erratic player who , at her scrambling best , is the most exciting female golfer in the world , she was last year 's leading money winner ( with a record $26,760 ) on the women 's tour , has been a topflight pro ever since she graduated with Phi Beta Kappa honors from the University of Texas in 1950 . Taut and moody on the golf course , Betsy lugs a portable phonograph with her on the tour , relaxes between rounds with Wagnerian opera . This season , Betsy had been in a frustrating slump , had won only two major tournaments prior to the Open , and had watched her earnings drop to $9,421 . <P> In the Open , though , she was superb . <P> In sixth place after two days and trailing by seven strokes at the start of the grueling , 36-hole final round , Betsy played the hilly , 6,137-yd course as if she owned it . Betsy curled in long , difficult putts-one of 60 ft. - with grooved accuracy , gained six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finished the morning 18 with a 4-under-par 68 , tying the tournament record . She wilted a bit in the afternoon sun and slipped to a 75 . It was just enough to win when 25-year-old Joyce Ziske 's challenge failed on the final hole . Champion Rawls 's 72-hole total : a 4-over-par 292 strokes-the exact score Old Pro Betsy , three days before , had predicted would win . <P> <P> * Mrs. Zaharias ' record : 1948 , 1950 and 1954.
