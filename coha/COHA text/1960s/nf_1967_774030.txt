txt z zo Textbook of Economic Analysis this optimum will involve different proportional combinations of the various factors for different types of commodity ; some commodities are produced most cheaply with a lot of land and relatively little labour and capital , while others are best produced with large amounts of capital but relatively little land and labour . The optimum combination for any given commodity will also vary from time to time as new techniques and inventions occur . Changes of both of these will involve shifts in the position or slope of the isoquants . Finally , the optimum is closely related to the relative costs of the various factors ; one combination may be the optimum for a particular commodity when land is relatively plentiful , and therefore cheap , but a completely different combination may become the optimum if land becomes dearer relative to labour ; such a change can be analysed by an appropriate adjustment of the slope of the price line . 3 . LARGE-SCALE OUTPUT-INCREASING RETURNS The law of diminishing returns ? output per unit of resources decreasing as the scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Output per unit of resources employed is the obverse of average cost per unit of output . If on a farm 500 units of produce result in a year when ten men are employed , it can either be said that average output per man is 5o units a year or that the average cost of a unit of produce is u of a man-year . The two things are the same . Hence the law of diminishing returns can be expressed in the form : after a certain point , the application of further factors of production to another factor which is fixed in supply will result in rising average costs of production . As was stressed earlier , this characteristic of productive activity is in no sense confined to agriculture . At any moment of time , an industrial entrepreneur will find that after a certain level of production has been reached the application of further units of labour to his fixed stock of capital will bring in diminishing returns , and the same would happen in the much rarer case in which , at any point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts of capital . This feature of productive activity generally is reflected in the shape of the isoquants in Fig . Ig ; departure from the single Enterprise I2I optimum combination of factors for any level of output results in increased costs , or ? to put the same thing in another way ? in lower output per unit of resources employed . The law of diminishing returns was specifically formulated , however , in terms of a situation in which the state of knowledge and technological possibilities generally remained unchanged . Now it is a feature of industry generally that an increase in the scale of output often does not leave technological possibilities unchanged : methods and techniques become practicable which were not open to the entrepreneur so long as output was maintained at a lower level , with the result that average returns to the factors employed will increase . In terms of the previous analysis , this means that the isoquants become closer and closer together as the entrepreneur 's total outlay on factors of production increases . In contrast to the situation of diminishing returns as increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a fixed amount of another factor or group of factors , then , industrial expansion is frequently associated with increasing returns because it enables entrepreneurs to take advantage of the economies of large-scale production . What are these economies which are reaped by a producer as his scale of output increases ? Theee best classified under the two headings internal and external . Internal economies are those which result from the expansion of an individual firm and are enjoyed only by that firm ; they may be technical , marketing or financial in nature . By technical economies are meant reductions in the cost of the manufacturing process itself . Increased division of labour is a major source of economies under this heading ; with a small output it may not be possible to employ one man wholly on one process or part of a process , but , as output rises and the labour force grows , a greater degree of specialisation , with all its advantages , may become possible : This may apply to management as well as operatives ; the small firm may have only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management from labour relations to sales promotion , but a big firm may be able to employ specialists in these activities . A second possibility is the increased use of machinery ; a high-speed drilling machine , for example , would be largely idle in a firm whose weekly output could be handled by it in an hour , and it would // therefore be uneconomic ; its possibilities might be fully exploited , however , in a bigger firm . Not only will the use of machinery be more widespread in a large rather than a small firm ; frequently , equipment is cheaper to construct and operate ( per unit of output ) as its size increases . Doubling the area of the sides of a furnace , for example , will result in considerably more than a doubling of its capacity . A large lorry needs no more drivers than a small one , and so on . Further , a large plant may be able to take advantage of the linking of processes ? that is , to arrange production in such a way that the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wastes involved in breaking production up into separate stages . A large steel mill , for example , may be able to convert ore into pigiron , iron into crude steel and crude steel into finished steel strip without any break in the sequence , so reducing the transport costs and costs of heating and re-heating incurred if the process were carried on in its separate stages by smaller plants . The marketing economies may be of buying or selling . On the buying side , gains will arise if the orders for raw materials are large enough to justify the employment of a skilled buyer . Buying in large quantities is in any case cheaper than in small lots , since the costs of handling and transport rarely increase in the same proportion as the quantities purchased ; further , sellers frequently offer more favourable terms to important customers placing large orders . Selling , also , is generally less expensive per unit in the case of large quantities , since a selling organisation of a given size is often necessary whatever the volume of sales handled . Commercial travellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and effort as that involved in securing a small order ; the costs of bookkeeping and administration are frequently the same for a large as for a small sale . A high turnover of goods may justify speciallydesigned transport facilities or sales outlets which handle the selling process with maximum efficiency and effectiveness . The financial economies are fairly obvious . A big firm is usually regarded by investors as less risky than a small one , so that they are often willing to lend capital to it at a lower price . Banks are less likely to refuse accommodation to a large concern in times of credit stringency ; important customers are too valuable to be lightly refused help . The costs of raising funds on the capital market do not // increase proportionately with the size of the sum borrowed , so that the average cost of borrowing in this way is smaller for a large-scale borrower . All these economies accrue to an individual firm as it grows , and are known as internal economies . By external economies are meant the gains arising from the growth-of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , irrespective of their size . When an industry becomes big enough , for example , disintegration may occur ? that is , one process may be split off and performed on a large scale by a specialist firm which can gain all the economies of large-scale operation in that particular process . All firms in the industry will now be able to have this process carried out for them at a low cost instead of attempting to meet their own needs by carrying it out themselves on a small scale and at high cost . The subsidiary trades referred to in Chapter 6 may spring up when the industry has become big enough to support them , and all firms will benefit from this . Specialist buying and selling agencies may be established ; waste-products on a sufficient scale may justify the formation of firms utilising them , so reducing total costs ; research and information bureaux may supply services for an industry which no individual firm could afford to provide from its own resources . Frequently such economies are associated with the specialisation of a given area in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily take this form . All these economies , internal and external , in a sense arise from the fact that some of the factors of production are indivisible ? they are available only in lumps , so to speak : P. labour were completely divisible into small units , the optimum Tivision of labour could be adopted however small the labour force , a fractional amount of labour being employed on each separate process . In fact , however , one man ( or woman ) is the smallest unit of labour which exists , and a man may therefore have to be employed on several processes so long as the scale of output is too small to justify his specialisation on one . Similarly , all the technical economies arising from the increased use of machinery are denied the small-scale producer because he can not install a fraction of a machine ; he can use the machinery only when his output is big enough to keep at least one machine in fairly full employment . The full benefits of technolo124 Textbook of Economic Analysis gical development and inventions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are large enough to take proper advantage of them . 4 . SMALL-SCALE OUTPUT In view of the fact that large-scale industrial production often results in important economies which reduce average costs of production , how is it that small-scale enterprises survive ? That they do survive is shown by the fact that in 1961 about 140,000 of the 200,000 or so establishments operating in manufacturing trades in the United Kingdom employed less than 11 people ( although they provided rather less than 10 per cent of the total employment in manufacturing ) . Many of these establishments may have been jointly owned by a single firm , of course , but it is obvious that even so small firms are by no means extinct in British industry . Several factors underlie this stubborn survival of small-scale enterprise . The most important is probably the limitation of the size of the markets ; there is no point in producing on a large scale if only a small proportion of the output can be disposed of in the market . Many markets are severely limited by transport considerations ? people like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always be transported very far , garages and laundries and hotels have to be established in the areas where they are needed . Milk-processing costs might be reduced to a minimum if all the milk in the country was handled by one central establishment , but for this industry the effective market in fact is the local market and it is pointless trying to organise it on a national scale . Similarly , the production economies of one central brickworks might be very great , but these would be more than offset by the heavy transport costs involved in taking the finished product to the large number of scattered localities where it is wanted . Secondly , the nature of the industry may be such as to require small-scale production ; in agriculture and building , for example , activity is necessarily carried on over a wide geographical area and can not be centralised . Thirdly , the small firm ( being less complex in its organisation and having less extreme specialisation of capital and labour ) is frequently more flexible in its output , and can often respond more // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model to another in a mass-production car factory may involve the dislocation of output for several weeks or months , and will certainly involve enormous sums of capital ; a small and less specialised plant could probably absorb changes in design without any serious inconvenience . In markets where fashion is liable to dominate , or where demand is likely to oscillate for any other reason , this consideration may be of considerable importance . It is obviously crucial where each finished product is made to individual requirements ( as in tailoring or repair work ) rather than to some standardised pattern . Finally , forces of a technical nature are sometimes at work limiting the continued growth of a firm . A firm may become too complex for any single entrepreneur to control efficiently ; funds may not be available to finance further growth ; expensive selling and advertising campaigns may be necessary if a firm is to dispose of output by breaking into a competitor 's market ; and entrepreneurs are as subject to human inertia as most other people , with the result that they may not wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though they could increase their profits by doing so . Small-scale enterprise survives , and is likely to go on surviving , then , despite the apparently overwhelming technical advantages of large-scale production . In any industry , and at any time , there will theoretically be an optimum size for firms ; this will embody a compromise between all these conflicting forces ? technical factors tending to favour the large-scale firm , and market ( and other ) factors tending to favour the small firm . It is seldom possible in practice to identify this optimum size , because it will depend on factors such as the quality of the entrepreneur ( it is the amount of enterprise combined with the other factors which matters , not the number of entrepreneurs ) , and will in any case vary from time to time and industry to industry . All that can be said is that such an optimum can always be conceived of ? the size of firm which is such that , taking account of all the forces at work , its costs of production are reduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entrepreneur ? Theoretically the answer is clear ? the person ( or group ) ultimately responsible for production policy decisions and bearing the uncertainty inherent in the process of producing in advance of demand . In practice it is by no means always easy to be quite sure who actually performs these functions . This fact is brought out by a brief survey of the various forms in which economic enterprises are organised ; such a survey will also make it easier for this theoretical discussion of the factor of enterprise to be related to the actual economic world . The simplest form of industrial structure to be found in Britain is the one-man business , the firm which is owned and controlled by a single individual who takes an active part in the productive process but who may employ other people to assist him . This type of firm is most often seen in trades which of their nature favour smallscale output ? agriculture , retail trade , professional services etc. ? but is occasionally found in some branches of manufacturing industry . Here at least there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisation is that of the partnership , where two or more individuals own and control the firm . In general , such firms do not have limited liability ? that is , there is no limit beyond which the private wealth of the partners can not be claimed by creditors of the firm so as to secure payment of a debt ? although there are exceptions to this rule . Once again the problem of identifying the entrepreneurs is not very great , since the responsibility for policy decisions and the burden of uncertainty obviously is with the individual partners . In practice , however , some partners may take little active part in the running of the business , so that they implicitly transfer their entrepreneurial powers to the active partners . The most important form of business structure in this country is the registered joint-stock company , and the vast bulk of private industry is organised in this form . With a few special and relatively unimportant Acts , and are granted limited liability . This means that the persons who invest funds in the company , and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held responsible for any debts incurred by the company except to the extent to which they have contributed funds . For example , if a person holds shares to the value of 1,000 in a registered company , he could lose his ? t , 000 if the company was forced into bankruptcy , but a creditor would have no claim on the rest of the shareholder 's wealth even if some of the company 's debts remained unpaid . These companies may be of two types . A private joint-stock company is one in which at least two but not more than 50 persons hold shares . It is private in the sense that it is not required to publish an annual balance-sheet ; on the other hand it is not permitted to appeal to the public at large to contribute new capital . More important in practice is the public joint-stock company . Such a company is required to hold an annual meeting of shareholders and publish an annual balance-sheet , as well as to comply with a great many other legal requirements aimed at the protection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , they can offer securities for sale to the general public and so attract funds for the business . These securities may be of three main types . Debentures are acknowledgements of a debt amounting to a specified sum on which a fixed rate of interest is paid annually ; often they carry a promise of capital repayment by or on a certain date . Persons who purchase debentures are in no sense shareholders of the company ; they are simply creditors of the company entitled to the fixed annual interest payment and sometimes capital repayment on a specified date . If a company fails to meet these contractual interest or capital payments , for whatever reason , the debenture holder can have the company declared bankrupt and have its assets sold in order to regain his capital . The second main type of security is known as the preference share . Unlike the debenture holder , the holder of this type of security is not a creditor of the company ? he is a shareholder . This means that he has a claim to any profits the company may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fails to make any profit and is unable to pay him any return on his investment as a result . Like the debenture , however , the preference share bears a specified rate of dividend which must be paid before anyone else can share in the pro1 // fits . The debenture interest has to be paid before profits are arrived at ; the preference shareholder then has first claim on the profits , and until the specified rate of dividend has been paid to him no-one else can share in the profits . Some preference shares are cumulative , which means that if profits in any year are insufficient to enable the company to pay the full rate of dividend on its preference shares , then the deficiency must be made good in subsequent years before any other claimants to profits can receive anything . Usually , preference shareholders have no voting powers in the control of the company so long as their specified rate of dividend has been paid out . The third type of security is the ordinary share . The purchaser of an ordinary share has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled to share in whatever profits are made by the company over and above those needed to meet the prior claims of the holders of preference shares . The ordinary shareholder therefore bears the greater part of the risks of the enterprise ; the return on his investment may be zero for years on end , while , on the other hand , it may be very high indeed if the company succeeds . In normal times , the ordinary shareholders attend an annual general meeting at which the policy of the company is explained by a board of directors elected by them to manage the company on their behalf . If the shareholders are not satisfied , they may refuse to re-elect the board of directors and elect new directors from amongst their number . When an attempt is made to identify the entrepreneur in a private or public joint-stock company , the task is frequently difficult . In theory , the uncertainty inherent in economic enterprise lies unambiguously with the shareholders ; so does the ultimate responsibility for the policy decisions necessary to the running of the company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercised by the shareholders of a company is often very small ; provided a company continues to pay a reasonable dividend , most shareholders are content to let the board of directors look after the affairs of the company and do not even trouble to attend the annual general meetings . Hence the management of a large established company tends to take on an identity of its own , with the active directors and salaried managers regarding the general body of shareholders as a set of creditors who have to be placated but who // in no real sense participate in the policy-making . Ownership and control , therefore , the two ingredients of entrepreneurship , become divorced and the identity of the entrepreneur often tends in practice to be somewhat nebulous . This is even more so with other types of industrial organisation . Co-operative societies , for example , have a large number of small shareholders who theoretically control the societies but who in practice take little active part in policy-making . Public corporations or nationalised industries such as the Central Electricity Board , the B.B.C. , the Gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cally owned by the citizens of the whole country , but it is stretching the imagination to treat every voter as an entrepreneur in these industries . Effective power rests in the hands of the chairmen of the Boards concerned and , of course , the Minister responsible for them . // The Operation of Supply I. COST CURVES In the analysis of demand in a previous chapter it was noted that consumers could conceivably purchase commodities by offering other commodities in exchange for them ? i.e. through the process of barter . In fact , the modern economic world finds it more convenient to use money as an intermediary . Similarly , although the owners of factors of production could barter their services in return for a share in the goods they help to produce , in practice it is infinitely more convenient for all concerned if they place the services of those factors at the entrepreneur 's disposal in return for a money payment . Hence , labour is paid for by wages ( and salaries ) , land by rent , loan capital by interest and enterprise by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determining these factor-prices . Now , just as it is necessary to translate indifference maps into market demand curves , so the isoquant maps of the previous chapter need to be translated into cost curves . Demand curves trace out the relationship between the quantities of a commodity purchased and its various market prices ; cost curves trace out the relationship between the quantities of a commodity which enterprises are producing with its cost of production at the appropriate levels of output . An example of the translation of an isoquant map into a cost curve is given in Fig. 20 . Suppose that the production possibilities open to the entrepreneur are represented by the five isoquants shown in Fig. 20 ( a ) , relating to monthly outputs ranging from I , 000 to 5,000 units . Suppose also that the prevailing wagerate for the type of labour he needs is ? I0o a month and that the entrepreneur decides to construct a factory designed to produce a monthly output of 3,000. 130 // For the sake of convenience , the amount of capital employed is measured in Fig. zo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e. the annual cost ( interest and depreciation ) of the buildings and machinery divided by twelve . The relative price of capital and labour is thus registered by a line connecting ? i , 000 of capital with ten men , and so on . The analysis of the previous chapter has established that for his target output of 3,000 a month , the entrepreneur will achieve minimum unit cost at the tangency point X3 i.e. with a capital stock whose annual cost is ? 36,000 ( ? 3,000 a month ) , which in practice would probably represent a total capital stock of around ? 5oo,000 , and a labour force of 350 men . Having built his factory , the entrepreneur gradually brings it into full operation . He begins with a level of production which corresponds to i , 000 a month ; the relevant isoquant shows that , given his ( fixed ) capital stock , he will need to operate at point X i.e. with 50 men . When he steps up output to the z , 000-a-month level , he will move to point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force up to zoo . He can then proceed to his target output , taking on a further 50 men and reaching X3 . Suppose , however , that having done this he finds that the demand for his product is still unsatisfied . His capital stock is fixed for the moment ? the significance of this factor is investigated a little later // ? so that he can only reach a monthly output of 4,000 by moving to X4 and increasing his labour force to 220 . Similarly , if he wished to expand output even further to 5,000 a month , he would have to increase his labour force to 300 so as to reach X5 . The various combinations of the two factors at each level of output are thus determined , given , of course , his fixed capital stock . Knowing the current wage-rate ( LIoo a month ) these can be converted into total costs , and the division of this total by the rate of output will yield average cost per unit at each level of output . In this example the monthly cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plotted on a curve , an average cost curve such as AC in Fig. 20 ( b ) is obtained . Theoretically , of course , such a curve will trace out average costs at every level of output open to the entrepreneur , and not just five arbitrary levels such as those used in the example . The average cost curve therefore represents the cost to the entre preneur of the average amount of the factors used up in producing one unit of a commodity at different levels of output ? i.e. the total payments of wages , rent , interest and profits divided by the num ber of units produced . In other words , it reflects the costs of all the factors required to produce a commodity , including the factor of enterprise . Unless an entrepreneur receives a certain rate of profit from his activity , he will go to some other industry or perhaps become a wage- or salary-earner instead . Hence , a certain rate of profit ? the normal ' rate of profit for the entrepreneur concerned ? is part of the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element of the average cost curve . If price equals cost , there-fore , this does not mean ( as it might in everyday speech ) that the entrepreneur is making no profit ; it means that he is receiving the normal ' rate of profit on each unit of the commodity . In the discussion of demand curves , it was established that such // curves would normally be falling from left to right , although their exact slope would vary as between different commodities . In the case of cost curves , no such normal rule can be laid down , since average cost of production may increase , decrease or remain con stant as output expands . In other words , the production of a com modity may be taking place at any moment of time under any one of three broad types of supply conditions ? falling , constant or rising cost ? depending on the behaviour of the average cost curve as output rises . It is often convenient to draw cost curves with the same direction ( falling , horizontal or rising ) throughout their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most average cost curves will probably be more like that shown in Fig. 2i ? average cost falling as output expands and as the optimum combination of factors with a given level of normal ' capacity is approached , reaching a minimum at some output OM , where the optimum factor-combination is reached , then beginning to rise again as output expands past this level and the law of diminishing returns comes into effect . For example , most commodities require some minimum capital equipment , such as a factory building , however small output is . As output rises , this capital is used more and more fully until at last its normal capacity is reached . Thereafter it may not be worthwhile to install more capital ( build another factory , say ) until output is considerably greater , so that costs rise again as more and more labour is employed until the output is big enough to justify a second big lump ' of capital and the cost curve com mences to fall once more . // As with demand curves , the effects of output changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by reading off from a single curve ; if the basic conditions of production alter , a completely new curve has to be drawn , showing the cost of produc tion at each level of output under the new conditions just as a new demand curve has to be drawn whenever a shift in demand ( as distinct from a change in price ) occurs . Reference back to the hypothetical case of Fig. 20 , for instance , will illustrate this . For the cost curve shown in Fig. 20 ( b ) it was assumed that the entre preneur operated with a plant designed for an output of 3,000 units a month . If the calculation of costs at the various output levels is now repeated on the assumption that the plant had monthly capital costs of 2,500 ( i.e. designed for a monthly output of i , 000 ) or 5,000 ( i.e. designed for a monthly output of 5,000 ) , the result ing average costs would prove to be as follows : Clearly the whole cost structure is different in the two cases . Nor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of a shift in the cost curve ; changes in the state of technology , with an un changed capacity level , may have the same effect . For example , let the curve AC in Fig. 22 represent the cost curve of a given entrepreneur ; when the enterprise is producing OM units , the , average cost of producing the commodity is OP . Now a new method of production is discovered , or a new invention occurs , which enables a greater output to be obtained from any given quantity of resources . The cost curve is therefore shifted down-wards throughout its length , say to the position AC ' , and at the given output OM , average cost of production will fall to OP ' . Throughout this discussion the cost curve of an individual entre preneur , or firm , has been under consideration . Frequently the // supply of an industry as a whole is of more interest ? i.e. the total amount produced at different prices by all firms making the same commodity . To analyse this it is necessary to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this concept will be discussed in section 3 below . 2 . AVERAGE AND MARGINAL COST In talking of costs of production it has been assumed that in increasing or decreasing output certain costs ( notably labour costs ) can be increased or reduced without great difficulty whenever out-put changes , but others ( notably capital costs ) can not be changed for a considerable period , however much output may vary . This distinction , between factor-costs which can be varied whenever output changes and those which can not , is of great theoretical and practical significance . The former are usually called prime , or variable , costs and the latter overhead , or fixed costs . By variable costs are meant those which vary directly with out-put , even over a short period of time ; the major costs involved are those of labour and raw materials . If a firm making television sets finds that demand and price have fallen , so requiring a reduction of output , it can reduce its labour force more or less immediately , so cutting its total labour costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinets etc. and can reduce its purchases of these forth-with . Certain costs can not be changed so quickly , however , and these are called fixed costs . These are commitments which remain at a constant level so long as the firm remains in existence at all , // whatever its level of output , or can be changed only after the lapse of a considerable period ? for example , the rent of the land on which the factory stands , the interest on the capital locked up in the form of plant and machinery , and the salaries of the essential managerial and administrative staff . The payments under these headings are usually fixed for long periods at a time and have no direct connection with the rate of production at all except in the long run . A striking example of the independence of such costs is provided by the publishing trade . Once it is decided to publish a book , the entrepreneur must incur the cost of having it set up in type , ready for printing ; however many copies he subsequently produces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies which are in fact printed , the greater the volume of production over which this fixed ( and major ) element in total cost can be spread . Similarly , once the British Electricity Authority has built and equipped a power-station , it incurs a fixed charge in respect of the cost of the buildings and equipment concerned , whatever the rate at which the station is generating electricity . As a result , there can be , and usually is , a significant difference between the average cost of a unit of output and the additional cost incurred in increasing production by one unit ? i.e. the marginal cost . The average cost of a particular unit , of course , is the total cost incurred by the entrepreneur divided by the total number of units produced . The marginal cost of a unit of production , say the xth unit , is the difference between the total cost of producing x units and the total cost of producing ( x ? i ) units . Consider an example of the furniture trade ; suppose that the data shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only fixed cost is assumed to be that of an initial set of tools sufficient to provide up to 10 tables per week and costing ? too . After that , the production of each table requires materials and labour , including that of the entrepreneur himself , these amounting to 5o per table for outputs of up to 3 per week . When output passes the level of 3 per week , however , the entrepreneur has to pay his workers relatively high overtime rates , or increase his general wage-level to attract new labour , or obtain his wood from more and more distant sources , so that variable costs rise progressively . The Operation of Supply - 137 For the first table , the total cost of production will therefore be 150 ; since only one table is involved , this is also its average cost . The difference between the total costs of producing this table ( ? I50 ) and the total costs of producing one fewer ( i.e. none at all ) is 150 , so that this is also its marginal cost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , average and marginal costs differ con siderably . The marginal cost at first falls rapidly as the fixed cost is spread over an increasing number of tables , and average cost also falls , though not so violently . When output rises above that of 3 a week , however , marginal costs begin to rise . For a time the effect of this is more than offset by the gain arising from spreading the fixed cost over a larger output , and average cost continues to fall . So long as marginal cost is less than average cost , of course , the average must fall ; a smaller amount than the average is being added to the total and naturally the overall average is reduced . Ultimately , however ( in this example when output rises to 6 tables a week ) , marginal cost becomes greater than the average cost , and the average begins to rise ; the increasingly high variable costs become more than sufficient to offset the spreading of the fixed cost . Once again , however , the average will change less violently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marginal costs can be shown more generally with the familiar curve diagram . In Fig. 23 , // which is based on the data contained in Table VII , the curve AC is the type of cost curve which was discussed earlier ; it shows the average cost of production at various levels of output . On the same axes OX and 0Y can be drawn the marginal cost curve , MC . Cer tain general rules can be laid down about the behaviour of these two curves . First , so long as the marginal cost curve is below the average cost curve , then average cost must be falling as output rises . This is straight-forward enough ; as has already been noted , if marginal cost is below average cost expanding output must be adding a smaller amount to total costs than the previous average , so that the new average will be smaller than the old . Similarly , if marginal costs are in excess of the average it means that the average must be rising ; a bigger amount is added to total cost than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average must therefore be bigger than the old . Finally , if marginal cost equals average cost , then average cost is neither rising nor falling at that point ? in other words , average cost is at its minimum ; it has ceased falling but has not yet begun to increase . // 3 . SUPPLY CURVES So far the discussion has been confined to the individual firm ? the curves which have been considered show the relationship existing between the output of a particular firm and its average or marginal cost of production . For many purposes , however , the total supply of a commodity on the market may be of more interest than the output of one firm producing only a fraction of that total ; in considering how the price of milk affects its supply , for example , it is the total output of milk which will be the object of interest , not the production of any individual dairy farmer . For problems such as these , it is necessary to shift the emphasis away from the firm and on to the industry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply of the commodity concerned to the market . In other words , the discussion must move away from the cost curve of the individual enterprise and focus attention on the supply curve of the industry as a whole ? the curve which relates the supply of a commodity to its market price . Before considering the way in which such a supply curve can be built up , it must be made clear that the question involves certain rather difficult issues which are better dealt with separately at a later stage and which will have to be left on one side for the moment . For example , it is by no means easy to define what exactly is meant by an industry ' ; if firms are selling products which are similar but not identical ? such as Cadbury 's chocolate and Fry 's chocolate ? are these firms in the same industry or not ? How similar do products have to be before they can be regarded as the same commodity ? A second , and related , difficulty is that of the relationship which is assumed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far they are regarded as competing with one another , and how far monopoly elements exist . These issues have a great deal to do with the relationship between price and output , as will be demonstrated at length in Chapters to-t3 . In order to examine the essential nature of the concept of the supply curve , however , these complications can be left on one side . For the moment it can be supposed that there exists a group of firms whose products are more or less identical , so that they can be regarded collectively as forming a single industry . Further , let it be // supposed that these firms are in full competition with one another , the output of each individual firm being so small a share of total production in the industry that changes in it have no effect on either market price or the output of the other firms . In such a situation it is clear that a change in the market price for which the commodity is being sold will affect its total supply in one of two ways . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulate changes in the output of each individual firm in the industry , within the broad limits imposed by their ( for the moment fixed ) capacity in terms of capital equipment . Secondly , however , if the change in price is sufficiently permanent , existing firms will ultimately make appropriate adjustments to their basic capacity and new firms will enter the industry ( or existing firms leave the industry ) . For example , suppose the market price of a commodity rises . Firms already in the industry were finding it profitable to produce at the old , lower price . Their new rate of profit per unit of output must therefore be higher than before , and ( since they are assumed to be seeking to maximise profit ) they will expand production under the spur of these higher profit rates . How far will they expand output ? In the previous section the cost of each additional unit of output was described as the marginal cost ; so long as the revenue per unit received by a producer ( i.e. , in this simple case , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than , or equal to , marginal cost the producer is obviously increasing his total profit . When the price rises , then , each firm will expand production up to that point at which its marginal cost becomes equal to the market price . A numerical example may help to show how the total supply of a commodity will respond to changes in market price through adjustments to the output of firms in the industry . Suppose that the figures shown in Table VIII represent the marginal costs at different levels of output of an industry composed of five firms and that the period of time being considered is too short to allow either adjustments to the capacity-level of any of these firms or the establishment of new firms in the industry . For the sake of simplicity of exposition , it is assumed that each firm has rising marginal costs at all levels of production , although ( as was noted in the previous section ) this state of affairs is unlikely to occur in the real world . // Suppose the market price settles initially at 2s. ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover its costs at an output rate of ioo units , but none can profitably produce more than this level of output . The total supply at the market price of 2s. will therefore be 500 units . Now suppose market price rises to 48 . At this price , Company i will expand its output to 300 units , since it is only at levels of output higher than this that its marginal cost exceeds the market price of 4s . Companies 2 and 4 will similarly raise their output to Zoo units each and Company 3 to 500 units , since price is high enough to cover marginal cost at these output levels . It is not high enough , however , to permit Company 5 to increase its output above the zoo level . Total supply at the market price of 4s. , therefore , will rise to 1,300 units ? 300 produced by Company 1 , zoo each by Companies 2 and 4 , Soo by Company 3 and loo by Company 5 . If this process is continued for different market prices , a schedule can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commodity which will be supplied at each price . The data in Table VIII , for example , show that at a market price of 2os. total supply will amount to 3,900 units ? i , 000 produced by Company 1 , 70o by Company 2 , 1,000 by Company 3 , loo by Company 4 and Soo by Company 5 . If all these prices and outputs are now plotted in the form of a graph , the result is a supply curve for the industry concerned . An example is shown by the curve SS ' in Fig. 24 ; this curve is in fact I42 Textbook of Economic Analysis drawn from the data shown in Table VIII . It is a short-run supply curve , of course , since it is based on data which assume that the capacity of existing firms is fixed and that the number of firms can not change . It is also based on a highly simplified and not particularly realistic example ; it is manifestly unlikely , for example , that the marginal cost of a product should rise , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zs. for the Tooth unit to 6s. for the moist . This does not affect the principle of the derivation of supply curves , however , and this is the only important issue here . Such curves , of course , will normally slope upwards from left to right , reflecting the familiar economic generalisation that a greater quantity of any commodity will be offered at a high price than at a low price . The higher price is , the more profitable production becomes and the greater the output which each entrepreneur will find it worthwhile to produce . It was noted in a previous section that , just as changes in tastes , incomes or the prices of related products could cause the demand curve for a particular commodity to shift bodily to left or right , so a change in the fundamental conditions of production ( an adjustment of capacity or an invention ) can cause cost curves to shift to right or left . Since supply curves are in effect built up from a group of individual cost curves , it follows that supply curves may // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technological developments . Hence , if the market price ruling for a particular commodity and the quantities of it supplied by an industry were correlated over a long period of time , it might well be found that the supply of the commodity was greater when prices were relatively low than when price had been high . This would not mean that the supply curve existing at any given point of time was downward-sloping , however , but merely that a normal ' , upward-sloping supply curve has been shifting through time as the result of developments in the scale or technical methods of production . Like demand curves , once again , supply curves can seldom , if ever , be constructed in reality . It is doubtful if many individual firms would be in a position to draw up curves showing their cost of production at various outputs , except in the very vaguest and most general terms ; it would be statistically impossible to obtain such data on a comparable basis from all the firms in an industry ( even assuming that the problems of defining an industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve for the industry as a whole . Such curves are nevertheless a valuable analytical device . They enable the principles underlying the relationships between price , cost and output to be embodied in a visual and convenient form , so that they can be set out against a similar representation of the fac-tors at work on the side of demand . In this way , a large number of complex and interdependent influences can be brought together into a single analytical process , and their probable effects can be illustrated in a way which would otherwise be impossible without the use of fairly forbidding mathematics . One final qualification is necessary . Throughout this discussion , output has Been assumed to depend solely on price and cost , and supply has been identified with production . In the real world , neither procedure is wholly justifiable . The output of firms , or an industry as a whole , may vary without any change in prices or costs ? because of adverse weather , for example , or an epidemic amongst the labour force , or bombing by an enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influences on production , simply because they are not of an economic character , and the economist has no authority to pronounce on them . The identity of supply with production is less defensible . If // prices change in the market , an important consequence may be , and often is , the accumulation or running-down of stocks of goods by wholesalers and retailers , while such changes in stocks may in turn exert significant pressure on market price . The existence of stocks , in other words , breaks the direct connection between the current production and actual supply of goods offered to consumers . If traders believe that the price of a commodity is going to rise , they may try to accumulate stocks of it in order to sell the commodity after its price has risen , while expectations of a fall in price may result in an unloading of stocks on to the market in an attempt to sell before the price falls . Whether these expectations are wellfounded or erroneous , stock changes of this kind can exert a considerable influence on the available supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any changes at all in current output . The complications introduced into the analysis by the existence of stocks can be ignored at this stage , however , for two reasons . First , it is obviously desirable to obtain a clear picture of the fundamental relationships between price , cost and output , and to do this it is advisable to leave subsidiary considerations on one side for the moment , even though they may be of considerable importance in practice . Secondly , most commodities deteriorate in one way or another if they are stored for any length of time , so that over a fairly long period changes in stock positions tend to cancel one another out . The supply of a commodity over the long period is determined primarily by the level of production ; stock changes can exert a significant but essentially temporary effect on its price . 4 . THE SIGNIFICANCE OF TIME IN SUPPLY In dealing with the effects of a change in price on demand , or or changes in demand on price , it was possible to ignore the possible delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in the other . In practice , such delays are unlikely to be long ; even if they occurred they would not materially affect the previous analysis of reactions between demand and price . In considering the supply of goods , however , delays , or time-lags , are of considerable significance ; this is because in the real world considerable time may elapse before production is fully adjusted to changes in price ( factories and shipyards can not be built overnight ) and also because // such time-lags have important implications for theoretical analysis . In distinguishing between fixed and variable costs a rather general reference was made to the degree to which they could be adjusted ( upwards or downwards ) in a relatively short period of time . To be more precise , economists distinguish between the short and long periods . By the short period is meant that space of time in which the productive capacity of an industry can not be fully adjusted to a change in demand ; by the long period is meant the space of time in which capacity can be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing firms in the industry ( i.e. the increase or reduction of factory space , the installation or elimination of plant and machinery , and so on ) , or through the entry of new firms into the industry , or departure of firms from it , or , of course , some combination of the two . For example , if the demand for transatlantic sea travel increases , shipping firms will be forced to meet the increase by working their existing ships and crews on more frequent trips and by bringing into use ships and crews which for one reason or another had previously been laid up . This will seldom be satisfactory as a permanent solution , however , and if the increase in demand is believed to be permanent new ships will be ordered and new crews recruited and trained . When the new ships and crews are finally put into service , and capacity is fully adjusted to the new level of demand , then the long-period equilibrium will be reached ; prior to that time the situation prevailing will be a short-period one . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of calendar time will naturally vary from industry to industry . In the cotton spinning trade , for example , it may be only a matter of a few months before new equipment can be installed and additional operatives trained ; in the case of air transport , five or six years may elapse before new aircraft can be delivered and additional crews be provided . A second point to note is that the long period may have different lengths in terms of calendar time according as to whether capacity is being expanded or contracted . In general , a factor such as labour can be dismissed more rapidly than it can be obtained , especially if a fairly high degree of skill is required . On the other hand , capital wears out relatively slowly ; it may take several years for a machine to pass out of use through wear and tear , whereas a new one could // perhaps be manufactured in a few months . A producer faced with a reduced demand , and therefore with excess capital equipment , can reduce his capital only at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no point in deliberately destroying it ; he would obtain no benefit from that . ) The best he can do is to spend no more money on it ? i.e. omit to maintain it in a full state of repair and allow it to wear out gradually . This process may take several years . There are two reasons why this distinction between the short period and the long period is important in economic analysis . The first is that it has implications for the price and output policy adopted by producers in the face of a change in demand . Consider the case of a producer who is suddenly faced with a fall in the market price for his product . The new price is below his minimum average cost of production , although at certain levels of output it exceeds his marginal cost . What effect will this have on his output ? In the long run , clearly , unless some readjustment of his capacity will reduce average cost sufficiently , he will abandon production , since it is impossible for him to sell at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means follows , however , that he will cease production immediately . In the short run his overhead costs are fixed , and he will have to meet them whether he produces or not . If he can sell his product at a price which covers his marginal ( i.e. variable ) costs , therefore , he is no worse off than he would be if he stopped production altogether ; if revenue exceeds marginal cost ( even if it is still insufficient to meet average cost ) he will make some contribution towards his overhead costs , and will be better off than he would be if he shut down completely . This explains why producers often continue to sell at less than their average cost of production , especially in industries of a highly capitalistic nature where overhead costs form a large proportion of total cost . In the long run , of course , when overhead costs can be reduced , an entrepreneur will reduce his output until price covers his average cost or will go out of business altogether . All this indicates that the short-run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very different . It has been established earlier that the short-run supply curve is derived from the marginal cost curves of the individual firms in it , and is indeed a summation of them . It is obvious that this will not do for the long run , // when it is not enough for entrepreneurs to cover their variable costs ? all of their costs must be met if they are to stay in business . Price , in other words , must be such as to cover average and not merely marginal costs . It has also been established that in the long run , when entrepreneurs are able to re-adjust capacity to suit new conditions , entirely new cost curves may come into operation . It follows that the long-run supply curve of an industry will be derived from a whole series of average cost curves , one correspond ing to each adjustment of capacity made in the industry over time . An example is given in Fig. 25 ( a ) . Suppose that in the first in-stance the industry is operating at output OMI , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average cost is therefore MN , . Demand now rises , and output increases to OM2 . In the short run , capacity is fixed and the curve AC , remains the operative one ; the output OM2 can be achieved , therefore , only at the average cost M2N2 . After sufficient time to adjust capacity , however , the cost curve shifts over to AC2 and the average cost of output OM2 can be reduced ( to M2A ) , and this would be true for all outputs corres ponding to points to the right of X1 . On the other hand , for outputs smaller than this ? corresponding to points to the left of Xi ? the original capacity level , reflected in ACl , would yield lower average costs than that reflected in AC2 . Similarly , if output rises further to OM3 costs will rise in the first instance to M3N3i when sufficient time has elapsed for capacity to be properly adjusted , however , the operative cost curve will become AC3 and the cost of output OM3 will be cut to an average of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity will yield lower average costs for any output corresponding to a point to the right of X2 ; for outputs between X1 and X2 the second level of capacity will be preferable . In other words , when time is allowed for capacity adjustments at all points , two facts emerge : first , average cost becomes the determining factor , not marginal cost ; secondly , only those parts of the three curves shown in Fig. 25 ( a ) by a heavy line become relevant and operative ; the long-run supply curve of the industry , that is to say , is given by the scalloped curve SX1X2S ' . Theoretically , short-run average cost curves can be drawn for every possible scale of output , and if the number of curves is very large the scalloping element will become negligible ; a smooth envelope ' curve , like SS ' in Fig. 25 ( b ) , can be drawn for the whole possible range of output . This long-run supply curve , of course , may be falling , horizontal or rising from left to right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes place under conditions of increasing returns ? economies of scale ? constant or diminishing returns . The curve shown in Fig. 25 ( b ) has the shape usually assumed for industrial expansion in the long run ? increasing returns as the industry grows sufficiently to exploit the economies of scale , a period of constant average costs and then rising average costs as the complexities and limitations of very large-scale enterprises give rise to diminishing returns . When the average or marginal cost of production is in question , therefore , a great deal may turn on whether the operative supply curve is a short-run or long-run curve . The second reason why time is of especial importance in the analysis of supply is that the concept of elasticity of supply is inseparable from the interval of time being considered . In the case of demand , time can reasonably be ignored in analysing elasticity ; the response of demand to price can be assumed to be immediate without introducing too much unreality . In the case of supply , however , the time element must be taken into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differ considerably . Elasticity of supply can be defined as the responsiveness of output to a change in market price , but it can not be measured without specifying the period of time over which this responsiveness is examined . In the short run , as has been seen , cost curves tend to become steep // fairly quickly , so that quite a large rise in price will call forth a relatively small increase in output . The longer the time allowed for the adjustment of capacity , however , the more elastic supply will tend to become . As between industries , many factors will enter into the determination of relative elasticity of supply . An industry using highly specialised capital or labour , for example , will find it more difficult ( and probably more expensive ) to increase its capacity than one which uses relatively unspecialised and unskilled factors . Again , an enterprise making more than one product would possess an elastic supply potential for either one of them since it could switch its resources from one product to another fairly quickly if a change occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence elasticity ? the supply of agricultural products is notoriously inelastic , for example , since a farmer , having once sown or prepared his fields , can do little about altering his output until the following season , however much prices fluctuate . 5 . JOINT SUPPLY Reference has just been made to the possibility of a single firm making more than one product . Where the products concerned are not the outcome of a single productive process no special problems arise . Although production may be located in a single factory , the firm can be conceived of as two or more separate enterprises operating in two or more industries , and independent cost curves can be drawn up for each product . The situation is less straightforward , however , if the process of producing one commodity is technically connected with that of producing another , as frequently happens . In such a situation , the commodities involved would be spoken of as joint products , meaning that a single productive process results in the production of two or more products . The production of coal gas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rearing beef cattle necessarily results in the production of hides ; supplying planks for a timber-yard also increases the supply of sawdust . The major problem raised in these situations , where an increase or decrease in the production of one commodity automatically involves an increase or decrease in the output of another , is that of 1 50 Textbook of Economic Analysis attributing costs of production to either . If gas and coke are produced by the same operation , how can the total cost of production be allocated between the two products ? More important , how can the marginal cost of either product be calculated ? ? further analysis will show that it is marginal cost which plays the vital role so far as an individual producer is concerned in determining the equilibrium level of price and output in a free market . Two types of situation can be distinguished . In one it is technically impossible to vary the relative amounts of the products emerging from the productive process ? the cultivation of raw cotton , for example , involves the production of a more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one product can only be taken as the total cost of producing an extra amount of both products minus the extra revenue brought in from the increased output of the joint product . Where the proportions can be varied , however ( the amount of straw produced in conjunction with wheat can be altered by changing the type of seed employed , for example ) , the marginal cost of one product can be defined as the cost of increasing its output by one unit in such a way as to maintain an unchanged output of the joint product . The same distinction must be borne in mind in considering the effects of an increase in the supply of one product on the price of the product associated with it . If the proportions of the joint products can not be varied , an increased output of one , called forth by a rise in demand , will necessarily result in an increase in the output of the other and therefore ( assuming the demand for the latter is unchanged ) a fall in its price . On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in the output of one product can occur without any increase in the output of the other ( or , indeed , may be associated with a fall in the output of the other ) so that the price of the joint product may be unchanged or may even rise . Once again the time element is frequently important . It often happens that the proportions in which joint products are supplied can be altered in the long run but not in the short run . The relative amounts of wool and mutton produced by a sheep-farmer , for example , can be varied by switching from one breed of sheep to another , but obviously this is a process which will take some considerable time . In the short run , therefore , an increased output of // one joint product will usually involve an increase in the output of the other , and hence a fall in its price . In the long run , on the other hand , the proportions in which the products are supplied can usually be varied , so that an increased demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . 6 . OPPORTUNITY COST Throughout this discussion of supply and cost of production , the expression cost ' has been taken to mean the money payments which an entrepreneur is forced to make in order to obtain the services of the various factors of production . In reality factors are obtained through money payments , and in economic analysis cost ' is therefore generally used in this sense . There is another , and more fundamental , sense in which the word cost ' can be used , however . Money is merely a device which is used in the everyday world because of its great convenience ; underlying monetary transactions , however , are the real sacrifices inherent in the scarcity of resources in relation to our needs . Hence the concept of opportunity ' cost is occasionally used to get behind the monetary veil to the fundamental realities which it tends to conceal . By the opportunity cost of production is meant the alternative uses of factors of production which are necessarily sacrificed by using those resources in a particular way . The money cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its production by way of wages , rent , interest and profit ; its opportunity cost is the desk , or chairs , or cricket bats which could have been made with the same resources but which are sacrificed by using them to make a table . This concept of the opportunity cost of production is constantly recurring in various contexts . For example , wages in a particular industry are determined partly by what labour could obtain in other industries , and this will be a measure of the opportunity cost of labour . Again , a country may find that to increase a defence programme it is necessary for it to go without motor-cars which would have been supplied to it by an industry now occupied in making tanks and aircraft . For the community as a whole , as opposed to the individual producer or consumer , this concept of opportunity cost is more meaningful than that of money cost . The reason for this is that it brings clearly and unambiguously before our minds // the fundamental reality of the economic world ? that resources are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to con sume ; that , given full employment , using resources in one way implies a sacrifice of their alternative uses ; that we can not eat our cake and have it . PART IV THE THEORY OF PRICE CHAPTER IO The Nature of Market Equilibrium 1 . PRICES , COMMODITIES AND MARKETS aving discussed at some length the nature of the forces influencing , on the one hand , the demand for goods and services , and , on the other , the supply of goods and services , - it is now necessary to turn to an examination of the way in which demand and supply interact , and thus to find an explanation of the determination of the price of any commodity in the market . Before going further , the meaning of three important words in that last sentence must be made quite clear : price , commodity and market . The word price ' will not give much trouble . In a modern economy goods are exchanged not directly but through the medium of money , and by price is meant the sum of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain ownership of the commodity concerned . Nevertheless price is a little more complicated than this ; in treating it an economist may be concerned with either absolute or relative prices ? that is , he can be seeking to answer either the question Why are pencils 4d. ? ' or the question Why is the price of pencils only one-tenth the price of a packet of cigarettes ? ' It is with the second kind of problem that the analysis is concerned for the moment ? i.e. the problem of the causes underlying the value of one commodity relatively to that of other commodities . The problem of the absolute level of prices will be discussed later on . An unambiguous definition of the word commodity ' is rather more difficult . In a general , and rather loose , way a commodity can be spoken of as being a good , or service , for which there is no close substitute and which satisfies a particular , distinct want felt by consumers . Unfortunately , the identification of a particular commodity is very difficult in practice , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Is the demand 155 // for tea a demand for tea-drinking as such , or is it simply one part of the demand for beverages , and hence met by coffee , cocoa and a dozen other fluids as well as tea ? And is tea the commodity , or is Indian tea a different commodity from China tea ? ; is Lipton 's tea a different commodity from Lyons ' tea ? How close does a substitute have to become before it ceases to be a separate commodity ? This kind of difficulty arises with almost every product in the economic system , and presents virtually insoluble problems . In speaking of a commodity ' in the sense mentioned above , then , a fairly drastic over-simplification is being made in order to render the analysis at all manageable , and the real world is considerably more complex and less clear-cut than the analytical picture of it . Finally , the word market ' has to be defined . In everyday speech the word is frequently used to mean a building or area of ground in which trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used much more widely , and refers to all the persons and institutions concerned in the exchange of any commodity. , , In this sense it can include an entire country , or even the whole world , if people buying or selling a commodity are in contact with one another over those areas . On the other hand , a market may mean only a handful of people , if the persons in contact with one another for the purpose of exchanging some commodity are few in number . In any case , a market in this sense will have no single physical location ; the person encouraged by an effective advertisement to buy a commodity in his local shop will be unknown to its manufacturer , who is perhaps thousands of miles away , but they are nevertheless both part of the market for that commodity . 2 . INDUSTRY AND FIRM : THE DEMAND CURVE Assume that an individual commodity can be defined closely enough for the present analysis . By a firm is meant any group of factors of production operating under the direction of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms engaged in the production of the commodity with which the analysis is concerned . Now this distinction between firm and industry is an important one , and it will underly all the analysis of the various possible types of market situation with which this book will have to deal . In partiThe // cular , the distinction has important implications for two things : the demand curve involved in the analysis and the equilibrium conditions which have to be satisfied . Consider the implications for the demand curve first of all . For the industry as a whole , the relevant demand curve is that for the commodity ( since it is total demand and supply which is involved when the industry is considered ) and it will therefore be of the type discussed in Chapter 4 . Now , in the earlier discussion of those curves the analysis was concerned with the relationship between the quantity purchased and the commodity 's price , and such a curve can therefore be called an average revenue curve . Every unit of the commodity has to be sold on the market at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were divided by his total sales , his average revenue per unit of output , which will obviously be the same thing as its price , would be arrived at . But just as economists distinguish between average and marginal cost , so a distinction can be drawn between average and marginal revenue . If average revenue is equal to the total receipts from the sale of a commodity divided by the total number of units of the commodity sold , then marginal revenue is equal to the change in total receipts brought about by a change of one unit in the total number of units of the commodity which are sold . At first sight it may seem that , as all units of a commodity are sold at the same price , marginal revenue ( as so defined ) must be the same thing as the price at which the marginal unit is sold , and therefore the same thing as average revenue . But this is not necessarily so . The essential point about the falling demand curve ( i.e. one sloping downwards from left to right ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price ( of all units ) has to be reduced ; the marginal revenue from one unit of output is therefore the price at which it is sold minus the fall in revenue from all the other units of output which the sellers have to offer at a lower price than before in order to persuade the market to absorb this extra , marginal unit . Given a stable demand curve of the usual , downward-sloping type , marginal revenue must always be less than price ; it may even be negative . Consider the example shown numerically in Table IX and diagrammatically in Fig 26 . In order to increase sales , the price of the commodity has to be progressively reduced . As a result , the total z5$ Textbook of Economic Analysis revenue rises as sales increase up the sixth unit , although it in-creases less and less rapidly as the market price is reduced . After the sixth unit total revenue actually declines , since the expansion of sales is insufficient to offset the decline in price necessary to secure it ( i.e. elasticity of demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue becomes negative . Wherever the demand curve is falling then , as it usually is for the output of an industry as a whole , a distinction must be drawn be tween average revenue , or price ( the average receipts per unit at each level of output ) and marginal revenue ( the addition to total receipts resulting from the last unit produced ) . 3 . INDUSTRY AND FIRM : EQUILIBRIUM CONDITIONS The second context in which the distinction between firm and industry is important is that of the conditions necessary for equili brium . It will be remembered that in economics by equilibrium is meant a situation in which there exists no tendency towards change . For an industry , then , equilibrium means a situation in which there is no tendency for new firms to enter it or for existing firms to leave it ; for a firm , it means that the entrepreneur has no incentive either to increase or to reduce his output . Under what conditions will such equilibrium situations be achieved ? // Consider first the industry , which on this occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of normal ' profit was introduced , by which was meant the rate of reward which the entrepreneur concerned could expect to earn in any industry open to him . Now , entrepreneurs will be attracted into an industry if the average rate of profit being earned in it is above this normal level , and they will tend to move out of an industry if they are earning in it less than this normal level . Equilibrium , for the industry , means that firms are neither moving in nor moving out ; it means , therefore , that the level of profits in it is neither above nor below the normal level , and hence is equal to it . When will this normal level of profit be attained ? The average amount received by entrepreneurs per unit of output is given by the average revenue or price curve ? the demand curve discussed at some length in Chapter 4 . The amount paid out by entrepreneurs per unit of output including the normal profit due to them in respect of their own contribution is given by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , that entrepreneurs are receiving normal profits , no more and no less , when average cost equals average revenue , or price . If average cost is above price , then they are earning something less than normal profit per unit ; if average cost is below price , then they are earning excess ( i.e. above normal ) profit . For any industry open to possible new entrants to be in equilibrium , average cost must equal average revenue . Turn now to the firm . The basic assumption in all economic analysis is that each person is seeking to maximise his economic wellbeing and acts rationally towards that end . It follows that the entrepreneur must be assumed to seek the maximum profit from his firm . So long as a firm is in existence at all , the entrepreneur will produce the output which brings in the greatest profit or the smallest loss . When is this situation reached ? Here the two concepts of marginal revenue and marginal cost must be brought together . Marginal revenue is the addition to total receipts arising from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to total cost which it incurs for the entrepreneur . Now , if an entrepreneur by increasing his output can add more to his total receipts than he adds to his total cost , obviously he is increasing his total profit . If he adds more to cost than to receipts , he is reducing his total profit . He will 16o Textbook of Economic Analysis maximise his profits , then , when marginal cost equals marginal revenue . The example shown in Fig. 27 illustrates this graphically . Let the curve MR represent the marginal revenue brought in by each unit of output and MC the addition to total cost made by each unit . The entrepreneur 's profits will be maximised at output 0M , , where the curves intersect and marginal revenue equals marginal cost . At any smaller output , say OM2i it will be possible to increase total profit , since the extra cost involved in expanding output ( M2N2 ) is smaller than the extra receipts which the extra output would earn ( M2Q2 ) . At any larger output , say 0M3i the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs ( M3Q3 ) . At output OM1 , where the curves intersect , the entrepreneur adds just enough to his revenue to cover the marginal cost of production and his own normal profit . For full equilibrium in an industry , then , it is necessary to have ( a ) the number of firms in the industry constant and ( b ) the output of each firm constant . For ( a ) the necessary condition is that the profits made by entrepreneurs should be at the normal level , which means that average cost must equal average revenue , or price , at the ruling level of output . For ( b ) the necessary condition is that each entrepreneur is making the maximum profit possible , which means that marginal cost must equal marginal revenue at the ruling level of output . In full equilibrium , therefore , each firm will be producing that output at which average cost equals average revenue and marginal cost equals marginal revenue . // One last word of warning should perhaps be added . The fact that a producer is maximising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an optimum from an economic point of view . The optimum output is that at which the factors are combined in the most effi cient way ? i.e. the output at which average cost of production is at its lowest point . This output may be that which yields the producer maximum profit ( i.e. marginal cost may equal marginal revenue at the point of minimum average cost ) ; as the succeeding chapter shows , however , this occurs only in the special and limiting case of perfect competition . CHAPTER II Price under Perfect Competition I. WHAT IS PERFECT COMPETITION ? At t s a starting-point for the explanation of the process whereby he exchange value of a commodity is determined , it is convenient to postulate a hypothetical situation called perfect competition . No-one suggests that such a situation has ever existed for other than a few exceptional commodities ; the hypothesis is used merely as a simple framework in which the essential factors are analysed before moving closer towards the infinitely more complex situation which exists in the real world . Many subjects learnt at school ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usefulness in later life , but that by no means implies that the study of them is useless . The important thing is that they help people to think in a careful and systematic way when faced with a particular type of problem , and in this way may contribute a great deal to their work in later years . So it is with the concept of perfect competition . It is most unlikely that perfect competition will ever be seen in the real world , but , nevertheless , through its study it is possible to acquire a system of approach which in due course will help a great deal in tackling the more complex situations which are in fact encountered in the real world . T:state of perfect competition , then , is a purely hypothetical one . To the economist , it implies the absence of monopoly power ? i.e. the absence of any power on the part of any individual firm or consumer to influence market prices . In it certain things are assumed about each of the two groups of persons involved in economic exchange ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is concerned , it is assumed , first , that there is a large number of sellers competing with one another ? sufficiently large a number , that is , for each seller to be contributing an infinitely small part of the total supply , and hence to be unable to affect the market price i6a // significantly by changes in his output . Secondly , it is assumed that each producer ( being a very small element in total production ) has a perfectly elastic supply of the factors of production ; he can in-crease his output , in other words , without driving up the level of wages , rent or interest currently prevailing in the industry . Thirdly , it is assumed that there are no restrictions on the free entry of firms into the industry or their movement out of it . Finally , each pro ducer is assumed to . bp aware of the rate of profit being made by every other producer So far as the demand side is concerned , it is assumed again that the number of consumers is so large that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by altering the scale of his purchases . Secondly , all buyers are assumed to have perfect know-ledge of the price being asked for the commodity concerned in every part of the market , and it is supposed that neither transport costs nor inertia prevent them from taking advantage of any diver gence in price which might develop in different parts of the market . Finally , buyers are assumed to have no preference as between the various producers of the commodity ? that is , that there are no differences , actual or imaginary , between the product of one firm in the industry and that of any other firm in the industryw This is a formidable collection of assumptions ? such so that it is worth repeating that their purpose is solely to put on one side , for the moment , the large number of subsidiary influences which usually operate , and to expose the basic forces common to all markets . To attempt an analysis of the highly complex markets of the real world , where these simplifying assumptions do not hold , without first clarifying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impossible ; it would be setting out on Scarlatti without first mastering the scale . 2 . THE DEMAND CURVE UNDER PERFECT COMPETITION Consider the demand curve facing the individual firm in this hypothetical situation of perfect competition ; it will be convenient to refer to this as the sales curve so as to prevent confusion with the demand curve for the commodity facing the industry as a whole . Since the firm 's product will be identical ( by definition ) with that of the rest of the industry , it might seem that its sales curve will be 164 Textbook of Economic Analysis the same as that facing the industry as a whole ? i.e. downward-sloping , as in Fig. z6 . This is not the case , however , as will become clear by recalling the assumptions of the situation of perfect compe tition . By hypothesis , each firm is producing so small a part of the industry 's total sales that no change in its output can perceptibly influence price . Whatever its output , therefore , the individual firm sells at the ( given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horizontal line drawn through the market price , OP , as in Fig. 28 , and extending over the whole range of its possible output . Can a separate marginal revenue curve be drawn in this case ? Obviously it can not ; if each unit is sold at a constant price , each one must add exactly the same amount to total receipts as every other unit . Here there is only price to consider ; there is no adjustment necessary because of the price-reduction enforced by increased sales , because no price-reduction is involved . For the firm in perfect competition , then , average revenue , or price , and marginal revenue coincide . It may seem rather odd that each firm in an industry should face a horizontal ( i.e. perfectly elastic ) sales curve while the firms col lectively face a falling demand curve . How can the addition of a large number of horizontal curves result in the industry 's falling curve ? The answer is that the individual sales curves facing each firm can not legitimately be added up . Each of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry maintains a constant output , so that any expansion by an individual firm will not result in any significant movement along the output axis of the industry 's demand curve . If all firms expand , of course , there is naturally a perceptible movement along the industry 's output axis and the market price will fall . But for any firm in isolation , market price can be taken as determined by forces entirely outside its control . 3 . MARKET EQUILIBRIUM UNDER PERFECT COMPETITION The various strands can now be pulled together in order to see the full pattern of perfectly competitive equilibrium . It has been // established that each firm faces a perfectly elastic ( i.e. horizontal ) sales curve , such as that shown as DD ' in Fig. 28 , and that with such a sales curve average revenue and marginal revenue coincide . The condition for equilibrium in the industry is that average cost must equal average revenue , while for equilibrium of the firm marginal cost must equal marginal revenue . But average reyenue and mar ginal revenue coincide under perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruling output , average cost and marginal cost should both equal average revenue , or price , and must therefore be equal to one another It follows that the equili brium situation for each individual fir must be of the kind shown in Fig. 29 ( a ) ? output settling at that point where the sales curve is tangential to the average cost curve , and where the average cost curve is at its lowest point . The corresponding position for the in industry as a whole will be that shown in Fig. 29 ( b ) , where the scale of the output axis OX will of course be very much smaller than in Fig. 29 ( a ) . Output will settle at the point where the market demand curve DD ' intersects the minimum point of the industry 's long-run supply curve SS ' . Output will therefore be OM and price OP . Why should this rather special combination of features neces sarily be involved in the equilibrium position of each individual firm ? Consider it in two parts : first , why should output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second , why should the sales curve be a tangent to the average cost curve at that par ticular level of output ? The answer to the first question is that , as has been establisheduilibrium requires that both average and 1 66 Textbook of Economic Analysis marginal cost should equal price and therefore one another ; but with a normal U-shaped cost curve , marginal and average cost can be equal only at the lowest point of the average cost curve . So long as marginal cost is below average cost each extra unit of output is costing less than the average for output as a whole , and overall average cost must be falling . So long as marginal cost is above average cost , the average ( on the same kind of reasoning ) must be rising . When marginal cost equals average cost , the average must be neither rising nor falling ? i.e. it must have reached its lowest point and not yet started to rise again . Turn to the second question : why should the sales curve just touch the average cost curve at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The reason is that the equilibrium conditions require price ( average revenue , equal in this case to marginal revenue ) to be equal to both marginal and average cost . It is only at this point , where average and marginal cost are themselves equal , that the single price can be equal to both average and marginal cost . Hence it is only if the sales curve touches the average cost curve at this particular point that full equilibrium , of both firm and industry , can be attained . This can be seen if other cases are considered in which this special combination of requirements is not achieved . In Fig. 30 the horizontal sales curve is above the point of minimum cost . If the firm produces output OM1 it will itself be in equilibrium , because marginal cost equals marginal revenue at that point and its profits are maximised . But at that output its average revenue ( M1Q1 ) will be in excess of its average cost ( M1N1 ) and it will therefore be earning more than normal profits ; new firms will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that the industry will not be in equilibrium . ( As new firms come in , total supply will expand and the market price will fall , so that the individual firm 's sales curve will fall until it touches the average cost curve at its lowest point and profits are back to normal . ) Conversely , if it produced OM2 average cost and average revenue would be equal , profits would be normal and the industry would be in equilibrium . But the firm would not be maximising its profits ; at output OM2 the marginal cost of production ( M2Q2 ) would be in excess of the marginal revenue brought in ( M2N2 ) and the firm would be reducing its total profit with every unit it produced after OMI . Whatever other situation is postulated , then , either the industry or the firm will be in a state of disequilibrium , and price will con tinue to change . Only when price is equal to both marginal and ( minimum ) average cost will both the individual firm and the in industry as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this , of course , it is assumed that the forces of adjustment ? changes in out-put or the movement of firms ? are given time to work themselves out , although the analysis could easily be conducted in terms of short-run and long-run cost curves if it was desired to allow for the di erences introduced by the existence of time-lags . So a fundamental conclusion of the theory of value is arrived at : given conditions of perfect competition , the price of , a commodity tends to equality with its marginal cost of production . As has been seen , price will also be equal to the minimum average cost of production . If for any reason the equality of price and marginal cost is disturbed , forces will automatically be brought into play to restore if 1STeither demand nor supply can be said to have a dominant role in the deter mination of price , therefore ; price is the outcome of the interaction of demand and supply , each making a contribution of equal im portance : ) // Price under Monopoly 1 . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was discussed in which the number of competing producers of a commodity was so large that no single producer was able to exert a perceptible influence on the market price through variations in his output . Logically the opposite extreme of monopoly can be conceived of ? a situation in whicla single prodder controls the entire output of a certain commodity:Like the concept of perfect competition , monopoly is easier to define theoretically than to identify in practice . A great deal turns , as before , on the definition of a commodity , or of the extent of the break in the chain of substitutes which is required for a product to become a separate commodity rather than one of a number of types , or brands , of a commodity . In a sense , every producer has a monopoly of his own product provided there is even the smallest difference , actual or imaginary , between the goods he sells and those sold by his rivals ; on the other hand , the existence of monopoly could be denied altogether on the grounds that a substitute of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed it does . In economic analysis the use of the word monopoly lies between these two extremes . Each brand of chocolate , or motor-cars , or cigarettes , is not treated as a separate commodity , and therefore their producers are not treated as monopolists . On the other hand , a product such as coal is treated as a separate commodity even though gas and electricity and oil are to some degree substitutes ; hence the National Coal Board , having the sole right to produce and supply coal in Britain , is treated as a monopoly . Just as a flexible , common-sense attitude is adopted in deciding when a product is or is not a separate commodity , so a reasonable i68 // attitude is adopted towards the extent of control over total output required before a producer is regarded as a monopolist . To say that a firm does not have a monopoly because it produces only 95 per cent , and not r oo per c pat , of the total supply of a commodity would clearly be unrealistic Rather , a producer would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he controls such a large share of total output as to be able to exercise decisive control over the supply and price of the commodity through variations in his output : The essential point about monopoly , then , is that there ceases to be a distinction between the firm and the industry . A firm which has a monopoly position in any market is the industry so far as equilibrium analysis is concerned . By definition , no other producers can exert any perceptible influence on total supply or on price , whatever the level of profits enjoyed by the monopolist . So far as equilibrium is concerned , it is only the firm which requires analysis ; so long as the fix is in equilibrium , then of necessity the industry is in equilibrium 2 . SOURCES OF MONOPOLY POWER A firm ? or group of firms operating under some common direction ? may acquire and retain a dominant position in the market for a commodity by various means .. A common source of monopoly power in history has been the control of one or more factors of production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials may give an unchallengeable position to a firm in producing a commodity for which those raw materials are essential . In the long run , a position built up on this advantage is likely to be undermined by either the exhaustion of the deposits involved or the development of alternative natural or synthetic materials . A second important type of factor promoting a monopoly position is that of legal restriction on the entry of potential competitors into an industry . ' ' In Britain , for example , many fields of activity are closed to private firms , and the sole right of operation is conferred by statute on one enterprise ? the Central Electricity Board , National Coal Board and the General Post Office are familiar examples . More commonly , the law of patents can be invoked by a firm to secure the sole right of manufacture of a new product or use of a new process ? ' Finally , tariffs , or taxes on imports , may be used 1 70 Textbook of Economic Analysis to prevent foreign producers from competing with a domestic firm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a quantitative kind . Thirdly , competition may be prevented by financial factors . I Highly capitalistic industries , such as the manufacture of iron and  - -  steel , require enormous outlays on capital equipment before production can be carried out on the level necessary to compete with an established firm ; as a result , potential competitors may find it virtually impossible to enter the industry . In other industries , a firm may have acquired such goodwill in a market that new entrants could break into the market only through an expensive advertising campaign . Finally , a monopoly position may be built up through various devices specifically designed to prevent competition . An existing producer may deliberately sell a commodity at a loss in order to drive competitors with smaller reserves into bankruptcy A trade union may pursue a closed shop policy ? i.e. threaten strike action unless employment in a factory is confined to its members ? with exactly the same end in view . Until recent years , another common practice was for producers to form themselves into a trade association of one form or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , a mutinous entrepreneur might be brought to heel by a closing up of his channels of supply or of sales , since the association as a whole could threaten suppliers or retailers with a complete stoppage of orders or deliveries unless their measures were enforced . By the Restrictive Trade Practices Act of 1956 , however , such collective resale price maintenance ( as distinct from the enforcement of a recommended ' resale price by an individual producer acting alone ) was declared illegal in Britain . 3 . MONOPOLY EQUILIBRIUM Having seen how monopoly power may originate , it is necessary to consider what the exercise of that power may mean in terms of the equilibrium price and output in the market for a monopolist 's product . As was mentioned above , the analysis is relatively simple , since by definition the condition for equilibrium in the market as a whole becomes identical with the equilibrium condition for the // ( single ) firm . For the firm , equilibrium is attained when profits are maximised , and the possession of monopoly power makes no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the analysis by monopoly power is not that the requirements for equili brium are affected ; it is that there are no additional requirements which must be met for full equilibrium of the industry to be at tained , as there are under perfect competition . The rule is simply that the monopolist will maximise his profit , and the previous reasoning , by which it was established that profits are maximised when marginal cost and marginal revenue are equal , remains per fectly valid . Monopoly equilibrium , therefore , implies a situation such as that shown in Fig. 31 . As the monopolist supplies the whole market , the demand ( or average revenue ) curve facing him will be that for the commodity as a whole , and hence will usually be downwardsloping ; the distinction between sales curve and demand curve disappears . The monopolist will maximise his profit at that output which brings marginal revenue into equality with marginal cost ( OM ) in the diagram ) . Over and above the normal ' profit which is an element in the average cost curve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or monopoly , profits equal to the difference between average cost and price ( the area RSPQ in the diagram therefore represents the monopolist 's total excess profit ) . So far the argument has been conducted with reference to a single unified market throughout which the monopolist charges a single price . Precisely similar considerations apply to what is called a dis criminating monopoly ? that is , a situation in which a monopolist is able to break his market into two or more separate and isolated sec tions in which separate prices can be charged . A Harley Street specialist may charge two different fees for rendering an identical service to two different men , if he thinks one can afford to pay more // than the other ; firms have been known to sell at one price in the home market and a different price in the export market ; the British Electricity Boards supply a single product ? electricity ? at different prices to industrial users on the one hand and domestic consumers on the other . In such cases a monopolist seeking to maximise profits will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings the marginal revenue from each section into equality with the marginal cost of his total output . If the elasticity of demand for his product differs considerably between the different sections of his market , then the prices he will charge will also differ considerably , since the greater the elasticity of a demand curve the closer does marginal revenue come to price at any output . As was noted earlier , an elasticity of demand greater than unity means that total expenditure on the commodity increases as price falls , so that marginal revenue ( the change in total expenditure ) will be positive and may approach the level of the price itself . Elasticity below unity means that total expenditure falls as price decreases ; hence marginal revenue , being negative , is much below price . The monopolist will be producing only that output which makes marginal cost equal to marginal revenue , so that the more rapidly marginal revenue falls ( i.e. the less elastic the demand ) the smaller the monopolist 's output , and therefore the higher the market price . An example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the curves shown in Figs. 32 ( a ) and ( b ) represent the average and marginal revenue respectively in the monopolist 's two separate markets . The first is clearly a market with a small but inelastic demand , whereas in the second the demand is greater but more elastic . The curves TAR and TMR in Fig. 32 ( c ) represent the total average and marginal revenue from the two markets combined ; they are obtained , of course , by adding the curves in Figs. 32 ( a ) and ( b ) across horizontally . If the monopolist 's marginal cost is now plotted , its intersection with the total marginal revenue curve fixes his total output ? in this case 115 . At this output marginal cost is 5 , and he will therefore sell that quantity in each separate market which brings in a marginal revenue of ? 5 in each case . It will be seen that this means that he will sell 25 in the first market ( at a price of 12 ) and 90 in the second ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If his total output were anything other than 115 , marginal // cost and marginal revenue would not be equal and his profits could therefore not be maximised . If he divided his sales between the two markets in any other way , he would gain less additional revenue from the market in which sales increased than he would sacrifice in the market where sales diminished . This illustration of the important role which elasticity of demand plays in the allocation of sales between separate markets helps to bring out one of the two main features of the price and output policy of a monopolist . This is that a monopolist will never expand output beyond a point at which elasticity of demand falls close to unity . An elasticity of unity implies that total outlay is unaffected by a reduction in price , and this means that marginal revenue ( the change in total outlay ) is zero . Since the producer must incur some marginal cost by expanding output , his profits will be reduced if he has no additional revenue to offset marginal cost . Hence a monopolistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crops rather than sell them in a market . If the demand for the crop is inelastic , the sale in the market might result in a negative marginal revenue and thus profits would be bound to fall , even if the crops destroyed had no marginal cost whatever . The second main feature of monopoly equilibrium is that , in comparison with perfect competition , price will usually be higher and output will usually be lower . Under perfect competition , as the last chapter showed , output will settle at that point where price is equal to marginal cost . The monopolist produces that output at which marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost . As the demand 174 Textbook of Economic Analysis curve for any normal commodity is downward-sloping , marginal revenue will always be to the left of average revenue , or price ( i.e. at any output marginal revenue will always be lower than price ) . It follows , then , that the marginal revenue curve will cut the marginal cost curve to the left of the point at which the price curve cuts it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The monopolist makes his ex-cess profits , in other words , by holding down output and holding up price , and he is not prevented from doing this ( as he would be under perfect competition ) by a movement of firms into the industry under the attraction of the abnormally high level of profits prevailing there . An illustration of this is provided by Fig. 33 , where the market demand curve is given by AR and the corresponding marginal revenue curve is MR . If the industry is a perfectly competitive one , the curve SS ' can be taken to represent its long-run supply curve . The analysis of the previous chapter has established that equilibrium will be achieved when the industry is operating at the point of minimum average cost , where price equals marginal cost . Hence output will be OM and price OP . If the industry consists of a single monopolist , however , SS ' be-comes his average cost curve and his output will be determined by his marginal cost curve MC . Where this intersects the marginal revenue curve , his profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sole objective , this will be his equilibrium point . Hence the monopolist 's output in this case will be OM ' ( lower than the competitive output ) and his price will be OP ' ( higher than the competitive price ) . Two qualifications must immediately be made to this conclusion , however . First , it rests on the assumption that the level of costs is the same under monopoly and under competition . This may not be // so . A monopolist , by concentrating production under single control , may gain considerable economies of large-scale production . As a result , the monopolist 's marginal cost curve may be considerably lower than that prevailing under competition , so that price may be lower and output higher under monopoly , despite the presence of excess monopoly profits . This is not so improbable as might be thought at first sight . In the supply of gas or electricity , for example , the market is usually a limited geographical area ; frequently one modern generating plant can easily supply the entire market . It would obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were served by rival generators , with rival pipes and cables in the same streets , all operating at much below their full capacity . The same is true of railway systems ; the idea of duplicating expensive permanent ways and operating staff has only to be considered to be seen to be absurdly wasteful . Monopoly and excessively high prices , therefore , are by no means synonymous . The second qualification is that when monopoly is compared unfavorably with competition , it is perfect competition with which the comparison is being made , and perfect competition seldom , if ever , exists in reality . The more appropriate comparison in reality is between monopoly and the imperfect form of competition which is usually the practical alternative . As will be found in the next chapter , imperfect competition frequently involves a good deal of waste and inefficiency ( especially in matters such as product differentiation and competitive advertisement ) which might not be experienced with a monopoly . This strengthens the possibility , then , that monopoly costs ( including selling as well as production costs ) may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced . r - Nevertheless , the fact remains that the existence of monopoly power ( whether in the form of pure monopoly or as an element in the half-competitive , half-monopolistic world examined in the next chapter ) has a restrictive effect on output , tending to result in higher prices to the consumer and higher profits for the producer than would otherwise prevail . : This is particularly the case when demand is relatively inelastic , so that marginal revenue falls rapidly ; the steeper the demand curve , the further to the left will be the point at which the marginal cost and revenue curves intersect ; this // means that a monopolist 's output would be smaller , and his price higher , than would be the case under competition despite a substantial reduction of cost which might be secured through the monopoly organisation . Hence the problem of monopoly policy can not be ignored in an economy where monopolistic elements exist to any significant degree . 4 . MONOPOLY AND PUBLIC POLICY There has been a growing realisation during the present century of the dangers of monopoly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through restricted output and high prices , and the undue concentration of economic power in a small number of private individuals , which may result from a monopoly position . There can be little doubt that these dangers are real , although it must be remembered that the analysis of monopolistic prices rests ( as always in economic theory ) on the assumption that entrepreneurs invariably act so as to maximise their profits . If this assumption does not hold ? and this may frequently be the case in reality ? then the conclusion that price will usually be higher under monopoly than under competition will have to be qualified . Assuming , however , that other things being equal a monopolist does usually seek to maximise his profits , how can the exercise of monopolistic power , harmful as it is to the consumer , be restricted ? In the first place , the monopolist 's power is always limited by the existence of substitutes , to which consumers may turn if prices are set too high . In other words , substitutes will increase the elasticity of the demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen that the gap between monopoly price and competitive price will always be smaller the greater is the elasticity of demand . Even if no close substitutes are produced in the same country , a monopolist must always be careful to keep his price below the point at which it is possible to import similar products from abroad and market them at a competitive price . Secondly , a monopolist may not charge the high price which maximises his profit for fear of stimulating rival producers to enter his market in order to share in his high profit . A monopoly position resting , for example , on the high costs of entry into the industry may be only a qualified one ; competitors may not be prepared to // incur the high costs of setting up in the industry so long as the rate of profit in it is only a little above the normal level , but they may reconsider their judgement if the profits being earned by the monopolist become very high indeed and present a strong temptation . Thirdly , a monopolist may be content to earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the hope of extending the market and so increasing his long-run profits . He may deliberately hold down the price of his product in the belief that , by accepting lower profits in the short run , the growth of the demand for his product will be encouraged ; a relatively low rate of profit on a large output in the long run may attract him more than a high rate of profit on the small output indicated by existing demand conditions . For all these reasons , then , the existence of monopoly powers can not necessarily be taken to imply the full exercise of these powers . In many cases , the loss suffered by the consumer as the result of a moderate use of monopoly power may be more than offset by the gain he enjoys because of the lower costs ? production and selling costs ? brought about by the concentration of output in a single enterprise , or a small group of enterprises operating in association with one another . Nevertheless , in many ? and probably most ? cases the consumer suffers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite all these qualifications and limitations of the monopolist 's power . When the abuses of monopoly become substantial , it may be thought that only intervention on the part of the government can ensure adequate protection for the consumer . Such intervention may take the form of a complete transfer of the control of an industry out of private hands , or at least a direct control over the industry 's price and output policy . For example , the relatively high capital costs incurred in the production and supply of gas and electricity made it inevitable , from an early stage in the history of these industries in Britain , that a single producer would operate on a monopolistic basis in each area . The wastes involved in duplicating or triplicating gas works and pipe systems in an area which could be adequately served by a single producer ( and which would have to be served by a single producer if the potential economies of large-scale output were to be realised ) , would be obvious to even // the bitterest opponent of monopoly . Hence , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local government authorities themselves or was conducted by private corporations having the sole right of operation in each area but restricted fairly severely in their powers to raise prices or to increase their profits . Subsequently , of course , the economies gained from a consolidation of the industries into single units operating on a nation-wide basis have been thought sufficient to justify their nationalisation . For similar reasons , in most countries postal services are provided by an agency of the government itself . The operation of an industry by a government or some semigovernmental body , however , is not always considered a desirable development ; this may be because of political considerations , or because of technical reasons which suggest that a particular industry is not conducive to efficient management by an official body . In such cases , other means of restraining or eliminating monopoly powers have to be adopted . Practice varies widely from country to country in this respect . In the United States , for example , a vigorous anti-monopoly campaign has been conducted for many years through the processes of the law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are considered to be means of securing monopoly power , have been declared by statute to be illegal , and an energetic branch of the government has been charged with the discovery and prosecution of breaches of the law . Although it is impossible to measure the degree of success enjoyed by measures of this kind ( after all , even the extent of monopoly itself can not be measured , let alone the influence of public policy upon it ) it seems likely that it has exercised a salutary effect in discouraging producers from trying to build up monopoly positions . In Great Britain the attitude towards monopoly has been rather different until recent years , the tendency being to avoid general condemnation of particular practices or forms of organisation . The reason for this has been partly the belief that there are few legal restrictions which a competent company lawyer can not invent some means of surmounting , but mainly the conviction that practices which may be undesirable in some cases may be perfectly defensible in others . It had been thought better to consider each industry separately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad hoc basis . // A significant departure from this policy occurred in 1948 with the establishment of a Monopolies Commission charged with the consideration of practices and policies being pursued in industries referred to it for examination by the Board of Trade . In its reports after each investigation , the Commission was required to indicate practices which it considered to be contrary to the public interest , and the government were given powers to declare such practices to be illegal . A far-reaching development of this policy occurred in 1956 with the passage of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act , under which various practices of a monopolistic nature were declared to be illegal unless firms adopting them could satisfy a Restrictive Practices Court that they are not contrary to the public interest in their particular case . Each industry has to register these designated practices within a specified time with a Registrar appointed for the purpose and to either obtain approval of them from the Court or abandon them within that specified period . It is exceedingly difficult , and in any case probably too soon , to judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , that its degree of success will depend heavily on the extent to which the existence of this legal machinery and examination induces the general body of entrepreneurs to abandon monopolistic practices ( or abstain from their adoption ) , rather than on the number of successful prosecutions conducted with its aid .
