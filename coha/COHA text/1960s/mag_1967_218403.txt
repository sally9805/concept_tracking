French shoppers are inveterate food feelers-they pinch tomatoes , squeeze head lettuce , pull artichoke leaves , even give cheese a little poke before stashing it in their shopping sacks . Michel Turquet , 46 , a former supermarket manager with a technocratic bent , hopes to change all that . If he gets his way , francs will come before fondles . <P> <P> Turquet owns Super-March de Poche , Paris ' first computerized grocery store , which in the space-starved city sells 1,700 articles in its 240-sq. - ft. display area . A customer is given a plastic envelope and directed to the shelf space , which bears one sample of each product , plus a pile of punch cards . As he shops , he selects white cards for spices , blue for canned goods , red for dairy products , and so on . Finally he gives the cards to an operator who feeds them to a computer ; in seconds the machine spews out a list of the items , prices and a total . Minutes later , a clerk appears from the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection that a list of 50 or more goods takes only a few minutes . And with only three assistants , Turquet can handle 30 people at a time during rush hours without creating bottlenecks . <P> While unfamiliar to Americans , computerized shopping is not completely new in Europe . It has been tried without notable success by smallish markets in Normandy and Sweden , and at least one big Swedish food chain has rejected electronic shopping . " Our customers would n't enjoy running around collecting cards instead of merchandise , " says Paul Brundin of Gothenburg 's Turitz &; Co . " Shopping should be fun . " <P> After a month of operation , Turquet believes that his pristine store , where the whir of a Bull-GE TAS-84 computer has replaced the clang of pushcarts and the monotony of canned music , is a going concern . His profit margin is 15% , his stock turns over every two weeks , and , says he , " the 2% other supermarkets have to deduct in theft losses ev ery month pays my rental fee for the computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
