As mountains go , Antarctica 's Vinson Massif* is not particularly awe-inspiring in its height . A humpbacked hunk of granite that rises to 16,860 ft. , Vinson is the highest known peak on the continent , but it is still lower than ten mountains in North America . For an accomplished alpinist , the hike to the summit would seem like a Sunday stroll - if only it were n't for a couple of complications . <P> First , Vinson lies 400 miles due east of remote Byrd Station , and only 600 miles from the South Pole . Second , Antarctica is racked by fierce ( up to 90 m.p.h. ) gales and covered with ice up to 14,000 ft. thick ; the temperature , even in the middle of summer , can drop to - 40 . Add to that the fact that no man had ever before set foot on the slopes of Vinson-and the laconic announcement from the U.S. Navy base at McMurdo Sound had to qualify as a masterpiece of understatement : " A U.S. climbing party planted the flags of twelve nations on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on Dec. 21 , 1966 . " <P> Complete Isolation . The logistics alone made it an impressive feat . Commanded by Los Angeles Lawyer Nicholas Clinch , 36 , a veteran of two Himalayan ascents , the ten members of the U.S. expedition had nothing to go on except aerial photographs in planning their assault , had to do without fancy climbing rigs . And they had to prepare themselves mentally for one of the loneliest undertakings man has ever attempted . Explained Clinch before the climb : " Antarctica is not like the Himalayas , where you can always retreat to a native village if something goes wrong . " From the moment that a Navy plane deposited them on a lifeless plateau 20 miles from the base of the Vinson Massif , the climbers ' only lifeline to the outside world was an emergency radio hookup with McMurdo Sound , 1,300 miles away . Their sole comfort was that nobody needed to be afraid of the dark . In December , the sun shines 24 hours a day . <P> Not until the climbers return to civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that may be quite a while . Last week Leader Clinch informed McMurdo Sound that the expedition was shifting its attention to Mount Tyree-at 16,290 ft. , the second highest peak in Antarctica . <P> <P> * Named after former U.S. Congressman Carl Vinson , longtime chairman of the House Armed Services Committee .
