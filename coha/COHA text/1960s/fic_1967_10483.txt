of which Flicker Hamden would be contemptuous not because it represented privilege , gentility , and bigotry but because it was  --  to use his word  --  creaky : few of the houses even had television masts . Tom felt argumentative . He was a mender of suffering human beings , an old-fashioned gut man ; this ever-talking futurist made him feel a little dizzy on the brink of obsolescence . He wanted to get something back . " See how the current takes us , " he said at the ' West Chop bell , where the weird sliding of the sea was most visible . " It would be murder against it "  --  justifying yesterday 's painful layover if not the trip for the rain gear . Flicker went right on , however , his bland , expressionless face opening at the mouth to let out a ceaseless flow of buoyant , null , enthusiastic , insensitive explosions . But near the northern end of Middle Ground , where the black can buoy was almost pulled right under by the rushing current , Harmony hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in diminishing puffs , but enough to make the yawl jump and shudder . At the first lurch Tom saw a moment 's shadow , no more than a tern 's wing 's worth , cross Flick 's open face , and Flick blurted out  --  the thought given tongue before his slow inner censor could do anything more than dampen the tone and erase the question mark at the end , " I suppose this fat thing is pretty good in a seaway . " That she was . Tom did nothing with the opening Flick had given him to say what he felt , and what he knew , about the qualities of " this fat thing , " Harmony ; about how the shrewd Maine fishermen had designed their boats to be sailed out to make a hard living in all four seasons , under huge sails in light airs in summer yet also able in winter  --  what men !  --  to come thrashing back in from offshore banks in the teeth ofp41whistling sub-zero nor'westers . So they had thought of stability , of making their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the elements , yet they had thought of footing along , too , to get to market ahead of the others , for dollars ' sakes . Hard bilges , flaring sides , great flanks and hips  --  power , probity , and that strength of character in boats known as weatherliness . What a mockery yacht-racing rules had made of sound design ! Men 's lives , not their vanities , were designed into the Maine boats . But all Tom said was , " You 'll see , she 's solid as a stone house . " Later , beyond the rip , out in the Sound abreast of oaktuftedislands , Nonamesset and Vekatimmest and long Naushon , as it became evident even to Flick that the land breeze was dropping out , the puffs having less body and the intervals growing warm and breathless , an inevitable question came about the engine down below . Tom was not surprised ; he had guessed that this hard-talking bundle of wires would not be able to stand slatting sails in a dead calm , for he would want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relished being free with his answer . Oh , yes , he cared about having a power plant you could depend on . Harmony secreted a two-year-old four-cylinder Gray which took her along at six knots in flat water . Which would start at the touch of a button , guaranteed . Had just changed the coil , the plugs , the points , the condenser . Said he did this three times a summer , needed or no  --  corrosion by salt moisture in one of those spots was the cause of ninetenthsof the heart failure on yachts . Talking this way , Dr. Meticulous felt the edge of his own smugness . " I hate to use the kicker , " he said , " except when it 's really needed . " He saw Flick chew that ; you could easily read the code of this guy inp42the involuntary labors of his jaw muscles , for he seemed to eat tough thoughts and bad feelings raw . " There 's no hurry today , " Tom said . " Look how we 're moving on the land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had worked the issue of the current for all it would give ; so he shot one right past Flick to Audrey . " What would you think of ducking into Tarpaulin Cove  --  or Quicks 's Hole would be even better  --  and anchoring for a swim and lunch ? It 'll be nice and hot in an hour from now ; this is pooping out . Then when the afternoon sou'wester comes in , we can scoot across to Menemsha . " It was Dottie who reacted first to this idea . " Yes , let 's , " she said , leaning forward as if dizzy with fervency and putting out one hand to steady herself on the binnacle hood . There would be a hand stain on the brass : salt and oil from the flesh . Tom would have to wipe it away that evening , with a rag and some Noxon ; a prick of annoyance spurred his surprise at the eagerness of Dot 's response . Audrey came in fast with a seconding ; she urged Quicks Hole . Tom , looking aloft to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands , was suddenly thoughtful about the sun glints he had seen in both girls ' eyes just now . Some sort of kindling had been laid out unbeknownst to him ; he did n't want to be a dumb bunny ; he must keep sharp . The last of the breeze , wavering in direction so that Tom could take good advantage of the shifts as he short-tacked on the favorable current into the gut between Pasque and Nashawena , barely had the weight to cut Harmony out of the swift tidal stream running through the Hole and to take her up to the empty curve of dunes and bright shallow-shelving beach on the southwest side . They were lucky ; there were onlyp43a couple of power boats anchored in the bight . Tom slipped Harmony closer toward the beach than the power cruisers and swung north away from them and casting off sheets lulled up until she was dead in the glassy water ; he called forward to Flick to heave the anchor . Splash ! Sails down . There they were . A deserted place under a still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tying stops and coiling lines , all four on the yawl stood wherever they were and stared in silence at the empty place : sand , rocks , grass , water , and a huge blue sky for white gulls to write on . But for the horrible stinkpots ( those two cruisers simply had to be put out of mind ) this was away , away ; four human souls in a wild place . And a wildness seemed to be rooted in three of them . Flicker suggested daiquiris , wanted to know where the rum lived  --  did they have any limes ? Tom said he never drank on Harmony until the evening anchor was down ; but go ahead . All three of those others skinned down the companionway to squeeze lemons ( no limes ) and crack ice and change into swim suits . And soon they were in the cockpit  --  both girls in bikinis . Audrey had had a Cote d'Azur bikini for two years , which she had never had the nerve to put on , but all things were easy in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice chest ; they were fogged now briefly with cold as the pale drinks gurgled from a silver spout . Audrey produced picnic eggs . White grains flew from a tiny cardboard saltcellar ; teeth glistened biting into the yolks . The sunbaked boat lay on a plastic bay . There seemed to be much traffic into the cabin and back out to the sun  --  more rum , something cheesy to munch on ; limbs grazing , bare flanks brushing against each other in passage up and down the companionway , breathless laughter , casual hand play ( wipingp44away a splash of daiquiri , patting on sun oil , caressing home a talking point )  --  Flick 's palms in joke and the girls ' own fingers in self-loving pleasure flowing over the long stretches of warm skin between the kerchiefs at the loins and the kerchiefs at the breasts . All was indiscriminate . They dived , dried off , drank , ate , licked lips , touched each other as if by accident . Tom was set off to one side by his own prudence , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others : heat , the salt on the skin , the rum in the veins , the stretch of golden days leading across blue water toward nowhere , nowhere . Dot 's bikini was so trivial that the rippling reflection of lights on the water gave a tremulous glow to the undercurve of her abdomen as she stood outside the lifelines , one hand reaching down to steady herself while she waited to dive , her knees bent and spread apart as if she were overcome with lust , and when a few moments later she climbed up the swimming ladder the skimpy dark blue cloth below had been pulled down by her plunge so that circlets of hair showed and pearls of seawater glistened in the creases between her thighs and the now wetted roundness of her belly . Tom saw a bald man on the nearer power boat shamelessly looking across through a pair of binoculars . Sun oil was getting on the teak of Harmony , but for once Tom did not care . Flick bellowed like a moose ; Dot raised her arms , a post-impressionist 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Audrey 's eyes were vague , and Tom thought of a Yeats phrase : " dream-dimmed . " They unshipped the dinghy and they rowed , several hands on each oar , hilariously catching crabs with the blades , to the curve of sand , and they baked themselves till they had to wash off and hurry back , those three , for thirds and fourths from the silver shaker . Tom drifted with their sensuality . Every moment wasp45sun-warmed , invitations and temptations flew out in ease and heat , glands must have been giving freely of their lubricants . What loose laughter ! In the midst of this Tom realized that he had not listened to a single weather report all day . He scrambled down into the cabin as if shot out of a gun and turned on the radio and got the Ronettes singing " Walkingin the Rain . " At once there was motion against the sky in the companionway : Flicker luring Audrey into doing some kind of rock-and-roll chugging thing . The big man pretended he had to duck to avoid the boom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three laughed loud , himself the loudest , at his jack-in-the-box motions . Tom turned the button in search of another station , and at the cutting off of the music boos and groans came down the steps from the others . It was the wrong phase of the hour ; no news was on . Tom snapped off the set . Audrey leaned her flushed face into the opening and called down , " Ah , come on , Tommy , that was pretty music . " " Have a heart , " Tom said . " It 's on dry cells  --  it 's for weather reports . " Audrey looked at Tom for a moment as if he were a total stranger and said , " Good God , Dr. Medlar , you have a whole inventory of spare batteries down there under the seat . Have n't you ? " How could he say that it was the principle of the thing ? That that device was what Flicker wanted more of on this " fat thing "  --  a predictor . She was tight and Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wrong . Perhaps , besides , he was in the wrong , and he was choked by that thought and climbed above . The mood of those three shaded off after that , and fifteenp46minutes later Audrey and Flicker were below , stretched out on the padded settees on opposite sides of the cabin , sound asleep , and Dot , her body all pink in her two bits of cloth , had sprawled into a limb-flung sleep on the canvas cushions on the cockpit seat . Tom sat near the other man 's nearly nude wife waiting for the wind . The bald gent on the power boat , with his binoculars slung on his neck at the ready , was smoking a huge cigar . Gulls were crying in circles above the lily pond beyond the dunes . Tom felt rueful . He knew that it would have been the very top of folly to drink in mid-passage , especially now that it was clear he would have to sail single-handed over to Menemsha . Drunk skippers wreck boats . But he thought of the skins grazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome abandon , and of the undecipherable dreams clinging like pale-colored lenses to Aud 's eyes , and of Dot 's pathetic yet touching eagerness to give , to do , to be whatever was wanted . Tom keenly felt his separateness from the others . Dot stirred and sighed ; he stood up . He saw a piece of bread left on top of the cabin trunk , and he began to break it up and to toss bits into the clear water . The gulls , alert at a great distance to this opportunity and suddenly muted by greed , banked and glided down to swoop and snatch at the floating food . One was a bully . Tom , furious at its cutting-out tactics , threw his coke bottle at it , but it flew safely away with leisurely strokes of its rain-cleaned wings . Then out across the open Sound Tom saw what seemed to be magic shadows on the water fallen down from a cloudlesssky  --  the first streaks of the sea breeze , breaking the quicksilverglaze of the dead calm that had come with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dark on thep47wide , steaming mirror . Tom went to work , to be ready when the afternoon breeze had gathered enough body to reach along the island surfaces and come down into the bay of the Hole . First the little spanker went up ; then the main . He waited a bit . The metal wind vane at the main truck wavered , then turned with some purpose toward the southwest ; the sail trembled up at the head . Yes , air was moving in  --  air that had come like instinct-driven migrating wildlife from far shores , from Hatteras , Dry Tortugas , Yucatan . Tom thought in a flash of Esme , out there somewhere to the southwest , and for a moment he was furious with himself for his laxity in not having listened to a forecast all day . But then he busied himself  --  got the anchor up and shipped it and coiled the line and lashed the Danforth 's triangular blades and long cross bar into its cradle abaft the mast , and quickly hauled up the jib and ran aft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Harmony the wrong way . No matter ; a puff came and filled the sails and Tom gibed her comfortably around to glide out toward the Sound . The crew slept . How serene to be alone on a well-loved boat on an easy beam reach in smooth water ! Tom felt alone , and now , busy at the helm , he accepted solitude and began to think it a blessing . He headed for the lowest point in the great dip of the skyline of Martha 's Vineyard between Chilmark and Gay Head , holding half a point to windward of what he took to be Menemsha itself , to allow for the current which was now just beginning to run up the Sound . This was the perfect angle of sailing for Harmony , a hair higher than wind abeam , heelingp48at a lazy slant , rushing along with a swishing sound through the ripples as myriad maps of foam floated past a daydreaming geographer at the wheel , islets and reefs and atolls and shoals of spindrift thrown out by the creative bow waves . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would hold her course without his hands on the spokes of the wheel . B ) . the time Harmony was half way across the Sound  --  the wind holding so light as scarcely to ruffle the water , which was now moving more surely in the same direction as the air  --  Tom had thoroughly lost himself in the wide afternoon . His gaze was making a casual sweep of all those things that bear watching  --  the lull of the tall sail , the telltales , the cleating of lines , the carelessly dropped fall of the main sheet , a winch handle not stowed  --  when he became distantly aware of a glittering pair of eyes aimed at him . He came back with an inner crash to his company : Dot , across from him , sleeppuffed , lazy , stretching her drowsy nakedness , and looking at him . Tom met her eyes , and he saw the most blatant and pathetic invitation deep , deep in the blue irises . It was so urgent as to be a cry for help . It said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , we 're alone , they 're asleep down there . Help me ! Change me ! Tom 's heart began to run . How easy it would be to untie the little bow at the hip ! The oiled legs were already spread . Harmony would sail herself . Enter , possess , serve , and never regret . Either to break the spell of those pleading eyes , or simply to figure the risks , Tom stood up and stepped to the companionway and looked down into the cabin . Two enchantedsleepers lay on the berths , in thrall to the narcotic gurgling of the boat 's motion , dead to the betrayals of this world.  |p49Harmony  held her course like a good friend . Tom stood over Dot , looking down at her . Her gaze , still pouring into his face , seemed to Tom to say so very much about Flicker Hamden . Tom 's own warmth , withdrawn in the role of mere witness in the hour at anchor , now began to bank up fiercely , yet at least part of what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the verge of bending down and reaching out a hand to Dot 's cheek when she began to shiver . His eye slid to her skin , so desirable and so available a few moments ago , and he saw there countless tiny gathers . Goose pimples . She was chilled by the ocean breeze . That begging look ! Her eyes must have been pleading for cover not by a man , not by him of all men , but simply by cloth , warm cloth . He was horrified by his misreading of her messages . His face began to burn . He turned rapidly and descended the companionway ladder and went forward between the sleepers  --  Hamden was snoring in a sleep of filthy righteousness  --  to the forward cabin , where he tore a blanket off one of the bunks , and he carried it back up on deck and spread it over Dottie . She turned her eyes up to his with a look of luxuriating gratitude , as if he had indeed served her and unknotted her , and the lids of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head  --  and she was fast asleep again , eased away by his gift of warmth . Tom sat down at the wheel , all alone again . He felt a slow anger rising , but it was not strong . The genny needed trimming ; he slipped the handle into the leeward jib sheet winch ,  |p50not  far from Dot 's form , and casting off the cleated fall took a few fast cranks . The rachets clicked their peremptory sounds into the hull . " What 's happening ? " It was Audrey , from below . Tom was surprised by his sharp elation , relief , at hearing that steady , good-natured voice . " You 're missing a hell of a sail . That 's what , " he called . Dot d1d not move . Tom went forward to the companionway once more and looked below and saw his wife lying on her back , a sweater spread on her , staring straight upward , her eyes unusually wide and dark . " Come on up and join me , " he said softly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , darling , " Aud said . She made mouth motions , indicating a drink-dry tongue . " Twenty more winks , O.K. ? " But she did not come . She may have fallen asleep again , Tom supposed , and he sailed on in a breeze that was now folding little tucks in the water . He had to point higher , as the current was running more swiftly , and he hardened up all three sails , coiling the main sheet when he had trimmed it down . The sun was on the shoulder of the afternoon , and a haze hung on the air like a vague report ; a mildewy dampness that rumored of immense depths of the sea far away off soundings . He realized that he himself felt chilled , but for some reason he did not want to go below to fetch himself a windbreaker . Half a mile from the Menemsha bell Tom began to rouse the crew . " You 've got to see this entrance , " he shouted down into the cabin . " Be right up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flicker.  |p51Audrey  was awake , too , uncovered in her bikini . Tom had the impression he had interrupted a lazy conversation , perhapsabout himself , between those two ; they were lying on their sides facing each other across the cabin . He turned and shook Dot 's blanket-covered shoulder untilshe awoke in the act of stretching , mouth pulled , one bare arm reaching out . He pointed to the bluffs of Chilmark , where the scrub oaks were lighted yellow-green by the lowering sun , and she sat up making sleepy sounds of delight ; she pulled the blanket he had brought her close around herself and hugged herself in it . Flicker climbed up with a rowing shirt over his trunks , and in a few minutes Aud appeared in blue cotton slacks and a pale yellow sweater . Near the bell , which clanged seldom in the calm sea , they handed the sails ; Flick helped Audrey furl the main . Dot sat huddled and passive in the blanket . All three were amazingly fresh-eyed and observant , pointing out sights for others to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Now hear this . " He pressed a button , the starter gave out a gong-like cry , and the engine did indeed respond at once . " Music , " Flicker said , but with less admiration in his voice than Tom would have liked to hear . Tom headed for the mouth of the jetties . The tidal current was running out so fast from the broad reserves of Menemsha Pond that between the jetties waves of the water 's swiftness were veed together as if this were a river descending from hills , and Harmony , swaying and straining , barely moved against all that force alongside the great angular chunks ofp52stone . Bathers from the beach to the left , two women in floppy hats , and some boys with a barking golden Labrador stood on the breakwater watching their entrance . At the end of the left-hand jetty Tom swung his boat sharply to port into the basin , where , in still water , Harmony seemed to shoot forward . Quickly picking an anchorage between two fiberglas cutters , Tom swung in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finally called to Flick to heave the anchor . A man on-bne of the glass boats made a circle of a thumb and forefinger and called across , " Very pretty ! " Did he mean anchoring on a single pass like that , with plenty of room all around , or did he mean Harmony herself ? Tom , walking forward on the deck , glowed with sunburn and windburn and pleasure . Flick and Audrey were on the foredeck , looking at a whirlwind of gulls over the dunes beyond the Creek . Tom spent some time checking the hold of the hook because he had dragged once here on thick kelp on the bottom ; the other two moved aft . Straightening up , looking around at the whited Coast Guard boathouse with its launching rails slanting down into the smooth basin , at Dutcher 's Dock with two raunchy commercialswordfishermen tied up alongside , at the sportsmen 's playland of flying bridges two and three deep at the outer end of the town quay  --  at this quaint place so sophisticated that the tourist touches had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Tom felt a current of release ; he was pleasantly tired , full to the brim with a day of sailing delights , ready now to unbend with the others . He wanted a drink with the others , wanted to redress his stiffness of the noon hour and to commune with them in that spirit of mindlessness they had achieved , that **25;7830;TOOLONG reveling in the dumb works of fingertips , tongues , lips , eyes , limbs , hot skins  --  but it seemed that during his securing of Harmony a vote had been taken by those three beyond his earshot to go ashore first , before cocktails , to take possession of the place by planting feet on it ; they were not really sailors , any of them , not even Aud . He felt he owed Dot a debt  --  not an explanation , because she surely had no inkling of what had gone through his mind , and she may not even have been fully awake . He wanted to be agreeable ; he wanted to laugh with Dot 's husband Flick . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dinghy , holding it steady while the girls and Flick got in , and he rowed them ashore . The lights of evening bathed Menemsha , and Tom took them into the simple shack of the fishmarket on the dock , where in a glass-sided tank great lobsters , like knights in the jousting ready-tent , faced death with stupid calm , and bluefish and mackerel and striped bass , already staring with the knowledge of what death brings , lay on cracked ice  --  still lifes with glints of irridescent silver , blue , aqua , and pale , pale gray of shadows under rocks in shallows . Tom ordered up some clams , and a college boy , working there to get away from his family 's middle-class ethos , in boots and dirty sweatshirt and jeans , hair too long , upper lip surly and spoiled , pried open a dozen and a half , wincing each time he squeezed the steel wedge , and having cut the white muscles laid the clams in their dripping halfshells on a round metal tray . They ate them right there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rims of the shells ; Flicker made slurping noises . The damp cementp54floor , the deep bump-clack of the ice room door thrown shut , the sunset light , the edged saline taste of the clams  --  Tom savored , if more inwardly than those three at noon , a rush of unthinking sensations . But now it seemed the others did not want to let themselvesgo . Tom was out of phase again . Audrey spilled a dribble of clam juice down her chin and onto her yellow sweater , and her embarrassment and annoyance were too large for the case ; fire spread on her cheeks . Dot ate one clam and made a face . Flick began talking about the city in homesick gloom : how he had walked across Fifty-seventh Street at eight o'clock one Sunday morning , with not a living soul in sight  --  a sciencefictionfeeling of being the only survivor . He was , Tom suddenlythought , trying to think them away from this room with a redolence of the substitute for the odor of sex  --  the smell , among others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked with burning eyes , " And what were you doing walking the streets at that hour on a Sunday ? " Flick patted her on the shoulder and said as if to a small child , " Hrrumph . Your Uncle Fillmore do n't let no grass grow under his footsies . " Tom could n't believe the charge for the clams . He had had them in other summers from that same battered circular tray for what ?  --  three cents a clam ? He thought the college boy , a product of the new math , had perhaps never learned simple addition ; he pressed his questions ; the boy barked the name of his boss , who came from the chilly caverns beyond the thick door in a fishing cap with a long black plastic visor and confirmed the robbery , to the penny , in very sour New England tones that seemed to say , " Dear Lord , spare us fromp55these summer people . " Tom wound up bilked and humiliated . There was too much money around .. . But then rescue came  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swordfishermen , a high-pulpited vessel painted a strange brown of deserts , of dust , of utter dryness , named Thalia IV , with the pennant of a catch on the ratlines of her crow 's nest . All hurried out on the dock . A huge , muscular , steel-blue torso was heaved out on a crane and was weighed and was dumped on the dock , and the man in the blackvisoredcap settled a price with the fishermen . A seagull with an eye brimming with defiance perched on the torso by the rip where the sword-nosed head had been severed and began pecking at the pinkness . No one drove it away . Tom took his lackluster crew , their three set against his one , back out to Harmony for drinks . They were soon settled , glasses in hand , in the cockpit in a quiet frame of mind as the circle of the sun seemed drawn down by an attraction of brilliance to brightness toward the piercing flashes of the Buzzards Bay light , already lit , on the Texas tower over the open sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his isolation , was slipping farther into it . Flick said , " Hey , case the haunted pirate ship . " There had appeared between the jetties a big lumbering trimeran being pushed slowly by an inadequate , whining outboard . It blundered into the basin , its high freeboard and three massive floats clearly making it difficult to maneuver in a crowded , windy anchorage . A corpulent young man with ap56purple face under a Bahama straw was at the tiller , and he looked furious that his craft , with which he had evidently determined to impress yachtsmen from Maine to Florida , had proved so awkward , and in its clumsiness so very unnautical . A pretty , soft woman  --  Flicker let out a low wolf whistle at the sight of her  --  wearing pajama-like slacks and dark glasses with mirroring lenses , was drooped over the anchor line forward in what appeared to be the last stages of exhaustion and vexation ; she looked around with eyes that seemed , in their reflecting , to be ovals of just what she saw . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , though his ugly , gigantic duck was still moving . She slipped the anchor line , holding her hands up in a feminine gesture of distaste away from the snaking coils of Nylon . When the line went limp she made it fast . Flick said , " Listen to the way that snotty son of a bitch talks to her . " " That marriage wo n't last long , " Dottie said in a dry voice . Flick 's face snapped around toward his wife 's ; he gulped at his drink as if to wash down the reaction that had started up his gorge . The wind carried the trimeran , settling on its anchor line , hard down on one of the glass boats , and it was clear that the fellow was going to have to try again . He had overconfidently cut his engine ; he scrambled out on the after-frame to start it up once more . Flick snorted . The trimeran man 's purple face lifted up and he roared to his wife to get the God-damn hook up ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at heaven and became heavens . The soft arms tugged . " The bastard , " Flick said.  |p57The  outboard was racing in neutral , throwing out smelly fumes . " Is it up ? Is it up ? " The anchor was obviously off the bottom , for the bulky triple pontoons had begun to drift . " God damn it ! Get it up ! " The woman nodded . Was she weeping behind her mirrors ? The man took the nod for a signal that all was clear , though the anchor line still hung down straight . He threw the motor into forward gear . The big craft began to creep into the wind . " Incompetent meathead , " Flick said , and then he emptiedhis drink , holding the glass back with the ice against his teeth while the last drops trickled down his throat . Tom looked at Audrey ; he felt he had to see her face . Was she disturbed by the display of trouble , over there , between a man and his woman ? Where had Audrey drifted off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Her eyes were on Flicker  --  and no wonder , Tom thought . Flick 's response to the red-faced skipper of the trimeran was absurdly exaggerated ; the brilliant social engineer seemed looped on a single drink . But Audrey had a cat-like look , watching him  --  inscrutable , alert , waiting in too-perfect poise . Then Tom saw the moment arrive when , with an acuity of peripheral vision that she had , she became aware of his own eyes on her face . The cat stare was instantly wiped away ; she arose , moved to Flick , took the empty glass from his hand where he still held it high as if thinking of hurling it across the water at the head of the red-faced man . She went below to refill it . The hulls were turning , and the wind caught them . The big craft , while still headed mostly upwind , was sailing on its pontoon sides and was drifting across-wind . The skipper accel/erated his motor  --  too late . What was bound to happen , happened . The trimeran gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom , picked up the anchor lines of three peacefullyanchored yachts , aboard which , as it chanced , there were no crews just then . Flicker whooped , half joyous , half furious . Audrey 's head came up to see what had occasioned that bellow . The tangle was beyond belief . The trimeran , buzzing like a hornet , was tugging at the entire raft of vessels . Tom thought of those crews , having gone ashore from their shipshape boats , decently anchored , probably to enjoy a lobster in peace at to Home Port , coming back later to this mess . " Cut your motor , you bat brain ! " Flicker roared . But the skipper of the trimeran was too busy shouting garbled phrases at his wife to hear instructions from any quarter . The blue smoke of the laboring motor 's exhaust blew off in sun-touched puffs . The skipper looked around , head held high , as if out on a perfectly normal run in his elegant craft and waiting to drink in the pretty sights ; he had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and he would look nonchalant at any cost . The four vessels nestled together in a hopeless snarl . Tom felt helpless himself , a mere onlooker just as during the noonday picnic . Audrey was reachingout Flick 's new drink . Flick seized it , gulped it half down , jumped to the quarterdeck , pulled in the dinghy painter , crashed down into the cockleshell , and was pulling away with the short oars hell-bent for rescue before Tom could even catch his breath to decide what to call to him . Something made Tom look at his watch : it was just before six-twenty-five . " Jiminy , " he said , and he rushed below , as though nothing were happening out on the surface of thep59basin , and he snapped on the radio and tuned it for Providence . A newscaster came on strong , with a horrifying bulletin about a babysitter whose dogs , a Doberman Pinscher and a Weimeraner , had attacked and killed the baby she was taking care of , and at the same time Tom heard Flicker and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flick 's advice sounded poor ; the skipper had found a meddlesometarget for his rage . The newsman said the crazed dogs had turned in due course on their own mistress . Tom kept listening with two distressed minds , and when a weatherman , replacing the gruesome newscaster , finally spoke about the wavering of Esme  --  she was now lazing back toward the Carolinas  --  thereport was all mixed in with cries of " Get the hook down " and " Christ , man , what do you think I 'm trying to do ? " So that in the end Tom had no more than a layered , ambiguous impression  --  the storm veering indecisively toward the mainland again , the two fools up there crying their manhoodinto the wind . Tom turned the set off , but he had no desire to go above . It was going to be a good cruise ; that had been decided , that was all set . He sat thinking about Audrey  --  thatlook of a cat , poised , waiting . Then he heard a powerful motor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the ladder . The Coast Guard was having difficulties over there with Flicker , who was waving his arms like a symphony conductor and sounded very drunk . It took an hour to straighten everything out . By the time the Coast Guard came across the water towing a subdued Flick in the dink , it was nearly dark and the wind had died and tiny gnats were flying.  |p60They  were barreling into the blue west with a good capful of breeze . What a morning ! The dome of winds sparkled like a child 's eye . Gay Head was already far astern , pale against paleness , and Harmony was coming up now on the Texas tower , Buzzards Bay light , which stood up stark and angular out of the swells on its tall , hollow , red steel shanks , a mechanicalmonster , alien to the sea . Flick thought it beautiful . From here , from this known point , Tom would set his bearings for the long run in the open ocean . They passed close to the tower 's hissing feet , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the underside of the dizzying platform , so high , to where a derrick peeped over one edge dangling a swaying cable with an ominousbare steel hook on the end of it . Just then a Coast Guard sailor condemned to duty up there slammed a metal door in its metal frame in the metal housing , and the crash rushed down the metal legs , and it seemed as though the very waters of eternity clanged . The course Tom set , with that everywhere-sound stillp62ringing in his mind , was two hundred sixty-six degrees , for Block Island , twenty-six miles away across the open sea . There had been a change in plans . As they had sat at the cabin table , at anchor in Menemsha , looking at , but not eating , the canned peaches and glazed coffee cake that Audrey had set out for the early breakfast Tom had insisted upon , they had all heard together the morning weather report from Providence . For once the forecast had been precise , because the Weather Bureau was now issuing detailed advisories : At six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , semi-literate voice of a meteorological technician , a man used to reading drift meters and pressure guages but not pages with words on them-4he tropical disturbance designated Esme was centered two hundred and eighty miles southsouthwestof Cape Fear , North Carolina . It is presently movingnorthwest-by-west at approximately five miles per hour . Wind speed now seventy miles per hour , an increase from last evening . This intensification may continue . The erratic path of the storm makes it impossible to predict its future course . Seaside property owners from Cape Hatteras , Virginia , to Cumberland Island , Georgia , are advised to prepare for exceptionallyhigh tides , heavy seas , and damaging winds . Tom , ballpoint pen poised over his open log book , had talked about this bulletin in the reassuring tones of a calculatingfellow . These cyclonic storms , he said , had a tendency to loop around in a clockwise curve and go out to sea , as this one had seemed to be planning to do the day before but seemed not to be doing at this moment . Esme was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as of that broadcast , he said , and if she did decide to swing up and out , and supposing that she might graze these offshore islands , asp63these babies had often done in the past , and guessing that her forward motion might be a bit faster than at present , then you could expect that conditions in these parts would become a mite unpleasant after two or three days ... . There was silence from the others . Flick 's cheeks were flushed . The girls both seemed to be staring at the red patches on Flick 's face and not listening to Tom at all . As though sitting in chilly cross drafts , Tom felt two sorts of danger , and neither was the danger of the storm . That absent-minded fixedness of both Audrey 's and Dottie 's eyes ! And Flick : Tom imagined that Flick wanted to talk again about storm-tracking ; that it was not reality , but rather the beautiful linking up of circuits that might whisper to each other about fragments of reality , a process rather than an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that real storm , that interested the man . Doubly frightened , Tom sat and listened to his own tongue running away . There would eventually be heavy rains around here for a day or two , the tongue was saying , even if Esme carried straight along her present path and pasted the Carolinas . The tongue therefore suggested that instead of puttering around the Elizabeth Islands and Buzzards Bay for half a week , as they had thought they might do , and then gradually piling up the westing toward home , they should rather take advantage of the fine weather that was likely for the present and hit right out for Long Island Sound . If there had to be a storm , the chances were good that doing this would put them out on its harmless fringes . If there had to be a real snootful , it would be best if Harmony could be snug on her own **26;7857;TOOLONG anchor at home . The tongue suggestedeither Block Island or Newport for the first night  --  .  |p64either  one a superb sail on a day like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They could sit out the rains ashore , if rains came , and then sail around the Sound for the rest of the time . How did that strike them ? How could it strike them ? They had accepted it ; Tom himself in his cold sweat had accepted it . And ever since then the girls had been in skittish moods  --  Dottie talking a lot , laughing often , on the razor 's edge of being wild , and Audrey irritable yet inexplicably glowing . Flick 's response had been to turn on the full flood of his charm . As they heeled along he kept exclaiming and flinging his arms in praise of the adventure they were having , and somehow these acrobatics seemed to result in his constantly being waited on by both women . Subtly he required their services but not what they served . They brought him sun cream , coffee , Kleenex , binoculars , a pillow , a hat , dark glasses , sourball candies , his camera , a chart , a book of crossword puzzles . He spread all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consuming nothing , keeping the things , in some mysterious expectation , for " later . " The coffee grew cold , and Audrey threw it overboard , prudently to leeward , and replaced it with hot , which in turn grew cold . The collection of the loot of the girls ' pampering constantly increased . For the third successive morning Flick had not shaved , and a seedy crop of blond bristles covered his chin and cheeks ; he apparently felt that he was roughing it in the hardy way of a seaman , but Tom could not help thinking him lazy and vain in the worst sense  --  convinced , that is , that women would think sloppiness an irresistible corrective on a man who would otherwise perhaps have been too handsome.  |p65Now  Flick stepped below , alone  --  going to the head , Tom assumed . Apparently it crossed Audrey 's mind that Flick might have repented his stubble and might be intending to shave after all , and she called down after him , " Let me know if you want some hot water  --  wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doll , " he called up from the cabin . " Do n't anybody come down here for a while . " Perhaps , Tom thought , Flick was changing into bathing trunks  --  but why in the main cabin , why not forward ? In Flicker 's absence the cockpit grew silent . Audrey gazed off to the southward , scanning the horizon , it seemed , for a black cloud the size of a man 's hand , a harbinger of Esme . Dottie took the binoculars out of the case , and without looking through them she began to flex them at the central joint that controlled the distance between the eye pieces , open , closed , open , closed , over and over , until Tom felt like yappingat her for God 's sake to knock it off . Then noises of a catastrophe suddenly began to come up from below  --  a garbled roar , falsetto shrieks , a clatter of pots and pans . The girls both sat up straight , and they looked at each other in a reflexive and intimate sharing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below was capped by a long run of bass laughter of operatic villainy . One last pathetic falsetto outcry . The bass ho-ho-ha of a desperado once again . One hairy hand , then another , gripped the sill of the companionway , and slowly up over the edge came Flick 's head wrapped in a bandanna he had made from a Hermes scarf of Dottie 's ; there was a black cardboard patch over one eye , tied on with marlin cord . The big nose , reddened with lipstick , perched on the sill in a stealthy pause . The uncovered eye darted here and there.  |p66Rills  of pretended fright and laughter poured from the girls . Tom felt a warmth at the center of the puzzling glumnessthat had settled in him even during this glorious sail , and he smiled . Up came the rest of the face . Between the teeth , its line transecting the unshaven jowls , was Audrey 's bread knife drippingketchup . Both girls shrieked , and Dottie flew across the cockpit , and the two wives hugged each other , giggling and squealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyzing , tidying ; what made it so attractive was Flick 's having gone to such trouble for one moment 's naive gag . But the prank was spoiled for Tom by the globes of tomato sauce falling on the pallid , scrubped teak , marking circlets of crimson , and he tried without success to be casual as he dived into the lazuret for his sponge to wipe the spillage away . As he sat back down at the wheel he looked at the girls , both still gasping at the end of the flurries of their laughter , and he thought of their coolness with each other when they had been aboard with him before Flick 's arrival . Then he began to wonder where that black patch had come from . At that moment it occurred to him , as for some reason it never had before , that Harmony had a bad liver . Her flaw was a rotten liver down there in her belly next to her spine . She was a sick boat . Then Tom saw that that small cold core of glumness he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincere hatred of livers , the hatred that was forever invading his mind , his hatred of every element of the huge , viscous , muddy , reddish-brown gland that took up so much housing in the human gut , hatred of any and all Spigelian lobes , Glisson 's capsules , omental tuberosities , fissures of ducti venosip67detailed and closely focused hatreds which he had begun to suspect were simply encodings for other kinds of deep , deep hatreds lying there against his wishes in the right side of his own abdomen , manufacturing gallons of spiritual gall . To his mind the liver was surely where the worst sins had their bed : anger , pride , envy , and laziness . In this century the other sins , having other seats , had become almost virtues : lust was a sign of vigor and civil liberty ; covetousness was the hot key to success ; gluttony was excusable because merely compensatory . But those other four , the ones he now thought of as the liverish sins , they were the miseries that caused most misery . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a decent man . He had used to believe in surgery , but you could not isolate anger and carve it out from all that slippery tissue , pride was not divisible , and envy grew on being cut . Laziness  --  thebiggest trouble-maker of all , the enemy of the word " exact "  --  was wildly self-regenerative . He suddenly wanted to go below and be by himself . The girls were still intermittently chuckling . Flick in his pirate get-up seated himself again in his nest of spoilage , and he began giving the girls foxy looks with his uncovered eye . That patch ? " Listen , big bad boy , " Tom said . " Will you take the helm a few minutes ? " Tom stood up , realizing that this was the first time since the Hamdens had come aboard that he had yielded the wheel to anyone else . " The course is two six six . Try to keep right on the button , O.K. ? " Flick stepped to the wheel and , with one hand on a spoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , buccaneer-style , and scanned the horizon and sniffed at the airp68for a scent of hostility . He started to growl and then as Tom plunged down the companionway he gave out several deep barks and finally began to bay like a moon-broken bloodhound . The girls flew into new giggles . Tom wanted to confide in his logbook . He had checked the very minute of Harmony 's passing the Texas tower but had not written it down ; and he had other messages of precisionto enter : course , wind direction , wind velocity , barometricpressure , tide and current data . And inner measurements ? Vectors of mental drift ? He dropped onto the settee on the port side and slid in under the cabin table , and for a moment he covered his face with his hands . And he saw vividly against the darkened screen of his eyelids : Audrey . She seemed to be waving him back , pushing air with her hands , warning him against something unseen ; there was an urgency about her gestures , yet it seemed to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was serene , radiant , and sensuous . Tom tore his hands away and opened his eyes , and he turned on the seat , reached up to the bookshelf , lifted out the little maplewoodlee-bar , and took down his precious log book . The book fell open at the front cover , and Tom knew at once why he had wanted to come below . Into the black , cardboardish end paper of the book ran a ragged gash which , deep into the page , began to circle and scoop , and it ended in a hole about the size of a hen 's egg . Tom searched then for other clues and soon found on the settee beside him , crudely and tactlessly left in the open , a pair of nail scissors , his ball of marlin twine , and numerous scraps and trimmings of the black stuff . He picked up the ball of twine and put it to his nose and drew in the smell of boats , caulking smell , rope-locker smell  --  the smell which , savored inp69deepest gloom of wintertime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canted mast , splashing bow waves , a warm summer breeze on a helmsman 's cheek . But the smell did not help him this time ; the breeze was right there , above , and he was on the heeling boat right then . He flipped the pages of the log book and carefully entered the figures that were in his mind . Then he went above again and walked the length of the cockpit and said , " Thanks , Flick , I 'll take it . " " Kee-rist ! " Hamden said , harking back to the old joke about the parrot whose cage was covered in daytime by its female owner just long enough for her to couple with a lover . " That was a short night ! " Did n't Tom trust him ? He shrugged , winked his one eye at the girls , and gave way to the skipper . Tom sat down astraddle the wheel box and looked at the compass . Flick , having kept the girls in stitches , had obviously not been paying the slightest attention to the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said nothing . Bringing Harmony up to her course he hated himself for saying nothing . " Oooh , Tommy ! Look ! Over there ! " Audrey , on the high side of the slanting cockpit , was leaning forward and pointing to leeward with a bare arm flung straight out to its fingertip , and her face was wearing a mask of pure childishness  --  eyes huge , mouth hanging open , cheeks reddened with circus delight . Tom , turning his eyes to see whatever she had seen , warmed to her reflex of calling out to him . Had she realizedp70how angry he was ? She had called him Tommy , and he knew that she used the diminutive only at the extreme ends of the range of her feelings : when she was full of love and when she was furious . This time the sound had been good , and he was taken aback by the strength of his gratitude . " Whee ! There ! " He saw three porpoises leaping . In the sunlight the wet gray backs gleamed like stainless steel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harmony cried out with envious pleasure at the sight of such carefree play ; each strong jump built a shining arch of exuberance . Silver games on a clean blue day ! There must have been a school of a dozen , and all of them , with bursts of aspiring to a higher element and splashless falls to the home one , were driving in at a shallow angle toward Harmony 's fish-like hull . , " They 're coming in . They 'll be at the bow , " Tom said . " You 'd better get up there to see them . " The other three ran forward , and soon they were perched at the windward side of the bow , Audrey gripping the jibstay , the pirate next , and Dottie outside with a hand on the lifeline , all three bent at the waists , Flick with his arms around the two girls ; and Tom was alone  --  at his own suggestion , alas . Often he had seen these friendly creatures playing at the forefoot of Harmony , shimmering blue-gray under the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , nuzzling at the breast of the boat , rolling , listening perhaps to the bow waves ' rush or to the wind 's singing poured down to them through the thrumming stays and chain plates and hull , looking upward with little pig eyes , their undershot mouths seeming to smile and smile ; and now , as the school came close aboard , some leaping alongside with wet blowing sounds andp71others taking turns at the bow under the eyes of those three , and as Tom could see the human backs jerking in response to exhilarating glimpses of the sheer fun of those swimmers , and as the three heads turned to shout and share and almost rub cheeks and kiss , Tom felt a flood of melancholy self-pity . He had told his crew to go forward ; he wished he had not ; he wished he could see the bow-play himself . Was the little calf there , learning a new sport ? Could the porpoises , rolling to turn up their eyes , see the human faces looking down ? Did they with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time up there on the boat ? Audrey , leaning forward with that florid arm across her back , drew his attention and held it . What was the hint of grief in her straining now at such pleasure ? He remembered ; seeing her bending over in this way reminded him . One morning at breakfast time , about a month before , he had gone into the kitchen of the apartment and had come on Audrey , bent forward over the counter with almost this very curve of the back , with her forehead down on a wooden cutting board , her hands flat on the Formica on either side of her head , in an attitude of sudden illness or profound worship  --  an attitude , at a level of myth that seeped into his shocked mind , of preparation for human sacrifice ; light blue smoke poured out of the toaster , whose timing mechanism was flawed and which she had apparently been watching . He put a hand gently on her back , feeling the two rounds of the pushed-together shoulderblades . Her face came up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as if from beyond an unbridgeablegulf . She turned away and would not speak . He tried to connect her pain with a minor quarrel they had had a couple of nights before , when each had downed an extra martinip72before dinner and both had , as the evening unfolded , made less and less sense about their lives . But only now , at Harmony 's wheel , seeing her back bent again , being hugged , did he make the true connection . He saw that small bedroom in their first apartment , with the faded cornflower-patterned wallpaper and the brass bedstead Audrey had found , which he loved to polish , and the fragrant Bouvardia , for which she had such a specific green thumb , in the small sunny window ; a Sunday afternoon , a series of unsatisfactorygames of backgammon , restlessness , a dark turn away from the benign mood of the second third of her term , off to the flicks to try The Hustler , a worried murmur , taxi home , lying on her back with legs up , brow wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the g.p. off for the day and the answering service for his cover vaguer with each call , the unmistakable pulsing of the pain , its rhythm speeding up with the inexorability of a bolero , the look dawning on Audrey 's face that all the euphoric plans , the dollhouse anticipations , the beforehanded purchases  --  the bassinette , the tiny nightgownssoft as chick down , the insanely premature Winnie the Pooh , bought to appease recollections  --  all those things were looming as folly , as embarrassment . Then from this tone of genteel loss the occasion suddenly went to the outer limits of grimness : the mythic flood loosed on the bedspread , a writhingstruggle on the bathroom floor to hold , to keep , or else to bear , and at last the empty , cauterized , never-to-be-the-same look . . . Tom could not remember much about the second time , which had been much less violent , perhaps because far less a surprise , but all the myriad pictures of the first were arranged and stored in his mind like the frames of a stopactionfilm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward straightened up , and looking off to starboard Tom saw the porpoises wheelingaway toward shallows again . As the crew came aft Tom half expected to see tears streaming down Audrey 's face again ; not at all , she was in a rapture . Flick began shouting to Tom . " They want to talk with us ! They 're trying to get in touch ! " Dottie 's face was oddly twisted , and as she jumped over the high coaming down onto the cockpit seat and then to the deck , she said with an edge of impatience , " Oh , Flick , let it rest . " But Flick could n't , and he began to rattle on about the Lilly experiments with dolphins in the Virgin Islands , and about the patterns of dolphin speech , which , squeaking , he began to try to sound out , and about their responses to syntheticstimuli , and about the possibility that they might be trained one day to help with fishery as sheep dogs help with flocks  --  and then he was saying that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk with all the creatures around us . There was a rapidity and a flatness to Flicker 's utterances now that seemed tuned by some rheostat of obsession  --  histalent , his joy , his limitation . Dottie , hearing that mechanical rigidity in his voice , began to kick up her heels  --  talked loudly about the porpoises ' dear little eyes , cutting into , and breaking off , Flick 's steady hum . Tom searched Audrey 's face . He could not find the portentousshadows , bending-over shadows , he had fully expected to see . He only saw that she was welded by some kind of solid-state connection to that monotone of inner passion inp74Flick 's voice . Communication , indeed ! Who could ever begin to know what another being was really trying to say ? In the next hour the breeze slowly dropped away . Long before the chop began to flatten out Tom felt the softening of the air on his cheek , and he saw the needle of the Kenyon slip from six through five and four until Harmony was easing through the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her big genny go weak each time the mast fell away from the wind on the rise of a swell ; he knew he would have to start the engine sooner or later . A subtle change was coming over the sky . The air was still clear ; they were out of sight of land , and the horizon was sharp as the edge of a table all the way around . It was far ahead , to the west and south , and very high above the earth , that a huge transparency of vaporous change was becoming visible . A thin gray hood was being pulled up the sky . Tom doubted whether the others had noticed any of this . He had heard the brass clock strike eight times  --  the strokes of noon according to ship's-clock code ; and he suggested beer and sandwiches , and the girls went below . Flick was still going on about understanding wild animals . " Like the mix of voices on the overseas phone  --  you know how the bits of sound are all scrambled up on the transmitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Some day we 'll be able to do that  --  more than that  --  with say a cat 's meow : unscramble the tonality and inflection of the meow and reconstitute it into human words that the cat meant . We already have translating devices for human languages . "  | " Cats might be a good place to start , " Tom said . " They see right through people . " Tom observed for a moment the literalness of Flick 's mind causing him trouble with this line . He would have to reject the idea of cats ' having X-ray eyes before he could understand that Tom had meant that it might not be altogethercomfortable to get into conversation with them . " No , " Flick said , " I was thinking of the vibrations of their voices  --  so easy to chop up and analyze . " By the time lunch was over the sails were slatting . Tom knew he should turn on power , but he wanted Flick to demandit . He went below and dead-reckoned Harmony 's noon position and noted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell open again , as if of its own sense of outrage , to its violated endpaper . As he was sitting at the cabin table , hearing the boom sway and the loose cable of the topping lift drum along the big sail , the expected call came from the cockpit . " Hey , Medlar , fella , whatever you do , do n't shoot that albatross . " That was all Tom wanted . He went above at once , his expectancy eased , and started the engine . Audrey moved forward to lower the sails , and Flick , suddenly happy , followed her . Within an hour the sea was flat and shiny and immense , and the afternoon lights were eerie , for Harmony seemed to be moving into a huge open mother-of-pearl-lined shell of weather , one wing sky , one wing sea . A tip of a bluff of Block Island was visible now at the inner hinge of the shell , twenty-five miles away , and so pellucid was the air that Tom thought that with a powerful glass he would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising in a steady persistence of some kind of stone-lifting work ; in his imagination the sight of them was sharp . The afternoon looked silent , but all the evident stillness was held at a distanceby the sounds of Harmony 's exhaust , now popping in the open , now steamily muffled , as the gentle glazed swells rhythmically lifted the boat 's little metal anus out of the water awhile , then put it under awhile . The dinghy , under tow from the stern on its taut painter , whispered on its path of foam . Audrey , peering into the vast distances of the afternoon , saw a mast ahead , a bit to the right , so far away that the hull under the swaying spar was not yet to be seen . She pointed it out to Tom , and he , thinking to please her , and with the landfall already made , changed his course slightly to pass close to the oncoming stranger . This vessel , approachinglnear at hand many minutes later , turned out to be a jewel of a cutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the glistening varnish . Everyone on both boats waved , and Tom , looking at Audrey as he spoke and holding her eyes , told a story of a hailingat sea  --  how old Joshua Slocum , at the turn of the century , having taken three years to sail around the world singlehandedon his sloop Spray and having floated through rapturesand nightmares of seamanship , standing one day under full sail homeward along the north coast of Brazil , met a steam vessel which proved to be the battleship Oregon . She came alongside him , flying signal flags that meant , " Are there any men-of-war about ? " Slocum in his tiny craft , not knowing that the Spanish-American war had recently started , knowing little more than that he had done a great thing in sailingp77around the world alone , hoisted an answering signal : " Let us keep together for mutual protection . " Let us keep together . Audrey 's eyes turned casually enough to the passing yacht . She asked for the binoculars , and Dottie handed them to her . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tom went below and took Lloyd 's Register of Yachts from the bookshelf and carried the fat book above and laid it like an offering in Audrey 's lap . She loved to look up passing boats , and she read aloud the description of Vesta , and while Flick sat silent she and Tom and Dottie made up scandalous stories about the owner , who was from Houston , Texas , and had shamelessly rendered his sea-going adventures taxdeductibleby registering the boat in the name of his firm . But : " You did n't tell me . . . " It was true that he never uttered a word to her about certain things  --  some that seemed not worth telling , some that would have burned his tongue to tell , some that he thought , rightly or wrongly , she should be spared out of kindness . Not a word had he ever said about that afternoon in the boatyard . He had decided to do Harmony 's fitting-out himself that spring  --  the second year the fat boat was his . Boatyards dislike having owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having " fun " sandpapering , arrogantly mislayingtools , leaving scars of incompletion , making idiotic mistakesthat fall back on the yard crews to rectify in a hurry just when the worst rush is on ; but Tom , willing to pay for hours safe from a phone that might be connected to a liver , hadp78bribed old Burkett to break his rules . Tom sat in the cockpit awhile , that afternoon , getting in a boat mood . It was a day at the end of April when the soft air bore sun-drenched promises . Harmony was cradled near the top of the launching track not far from a great-headed weeping willow down whose undulatingtresses the gold of a new season 's life seemed to trickle and drip as if the sun 's rays were condensing and accumulating on the sap-sticky tendrils . The whole tree was a celebration . Tom , putting off going down into the winter-musty cabin , dreamily watched the tree 's big slow hula dance . But then he thought of the puzzle down in Harmony 's guts , and he made himself go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend , on his first day of work that spring . He had been cleaning out the bilges and , lifting the forward floorboards out , had come on it : the huge bronze ring-nut at the head of the forward of two great bolts that ran all the way down to the lead keel . The nut stood free of the wood of the keelson by a full eighth of an inch . In winter storage the boat sat on her keel instead of dangling it , and the weight of the hull had driven the flaw up into full view . Thinking about it during the week he had remembered two happenings from the previous season that he had not previously connected in his mind : in midsummer the jib had sagged and he had taken up firmly on the forestay turnbuckle , and in late summer there had been a pesky seepage into the bilges . Had he pulled her up too hard and somehow hogged her bow ? Now , armed with an enormous wrench and a tiny can of penetrating oil , he went below to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could not see too well , and he climbedp79above-decks to take the canvas hood off the cabin skylight . Below again , drenched with a shimmering light reflected from the willow , he took a close look . What he saw sent him hurrying to the ice chest to fetch his ice pick . There was a washer-shaped depression in the wood of the keelson around the throat of the bolt . Tom probed with the ice pick at the edges of this circle , and then his heart really sank . The wood was spongy . He drenched the little wound with red lead and fitted a steel plate under the nut to distribute the pressure , and he took up hard on the bolt . Boats , like men , all have flaws . Perhaps it was knowing this that had led Tom to be charitable and to forgive Harmony hers . Since the earliest pushing off from a sea beach of a dugout log , sailors have searched for the perfect craft and never found her . Every vessel seems to have her weak point  --  an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seas ; a prow giving way too generously to cheeks which pound a heading chop ; an obscure leak , elusive , dormantin fair weather , always there again whenever the boat begins to work her seams in a seaway . The sea 's seeming denial of the very possibility of perfection is one of its lures . It took Tom a year , until after he saw how the plate he had installed had bitten into the diseased wood , and after he had begun a thorough study of dry rot , to realize that his redleadingand the plate itself had not halted the infection but had in fact sealed it in and undoubtedly made things worse . There was only one thing to do : remove the sick wood from the boat . Take it out and burn it . But how ? Every frame and floor beam was tied to the keelson . It was a surgeon 's nightmare  --  notliver at all , come to think of it , but a non/regenerative vital organ that simply could not be excised eitherin part or as a whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickness of the timber and tighten the nut again and again , a thread at a time , winter and summer , year after year . Only this summer he had not done it . Last winter with the help of old Burkett 's disenchanted eye Tom had found out the cause of the rot : In a moment of laziness , or carelessness , or making-do in the old Yankee way to save a few pennies , the boatbuilder had made an unforgivablechoice of wood for the keelson . Harmony and her gear were exquisitely assembled , like a masterwork of parquets and inlays , from great woods from the corners of the earth : Honduranmahogany for wheel and coaming trim , seats and decks of teak from Burma , Norway-pine planking , a dinghy of Port Orford cedar , spars of spruce from Nova Scotia , hackmatack knees , white-ash battens , honey-locust cabin bulkhead , cherry-faceddrawers against butternut cabinetwork  --  and timbers and frames of white oak , as hard as the screws that bound them . But when it came to the biggest piece of wood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all along the hull , the builder had settled for a timber of cheap wood from roundabout his shipyard  --  a piece of local red oak . Burkett , on his hands and knees , reaching with the oilstone-narrowed blade of his clasp knife down into the bilges to chip at the big timber , had shaken his grizzled head and said , " Knew bettuh . He knew bettuh . " There just was n't any doubt . It was a lousy piece of red oak , Quercus borealis  --  notorious for checking and cracking and harboring insidious spores . You could be sure the builder had not told the man for whom he had built the boat . It was a secret place in Harmony . Tom , sitting now at the wheel , staring off into calm air thatp81was pure and limpid as elemental truth , reflected that he had not told his crew , his companions in pleasure and danger , about that secret place . He had never told his wife Audrey about that secret place . Her accusations were absolutely justified . There were things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often used in human intercourse as an outlet for vicious cruelty  --  he was satisfied to keep to himself . But Flicker , damn him , harping on transmission of data , with even his porpoises who wanted to tell us something . What was it they had wanted to say just now at Harmony 's forefoot ? What was it ? What was it ? " Would you take a crack at the pump , Flick ? " And then , in response to the blank look that came from the one visible eye : " It 's right under you . Take off the seat cushion and lift up the seat flap . " " Here , I 'll show you , " Audrey said . Soon Audrey and Flick were shoulder-to-shoulder , leaningover , their backs to the cockpit , and they were evidently lifting all the items of Flick 's treasure off the seat cushions in order to get at the pump . Tom dropped his eyes away from the hips and buttocks of those two , which , angled out toward him into the open area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bodies screened from view , and to give his eyes something to do , he checked the compass ; for some time he fastenedhis gaze on the little black lubber line and on the degree mark of his bearing on the floating card , and he tried to rivet the two together , steering Harmony down a railroad-track course.  |p82He  began thinking of Hamden 's reflex whenever he , Tom , gave a command ; no matter how courteously he framed the order , Flick seemed at once to dissolve into a bearing of vagueness , evasiveness . He seemed not to be able to comprehendwhat Tom was saying . Even making allowances for Flick 's not being the experienced sailor he had made himself out to be at wintertime cocktail parties , this response of fogginesswas obviously not based on his failure to understand words Tom spoke . Rather he seemed not to be able to believe that Tom , " idle " at the helm , could possibly mean to commandhim to jump about doing physical labor , and in a big hurry , too . Communication was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it was not just a question of clear and faultless utterance  --  especially when it came to command ; giving commands and acceding to commands required a **29;7885;TOOLONG . Tom thought about skippers of boats who scream at their crews , men who suffer a metamorphosison sitting down at their tillers or wheels  --  mild and courteous ashore ; imperious , tyrai nical , unreasonable , hystericalin command on the water . Tom flattered himself that he was not like that , for he saw himself as more gentle and patient , if anything , at Harmony 's wheel than anywhere else , but now he realized that one specific goad  --  this response of indefiniteness of Flick 's  --  might make an unpleasant commanding officer of him . Flick 's elusiveness was surely a veiled form of insolence . The pirate get-up , which he apparently had no intention of shedding , intensified the effect . Now Tom , with eyes still glued to the compass , heard the gagging sounds of the pump 's beginning to draw , and after a half dozen strokes the first splashes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the cockpit , from where thep83bilgewater would drain away through the self-bailing cockpit 's scuppers . He was both soothed by the sound  --  for the commandwas after all being obeyed  --  and disturbed by it : There was a solid flow from the pump , in due course , which spoke of the extent of the seepage around the keel bolt . Tom looked up and saw to his astonishment that Audrey , not Flick , was at the pump . Flick was sitting across the cockpit , leaning back in grand piratical style , arranging his loot all around him . Tom had not heard any words spoken while he had been gazing at the compass , but now he had the feeling that Flick had somehow conned Audrey into doing the work for him . Command , indeed ! " Hey , " Tom said in a sharp tone , " I asked you to bail . " Flick 's uncovered eye turned slowly toward Tom . The pupil appeared to be in the process of melting ; its look was going vague again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed a long forefinger at Audrey as if she were an object . Without breaking her rhythm , pulling up and pushing down , Audrey said , " I enjoy it . " " That 's very damn funny , " Tom said . " You 've never once told me in all the time we 've had this boat that you got a charge out of pumping . " " Well , I just started enjoying it . " Was she making fun of him ? Dottie , sitting on the port side of the cockpit half way between Flick and Tom , suddenly broke in like a tattle-tale at a playground quarrel . " She would n't let him . " Tom began to tremble . " Listen , you lazy prick , " he said , " when you 're on a boat you have to do your share of the work . "  |p84Flick  , in his woman 's scarf and eye patch from Tom 's log book , bathed Tom with a one-eyed look that seemed to come from a thousand miles away , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Audrey said , still rocking up and down . " I would n't let him . " " The reason why , " Tom said to Flick , " is that sometimes things have to be done in a hurry , or the whole crew gets in danger . Much as we might all enjoy it , you ca n't have anarchy on a boat . There is n't even time for democracy . " Tom realized that his anger was making him pompous . " Surely no one 's in danger now , " Flick said from his great distance , waving a hand out over the level silver sea . Tom felt very much in danger ; his anger flamed into rage . " God damn it , Audrey , " he said . " I do n't like this . I ask this guy to do his first lick of work and  --  pumping 's man 's work ! " " A woman can do it . As I am demonstrating . Forty-eight . Forty-nine . Fifty . " She broke off to rest awhile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first lick ' ? I 've been hoisting and dousing and furling and pitching the frigging anchor overboard and hauling it up again . I 've been extremely co-operative . In my opinion . Anyway , the girls are right , as usual : Audrey would n't let me bail . " They were having fun with him . Tom could see that they were enjoying themselves no end . He wanted to cry out to Audrey that they were n't being fair . But it was Dottie who spoke next , and she was in a state . " He 's a parasite ! Watch out , Audrey . He 'll suck your blood . He 'll drain you till there 's nothing left of you but dust , dust , dust . " Dottie leaned over toward Flick 's circle of pirate treasureand snatched a Kleenex from his box , and Tom saw that she was weeping.  |p85At  that moment Tom intercepted a look between Audrey and Flick that carried him over the brink into knowledge he would have given anything not to have had . He took in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an unguarded moment of conspiracy , false security and  --  what Flick preached for machines and humans alike  --  totally open communication . They gave themselves away . Was it a surging feeling of triumph over Dottie that had led them to be so incredibly reckless ? Tom had a momentary impulse to throw Harmony 's big bronze gear-shift lever ( it sparkled ! he polished it every evening ! ) into reverse . Could n't he move the boat , its now lost crew , his understanding , the terrible incaution of those two , backwards in space and time into the scene they had just been through , then push the lever forward again , so they could take a slightly different course out of it ? But he did nothing . He sat limp at the wheel . Harmony moved forward through the flat sea . It was all being printed in his mind with a dry-aired clarity : the huge sky with its reptilianeye-scale of gray mist winking up from below , the loom of Block Island now a dark heap along the horizon ahead , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene , in all its parts , of immutability , the sharpness of sight itself seeming to say to the inner eye , " This is the way things are , there are no other possibilities " ; Dottie snuffling into flutteringpaper tissues , having lost far more by giving herself away than those two , being two , could ever lose ; Flick projecting his enormous feelings right through that childish birthday-party disguise , immensely sincere in his absurdity , the one eye throwing an open shaft to Audrey , the other covered by the cutting from Tom 's beloved book , the lipstick-rouged nose ap86drunkard 's nose , the bristling skin about the mouth touched with the most enviable pain ; and Audrey , leaning slightly forward , everything about her so utterly familiar , and most familiar of all the softened cheeklines , the eyes expressive of an almost pitying sympathy , the lips on the edge of a pout , and colors here and there of lightness , of humor , of wholeheartedness , and of that same unbelievable pain of desire  --  the expression Tom had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something had to be done ; the moment had to be ruptured . " Darling , "  --  the word leaped to his tongue  --  " would you take the wheel a minute ? " Audrey was on her feet , her face arranged almost too quickly ; there was a crudeness not properly hers in her alacrity . " Sure , darling , " she said . That word flew again  --  to his ear , this time . It was firmly spoken , without a trace of awareness of irony , it seemed . " Keep her as she goes . " " How far do we have yet ? " Was she holding him ? Did she mean that she was . . . she was at least sorry ? " That 's what I want to check , among other things . " He went below . He stayed a long time . He was sitting staring at the raped endpaper of his log book when Dottie came stumbling down the companionway . She stood for a moment at the end of the cabin table with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given him on waking up in her bikini the afternoon before : Help me ! Change me ! He wonderednow exactly what she had meant then . Her warning to Audrey a few minutes ago had told Tom that she had intuited the whole truth long before he had understood a particle of it . How long had she known ? And what did it matter how longp87she had known ? And what if he had used her body under the sun in the cockpit while those two slept below ? Would that have changed anything ? Almost as if she understood his unspokenquestions , Dottie vaguely shook her head and went forward ; soon he heard her sobbing . He turned on the radio to drown her out . He was thinking  --  scarcely hearing whatever was being transacted on the radio ; one endless marathon of commercials  --  thinkingof his old theme , so often carelessly uttered over cocktails on Harmony , of escape and confrontation . That , he had said again and again , was the point of sailing . You got away from the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to chaos . A cruising boat was where , disconnected from society , you could get down to rock bottom about your place in it , and in nature . Big chatter over drinks . Had he ever imagined that the talk would come home ? Those two were alone up there now , free to exchange their telltale looks . What bothered Tom most of all was that he had been so opaque  --  so unwilling , or so unable , to perceive the loss he had obviously suffered some time since . How long had this been going on ? Now confrontation had been rammed down his throat by a remark of Dottie 's and a vibrant glance traded by those two , and the paradox was that there was no escape . He was on a boat and could not run . Slowly there began to trickle through to his mind somethingcompelling about a sound on the radio . he focused his attention . A man was slowly reading . It was the hesitant meteorologist with the dry voice of the morning advisory . He was saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that she was veering again . She was rushing up the sea at nearly thirty miles an hour , northward . Tom turned off the radio without even hearing the man out , and he went above . Audrey 's face was pink and oblivious . Tom sat to one side , letting her go on steering . There was no escape . It seemed to take forever to skirt the northern point and get around to the entrance to the Great Salt Pond . The sky and the sea and the bluffs were gray . Tom was back at the wheel again , and the concerns of the approach  --  watching the bearings on the creeping islandscape , light thoughts of navigation , checking the chart , ticking off the buoys , keeping the log  --  all those familiar mechanical rituals of boat life began to absorb him and save him . Flick had at last taken off the scarf and the eye patch , but the lipstick was still on his nose . He and Audrey appeared not even to have noticed that every aspect of existence was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being discreet  --  and they seemed to have no idea that they had given themselves totally away and that their prudencenow had an almost comical transparency . Dottie had made a disconcerting recovery ; she was right back where she had been beforehand , cheerful , agreeable , trying to please everyone . Flick had casually dropped the oval of black cardboardwith its laces of marlin on the seat cushion , not two feet from Tom , and Dottie had picked it up and kept twirling it around her index finger , as if in this way she could assert Flick 's being entwined , still , with her . They bore down on the heavy jetty jutting out to the northwestward and swung in through the throat of the Pond ;  |p89with  a vague thought of Esme , Tom noted the Coast Guard station to the right of the entrance . It was a fairly long pull across the wide sheet of Great Salt Pond . The place was crowded with sportsmen 's boats . Tom took Harmony to the end of Champlin 's pier to fill up with gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he quietly asked the attendant , a leather-faced man in khakis , whether any moorings were available . " Are you serious ? " the man said ; he was loud and cheerful . " With this harrycane supposed to be coming , we was all filled up ten minutes after they switched the weather report around on us  --  what was that , the two o'clock ? " " What 's he saying ? " Audrey , apparently having heard some interesting word , stirred in the cockpit . Dottie , sitting beside her , looked pale . " About a mooring , " Tom called back over the ticking of the gas pump . " Are you going to take a mooring ? " " They have none . " " Oh . " Had he and Audrey come to this kind of inconsequence ? He was not interested any more in forecasts , portents ; nor did he wish to discuss them . He and Audrey talked about a mooringwithout a word about the meaning of taking a mooring . The concept of precaution was no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment of wondering , for he could not clearly remember , what his insurance policies on Harmony actually covered . He took on water and a thirtypoundchunk of ice , and he tipped the man with a weathered face a dollar on a total charge of less than four dollars . Was he , he wondered , paying off a kind of debt to the Edgartownp90garbage woman ? The indifference of the marina attendant as he stuffed the bill into his trouser pocket was sufficient rebuke to his folly . There was no one for Tom to impress  --  least of all himself . He cut up the ice into chunks , which Flick handed down to him as he fitted them into the ice chest . After handling each piece , Flick loosely tossed his fingers this way and that to shake off the chill . Flick was acting somewhat put-upon ; perhaps , Tom bitterly thought , he felt that Audrey should do this ice work . They cast off . For an anchorage Tom eased over toward the old steamer pier . There seemed to be hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pond . Tom looked for an open place , for he remembered that the water was deep here and he wanted plenty of scope on which to swing in backing winds . But everywhere he went there were stinkpots , and as the other three , a team again , picked out names on transoms  --  Ma 's Mink , Edannboblu , Magic Carpet with dinghy Throw-Rug  --  he went in widening circles , as if searching for something dropped overboard . There was no good place . Finally he anchored , shaking his head , in twenty-odd feet of water not far from the nun buoy nearest the steamer pier . He noticed that a light breeze had come in from the southeast . They went ashore to Deadeye Dick 's for dinner ; it seemed to be understood that the cabin of Harmony was too cramped to contain them that evening . They rowed to the New Harbor pier and climbed ashore and soon entered a room steamy with seafood smells . After three drinks and a half-eaten swordfish steak with beer Flick got the idea that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a pencil from the waitress and he began top91scribble on a grease-spotted doily with lobsters and jellyfish printed in red on it . " Do n't worry , Dottie , " he said . " I 'm going to take care of you . I just want to give old Skipper here my inventions , you know , my thought on fixing up sailboats , all the rights and royalties and perquisites attaining thereto . " He wrote in a scrawl , apparently setting down " perquisites attaining thereto . " " My idees . I do n't know how much they 're going to bring in if anything . Might be nothing , might be a potful . Ca n't tell yet . How many witnesses you need ? " Tom said , " Never mind all that . We can do without your boat gimmicks . " " How many witnesses for a last will and testamen ' ? Audrey ? Dear Audrey , how many ? " Tom said , " I do n't want any part of your **27;7916;TOOLONG machines . Leave me out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Got just the right number . " " Christ , " Tom said , shifting ground , " you ca n't use the people you 're giving it to for witnesses . " " Miss . Miss ! " Flick snapped his fingers at the waitress . The girl , a frowsy-haired fat fisherman 's daughter in a dress of synthetic fabric through which the pattern of the lace of her slip showed , and through that the white outlines of her bra , came to the table giggling at the sight of Flick , as she had giggled earlier : the streaks of lipstick still ran down his big nose . " Sign on the dotted line . It 's jus ' a legal statement , do us a favor , honey . " The girl shook her head and backed away . " Uh-uh . None of that , " she said , turning as if to run . " What 's the matter , baby , do n't you want to get in/volved ? " Then Flick turned limpid eyes on Audrey . " ' Mericans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman scream on a street , she 's right under the street lamp ; they can see these guys frisking her  --  nobody liffs a finger . " Flick stood up and , bumping one table , went into the kitchen . There were shrieks of laughter from two women out of sight . Soon he came out again , waving the doily . " O.K. , honey , " he said to the waitress , " your Momma signed , and the other lady . Come on , just your John Q. Hancock . You can read it . Here . Look . It 's harmless . " But in the dark in the dinghy on the way out to the boat  --  the wind had almost died  --  he said , " Audrey ? You got that paper of mine  --  did'n ' you put it in your bag ? Gim me back . I 'm gon na cancel . Stuffy ungrateful bastard . " " Tear it up . Tear it up , " Tom said . Audrey would n't give Flick the doily . Flick said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your cut . Right ? Fiffy per cent . Right ? " " Is n't that a drop of rain ? " Dottie asked . " Did n't I feel a drop of rain ? " It was in fact beginning to rain . " That 's good , then , is n't it , Tom ? If the rain comes without any wind , does n't that mean the storm is n't going to be too bad ? " She must have taken everything in  --  the broadcast below decks , the exchange on the pier about the mooring . Poor , silent Dottie ! She had it backwards . He did not tell her that but , rather , to encourage her , he said without lying , " The wind certainly has dropped out . " But to himself , slowly , rowingto the scanning of the lines , he recited the adage : Wind before rain , soon to your ale ; Rain bef ore wind , ' ware a fierce gale.  |p93Tom  stood on the foredeck in a furious wind which drove raindrops hard against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gourd . It was seabottom dark . He did not know what time it was ; a halyard rapping against a spreader had wakened him . The tiny battery-powered anchor light hanging from the forestay , swaying in the wind , cast a dim glow about it , making a shimmering globe of luminescence out of the raindrops flying past . Water ran in sheets down across his bare feet . His waterproof hood was drawn tight around his cheeks and chin ; wet pellets struck his face . As wind-puffs rose in intensity they set up haunted-house whistlings at the tops of the tubular wooden chafing guards on the shrouds . The halyardwas still slapping at the spreader with an importunate doggedness , like someone steadily knocking at an unanswered door , desperate to come in from the discomfort and fear of the vast , windy darkness . He listened to the whistling and beating and thought of the various things he should do . He had been roused from his berth and impelled to go above by a habit of thinking : Details matter . They really do matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been stupid not to bring any light above . He went aft and stood for some moments at the companionway hatch , wondering how he could get below to switch on the spreader lights without dripping all over everything ; he knew he could not , it was hopeless , he would just have to grope and drip . He pushed back the hatch and went below as quickly as he could , and he fumbled over his bunk for a flashlight , found it , blipped it at the clock  --  three forty-seven  --  went aft to the power panel box behind the companionway ladder , poured brilliance into the box , found the switches he wanted , andp94flipped them : spreader lights and binnacle light . He tossed the flashlight on his berth and climbed above . Now the whole boat was bathed by the floodlights that shone down from the spreaders : big raindrops driving slantwisethe length of the boat , everything white and everything varnished and everything brass glistening with varied tonalities ; and , all around , the black water pocked with a hissing gooseflesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compass , its whited points and degrees pinkly glowing under the tiny infra-red bulb . The wind had indeed backed . It was north of east now . To be exact : East northeast a quarter east , seventydegrees . He supposed it would settle in at northeast for a few hours , perhaps many . He wished now he had listened with a less muddled ear to the afternoon forecast , and that he had picked up a late evening one . Details accumulate ; they count . He would have to remember to check and log the barometer reading and time when he went below later . He started swiftly to work . He set up canvas chafing gear on the anchor line at the bow chock . He took up hard with a winch crank on the halyards and reset the halyard stops to hold them away from the spars ; the rapping ceased .. . He paused then , as if trying to decipher the real message of this wind . A ferocious puff came running , and hard bits of water pelted his checks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind , " I believe you . I do . " And he set about two heavy and fateful chores to manifest his conviction that Esme , deceitful and unpredictable , had simply outrun all her beautiful data that Flicker loved so much . First he undressed the yawl  --  for he had heard of vessels ripped from their anchorages in gales by flapping sails that had come unfurled from their booms ; he mistrusted thep95shock-cord he had installed to hold the sails in place . He took the mizzen off and stowed it for the time being in the cockpit . Then  --  far more trying task  --  he opened the gate-latch of the track on the mainmast and pulled down the slides of the luff of the mainsail , and wormed its foot forward along the boom track and got the whole heavy sail off at last . He damped the bulk of it down temporarily atop the cabin trunk by crisscrossingover it the free end of the working jib sheet . He went below to the forward cabin and turned a light on there . Dottie and Flick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer skins of the yawl , and both lay oblivious . Dottie wore pajamas ; Tom could spare a corner of his mind to notice that . He burrowed for the two empty sail bags and put them out in the main cabin . Then , with grunts and thumps and clankings , none of which seemed to penetrate to the awarenessof either Hamden , he lifted the heavy fluke anchor out of its seating in the forepeak , and he lay it on the deck directly under the hatch . Next he opened the hatch part way on its forward hinge , so that not much rain could drive in , and he fed out the inboard end of his heavy anchor line  --  beautiful creamy new Nylon stuff . Within a difficult hour he readied his ship . First he crammed the sails into their bags , dropped the mizzen into the main cabin , and lashed the mainsail , inside its bag , into the dinghy cradle on top of the cabin trunk , using two strong spinnaker guys and webbing them tightly back and forth many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nylon line up on deck through the forward hatch ; and he weighted the line , sixty feet from the chain , with a heavy spare flywheel that had been stored for this very purposep96in a cockpit seat locker . He started the engine and swung out to the right on the light-anchor line and got the fluke anchor down and the flywheel overboard ; then swung left with the motor 's help and managed to raise the Danforth anchor  --  for he did not believe in having two anchors down in winds that were sure to shift . He was committed at last to the storm , whatever it might bring , with his vessel stripped and his heavy fluke anchor down on a weighted line . He was burning inside his waterproofs , but a push of elation worked at his throat . He had known what the significantdetails were , had known their relative importance ; and now he wanted to let loose into the baby-teeth of the storm a shout of invitation and defiance . But he stifled the cry before it had built to actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was Audrey . Her hair and nightgown were sopping . How long had she been there watching him ? Her face turned toward him as he looked at her ; it glistened in the rain as though smeared with cold cream her hair was plastered on her forehead ; her lips were pulled back  --  a smile ?  --  a chill ?  --  and her teeth flashed in light reflected from the deck . Did she want to speak ? Did she want to say , " Can I help you , darling ? " Could she help ? Could she make amends ? Could she do anything now ? What could he answer ? Go below . Leave me alone . You 're getting soaked ! Not getting . Already . Everything was already as it was . He stood on the foredeck beside his unfaithful wife in the wind and rain , looking out , as she looked , too , into the darknessupwind.  |p97Tom  started up from a short sharp sleep into a universe of wind . A howl combed through the rigging of Harmony ; every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note of its own . Rain clattered on the skylight and washed with a deeper tone on the decks . From time to time the whole boat gave a rapid series of shudders , as if chilled by thoughts rather than by the wind . The yawl seemed to be sailing widely back and forth on its anchor line , as the gale caught first one cheek of the bows and then the other , and on each tack of this veering the wind canted the mast and the boat heeled over as if reaching under full sail on a day of moderate airs . A constant rattling and slamming of lines and blocks underscored the whine of the whole instrument of the yawl . The hull rocked and slapped on a smart chop that had worked itself up in the confines of the Great Salt Pond . All this Tom took in from his bunk , with his eyes closed and his mind resistant . He had not slept enough . He did not want to enter the new day yet , if at all . He was against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked across at Audrey . She was hard asleep . He wondered if a bad conscience could have a narcotic effect ; then he realized that the sort of obsession she was inhabiting carried no sense of guilt with it . Her sleep was fresh and innocent , her body pure , for what was happening to Flick and to her ( she must have imagined ) had never happened to mortals before . But her hair was haggard ; it seemed to have been blown straight out into strings by this wind . Even her cheeks appeared to be drawn down sadly by the ferocity of the gale , which seemed to Tom 's mind to be raking through the cabin , though his senses told him that the air within was weirdly still . Here in the inner box of the boat the wind was a force of nerves . But in the very midst of bracing himself he began to think of details , the bane and boon of his life , and at once he was standing , peering out through the oval porthole above his berth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soaked day looming beyond a glass streaked with drops and lines and sometimes sheets of rain ; yet hel , made out soon that Harmony had held and was holding . He had marked bearings abeam at the anchorage in the evening light the night before ; he lined up again the end of a wooden pier with a gable of a house up the moor far beyond . He was glad he had set the fluke anchor . Harmony was holding fast . Knowing that , he could look for signs of the day through the bleary glass : greenish scudding water , power boats strainingand careening , the immovable land mass crosshatched by slanting curtains of rain , the nap of the foliage cowering as close to earth as could be , as if with a vegetable patience waiting it out and saying , This will pass , this will pass . He had waxed the porthole glass , in and out , and thep99downpour danced across it in agile globules . Sometimes , when a sudden spillage of solid water curtained the opening , the wind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which looked like the ripples of sand in a tidal pool , and through that brief filter Tom saw a horrifying corrugatedwhite power boat beyond . As the yawl sheered out on a starboard tack and the glass was drained of all but a few scurrying drops , Tom saw the marina dock : a mess of trouble . The glimpse was not long enough to make out more than that things were distinctly not right along the pier . He looked at the clock : nine minutes past six in the morning . Once more he checked the bearings ashore , the pier and the gable . This time Harmony must have been on a different phase of her constant oscillation ; the pilings of the old dock stood forward out of line . Had Harmony after all dragged a bit ? Tom began at once to think , sorting out his mind under the gruesome symphony of Harmony 's standing up to the cruel wind , what he would do if she dragged . Step one , step two . . . Ending , no matter what course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he realized , with a surge of relief , that the wind must have shifted during the night , probably going round now slowly clockwise in the cyclonic pattern ; and that would account for the pier 's being out of line on one side of her swinging . Thank God , she was well rooted in the mud . Here came Flicker Hamden bustling out of the forward cabin , slamming the door back against the bulkhead with his elbow , his unshaven chin belligerently jutting forward , his eyes yellowy and rheumy . No struggle to rouse him this morn-ing !  | " Christ , man , " he said , his jocular tone thinly covering a real resentment , " you told me cruising was the most relaxing pastime this side of  --  what did you say ?  --  the Turkish baths ? " Tom , shocked by Flick 's inconsiderateness , put a forefingerto his lips and then pointed it across at Audrey . Flick ducked and made a face , as if to dodge a blow of surprise , and he disappeared into the head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees and elbows and overriding the storm with athletic pumpings and noises of splashing and of blowing through water . This was a morning to show his vigor . Tom looked out the porthole again , with its fugitive drops running almost horizontally , and reasoned out the wind direction : a point or two south of east . Good in one way , for part of the bulk of the island , rather than a mere sandspit , stood between Harmony and the pile-driving air ; but bad in another way , for by the mariners ' rule that put the eye of a storm like this two points abaft the beam of a vessel nosing the wind , Block Island  --  and Harmony  --  must be more or less northeast of the center and therefore almost dead in its path , where the longest and worst would come . The barometer ? Tom tapped its face with a forefinger . Twenty-nine point seven , and falling . But that told little ; the speed of the fall was what mattered . It was six-fourteen . Loggingthe figures in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turned on the radio ; it was almost time for Sunny McCloud . But Boston could not be heard in this noise , not if he kept the radio low so as not to waken Audrey ; nor could Providence . New London was selling bread . He held Newp101London , and a song came on : " Liar , Liar . " And then another , the Righteous Brothers with " You 've Lost that Lovin ' Feelin ' . " Then praise of a caked bleach . New London was not interested in this storm . " Nobody knows , " the Chiffons lamented , " what 's going on in my mind but me . " Six-thirty passed . Tom turned the radio off . Flick came slamming out of the head , and Audrey , all too fittingly aroused by Hamden 's racket rather than by the storm 's or the radio 's , turned her head and sleepily said , " What are we going to do ? " Flick stood in the door to the forward cabin , seedy in his rumpled pajamas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sit tight . Right here . " Flick asked , " This a good place to be ? " " Ca n't say it 's an ideal anchorage , but we 're stuck with what we have . We 're holding , anyway . So far . " " Should n't we go ashore ? " Audrey 's voice , in her state of slowly emerging awareness , seemed defenseless and trusting , and it wrenched at Tom and made him angry . " In what ? Scuba suits ? " At once he repented this foolish sarcasm , realizing that Audrey had not had a chance to get her bearings . " Could n't very well make it in the dinghy now . " It was the big oaf , the snorter and splasher , standing in the doorway , who made him angry . Who made him angrier now , by saying ( and especially by using a pronoun which , in seeming to distribute the blame , aimed it , to the contrary , through a reverberating irony of tone , all the more tellingly ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got kind of sloppy yesterday . " It was thep102nursemaid 's " we . " Such insolence ! Why had n't he glued himself to the radio , if he intended to treat himself to this big " We " ? " Look , chum . There 's a difference between tracking and predicting . This one out-foxed the boys . Nobody knows enough about storms yet . It still takes human guesswork  --  " Flick whirled away and went forward and slammed the cabin door . Harmony timed badly her next shudder , which came at this moment and seemed to express an old boat 's disgust at her owner 's way of handling things . Tom lit the stove and set some water to boil . He would shave in the midst of peril and demonstrate to  --  to Audrey-that  --  thatShewas standing by her berth in the narrow space by the folded-down table , dressing . She always turned her back to him in modesty when she let down the top of her nightgown and put on her bra ; he saw now her soft back . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the voice of a crying child . Audrey , her symi5athies aroused , leaned to the porthole on her side and looked out ; there she would see the wide and , on that side , almost boatless expanse of the Pond , greenish and foam-flecked all the way to Indian Head Neck . She held her face so close to the glass that two plumes of fogging fanned out from her nostrils ; then she swung around to Tom with a look of total recognition of what they were up against . " We 'd better have eggs , " Tom said in an everyday voice , so controlled that not even his control could be heard in it . " This will be a big old working day , just sitting here . Good fat breakfast , O.K. ? " In seeing the surprise and fear ease from Audrey 's face ,  |p103Tom  felt he might presume to ask her a dreadful question , ask for an explanation , an accounting . How come ? What was the story ? What had gone wrong ? She was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the streaming glass , saw wet hell , turned to him , heard his calmness , responded , felt safe  --  a lot safer than he felt . This sequence gave him rights ; he had a right to whisper a question . What went wrong , darling ? Those two would n't have to hear . Whoosh . Another gust . How Harmony heeled under bare poles ! The moment for the question , if it had ever been there , was gone . Audrey bent to make up her berth ; Tom turned to do the same on his side . They were working together , and it was too early in the morning to talk . The water came to a boil . Tom took a steaming panful into the head and shaved . Interstitched with the wailing of the storm and the creaking of Harmony 's timbers , which in the tiny toilet seemed very loud and urgent , he heard through the thin bulkhead to which the mirror was fastened sounds of a quarrel . Tom felt , under his generalized anxiety and pain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin ; perhapsshe , too , could hear now the mean squabbling up forward . But when he emerged , feeling greatly refreshed , and saw Audrey at the stove , staring at the frying pan as if unable to decide what to do next , he was suddenly let down . He cruelly searched his mind for ways in which he had neglected her . There was that crying child again . Audrey snapped out of her reverie and looked upward . Then she reached in the icebox and took out a package of bacon . Those two came out from the forward cabin . No sign of ap104quarrel . No sign of a hurricane , either . Sunny skies ! They were holding hands ! Tom thought that this was Flicker Hamden 's most appalling effrontery yet . How could he inflict such a mockery on Audrey  --  to say nothing of Dot ? Was he being **29;7945;TOOLONG ? Dottie looked frightened , but Tom felt that he should bear in mind , no matter what might happen later in the day , that she had been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flick , fear or no fear . " What 's the check-out hour in this motel ? " Flick said . " Just got a call from my secretary , says I 'm needed back at the firm . " " It 'll take a while to pack , " Dottie said , bravely going along with Flick 's joke , which fell flat with Audrey , who evidently could not take in anything but that teenage handholding ; and as for Tom , half of him was checking off mental lists and half of him was chilled to the bone with regrets and apprehensions . Both the Hamdens sat down , waiting for service . Tom watched Audrey getting breakfast , and with all of him he admired her so much , there came a moment of feelingsso strong , that he actually had to remind himself of the dangerous storm , and of precautions . And when , as Harmony heeled to a whistling blast , he did concentrate on the storm and realized that its power was far from its peak , his feelings about her grew all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he told himself , in which to repair , take back , forgive , shape up , make amends , atone  --  to put back together again the one important relationship of his life . But then two fried eggs were in front of him , and bacon , and hashed brown potatoes , and buttered toast , and steaming coffee  --  his re/quested hearty breakfast for which he had no heart . He tried to eat ; Audrey 's handiwork was all paste between his tongue and the roof of his mouth . It occurred to him that Flick , seeing him push the food around on the paper plate , would think he was afraid of the storm , and with a Protestant anger he forced the food down . The mass of it lodged itself , to his senses , just under his Adam 's apple . Of course Flick did n't eat much ; the son of a bitch was in love . If there could be Protestant anger there could also be Protestant self-reproach . Tom sucked probingly at his own smugness , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Flicker . Even hating livers he led a more useful life than this tinker . He was interested in inner man , Flick only in electronic extensions of man , devices that dangle from him like prosthetic limbs and mechanical graspers . He , Tom , was n't afraid of the storm , not deeply , because he knew as a man what to do , whereas this big unshaven slob .. . But then Tom had an insight that made him almost want to cast off and lose Harmony and all aboard : The cuckold always feels superior to the one who has wronged him . With this understanding all the succulence went out of his smugness , and he just felt mean . He felt driven to do something . He stood up and went to the closet opposite the head and took out his waterproofs and thin non-skid boots . " Please tell me where you think you are going ? " It was Audrey , speaking out of what ?  --  old habit ? You can worry about me still , ca n't you ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've got to check things . " " Things ! You and your things ! Why ca n't you just sit it out the way you said we were all going to ? " " The chafing gear  --  , " he lamely began.  | " You 'll let the storm into the cabin , " Audrey said . " For God 's sake , darling , we ca n't just pretend it is n't there . " " Oh , go ahead , go ahead . You 're going to take us out for a little sail , are n't you ? I know you . " Tom dived into his waterproofs to avoid thinking about that thrust . She knew him . Yes , she knew him . He lifted the hood over his head and pulled the drawstrings tight around his cheeks . A little sail ? He threw back the hatch and climbed the ladder and rose outward into a medium of violence for which no phase of his life had prepared him . A brutal push from behind , foul and delinquent , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , and flinging out an arm as he fell he grasped the upright pipe stanchion of the boom gallows , and there he clung , astonished , sobbing for breath with lungs which were not elastic enough , it seemed , to deal with this air that stole air . That 's hail coming at me , he thought . The downpour had looked like rain from below but must be hail , for it crashed against the hood of his waterproofs and stung his skin like a solid scattershot . But no ; there were no pellets of ice on the deck . It was just driven rain . His wet knuckles were going white gripping the pipe of the whatsitthegallows ! Aware that the main boom rested overhead on that frame called gallows , he conjured up a detail : He must take down harder than ever on the main sheet to hold the boom from jumping the frame and smashing all sorts of gear . But wait , he told himself . Gather strength . Count to twenty . Count your blessings . . . four , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been in Harmony 's cabin , how he yearned to be below ! And this was only the start ; it would get worse later.  |p107All  at once he began to worry in earnest about the chafing gear he had set up on the anchor line during the night , that bandage of canvas strips he had wound around the Nylon rope to protect it from fraying , and he felt sure that this straining and bucking would cause even the rounded edges of the bow chock to saw right through the line in no time , and he commandedhimself to go forward and see to it . But wait ! That wind would take him right overboard : he could n't just stand up and walk forward and check the chafing gear . . . A little sail ? A little sail ? . . . He reasoned that he would have to crawl , he would have to slither over the coaming onto the outer deck and crawl along it , gripping the handrail on the turtleback of the cabin trunk  --  so this was what that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ! Tom started his move over the coaming . With a heart-thump of selfcongratulationhe thanked God and his own foresight that he had taken the mainsail off and bagged it and strapped it down . He heaved himself along , lying almost flat . That screeching in the rigging  --  he had never heard anything like that . Heave . His face was close to the lovely tight grain of the wet teak deck . Heave . We 're going good now , he told himself . Was everything better , or was he just getting used to this gang-war wind ? Had he thought it had sounded like a crying baby ? Gradually , very slowly , he began to make each move in a rational way . Once he had dealt in his mind with the first shock of the greatness of the wind he could begin to act , to make sense of each action . He got to his knees . Scrabbled along . Came to the end of the handrail by the mainmast . Got a good grip on the bulwarks . He was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scuppers as along a city curbstone after a cloudburst . Still hard to breathe ; mouthp108away from the gale , gulp deep , hold it , move forward . The lashed-down club of the jib  --  he could climb up it , so to speak , toward the bow ; the small boom was made fast to the deck by its own jib leads . Shinny up it lying down . Now he hugged the mooring bitts and could see the anchor line running out through its chock , and he saw that the wide strips of canvas ( they really were canvas ) that he had wrapped round and round the anchor line were doing their work very well . This gave him an enormous lift . He had set up the chafing gear in the dark , and he had set it up right . He had allowed plenty for the stretch in the Nylon line and plenty for Harmony 's surges forward that came between gusts , letting up the strain . He had made a double thickness , two bandages , in effect , and he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . His lashings were firm . He knew his business ! He could take care of . . . A little sail ? How bitter she had sounded ! To look at the chafing gear he had to face the wind and beating rain , but he gulped air and looked again ; it helped his morale . The anchor line was safe for many hours . He had ensured that . This was something he had done right . Easing back down along the deck he kept a sharp eye out for " things . " Everything except the cotter pins of his own life seemed secure . The main in its bag on the dinghy chocks was perfectly snug ; he was exceedingly grateful  --  that edge of self-satisfaction again , even under the pummeling of this wind  --  that he had stripped the sail in the night ; difficult then , impossible now . Soon he was sitting in Harmony 's beautiful cockpit , somewhat sheltered by the cabin trunk , back turned to the gale , used to it now . Absent-mindedly , automatically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth over the brass of the binnacle hood , counting the strokes . Four , five , six . His blessings . He looked up for the first time from the immediacy of the boat and surveyed the world blowing around . At once he saw that several power boats , their windage too much for their hooks , had dragged down in the earlier northeast wind and had smashed against the marina pier  --  a scene of havoc all along  --  and that the lee shore beyond the pier was also strewn with small craft , and some not so small . Tom felt a rush of anger at all driving-license skippers , as he called them ; men with some money in pocket who , because they have passed road tests in automobiles , think they can steer anything with a wheel , and buy stinkpots and go to sea and hail sailors in open waters , calling through a bullhorn , " Which way is New London ? Do n't gim me those compass numbers . Just point . " Idiots . Wasters . Spoilers . Pier-wreckers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new gust of the gale came , and the crashing of raindrops against his hood was almost overpowering , and the anger was blown away , leaving a painful vacuum , into which , in a moment , grief poured . How could he ever ask Audrey the questions he wanted to ask her ? How could so much of life be a waste ? Somewhere there was a muffled new knocking . Had some rigging parted ? It was near at hand . A solid thing , not just a beating rope end . He looked around . Knock knock knock . Then he saw Audrey 's face in the round porthole , low in the forward bulkhead of the cockpit , put there to provide ventilation above the engine . It was sheltered from the rain by the overhanging ledge of the stepway across the front of thep110cockpit , so Tom could see clearly through it . Audrey was rapping on the glass with the knuckle of her middle finger  --  marvelous that he had heard her in all this shrieking . Would he have heard any noise other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had his attention , she began to signal with her forefinger , first pointing at herself , then pointingout through the glass . Incredible ! She wanted to come out and join him . He felt suddenly playful . The grief was gone on the violent air like the anger before it . He laughed . He fell to his knees and bending far forward put his face close to the glass and made cross eyes . Then , flapping his hands close to his rib cage like a seal waving its flippers , he invited her out . But she drew back her face at the closeness of his , and he saw then that both Audrey and Dottie were in their waterproofs . Flick was not . The girls wanted to taste the storm together . Let them . Tom raised up and pushed back the hatch . Dottie started up the ladder first ; her eyes were big , excited . When her head and shoulders were in the wind , she stopped ; she cringed down . Audrey was pressing up the ladder beside her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . What had Flick been saying to work them up this way ? Or did their excitement come from his , Tom 's , having been outside in the wind ? Why was n't Flick coming up to sample the weather ? Audrey raised her head above the hatchway just as a heavy gust came across the Pond , and it was as if she had been struck a solid blow from behind . She ducked . Both girls backed down the companionway . They hadp111already had enough storm . Their faces , tilted up , were pale and appalled . Tom himself was ready for shelter , and taking help again from the firm boom gallows , he got his legs up over the hatchway doorboards and dropped down the ladder . He slid the hatch shut and felt the stillness of the air as if it were a palpable heaviness all around him ; he might have been under water . He took his dripping rain gear off and hung it from one of the catch hooks of the ladder . He felt himself trembling inside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeze , " he said . " We ought to make Hamburg Cove in about four hours in this . " A little sail . He saw from Audrey 's eyes that she understoodhe was joking , answering her jibe with a light heart ; but Dottie blurted out , " Tom ! You 're not going to take us out in this ! " " God , Miss Dorothy , " Flick said , " he 's putting you on . " All the same , Tom caught Flick looking into his face for confirmation . He gave it for Dot 's sake . " Sure , Dot , I was kidding . We 're going to hunker down right here till it 's over . " Suddenly , with that announcement , there seemed to appeara frightful problem . What were they going to do while they waited ? How were they going to deal with each other in this confinement ? The wind whined in the rigging , and they had nothing to say to each other . Tom knew he had an advantage over the others : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost eight o'clock . Iie turned on the radio . On the hour came bulletins , and they were all commonplace  --  an auto wreck on the Connecticut Turnpike ,  |p112three  teenage girls returning from a state beauty contest , all killed by a car that had run out of control across the center strip the wrong way ; an eighty-six-year-old woman burned to death in a tenement fire , origin thought to be a kerosene cookstove ; police in Norwich called by neighbors , having heard screams , to a home where a milk deliveryman , said to be intoxicated , had put a woman customer of his dairy , who had left a note in an empty bottle that she did n't need any milk that day , across his knees and had spanked her with a ping pong paddle . But not a word from the broadcasting studio in its solid building in a solid town about the closest trouble and fear of all , not a breath  --  until the weather report ; and then it came in the most matter-of-fact tones . High winds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gusting to sixty miles an hour , with a forecast of heavy rain and winds verging on hurricane strength through the day , clearing at night , tomorrow fair and mild . " Fair and mild , " Dotty wistfully said . " Be quiet ! " Tom wanted to hear each word . But that was every bit of it . A musical commercial had come on  --  a total moral jolt in the context . Tom fought off a feeling that he was going to get into a labyrinthine argument with Flick about communications , in which he would have to say that all the sophisticated electronic equipment in the world would n't cure this kind of inanity ; it was beginning to look as if we needed tracking devices for storms of social idiocy . . . But he did n't want to quarrel with Flicker today  --  noton that level , he told himself , and he turned his back on the man and checked the barometer again . God , it was plunging . It now stood at twenty-nine point five andp113had fallen to this immoderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the log book from its shelf and squared it before him on the table , and he thought : Now here , just inside the upper cover , is the substance of a quarrel ! To still his revived anger , Tom listened to the voice of the storm . He had come to think of the gusts as great words which an ear , a trained ear in a wise head , but never a device , never a machine , might be able to make rhyme and reason of ; and now one came , a howling long monosyllable , under which Harmony strained as if its every wooden part were being stretched to new lengths , and Tom tried , himself straining , to get the word , and he felt that he almost had it , but the word ended with a crack of something loose above , a hard consonantalending , and the gist eluded him . Then with deliberation Tom lifted the cover of the log book and turned it back flat , so the cut endpaper lay exposed to view . Tom looked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up at once into Flick 's face . Dottie saw it and looked up just as promptly into Tom 's eyes . Flick saw not only the cut but also that everyone else had seen it . Flick looked as if he might yawn . Now , when Tom wanted his anger , he lost it in astonishment at Flick 's brazening . The man looked bored . It was going to be a long day , this ; his telltale jaw muscles were relaxed , his eyelids rather heavy . In order not to be routed altogether Tom flipped the book open and began briskly to write in it . Every item he logged was factual yet somehow muted , understated ; data could not express Tom 's views of this ferocity . He felt drawn to it . Closing the log book and putting it back on the shelf he had an impulse  --  he began at once top114think of it as a duty  --  to go above again . He told himself he wanted to make extra sure that the mainsail in its bag was secure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan Plasson , an acquaintance , a fiercely ambitious woman they all knew . Under the moaning of the masts and lines , amid the heeling and shuddering of the hull , they were gossiping . They were not interested in whatever he might have written in the mutilated log book , but only in how  --  Flick was saying it  --  Joan periodically got a bad back , and it always seemed to be just after she carried on a public flirtation at some party , right up to the brink of scandal , with some older man who was crucially important to the future of Perry , her husband , and then undoubtedly had to march home that very evening and have intercourse with old Perry  --  and zing , musclespasm . Tom stood up and reached for his waterproofs , and nobodyasked where he was going . When he slid back the hatch , Flick said in an outraged tone , " Hey , can that ! It 's drafty in here . I 'll start to sneeze . " The girls both laughed at this threat ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , and Tom saw a blur in them , somethingfrozen just behind the twinkling lenses . Let them gossip for their health 's sake . He pulled the hood drawstrings tight , and though he saw Audrey saying something goodhumored  --  shecould afford it  --  to Dottie , he could not hear the words . He climbed out . This time the shock of emerging into the gale , though expected , was almost worse than the first time , perhaps preciselybecause experience did not seem to ease it . The shock in Tom 's mind was at the possibility that a dead and usuallyp115bland and even sweet , tested , tried to upset , probed for a man 's weakness , and hinted with its howling voice at deliberately evil intentions . Tom , gulping for breath and bringing every canny ability he had into play to steady himself , remembered the word " majestic " he had used in speaking to Flick of the concept of smooth sailing ; the dark side of majesty would be tyranny . Dictator wind : the only aim of despotic power was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Find scapegoats ! Punish the innocent till they seem guilty ! These thoughts rushed through Tom 's mind as he clung once again , to gather his resources , to the upright pipe of the boom gallows ; then his reserves slipped a sickening notch as he thought ( with a curse on the common fund of " modern " psychiatric understanding in which he , like everyone else , crudely shared ) that he might be projecting something of himself onto the surely inhuman wind . The sail . He had come up to take care of a detail . Holding on tight with every move , he made it to the lazuret and reached down inside and put his hand on one of the spare lines  --  a spinnaker guy . Realizing that the wind , whether or not it meant to be evil , would make an irretrievable snarl of the line if he tried to carry it forward coiled , he unstopped the hitch around the loops and grasped the bronze fitting at one end and drew the rope out free . It flew out at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its way forward to the mainsail in its slings , and literally lying across the bag of synthetic cloth he applied this additional lashing , webbing it back and forth around the handrails on either side of the trunk , and took it all up as tight as he could . This left him hot and weak , and it showed him what it was like to do even ap116small jag of work out in a whole gale  --  or perhaps it was a hurricane now . He lay resting on the trapped sail , and he looked out over the harbor . ' Worse confusion than ever . The boats that remainedwere sheering wildly back and forth ; two stinkpots were entangled , one of fiberglas beating to splinters the brokenbeam-ends of an old wooden sister . While Tom watched , the anchor of a small cutter tripped right out and the vessel went down the Pond broadside to the wind , nearly capsizing altogether . No one seemed to be aboard . Torn watched until the boat , almost lost in the rain , seemed to have struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts of debris was floating in the water : timbers , floats , flotsam , planks ; and there went a motorboat awash ! Tom did not want to look to windward to see what might be bearing down on Harmony . Harmony ! A thought of her flaw struck Tom like a poke in the ribs . He scrambled with recovered energies back to the cockpit , raised the starboard seat lid , and began to pump . As he rocked up and down , he was taken with a vision of himself in safety  --  but what a strange picture ! He was at the table in the dining alcove in the apartment at home , and papers were spread out across the tabletop , and he was chewing a pencil  --  making out his income tax return . He was in the act of cheating the United States government of thirty dollars here , eight dollars there , forty-five on another item . Only he did n't think of it as cheating , really , for these were merely those small everyday short cuts and white lies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or unconsciously , as a matter of course ; indeed , began to think of as part of one 's natural rights ; took advantage of for fear of thinking oneself a damned fool otherwise . They were one'sp117private levies against government policies with which one disagreed . Tom , swaying over the bilge pump yet holding on to the coaming for dear life as he watched the sportsmen 's toys on the Great Pond being ripped from their moorings , began to laugh out loud at his glimpse of safety  --  the long columns of figures , the tiny and easy and respectable untruths ! The wind tore the laughter from his lips and flew off with it along with all its other captive wreckage . The pump ran dry quite soon ; the push of the storm seemed not to have told on Harmony 's sore place . He dropped the seat cover . Now he wanted to see whether the engine would start . Not that they were going anywhere  --  but just in case the time might come when he needed to take some strain off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed the hatch six inches open  --  good Lord , they were playing cards on the cabin table  --  and he shouted , perhaps far too loud , for what with the rain crashing on the hood over his ears he could hear only the storm , " Going to crank up the motor . Do n't panic . Just testing . " And he pulled the cover shut , not waiting to read their upturned looks . Sliding to the rear of the cockpit , he checked to be sure the gears were in neutral , and he cracked the throttle and advanced the spark , and he turned the ignition key  --  and then , as though not really caring to know the answer , he paused . An inflated , much-patched inner tube floated past : some summer-visiting youngster 's water plaything , crazily turned loose now . There was so much storm noise ; would he be able to hear the engine ? He pressed the button . He did hear the clang of the starter . But the rain tattooed his hood and he heard nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looked at the panel of instruments on the lazuret bulkhead : Good old engine ! He could see the tachometerneedle , a wavery line of white through a wash of rain , standing at the angle for eleven hundred revolutions per minute . He turned off the key at once and felt pleased . But the satisfaction was brief ; he was restless . He thought perhaps he 'd better go below again ; he could only take so much of this breath-snatcher of a wind . He climbed over and down . With his back to the three and the hatch closed he stripped off and hung up again his streaming slickers , and this time he pulled off his boots . He was bent over fussing at his drippings with the deck sponge when Audrey said , " You really are hell bent on going some place , are n't you ? " " Just in case , just in case , " he said toward the floorboards . He stood and faced his boatmates . Flick had the girls playing blackjack . They had emptied a box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom had a quick thought , which he recognized as'pretty mad in the context of a hurricane , that you could set fire to a boat playing with kitchen matches that way . Flick was dealing . He faced an ace on his own hole card and bet it up and up . The girls stayed . He turned his hidden card  --  a lousy three ! The girls laughed at his bluffing with rippling delight that overrode the wailing above . Dottie won . Her face was suffused with a pink glow of pleasure . They had shut him away again , their three . Tom tried to tell himself that they did n't understand as much as he did about the storm , and that therefore they sheered , like these boats at anchor , between unknowing fear at one extremity of the swing and equally blind overconfidence at the other . Theyp119thought him finicky . He was the one who had n't taken a drink at Quicks Hole . For each of his precautions they had to make some gesture  --  Flick egged on the girls in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could Dottie sit there blushing with the fun she was having ? How could she look so radiant ? She must have some need for defeat , Tom thought , remembering the hand-holding of that pair coming out of the forward cabin . All this must have happened to her , to them , before ; perhaps often . Watch out , Audrey ! They 're using you for their game ! But Audrey was saying , " Sit down and take a hand , Tomaso . " " I want to see if I can get some weather , " Tom said , and he slid in by the radio . At this moment the storm furnished its strongest gust of the morning . The boat was on the port tack , so to speak , and the grappling hooks of this sharp flurry pulled at the masts , and Harmony heeled farther than ever , and shuddered , too . " Watch your matches , " Flick warned , and he put a hand over the dealer 's pile and reached his other hand out , fingers outspread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly with both her hands , and when his came down it folded over both of hers . It stayed there , conveying whatever needed to be conveyed , until the fat boat had righted herself and the shriek of that particular blast had fallen to a moan . Then his hand came away as from a hot stove . Tom , fiddling with the turning knob of the radio without having turned the set on , in order to pretend he had not seen the handplay , wondered how all of them could sit there in such peril and not come out with some big truths that theyp120would have to face sooner or later ; but the thought of truths reminded him of his vision of safety a few minutes earlier , and of his packet of untruths over Form 1040 . He barked out a short , involuntary laugh . Dottie asked , with her head tipped to one side , really wanting to share in any jokes that were going , " What was that about ? " " About verities . " " Oh , for Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cool it . " " No , " Tom said , suddenly wanting to justify himself , and covering up by taking a new direction , " I 'd just said I wanted to see if I could get some weather , and then we got that sample of it . " " Har-de-har , " Flick said , and Tom noticed , perhaps forthe first time , that Flick 's two front teeth were awfully big , almost as prominent as the Mad Hatter 's . Cuckold 's contempt , he told himself , the old Calvinist juices flowing strong . It was time to cool it , and he almost pounced on theradio , and this time he kept sweeping the bands until hefound a good loud Long Island station which seemed to beinterested in little besides the storm  --  a man kept repeatingwarnings to shore dwellers to evacuate their homes , and heannounced the locations of emergency shelters in variouspublic schools and firehouses , and in due course , on the hourof nine , he paraphrased the latest Weather Bureau advisory . He was no meteorological technician ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirts now whirled in winds ofseventy to eighty miles an hour . It was now expected that theeye would be off Montauk  --  less than thirty miles away , Tomimmediately calculated  --  at about one o'clock that afternoon , and if the rate of advance remained constant the whole showp121should be over by six or seven in the evening . The winds could be expected to shift more and more toward the south and then west , and it was expected that skies would be clear before sundown . Then the announcer began to give free play to warnings about what such winds could do , and he recalled many lurid details from the blows of 1924 , 1938 , 1944 , 1954 ; from storms named Carol , Diane , Hazel . He was beginning to sound a bit like Batman , and Tom was in the act of reaching out to throttle him with a turn of his thumb and forefinger when they were all startled  --  Tom so much that he stood up , ready to grab his waterproofs  --  by a loud crashing sound . It took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been on the radio . Now the announcer 's voice came back part way , and it had lost all its lisp and orotundity ; it was far away and small-boyish . " My God ! The tower . The tower 's going . Am I still on ? Are we on , Larry ? It 's buckled , the big tower , the guy wires must be holding it from falling . It 's aimed right for . . . Am I on ? Larry ? Supposed to go ahead ? . . . A technical problem has just risen at the studio shack of  --  " And that , with a little crackle , was the end . Silence . They had all heard clearly enough . They sat speechless for some time . Then Audrey , perhaps angry that Tom had now indeed let the storm into the cabin , said rather petulantly , " You kept telling us it was stalled . Hung up off the Carolinas , ' that 's what you kept saying . " " Darling , " Tom said , " that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  he could n't resist the chance  --  " for the Weather Bureau 's think-boxes not knowing what was going to happen next . " In this moment of defending himself , Tom felt his first deep stab of fear . It was connected with his **32;7976;TOOLONG of a few minutes earlier about the possibility of a deliberately malicious intent in the searching wind . ' What if the whole storm had a mind ? What if it was a willful living organism that refused to be predicted , much less controlled , by arrogant puny human beings  --  Flickers with their mechanicalextensions of their tiny arms and brains ? Tom felt like an ant hearing thuds , through the ground , of approaching footsteps ; the mouth of the anthill was darkened by the shadow of a huge shoe . He 'd seen some orchard trees being sprayed once . What about the inchworm , or whatever it was , in the apple tree  --  what did he think of the wet fog of poison that came from nowhere and enveloped the whole banquet-tree and choked him and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm of death ? This fear had n't to do with any big phony idea of a divine plan . This was the thought  --  which he knew in the moment of thinking was unscientific and probablyworse than that , but the knowledge did not shut off the thought  --  that Esme might be alive , intelligent , and bitchmean . And looking for , among many other objects , the yawl Harmony , with its cargo of human beings who had made a mess of their lives . Flick 's way of meeting an explosive situation seemed to be to ignore it . He asked Tom , quite pleasantly , " Shall I deal you in ? " " Sure , I 'll take a hand . " " Wait a minute , Flick , " Dottie said in a most cheerful voice , " we 'll have to give him some matches . " Matches were money . They were going to give him some money , with which he , too , could play their game . He wondered why he kept his mouth shut . Audrey ! Audrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matches were counted out and the first deal of hole cards came around Tom had another glimpse of a scene of safety . His office . A woman , Josephine Lawlor , a boozer , who had been in two or three times before . She felt twinges . Down there on the right side . He knew she would not believe that she had had her money 's worth unless he gave her what she called a " complete physical , " so he sent her into the examining room , and there , in time , he came to her ; she was in a split starched white examining gown , and Miss Spellacy , also starched and very white , both in cloth and skin , was standing by for propriety 's sake . Blood pressure  --  low enough for a fine longevity of endless hypochondria . A close lamplit look into sticky yellow eyes . A laying on of hands , a kneading of flaccid meat . Rubber gloves ; apertures . " We 'll shoot a couple of pictures , Mrs. Lawlor . Miss Spellacy will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Spellacy : Get blood and urine . And when Mrs. Lawlor came back , dressed , she quite obviouslyfelt much better already . He wrote out a prescription , " temporary  --  till the tests are in , " and called her drugstore after she left to tell the pharmacist to give her placebos . And he made a notation for Miss Spellacy 's later attention : Mrs. Lawlor , O.V. , $25 ... . A smile  --  not pleased , not bitter , but tentative , puzzled  --  onhis lips , he bet twenty-five matches on his first hand and lost . And so they played cards , eroding the cliff-like minutes with little waves of non-committal activity . Few words were needed for their transactions . After a number of hands Dottie won the deal , and her love of the dealer 's power , so odd for one so accommodating , made her seem greedy and a tiny bit fierce . But it was all for fun  --  just matches . The wind pum/meled Harmony and made the shrouds cry . At last the game grew dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply stopped passing out the cards , and she picked up the big matchbox and began stuffing the matches into it any old way , but the box soon filled , and she had to take them all out again and align them to fit them in . Flick kept bringing up one topic after another , cheerfully enough , but the conversation , like the storm , was gusty , intermittent . Occasionally Tom stood up and checked the pier and the gable . Often he looked at the clock . For a time the rain seemed to be letting up , but the wind squalls were bad . Audrey served Cokes . Crump . Something hard and heavy dealt Harmony a blow , with a sound of cracking wood , on her right flank , forward . Tom was on his feet in an instant . His first thought was that a boat had tripped out and run down on her , though he did not rememberhaving seen any craft to windward  --  and for more than an hour the wind had not shifted . That horrible cracking sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was ten twenty-three ; he must put that in the log book with its endpaper ruined . Crump  --  it hit again . Tom pressed his cheek against the porthole on the starboard side , but all he could see was deck and rain and waves . He plunged into his waterproofs and boots and climbed above . The shock of the wind was undiminished ; perhaps it was worse than ever , this time , because now there was a hazard that had not been there before . He held to the gallows pipe , gulping for breath . Then he moved to the right and went over the coaming onto the starboard deck , and he saw at once that there was an enormous dark shape  --  a capsized hull ?  --  lodged against thep125bows . He hauled himself rapidly forward by the handrail and bulwarks . He looked over the bow and saw a roof . A cabin  --  a shed  --  a small boathouse . It was skewed to the right , three quarters under water . It was snarled on the anchor line , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was caught somehow . Crump . Even here in the outer noise he heard that blow , or felt it all through his frame . Those assaults were too serious ; they would demolish Harmony . He crept aft and undid the light lashings that held the boathook and mop . In this wind every act took far more time than usual ; the cords of the lashings were wet and had seized up , and he had to brace one foot against a lifeline stanchion and wrap the crook of one arm around a ventilator funnel to keep himself from being blown away , and he had to tie the mop back down once he had loosed the boathook , meanwhile wedging the boathook under a thigh so it would not take off . At last he was able to creep forward again , this time to the very pulpit of the bow , and he reached down along the anchor line to see if he could free it from this nightmarishly misplaced structure , whatever it might be . Holding the hook straight downwards off the bow took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the wind that was trying to snatch it away from him  --  eighty miles an hour ?  --  a hundred miles an hour ? He soon found that there was no hope at all of freeing the anchor line this way . It was held down as tightly as if the house had been built right from its foundations on it . ' What was brought to bear at the point of snarling ? A hook , a hinge , a nail ? Would it claw through the rope ? He tried to reach a foot down to see if he could push the roof away , but the windp126took the big sail of the waterproof legging and slammed his limb back against the bow cheeks . It was no easy matter to get it back aboard . Crump . He had to make a decision . To delay might be disastrous , to rush might be worse . He put his hooded head down on the deck to rest his neck  --  for just to hold one 's head up in such a blow took fortitude and muscle  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needed in order to decide ? He knew at once that he had not , and he began to make his way aft . How weak and tired he felt without having made a significant move ! What about the boathook ? Might need it later . He dragged it along . He paused on his way back down the deck to lash it down again  --  and here he won a tiny lift to his courage , for he had had the presence of mind , in refastening the mop , to leave ends of the cording free , so now he could make fast the boathook without having to untie the mop again . That was not a matter of chance ; he had thought it through . He could think of things . He and " things . " Crump . He hastened below . Without pausing at the foot of the ladder to take off his dripping togs , he moved forward through the cabin . " Darling , you 're getting everything sopping . " Through the hood he heard her . Would she call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but went into the forwardcabin and clambered over gear and sailbags far up into the forepeak , and he ran his hand along the skin of the hull and up and down the ribs around the area where the blows must have been delivered , and he examined planks andp127frames , and as far as he could see there was no checking or cracking anywhere . Robust Harmony ! She was going to knock the house to pieces . All the same , he wanted to back away from the bows before another of those enormous drumbeats came . One more " thing " to observe . He slithered backwards down from the forepeak and stepped into the after cabin and looked out the starboard porthole . The pier . But where was the gable ? Oh , God , there it was . Out of line to the right . They were dragging anchor now . Just no question about it : Harmony and her assailant were on the move . He turned and faced the three . Flick brought the flat of a hand down hard on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? " Tom did not want to answer , he wanted to think . Where could he think ? Not forward : one of those awful blows would knock any sense right out of his head . Not above : Esme would talk him out of a rational decision . Not here in the cabin , where those three pairs of eyes and Flick 's question pressed him to hurry too much . He stumbled into the tiny box of the head and pulled the door shut and sat down on the john in his waterproofs . He would think about what to do , about how to deal with the bitch storm , about fate and whether and how to fight it  --  sitting on the crapper . He 'd better cut . That was his first thought . The house might stove a hole in lovely Harmony any moment , and she 'd go to the bottom , and they 'd all drown in the wind-fanged Pond . Beach her to leeward ? The chart showed rocks beyond the marina pier and rocks in the mouth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sand shoal she might trip over and fill in the fierce chop far fromp128land . Or , as the wind was blowing at this moment , from the southeast , she might even drift right out the channel to sea . He would need to be able to control her , have steerageway somehow ; the engine would not be enough , not upwind . Betterput on the tiny storm trysail that was made of cloth like iron . Without it the engine would never be strong enough to bring Harmony head-to-wind , in case he needed to turn , or was driven out to sea and wanted to heave to . He thought then tenderly of Harmony , and at once in a reaction against his love for his boat he began to search his mind for the small print in his marine insurance policy , and he could not for his life remember what in the line of storm damage was covered , or whether total-loss-by-Esme would bring him money . . . That kind of thinking would sink them for sure ... Once he had the trysail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boat , take her out through the channel and hug the lee shore of Block Island ? If he could control her it would be madness to try to sail around in the Pond , with hazards on every side . A little sail Was Audrey going to be proved right about him , as she usually was ? But surely this was n't his choice ; it was being forced on him . Or was it ? Should n't he just cut and let fate take care of a beaching ? Why fight it ? To salvage what ? Crump . He stood up at that and looked at his face in the mirror . The orange hood was drawn tight around his forehead and cheeks and chin , and all that showed was an oval of indecision . Mercy and knowingness , though , of a doctor 's face were also there ; he could see traces of a doctor in the face . . . He wondered what it was like for a dying man to look in that face ; he remembered one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Ellis , a retired judge of thep129circuit court , rare primary carcinoma of the liver , lying on a hospital bed and saying goodbye to him . Ellis had great shrubs of eyebrows and a record of probity and compassion . He was so weak that he could barely raise his hand but he wanted to shake hands with Dr. Medlar . He knew . His face was sallow and his eyes glittered , but he was a man of powerful character ; the look was outward . He clearly did not wish to express thanks or sorrow or fear or regrets ; instead , Tom felt that Judge Ellis examined his face with interest and concern . It seemed to be a look of encouragement more than anything else . Why should the dying man offer such a message as that to the well man ? What did that glimmer of concern mean ? Tom shook the man 's hand for a long time . Judge Ellis died late that night . Standing before the mirror now , Tom felt a belated blow of grief for old man Ellis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head as if to throw off confusion  --  to align grief with appropriate objects in the context ; to defy the memory of the old man 's jaundiced look of concern ; to be a doctor ; to be husband to Audrey , will she , nill she ; to be at least himself . His face was wet from the storm 's rain , and it was pale beside the flaming orange of the waterproof . The eyes ? He opened the door to the head and stepped out into the cabin . " What the hell were you doing ? " Flick asked . " Throwingup ? " " Some kind of shed or house has floated down on us , " Tom said . " We 're dragging , and I 've got to cut . I 'm going to ask you to help me to bend on the storm trysail , Flick . " " Whatever that means . " Flick shrugged ; he was trying in extremity to be humorous.  |p130Tom  saw that Audrey was all right ; they were all going to be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack about the little sail he was going to take them out on . They had all badly needed a decisive word ; they looked quite cheered up . " Darling , " he said , " would you and Dottie secure everythingdown below here ? I mean really get things buttoned down . We ca n't have a lot of groceries and pot lids flying around down here . " " Sure , Tommy , " Audrey said . " What are we going to do ? " " Going to get the trysail on and cut and then see what we can make of it . " He knew that all decisions after this one were going to have to be reached more swiftly than this had been . How nice it was to be below ! He clung to being in the cabin  --  found a number of things he needed to do before he could go out in the storm . He took a long look at the Block Island chart to fix every shoal and promontory and bell in his mind . He looked up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy-weather sailing hand on storms and hurricanes  --  notto learn things he had not known but simply to bring every trick he might need into the forefront of his memory . He took down his log book  --  thinking , What does it matter at this moment if there is a cut in a black piece of cardboard ?  --  and he entered , with the most careful discrimination , only those observations that might affect choices later ; then , having written them down , he knew he would not forget them . While he did these things the house struck the boat once . . . twice . . . again . He was being too deliberate . ButFrom the locker under the port bunk he took out fourp131safety belts , and he showed the others how to put them on . " Over your waterproofs . You step through here , you see , so these two straps go under your crotch , and then the main belt goes tight around your waist  --  listen , you 'd all better go to the head before you get yourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever you 're doing , even if it 's only holding on , you attach one of these snaphooks on these free straps to the lifelines . Gives you about three feet of play . " Flick said , " He 'd make a good airline stewardess , would n't he ? " Dottie was horrified . " You mean we have to go upstairs ? " " Above . On a boat we say above . ' " It was Flick again , with that " we " again . He was really tuning up . " ' We 'll all be much safer up there , " Tom said . " After you get your belts on I want you to put on life jackets . The orange ones up in the forepeak , Audrey . I 'd get them but I think I ought to get to work . Oh , one more thing . The Bonamine . Where is it , Aud ? " " In the medicine cabinet in the head . " Tom fetched the little bottle , and he pumped up some drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Audrey took theirs , but Flick shook his head . " It would make me go bye-bye . Sleepyhead . " " Do n't be a damn fool . This is one day you 're not going to fall asleep , I guarantee . It 's Dramamine that does that , anyway . " " Never touch the stuff . " " Look , I 'm taking one . " And Tom did , to show that taking a pill was not unmanly . " Nighty-night , " Flick said . " Oh , come on , Flick . A sick sailor 's a burden . "  | " Unh-unh . I made a New Year 's resolution . No more bonzies . I was on ' em for a while there , did you know that ? Was hooked on seasick pills . So I said to myself , No more . I 've taken my last last bonzy . ' " But the house hit Harmony then , and Tom shrugged . He turned suddenly to Audrey and said , " You 'll have to be his governess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of him today . " Audrey played her part . " I 'll put a didie on his darling little mouth , " she said . " I 've got to go above now , " Tom said , thinking of the uses of the word " darling . " " Do n't forget to batten down every damned thing down below here , Aud . " " You see ? " Flick said to Dottie . " He says above ' and below . ' Not upstairs ' and downstairs . ' " " I 'll need your help , " Tom said to Flick , " as soon as I 've checked some things . " " Aye , aye , Commahndah . " Before going up , Tom took one more look at the bearings ashore . Oh , yes . Harmony 's anchor/had given up thirty or forty feet . There were now only two other craft whose anchors had held . What a pity , Tom thought ; the kedge had been beautifully set , and Harmony might have been the only vessel in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But nowNow it really was time to climb out . On this round , the shock of emergence  --  of being reborn into the outer world  --  was worst of all , because now the storm was no longer an adversary for mere anchor and line , not an enemy simply to hold bottom ground against ; now it was an elemental exposure within which he was going to have to be ap133sailor . He was going to have to cut and sail his Harmony  --  in this . And this had changed , it seemed to him . There was an insistence now , a steadiness , and even though the frightful wind was still coming down off the land , it was no longer coming in gusty williwaws . It had an even force , as if there were no island in its path , as if it had blown the land away . Could one really speak of a lee shore any more ? Tom faced aft , gulping at this flying air . And saw the dinghy . It was half full of water : rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would swamp and be a dangerous drag . Could he possibly , even with the help of all the other three , haul it aboard and turn it over and lash it down on the cabin trunk ? The mainsail was in the dinghy 's cradle . He would have to cast the dink adrift  --  but even to free its rain-tightened painter from the cleat would be ferocious work in this . Cut . He would have to cut it free . There was nothing to do but cut away his last connection with the shore . Once more Tom had a small reason to congratulate himself , and at this moment even such a smallness loomed into a powerful consolation . In putting on his waterproofs and safety belt , he had gone to the trouble  --  as a matter of course , he now told himself  --  to take his big lockspike knife out of his trouser pocket , to slip the loop of its lanyard over the safety belt , and to put the knife in the pocket of the waterproof jacket . A real marlinspike-seaman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his fiddle . The knife 's fid opens shackles and forces the lay of ropes for splices , and its blade , often honed , makes sausage of hemp and Nylon and goes into wood as into butter . Weapon , rescuer , whittler , friend . Scalpel.  |p134Oh  , yes , he was a doc first and last . He was wildly glad that he had made the little move that now rendered the blade accessibleat once ; otherwise he would have had to go below and tear at his waterproofs and fish it out and be angry with himself . " I am going to drown in smugness , " Tom thought , and the thought gave him great pleasure . With his left arm crooked around the mizzenmast , Tom swung aft and pulled the knife out by its lanyard and opened it and in one slash cut the dinghy painter . He was astonished by the speed with which the cockleshell ran down the pond . It sped as if self-impelled by terror . Tom leaned a long time looking at it , telling himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide the greenish , spindrift-flecked pond seemed to have grown , and how tiny the dinghy eventually became in the distance ! Hurry , Tom . . . There it is , just a speck . Tom saw in his mind that sun-soaked and now incalculably precious moment when the dinghy had touched the sand that afternoonat Quicks Hole , in the sensuous tropical heat , when he had been a watcher of what seemed too be the freedom and joy of those three , back before the end of innocence and trust , and long before the onset of this world's-end wind . He lost sight of the dinghy in the rain . Now he knew he must turn and face the gale . He must see if all was in order for the hoisting of the little bikini of a sail . He dragged himself forward along the starboard deck , observing as he went . The mainsail was well tucked in . The halyards were all slapping again , but no matter ; they were well cleated . It was going to be hell freeing the main halyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail on the track , and pulling it up . Crump . Tom put his head down on the deck , for itp135seemed that this had not been a blow of house against boat but of thought against mind . The flaw . Harmony 's sick place . The thought was simply there , a nasty obtrusion . He knew that there was absolutely nothing he could do about the flaw , and that its existence changed nothing  --  it had been there all along . It was only that it had not entered his mind once during his recent calculations about what he should do . How queer ! What a shock to that smugness in which he had been taking such delight ! Might he be forgetting other important considerations ? As to the flaw , there was nothing to do but ignore it  --  bank on the thickness of the keelson . One simply could not think about Harmony 's breaking her back . Having faced the flaw at last , Tom found himself prepared to act . He must stop this nonsense of checking " things " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It struck him at once that Audrey was making a glorious game of securing everything loose . The cabin was stripped  --  plastic cups , ashtrays , pillows , condimentsfrom the galley shelf ; all had disappeared . She had taken the ice pick out of its sheath by the ice chest and had removed the glass chimney and globe from the gimbeled kerosenelamp and had even unscrewed the electric light bulbs from their sockets . She had evidently stowed these objects , and others , in the lockers under the berths , and she was now lashing down the seat covers over the lockers with some spare lines from the forepeak . All this , with Flick and Dottie helping , was being carried out in a spirit of mockery . Safety had become a big joke . Well , was n't it , after all ? Tom went forward and saw that the smallest of the sailbags , containing the never-tried trysail , was of course at the bottom of the heap of spare sails . He burrowed and heavedp136and dragged the little bag out . This sail was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character along the line  --  the sailmaker 's front man , the owner of the boatyard , even a snotty young Coast Guard inspector  --  had praised Tom for ordering and having a trysail , yet all of them had eyed him in a curious way , when discussing it , as though being sensible were a sure sign of being a little screwy . He had ordered the sail to be made of ten-ounce Dacron ; synthetic sheet metal . Only twelve feet up the lull and four feet along the foot  --  an absurd little handkerchief on a mast three times its height and a boom four times its foot-length . He had had it on just once , to fit it . It had looked silly ; he had ever since been somewhat ashamed of it . There it had lain in its bag all this time , waiting for this day . He frugged into a lifejacket . When he re-entered the cabin , carrying the bag before him and obviously appearing in orange jacket over orange waterproofs to have been inflated like a swimming-pool toy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all laughed at the sight of him ; but in the middle of their laughter arrived the pale skins and suddenly wan mouths of realization : It was all quite a lot more than a cabin game of **34;8010;TOOLONG . " Come on , Flick , " Tom impatiently said . " Get on your horse . I said I was going to need your help . " " I 'm all set . Rarin ' , pardner . " But all he had on was the webbed safety belt , which dangled outside his sport clothes like some shameful underharness ; a rupture truss . " Get your stuff on and let 's go . " " You said it : Let 's go . I 'm a big grown boy , Thomas . Dr.p137Medlar wears what he wants to wear , and Dr. Hamdown wears what he wan na wear . I told you I like rain . Right on little me . " Tom felt , as if rubbing it between thumb and forefinger , the hard-set texture of Flick 's stubbornness , yet he thought he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm going to need every bit of your strength  --  all day . Waterproofs 'll help you save it . We bought them for you ! " He was sorry at once he had said that last , which put him so in the wrong . Flicker 's face was suddenly washed clean of all its flippancyand contrariness , and was dead in earnest . " What 's your intention , Tom ? What are you planning to do ? I think I 'm entitled to know what the plan is . . . We are . " Did that afterthought-plural include both the girls , or only Audrey and Flick himself ? How proprietary could he get ? " I told you before all I have in mind . I 'm going to cut our anchor away and then see what happens . With the trysail on . We 'll put that on first . " " See what happens ' does n't quite satisfy me . " " You mean the think-machine wants a more rational program ? " Tom heard the raw childish bitterness in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear Audrey intervene . " We want to know what 's going to happen to us , darling . " He would say it to Audrey . " I 'm going to have to see what we can do under power and trysail . Maybe we can stay here in the pond , but I doubt it . I do n't know if we 'll even be able to come about . I think we 'll probably have to go outside . There 'll be a choice if we do  --  either stay under the lee of Block Island , where the big seas will be broken but the water will be very confused , I 'd guess  --  backwash from swells loop/ing around the sides of the island  --  wind chop  --  and if you ca n't hold up to it there and the storm 's prolonged , you risk the lee shore , Rhode Island , Connecticut ; or the other choice is to take a chance on the open ocean and at least hope to keep going as the wind veers . It 's not "  --  here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick  --  not a choice of caution or daring . It 's just something you have to wait and see about , see what makes sense . " Tom half expected some abusive line about chicken shit ; but the big man looked rather pale . Dottie 's eyes were huge ; she kept swallowing , perhaps in an unsuccessful effort to speak . Audrey spoke for her . " You 're bats , darling . You really are . Why not just let her drag slowly down the pond ? Might take all day and the storm be over . " " Her side would be bashed in by that damned house . We 'd sink in the middle of the pond . " " Then why not cut and just let her go ashore inside here ? Why prolong the agony ? " This was the question Tom cduld not really answer . All he could say was : " I want to have something to do with what happens . " Flick was looking hectic . He was going to press for the open-ocean alternative , Tom felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's go , boss , " he said . " What about the waterproofs ? " " You heard him , darling , " Audrey said . " He refuses to wear them . " " Do n't call me darling . ' " " Really , darling . You 're out of your mind . " But there was an unfamiliar unsureness in Audrey 's eyes.  | " Calling me crazy  --  you 've done it twice just now  --  does n't solve anything . " " Oh , Tommy "  --  here suddenly for a moment was Audrey herself , the known Audrey  --  " I 'm sorry . It was just a . . . an expression . " " O.K. , mulehead , " Tom said to Flick , " andiazn . Hand me the sail when I get up . " Tom climbed the ladder into the storm , took the sailbag from Flick and wrestled it to the deck . Then , shocked yet again , he watched Flicker clamber out , watched for the shock to hit the other man , the thief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style all his own . Flick scrambled down into the cockpit , turned , gripped the cabin trunk , stood up facing the storm , and began to shout . He was soaked through in an instant . He looked wildly happy . Soon both of his arms were sawing the air ; he looked like an Italian tenor  --  a little fat , rapturous , self-important , wooden-armed . The wind caught in the cavern of his mouth , blew out his cheeks , and ripped away his shouts , so Tom could only hear thin , fluttering vowels , ostensibly of celebration : " Ah ! . . . OOOOh ! . . . Ha ! .. . Uh-h-h ! . . . H iyah-h-h ! " Tom began flipping his hand at Flick , beckoning him to get to work . Flick saw him , and opened his mouth wider than ever . " Ha-a-a-ah ! " Tom rolled over and began sliding and crawling along the deck with the sail under his belly . He looked over his shoulder and saw that Flick was following  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket and waterproofs , moved about much more efficiently and easily than he did.  |p140They  were at the mast . Now began the experience of work in this mad air . Both together held the sailbag with their knees , both grasped the clew of the sail , pulling it from the bag , and both strove to get the first slide of the foot onto the track on the boom . Flick was strong . He clenched his jaw and made a struggler 's face . Together they seemed to be frozen in this first effort . The wind , screeching in the stays , fought to tear the heavy cloth from their hands . For a moment Tom felt caught , as if in a photograph , in an eternity of not being able to move or change expression . At last they heaved together . There ! The first slide was on . The slides , one by one , were like the shocks of emergence into the storm ; experience did not seem to help . Each slide asked a peak labor of alertness , timing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from two laborers . At last the foot was all attached ; now the lull had to be fastened to the mast . How could there be strength enough to finish this job and then deal with the storm ? The little lipped metal grips tore at Tom 's fingers as he guided them toward the track , and the more sail they threaded into place , the more the fabric shook back and forth , like a powerful dog trying to break a captive creature 's neck . Flick was strong , and he was responsive to Tom 's lead , and he sang out like a sheet man on a full rigger , happy as a puppy . The rain was streaming across his face and his clothes were dark with wetness . For a moment Tom was in awe of the force  --  was it no more than the wind ?  --  that had brought about his co-operation , so intimate , so interdependent , so willing , with this robber , of all men . What did he and Hamden want in common ? It was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word-snatching storm was clearly going to train them to be deaf men , speaking through charading hands  --  to throw his weight over the boom and onto the bunched sail , which Flick obediently did , and Tom turned his attention to the cleat of the halyard , and he began to fight the wet linen rope , to free it . He uncleated the line part way , passed the loose end beside Flick over the sail , and Flick moved , and with several turns of the rope end Tom stopped down the convulsive cloth . Then he pointed below , meaning , " The girls . It 's time for them to come up . " They slid aft , the two partners in work , on opposite decks of Harmony , and when Tom pushed open the hatch both their faces looked downward . Audrey reached up  --  toward him , Tom !  --  a paper cup of steaming coffee . Miraculous Audrey ! How had she thought to do that ? How long had it taken to put on the sail ? Tom saw that Audrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this moment Dottie was spooning sugar  --  they 'd need that  --  into the mouth of the container . Wonderfulwomen ! He and Flick could not possibly have drunk from paper cups in the gale , for the coffee would have flown out and down-pond just like the words the wind had pickpocketed from within their mouths , but hot coffee would be so fortifyingthat it would justify the effort of climbing down and up again , to drink it . Tom gestured : After you . Flick was dripping at the foot of the ladder when Tom got down . Tom felt so grateful to Audrey for this sign of confidence , and suddenly so hopeful , that he reached his wet face forward and kissed her dry cheek . Audrey , in the act of putting the coffee pot down , was surprised ; annoyed ; suddenly wore a worked-up pleased face . " Sorry , " she said . " It 's instant  |p142I  know how you two loathe instant coffee . " Two ? How know ? Shc ripped several sheets of paper towel from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated the consideration , vitiating Tom 's gratitude , by drying Flick 's face and then his matted hair . As soon as his face came out from behind the towel , Flick began telling the girls how super it was to be out in the storm . " It 's like free-falling through space , " he said . " You put out your arms and you just fly . " And Flick demonstrated in the still cabin , groaning with pleasure . In spite of Flick 's rhapsodic grunts , Audrey remained prosey and skeptical . She asked Tom , " You really think we 'd be better off up there , do you ? " " No question about it . Safer  --  and far more comfortable . You 'll get used to it pretty soon . It 's a noseful at first , do n't be surprised . But you 'll get onto it . " Tom saw that she believed him , and that Dottie , who appeared to be speechless with anxiety , hung on his words . The heat of the coffee and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needed after the work at the mast . They made him think that he knew what he was doing . " Mind getting your gear on ? We 'd really better get started . " Crump . Tom waited for the girls to be ready ; he wanted to be close to them when the gale first took their breaths away . He motioned Flick up first ; it would be good to have him sawing away at La Boheme , or whatever he 'd be putting on , when they arrived in the big windy gray opera house of the outdoors . Audrey . Then Dottie . Then he . He found the two girls crouching in the firstp143full shock down on the deck of the cockpit . Sure enough , Flick was standing over them , gesturing grandly and burping out great sea-lion roars . This wind was like a scandal , amazing and ruinous ; yet for Tom , for the first time , the surprise and awe were diminished . He made flat-hands motions to the girls , meaning , " Stay right there . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands at Flick , applauding his aria , and then beckoned him toward the mast . Their next career  --  the chore might last forever and becomea life work  --  would be raising the sail . Tom crouched by the mast wondering what to do first : unstop the sail from the boom , set the winch handle , uncleat the halyard the rest of the way ? He positioned Flick to tail the halyard off the drum of the winch as he cranked . Then came a new surprise : It was all easy . He unwound the halyard end from the sail , uncleated it all the way , and simply pulled the sail up . It shot up like a self-service elevator , only faster . It exploded as it rose into a shaking that caused a chattering series of reports as of a machinegun . Right through the waterproof hood , right through the acoustical opacity of the storm , **29;8046;TOOLONG . . . He wrapped the halyard end around the drum , and set the handle , and cranked ; Flick tugged at the tail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . That was all too soon that . He did not want what had to come now . He motioned Flick aft , made hand signs meaning , " Wheel . Spin it to the right . " So that , backing off the cut line , Harmony would throw herself onto the starboard tack : more room in the pond that way . Then Tom crawled to the bow and wrapped his hands around the anchor line , and he clung to it for a moment as top144an idea  --  that he would simply haul it in , pull up the anchor , and sail away on a cruise that could n't miss being happy . Ha ! That word for people with solid marriages , or maybe for people lacking imagination . The thought of cutting was suddenlyexcrutiatingly painful , as though active and reflexive modes were bound into one . There would be something self-wounding about this cut . The nasty thought of cost came in from an oblique angle here and made Tom furious  --  not at the notice of loss but at himself for having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more or less a hundred and twenty feet of three-quarter-inch Nylon anchor line , still as white as cottage cheese in its newness . That rope was murder : forty-seven cents a foot . Times one hundred twenty . Let 's see . . . Oh , yes , and the flywheel . And the dinghy already gone . Harmony ! Harmony ! There were , there had been , money problems in their lives . The basic chafe was the affectationof a scorn for money . The shabby values of materialism , all that . But when it had come right down to it , concerning their own kitchen , the value question had been which had more  --  Norge or Westinghouse or G.E . or Hotpoint or Whirlpool ? He had a throttle-hold on the creamy white and slightly slippery Nylon anchor line , as if he wanted to choke out of it the answer to the question : What of value am I about to lose ? He had risen to his knees . He would pull the damned thing up . Sail away cruise . Happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket of his waterproof , and out leaped the knife on its elastic lanyard . Beautiful , glistening stainless-steel object . Spike lying one way , its dirk-point safely couched between two flanges , and the big dorsal sailfin of the blade , with its dark thumbnail slot like a hair of a new moon on a northwindp145night . It was a sea thing , all right ; lying in his hand it looked like a snub-nosed , flattish fish . He opened the blade  --  whetted to a wedge of vanished metal . He held it up so it cut the wind . He could have used it at the operating table : it would inquire its way through flesh rather than crudely cut . He looked around . There was only one other boat left at anchor . Could n't he just wait here , holding his knife at the ready ? How fine to be the very last ! The seas were a dirty green ; foul sick froth out of some devil 's washing machine was flying from wavetop to wavetop . They were now almost half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much had Harmonydragged . The rain seemed to be driving horizontally above the water , like the parallel lines that make fantasy out of the grimmest reality on a television tube . The wind pushed at his neck and shoulders . Wait . Could n't he wait ? To be the last and best ? Crump . He rose to his knees and brought the cutting edge of his knife gently against the taut elastic artificial fibers . The wind made his surgeon 's hand grossly waver . Could he wait at least for a lull ? How would he move aft fast enough to take com-mand ? How hard it was to cut ! Here went umbilicus . He pressed and drew the knife edge once . Razor edge ! One strand of the full-stretched rope was three quarters severed ; another short stroke and that strand broke with a loud crack and withdrew forward right through the chafing gear at the chock and down toward the house and the waves like an insidiously spiraling sea snake slithering into its element . Now that the commitment had been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : with three strokes and two loud reports , the remaining serpents leaped forward and away and down , and Harmony was on her own . Tom saw the house in the water , like a huge , sluggish beast hardly knowing it was free , heave a shingled shoulder and slowly , soggily turn  --  but it was fifty feet away . . . It was a hundred feet away ! Jesus ! Tom scrambled aft on the high side . Harmony had gone off surely enough on the starboard tack . The sail had not been trimmed , and it still was giving out its machinegun reports . She was falling broadside to the wind , and she heeled over hard ; the tip of the boom was in the water . Would she falter and fill in these first moments ? Flick 's jaw was slack , and he was blinking at the stinging rain drops ; he looked suddenly different . The crux of his opera seemed to have escaped him entirely . Tom moved as fast as he could , crashed into the cockpit , hurting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his strength hauled at it , to trim the chattering sail . By God , it began to draw , and Harmony suddenly recovered a certain composure , as , shivering like a wet dog , she rose a bit , took a bite of the wind , and began to go with some purpose toward Indian Head Neck . Elbowing Flick aside , Tom took the helm , standing , and at once he felt great pride in Harmony , for she was holding up and actually making something to windward . The waves in this protected place were enough to make the fat boat canter , and her bows caught the slapping tops and threw white spray that arched upward and whipped across the cockpit to bring a salt taste to Tom 's lips . He leaned down once and turned on the ignition key and pressed the starter buttom ; then afterp147some moments he bent down again and saw by the tachometerthat the engine was running , and he threw the shift lever into forward gear and advanced the throttle . Now ! Harmony was under control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a windless Arizona sky  --  antithesis of Esme there and then . He felt a flood of exuberance , and he glanced down at the two girls , who had pulled themselves up from the cockpit deck and were sitting on the seats and gripping the coaming with both hands and often looking up at him . He was keeping balance by holding the coaming himself with his right hand , and he let go for a moment to hold his hand up and form a circle with his thumb and forefinger . Flick was throwing gestures to the wind and still crying out from time to time  --  or at least opening his mouth like a goldfish into enormous 0 's that should on another day have produced huge shouts  --  but his lips were blue ; he was beginning to look like a child who had been swimming too long and did n't want to come out yet . Just once more , just one more time . If they could come about from one tack to the other , head-to-wind , and providing that no vital gear gave way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was no reason why they could not reach straight back and forth right here in the pond and not lose ground to leeward . The test on tacking would come very soon . The alternative ? To turn tailto-windmight capsize Harmony or take her mast out like a matchstick snapped between thumb and two fingers , for a jibe in such a wind as this was surely the most dangerous maneuver in all of seamanship . Tom realized with a sickening dive of his confidence that he had already passed the point of no return , for he could no longer simply bear off and run down the pondp148and out the channel ; if she failed now to come about headto-wind , he could not avoid the possibly fatal trial of a jibe . There remained , as he remembered the chart , six or seven hundred feet of good water in a cove in the shoals to the right of that black can . Better try to come about now , leaving some room to maneuver in case she could not make it . He pushed the throttle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible from the engine , and he put the helm all the way down , and in all the clatter and shivering of the storm he felt his heart leaping in his chest . The prow moved smartly at first toward the teeth of the wind , but then , as the sail lulled , no longer pulling , and commencing again its racket of gunnery , and as Harmony 's generous cheeks presented themselves to the hurricane , the boat stopped with a kind of thud , so abruptly that Tom had a moment 's fear that she had run aground on a mud bottom . But then he saw that she was being hurled off again onto the same tack as before . He decided to try once more , running off this time to get up as much headway as possible . But it was the same story : She hit that wall of wind and simply bounced off . She would not go round . There was nothing for it but to turn downwind and try to get Harmony around with her stern to the blow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helm , one on the main sheet to try to help the sail to flip over with the least possible damage . He 'd better put Flick on the wheel and fight the sheet himself ; it would be a matter of sweet timing  --  a chance on the wrong split second to lose the palms of one 's hands on the lay of the rope , to say nothing of toppling the mast.  |p149He  beckoned urgently to Flick , who was , however , so passionate in his celebrations of something he had obviously never experienced before  --  the naked , feral claws of mankillingweather  --  that it took him an eternity , a hundred feet of Harmony 's scudding across the pond , to react . Then he lumbered to his feet with the happy stupid look of a souse hearing the high-pitched inner squeaks of nerveless ecstasy ; he was really in a state . Tom made a hand-swimming gesture : around , we 're going around tail-to-wind . A gripping gesture : take helm . You . You take wheel . Me on sheet . Flip-flip : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture : hold it . Wait . Keep us on a broad reach . The spit was coming close ; the whole arm of land appeared to be moving , swinging like a huge club of earth in a nightmare of elements displaced and natural laws scandalouslybroken . Then , with a hand to Flick : All right , swing . No ! Less helm . Wide curve . Right ! That 's right ! Tom uncleated the sheet but kept a full turn around the cleat . The moment of danger would come when the boom would go hurtling across the boat ; he would try to ease it over by trimming and then letting it slip fast but not too fast , with always a turn on the cleat . There was no way of knowing how much strength he would need beyond all that he had . How Harmony scudded down the edge of the big curve ! Now to the unlikely task of gaining a little on the rope . Now . Marvelous new surprise : He heaved and got some . Now . It was coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Crouching and squinting upwind Tom saw the crucial instant flying across the water at them like a manifestation ofp150the shortness of life  --  it was a moment he thought he could actually see winging like the fastest of birds . Here ! Let the rope run ! Harmony dug in on her starboard bow as if she meant to go straight to the bottom and end this mad game men seemed to want to play . But the boom had gone over with a bump , not a splintering crash ; the mast stood like the noble tree-bole it once had been . Harmony came up with a bounce and heeled hard on the port tack . She had jibed . Tom saw at once , recovering the helm from Flick , who looked goggle-eyed with his own accomplishment , that Harmonyhad run so far down the pond in this maneuver that she would never be able to climb back upwind sailing across toward the pier again . The main issue was settled : He would have to take her out to sea . His wild joy at having pulled off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with a dry-mouthed effort to swallow . There was much bitter salt on his lips . They recrossed the pond , not fetching the marina pier . He set Flick at the wheel once more , jibed again in good order , and eased Harmony off toward the channel at the bottom of the pond , and he found that he was filled , now that the wind was at his back , with a fathomless calm . He would not probe that calm . It was not easy for the others to look at him here , for to do so meant exposing their faces to the buckshot of the rain ; for a few moments he was in a way alone . But then , almost at the same instant , as though they were all wired to each other by some contrivance of Flick 's , those three seemed to realize that he was persisting down the gale , that he had given up so soon the effort to reach back and forth , and that he was going out , and they all turned , blinkingp151and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand pointing to the barely visible gap of the channel . Tom nodded . Yes , they were . At this Flick raised two fists and pounded at the onslaughtof wind . To Tom the gesture seemed an ambiguous display of rage-in-joy , of cruelty yet of a sense of sheer fun . A man might beat a drum with the same double energy . It came through that Flick had personified the storm ; the storm was a shrew , and he intended to have his will of her . Some women had to be treated like alley cats . Poor Audrey , jilted so soon in favor of new proofs ! Yet this sky-beating of Flick 's was pathetic , too , because  --  Tom could not help exulting even now  --  Flick was condemned here on Harmony to a passive role . He was a passenger , really quite ignorant of the power of the sea , and he could not fight but could only watch the fight and hold on for life . Audrey , on the same side of the cockpit with Flick , did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she was not interested in abstract ideas , of mastery and participation , or of the durability of the male spirit ; she was concerned with practicalities , and she reached out the snaphook of her safety belt beyond the coaming and tripped it onto the lifeline , and she made signals to Dottie , who was in a daze across from her , to do the same . More significantly , she reached forward and picked up the strap dangling from Flick 's waist and snapped his harness to the lifeline ; she seemed to know that he would never have done this for himself but that he would not restrain her from doing it for him . Tom , grateful for her alertness , attached his own . Dottie seemed to be all of a heap  --  weakened by incredulity . When Harmony ducked and bobbed on a pair of seasp152outrunning the hull , Dottie 's head wagged as if it were afloat quite apart from her body , like a lobster-pot buoy . Yet when she understood Audrey 's suggestive hand-flips , she reacted soundly and quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Though bewitched , she could respond and do what had to be done . Fat Harmony almost planed like a Dragon or a Sunfish ! Tom bent down to see the dial of the Kenyon . Whee ! She was spooning along at her maximum hull speed under that tough little kerchief of a sail : nearly ten knots . Tom had flown often in jets  --  six hundred miles an hour through the thin fluid of the pure blue stratosphere  --  but this speed on the angry green water , with the forefoot plowing out curving sheets of white urgency and the following seas almost pooping the stern and the rain flying and the stays whining , this was surely faster than any other swiftness on earth . Yet the thrill of it , close and real as it was , scarcely penetrated the core of stillness at the center of Tom 's being . In a sense this calm was harder to face than the rain-pricked wind : a little sail , he was taking them out for a little sail as his unfaithful , wife had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid , but he was bathed , soaked , submergedin such profound doubt about his wisdom and indeed his sanity in doing what he was doing that he could only wonder at the calm . It must be the eye of his own personal storm . And yes , how soon the pond was eaten up by that speed ! The Coast Guard station was in sight to the left : the flagpole , the Stars and Stripes surprisingly left flying in the rain , and out to one side the two square hurricane-warning flags , red with black centers , one above the other , frantic at finding themselves out in what they were announcing . Too late top153proclaim it ! And the launching rails  --  succor , the shore people caring about mariners in peril on the deep . Tom hooked a knee over a spoke of the wheel and pulled back his wet left sleeve with his wet right hand and saw the time through the wet face of his watch : eight minutes to ten . Was that all ? Three hours till Esme 's eye would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a need to enter one piece of intelligence  --  Passed CG station , 9:52 a.m. , on way out  --  in his log book . He was convinced he would never be able tocarry that in his mind , and he felt it was an almost historic item . He leaned forward , tapped Audrey on the shoulder , and made hand motions commanding her to take the helm . She looked up at him in astonishment but at once reached out , unsnapped her belt and re-snapped it on the after side of one of the lifeline stanchions , and slid back into position to steer . Tom sliced a hand toward the center of the channel , between the two long white lips of breakers on the inner shores of the pond , and she nodded with a grave , rather childish look  --  acceptance of a too-heavy responsibility . Tom , feeling sorrow pouring into the calm place , tore himself away , piled down the ladder , sat at the table , got down the book , and opened it . No time for endpapers now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember to record ? For a moment his mind was totally white , then he saw Audrey 's face , a crease of concentration and willingness between her brows ; and suddenly the blanked-out details came to him in a rush , and he jotted a series of telegrams to himself . And slammed the book shut and shelved it , recognizing that he was a fool to have come below to do this ; and scrambled above.  |p154They  were already half way along the heavy jetty . He took the helm ; patted Audrey 's shoulder . She slid forward , adjusting her safety strap . Ahead Tom saw an amphitheater of gloom so deepvaulted , so dark , such a mare 's nest of contending energies of air and water , that he suddenly wanted with a frenzy equal to that of the surface of the sea beyond the jetty  --  knowing that his yearning was hopelessly tardy  --  to turn back : not to go out there . The actuality of the jetty close at hand on the left , its huge jagged dynamite-sculptured stones glowing in the reflected light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the channel buoys , black cans and red nun , their designating numbers ghostly white in the storm , past which marks Harmonynow scooped in her headlong dash , and the evidence of the low land to the right , the pigtail of Indian Head , sandy , grassy , barren , anciently windswept and sea-swept yet still brownly there  --  the vivid clarity of these nearby sights of a stationary world made the distant view all the more appalling because so uniform . It was a huge arch of gloom in which there was no hope of seeing anything but wetness and motion . Nothing relieved the monotony of vague danger that lurked in motion . Clouds , rain , waves , darkness , all rushing into  --  what ? Invisibility . A huge cone of uncertainty . The one element that rode all others , the dominating force of the seascape , the wind , could not be seen ; but one could see what it was doing all too well . Tom realized that in erupting from pond to sea he was going to be moving as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin to hurricane abovedeck . He held himself tightly to meet this new shock . At the same time he must think ; he had only a hundredp155yards in which to make a decision . His original plan had been to trim sails and turn northward at the outer can off the end of the breakwater , and to sail up along the lee shore of Indian Head , clinging near to land , not more than a hundred yards off the long beach . But now that he had found that he could control a jibe in waters that were not too disturbed , should he not instead jibe as close as he could to the end of the jetty and reach southward under the lee of the much higher main body of the island , where Beacon Hill and Monich Hill rose to two hundred feet ; and where , besides , there would be six miles of lee shore compared with four of the less good shelter to the north ? A kind of whining buzz at the edge of his mind told him that it made no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice . He kicked at the loose sheet lying in disorder at his feet , as if trying to boot that sense of futility out of the vicinity . Audrey saw his kick , and at once she bent forward and began to coil the line . There was only time for one short blurt of inner response : If only she knew how much she helped him ! Fifty feet left . The trouble with going south would be that the wind would be shifting as the eye of the storm moved through , and Harmony would be sailing more and more into the teeth of the gale  --  and toward the center of chaos . But there was the danger , to the north , of the long reef running off the end of Sandy Point , and one would never be able to see the black bell that was three miles above the tip of the point ; after his search of the chart in the cabin before the cutting , its forms were engraved so clearly on his mind  --  light green land , blue shallows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the mouth of the pond  --  that he could almost read off the hair-raising soundings along the North Reef : four feet , one foot , three feet , four feet , five feet , a long comb of the sea to catch at the keels of fools . Oh , no , he would n't let Harmony be tipped there . The decision , as it came to him , was of a kind he did not like to make : almost on an impulse , and in fear of that hidden hazard . He liked to be more deliberate , to weigh and weigh and know he was right ; but there was no time left . He leaned forward and whacked Flick 's knee , and he shouted at the top of his lungs , almost screeched , " Prepare to jibe ! " Flick sat there , his face turned back to the storm and to Tom , grinning in his stupor of auto-intoxication . Tom could tell that the wind had torn the shrieked words from his teeth like bits of dandelion fluff and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barren . Audrey was pushing at his side ; Audrey wanted the helm ; Audrey had understood . Had she read his lips  --  or his mind ? That same inner blurt : If you only knew ! Tom jumped to the sheet and hand-flapped to her to put the yawl around . IIarmony had begun to buck , and it was harder here to keep a purchase . Here went the boom . Bang ! That was too rough ; but at a glance Tom checked the stays and boom and machinegunning sail , and all the gear seemed to have held . He trimmed in the sail , and Harmony began to move . When he relieved Audrey at the wheel he was horrified at the first glimpse to see how far offshore Harmony had blown in taking this turn . Was it half a mile ? He wondered if the dread that had come over him of the universal bleakness outp157there away from land made his mind exaggerate the distance the yawl had fallen away from the beach . Flick had stood up . He was turning this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that he was singing loudly and ( for Tom remembered other songs at other times ) badly off key , though of course nothing could be heard , and he was making hugging motions , opening his arms and grasping at the wildness and embracing it , over and over again . Tom , who was seated now , trying to concentrate on getting Harmonydriving , nevertheless gave a split second of his mind to wondering what Flick was singing . " 0 beautiful for spacious skies . . . " " Embraceable You " . . . That nice old one , " Stormy Weather " ? Audrey , bless her , was not in the market for serenades . She was coiling the main sheet again . Only now , after the flurry of action died down , did the shock of being outside suddenly grip Tom . The irrevocability was what hurt the most , for this lay heavy on the back of the judgment he had made . He had been inside , where he could have beached Harmony in shallows , and now he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no such thing as deciding that he had made a mistake and that he should go back in . He looked down : Someone  --  could it be he ?  --  was clutching the wheel with white-knuckled hands . He looked quickly away from those bloodless joints . The modes out here were darkness and confusion . The water was a dull greenish gray , and off the tops of all the waves the wind knocked breakers that were themselves gray and foul . The seas , behaving like those of a furious tidal rip , were not inordinately tall , but they were steep and foam-tipped , and they seemed to come from every hand at once in spite ofp158the concerted drive of the wind in the one direction , and Harmony was thrown about without rhythm , with no steadinessof rise and fall . She pounded , shuddered , rolled , pitched , wallowed , and shook , heeling all the while under the wind , and her sail was now full and making her rush down a wet riffled hillock like a train of cars , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed by a frontal crash of hard water , so that the cloth rattled with one of the few distinguishable noises of the general storm-racket : that machinegunning . Everytime the bow hit , a blanket of green rose to windward , and the air shredded it into stinging spray that flew flat across the boat along with the rain . She was moving . He could see the end of the jetty ; they had traveled perhaps two hundred yards more or less southward since the jibe . She was moving . Whether she was holding up to the island it would have been hard yet to say . He glanced at the compass several times and found that she was heading on the average almost truly south  --  in toward the bulge of the land ; but doubtless , with the pounding she was taking from both wind and air , she was being set down to leeward as she went . Something struck Tom a sharp small blow on the shoulder . At first he could not see what it might have been , but it beat him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the cabin trunk and flailing back and forth  --  the free end of the jib sheet which had jumped its coil . Surveying the boat Tom saw that the whole vessel was a battery of such whips  --  loose ends of all sorts of lines , standing straight out from their fastenings and licking at whatever might be down wind : two from the lashings of the mainsail , the outhaul on the main boom , the topping lift on the other face of the boom , and many others . He was being flogged by an invisiblep159hand on Harmony !  --  the grim seaman 's accounting of old tradition on sailing ships . The sight of all those whips stirred up the dregs of puritanism in Tom , and he was suddenly filled with a righteous anger , which was displaced from the storm and from the injustice and indignity of his position , and was now aimed at these reminders of unfair discipline of long ago . He tapped Audrey again  --  by now he had given up on Flick in his endless act of congratulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he began to climb here and there subduing the cruel ropes . He knew it was a mission of folly , but he could not help himself . His father had never punished him except with looks and words ; but he thought of his father now as cruel  --  a tall , thin man in a carpenter 's apron ; he was a schoolteacher , not a carpenter , but had a hobby of woodworking , and Tom visualized him in a cellar room under a cone of electric light . He thought , as he crept forward , hooking his safety belt as he went , of the boatswain 's mates on the squaresailfrigates carrying ratline rope-end whips called colts coiled up in the straw crowns of their naval hats , and , conscious of the incongruity and on the edge of laughing at it , he imagined his father as one of those petty officers , with the colt coiled like a cobra on the top of his head . The yawl was heaving under him , and Tom was aware that he was expending great amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political liberalism ; nevertheless , he secured every last one of those whips . Then he started carefully aft to take back the helm , his anger assuaged , his fear of the dark , endless world of the storm outside the harbor for some reason diminished . He crept past Dottie on his way into the cockpit . She turned up her face and gave him all she could give him , whichp160was a trusting smile . It seemed to him that her endurance would be inexhaustible , and in fact that mere endurance was somehow refreshing to Dottie . She was growing sweeter as the wind grew more harsh . Audrey looked cross ; she seemed to be in a fury , yet Tom was aware how quietly responsive she had been , all along , to his seamanship . Maybe she was angry at the opera singer . Flick had made his point ; his joy was getting boring , and in truth it was beginning to look trumped up . Seated again at the wheel , Tom checked the bearing of the end of the jetty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not falling away much from the land , if at all ; she was , good ship , not going very fast in the miserable chop , and that meant it would take her a fair amount of time to go down the five or six sheltered miles . Which caused Tom to remember that the engine was running , and at a high speed at that . They might need the motor badly later ; better try her under her handkerchief alone and see how she would manage . Tom leaned down and switched off the ignition key . For the next few minutes he could feel no difference at all in her painful progress . Glorious little trysail ! Tom , settling to close care of his helmsmanship , thought how really odd had been that vivid photographic glimpse , a few moments ago , of his father , in the naval uniform of the middle of the nineteenth century , with the looped scourge in his hat , standing by the gratings near the mast in the place where ship 's court was held . In school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridled at his father 's schoolteacherish droning about steadfastness , hope of a better world , loyalty , service to others , honor , kindness  --  as totallyp161sentimental and obsolete ; Tom had laid the foundation for this momentary snapshot of the thin man on the frigate deck by having thought for so long of his father as a nineteenthcenturysoul , one who rationalized self-service with mouthings of altruism and liberalism . Tom 's father simply had no understandingof how Korea and the bomb tests and the Calcutta famines and the white response to the Montgomery bus boycottand the exposure of Stalinism and ( especially for Tom ) the shock of his hero Camus dying in an automobile accident as if encapsulated within the full irony of his own writings  --  the downhillness of everything since the Korean war  --  how all this had made the generation of sons in this time mistrustful of slogans , sharply sensitive to cant and hypocrisy , suspicious of big and good words . . . Yet . . . Yet how that picture had burned itself in his mind just now , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Father ! I did n't do it ! Do n't look at me like that ! No ! No ! Tom turned his eyes to the water to evade that piercing stare of the man who wanted his son to be a good boy . There was a queer phenomenon on the waves : Wherever the wind could get at any flattish surface of water it made a new pattern of tiny ripples of fantastic swiftness of phase , so that with tremendous speed small wavelets were being built on the backs of the bigger chop , and chop on waves , and waves on swells as they backlashed around from the open ocean . The generation and regeneration of roughness was  --  majestic . That word had a way of renewing itself in his mind . And gripped by the majesty , looking briefly into the dark bowl of fury to leeward , Tom was suddenly aware of Harmony'sisolation . They four were alone on the sea . No eye was watching . The Coast Guard would not know to come forp162them ; futile entry in the log ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tom thought of fighting his way onto the Lexington Avenue subway in the afternoon rush hour on a summer day . Numberless humanity , rancid and struggling for breath under the slow , dusty , wood-bladed rotary fans . How often , gripping the overhead handles , he had thought : There are too many people  --  that 's what stirs up the impulse to violence , to riot , to war : mere crowding . Give me air ! I 'll kill for a lungful of air ! . . . And here was air coming at a hundred miles an hour , in plentiful supply ; of all humanitythere was no one else anywhere . Just three other pairs of lungs besides his on the whole sea . Those other three were glancing at him from time to time ; each in his own style  --  Audrey irritable yet answering with alacrity his most obliquely suggested commands of abstractskipper to abstract crew , not as his wife but as a nautical hand , reacting even to gestures and motions that he had no idea implied demands or requests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , for he must have realized his inner resources of wildness were never going to rise even to the level of parody of those of Esme ; and Dottie , thi Dottie who had worked up a sharp little quarrel earlier on this dangerous morning , seeming now to digest every horror and fright and make her own kind of carbohydrate of it  --  each looked around at the skipper now and again to read his face , as though it were a barometer of some sort , a dial of the pressure of their fate . Their looks  --  each with its own accent  --  were trusting and confident , and he found that he was gaining faith in himself . Harmony was plunging along ; he had thought of things , and they had come this far . He reveled in his preparedness . What did they think of his prudence now , his cautious/ness that showed in every tiny detail of the regime on Harmony ? What did these three free spirits , who had expressed , whether they had consciously intended it or not , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hole , think now of his trait of being careful ? Their lives depended on it . They adored it . They looked at his face to scan it for readings of just that very thoroughness of mind . How grateful they were for the spoilsport now ! And just as they checked the dial of his face again and again , he came to realize that he was repeatedly checking the face of his watch , as though he could push the hands forward faster with the rays of his eyes . But those hands were incrediblysluggish . He wanted the worst to be over soon , but , it seemed , the swifter the wind , the slower the minutes . Eight minutes past ten . The eye was promised for one o'clock . He could get through three hours . Then the eye ; he would n't even think of what lay beyond the eye . Three hours were nothing . Where had most mornings of his life flown to ? Three hours ? But now he waited as long as he could , felt the tiredness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that tiny sail , waited , alertly watching the oncoming seas to try to avoid combers hitting broadside and cross-chop slamming the bows , and waited and waited , checking gear all over the boat with a roving eye , and waited , giving his boatmates , with whom he was in such deep personal trouble , encouraging looks as the man who thought of details and would watch out for them , and waited as long more as he could , and waited still longer , and finally looked at his wrist again . Three massive minutes had managed to struggle away . It was eleven past ten . He could not let himself think any more about space andp164time ; with a tremendous effort of mind he tuned himself in on Harmony . Details . Saving details of his yawl . If he could concentrate all his energies on keeping his boat intact  --  forget human lives , which were in shambles anyway , and think only and always of Harmony  --  perhaps he could get through the immeasurably empty and ominous storm-area and the gaping eternity this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear their straps out of the boom ? Would the splice of the halyard , wire to rope , hold out ? Would the rudder gear take the strain ? But br-r-r-r . No ! This was no way ! To catalogue the details that might go wrong , and about which he would be able to do absolutely nothing ? No , no . For details to have the capacity to rescue one from fear , they must be manageable . He could steer , that was about all . Be alert , steer . So what could he do but count on Harmony ? He did , he did ! Look at her rise to that attack of water ! Listen to that rapid firing of the tough cloth  --  and feel her tremor under it ! Harmony ! Beautiful old tub ! Sick boat . She was diseased . Remembrance of the flaw hit Tom and intermittently struck him again and again , just as the rope end had kept at him , distracting him as he tried to keep his mind on his helmsmanship . Why had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the big keel bolt ? He went back and back to try to trace what had kept him from doing as he had done every year since his discovery of the soft-fibered place in that lazily chosen timber ; the answer dodged away from him . He thought he might have been able to trace the source of a decision affirmatively taken , but this was just a not-doing , a putting-off , an accumulation of days when he simply forgot , or omitted , or inwardly refused , to do what should have been done . How could you get at the root ofp165procrastination ? He tried to remember whether there had been occasions  --  in the city , at the office , speculating over a patient 's dysfunctional liver ; in a taxi , stuck in traffic , enjoying escapist musings about the free play of movement on the sea  --  when he had suddenly remembered the flaw and said to himself , " I 've got to haul her out ; I really must ; it 's overdue ; I 'll have it done next week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no trace this summer of such determination . At the same time he had kept Harmony wonderfully spruce in other ways . He had had refinements and improvements much on his mind . He had rigged new shock cord for quick-furling of the mainsail , he had installed snatch blocks for easier cleating of the sheets , he had varnished and polished and always carried scraps of boat lists in the pockets of his business suits . Audrey turned her head and looked at him  --  Audrey , in whom he had not confided about that small fault of spongy wood : after all , it was a trifling matter . Harmony was thirtytwofeet long , and this place in her guts could not have been more than four inches from edge to edge ; perhaps less . Exceedinglysmall in the whole picture . If he had plagued her about every detail of Harmony 's existence , she would have screamed with boredom . Sailing was his obsession ; she had been willing to indulge it  --  up to a point . The flaw had somehowalways seemed , until yesterday and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now , as she faced around and drank at his expression , he had an overpowering wish to tell her about it at last , before it might be worse than a shame not to have told her , and he actually shouted into the screaming gale , " Harmony has a bad place down around the forward keel bolt . It 's dry rot ! I said DRY ROT ! I never told you . I 'm sorry , darling . Audrey ,  |p166darling  . I 'm sorry . Keel bolt ! Dry rot ! " He knew , in the very act of getting this off his chest at last , that she could not hear a blessed word . Audrey let go the coaming for a moment and made a gesture , palms of the hands turned up to the sky , shoulders lifted , clearly meaning , " I have n't a clue what you 're saying . What do you want of me now ? " Tom beckoned . Helm . Take the helm . Tom wanted to make an inquiry of Harmony by pumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicious seas doing to her ? What was this pounding doing to that place ? Dottie was sitting over the pump . Her big eyes were watching everything ; she had seen Tom mouthing his confessioninto the wind , she had seen the beckoning motion , she had seen Audrey relieve Tom . Tom wondered briefly whether Dottie could lip read , whether she was more acute than Audreyin certain areas of intuition . But now when he moved toward her she looked stricken , as if she had inadvertently done something wrong to the depths of wrongness , and she in her turn let go of the coaming and put up her hands in a pathetic gesture of trying to stop his probably punitive approachtoward her . He could not stand in the wind on the lurching cockpit deck ; he thumped down heavily beside her and began to make motions to her to move  --  please move aft  --  want to pump  --  you move  --  change places . But it appeared that Dottie was used to that seat ; it must have become her safe place . She turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom put his hands on her shoulders , and he felt through the waterproofs the rigidness of Dottie 's arms . She would not budge . Then he thought to unsnap her safety belt and refasten it abaft the lifeline stanchion  --  just as Au/drey did with her own each time she moved back to the wheel . Then he rose and , keeping one hand on the coaming behind her back , placed the other in front of her , also on the coaming , and he leaned over her that way , seeming to keep her safe in his arms , and jerking his head toward the after part of the seat when she looked up wide-eyed at him , and signalling with his eyes that he wanted her to move , and pressing her with his left arm , he felt her give a little , and he smiled to encourage her , though he felt that the wind was constantly molding and reshaping his face into clownish grimaces , but apparently the smile did show , and gradually she slid aft , little by little , moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the coaming . How shallow her sweet looks and trusting smiles , which had seemed so sincere , must have been ! Finally she was settled out of the way . He went at the lid of the seat and scrabbled for the pump handle like a man dying for a drink and lunging at the pump of a suddenly discovered sweetwater well . Oh , how he thirsted to know ! He barked a knuckle and saw blood but felt nothing . Pumping was not easy ; Harmony lurched when he wanted her to buck into a downstroke , and she threw him sidewise when he tried to draw the piston straight up . But soon the pump primed itself and he felt the weight of suction in the pulls . He began to count . A marvelous serenity came over him .. . nineteen , twenty , twenty-one , twenty-two . . . Arithmetic must surely have been man 's earliest tranquilizer . . . twentyeight , twenty-nine  --  what ? air in the cylinder ?  --  thirty , thirtyone . . . Yes ! That was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bilges ! Tom let the seat cover slam down and he turned and threw his arms around Dottie . Her stiffness slackened at once ,  |p168and  she eased into his embrace . But he was not hugging her ! he was hugging Harmony ! He loved his yawl just then more , he thought , than he had loved anything or anyone in his whole life . How brave and sturdy she was ! And how loyal to him ! She would cover up his negligence . No one  --  not Audrey even though he had roared it at her at the height of the storm  --  would ever know . But the memory of his confession made him think , in the moment of turning toward the wheel with a heart leaping with relief and joy , and in the act of patting Audrey on the shoulder to say he would take her place  --  made him think of her unfaithfulness , of his predicament within and beyond the storm ; and that same heart of his suddenly felt like a bag of damp sand lodged in his chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there looking drunk . His lips were bluish now , and for some reason he appeared smaller than usual , as if all his gestures and bellowing had deflated him , and his bigness had merely been gusto . Tom had a moment 's thought , which he recognized at once as irrational  --  but somehowthis unceasing shrieking wind made irrationality more accessible and admissible than usual  --  that this man who refused to wear waterproofs or life preserver was in league with the hurricane . He had been shouting something to Esme all morning . What had it been ? Dottie was leaning over the coaming to leeward . She was throwing up . It was getting rougher all the time  --  there was no doubt of that  --  perhaps because Harmony was moving down the coast and more and more slop was curving round Southwest Point , or perhaps because the first seas of the shifted winds beyond the eye , outrunning the storm as waves could do , werep169coming in from the south off the open ocean , or perhaps because there was a great rip of tidal currents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a wild Brahma bull just out of the rodeo chutes . Was she trying to throw Flick off her back ? A moment would come when she would rush up a wave front and simply keep going , until half her bare flanks were raised up into the sky . Could the wind pick her up by the belly and flip her over on her back ? No ! Eight tons ? Eight tons of Yankee workmanship , all of it sound as a silver dollar  --  save for that one lousy piece of pinchpenny lumber ? Even this wind could n't make Harmony fly . But when she shot up like that , naked in mid-air to the hips , and hung for a moment on the lip of a wave , it really did seem as if she might become wholly disconnected with the affairs of this earth . But then she came back down  --  and with what a thump ! And out from the cheeks went two curving planes of smooth green shot silk , which disintegrated forthwith into a million driven drops of brine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To think of the seas as confused might no longer be accurate ; there seemed a plan , a deliberate malice , in the unpatterned turbulence of this water . Esme the bitch knew what she was doing . The moment Harmony leaned to that little trysail 's work , a counterwave , driving with macabre ferocity against a ninety-knot wind , would heave up under her leeward chines and tip her right into the teeth of the hurricane , so that the trysail would go dead , rattle , shiver the boat along her whole length , and then , on another rise from another quarter , the sail would pop full of air and begin to draw again , and then still another contrary surge would knock Harmony flat to leeward till Dottie 's vomitp170would be flushed clean off the deck outside the coaming . Poor seasick Dottie ! Tom realized that he had not guided her back to her safe place ; that had been thoughtless of him . Was she going to be totally helpless from now on ? Tend your wheel . Mind your sailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in the world , and you had better accommodate yourself to loneliness . No better time than during this endless aeon before the eye comes . So Tom spun the wheel , trying to guide Harmony through a maze . She had , in spite of the methodical obstructionof the waves , a goodly amount of steerageway , and when he turned the wheel something happened . Most of the time , when the sail was full , he felt in the spokes the influence of a powerful windward helm . Was he exhausted ? He did not know . He knew that he was working hard , and that his shouldershurt when he thought about them . The wind was at a new height of frenzy . He decided to try laying-to in order to rest awhile , the age-old recourse of weary sailors in violent storms in the open sea  --  lashing the helm slightly to leeward and trimming the sail so that without his steering at all , Harmony would settle into a perpetual cycle of heading up into the wind , stopping , going backwards till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bow fall off , then , as the trysail would catch the wind again , sailing forward and rounding up into the teeth of it once more ; and repeating the whole process without his having to exert a finger-muscle on the wheel . He was just about to raise himself off the lazuret lid to get at a pair of looped lines with which to tie down the wheel , and his mind was so set on this plan of action that all else had gone out of it , when there came an explosion.  |p171There  had been machinegun fire before ; this was a cannonblast . A violent detonation . Tom , in the act of rising when the noise came , shot all the way erect and was promptly hurled forward across the wheel  --  the engine had somehow blown up , and he was being upended by the deck 's eruption beneath him as it was driven up in splinters by the blast . His ribs hurt , and as he sprawled there with his face not far from the cockpit deck he could see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not the deck . Not the engine . A lurching sea must have dropped him this way . He pushed himself back up and sat down hard behind the wheel . The first thing he saw was that all three of his crew were turned inward in the cockpit toward him . Their faces urgently asked him the question to which he did not know the answer . Their trust this time was ill-founded . Then he saw . The trysail had blown out . It had disintegratedto shreds . It hung from the track in a thousand ribbons and tabs and flying threads . The heavy synthetic cloth would not tear readily along the weave like cotton duck , and it had simply burst with that dynamite roar . There was a fluttering like that of a congestion of panic-stricken terns around the mast . Now hundreds of tiny scraps of the sail were beginning to fly out away from the mast , still attached , pulling and unknitting the strong threads of the fabric and flying like uncontrollable kites straight out from the mast and away from the hull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastened in his direction , Tom gestured . There . Look . That 's what it is . The heads turned on automatic swivels ; the eyes looked ; the heads turned back again , as if on a single set of cam gears.  |p172Such  trust . They wanted to know what he was going to do now . So did he . He saw at once what value the trysail had had . Harmony had , in instants after the explosion , become a dead thing on the water , and now the wind and waves had her completely at their mercy . One huge forehead of water with blown foam for a head of hair butted her hard and threw her into the dreaded helpless position of small boats in bad weather : she was broached , broadside to the wind , her port flank exposed to the raging air , neither heading into it nor running away from it , the most apt attitude for a capsizing . She heeled over in the wind under bare sticks , and waves began to break on her high port side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute stinging drops of spray flinging themselves over the coaming turned out in aggregate to have been many gallons of salt water , which only slowly drained from the scuppers of the self-bailing cockpit . Within a short time water was sloshing around Tom 's ankles . His first thought , because of Harmony 's broaching , was to heave to under a sea anchor , a tough canvas cone whose drag would at least hold the yawl 's head into the wind and keep her out of this danger of swamping . Oh , yes , he had one , and with a heightened clarity of mind he could place it exactly : It was stored in what he called the canvas locker , at the after end of the cabin on the starboard side , under the breadbox , a deep cavern where he kept the hood for the forward hatch , the bosun 's chair , the canvas bucket , the lead line , and many odds and ends not often needed but needed badly when they were . Not once used , the sea anchor lay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heap.  |p173But  then , thinking it through , he knew he would never in this storm-world be able to rig that big cloth cone , which would rip itself out of his clutches and take off in the air like a spinnaker ; he 'd never get it overboard from that prancing foredeck in such peremptory wind . There simply was no chance of it . The unclothed boom was thrashing viciously back and forth . It would be too risky to try to lift the rack of the gallows and fight the boom down onto it . He uncleated the main sheet and strapped it down as tight as he could and cleated it again , at a high cost of time in danger . Then  --  so tardily !  --  it hit him : Steerageway . He must get her out of this helpless wallowing before she went over ' and down . His big brain was n't as crystal clear as he had thought , by a long shot , because he knew he should have dived for the ignition key at the very moment of the loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he set the throttle and spark and pressed the starter button , and he kept his eye on the tachometer . Lovely engine ! Off it went at the very first contact . He threw it into forward gear and pushed it to two thousand r.p.m. ' s and put the helm down . And yes . Slowly . Nothing like what that absurd ten-foot sail had been able to do . But yes . Up she moved toward the wind and out of that particular kind of unsafeness . Patches and ribbons and tag ends of the small sail were still fluttering along the bolt rope against the mast , little flags of Dacron to taunt the storm . But now his motor was holding her up . The faces were turned toward him ; they followed his moves like radar-tracking aerials . The motor was doing well.  |p174He  must reassure them . He chose to nod  --  curious dignified gesture of his hooded head , signifying a satisfactory state of affairs but promising nothing . He had the engine revved up too fast , he must throttle it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a taxing rate itself  --  the ticker kept Harmony out of the worst gutters of danger . Now to think ahead . He could turn  --  not head-to-wind but transom-to-wind , a kind of dry jibe  --  and keep as close under the lee of the island as possible , going back northward . There the big bulk of it still was  --  half a mile away ?  --  three quarters of a mile ? Harmony was probably not holding up quite so firmly as she had been under sail , and it was likely that she would gradually slip to leeward away from the land . But the protected water , though turbulent , was a known condition ; if nothing went wrong Harmony could survive in it . What time was it ? Tom nonchalantly lifted his arm and let the hurricane push up his sleeve so he could look at his watch . Might as well let the damnable horror work for him . Eleven sixteen ! Marvelous adversity ! It had ripped all those tough-textured minutes away like scraps of the sail . Two hours , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eye of the storm Tom knew he would have to sail out into the open ocean . The eye . After the eye the wind would come in , probably harder than ever , from a new direction  --  and since the eye would be passing close by them , the new direction would be almost precisely opposite to its present one , for the eye was the gimlet center of a counter-clockwise vortex of winds ; and instead of being under the shelter of Block Island then , Harmonywould be in close peril of being driven down onto thep175land ; there were rocks all along this shore . He could not turn north again . The motor might not take them clear of Sandy Point at the northern tip and clear of that keel trap of a reef north of that , in two hours . Indeed , he had no way of knowing how far south they had come up to now , and whether there was enough time to get away from those rocks before the eye arrived and , after the eye , the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head for the open ocean . Having decided , Tom felt , once again , an unsureness that had all the discomfort of a surge of guilt . The lives behind the three pale ovals facing him depended on his judgment . Was what he intended to do really wise and right ? Like the sea around him he had been confused in these last minutes -- should have started the engine right away after the sail blew out , should not have toyed all that time with the fantasy of setting the sea anchor , should not have grappled all that more time with the slatting boom . If he was confused in small things , what of the fatal ones ? Should he not have gone north in the first place ? What had their " little sail " become , anyway ? Flick 's lips were the green of scuppernong grapes , his skin was white as a table cloth . The man was standing up . Was he going to sing now ? There was a look of astonishment on that discolored face . He opened his mouth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stuff  --  Flick 's interior color was vivid enough  --  blew back into the cockpit . Tom put the wheel over in sheer disgust and headed out to sea . Escape and confrontation . When one said , " getting away from this world " by going sailing , what did one mean ? What world was there , what world had there ever been , besides thisp176one , with foam at its lips and a single evil eye that took forever to look at one ? The storm was the true world . Camus ' shade of existentialism had seemed the only viable set of thoughts for Tom in college and medical school ; The Rebel had been the bible then . Somehow the man whose eyes had been sharpenedby the sand-edged sunlight of Algeria , and who had had the guts to fight Hitler in the French underground , seemed to be able to see after the war precisely the absurdities that one felt most galling in the years of America 's catching up with Europe in disenchantment and disgust . But now : Now all that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectation of pretended existence . What one spoke of as " this world "  --  the city ; the office ; people with putrescent livers and distended pocketbooks ; himself going down Madison to the Westbury for a lunch of lobster bisque and chef 's salad and a nice little Riesling  --  " this world " was only a shadow behind the reality of a vicious and ceaseless wind blowing on a sickly sea . " This world " was the fugitive memory of a rather bad dream . He thought of what he had said to Flick that first evening in Edgartown about the illusion of fighting nature that you could get on a sailboat , when a line squall hit you . It was over soon ; it was only an illusion of dealing with forces . What nonsense all that was ! Illusion ? That had been the imaginary existence  --  sipping drinks in a fat unyacht on a mooring in Edgartown harbor ; this fight , to the death , was the reality of life . Out to sea ! Take her out from under the lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the storm  --  one might find the dead center of reality , the self . Look at her go ! WheelHe was no longer trying to fight her up into the wind . In order to get clear of the base of the island he was drivingp177Harmony off in a more southwesterly direction , keeping her head up just enough so as not to broach again and taking the steeper and steeper down-wind waves on the port bow , climbing , perching at the crests , then charging down , moving better now all the time . The wind kept the masts canted and gave the whole boat a semblance of the stability of a close reach under sail . The engine marched ; Tom 's one lingering fear was that in the midst of these violent motions some sea-water might slosh past the traps of the exhaust and go steaming back up into the works . He must not dwell on that thought . She was going well ; he should take each wave as it came and be thankful for surmounting it , if he did . Up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at times Tom thought the intermittent glimpses he was having of a shadowy bulk of solid earth were imaginary ; that elusive shape was not solid at all , but was just a cloudbank , a thickening of the fluid of gloom that stretched out to the limits of sight in every direction . Had Harmony fallen so far away from the shore that it could no longer be seen ? Had they moved out from under the lee ? Not yet , to judge by the seas . But . . . but had there ever been a Block Island ? Had there ever been dirt , rocks , grass , bayberry bushes clinging to the ground under a brilliant sun ? Two of the three faces kept turning towards him . Flick , in his vomit-and-rain-soaked shirt and with his hair sprayplasteredto his skull , had sat down after being seasick on the starboard side , over the pump , in what had been Dottie 's safe place , and he was looking steadily away from the wind into the darkness off to the west . The girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensed a new direction , for Harmonywas not laboring now as she had been ; but Tom did notp178want to signal to them that they were headed out for the ocean . Let them deduce . Let them guess . Starting the descent of one long wave in a rush Tom was aware of a vibration which half way down the slope presented itself as a deep thrumming . He could not be sure whether he heard it or felt it . It seemed to be a sound . It stopped as they climbed the next sea and did not sound again until several rises later when Harmony plunged down another particularly long and precipitous swell . It was a beautiful deep humming harmonic sound . Something about the engine  --  a bearing at play ? The wind in the rigging ? Was it a song of the shrouds and stays and halyards ? Had Harmony become a huge Aeolian harp ? No , this was no such light music as that . This had a resonance , a deep-chested sound , as if from beneath , as though the hull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only on the swift , planing dives . It was a lovely sound  --  if it was in fact a sound rather than a feeling . Tom heard it or felt it when it came and enjoyed it as a diversion in this soaked chaos . It made him think of myths and mysteries of the sea  --  of Odysseus with a god 's gift of storm winds trapped in leather bags and tied with a shining silver wire , of Argonauts pulling at fifty oars , of Poseidon 's voice , of mermaidsand sailors ' heartbreak , of Jonah in the cavern of archingribs , of sirens on ship-killing rocks  --  and these relieved his mind for a short while of its awe , which was worse than fear . Lovely sound , basso pro fundo . " Down at the bottom of the sea " . . . He thought it weird and magical . But before long even this music of his boat communing with the deeps passed into the general noise of the storm and became commonplace , and there was nothing left to Tom but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of beingp179all mixed up in time , as one is after a trans-Atlantic flight on a jet , and a bone-weariness that could not be admitted even to himself , to say nothing of the awareness , which he had brought into the storm , of being alone , all alone . He steered the yawl . He dared not look at his watch for fear it might be going backwards . Was he sailing into the past ? Would that make things better ? Now at last , within a short span that would have been hard to measure in minutes or miles , a sea-change took place so vast and radical that Tom knew he was , all over again , for the nth time on this one day , suffering the shock of birth from a safe and protected place into an outer world of more profoundtruth . If there had ever been a Block Island , Harmony was now moving out from under its lee . There was nothing essentially new outside ; it was simply that having lost a sense of time one now felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whack . Harmony was shrinking . Tom could not bear to think of waves as big as these were getting ; he preferred to think of his own diminution . They were outside in the realms of hugeness now , no question about it . He decided to try going down wind . Perhapsthat would be easier than fighting his way up these mountains of wet wrath . Running more with the waves would carry Harmony away from the island ; he would keep edging out to sea . They would be going down where Flick kept staring . Tom signalled with a hand to the two exposed faces : a turn . Audrey smiled . Tom realized it was not the first time she had smiled . She had smiled quite often when she had caught his eyes . But what was the meaning of her smiling now when with a turning fish-swim of a hand motion he announced the coming change of course ? Was she encouraging him , or wasp180she smiling because she had realized all along that he was out of his mind ? Did n't she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What business had she to smile at him any more ? At first Tom eased the wheel and then he spun it fast as he came to see that he must swing Harmony as quickly as possible in order to avoid her being broached and swamped in these waves . There ! My God ! Look at her go now with both wind and sea following , and hear her making that deep thrumming all the way ! The girls , turning to him , had suddenly put on rollercoasterfaces . They were opening their mouths  --  squealing , no doubt . Flick ? Still staring off to starboard . Did he know he was looking in a new direction ? Except for the great relief of having the wind out of his face , it was harder for Tom this way , not easier . Everything was headlong and too swift . Fleeing down the enormous waves that were themselves in flight , Harmony tucked down her fat bow and lifted her duck-bottom stern so high that the rudder kept almost no bite at all , and when she reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white torso to one side or the other without regard for the skipper 's wishes , and this sudden wallowing skid would make her roll onto her beam ends and ship green water even over her high coaming ( Flick sat there impassively as water scooped into his lap ; the girls held on with straight arms , ducking their heads , looking at Tom ) ; and then she would make the slower way up the steep slopes , hanging , the wave careening along too fast to be easily mounted , and at last she would reach the crest , where a constantly self-renewing breaker boiled along , and she would veer wildly in that froth as if in the rapids of a river , out of control , then down she would start to schuss again , with thatp181towering overcurve of the breaker threatening to pounce on her from astern , and down she would rush , burrowing her nose , down , down , toward that dizzying lurch at the bottom . There on a wavetop was Audrey smiling . Torn did not expect any more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was this some abstract force of womanhood showing itself , a mother instinct more powerful even than chaos , and having not much really to do with its object ; the ultimate feminine self-love in the encouraging curve of those lips ? She was not his , but she wanted , even here , to make him hers . To possess him by taking care of him . As though by her smile she was conning him and his toy boat through the most precipitousperils . . . And down , down the sailboat plunged . Torn was sharply conscious of two dangers  --  not that he feared them , exactly , for out here all that adrenalin could do for a man was being done , and all emotions were being put , like all muscles , to work : the danger of being pooped from astern by one of those rollers breaking along the tops , and the danger of wallowing over so far in one of the troughs as to backfill the exhaust right over its looping water trap and thus to kill the engine . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had often read about the miraculous effect on following combers of such a tiny thing as a long length of line . But he did not see how he could spare the time or strength  --  for he was alone now , alone with this storm and that smile  --  strength both to hold with one hand to the wheel , which despite the evident loss of control by the rudder tugged this way and that with astonishingferocity , and with the other hand to fetch a line from the lazuret behind him and feed it out astern ; too many problems of strength and balance . And in time he observed that in anyp182case each breaker held its place at the top of the wave , and that the great structure of the wave itself never came toppling down . What had happened to the proportion of things ? How insignificant Harmony had become , what a gnat  --  or louse  --  Tom was now ! Did he think that Audrey and Flick had made him feel small the afternoon before , when he had tapped that look of theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no bigger than the tiniest grain of sand , and worth no more . How gross the seascape was ! The spray from those breakers astern , when she was half way down a wave , seemed to be leaping over the spreaders more than half way up the mainmast , and when Harmony fell into the out-of-control squirming of her consternation at the foot of one of those troughs and Tom looked up and around , he found her in a bowl of raging water , an amphitheater with steepest galleries , the topmost of which seemed to tower over the windvane at the head of the mast , which he knew to be thirty-eight feet high , and again when , a few seconds later , she trembled at a crest in the froth of a breaker reaching up her flanks with its willful steel fingers deceitfully camouflaged by millions of soft white bubbles , she seemed to be on a pinnacle , an Alp of water capped with snow white , commanding a peak 's panoramaif one could overcome his vertigo and look , and yet again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom looked ahead and downward , he half expected the sea to part down there at the bottom , to open up all the way down to sand and rocks bearded with glistening kelp and barnacled shells and fishes flapping and gasping on dry land and green lobsters scrambling in tenor across the open place seeking the cover of the salt sea . But Tom had begun to distrust his eyes ;  |p183the  borderline between seeming and being was growing vague . That smile of Audrey 's seemed as vast as the gap between two of these hurricane-built seas . Did he exaggerate those waves , that indulgent molding of her lips  --  or , thinking of himself , of his own heart , did he minimize , cut himself down too far ? Time was shot to hell  --  was space going , too , especially the space filled by the self ? His loss of Audrey was beyond belief ; was he losing his perception of heights and depths , and of how far it was from wavetop to wavetop , or from fingertip to fingertip , heartbeat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Had he really lost his wife ? Or even his life , in the terms in which he had recognized existence before seeing these seas and that smile ? Or his mind ? His mind ? Now came an event to test his perceptions . Near the top of one of these gigantic waves a smaller wave climbing the bigger one 's back came charging , with sudden fury , at Harmony , and it slapped her with the brute strength that water possesses in more abundance than any other element , even fire , and Harmony jumped suddenly , bucking so hard in pain and annoyance that the life ring , a canvas-sheathed cork doughnut with the name of the yawl painted on it in blue block letters , burst its marlin lashings and leaped right out of its cloth cradle slung between the mizzen shrouds quite close to where Tom sat , and flipped overboard into the sea . It flashed astern , yanking after it the coiled lifeline that one hoped would be long enough in an emergency  --  and snaked it clean away . The ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to tell himself that nothing more than an idea had fallen overboard . A life ring would be meaningless in this water  --  and that was the very essence of the trouble out here . All the usual meanings of objects , of words , which could no longer bep184heard anyway , of persons , who could no longer be reached , except perhaps by smiling , of relationships between persons and objects and , alas , between persons and persons  --  all the usual meanings were distorted here . The apparent distortions of time and of scale had made all that should seem familiar seem , to the contrary , unreal , senseless , broken down , moribund , totally gone to pieces . At the crest of a wave Tom had a vision of his telling a lie to Audrey . This had happened ; or at least he believed it had happened . It had been such a stupid , bizarre , pointless , ridiculouslie . He had come home late . He had in fact been at the hospital ; a man named Smallens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restaurant in Jersey some clams that must have had their beds in a boardinghouse of ordure at the gate of a suburban sewer , because the man 's liver at once became an inferno , had detained him with endless arguments  --  on top of everything else the man was a lawyer  --  about the treatment Tom had prescribed for him . This had put Tom in a crazy mood , and when he got home to a spoiled supper and four tight guests he told Audrey that he had had to have a long consultation with a lawyer because some nutty girl whom he had examined several months before in the presence of Miss Slattery had now slapped a paternity suit on him , alleging that he had , as she put it in her complaint , " molested her " on the examining table . What ever made him tell such a story was beyond him at the time  --  unless it had to do with some suppressed impulses with respect to female patients which he had never clearly admitted to himself ; he had had to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settling the mess out of court , keeping the scandal from getting in the papers , steadying the nerves of the lawyer who wasp185overly fearful for Dr. Medlar 's reputation . He saw himself now , beckoning Audrey out of the living room and along the hall to the bedroom , whispering the story to her so the guests would not hear it  --  and now in the hurricane he was suddenly caught by a grotesque gap in the memory . He could not remember whether the Hamdens were guests that evening . Maybe  --  he recalled Dottie lying in her bikini on the sunheatedcushions , and how close he had come to a reckless theft  --  the lie had been the truth . It was he who had been unfaithful to Audrey , not the other way around . . . Down Harmony plunged on a dizzy descent . The whole world had become one great eye-fooler , and suddenly a large number of things  --  opposites that had dissolvedinto each other , paradoxes , lies that were truths , troughs that were crests , wests that were easts struck him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was humor but a sense of the incongruous , and what was this storm at play with Harmonybut a counter-clockwise turmoil of incongruities ? He threw back his head and roared at the big joke of Esme and what it was doing to his beliefs and perceptions ; the howler of Dottie and Flick and Audrey and the self , lovers and betrayers , out for a happy cruise in this storm . It was rich ! Tom 's ribs began to ache with the joy of the joke . But then he saw Audrey looking at him . It was clear that she could not hear his guffaws , for he could not even hear them himself in the crash of rain on his hood and the rush of the breakers and the moaning of the rigging and that baritone thrumming from down in the caverns of the sea , but she could see all too well the eruptions of the laughter at his mouth ; and she looked horrified . Her smile had been quick-frozen , and her eyes were full of suspicion . It was as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie was an everlasting truth . Which brought them , on a theme of lack of faith , around to Flick  --  and for Tom this intensified the joke . Flick was a lump . Flick just sat there and stared off to whatever offered itself as being the view to starboard . Dottie reached up and caressed the hair out of his eyes , and the sight of this gesture thawed the eternal smile on Audrey 's lips ; yes , the women would take care of him . It had turned out that this man who celebrated communication in all its most sophisticated forms had fallen into a profound silence , where he appeared to be utterly unreachable . All that waving of his arms , all that shouting and singing , which had looked so much like the ecstasy of a man throwing himself at life , taking delight in the tests of manhood  --  all that had proved to be some kind of ceremony of removal . It had been addressed to no one , not even to the bitch Esme . Now in this festival of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was precisely Flick 's impulse toward human silence that had made him become , in the first place , a technician of mechanical communication . All his devices would lead in the end to a deaf , dumb , and blind earth ; a desire for withdrawal , for separateness , for isolation , was at the root of his choice of a career devoted to soldered connections , circuitry , electronic computation , wiring , waves of energy reaching out into space and bearing coded messages . In medical school Tom had used to play a game of predicting students ' specialties  --  this man , with a childlike sweetness and deep nostalgia , bound to be a pediatrician ; this one , powerful and subtly cruel , a surgeon ; this one , a tiny bit sneaky where girls were concerned , a gynecologist . One could have known that Flick would choose to be a computer man of some sort ,  |p187for  what he really wanted was a vast network of silence . And now he was caught in it . In the height of the hurricane he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let the smiler have him . He was inert ; he would be a heavy weight on her hands , if not on her conscience . She had trained that smile on Flick now . She was going to take care of him . Yes , she really was : She was unsnapping her safety hook , and darting one look at the enormous seas she slipped to her knees on the cockpit deck and eased herself across the way and threw her arms around Flick 's legs and pulled herself up on him and sat beside him  --  between him and Dottie . She snapped herself into that intervening place . With one hand on the coaming she used the other to turn Flick 's head around toward her , and she beamed her smile into his face , and then she began a series of hand signals which Flick , with eyes that seemed to have scales over them , did not in the least comprehend , or even watch and follow . What was she trying to tell him ? Tom , who was having to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaping hollows of water , could not make it out himself . SuddenlyAudrey was standing over Flick , and she reached under his armpits , and she was lifting him , or trying to persuade him to rise . He did stand up , looking extremely dull , and Audrey hauled him toward the opposite side of the cockpit . What , Tom wondered , was this ploy  --  merely taking him away from Dottie ? Ah , delicious ! This was in the true spirit of Esme : She had unsnapped her safety belt but not his ! She was tugging ; he was anchored . They waltzed in mid-cockpit , hanging there from his harness like some grotesque him-and-her puppet . Dottie saw the difficulty , but not , for some reason , thep188humor of it , and she leaned forward and unsnapped her husband . Audrey and Flick fell in each other 's arms into the seat on the port side . Audrey attached the lump to the lifelines , and , his lips blue , downcast , shivering , holding on tight , he began at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crossed the cockpit on her knees again , raised the seat cover from a kneeling position , and  --  oh , God , this storm was confusing  --  began to pump . Tom felt a flash of triumph ; then he felt a spurt of guilt ; and then , flooded by a realization that in this storm of oppositesand paradoxes both feelings were fatuously inappropriate , he returned , as if homeward , to anger . But fear crept into the anger as he wondered what its object was . What could he be angry at ? At last he picked , of all targets , the most foolish : the storm . He was furious at its persistence , he raged at its strength . Grinding , he zeroed in on his loneliness and began in his anger to wonder what it was . His wife was no longer his ; his friend was no longer his ; goose pimples had prevented him from making Dottie his . Nobody was his . Was it then simply the non-functioning of the third-person masculine possessive pronoun that defined his loneliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain properties which were incidentally human ? Was there any difference between Flick 's isolation of silence and staring , and his , of having been dispossessed ? Audreyhad stopped pumping  --  was Harmony dry ? He could not tell . She had stopped . She was smiling at him again ; it was precisely the same smile as she had lavished on the lump ; it was the badge of her loneliness . Did she have an intention of coming over and lifting him , her husband , by the armpits andp189transplanting him in the cockpit so she could do what ?  --  get in the driver 's seat ? He would knock her down if she tried it ; he would belt her . She was no longer his , and he was damned if he would let her even try to make him hers . Then he knew why he was angry at the storm : Within its confusion all the assumptions of " this world , " all its values , all its pretenses , all its civilization  --  all had turned out to be false here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " nice , " and essentially unreal . Here the thrumming descent to the trough was a descent to the id . He would give Audrey a big poke in the chops if she started that armpit gambit . And yet  --  and here were the very liver and lights of his rage  --  he wanted to bring Harmony through . To what ? Surely not just to the eye of the storm . To what beyond , to what ? How could there be an end to this loneliness ? Toward what was he steering ? That was the mystery of mysteries  --  the enigma of his desire for life . This desire was , even now , very strong . He felt it in his shoulders , spinning the wheel to try to offset , by anticipating it , that sickening skid at the foot of the trough . He was too late ! The rudder was out of the water . He could feel the deck beneath him begin to rise and seem to twist . Seeming ! What was the difference between seeming and being ? His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . She could not decide which way to skid and roll . She was twisting her back . This must surely be the last plunge . This time she would dig her nose into the water ahead and with her enormous impetus she would drive down into it , scooping , burrowing , and she would simply turn turtle . A sea somersault . The masts would point downward , the glistening green keel would reach toward the sky.  |p190How  powerful , at this moment , in his head and chest and guts and loins , was that unaccountable desire ! Life ! Buoyancy ! A refusal to go under ! He stood up at the wheel . He could see that Harmony  --  brave Harmony !  --  had the same desire as he . By God , she did ! Green water curled at the cheeks , the bowsprithad plunged like a swordfish 's weapon into the flank of the foe , the prow was on the verge of plunging under and wore a mean collar of flying foam . Every influence of the hurricane was driving her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very edge of it ; she trembled and hummed . Her head was still up . Tom felt a slight tug at the rudder . He threw it , not knowing which way to commit his influence , to port . That way , if she answered , the exhaust would be pointing downward ( a detail ! details added up to the life force ! ) and the engine would be safe . For a long time she shuddered and thrummed , her bowsprit wholly covered . The first sign was an end to the thrumming , and he realized : it was the keel . The keel had taken hold , and the scooping rudder . Harmony shook her head . Before she turned she began to roll , and now Tom saw that the danger was that she would roll right over on her side . Yes , that was it : sidewise rather than head over heels . She began to sheer away from the solid mass of water ahead . Her masts , driven by both wind and the centrifugal impulse of the great skid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horizontal . Hooo-o-o ! What a surge ! Over , over . Here came the sea into the cockpit . Poor Dottie was alone on the lower side ; Tom , falling , saw her put her head down , and she disappeared . Then Tom was under water , somewhere near the wheel ; he had a hand on a spoke . And in that spoke he felt something . A trembling , a trying . Yes , yes ! His head came up . He was in ap191soaked heap on the cockpit deck . The cockpit was full . The masts were drawing big , slow , upward arcs on the sky . Dottie was beside him in the flooded cockpit , shoulder-deep , with eyes like painted saucers . And there were Flick and Audrey , still on the higher seat . She was smiling ; he was staring ; the world was right side up . And Harmony was going ahead up a riffled hill of grayish green . Slowly the water began to drain from the cockpit . Thank God , the cabin hatches were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was steady ! Tom knew she could not run before it any more ; that had been too close . Indeed he clearly knew now , with salt water nearly up to his knees , that he should have turned long since . Opposites ! The desire for life , the persistence in dangerous error . How could he have held a wrong course , running before the wind and waves , so long ? Had it really been necessary to keep moving out and out , away from shelter , toward the eye of the storm ? Yet here they were , here they still were . He put the wheel way down to port and began the overdueturn . He and his yawl were shot full of luck ; that was all he could think as , amid powers immeasurably greater than that of the tiny tab of tapered oak hinged to the rudder post , or of his weary hand wrapped around a thin spindle of mahogany , chance rather than judgment on his part chose just the right phase of a huge swell for her to swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind abeam , on the rise of the great hump , and by the time the crest came , with its curling and breaking comber , she was well up into the teeth of the blow . That was all very well : she had turned . But coming roundp192to face the wind brought , besides the breath-stealing fact of facing the wind , a new revelation with a new shock on its back . This was not going to be any better than going down wind . Indeed , he saw that he had sustained a new and frightfulloss : There was no longer any such thing , out here , as relativity . The concepts " better " and " worse " had lost their meaning ; faster and slower , bigger and smaller , more direct and more devious , and better and worse and worse and better  --  allgone . Here there was only one medium , driven wetness ; one temper , rage ; one condition of life , danger of a uniform density . Tom saw what he must do  --  or what he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made Tom distrust what he had considered his greatest strength of all , his ability to watch out for " things " ; he was tired , muddled , deprived of all the usual measures of decision , and it was hard to tell his beloved details from dreaded wholes . It seemed that he must wear off on a close reach , southwesterly in tendency , driving down away from the island ; that he must advance the throttle , take the prolonged risk of three thousand r.p.m. ' s ; that he must try to keep Harmony 's bows fairly well up into the wind by holding the helm far to leeward as she ran down a great sea-back and through the valley of skids and most of the way up the next oncoming mass ; but that then he must head her sharply up  --  the only way to do this being to ease the wheel to midships just before the crest and then whirl it back down again to make a kind of flapping fan of the rudder and so nudge her bow up  --  in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the boat moving by taking the wavetop fury equally down both flanks . So it seemed , and so he did , or thought he did . He thought he was doing . This was too hard . He was in ap193dream . There had been too much of seeming . One could not live without differentiations , one simply could not get along without being able to see outlines , borderlines , and without being able to feel more or less action in one 's arms . But there was an outline ! To windward . A heaviness , a bulk , a darker place . Was that a glimpse of Block Island ? If it was , then islands , like boats , could move in the sea , and Block Island , not Harmony , was out of place . Perhaps it was just a lowering bank of cloud . Surely she was well away from land by now ! There was a reality of something dark there , couching an illusion . Tom recognized now the final humiliation : not to be sure of anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse ? To be condemned to a monotony of this unsureness ? His hand , a glove-shaped bag of weakened sinews and many little bones , curling around a piece of wood ornately shaped on a lathe , repeating an identical action over and over again . Hold down , wait , ease up , whirl ; repeat ; repeat ; repeat . The waves had somewhat different shapes but uniform intent . One had to repeat the action , or else  --  cease repeating the action , cease being , cease seeming . Camus 's rendering of Sisyphus came to him , the aptest picture of modern man  --  in a hurricane wind . Tom was tempted to stop this repetition , for he felt that if Esme would take the hint and just stop on her side for five minutes , then he would be able to resume and carry on forever . But what was that concept that had sneaked into his mind ? Five minutes . Tom quickly looked at his watch and , without having taken in the message of the metal hands , he sensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? Flick was shaking . Monotony for him was to be an end/less existence of shivering . Smart bastard who liked to be rained on . ( There was a change ; a tremulous lightening of the weight of monotony . ) Tom could only see part of Flick 's profile as he maintained his fixated vigil to port : pale , except for the lips , which had a color of no good . The eyes were rapt ; they seemed to be reading in a fascinating book a single perfect sentence . But they were , at the same time , sound asleep to anything actual . After her pumping , Audrey had stayed in that corner of the cockpit , Dottie 's former safe place . Now she was steadily watching Flick 's trembling shoulders , just as hypnotized , in her way , as Flick in his . But there seemed now  --  Tom scanned her as he had his watch , without really taking in the message  --  some kind of imminence in her stare ; her private monotony was on some kind of verge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight change having set in , or being about to . And Dottie ? Too bad , no visible change there . She sat holding on with the weak hands of one who had regurgitated all energy , sick to emptiness of the sea 's anger yet somehow in love with it , watching with huge eyes , passive , helpless except for a tiny dampened spark still in her eye of her quarrel with Flick and of wanting to care for Flick , wanting to hand-brush the hair from his brow , or slap comprehension into his stare . And what about Harmony ? ( One certain change : a sharpened awareness in Tom , something making him look around again at " things , " even if he did not clearly understand them . ) Harmony was making that deep music all the time now , and even it could be said to have changed . On the edge of the thrumming there was a kind of fluttering , a soft throbbingas of the beating of wings or the trembling of the lull of a genoa jib in gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge to the sound ; that was a change . Then Tom realized it had stopped raining . He had no idea how long before . Raising his eyes as Harmony made a curvet on the summit of a wave , he saw a sharp horizon far away ; then the yawl was in a hollow and the horizon had leaped in heaving and high . He wondered , thinking of the vague illusion of imminent change he had had for some time , whether he had confused it all along with the reality of the stopping of the rain . Shadow and substance : he must have translated a cessation of the stinging of drops of storm-blown rain in his face into a mere sense of becoming , an anticipation . The danger , now , was inward : it was false interpretation . When a man looked at realities and saw chimeras , when he read past events as future promises , he was in a danger more profound than that of the closeness of death ; the danger was the horror of being alive and not knowing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he would with equal effort fight this awful danger . Item the first : look for Block Island . Harmony came up on top , and he looked in the direction of the dim shape he had seen , or imagined , a few centuries ( moments ) ago . There was nothing there . It had been a cloud , a fogbank , a dreamland . He looked back over his left shoulder to where the island actually should have been , and there it was . Anticipation and reality rejoined ! How far away ? Five miles ? What did it matter ? He could run to leeward forever in the new wind after the eye , to the Azores , to Portugal , to Casablanca ! Hooray for rocks and soil and sand and bayberry bushes , out of the way where they belonged ! But Block Island 's obliging location did not mean that the fight against the new danger was won ; for now came a new sensory dislocation . Tom saw that the rollers were no longerp196breaking along the tops of the waves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeating the robot ritual at the wheel , easing it up and whirling it down near the crests , to head up  --  into combers no longer there . He could steer a straighter course now . ' What else ? Look at the water ! What else ? Why , the vastness was still there , the awesomeness of immensity that made Tom think small , and there were still hard climbs to acrophobic nightmares and then plunges with the lance of the bowsprit aimed down to split the back-scales of slimy dragons of the unconscious crawling on the bottom of the sea  --  but see : the skin of the waves had changed . That urgent building of ripples on ripples was no longer going on ; the furious corrugation had stopped . For how long ? And what did the disappearance of the breakers and the smoothing of the complexion of the seas mean ? Translate with care , he told himself . These phenomena may have been there , or rather not there , for a long time , unobserved or misinterpreted . Be careful what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point there was a " thing " to be seen to . Harmony was going with more ease than  --  than in an earlier era  --  and he wanted to throttle down the engine to avoid overheating . This was a perfectly reasonableand necessary precaution . Bending down and watching the tachometer he pulled back the throttle : twelve hundred , and the thrumming still there but the fluttering gone . Yes , she held her own at twelve hundred . How could she ? That problem of the breakers . The problem of the ruffling-on-ruffling no longer there . The problem , now observed but not yet translated , of no more spume flying off every protuberance and wedge of water.  |p197All  right , one more practical move : If no more rain , why not take down the waterproof hood ? He hooked both knees over opposite spokes of the wheel and after some picking and tugging at the bowknot under his chin he loosened the drawstring of the hood and flipped his head bare . First things first : the thrumming . It was a sound , sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked and ears out in the open and hair free , Tom understood all those seen changes . The wind had dropped . There was almost no wind . An end had come to the wind . And as if this were an enlightenment in every sense , as if far more than a mere answer to riddles had dawned on Tom , the day was suddenly brighter . A strange glare , hard on eyes adjusted to the possibility that gloom would last forever , makingone squint at its unexpectedness , lay on the decks . Tom looked up and saw ahead a great curved gulf of blue sky . The thrumming sound was so much on his mind that it took him some time to feel that blueness as a hope of warmth . He was trying to remember : in that worst of all skids , when turning turtle had seemed a certainty , the first sign had been an end to the thrumming  --  and what had that meant ? There was blue sky ahead !  --  as blue as the rim of a summertimehigh , wafting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far to the north ; only this blue came , less honest , ringed with outrage , from the fetid south . The others should know about this . Tom looked to them , wanting to speak words for the first time in an age . But Flick and Audrey were interlocked , as surely as fornicating animals who get stuck in the act : he staring and shivering , she with that smile and that lookp198of inception . She was really about to do something for him . Let them be . There was always Dottie . " Look up there , " Tom said to her , and he pointed at the huge azure curve . Dottie looked , and then her eyes came back to his in gratitude and uncomprehending sweetness . And then , two or three score of huge seas later , in a fullness of kindly brilliance , out came the sun . Tom knew the meaning of everything now . Esme 's horrid eye was ogling them . They had made it to the eye . They had made it . Tom looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands had to say : It was exactly one-fifteen . He would remember that for the log . He would buy a new log book , even though this one was only half filled ; he could not keep looking at that cut-up endpaper . He 'd get a new one . Then he thought : Sufficient unto the day the winds thereof . Make no commitments for the future ; sign no contractstoday , buy no log books . Audrey was unbuckling . The sunlight was dazzling on her bulging orange life jacket over her orange slicker ; and a golden light was reflected up on her face , which was illuminated , too , by that look of maternal anticipation aimed at Flick . She undid her hood and shook out her hair , and then she stood unsteadily  --  Harmony was making good time , thrumming along and prancing like a bronco on the queerly unmotivatedyet still huge seas , which were now plum-colored and starred with sunglints  --  and she staggered , looking euphoric and a little foolish like a young girl who had had no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she crossed to Flick , whose back was still turned to the cockpit , and she triumphantly put her hands on his shaking shoulders.
