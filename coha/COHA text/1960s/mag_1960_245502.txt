The Apalachin raid was one of the most celebrated in U.S. police history : that spectacular occasion in November 1957 when New York State cops and federal agents picked up 63 high-muck-a-mucks of U.S. crimedom , all from one barbecue pit . That day , big-time hoods from as far away as Arizona and California arrived to roast steaks and toast marshmallows at the secluded estate of a beer distributor and longtime racketeer named Joseph Barbara . <P> <P> The gathering did indeed seem downright suspicious . And if only the captured guests had been willing to tell the real purpose of their conclave , the policemen 's lot would have been a happy one . As it was , many said that they had merely gone to visit the ailing Barbara , who has since died of heart trouble . Two said their car had broken down near by . Another swore that he had come to sell Barbara some fish . Barbara himself said that all the guests had been more or less unexpected - and he just happened to have about 200 pounds of steak on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Justice Department haled the lot of them before grand juries , and at length a U.S. District Court in Manhattan found 20 of them guilty of conspiring to obstruct justice by lying to the grand juries about their reasons for coming to Apalachin . <P> It was certainly an understandable temptation to throw the whole Apalachin crew into jail on general principles , but to many observers the convictions seemed a dangerous precedent . What the case added up to was legal incredulity at the notion that so many bums had gotten together for any innocent purpose . <P> Last week a U.S. Court of Appeals kicked the Government 's case clean back to the barbecue pit : the court , reversing the convictions of the 20 hoods , ordered the charges dismissed . The main point of the unanimous decision by the three judges : Since the Government had not tried to prove that the meeting , in and of itself , violated any state or federal law , how could it prove that the defendants had conspired to lie about their presence there ? The Government 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge J. Edward Lumbard , was wholly unwarranted . " Bad as many of these alleged conspirators may be , their conviction for a crime which the Government could not prove . . . and on evidence which a jury could not properly assess , can not be permitted to stand . " <P> <P> Judge Charles E. Clark , in a concurring opinion , had even harsher words for the prosecution . The case , he wrote , suggests that " the administration of the criminal law is in such dire straits that crash meth ods have become a necessity ... <P> " A prosecution framed on such a doubtful basis should never have been initiated or allowed to proceed so far . For in America we still respect the dignity of the individual , and even an unsavory character is not to be imprisoned except on definite proof of specific crime . "
