In a tavern in fifteenth-century Constantinople , two men from Normandy , GODFRIGH and BALDWIN , watch LEO , a Byzantine dancer . A ROBED MAN watches ; his face reflects the mood of the exotic music . Two Byzantine women , MARY and ZOE , watch also . GODFRIGH He could ram my wife in the armpit ! BALDWIN What ? GODFRIGH He could ram Alice , my wife , in the armpit ! BALDWIN What ? What do you mean ? GODFRIGH I mean if Alice was near him  --  look how he moves  --  some part of him would ram into her ! BALDWIN Are you kidding ? GODFRIGH Just let the schismatic try though  --  just let him try  --  I 'll cut off his balls ! BALDWIN O is that what rammed into her ? He 'd be a eunuch if you cut his balls off . It 's no crime in Constantinople , the Patriarch 's a eunuch . GODFRIGH He is ? But that 's not Christian ! That 's not human ! BALDWIN A eunuch 's just got scales where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How do you know he has scales ? BALDWIN Because I buggered one once . ( BALDWIN and GODFRIGH laugh ) GODFRIGH I wonder if the Patriarch 's been buggered , the Holy Father of the East . BALDWIN Probably  --  he 's Greek ! GODFRIGH ( Points to the ROBED MAN ) Always that same look , that same look of of . . . BALDWIN Superiority . GODFRIGH That 's right ! A look of superiority  --  like he could make gold out of piss ! ( ZOE and MARY give annoyed looks at GODFRIGH and BALDWIN ) ZOE Sirs , we are watching the young man dance ! MARY Your voices are interfering with the music  --  it will disturb the dancer ! GODFRIGH O we are very sorry , we are so very sorry . We are so new in fair Constantinople  --  we do n't know just how to behave . ( Winks at BALDWIN ) But tell us , is it right for women , obviously high-born women like yourselves , to watch a man dance ? p. 4 BALDWIN The ladies back home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very often with the belt and buckle on them . ZOE Belt and buckle ? MARY Belt and buckle  --  a chastity belt ? GODFRIGH That 's right  --  so we know that they might be faithful to us their Christian husbands ! ZOE But that is barbaric ! BALDWIN So is cutting off a man 's balls ! MARY Ahhhh  --  but that is a different thing , hereditary titles are kept in families that way . ZOE And did you know that some of our best military men are eunuchs ? It 's a myth that a eunuch has to get lethargic and fat ! And they are very patriotic ! MARY Constantinople 's eunuchs are indeed very patriotic ! Indeed , the whole Empire 's eunuchs ! BALDWIN Tell me , fair lady , are all the men in Constantinople eunuchs ? MARY O no , sir , not all the men  --  why just look at the dancer  --  he 's as whole as any man might be ! ZOE He moves so charmingly  --  he makes me feel like I have drunk an elixir ! O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! p. 5 MARY His beauty and vigor make me feel so happy ! GODFRIGH Might n't I be able to make you feel happy ? We could have some kebobs and hashish , then you could teach me how to dance , and then . . . MARY Then what , sir ? GODFRIGH Then we could fuck . MARY Fuck ? What  --  what does that mean ? I never heard the word fuck . I suppose it is a Latin word  --  it 's certainly not Greek ! BALDWIN ( Laughing with GODFRIGH ) Let me teach you a song , ladies  --  a song from the West ! ( He sings ) I love coffee I love tea I love the java and the java loves me coffee and tea the java and me a fucka fucka fucka fucka you ! ( MARY and ZOE try to sing ; BALDWIN is enunciating the words seriously ; GODFRIGH is laughing ; the ROBED MAN has a cynical look on his face . LEO stops dancing and looks furiously at them ) LEO ( Screaming ) You frustrated wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that word to these innocent women ! p. 6 BALDWIN ( Laughs ) Ca n't you take a good joke ? GODFRIGH By the Holy Father , the true representative of Christ  --  we were having a little fun  --  just a little fun ! LEO Is that what is called fun in the barbaric West ? Teaching women lewd colloquial words  --  ignorant nuts ! Boors ! GODFRIGH ( To BALDWIN ) Should I beat him ? Should I teach this heretic-pig how to bow ? BALDWIN Christ 's mother ! Let 's just take these two little ladies ! ZOE Take these two little ladies ! O no you wo n't ! MARY You are boors ! Leo is right ! You are boors boors boors ! ZOE Rough and stupid  --  boors ! MARY And animalistic  --  boors ! LEO See  --  we know who you are ! We Byzantines are sure of who and what you are ! And we know who we are ! BALDWIN We came here just to talk to some women and listen to some music  --  but you are making me itch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperial civilization  --  how to hail the Pope ! But first I want to soften the bones of his face ! ( GODFRIGH strikes LEO , who deftly darts about blocking the blows ; MARY and ZOE rush in front of LEO ) p. 7 MARY ( Screaming ) Do n't you touch him ! Leave him alone ! Keep away from him ! ZOE We 'll climb in your hair if you hurt Leo ! ( MARY and ZOE embrace LEO ; ZOE cries ) LEO ( To GODFRIGH and BALDWIN ) Your kind likes to see women cry ! ZOE Just me , Leo . I am the one who cries  --  Mary does not . MARY I do not cry because I am secure in your love , Leo . ( She grabs him ) ZOE Do you not love me , Leo ? LEO Mary and I are old friends , Zoe . ( GODFRIGH and BALDWIN watch in surprise ) ZOE But I know  --  I want you to dance with me , though . LEO Mary and I are old friends . We want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutching too . LEO has his arms around both , but he yields to MARY more ; ZOE presses against him ) ZOE I think you must think I 'm a . . . p. 8 LEO Why do you do this ? ZOE I think I 'm going to cry again . Do you want me to cry ? LEO No . MARY ( To ZOE , surprised at her emotion ) You are romantic ! ZOE I ca n't help it . I ca n't help the way I feel about Leo . LEO I know I 'm sexy . ZOE O it 's not just sex  --  a lot of men are sexy . LEO They are ? ZOE But you have a sweetness . . . MARY ( Takes off her shoes ) I want to dance , Leo . I want you to teach me the new Syrian dance ! ( LEO and MARY start to dance ) ZOE ( Takes off her shoes ) I have got my shoes off too , Leo . I want to dance too ! MARY Stop your ranting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go away . ZOE You fat cat  --  I wo n't go away ! LEO I do n't like insults , Zoe  --  you 've insulted Mary ! p. 9 ZOE I do n't care  --  I do n't care ! ( She screams and dives into MARY . The two fight . LEO goes to separate them ) LEO You are acting like the Frankish women ! Like cats in heat ! Stop fighting stop fighting stop fighting ! ( LEO cries ; the women stop fighting and tenderly look at him . They put their arms around him and each other . The ROBED MAN watches them ) @x In the bedroom of GODFRIGH 's wife , ALICE . She is with her friend , GERTRUDE . ALICE Sometimes when Godfrigh was so lightheaded from the mead  --  he 'd tell his filthy jokes  --  and then he 'd begin to stare  --  at my armpits ! GERTRUDE Maybe he had a thing with armpits . Did he tell jokes about armpits ? ALICE Yes ! All of them , evil jokes ! GERTRUDE Tell one ! ALICE You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALICE O it 's stupid ! Well  --  but it 's so stupid ! I could never understand why it was so funny to him . One time there was a woman who was all lopsided . Her ears were set wrongly and her nose was where her mouth should be and vice-versa . So this woman went to bed with a man and when she undressed the man laughed and she got angry and she said if you do n't stop your laughing I 'll pee on you , whereupon she lifted up her arm and peed on him . GERTRUDE Bizarre ! ALICE Yes , I think so too ! You know , he never wanted me to shave my legs ! I am not a hairy woman . . . p. 11 GERTRUDE I am not either . ALICE But the little I do have , he said that I should keep  --  I did n't like that ! I like my legs to be smooth ! GERTRUDE Me too . ALICE He 'd tell me about the Byzantine women and how hairy some of them were  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GERTRUDE Ugh ! ALICE ( Bitterly ) He never appreciated my smoothness . GERTRUDE I hear some of these Eastern women rub chalk on their bellies to make them whiter ! ALICE I am not at all surprised , they do and know a lot of ways to please a man  --  and then after forty years of fucking and sucking  --  they join a convent  --  become nuns ! GERTRUDE They are a superstitious bunch . ALICE And their murky intrigues ! Their rotten double-dealings . The Empress Irene putting out the eyes of her own son ! GERTRUDE And they look down on us ! We are called the barbarians ! ALICE I hate the guts of Constantinople ! I knew a Bulgar man once  --  and he said that Constantinople and the whole empire would be destroyed by God ! p. 12 GERTRUDE Like Sodom and Gomorrah ! ALICE Now some of the Byzantine men are quite nice , though  --  they have a sweetness . GERTRUDE I guess there 's always some good among the bad  --  It 's the women I hate ! ALICE The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are different from our men of the West . GERTRUDE And they have such beautiful eyes and such charming manners . And how they dance ! And I 've never seen one drunk ! ALICE Yes  --  the men are quite nice . One of them once said to me , his name is Leo , " Alice , you chew food like a woman , your jaw moves so beautifully as you chew . " We were having dinner of roasted lamb , when he said that . " Alice , I am deathless when I am near you , " he said . GERTRUDE Lovely , lovely  --  that 's something Godfrigh would never think of saying  --  that 's poetry ! ALICE His face is so beautiful , Leo 's . Do you know he modeled for one of the great Armenian artists ? He was Saint George with a golden halo around his head  --  his sweetness . GERTRUDE I like a man to be sweet . p. 13 ALICE Well , Leo is very sweet  --  he 's ninety-nine and three quarters percent why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were n't for him I 'd have made Godfrigh send me home a long time ago . Do you know that when I first met Leo  --  during one of our little talks  --  he looked at me and said that he imagined my belly as being as smooth as the statue of Aphrodite . Leo never said it , but I think he does n't like hairy women  --  the opposite of Godfrigh , who thinks the hairier the better ! GERTRUDE Perverted , perverted ! ALICE One time Godfrigh made me wear a pair of little Slavic fur pants ! GERTRUDE To keep you warm ? ALICE To get him hot ! GERTRUDE Weird , weird ! ALICE Hair , fur , fuzzy things , and he bragged about it  --  he said a man should be unique ! GERTRUDE A pair of little Slavic fur pants  --  and that made him hot  --  when you wore it ? ALICE O , yes . GERTRUDE No wonder he wo n't leave Byzantium  --  all these hairy women around ! p. 14 ALICE That 's right , plus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Then he 'll go to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage  --  and get his sins forgiven ! GERTRUDE O no , not that again ! I 've heard that story a hundred times  --  they all say it , all the knights  --  that they 'll fight the Saracens for the sake of the Holy City  --  but they never go ! ALICE Why should they ? Here is where the fun and riches are ! Hypocrites , what hypocrites ! Jerusalem is always a pretext for getting to Constantinople ! GERTRUDE Nothing like a holy reason for a sinning need . By the way , where is Godfrigh ? ALICE O , he went with Baldwin and some Armenian to one of the provinces  --  about buying some shrine . A shrine ! Can you imagine ! GERTRUDE A shrine ? You mean , a holy place ? ALICE Exactly ! One of the eastern provinces  --  I forget which one  --  is having a commercial boom ; thousands of merchants from all over the world are pouring in . Godfrigh thinks buying a shrine and some land would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich  --  you know  --  selling relics ! GERTRUDE Ohh  --  well these Easterners are very religious . p. 15 ALICE Religious hah ! Fanatical ! And they love relics . Give them a cruddy toe , say it came from the corpse of Saint Christodulus or somebody , and they 'll eat it up with devotion ! Any dribbling beggar might be a saint  --  as long as he 's filthy enough ! GERTRUDE Disgusting ! ALICE These schismatics are no better than Moslems or Jews ! Gertrude , I really must attend to some business now . . . GERTRUDE Of course  --  I have visited much too long already . Adieu . ALICE Adieu . ( GERTRUDE exits . ALICE takes off her dress , puts on a filmy thing , and primps . LEO enters ) O my sweet prince of the East ! I am so glad thou hast come to me ! LEO I 'm glad that you asked me , Alice . ( LEO kisses her ) ALICE I love to feel your shoulders , your arms  --  and thou hast such beautiful eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes  --  it 's the make-up . I have n't had a chance to take it off  --  just left the tavern a little while ago . ALICE How many women were following thee while thou were walking to me  --  three , four ? p. 16 LEO No women followed me , Alice . ALICE O , I 've heard about thee  --  how thou hast all the women and the virgins burning for thee ! LEO Rumors ! Do n't talk with thees and thous . ALICE Why ? ( They kiss ) LEO Because they sound silly . ALICE Do n't hurt my feelings , Leo . I want to use them  --  it seems right with you . O , when I see you I can not help but know why women love you ! I can not help but want to say the words from " The Song of Songs . " ( She recites ) " O to feel the kiss of thy lips for thy love is better than wine ! Sweet to the smell are thine ointments ; thy name is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! O take me away ! Let us hasten that my King may bring me to his room . There in gladness and joy of thee we will extol thy love more than wine . How right they are to adore thee ! " ( They kiss , and drink wine ) LEO You know , Alice , sometimes women only want the outside of a man  --  like his bone structure . . . p. 17 ALICE ( sexy ) . . . and his lips and his hips and his long . . . eyelashes . LEO I do n't have a cloven hoof ! ALICE What do you mean ? LEO I am not just full of lust  --  and you do have a husband . ALICE So ? LEO Thou shalt not covet another man 's wife . ALICE O sweetheart , I am coveting thee ! ( They kiss ; GERTRUDE 's voice is heard offstage ) GERTRUDE 'S VOICE Alice , it 's Gertrude . I 've forgotten my parasol ! ALICE ( Angry ) O  --  well  --  why did you forget it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters , sees LEO and grins ) Leo , this is Gertrude . LEO Hello , Gertrude . GERTRUDE Hello , Leo  --  why you look like  --  why you look like Saint George ! ( ALICE frowns ) LEO I am not half as holy . ( LEO smiles ) p. 18 GERTRUDE I should hope not  --  and he was probably a eunuch . ( She winks ) LEO And I am not . GERTRUDE O I should hope not . ( ALICE gets the parasol and hands it to GERTRUDE ) ALICE Well  --  here 's your parasol , Gertrude  --  take it and leave ! GERTRUDE O I want to talk with you and Leo a little while  --  and I 'm quite tired . I had to walk all the way home before I realized I was lacking something . . . my parasol . ( GERTRUDE gives LEO a sexy look ) LEO You are not acting friendly , Alice . Gertrude should stay and rest a while . She looks so pale . GERTRUDE I am so fair too . . . . O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed and lies down ) O Alice , I would love a little wine  --  this heat of Constantinople . Please , a little wine . ALICE No wine for Gertrude . LEO What ? Of course wine for Gertrude ! ( LEO pours wine and hands it to GERTRUDE ) p. 19 GERTRUDE Cranky , cranky Alice  --  poor Alice wears such tight girdles  --  they give her headaches . ALICE You did n't have to say that ! GERTRUDE I wanted Leo to know the reason for your rudeness , Alice . When we know a reason for a thing  --  then we can understand it . LEO Is it the tight girdles that give you headaches , Alice ? ALICE No ! It 's not the tight girdles ! And goddamn it , I wear only one at a time ! And now I 'm not wearing any ! LEO Alice  --  what has gotten into you ! GERTRUDE Headaches , she gets headaches  --  they make her irrational ! ALICE Irrational ! You itching bitch ! Get out of my bed ! ( She lunges at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting . LEO tries to stop them ) LEO ( Shouting ) Stop it , mad women ! Hashish-mad females ! Crazy women ! Stop it ! Stop it ! ALICE ( Screaming ) Get out , Gertrude ! Get out ! Get out ! Get out ! p. 20 GERTRUDE Do n't think I wo n't ! You 're sick ! ( She gets up , tidies herself and leaves ) ALICE ( hysterical ) Malicious obscene cat ! Ohhhhhhhh ! LEO All right , pomegranate  --  I saw through her . . . ALICE You did ? Then why did you encourage her ? LEO O , I did n't realize . . . ALICE Did n't realize ? What ? LEO Well , women sometimes baffle me  --  I try to be helpful and then something always happens . ALICE ( Crying ) O my nose  --  she hurt my nose ! LEO O poor little pomegranate . . . ALICE My nose , my nose , it hurts ! LEO Yes , sweet one  --  your nose hurts  --  but it will feel better  --  Leo will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  make it better . ( He kisses her nose ) O I want some hashish , mmmmm , hashish . LEO Leo will give his little pomegranate some hashish  --  in just a minute . p. 21 ALICE In just a minute ! The blessed Virgin ! My husband might be back in just a minute ! LEO He might ? O the blessed Virgin ! ( LEO runs to the door ) ALICE ( Laughing ) No , no Leo  --  I am pretending ! It 's exciting to me  --  to feel that at any minute  --  my husband might walk in ! And find us fucking , or just about to ! LEO Pretending  --  you mean he wo n't be back any minute ? ALICE ( Laughing ) No , Leo , no  --  He 's far away ! LEO Funny , so funny . ALICE O I am not just laughing because of the funniness . I am laughing because of the excitement ! The excitement ! The excitement ! LEO ( Tired ) How many times are you going to repeat the word excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O I 've thought of it so many times ! You and I in the act !  --  and then somebody walks in ! LEO First you talk about your husband walking in  --  and now it 's somebody walking in . Soon it 'll be anybody walking in ! p. 22 ALICE That 's right , Leo ! Anybody walking in while we were in the act ! Anybody would be very exciting  --  for me and for you ! LEO Are you kidding ? I 'm not nuts ! You know , I really think you 're nuts ! I think Gertrude must have hurt your brains and not just your nose ! ALICE ( Laughing ) Gertrude  --  now if she had come while we were making love  --  then I would n't have gotten mad . Anybody will do  --  anybody will give me this excitement , as long as they have eyes to watch us ! LEO Watch us ? ALICE Watch us fucking ! O do n't be so innocent  --  people liking to be watched is no new thing . The old Romans watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy ! I do n't understand  --  I really do n't understand you  --  and to be very truthful , I wish I were in Egypt now  --  far away from you ! ALICE ( Grabs him ) O do n't say that ! Do n't say that ! Do n't ever say you want to be far away from me ! LEO The things you are saying  --  I feel as though ants are crawling on me ! People watching us while we 're fucking , Gertrude , somebody , anybody , old Romans . . . p. 23 ALICE All right , Leo  --  forget it ! Just some silly ideas  --  reading Ovid  --  he talks about things like that . . . LEO No he does n't ! Ovid never talks about being watched while love-making  --  and you know it ! You just made that up ! ALICE All right ! I made it up ! LEO Now why , Alice , why do you say things like that ? ALICE Ooo I do n't know . Darling , I 'm tired . Do n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sweet and hold me . ( Embraces him ) Leo , now sing to me  --  sing to me the newest chant from Syria . ( He sings ) Now let 's make love  --  without being watched . ( They kiss ) @x In a dismal ugly tavern . GODFRIGH and BALDWIN are drinking wine ; the ROBED MAN is there ; soft music plays . BALDWIN If we do n't get a disease by the time we leave Constantinople  --  I 'll think it 's a miracle ! GODFRIGH Why ? BALDWIN This place ! This tavern is one of the filthiest in Constantinople ! Why do we come here ? Why are you always making me sit here with you ! GODFRIGH Do n't put everything on me  --  you want to get riches too  --  you want to make an eventual pilgrimage to the Holy City too ! BALDWIN What has that to do with this disgusting place ? GODFRIGH I 'll tell you  --  this place has a lot to do with what we want  --  namely riches ! BALDWIN O yes  --  and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Armenians are the best businessmen ? BALDWIN Well , what does that have to . . . GODFRIGH Just answer my question  --  are the Armenians good businessmen ? p. 25 BALDWIN Yes , and so are the Greeks ! GODFRIGH Well , Beshar the Armenian  --  you met him the other day  --  said that if we really want to attract people to the shrine , we should have a real live saint ! BALDWIN A what ? GODFRIGH A living saint ! BALDWIN Yes  --  ahah ! A saint ! GODFRIGH I am very serious . A saint to attract people to my shrine . BALDWIN Our shrine ! My money 's in this venture too . GODFRIGH That 's better . Our shrine . The Easterners , as you are well aware of by now , are wild about holiness ; they love convents , monasteries , nuns , priests , ascetics and saints ! BALDWIN Where are we going to find a saint ? GODFRIGH In this place  --  this filthy place . Her name is Saint Mary of Egypt  --  Beshar said she comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . BALDWIN We are ? GODFRIGH Yes , but she must not know that we want to exploit her for commercial gain  --  otherwise she will never agree to come with us  --  she must not find out that she herself will be the draw of people 's money  --  she must think that the shrine is her sanctuary and not a place of business  --  our business . We 'll have lots of things lying around  --  bits of the true cross , pieces of cloth from the garments of Jesus and his apostles  --  umm , fingers , toes , hunks of hair  --  Mary will go around touching all these things  --  and people will buy anything that she happens to touch ! Think of all the relics we could sell  --  that Saint Mary of Egypt has touched ! ( ST . MARY OF EGYPT enters , dressed in a hair shirt , arms and legs hairy . She swings a bell ) p. 26 BALDWIN ( Whispers surprise ) Holy Mother ! GODFRIGH Son of Mary ! SAINT MARY OF EGYPT ( Chanting ) Saracens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I hid Saracens never sucked at these teats  --  I hid from them Unbelievers never touched me Unbelievers never touched me Unbelievers never sucked at these teats  --  I hid from them Virgin I am  --  virtuous I am Holy Holy I am , give money to Saint Mary of Egypt the pure one She who will get you in heaven with a prayer ! She who will ask Christ Pantocrator to smile on you ! Christ Pantocrator who never smiles will smile on you  --  because of Saint Mary of Egypt ! Earthquakes swallowed up the Saracens after they looked upon Mary 's white body  --  Saint Mary 's still a virgin so give her some money . ( She goes to the table . The ROBED MAN gives her a coin ; she approaches GODFRIGH and BALDWIN ) BALDWIN Here , pure mother . ( BALDWIN gives her a coin ) p. 27 GODFRIGH Pray for us , mother . ( Gives her a coin ) Share some wine with us , little mother . BALDWIN Share our table with us  --  we who will go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF EGYPT You will go to the blessed city and on the first day you will kill six hundred Saracens ! On the second day , seven hundred Persians ! On the third day , four hundred Turks ! On the fourth day , three hundred monophysites ! And on the fifth , sixth and seventh days you will kill all the Moslems and Jews ! ( ST . MARY gives long , gasping laughter ) BALDWIN Jerusalem for Christians ! GODFRIGH Jerusalem for Christ 's followers ! SAINT MARY OF EGYPT ( Breathes heavily ) I 'll sit down with you now , eat some bread , drink some wine , Christ 's blood is wine , you know , his fair flesh whiter than bread , you know , his toe clutches the heart of the world , the ends of his hair tickle the face of God , wine , wine , the first drink I 've had this morning is this sip of wine , bread , bread , the first bite I 've had this morning is this bread .

SAINT MARY OF EGYPT With your wives ? Have you brought your wives ? Constantinople 's good for a wife , so many churches , good for a wife to be in the church , Constantinople 's full of churches , wives should be in the churches . GODFRIGH Little mother , my wife is with me  --  and she is always in church ! SAINT MARY OF EGYPT Is she an Eastern Christian ? GODFRIGH No  --  far we are Western Christians , little mother . We heed the Pope . SAINT MARY OF EGYPT You 're Christians all the same , West , East , Pope , no hope , who will judge the separation between East and West ? Certainly God will , but we can not with our human tongues say that we will judge whether the East is right or the West , I myself am a Greek though my grandfather was a Hittite , I follow the wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews , ever since Christ saved me I wait to hear it from him , what the truth is , he tells me every night in my dreams , in my coffee cups , one time I turned my coffee cup over and I saw the image of God , he was in the form of a bear , but I knew it was God because there , in the middle of the bear 's forehead , was the cross ! A cross burning in the head of a bear ! p. 29 GODFRIGH A cross in the head of a bear ! SAINT MARY OF EGYPT Yes , in the head of a bear , and I knew what it meant , a bear sways when he walks , his feet press hard the earth 's floor , he is brown like the earth , he smells like the earth , and so I knew that the bear symbolized the world , and the cross symbolized God , and the world and God were one !

GODFRIGH ( Screaming ) Saracens ! We are impatient to get to Jerusalem ! To rid the Holy City of the heathens ! BALDWIN How I must get to Jerusalem  --  to walk where the Son of God walked  --  to kill his killers ! SAINT MARY OF EGYPT His killers , the Jews , they had the chance to know him but they knew him not , they had the chance to kiss him but they kissed him not , but Judas kissed him with betrayal , kissed God 's son with his evil lips , beware of red-haired men , they are the sons of Judas ! I saw a redhaired Saracen on an Aegean island where I hid , I became very afraid because I knew he would try to kiss me if he found me , the kiss of betrayal ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find me because I hid from them , Saracens never touched me , never touched Saint Mary of Egypt 's sweet body . p. 30 GODFRIGH Little mother , you hid on an Aegean island , from the Saracens ? SAINT MARY OF EGYPT Pirates , Saracen pirates , but I escaped from them , God made one of the Aegean islands come up under me in the middle of the sea , there I was , the only one on the island , the Angel Gabriel brought me some rice and fish in a silver bowl , the rice lasted six years short of six months , the fish lasted seven years , God had provided for me until the Byzantines found me , naked I lived on the island , naked I was when they found me , covered with hair and dirt , my nails long as a dragon 's , my teeth black like tar , but my breath was as sweet as a baby 's ! GODFRIGH Did you say you were covered with hair ? SAINT MARY OF EGYPT Ahhh yes  --  this hair shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own body . GODFRIGH It is ? SAINT MARY OF EGYPT Ahhh yes  --  and you should have seen my legs . . . GODFRIGH I should have ? SAINT MARY OF EGYPT They thought I was an animal so hairy was I  --  I looked as though I was covered with black fur ! GODFRIGH Black fur ! I would not have thought you were an animal  --  I would have known you were a woman . p. 31 SAINT MARY OF EGYPT I did look like an animal , an animal with dark hair , breasts , arms , legs , belly , covered with hair , dirty hair ! GODFRIGH You never washed ? SAINT MARY OF EGYPT Never  --  it was my choice ! Mortification for the son of God ! I never washed nor cut my hair , there were sharp stones I could have cut my hair with , but I chose not to for his sake ! For the sake of the Son of God ! GODFRIGH ( Excited ) Do you know , Saint Mary  --  I love hairy women ! BALDWIN ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , but Godfrigh , I think the little mother should know of the holy place . The shrine ! GODFRIGH O , yes , the shrine . Because we love the Lord and our Christian faith , the Lord has chosen us to do his work , Saint Mary of Egypt . And so he has made a way for us to serve him . He led us to sanctified ground where a miracle happened in the tenth century . A cruel Turk , a pagan , turned Christian , because of the love of a woman , a Christian woman who became a saint so much like you , pure mother . We have built a shrine on that holy ground . But , alas , it needs the blessed feet of a child of Christ to walk upon it , the holy ground . It needs the feet of Saint Mary of Egypt ! It needs the feet of St. Mary of Egypt to press into its sacred earth ! p. 32 SAINT MARY OF EGYPT The feet of me  --  ahh , yes  --  and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these feet .
