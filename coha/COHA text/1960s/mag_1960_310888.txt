The opera was so old that musicologists are not even sure of its history . The theater was equally ancient . But last week this antique combination made the liveliest show in Sweden . II Maestro di Musica , a broadly farcical opera buffa ( a pastiche partly based on a 1737 comic opera by Pietro Auletta ) , filled the Drottningholm Court Theater , built in 1766 during the reign of Queen Lovisa Ulrika . U.S. and European visitors to Stockholm 's talent-packed summer music festival learned at first hand why the Swedes are making a new mark for themselves in opera as they already have in movies . <P> In II Maestro , and II Barbiere di Si-viglia , Giovanni Paisiello 's rowdy comic version of the famed tonsorial tale , skilled young soloists-their names still little known abroad-testified to Drottningholm 's success in developing new operatic singers . Night after night S.R.O . crowds came back for more . <P> Flexible &; Functional . They came as much to see the sights as they did to hear the music . Only a few yards from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 20 minutes from downtown Stockholm , the long green lawns and fountains surrounding the theater set it centuries back in time . The building is still owned by the royal family . It has never been damaged , changed or remodeled , and some of its 400 seats still bear the name plates of Queen Lovisa 's household staff ( King 's Great Watch in the front rows , palace kitchen wenches in the rear ) . <P> Decorated with lacelike rococo friezes and 17th and 18th century sculptures , <P> Drottningholm 's theater was first the plaything of Lovisa 's son Gustaf III , founder of Sweden 's royal institutes ( including the Swedish Academy , which serves today as jury for Nobel Prizes in literature ) . Gustaf filled the place with musicians , staged four performances a week , wrote many of its plays and opera librettos himself , even starred in some of its productions . Shortly after his reign , the theater was abandoned , and for 120 years , says Director Gustaf Hillestrom , it remained " a sleeping beauty . " <P> Awakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its past , the theater was found to be still in good shape . Its collection of null 18th century sets , ranging from trompe I'oeil farmhouses to ornate court scenes , is the world 's largest . The wooden stage machinery , designed by the Italian master Donate Sopani , is so flexible that a four-man windlass team can make a complete scene change in ten seconds . In the 40-odd rooms where actors and singers once lived while the royal family was in residence at Drottningholm , the original hand-painted wallpaper survives-as does a wicked caricature of a needle-nosed French ballet master penciled on the wall of the prima. donna 's dressing room . A gold-painted harpsichord , discovered under the stage and now used by the orchestra , is considered one of the 18th century 's best .
