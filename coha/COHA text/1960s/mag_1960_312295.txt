I asked Rita Hayworth what she thought of Esther Williams , and Rita told me she thinks Esther is a good swimmer . Later on I asked Esther about Rita , and she said Rita is a good dancer . . . Curt Jurgens had a simple party at Cap Ferrat-twelve guests , the butler , the chauffeur , the cook , the secretary , one monkey , five parrots , and two dogs . . . Elsa Maxwell , looking like a weather-beaten hill , stood in the lobby of the Excelsior under a big straw hat which made it hard to tell what was front and what was back . <P> The raconteur of such **30;835;TOOLONG glimpses of the jet set at play is not named Louella , Hedda , Leonard or Dorothy . He is Germany 's Wiener-Schnitzel Winchell , Gossipist Hannes Obermaier , who writes a daily Page 2 column for Munich 's tabloid Abendzeitung called " Hunter Jots Down ' ' - the name Hunter coming from a brand of Dutch cigarettes that Obermaier likes . In the eight years that Obermaier has chronicled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulation has shot from 17,000 to 105,000 . His bosses give him much of the credit . Says Editor Rudolf Heizler : " I 've always let Hannes write what he pleases . His column is a hodgepodge of movie small talk , caf-society indiscretions and insinuations , nightclub gossip , and his occasional hangover spells of the moral shakes . But we long ago found that reading this hodgepodge becomes highly habit-forming . He 's our biggest circulation-getter . " <P> Fat Louse . Obermaier 's column has become required reading on casting couches from Berlin to Bel Air . As he travels to the world 's watering holes frequented by celebrities , he keeps forked tongue in cheek . In St. Anton , Austria , a ski resort , he wrote of the Shah of Iran 's exwife : " On the slopes , Soraya still behaved like a queen , was especially careful not to let any spill mar her majesty . She also refused to queue up at the snack bar . But she had to turn democratic afterward . There was no way of beating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' So great is his prestige that Film Producer Peter Bamberger says : " Obermaier has written himself into such power that he can seemingly make or break anyone in German moviedom . Last year in Venice , on a pure whim , he picked up Barbara Valentin-a blowzy blonde whom he referred to in private as a ' fat louse . ' Within one month , with the aid of all the columnists in the illustrateds who copy Hunter in everything he does , he made her into Germany 's No. 1 femme fatale . ' ' <P> Cat in the Jungle . Obermaier has not always been such a fat cat in the celebrity jungle . Born in a Bavarian village , he was a student in Munich when World War II broke out , was wounded on the Russian front , spent two years in a prisoner-of-war camp . In 1949 , after a variety of jobs , he won a competition for a cub reporter 's opening on Abendzeitung by doing a story about a night in a Munich police station . While the other contestants spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel room , wrote the story as he imagined it . Two years later , after a tour of the U.S. , he persuaded his editor to let him write a gossip column , culled his first effort from a stack of U.S. movie magazines he had brought back with him . <P> His columns have n't changed much since .
