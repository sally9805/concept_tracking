THE POLARIZING FORCE S H E came whipping in like a breath of fresh air , " I said later to my roommate . My freshman advisee , Megsie Shrader , had come in in a fencing jacket and breeches . She put her elbow straight . She had to keep it straight because of her leather elbow guards , but it impressed me . " Say , a fire , how divine , " said Megsie , and took a stance on the hearth , bending her foil by the pommel and button , 14Iegsie was the ideal women 's college physical type . She was a dark blonde who looked as if she looked like her father , with steel-blue eyes and a complexion of rather abraded freshness , and a massive but flat-chested build . " What I want to do is experiment a certain amount in all departments , working toward a very , very definite integration with my major field , " Megsie explained . " I sure wish I 'd had your sound approach , " I said . Megsie spoke benignly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatest boy , " she said . " In their house , my sister blends Period and Modern so the effect is sensational . I do n't know who but Tish could get away with a grandfather 's clock on a cantilever staircase ! " She added , " Mummy wrote me a going-away poem . The point of itwas , in the good old days youth was n't like this , but the point of it was , well , thank the Lord ! I mean , it stank by standards of anything Auden , but it was quite , quite cute of her . " Megsie also showed political circumspectness . She said she felt labor had gotten a certain amount decadent , and she could personally go along with co-existence , if you did n't take it at too much face value . Then , in leaving , she nodded at my Art Rental Library print , and said , - Listen , I 'm mad for your Filippino Lippi . " I reminded Megsie of her rosin . " Oh thanks , " she said . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gym , if you 've ever noticed . " " Does n't it stink , " I said . " She 's terribly well-rounded , " my roommate Muff agreed , although she had been trying to brood . My roommate was a Negro girl , and she tried to brood when anyone had said to her , " Does n't joy just seem to be born in your people ! " A co-op residence hall always brought out antisocial tendencies , and so far everything had looked threatening . Pussy Ridgeley , our House President , who was reading D. H. Lawrence for Contemporary Prose Fiction , asked me , " Do you feel sex adds anything ? " Enid Halpert , nailing a Help-Israel box on her door , said , through a 64 THE POLARIZING FORCE postnasal drip . " I came here for sweeps and trends ! Mrs. Mannheimer makes the Fall of Rome precious ! " Muff , my roommate , was an apocryphist , and to complicate this , she sometimes told the truth , because the faculty gave her ex officio information to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dike , " she told us . " They put her in the co-op to sublimate . " Healy House was a two-hundred-year-old barn , flimsily partitioned like a doll house ( if you slammed a door , a window opened in the next room ) . It smelled of fireplaces , the exterminator 's oil of peppermint , and wool socks drying on stretchers . All of us were worrying whether we could earn a living without suffering , avoid marrying people not the type we wanted to marry , have predominantly male children , a good sex life , and get to Europe . And distracting us from these basic worries were the problems of handling the faculty , our parents , and the people we were in love with at present . If we went to bed to escape , the Northern Express crossed the ceiling , and voices screeched through the walls , " Get him out of Tintern Abbey and he was an old lecher " ; " You 've still got to hand it to the Zemstvos " ; " My married sister says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Marx would absolutely die today ! " But just as I had counted on , it was Megsie who warned us , " Would you keep it down to a dull roar , kids , " in a fracas , or , " Louder and more bell-like , " when the person we were maligning approached . Her baritone carried us in our after-dinner singing of " Samuel Hall " and " A Bold , Bad Man Was This Desperado . " She also offered us wry , fatherly insights . She said to Pussy , " You 're so interdenominational it amounts to rabid bigotry . " She said to my roommate , " Muff , to have everybody and his brother making tip to you for everything all minority groups in history have suffered is quite a load you 're carrying , but if you do n't quit telling these whoppers , they 'll be saying to you , ' Is n't a vivid imagination just born in your people ! ' " " You 've had a terrific background in Abnormal , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Megsie . S 0 MEGSIE 'S announcement at our first House Meeting came as a blow to us . The twenty of us met around the fireplace , under a Brueghel 's " Winter . " All the girls appeared heavily bandaged , like second-degree burn victims , with scarfs bound around their pi ncurls , and wearing quilted robes and slipper-socks . Wehardly recognized each other , but we passed our knitting back and forth to cast off as if ministering to the disabled . " Kids , " said Megsie . " Something very , very sad , and very , very lamentable . " I admired her strong stress on the lam in lamentable . Holding a towel over one shoulder , her hair plastered in whirlpools around its bobby pins , Megsie looked like Julius Caesar . " Things are disappearing . Pussy 's Yardley . Mary-Vaughn lost her father 's dud hand grenade from World War I. " " I did n't say somebody took itt " said Mary-Vaughn . " It 's no good to anyone , it 's a dud hand grenade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have mistaken it for their Yardley , " said Pussy . Enid chortled something about greener in other people 's Yardleys . " I mean , the hand grenade had sentimental value to me ! " said Mary-Vaughn . " My Yardley ca n't begin to compare , " said Pussy . " It 's too much dichotomy , " said Enid . " Yardley and a hand grenade . " Megsie draped her towel in a toga and set her slipper-sock foot on the fender . " Well , it 's compulsive , " she explained . " But forget it , forget it , it was assy of rue ! I mean , I just was shattered at the bare idea , in such a really neat bunch of kids . " After the meeting , Mary-Vaughn started searching seriously for her hand grenade . We helped halfheartedly . " I 'm not too mad for the idea of a hand grenade floating around , " said Pussy . At about midnight , Mary-Vaughn got hysterical , and crawled into the kneehole of her desk . We told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had eight-fifteen classes . " We knew she was a dike , we did n't know she had weapons , " said Muff . The next day , Enid lost four dollars from A under her note-topic pad , and Pussy lost a carton of Camels . Before the end of the week , MaryVaughn 's Dumbo elephant and three-pound fruitcake , Enid 's sock-stretchers ( the socks were off them , and hung carefully on the radiator ) , and Pussy 's panda and Peruvian silver bracelet were gone , as well as more money and cigarettes , brownies and ballpoint pens . 0 N A night when Megsie was in the library doing her note topic on why Rome fell , we held a somber meeting . " Let 's face it , " said Enid . " She 's the best-adjusted girl on campus and she takes everything that 's not nailed down . " It was agreed that Muff and I had not been victims because , as usual , of Muff 's ethnic origins , and my scholarship . " She 's a Robin Hood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing worth taking , " said Muff . Pussy reported that she had taken up the problem with the Chaplain , and he had offered to come and lead a discussion on the Ethical Responsibilities of Personal Relationships in Academic Life , and to indicate to Megsie that he was always available to her , or to any student . " Why do chaplains always indicate ? " asked Enid . " Is it some gentile thing you ca n't come out and say anything ? " We voted on what after-dinner songs would pass for a chaplain , and agreed to cut " Bell-bottom Trousers . " Pussy also wanted to cut " The Girl Who Gets a Little Kiss , " but Muff said the Chaplain would take it as a compliment to be made to feel like one of the girls . After telling us he had never eaten such a meal and did n't know how we girls did it , the Chaplain joined heartily in singing " A Bold , Bad Man Was This Desperado . " Due to her honesty , Pussy made many Freudian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang , " A bold , had girl was this desperado . " The Chaplain led a discreet discussion on the theme of the Tenth Commandment , " Thou shalt not covet . " " Does not coveting our neighbor 's , or our roommate 's property , " asked the Chaplain , waving his demitasse , " imply a rejection of our roommate as an individual and ultimately , therefore , a rejection of God ? " He spoke of sportsmanship , and worked around to fencing , asking Megsie if she could help him out with his terminology . " I 'll be glad to whip upstairs for my foil if it will help you , " said Megsie . The Chaplain became very enthusiastic , and said maybe if we would excuse them just a moment , he could run up with Megsie and perhaps she 'd show him her equipment . " Ra pport ! " Pussy telegraphed exultantly to the rest of us , as Megsie led the Chaplain toward her room , speaking of target and timing . " As you lunge , I parry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and my room where we could hear across the bathroom . Megsie called , " On guard ! Keep your fingernails up , Mr. Hudson . " " My fingernails up , " said the Chaplain . " I 'll be darned . " The shadows of Megsie and the Chaplain pranced like courting storks on the pink floor of the john . " She would n't stab him , would she ? " I asked . " Mr. Hudson can take care of himself , " said Pussy . " They 've got a lot of eccentric grips , " said Megsie . " But I object to the interference with the play of the thumb and first finger , which is the absolute basis of orthodox foils . " " Well , I can certainly see how you 'd object to that , " said the Chaplain . " Tell me something , Megsie . ' What about the code , or the rules , which a good fencer adheres to ? " " International Rules , " said Megsie , carelessly . " And definitely you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the tremendous alertness required did n't tend to get her tremendously keyed up . " On the contrary , " said Megsie . " On guard is the normal position ! You relax as you lunge . You 've got eight parries . Sixteen , counting compound parries . If I 'm ever at all tense , I just count my compound parries . " The Chaplain , less confidently now , asked if people actually shouted " Touche ! " Well , " said Megsie , " of course you would want to acknowledge a good touch . " " I sure would , " said the Chaplain . After the Chaplain left , Megsie expressed appreciation to Pussy . " Listen . I think your Chaplain 's really terribly good , " she said . " He 's got quite a feeling for foils . And also quite , quite cute . " The next day , Pussy 's blown-glass penguin , Enid 's Help-Israel box , and Mary-Vaughn 's wire armature for Sculpture 110 all disappeared . We held another private meeting on what to do about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an escape , " said Enid . " The do n't coddle them attitude was how Hitler came to power , " said Pussy . " ' Poor Topsy , why do you steal ? ' " said Enid in a squeak . May Dikeman is a New Yorker , a Vassar graduate , a painter , and a mother . Her novel , " The Pike , " was published by Appleton in 1955 . " To rehabilitate her , we 've got to crack her , " said Mary-Vaughn . " It was the only thing wrong with her , " said Pussy . " A tragic flaw ! " said Enid . " She related well to co-op life , " I said . " She was crazy about the give and take , " said Enid . Pussy asked me if , as Megsie 's junior adviser , I would try to find out if anything were disturbing her , such as the Freshmen Hygiene lecture on the Facts . " I had the most priceless misconception of the navel . " said Pussy . W HEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find her in the dark . The radios in Healy House all played quietly as the stations signed off , and the Northern Express seemed to tear through the walls . I heard Enid scream , " I would n't marry a man who was a virgin , " and Mary-Vaughn yelled , " Whose foul thing in the bathtub ? " " Is anything disturbing you , Megsie ? " l asked . " Mrs. Dalloway , " said Megsic . " I do n't get her motivations . " As I turned on her desk lamp , Megsie winced and shut her eyes . Her face was very red . On her clothes horse , I saw Megsie 's pants ( embroidered " Tuesday " ) and bra , a size thirty-eight , A cup , hanging . The small size of the cup on such a large size bra seemed poignant to me , and I realized that I did not want to crack Megsie . However , I was prejudiced since Megsie had not robbed me , and I went on , " Megsie , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not really , " admitted Megsie , turning toward the wall . " Fichte frustrates me . He seems nebulous . " " What did you think of the Freshmen Hygiene lecture on the Facts ? " I went on , conscientiously . " It was a riot , " said Megsie . " Mrs. Dalloway reminds me of Mummy a certain amount , " she added . " Listen , I 'd adore a real bull session with you . I just am feeling quite , quite lousy . " When I went back to my room , I found the others waiting . " What 's the matter with you ? " asked Muff . " Megsie lost her insouciance tonight , " I said . " Do n't make my heart bleed , " said Enid . " I 've lost sixteen dollars . " " My roomie idealized her as a cool criminal type , " Muff apologized . " Well , now she 's pleading illness like somebody 's damned mother , " I said . In the morning I was awakened by Pussy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I would walk Megsie to the Infirmary . " She was sick , " I told Muff . Mary-Vaughn asked me if I wanted help in case Megsie made a break for it . " How is she going to make a break for it in the Shakespeare Garden ? " said Enid . " Crawl under the sundial ? " I found Megsic , her face a solid rash and her eyes shut , getting together her things ( and other people 's  --  I recognized Mary-Vaughn 's slide-rule case and Pussy 's toothbrush holder ) . Megsie had on tunic-style flannelette ski pajamas with a gay multiflavor Life Saver pattern . Over them , she put on her camel 's hair coat and a yellow wool scarf which I used to see on Pussy . " That 's a pretty yellow scarf , Megsie , " I said . " Thanks , " said Megsie . " Anything to protect my glands . " She strode along vigorously as we crossed the Shakespeare Garden , saving " Excuse me ! " when the cough got her . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the shapes of occasional furniture , hassocks , hat racks , coffins , and thrones , and a grinning statue , Falstaff or Caliban , so that it looked like a cemetery for small monsters . I did not feel I should try to crack Megsie when she had the measles . We spoke of the sundial . We agreed it did n't look as if it were working . Then Megsie said , " It was assy of me not to turn myself in last night . " " Turn yourself in ? " I asked . " To the Infirmary ! " said Megsie . " But I hated to leave my first really big job . " I asked Megsie what big job , and she explained , " Head cook ! I had the neatest menus all lined up . " As I left Megsie at the Infirmary . a FrankLloyd-Wright-style glass building reflecting the Shakespeare Garden , so that the stopped sundial seemed balanced on the Admitting Desk , with Caliban at the switchboard , she seemed to have something on her mind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cristabel ' paper saying what I think was really on Lady Geraldine 's stomach , do you think she 'd accept it if I said I was more intrigued to have it left up to my imagination ? " " Well , spin it out at least ten pages , ' ' I said . I warned Megsie that Dr. Mosely had once diagnosed measles as pregnancy , and promised to bring her assignments and cigarettes . When I got home , I said to Muff , " With her eyes shut , she did n't look so candid . " " Asleep , you look Iike a fiend , " said Muff . " In the Shakespeare Garden she said a lot of symbolic things , " I said . " It reminded me how the day we met her she said her sister got away with a grandfather 's clock on a cantilever stair-case , and every time she liked something of ours , she 'd say , ' I must get one of those ' . " A note Megsie sent me , in a clean-cut , open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laundry and A Passage to India ? Also can you find out if I 'm responsible for the Rise of the Bourgeoisie ? Thanx loads . P.S. You are the only one who has not mentioned that the stealing has stopped since I 've been in the Infirmary . " W I T II 0 U T Megsie , the stealing stopped , and Healy House fell apart . Enid found masked anti-Semitism in the biology department , and Pussy pressed for Interfaith Corporate Communions at 7:00 A.M. Muff , who was monotone , joined the choir because someone had said to her , " Is n't music just born in your people ! " We admitted we needed Megsie ; but Megsie had not needed us , she had preferred everything we owned . " She rejected us as individuals , as Mr. Hudson said , " said Pussy . " And we adored being rejected , " said Muff . " We envy such materialism , " said Enid . Her head was in her sinus vaporizer , so that her voice honked from the ceiling beams . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any price ; stuff we can always get ! Her attitude was , Get the stuff , to hell with people ! In a freshman , that 's security . " " Crack Megsie , and it will do something to us all , " I said . " No man is an island , " said Pussy . " Mr. Hudson always quotes that . " " For whom the belt cracks , " said Enid . When Megsie got back from the Infirmary , she got a call from the Office of the Dean , inquiring if she were now completely normal , in which case Dr. Mosely would drive her to a psychiatrist . We gathered on the bicycle rack on the frozen Healy House lawn to see Megsie off . " Honestly , " she said , " at this rate , how do they expect me to make up my Proto-Baroque ? " " She 's cracking , " whispered Mary-Vaughn . Dr. Mosely 's oxidized-purple Plymouth came up Healy Hill . Megsie stiffened and stuck both hands in her pockets . " Dr. Mosely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began . Dr. Mosely , who had been a prominent WAAC , stood at attention . " I 've had this quirk since I was a kid . " " Ahl " said Dr. Mosely . " Megsie , would you like me to get Mr. Hudsoni : " asked Pussy . " Thanks , Pussy , " said Megsie , " but I do n't see what Mr. Hudson could do . Dr. Mosely , I'vetried to fight it . They thought I 'd outgrow it . But one mile even in a new car . I toss my cookies . " Dr. Mosely turned and looked soberly at her Plymouth . " Do you upchuck , sister ? " she asked , in a low voice . She sent us into the house for towels . We all helped pack Megsie in towels while Dr. Mosely rolled all the windows clown . " I 'd hate to see a dog sick with Dr. Mosely , " I said , as they drove off . " Worse than this would happen to her if she were some kid from Forsythe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's being done on the Lower East Side , " said Pussy . " I bet ! " said Enid . Every time Megsie left , the fight was on in Healy House . Megsie got home the next night . I heard her call to Dr. Mosely , " I feel like a dog about your seat covers . " The next clay Pussy got a message from the Office of the Dean that it had been recommended that Megsie go out with boys , and could we get her a date ? " Find her the type guy who 'd give her the shirt off his back , " said Enid . Pussy said she had a friend at Union Theological Seminary who might bring a friend , but she wondered if he should be told that this girl , who was such a fine person in so many ways , had a problem . " And to check his valuables , " said Enid . But before we could get a concrete date for Megsie , we got the word that Prexy was coining to dinner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Muff explained . Prexy arrived on the appointed night in time for the hot apple juice in the living-room , but Megsie did not join us . Prexy had discovered an early Tudor laundry list which he read to us . " How priceless , Prexy , " we repeated , as we asked each other who had last seen Megsie . Megsie still had n't come when we went into the dining-room . I hung a napkin on the chair at Prexy 's right . fib THE POLARIZING FORCE " That type is craven at bottom , " said Enid , but there was sorrow in her voice . Mcgsie came in . Her dark-blonde hair was fastened with a gold barrette lost by Pussy in the first week of college . She had on a pale-yellow cardigan which Mary-Vaughn had worked on her entire sophomore year , and had only blocked in September . The collar of her crisp pique dickey was initialed E. L. H. As she took the napkin off the back of her chair , Pussy 's Peruvian silver bracelet showed on her wrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pussy admired the bracelet and barrette . " Thanks , " said Megsie , cheerfully . " 1 like them . " " She gave herself up in full uniform , " Enid said afterwards . " She wo n't be coming back after Christmas , " Muff assured us . B U T in January , Megsie came hack . She told me she had had a really neat vacation , but it was going to be good to knuckle down again and come to terms with the Pre-Raphaelites . Then , on an opalescent , zero morning , Mrs. Shrader arrived . " She 's a perfect plum dumpling ! " said Mary-Vaughn , who had seen her before she disappeared into Megsie 's room . Across the bathroom between our rooms , we heard Mrs. Shrader sobbing . " Have n't we given you everything-7 " she wailed . " You 've been terrific , Mummy ! " Megsie sobbed , ferociously . " Yet have n't we been sensible , have n't we avoided spoiling you ? " Mrs. Shrader wept . " Did n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wedding ? " " I never touched her old sinus vaporizer ! " Megsie suddenly roared , with a loud burst of tears . " And why clean bill of sobbed Mrs. " I want to " How can Mexico now ? if I can even Islands now . ' " I want to " Mexico , Vaughn . " She feels for the plight of the peons , " said Enid . " We are crushed that she cracked , so we 're being petty , " said Muff . " Who can sneer when their mother blubbers ? " I cried . " She ran the gantlet from the Chaplain to the psychiatrist ! She defeated the doctor and the Dean . She pulverized Prexy . We can never take that- away from Megsie ! " Mcgsie said good-by to us by herself while her mother superintended her son-in-law 's packing the car . She told us , " I want you all to know that I 've been to a few schools . And I 've gotten more out of this place , and out of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave us each her leather-elbow-guard handshake . We told Megsie that we would always think of her . The Shraders had only been gone a few minutes when a black sedan with a local license came slowly up Healy Hill . in the black sedan were four men in gray fedoras and pinkish-gray trench coats . " It 's the town police , " said Muff . " She cleaned out Kresge , Lerner 's , and Peck itz Peck . The college gave her medieval sanctuary , and got her off in time . " The black sedan slowed up in the miniature quad formed by the bicycle racks . The men in the fedoras and trench coats got out and stood there . " Drop a bag of water on them , " said Enid . " They could just be here to dig us a new cesspool , ' ' I said , but the others yelled , " With hats ? " We got through the dormer windows out onto a railed platform like a long play pen above the eaves . Pussy 's bath mat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it . I looked at the weathercock , apparently shot by the wrong end of an arrow , an American Primitive toy rooster for some American Primitive two-dimensional child , and knew it was wrong , like the sundial , driven by the unacademic elements . Beneath us the campus spread like a Christmas card , but the church spire was the Lucilla Kitchener Ball Hall of Chemistry , and the Community Church , Modern and all glass , looked like an aviary for eagles . At the tops of our lungs , we started to sing " Gaudearnus Igitur . " In hoarse and terrible college girls ' voices , raw with defiance and exultadon , we sang , " Post iucundarn itnientutem . Post rnolestam senertutem . " We had been in college too long to remember any Latin , but the words post rnolestara fired us ; we roared " Post moles-tam ! " at the transfixed four men below . Probably we did not even look like girls , but spawn of turret gargoyles and vultures  --  we had our camel 's hairs or senior gowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . None of us remembered any more words to the " Gaudearnus , " but with one accord , if all in different keys , we burst into final tribute to academic sanctuary , to the insouciance of Megsie Shrader , shrieking , " Oh , a bold ? bad girl was this desperado !
