Illiteracy is a social ill that grates on a nation 's conscience , raises painful visions of a stubborn ailment curable only by radical political surgery . Yet Mexico is showing the rest of the world that the condition can be successfully attacked with a combination of persistence , pesos and ingenuity . In 20 years , it has slashed its illiteracy nearly in half-from 52% to less than 28% . <P> In the rugged hills near Piaxtla , an isolated village in the state of Puebla , a modern auto recently pulled a bright orange trailer toward a group of waiting campesinos . They unhitched the trailer , hooked it up to a pair of brown oxen , and the animals plodded to the top of a hill overlooking the town . <P> Along the road below , all of Piaxtla 's residents cheered the trailer 's arrival-and with good reason . It was a mobile school , the first in the village 's history . <P> Nearly 200 such trailers , equipped with movie projectors , record players , school benches , and a cot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico 's rural areas . <P> 10,000 Classrooms . Launched in 1944 under President Manuel Avila Camacho , sharply stepped . up in 1959 by President Adolfo Lopez Mateos , and energetically continued by President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz for the past three years , Mexico 's campaign to wipe out illiteracy is gaining new momentum . Under Diaz Ordaz , Mexico has spent four times as much on education as it has on national defense ; up to 10,000 classrooms have been built each year during his administration , and 5,000 more are currently under construction . <P> What makes the achievement all the more remarkable is the difficulty of reaching much of Mexico 's unlettered population . Half of its 44 million people are land-tilling peasants . There are more than 50,000 communities with a population of less than 100-many of them accessible only by all but impassable dirt roads . But the isolation of the campesino is slowly breaking down . Fathers urge their sons to get some basic schooling so that they can land jobs in the nation 's expanding industries and urban areas . Thus when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it becomes a popular social center . The young children sit under an awning attached to the trailer for basic Spanish instruction in the morning , older youths return from farm chores to study in the afternoon , adults gather at night . <P> Villages large enough to support a permanent school can get one fast . From six large depots in Mexico City , they can order prefabricated steel frames , desks , blackboards , a basic 50-book library , toilet and shower , and quarters for a teacher . The village pays a third of the cost ( about $400 ) , supplies such wall material as concrete , adobe or brick , and provides the labor to assemble the structure , which can be put together in a few days . " Knowing that they have contributed , " explains Construction Engineer Enrique Estrada , " gives villagers a sense of pride and ownership . "
