txt An admitted political fixer and crime syndicate muscle man has outlined to THE TemLINE how the mob gained its first foothold in the multimillion dollar scavenger dumping business thru political payoffs . Secure in the belief that he was talking to two private investigators sympathetic to the mob , the hoodlum related hib bizarre story of monthly pay offs to politicians who cleared the way for hoodlum entry into the lucrative garbage dumping business . This Story a Surprise He will not know until he reads this story that his tale of political payoffs and corruption that reached into city government was told to a TRIBUNE reporter and Gear g e Bliss , chief investigator for the Better Government association . " We paid lthe politician S600 a month to go along with us on this thing , " the lower echelon hoodlum recalled as the black sedan cruised the alleys and dark streets of the south side for nearly an hour . He sat on the edge of the rear seat , chain smoking , and glancing out the window at every intersection . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he complained to when he got greedy and demanded $800 a month , " the hoodlum recalled . ' ' At that point we decided to go around hint and see the man downtown . " Wo n't Discuss Names When questioned about the identity of the " man downtown , " he insisted that " I do n't want to use any more names than I have to . " When a name was suggested by Bliss , the hoodlum insisted he did n't want to use any names . He said the Mafia chiefs in charge of making political payoffs accounted for the expenditures by placing minor hoodlums on one of their front operation payrolls at a large salary . When the hoodlum received his salary check he would cash it , keep his allotted share , and use the remainder as part of the payoff . The hoodlum recalled that when he began feuding with the politician over the amount of the payoff , the politician complained to the hoodlum 's superiors that the mob emissary was " holding out on him . " In Financial Trouble " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my people believed me , " said the hoodlum . " We still needed him the and the guy from Oak Lawn told me to stay out of the operation for awhile until the feud quieted down . He said he had since run into financial difficulties and hoped the private investigators " can do me some good . " Repeatedly referring to mob figures as " my people , " the hoodlum also recounted earlier setbacks in syndicate attempts to take over scavenger service thruout the city and its efforts to control the tacos industry in Chicago 's Spanish speaking communities . He said that because of these failures , the Cosa Nostra chiefs were particularly delighted at their success in the garbage dumping business . Recall Earlier Setbacks " I can well understand their delight in gaining a foothold in this industry , " Bliss said after the meeting . " If they can control the dumps , it gives them a strange hold on the hundreds of private legitimate scavengers who need a place to get rid of their refuse . " The earlier mafia setbacks recalled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 47 , a former policeman identified in 1967 as a mob associate by the Chicago Crime commission , to take over the one-million-dollar a year tortilla market in Chicago . Tortillas ? pancake shaped foodstuffs made of corn meal or white flour ? are an important part of the diet of many Chicagoans of Mexica n and Puerto Rican descent . They are consumed by more than 100,000 persons each day in Chicago . Report ** Bribe Offer Authorities linked a phony union , threats , and a dynamite bombing to the mob attempt five years ago to force 12 tortilla bakers to give up distribution of their product . In an other and unrelated aspect of the scavenger account , THE TRII3UNE disclosed Sunday that Edward R. Vrdolyak , loth ward Democratic committeeman , has accused of participating in an alleged $5,000 bribe offer to the committeeman to " quit screaming " about garbage dump operations in the ward . Vrdolyak also named Frank ( Frankie Dee DeStefano as the man who laid the stack of $100 bills on the table of a south side restaurant . DeStefano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operation of the Calumet . La n d Reclamation company , which operated an 85-acre landfill in the ward . also figured prominently in 1963 efforts by the mob to take over scavenger operations in Chicago along with syndic a te bookmaker George The Greek Bravos and Willie ( Potatoes Daddano , a mob roughneck who at one time operated the West Suburban Refuse Disposal service . The hoodlum move to take over the scavenger industry was thwarted by prompt action on the part of legitimate scavenger associations .
