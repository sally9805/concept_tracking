" The man with his skin peeled off , " as some astonished back-country Nigerians called White Man Billy Graham , pressed on with his African crusade last week . Everywhere , he drew huge crowds and impressive numbers of " decisions for Christ . " In Lagos , the Nigerian capital , Graham spoke to crowds as big as 100,000 , with nearly 2,000 coming forward to make their decisions in dead silence-an awesome phenomenon in chatty , emotional Nigeria . Even Moslems turned out to hear a preacher so different from what Africa has been accustomed to . " He 's an ordinary man like ourselves , " said one Moslem . " He does n't claim extraordinary powers or hold out an easy way to follow Jesus . " <P> But many of the Moslems-nearly half the 35 million population-were far from pleased with Graham . Before Billy reached Nigeria , their leaders had proposed a meeting with him . The request was turned down by Graham 's advance man on the ground that Billy 's schedule was too tight . The reply went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attending public meetings . . . " <P> To Nigerian Moslems , heady with a December election victory that kept their Moslem Prime Minister in power , this rebuff was evidence that the Graham crusade ( actually planned long before ) had been staged to help put the Christians in political control . Moslem pamphlets circulated during Graham meetings , presenting " Five Points to Remember : Jesus was not the Son of God , did not die on the Cross , was not resurrected , did not go to heaven , will not return . " <P> Billy did not reply , but for a time tempers boiled in statements and counterstatements between Nigerian Christian and Nigerian Moslem . This week things quieted down as Evangelist Graham took some time off for rest and a trip to visit Dr. Albert Schweitzer in Lambarn . <P> An unusual new volunteer offered her services to Graham 's crusade last week . The volunteer : comely Divorcee Eleanor Searle Whitney , ex-wife of Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney , onetime choir soloist in Dover , Ohio , who became one of Billy 's most faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she rounded up a Bible class of her Long Island friends for Evangelist Graham to address in private sessions . After a quick tiger-shoot in Nepal and a swing through Iran , Eleanor Whitney let it be known last week that she intends to join Graham , possibly to help by her musical know-how during the remaining weeks of the trip . <P> In Nigeria , a puzzled Billy said he knew nothing about Mrs. Whitney 's joining his team , but added gallantly : " There is nothing to prevent her following the crusade as a private individual .
