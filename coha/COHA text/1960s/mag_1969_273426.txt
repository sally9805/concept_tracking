A casual glance at investment statistics might suggest that 1968 was a vintage year for mutual funds . Most of them outperformed the market and , overall , the assets of 300 U.S. funds grew a healthy 22% , from $45 billion to $55 billion . Of 307 funds surveyed by Manhattan 's Arthur Lipper Corp. , 285 did better than the Dow-Jones average of 30 blue-chip industrial stocks , whose average 4.3% growth barely kept abreast of inflation . Altogether , 238 funds topped the 9.4% gain of the New York Stock Exchange 's index of all its 1,249 common stocks . <P> Unfortunately , that record is more than a little misleading . The 69 funds that failed to outperform the Big Board 's index account for some $21 billion-or more than 38%-of all the money in funds . Investors Mutual Fund , the industry 's biggest ( assets : $3 billion ) , grew a disappointing 8.45% . A sister fund , Investors Stock ( $2.3 billion ) , gained 8.3% , while Wellington Fund ( $1.8 billion ) rose only 8% . Fidelity Trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1967 , achieved no more than a 1.76% rise last year . <P> Deep Tsai . Eight funds actually declined in value . Among them was Gerald Tsai 's $454 million Manhattan Fund . It rose 39% in 1967 but slumped nearly 7% in 1968-to wind up at the very bottom of the list . Though Tsai 's 1967 performance was certainly above average , many investors expected much greater growth ; in 1968 , his fund was hit with higher than normal redemptions . <P> To fund managers , 1968 proved the general rule that the bigger they are , the more difficult they find it to grow through investment . " It 's been a tough year , " says Grady Green , vice president of the $351 million Channing Growth Fund . Channing ranked high in 1967 , when it grew 47% ; last year , with a growth of 2.6% , it was 296th . Like the Manhattan Fund and many other big funds , Channing was heavily invested in the more seasoned glamour stocks-Ling-Temco-Vought , Fairchild Camera , Polaroid-that declined during the stock slump before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow to recover . Big funds can not move out of such stocks quickly without upsetting the market ; but smaller funds can-and they did . In a highly selective market , says Channing 's Green , " There is no doubt that a small fund has an advantage . After you get to a certain size , bigness itself interferes with your flexibility in moving in and out of stocks . " <P> Of last year 's ten fastest-growing funds , only four exceeded $10 million in assets . Fastest rising was the Neuwirth Fund , which has assets of $94 million and achieved 90% growth . In 1967 -a year in which it was hard to do badly-Neuwirth grew 300% . But 1968 , as 36-year-old Manager Henry Neuwirth says , " was more on the selective side . " Neuwirth selected a number of long-depressed insurance stocks ( CNA Financial , Safeco ) early in the year , then rode them up as insurance companies became sought-after merger candidates .                   @ @
