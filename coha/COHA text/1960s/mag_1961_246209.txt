Just before dawn , a weapons carrier bounced over scrub-spotted sand dunes to a secret site near the Mediterranean . Out stepped Israel 's Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion and Foreign Minister Golda Meir . Near the water 's edge , a slim rocket loomed 40 ft. up into the night sky . <P> " What are the chances it will succeed ? " asked Ben-Gurion . " Fifty-fifty , " was the reply . At 4:41 a.m. came the command " Esh ! " ( Fire ! ) , and the rocket lifted off . <P> " It 's going up ! " shouted the Prime Minister . The solid-fueled , multiple-stage rocket ( the number of stages was a military secret ) tilted slightly and soared up 50 miles . There it emitted a cloud of sodium vapor-a standard means of enabling observers to track ionospheric wind currents . <P> Israel 's first rocket was labeled the second-Shavit Shtayim , or Comet II . Deputy Defense Minister Shimon Peres explained that this prevented the rocket from becoming known as Shavit Aleph . First letter of the Hebrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party . " We would be accused of making propaganda for the Mapai , " explained Peres . Israel boasted that the rocket was " planned , constructed and fired by Israeli scientists and technicians , " claimed that most of the raw materials were local . " <P> Other nations-notably the U.S. , Russia , France , Britain , Italy , Japan , Canada and Australia-have fired weather rockets . But Shavit was the first fired by any Middle Eastern country , and a tremor of alarm ran through Israel 's Arab neighbors ( the Arabs suffered a similar tremor seven months ago when Israel admitted it was constructing a 24,000-kw. nuclear reactor ) . Presumably , any nation that can send a rocket winging 50 miles up for wind data can readjust its flight for military purposes . Jordan 's Prime Minister Bahjat Talhouni said his government was " extremely concerned . " <P> Israel itself was of two minds about Shavit . Ben-Gurion insisted that the rocket was for science . But Peres said that Israel had given rockets a high priority because of " grave defense problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would change their belligerent policies , we would change our priorities .
