txt President Johnson 's state of the Union remarks on Vietnam have been received with satisfaction in Saigon . In an interview with this correspondent Thursday , South Vietnam 's Foreign Minister , Dr. Tran Van Do , said : " President Johnson has reaffirmed the American commitment here . The Americans are going to stand by us . They will not let us down . " It is no secret that some circles in the South Vietnamese Government have been uneasy and disturbed about the American peace offensive and the pause in air strikes against North Vietnam . They want peace , but on honorable terms which guarantee South Vietnam 's security . And they see no indication that Hanoi is yet prepared to grant that . The presidential message made it clear the United States still hopes for peace . The United States will , as the President declared , " meet at any conference table , discuss any proposals , consider the views of any group . " But among both Americans and South Vietnamese in Saigon there now is little if any belief that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on that portion of the President 's message which pledged : " The days may become months , and the months may become years , but we will stay as long as aggression commands us to battle . " Withdrawal demanded Dr. Tran Van Do , in his interview , declared : " There is only one way left . We have to fight , and fight hard . Our position remains the same . The Communists are the aggressors . If they really want to negotiate , if they want this war to end , they must stop their aggression and withdraw their North Vietnamese regular troops , " Said the South Vietnamese Foreign Minister : " These are very reasonable conditions . The Allies could not have negotiated with the Germans in World War II while German troops remained on French soil . " Had the American peace offensive taken place on this scale early last year , said Dr. Tran Van Do , there would have been a crisis of morale among South Vietnamese . " But now , " he said , " they have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States can not pull out without the world losing faith and confidence in it . President Johnson 's state of the Union message is yet another reassurance and reaffirmation of the United States commitment here . "
