In all its long and stodgy history , the British Museum had rarely put on such a smashing show . There was something for every taste-Bronze Age jewelry , Persian miniatures , African masks , Dresden porcelain , drawings by the top Renaissance masters . But it was not the art that brought the public streaming in . The objects were the museum 's most painful mistakes : fakes that had cost the museum dear in pounds and embarrassment . <P> A year ago , appalled by the number of fraudulent Turner water colors that were cropping up in London , the museum 's keeper of prints and drawings , Edward Croft-Murray , decided to warn the public by putting on a special show of fake Turners along with some originals . The idea quickly spread to other departments , and even to collectors and connoisseurs on the outside . Art Historian Sir Kenneth Clark contributed a 17th century unicorn horn ; Sir Alister Hardy lent his mummified mermaid . From the museum 's storerooms came the famed fabricated Piltdown man ( TIME , Nov. 30 , 1953 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the departments of antiquities , and the bust of Julius Caesar that graced the pages of Latin textbooks everywhere until in 1936 it was found to be a 19th century job . <P> Some of the fakers have taken their own places in art history . One Edward Simpson , a 19th century master forger of Stone Age implements , came to be admired among archaeologists as the fabulous " Flint Jack . " Two illiterate London mudrakers named Billy and Charley produced and buried thousands of " ancient " metal objects , and such objects are known as " Billys and Charleys " to this day . An ingenious forger named Peter Thompson , actually a carpenter and builder living near Regent 's Park in the 1840s , not only forged 17th century " master drawings , " but also invented the master . He named the man Captain John Eyre , and after picking a onetime lord mayor of London , Simon Eyre , as a likely ancestor , wrote a convincing biography and genealogy of him . Eyre , according to Thompson , was born in Blakewell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wounds suffered at the battle of Marston Moor . He supposedly spoke French and Spanish fluently , was " proficient in music , " turned out at least 300 drawings that were found in his lodgings after his death . <P> Though Eyre 's " drawings " deceived London for quite a spell , the museum itself was in this case above reproach . Twice it turned down the opportunity to buy Eyre 's Southwark Fair . But in the end Forger Thompson won out anyway . The museum became so intrigued by his work that it bought up the whole Eyre collection as an admirable example of an artful forger 's art .
