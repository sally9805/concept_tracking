txt Coronado , Cal. , Jan. 24 ? Grim but seemingly confident , Comdr . Lloyd M.

Apparently the commander had recovered from the mental and physical crisis which left him almost unable to speak and tottering in yesterday 's session . Questioning by the court members in today 's secret session , from which all but members of the court and those with high security clearances were barred , was described afterward as " relaxed , incisive , but not hostile " to the principal figure . Reports on Reds ' Haul From his seat facing the board members , Bucher spoke into a microphone and provided the court , it was stated later , with a detailed account of exactly what material the North Koreans obtained when they boarded the Pueblo and seized it in January , 1967 .
