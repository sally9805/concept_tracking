 | Wild Elephant Roundup F ROM MY SMALL PLATFORM in a mango tree I could look far down the Kabbani River of India 's Mysore State . I had been waiting for hours . Now I heard the first distant cries of the beaters . The din of bamboo clappers , the shouts and howls of men , the blasts of shotguns , and the trumpeting of wild elephants shattered the air . Then I saw the great herd moving through the teak in the jungle across the river . Soon the close-packed animals reached the river bend , where a band of kumkies ? as tame elephants are called ? turned them down a flat sandy beach and out into the river . They drove directly toward my perch as I aimed my camera at the confused scene ? a tumbling mass of gray shapes , with scores of trunks waving in the air and an occasional flash of white tusks . Behind the herd , steady and firm , came the lines of kumkies with tinylooking men waving and shouting from their backs . Following them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards , boys and men of all ages in all manner of clothes from ragged loincloths to shirts and ties , every one banging away furiously with bamboo clappers , howling , whistling , and cheering . This was the climactic moment of Mysore 's famous wild elephant drive . Elephants Work as Lumberjacks I had come six weeks before to the State Forest at Kakanakote , near the southern border of Mysore ( map , right ) , to watch the Forest Department catch wild elephants by the khedda method . In a dramatic roundup , lines of beaters and kumkies drive an entire herd of wild elephants through the forest to a stockade . From this they are later taken to be tamed and trained ? primarily to help in harvesting teak , rosewood , and other valuable timber that can fetch up to $7,000 a tree. * When I arrived at Kakanakote , the area seethed with activity . Under the direction of Conservator C. Jayaram Reddy , superintendent of kheddas , more than 8,000 teak logs and 20,000 stems of bamboo had been cut to build an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows of diggers , wielding enormous long-handled shovels , scooped out four-foot-deep holes in the hard dark earth , and into these the kumkies tipped 374 @# the heavy teak logs , each 18 to 20 feet long . Following the kumkies , teams of villagers tamped down the earth at the bases of the heavy uprights , then lashed horizontal wooden bars between them . At the edge of the stockade others dug V-shaped ditches , eight feet deep and nine feet wide at the top ? a precaution against newly captured elephants making a concerted attempt on the fence Since elephants are unable to achieve even the smallest hop or spring and are extremely fearful of steep places , where their heavy bodies might be injured in a fall , the ditches make effective barriers .

Over hundreds of miles of forest , all the bamboo simultaneously had come to the end of its 60-year cycle of life , flowered , and died . It was slowly growing again , but in the meantime the feathery fronds of the giant stems had vanished , and with them much of the food and cover elephants require . Inside the stockade there would be neither natural fodder nor shade for the captured animals . Elaborate preparations therefore had to be made to truck in fodder ? river grass , banyan-tree twigs , and sugar cane . Meanwhile Divisional Forest Officer H. P. Viswanathan was tackling other problems : " During the hottest part of the day , " he told me , " elephants suffer from direct sunshine . Here in the stockade I 'm setting up artificial shade and a shower system to keep them cool and damp . " His crew had embedded a pipe in a furrow cut into the trunk of a tree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the branches . Two pumps at the river would raise the water to supply this strange shower bath . The health as well as the comfort of the elephants needed attention . In charge was diminutive Dr. C. V. R. Rao , veterinary officer to the Mysore Forest Department . He would eventually lose sleep over the wild herd , but right now his concern was for the 35 kumkies . " For all their great size , " Dr. Rao explained , 375  | " my elephants are as sensitive and delicate as human patients . They suffer from indigestion and respiratory complaints , and even from the common cold . " With enthusiasm and affection , Dr. Rao explained how the kumkies , their forefeet shackled to prevent them from wandering too far , were released into the forest every evening after they had been bathed and fed . " This keeps them in good health they are happy roaming about freely , they can forage for themselves , and the females can mate with wild tuskers . " Occasionally a mishap occurs . Once a khotal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the elephant 's keeper ? by washing , feeding , and bathing the animals , went in search of a wandering kumkie cow early one morning . Unknown to him , an affair had been in progress between his kumkie and a wild tusker . The love-struck gentleman was concealed in a bamboo thicket when the boy ar-@#  | rived . He charged and killed the lad instantly . Like the mahouts , the yajamans ? the hunter-trackers ? are vital to the success of a khedda . Many are old men with a lifetime of jungle experience behind them . They appeared from time to time at Kakanakote to report to the forest officers on the movements of wild herds . A few wore long black frock coats and sported silver medals attesting to their part in kheddas as long ago as 1923 . On December 30 , 1967 , the yajamans re- ported that a large herd had been discovered near the Kabbani River . The drive opened at Mastigudi , nearly two miles downstream from Kakanakote . There , early in the morning , the forest officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ancient peepul tree before the small stone image of Mastiamma , the goddess of the forest . Then the long procession marched solemnly and silently off . In time they would surround the wild @#  | elephants and drive them toward the stockade . For the present , however , the herd was confined only by lines of tribal watchmen with stacks of firewood that they kept ablaze all night and smoking by day ( page 375 ) . Ordinarily the elephants would not pass this barrier , which stretched for miles . But the greatest care had to be taken not to panic the herd , for then it might well stampede through the thin defense . During the next few days the forest officer . planning each move on detailed maps , gradually reduced the encirclement . " Not only do we have to study every movement the elephants make and take countermeasures , " Mr. Reddy told me , " but we must also control 1,500 watchmen . I must make sure they get food , that they do n't drop off to sleep , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or desertions , and that they @#  | @# receive their daily pay of 40 cents each . " Finally the giant trap was sprung . The wild Nerd was sent thundering through the forest toward captivity . From my perch in the mango tree high above the stockade , I had a spectacular view as the immense animals charged straight toward me . At the khedda entrance , two teak logs 27 feet high supported a hinged wooden drop gate held open by a rope . A short fenced corridor had been built from the gate into the water , and from the end of this a steel cable had been stretched across the river with four bamboo rafts attached to it at intervals . Fires had been lighted on the rafts , and behind them , up to his middle in water , stood a great kumkie tusker named Ranga ? one of the biggest elephants in India . Ranga , who carries the Maharaja of Mysore at festivals , was too old for the long , hot drive through the 379  | forest . His assignment was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the rafts . In utter panic now , the animals tried to climb the far bank of the river , only to find the way blocked by a stout barrier . Behind this , in a grandstand , thronged 1,700 spectators . Urged by the beaters and kumkies , the beasts wheeled back into the river , where a few of them broke away and tried to escape again along the far bank . Elephants can not gallop , but they can do up to 18 miles an hour at a kind of trot ? astonishingly rapid for such big creatures . As the breakaway came , a detachment of kumkies trotted after the fugitives at top speed and drove them back to the main herd , which was now slowly making its way under the trees on the riverbank toward the gate . Mother Makes a Heroic Rescue The whole great milling crowd of men and beasts surged below me at the khedda entrance . There , for a quarter of an hour , they stuck . The old cow who led the herd sensed the trap and refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrieked to Allah for assistance ; the kumkies thrust their tusks hard and often into the broad backsides before them . Then , for me , came an agonizing demonstration of the elephant 's wonderful bravery and tenderness . I saw a tiny calf , a few days old , running among the legs of the kumkies , without the slightest idea of where it was or what was happening to it . The mother , a wrinkled , brave old lady , did not hesitate . Turning aside from the wild herd , she charged heroically at her tormentors ? kumkies , men , guns , beaters , and all . Shouldering her way among them until she reached her baby , she turned him in the right direction and , nudging him along with her trunk , pushed him ahead of her to rejoin the herd . Finally , exhausted and beaten , the elephants in twos and threes slipped through the gate and into the khedda . A cheer went up from the crowd as a concealed mahout slashed the rope that held up the gate and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kumkie 's side in the roping corral . Seconds before , he dodged between the pile-driver legs of the wild cow he had helped to tie . Mahouts on kumkies slipped head ropes on the captive . Safe behind a wall of teak and bamboo , camera fans focus on the action , frantic and frighteningly near . Some 1,700 spectators paid as much as $66 each for seats . KODACNPOME BY JAMES P. BLAIR ? N.G.S. 380 @#  | down with a great crash behind the last of the herd . Several days passed before the animals could be accurately counted , for the calves and young elephants huddled nervously together . But finally we knew the size of the herd : 86 ? one of the biggest ever caught . Every evening the mahouts strewed sugar cane about the floor of the adjacent roping stockade , which consisted of three concentric circles of heavy log fencing ( preceding pages This enclosure was connected to the khedda by a short passage , and the gate at its entrance was left open .

Next morning there were no elephants waiting to be roped , so the kumkies with their riders entered the khedda to cut out a few and drive them into the roping stockade ( pages 372-3 ) . The wild herd was drinking calmly at the khedda pond when the line of kumkies quietly approached . Like a row of kettle spouts , a score of upturned trunks lifted toward them , trying to catch the scent . Then the cow elephant who led the herd stiffened her tail and swung one forefoot angrily at the ground ? the certain preliminary to a charge . The old lady went at them in a cloud of dust , with a screaming trumpet of rage . There are few things in the animal kingdom more awe-inspiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great kumkie tuskers momentarily recoiled before 383  |p384.  her onslaught , but she could do little against their solid ranks . The herd now left the water hole , milling about as the kumkies approached . Then five wild elephants broke away and headed toward the roping stockade . The kumkies followed hot on their heels , but it was many minutes before even the biggest tuskers , like Ranga , could push them in far enough for the gate to be dropped and the roping to begin . With the kumkies leaning heavily on the wild elephants to jam them against the sides of the stockade , mahouts slipped in and out among the huge , thrashing legs , risking death from desperate kicks but always somehow managing to avoid them ( preceding pages ) . After many attempts the mahouts on the ground slipped nooses high up over the wild elephants ' back legs , while mahouts atop the kumkies got nooses around the necks . Where else , I wondered , do men take as many risks for $20 a month ? In 10 days all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peel khana , or training camp , at Mastigudi . To control the captives on the mile-long trip , the mahouts roped the wild elephants to the kumkies ; at the training ground they transferred the ropes from kumkies to trees . It was an impressive sight to see in the small area of the peel khana no fewer than 121 elephants . including the kumkies . Once a day the elephants were led from the camp down to the river and allowed to drink and bathe , a time-consuming operation involving many men and , in the case of big elephants , three kumkies each . Younger elephants could be trusted to a single kumkie. and it was on one of these , with only littlt Siddhappa , at 15 the youngest mahout pre -- ent , that I went down to the river . Temperamentally the wild elephants behaved according to their ages , much as humans would . The little chaps were by far the most active , tearing away at their ropes , lashing out furiously at anyone nearby , and at times rolling over and over on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stolidly , watching with tiny angry eyefor any chance of escape , or an opportunity for a swipe at their captors . Training Goes On Day and Night A permanent guardian was assigned to each captive elephant ? mahouts to the big ones , their teen-age sons to the Smaller ones These guardians stayed beside their charges day and night , eating and sleeping there , talking to them constantly , feeding and cleaning them , dressing wounds caused by chafing ropes , answering any aggressive use of the trunk with a poke from the pointed elephant goad ( called the ankus ) , and rewarding good behavior with chunks of sugar cane . The first requisite of the training program was to win the elephants ' respect . The mahouts knew perfectly well that cruelty was out of the question , for an elephant can split a man 's skull with a flick of its trunk , and a badly treated elephant will look for the first opportunity to do so . A change in almost all the animals was soon apparent . They ambled to the river with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | dangerous to approach . In the river , the joy of the little elephants was indescribable when they found they could swim . They half-somersaulted on their ropes , heads down and bottoms up , in sheer excited delight , suggesting small boys let loose on a hot summer day . Bargains Struck With Astrologers ' Help Five weeks after capture , 38 of the elephants were auctioned off at Mastigudi . They brought the State Treasury a total of $22,093 . Females normally bring the highest prices , but this time the most expensive animal was a young tusker . He sold for $1,265 . Most of the buyers were either timber contractors or temple trustees . Many were accompanied by astrologers , who studied the animals for auspicious signs and markings believed to reveal temperament , working ability , health , and probable life span . A trustee from the famous Hindu temple at Nagercoil , at the southernmost tip of the Indian peninsula , was shopping for young tuskers to serve as sacred elephants on ceremonial occasions . But the great majority of the elephants bought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Divisional Forest Officer Basave Gowda Balaiah assured me that the lumberjack kumkies of Mysore and Kerala would never be replaced by machines . " No matter how carefully you handle a tractor , " he said , " it is bound to damage young trees ? and what a racket it makes besides ! But even a big tusker can move so delicately ? and quietly ? through dense forest that hardly a blade of grass is injured , let alone trees . No , we will always want our kumkies here . " The elephant also appears content to forestall the technological revolution . This adaptable animal is one of the few wild creatures that can be tamed and trained when adult . One of the reasons is that the elephant is among the most intelligent of all animals . Still another is that , like the dog , the elephant develops a puzzling affection and indulgence for those noisy , destructive , simian little animals around them called men . The animals I came to know so well at Kakanakote adjusted happily to human society ? including mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and notebooks in my pockets , I usually carried goodies for the kumkies ? bits of sugar cane , jaggery ( brown cane sugar ) , and tiny local bananas . The females were especially adept at looting my pockets of these delicacies . Once , nine of them pinned me to the fence at the shrine of Mastiamma . Quietly but firmly , with the ultimate in good manners , these ladies robbed me of everything edible I possessed . When I tried to escape , there was always a trunk , a hefty shoulder , or a massive foreleg casually blocking the way . No one pushed or jostled or grabbed . It was all as genteel as a cookie-andsherry party at a Victorian parsonage . The grinning mahouts tried to dissuade the animals with one or two half-hearted bangs on their heads with the ankus , but these only produced foolish gurgles from somewhere up at the tops of their trunks . They knew exactly how far they could go . With a sucker like me , that was pretty far .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
