WHEN Italian Portraitist Pietro Annigoni met Germany 's new Chancellor , Dr. Erhard said : " I have seen some of your paintings of the British royal family . And I remember the one you did of President Kennedy . Tell me , how many sittings did they give you ? " <P> " Well , I had 33 with the Queen Mother and just over 20 with Princess Margaret . I was with President Kennedy for nine hours . " <P> " Ach mein Gott , " said Erhard in mock terror . " I hope with me you will work faster . What will you paint of me ? " <P> " The head and shoulders . " <P> " Good , " laughed Erhard . " The rest of me is not so paintable . " <P> Annigoni had four one-hour sittings with Erhard for this week 's cover , painting for ten minutes at a stretch , then letting Erhard rest for five . Erhard asked if he might read and smoke during the sittings , and was told please , no . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> <P> IN the beginning , TIME set out to bring the busy reader a condensation of the week 's news . We still keep the busy reader in mind , but long ago learned that condensing was not enough if we were to bring him the answers to the questions that headlines and news bulletins left untouched . In this week 's issue are several examples of the way our editors dig deeper into the news to illuminate and enrich what otherwise would be merely topical items : <P> Religion tells of a German play that is stirring up controversy in four European cities , arguing that the late Pope Pius XII refused to condemn openly the Nazi murder of Jews . It seemed to us not enough merely to note the accusation and the acrimony , and we set out to look into how and why the Pope behaved as he did . <P> The Nation tells the story of a Congressman from Chicago , a machine politician who watched a TV program that he did n't like , and returned to the House to upset the Kennedy Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill . And TIME 'S new Law section records the variety of ancient legal devices that Southern cities are using to thwart civil rights militants . <P> The Hemisphere picks up the trail of the latest head of state to visit Washington , Bolivia 's President Victor Paz Estenssoro , but bases the main part of the story on a look at the poverty-stricken country that has persuaded the U.S. to allocate it more aid per capita than any other Latin American nation .
