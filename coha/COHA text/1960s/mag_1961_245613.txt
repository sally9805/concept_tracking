Pressagentry is supersensitive in the U.S.S.R. And so , not until last week did Russia let the world know about a dramatic August 1960 crisis that almost brought disaster to Vostok , the Soviet base near the South Magnetic Pole . <P> August is the coldest month at Vostok , and during three dark days the temperature fell to the alltime record low of - 88.5 C. ( - 126 F. ) . Inside the low , insulated buildings the twelve-man crew was comfortable enough , warmed by the waste heat from the main diesel generator . " But at this temperature , " explained Base Chief Vasily Sidorov , " diesel fuel becomes a sticky mass , antifreeze crystallizes and metals get brittle . So it was not perhaps surprising that our main diesel cracked its bedplate . " <P> With the main diesel out , a small emergency generator provided a little heat and electricity . But soon the terrible cold outside struck into the dim-lit quarters . Burning diesel oil in improvised stoves was out of the question . Used in this inefficient way , the supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably the only-chance for Vostok was to get the main diesel running again so its generous heat could beat back the cold . <P> The mechanics took the diesel off its base and tried to weld the crack . Part way through the job , the welding torch ran out of oxygen . Now Vostok was really in peril . Its only hope was a cylinder of oxygen dropped from an airplane the previous autumn . It had broken loose from its parachute and plunged into deep snow . Efforts to find it were abandoned , but the area where it fell-more than a mile from the station-had been carefully marked . <P> Venturing cautiously into the lung-freezing cold , the crew lit torches and stretched a guide rope through the darkness to the place where the cylinder had fallen . By the light of a bonfire they pitched a tent over the marked spot . Inside the tent they set up a stove and fed it with empty provision boxes and spare clothes soaked in used lubricants . Foot by foot a shaft sank down through the snow . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep , but still no sign of the oxygen cylinder . <P> " Enthusiasm was lagging , " said Sidorov , " when Igor Ivanov and Gleb Nikolayev signaled to be lifted up the shaft . Everybody looked down and saw their smiling faces . Nikolayev was holding a rope , the end of which we knew was attached to the cylinder . " After eight more feet of digging , the cylinder itself appeared . It was hurried back to the fast-cooling station and used to weld the base plate . Soon the main diesel was chugging again . Vostok was saved .
