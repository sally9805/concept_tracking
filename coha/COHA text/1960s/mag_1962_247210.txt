( See Cover ) <P> It was an occasion for Republican hurrahs . In 17 cities across the U.S. , party loyalists were gathered at fund-raising dinners to hear pep talks , over closed-circuit TV , about this fall 's congressional elections . Dwight Eisenhower , speaking from Los Angeles , was interrupted repeatedly by loud applause . Senator Barry Goldwater drew a spirited response . So did National Committee Chairman William Miller . Then the voice and figure of New York 's Governor Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller confronted the diners . And at every single meeting , from Boston to Tulsa . Rocky was ignominiously booed . <P> That was a mere four months ago . Today , in a turnabout remarkable even by the volatile standards of U.S. politics , Rocky gets cheers from Republican regulars around the land . Almost everyone agrees that he is the man to beat for the Republican Party 's presidential nomination in 1964 . This week the Gallup poll ( which takes Richard Nixon at his word that he will not be a candidate ) reported that among rank-and-file Republicans Rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to 23% for Barry Goldwater , a surprising 14% for Milton Eisenhower , and a mere 8% for Michigan 's George Romney . <P> What has happened to bring about this change ? <P> To Republican professionals , Rockefeller long seemed a maverick . They looked on him as a liberal , whose views often sounded more Democratic than Republican . They saw him as a troublemaker when he publicly criticized his party 's leaders and program during his abortive attempt to win the 1960 G.O.P. nomination . Then there was the matter of his divorce from his wife of 32 years-and the insistent rumors that he intended to marry a younger woman . <P> Into the Vacuum . But so far , Rockefeller seems to have weathered his divorce well . And recently , quite independently of his own efforts , he has been thrust into the vacuum in national leadership that plagues either U.S. political party when it does not hold the White House . Nixon , the G.O.P. 's " titular leader , " has in recent weeks run into trouble in California and , despite last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survival in his fight against Governor Pat Brown . Goldwater , who seemed for a while to be a hopeful G.O.P. prospect , has been hobbled by the fact that he is beginning to sound to many like a broken record , and by the party pros ' conviction that he is simply too conservative to win a national election . Such dark-horse possibilities as Romney and Pennsylvania 's William Scranton have yet to prove themselves in their home states . <P> That pretty much leaves Rocky . But if happenstance has helped , so has hard work . As Governor of the nation 's most powerful state , he has administered its wide-ranging affairs ably and conscientiously , placed himself among the limited ranks of really effective U.S. Governors .
