Although it is advertised as a film about student unrest in Paris and Prague , A Matter of Days is hardly the thing to see for ideological inspiration . It is a quiet , sentimental little love story that happens to be set against a university background , a sort of La Chinoise for squares . When a French graduate student ( Thalie Fruges ) goes to bed with her professor boyfriend ( Vit Olmer ) for the first time , Director Yves Ciampi actually cuts to an exterior long shot of the light being turned out in the garret -a graceful , old-fashioned touch that is fairly typical of the entire film . Activists will be angry that Ciampi is obviously more interested in passion than politics , since he uses last spring 's political riots merely as a plot device to separate the lovers . <P> Sentimentalists will accept Days without question or quibble . Actor Olmer bears an uncanny resemblance to Mike Nichols and performs with bemused authority , but the film really belongs to Thalie Fruges , whose effortless , effervescent sexuality lends Days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
