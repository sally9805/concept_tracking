The Money Trap would be a pretty good suspense melodrama if it could only learn when to keep its trap shut . Until the dialogue gets in his way , Hero Glenn Ford is quite persuasive as a gruff $9,200-a-year detective , blessed with " a beautiful home , the wife I want , a swimming pool , three cars and two servants . " The fringe benefits have been provided by his rich missus , miscast Elke Sommer , who was obviously born to play a bauble-headed blonde who marries a man to enjoy his money instead of bringing her own . Elke makes a weak role weaker by delivering all of her lines as though she had learned them phonetically , but she at last articulates one crucial point : her cash has run out . <P> The movie springs fitfully to life when Ford and his greedy partner , Ricardo Montalban , go to investigate a shooting at the home of Dr. Joseph Gotten . Gunned down by the shady doctor , a dying thief tells them that he was trying to lift $500,000 stashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill-gotten gains might as well line the pockets of two hard-working law officers , and conspire to do some Cotten-pickin ' after hours . Their moonlighting ends in a mock-Shakespearean finale . While Montalban overacts outrageously , Ford fires bullets along with a somewhat more lethal barrage of words , words , words . " It is n't the money , " intones Ford . " It never is . It 's people . The things they want , and the things they 'll do to get it . " <P> Overburdened with social significance and sloppy syntax , Trap is chiefly notable for the appearance in a secondary role of onetime glamour girl Rita Hayworth . Rita , frequently cast opposite Ford since they co-starred in Gilda in 1946 , plays a frowzy , pathetic old flame who knows the rackets but preserves all her secrets in booze . Puffy , plainspoken , her veneer meticulously scraped away , Rita at 47 has never looked less like a beauty , or more like an actress . <P> Ten Little Indians is an anemic copy of the 1945 film And Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adaptation of Agatha Christie 's durable whodunit , which was inspired by the nursery rhyme . Unfortunately , nothing has been added but tired blood . <P> The plot remains a model of wicked ingenuity , marooning ten wrongdoers with an anonymous , homicidal host who intends to bring his guests to justice one by one . Properly done , this old-fashioned brand of carnage can hardly miss . The remakers of Indians fail in every impossible way . By shifting the scene from a godforsaken island to an alpine retreat , they are able to engineer a couple of spectacular deaths among the crags , but the mood of boxed-in menace is efficiently destroyed . Held to a laggard pace , such veteran actors as Stanley Holloway , Wilfred Hyde-White and Leo Genn convey the resigned air of specialists summoned too late to be really useful . Mod sex appeal is dragged in by Shirley Eaton , fisticuffs by Hugh O'Brian . And , unlikely as it seems , there is Teen Idol Fabian , quaffing a lethal dose of poison immediately after singing a song . Fabian is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For him , the end comes quickly .
