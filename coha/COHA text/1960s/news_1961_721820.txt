txt WASHINGTON , May 6 ? Alan Shepard 's heavenly lob was not only the happiest homecoming since the prodigal son , but it points up the difference between our scientists and our statesmen . The scientists thought through their whole problem from the countdown to the pick-up . They measured the forces they had against the forces they had to overcome . They not only figured out how to shoot him into space but how to get him back . This is precisely what our statesmen and soldiers did not do in Cuba and Laos . They forgot about the re-entry problems . The Balance of Power The parallel is not precise . Diplomacy is not an exact science , but policy and power have to be balanced in both fields , otherwise there is trouble . Laos is a case in point . United States policy there was to keep the Communists out of that country , but the forces at our command were not balanced against the forces they opposed . The Communists had the power and the will to use it in that region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a common frontier with Laos and a large and growing ground army mobilized close to the battlefield . Meanwhile , Laos had no power of its own and no will to use the power we provided . Thus , as former Vice President Richard M. Nixon said yesterday in Chicago , the lesson Is clear : " We must never talk bigger than we are prepared to act . " This , however , is precisely what we have been doing under both Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy . The Eisenhower Administration gave the commitment to defend Laos . It applied to Southeast Asia the same principle of opposing Communist expansion there as it did in Europe , though the elements of power at our command and the will to use them were far greater in the European area . President Kennedy , stuck with this commitment , asserted that there was no sacrifice we would not make to defend freedom , but again he found it was easier to talk than to act . Thus , for years we have been complaining about " power politics " and " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of politics in the world today , and when the chips are down the balance of power is usually decisive . This is an extremely awkward fact , for it is not only in Laos but in Thailand , South Vietnam and Iran that the balance of power is running against our commitments . The hard question now is whether we are going to increase the power in these regions or decrease the commitments . This , and not Cuba , is the really serious legacy Kennedy has inherited . He could have avoided the Cuban dilemma , for the balance of power is on his side there , but the dilemma across the southern fringe of the Communist empire is another matter . Hard as this is , however , at least it provides the country with an opportunity to reappraise its position in relation to the facts and not in relation to its wishes . The Balance of Policy Immediately after the war , when the . United States had an atomic monopoly , it was in a position to enforce its will in areas close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a policy of halting expansion of ? Communism everywhere , but meanwhile the atomic monopoly has been broken , the balance of power has shifted , but the balance of policy has not shifted with it . We are , in other words , out of kilter , depending on promises that we have not had the will to keep , and which our better judgment told us we should not keep ; and it will probably be a long time , involving more embarrassments and defeats , before this policy can be brought into balance without war . Kennedy knows this and is working night and day on it , which probably explains why he looked so tired yesterday during his news conference . Since the Cuban landings however , he has acted with admirable prudence . He has stood out against those who wanted to smash back into Cuba or Laos . He has moved to put the Central Intelligence Agency in proper harness . . In short , he is now being more orderly and scientific in his procedures than he was last month . The trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure means of return and is bound to do a lot of spinning before he gets down .
