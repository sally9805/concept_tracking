started across the aisle when there was the touch of a hand at his wrist . " Sit down , " said the greatest ballistics missile genius the world had ever known . " Sit down beside me . " And , as North slid down into the seat , Bracht added in a voice barely above a whisper : " I suppose you 're from Security and I told them  --  but I may need you , after all . " Hugh grimaced inwardly at the thought of what G-2 headquarterswould say when it learned that its top operative , Hugh North , had been forced to disclose himself to Hans Bracht as a bodyguard within hours of taking over the assignment of protecting " Mr. Henry Barrows . " That damned Marchet ! Why did a man whom Bracht must have known during those silent years in Southeast Asia have to be on this plane ? From his looks , the Frenchman could not afford many plane trips ; why , oh why , did he have to come aboard this Hong Kong  --  Bangkok airliner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief encounter ; Georges Marchet was no Red agent , whatever else he might be . Even the clumsiest MVD man ( and Hugh had met up with some incredibly heavy-footed specimens ) would have handled his missionbetter than that . Yes , Georges Marchet could be put down for what he was , a French planter with a drug habit , dangerous only because he had recognized Hans Bracht and might tell others who " Mr. Henry Barrows " really was . Not that any Soviet agent on this plane would be likely to need the introduction . No , if Mary Hollberg or Boris Salenkov were on Bracht 's tail , waiting for the chance to put the snatch on the scientist , they would have been fully briefed , they would know their man from the moment they caught sight of him . But if Salenkov and Hollberg were not Red agents , if the Commies had not yet caught up with Bracht , Marchet 's blabbing could be disastrous . Nobody was more untrustworthy than a drug addict ; inp21Bangkok , where there almost certainly must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bracht in places where it could cause real trouble . " You are from Security , are n't you ? " Hans Bracht murmured in an undertone . " I ca n't talk now , " the G-2 colonel said swiftly . " I 'll explain when we get to Bangkok . But I am your friend . " The missile genius turned his large , bespectacled eyes on the colonel , suspicion replacing the fear that had been there . " How do I know ? " he asked bluntly . " Who can I trust ? " Hugh repressed the anger that stirred faintly . This tall , balding man with the faint accent certainly switched from fear to surliness in a hurry . A couple of seconds before he had looked panicstricken ; now he was demanding assurances from the one who had rescued him from Marchet , in a manner of speaking . Remember , this man 's under a strain , Hugh told himself . His wife 's disappearance has cracked him up . " I 'm afraid you 'll just have to take me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and accompanied the remark with a brilliantsmile for the benefit of any eyes that might be watching them . " I 'll show you my credentials in Bangkok . Right now I 'd better get back to my seat . Much safer for both of us . " For a second Bracht seemed on the verge of asking North to stay with him but then the scientist 's lip curled and he turned toward the window . " Go ahead , policeman , " he grunted . " I do n't care what you do . " Hugh kept his smile intact as he got up , nodded cheerily at the back of Bracht 's head , and returned to his seat beside Mary Hollberg . He had expected no effusive thanks from the missile genius , having heard of Bracht 's reputation for rudeness , but there had been a note of something approaching contempt in the other man 's tone that did not sit well with North , however he might hide his resentment . A nice , personable guy , this Hans Bracht . " What was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A policeman ? " " Uh-uh . " Hugh grinned . " Anything but that . He said some/thing about calling a policeman if that fellow bothered him in Bangkok . " It was pretty lame but it would have to do , even though North knew Mary Hollberg was not convinced in the least . The Germangirl eyed him speculatively for a moment before she turned to the window again . North pretended to doze while from beneath his lids he saw the woman beside him revolve the ring with the big emerald around and around a slender finger with the giveawaylong nail . Fraulein Hollberg , then , was doing some heavy thinking . She might even be wondering if she had gotten away with that concert pianist gag . If Mary really was an MVD agent , Moscow must be slipping ; in the old days the Reds would have gotten hold of a real concert pianist for the role , thrown the person she held dearest into the clink , and told the pianist that she would do this job for them or the loved one would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have sent out a wrigglebuttgirl who fell flat on her face the first time she tried to put over her story . There was a new crowd in Russian Intelligence these days , Hugh reminded himself ; perhaps the latest occupants of the seats once held by Beria &; Company had new methods that entailed the use of such agents as Mary Hallberg for reasons yet to be analyzed . Maybe , too , that was why such an obvious Russky as Boris Salenkov was on this job , a downright caricature of what the world thought a Communist commissar looked like . They 'd both bear watching , Mary Hollberg and Boris Salenkov . As though she knew North was speculating on her real role aboard this Bangkok plane , Fraulein Hollberg stirred in her seat , half rose . " Pardon me , mein Herr , " she murmured , and slid past Hugh  --  with what seemed more than necessary pressure of her leg against his knees  --  and went down the aisle to the Ladies ' . Hugh did not turn but he would have liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russian ? Did Boris change that stolid expression one iota when his eyes caught hers ? The G-2 colonel had little time to wonder about this . Hardly had Mary left when Lita Naline arrived , preceded by a wave ofp23some kind of expensive perfume that was overpowering and aphrodisiac . " I 'm sure I 've met you somewhere , " the movie star said , and with no more preface than that moved past North 's knees to drop into Hollberg 's place beside Hugh . Oh hell ! This was getting to be ridiculous . How did a man , even G-2 's most accomplished agent , tell one of the screen 's lovelieststars to move her famed fanny back where it had come from ? Answer : he did n't . Hugh North acted the role of the overwhelmedmale and beamed fatuously upon Miss Lita Naline . She was quite something to beam upon , was Lita . According to her publicity , she was an East Indian , strongly hinted but never baldly claimed as being the natural daughter of a maharajah . Not too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scandal rag which claimed she had been born Lily Novotny in Danbury , Connecticut , but Lita apparently had not let the exposure cramp her style . She affected turban headgears featured by a blazing ruby the size of a hen 's egg and clanking jewelry of Hindu design . She did not , however , go so far as to wear a sari . At present she was clad in satin that might have been a coat of paint and which left nothing of her statistical excellence to Hugh 's imagination . As she pressed a warm hip against North ( the second warm hip to have impressed itself against North 's since this trip began ) she gave him her famous long , lazy smile , dropped her heavily fringed eyes , and murmured : " I know I 'm shameless to be so bold but I had to talk to you . " " Pleasure , I 'm sure , " Hugh gargled in approved style . " I 'm Lita Naline . " " I know , I know . " North gave a snorted giggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Miss Naline . Uh  --  you going back home , are you ? " " Home ? " Lita 's eyebrows shot upward toward the rim of her cloth-of-gold turban . " Oh , you mean India ? Well , no . No , we 're on our way to Thailand "  --  she pronounced it Thay-land  --  " to make an epic , Tiger , Tiger ! Anton and dear Jack and Lex , the four of us , and of course the minor roles and technicians . Thep24crew 's in Bangkok and on location already , some of them , and Anton  --  that 's my fabulous Anton Carss back there , you know  --  Anton says this is going to be his best effort . His very best . He promised me . Dear Poopsy . " She leaned a fraction of an inch closer to Hugh and one of her much publicized statistics burned into his arm . " Did you see The Fleshly and the Doomed ? " she asked . " No  --  uh  --  no , I 'm afraid I missed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fact , North 's duties seldom gave him a chance to see a movie that was not at least ten years old and garnished with native language subtitles screamed at the top of the translator 's voice . Hugh always said that the struggle between an antiquated English sound track and a native translator in full cry was one of the most unnerving experiences known to man . ) " A great pity , " Lita murmured . " They say it was Anton 's best effort since Scum , the one he did in Italy . It was the first time he ever directed me , you know . In Fleshly , I mean . That perfectly silly Italian girl , what's-her-name , was in Scum . And , boy , did she louse it up ! " " Uh-huh , " Hugh nodded solemnly . " I know . " " And you  --  why are you going to Bangkok ? " North spread his hands , hunched his shoulders . " Business , " he explained apologetically . " Oh ? What kind of business ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm afraid , " he said . " Nothing like being a movie star . " He paused and tagged on a heavy gallantry . " The greatest star on the screen today , I might add . " The heavy lashes dropped again . " Why , thank you , " the woman chirruped softly . " But I 'm afraid you 're an awful flatterer , Mr. " Boyden , Charley Boyden , " Hugh supplied . " And I 'm not flatteringyou at all , Miss Naline . Everybody says there never was a star like you . " Which , considering Lita 's record , marital , extramarital , escapadic , and otherwise , was not stretching the truth far , if at all . The girl laid a sharp-nailed hand on his arm and pressed itp25gently . " You 're nice , " she said simply ( and what happened to the big bully ? ) . " I knew you 'd be nice to talk to when I saw you rescue that poor old gentleman "  --  with a nod of the turban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crummy white suit . What was that all about , anyway ? " Hugh resorted to his shrug . " The old fellow was being bothered , " he said . " Maybe the other guy 's drunk . " Lita sniffed . " He certainly acted like he was drunk or on some kind of a kick . " She paused and asked with immense casualness : " What 's the old gent 's name , d' you know ? " " Barrows , I think . " " I 've heard the name before , " the movie star said thoughtfully . " Barrows , Barrows  --  was n't there a producer by that name over at Gargantua before they cleaned house ? " She was off again on her favorite subject . " Not that they should n't have done it years before  --  cleaned house at Gargantua , I mean . Stupendous loaned me to them for a picture once and , my God , it was terrible , but terrible ! The critics were very kind to me but they all said the script and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the director  --  Landow , his name was  --  I said , Landow , if you do n't " Lita , " a gentle voice interrupted . North swiveled his head to look into the smiling eyes of a man who must have been spectacularlyhandsome once and who still retained a quiet , courtly good looks that helped make him one of the highest-priced specialists in motion pictures . This was Lex Ross , once juvenile and leading man to silent screen stars , later a headliner in his own right and , more recently , a smooth , sinister " heavy " who had perfected the art of make-up disguise to a degree never attained since the days of Lon Chaney . At his soft-voiced greeting Lita Naline jumped as though stuck with a pin . She half rose from her seat , the stenographer caught taking a too long coffee break , and then remembered that she was the star of this little caravan and sank back , closer if anything to the G-2 colonel . " Well , what do you want , Lex ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , personally , dear Lita , butp26our guiding genius , the man who 's going to win Oscars for all of us , sent me to tell you to come back to him . " " Him ! " Lita snorted , and almost tossed her turbaned head . " Yes , him . " Lex Ross nodded . " He happens to be a very temperamentalJoe and a very jealous one . Come on , be a good girl and hurry back to Anton before he pops a blood vessel . " Lita hesitated but not for long . " Oh , all right , " she said finally , and surged out of her seat past Hugh . " Honestly , " she complained , " anybody would think he was my husband , the way he orders me around . " She was gone in a swirl of that expensive and titillating perfume . Ross stepped back to let her pass , then followed her , but not before he cast Hugh North one wry , tilted-eyebrow glance . North permitted himself a chuckle . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that life was not going to be an idyllic dream in that Siamese location camp , wherever the superepic Tiger , Tiger ! was going to be filmed . He could imagine Lita in the jungle , reaching for everything in pants while her " fabulous "  --  and jealous  --  producer-director-lover stewed in something more than the heat . He was glad his duty consisted of merely protecting an invaluable missile genius from the Reds and did not include having to join that little menage somewhere in Thailand . His thoughts returned to Hans Bracht . Speaking of temperament , he had on his hands a genius who could rival Anton Carss in that department . Bracht had long been noted for his ability to hurt , frustrate , and infuriate everybody who had tried to work with him . His associates in the field of nuclear physics and electronicsadmitted that he was the greatest among them , but none too privately they named him the scientific equivalent of an ornery sonofabitch . He possessed a terrific ego , which , North conceded , he might have a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection in his subordinates , and many a young scientist had been utterly demolished while trying to work with Bracht . The missile genius had no friends and quite obviously wanted none ; his backgroundp27was dominated by the fact that all his life Bracht had been a lone wolf by preference . Except in the case of Tao Muong , and Hugh dwelt on the runaway wife for a moment . The information with which G-2 headquarters had supplied him said that little was known of Tao Muong beyond the fact that the girl was very beautiful , even for a Siamese woman , long noted for their adorable doll-like qualities . It was thought possible that Muong might be a Eurasian or an Annamite , a native of Indochina ; her features were not quite so oriental as the average Thai 's . Where Bracht had found her , even where and when they had been married , was not known . The strange alliance was part of the blank period in Bracht 's life which the scientist guarded as his own secret . It was a secret that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the investigation agencies of practically every other nation in the world , had failed to crack . Conjecturesmight be a dime a dozen , but not one provable fact was on the books as to where Hans Bracht had been or what he had done between the time he had disappeared from Hitler 's rocket laboratories until the day he had emerged from hiding in Bangkok . Upon his disclosure of his identity authorities had been so incredulousthat at first the bearded man was considered a crackbrainedimpostor . Bracht had soon banished all doubts by his work , the touch of the master in all things having to do with ballistics missiles . But how he had escaped Germany , how he had survived , how and why he had made his way to Siam  --  these were questions that never had come close to being answered . Hugh told himself now that aside from being a fascinating subject the hiatus in Bracht 's life , per se , was none of his concern . His job was to see that the genius got to Bangkok alive and free , that Bracht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wife  --  or at least Bracht  --  was delivered home again safe and sound . North considered this a big enough order without trying to crack the secret of those hidden years in Bracht 's life.  | " Still , " the G-2 agent murmured under his breath as he stared sightlessly at the pages of his magazine , " it looks as though those mysterious years are mixed up in this case already  --  as witness Monsieur Marchet. "  |p29The  airliner dipped a wingand began a long turn . Hugh looked at the lights that wheeled below . Down there was Bangkok 's Don Muang Airport , one of the busiest air terminals in the world . Down there , too , was danger to Dr. Hans Bracht , who , while he could mean success or failure to America 's intercontinental ballistics missile plans , was not only the elderly husband panting after the beautiful runaway wife . Hugh had long since concluded that Bracht would be dangerouslyvulnerable during the landing at Don Muang . It was night , there would be an inevitable confusion at the busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could find it relativelyeasy to do his work . Second , there was a longish trip from Don Muang to the city of Bangkok itself , a trip that hadp30made North shudder . If the Reds knew of Bracht 's arrival they would have plenty of chances to stage an ambush . When he got Bracht into Bangkok the danger would be lessenedbut not by much . G-2 headquarters had learned that Bracht would stay at the Imperial ( and had arranged for an adjoining room for North ) , and while the Imperial was a beautiful luxury hotel it never had been built with an eye toward permitting an Intelligence agent easy coverage of his man . There were a dozen entrances to the big building , some of them leading into the livingquarters of the hotel without going near the lobby . Many of the upper rooms and suites were connected by balconies which in effect provided second hallways for persons who might want to prowl the place unseen . There was the usual profusion of servantsfound in every oriental hotel , operating on a system that required a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility that the Reds might slip one or more Asian agents in among them . The hotel proposed enough problems to give a splittingheadache to the person who had to know what his ward or quarry was doing at any given moment  --  that , Hugh North had found out by personal experience years before . Then there were the Thai law-enforcement agencies . Hugh would have been among the first to acknowledge that since World War II the little country of Thailand had come far in modernizing herself in nearly every way , but the question was whether the Siamese had improved their old , venal , inefficient police system enough to be of any real help in protecting Hans Bracht from the agents of the Kremlin , if called upon . One factor in favor of this possibility was the location of the South East Asia Treaty Organization 's headquarters in Bangkok ; certainly the Thai police must have been reorganized , modernized , to some extentto safeguard the important personages who attended the SEATO sessions . The Pentagon had informed North that a General Genung was chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a city army , apart from but co-ordinated with the regular Thai Army . Hugh 's instructions had been to avoid calling on Genung for assistance if at all possible ( the preservation ofp31Bracht 's incognito again ) but to be assured of friendly aid to the limit of the troops ' capability if an emergency required a call . G-2 headquarters did not say so , but the inference was there : do n't expect too much . North shrugged mentally as the plane began its descent . He would have to play it by ear and trust to luck  --  that , and hope that Bracht was so uncharacteristically scared , as he had appeared to be for that moment when Marchet had confronted him , that he would co-operate . Not much ; just enough to possibly save his own life . " You have been in Bangkok before , mein Herr ? " Mary Hollbergasked as the airliner began sloping down toward Don Muang . " A few times , " North said briefly . " Have you ? " " No . " The girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I have never been in Siam and I confess I am frightened . Is it a  --  a jungle country , Herr Boyden ? Will I be trampled by elephants , attacked by tigers ? " " Not in Bangkok , " Hugh laughed . " Is someone meeting you ? " Another headshake . " No , I will be all alone unless some kind gentleman rescues me . " There was the invitation : I 'm all yours to tuck under your wing . " But surely the people who arranged your concert must be going to have somebody meet you , " North could not resist saying . Mary recognized the slip and attempted to recover . " Oh , them I have forgotten , " she acknowledged . " Yes , probably they will have somebody to meet me . " " By the way , where are you appearing in Bangkok ? " North continued . A shrug . " That I leave up to the people who arrange the performance . I do not bother with such things . They have told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No doubt the Prajadhapok , " Hugh suggested . " All the better artists give their concerts there . " Fraulein Hollberg studied the G-2 colonel with a long glance that told North he had gone too far . Now Mary knew that he knew she was no concert pianist because Mary Hollberg had been in Bangkok before and realized there was no Prajadhapokp32Theater . If Mary Hollberg had made a slip , Hugh North had made one too . He waited , his face reflecting none of the cursing he was givinghimself for overplaying his hand . And Mary Hollberg , whoevershe really was , proved equal to the occasion . " I do not think that is the name of the place , " she said dubiously , " but it may be . All these strange names out here confuseme so . But I do know that I will stay at the Hotel Imperial . You too ? " North nodded , and the girl gave a tiny crow of delight . " Then I shall have a friend in Bangkok after all , " she exulted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will give you a drink . " She put a hand to her mouth in winsome dismay . " But that would be indiscreet , nicht wahr ? What is the custom of this country  --  does the gentleman call on the lady in her room or does she call on him in his ? " " I 'm not sure that either is strictly proper "  --  North smiled  --  " but in the case of a concert pianist I 'm sure the Imperial will stretch the rules . " " Then it is a date , " Mary Hollberg said gleefully . " You will phone me at the Imperial and we shall get to know each other better . Much better . " " I 'll do my very best , " North promised solemnly . And meant every word of it . The night landing at Don Muang brought with it a chaos provided by Lita Naline 's presence . Lita 's publicity men apparently worked under the threat that if Lita should ever arrive anywhere or leave anyplace without the greeting or farewell of a screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kong , Hugh had watched Lita wave good-by to a seethingcaldron of humanity which shouted ecstatic godspeeds in English , Mandarin Chinese , and Cantonese . Here at Don Muang was an identical mob with an identical enthusiasm , although here the shouts were in Siamese , with a sprinkling of Chinese and a few words cried in broken English . This swirling mass broke past the barriers at the edge of the field and descended on Lita'sp33plane in a howling avalanche while airport officials cursed , yelled pleas and threats , and finally announced in French , English , and the native language ( of which North knew barely a smattering ) that Miss Naline would remain aboard the airplane until all personsnot authorized on the field were back behind the fence , even if the waiting took all night . Aboard the plane , Miss Naline expressed energetic disapproval of this ultimatum . " These dear , dear people have come here to see me and what right has some lousy Bangkok jerk to deny them the privilege ? " she cried in rich , throaty tones . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet my public ! " Anton Carss moved his bulging self up beside Naline and took one of her hands between his . " But what if this  --  ah  --  demonstration of affection should get out of hand ? " he asked . " What if you were injured ? Imagine an unlucky accident , a broken nose " " Jesus ! " squealed Miss Lita Naline . " Me get my face messed up ? Not on your life ! " " Of course not , " Carss said soothingly . " For then there would be no epic , no world recognition of my Lita as the greatest actress Carss has ever directed , no chance for Lita to show the Italian that she is far greater " Somebody do something , " Lita said hoarsely . " Get those goddamn maniacs off the field . " " Go out and sing to them , sweetheart , " John Wallen , Lita 's leading man , sniggered . " That 'll drive ' em to cover fast enough . " Hugh , standing in the aisle to block any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloud at Lita 's expression . The siren with the jeweled turban faced " dear Jack " with a glare gone ashen with fury . Wallen sneered back at her , his toohandsome , aquiline features a mask of jealous contempt . " Listen , you . . . " the self-publicized maharajah 's daughter began , and proceeded to tell John Wallen what he could do with his suggestion , plus a few recommendations for further activities along strange lines . She used terms that made Hugh North wince and Mary Hollberg gasp . Anton Carss stepped in again . " Let me go out and  --  ah  --  see if I can find somebody whop34has control over this crowd , " he said . " The fans wo n't molest me . " A dramatically pathetic shrug . " They wo n't even know me . " " Sure , Anton . " Wallen laughed . " Find the bright boy who staged this and tell him to pay off the hired cheering section and send ' em home . " Miss Naline had a few more words to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a spontaneous tribute . While she was so engaged , Carss spoke to the stewardess urgently and was allowed to leave the plane . North bent to look out a window . He saw the pudgy director plunge into the crowd and wedge his way to the rear of the throng where two white men who looked like Americans stood . There was an earnest conversationduring which Carss waved his hands . Out of the knot of irked , impatient , or amused passengers came a small round man who approached North , smiling . It was the goateed patent-medicine king , Chu Hoong , concocter of that cureallof unequaled potency , Dragon 's Tooth Elixir . " Excuse me , " he said to North , " but does it happen that you understand Siamese ? You have the look of one who has traveled much and I must find someone to share my amusement . " Hugh went on guard instinctively . It might possibly be true that this multimillionaire Chinese had wedged his way the length of the plane merely to share a joke with somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveler , but it was not probable . Brother Chu had something on his mind besides seekingcompanionship for a laugh . North edged himself a bit to the left to shield Hans Bracht 's chair more completely . " I 'm very weak in Siamese , " he told Chu . " What 's the joke ? " The Chinese tilted his head to one side , listening , and then shook it regretfully . " Ah , they have closed the door again and you can not distinguish the words , " he said sorrowfully . " While it was open I heard enough to decide that joyous excitement must have unhinged that crowd outside . What they were shouting was , liberally translated : Let the shameless foreign bitch show herself so we can get our pay . " He appeared to realize suddenly that Mary Hollberg was within hearing distance and turned toward the German " pianist , "  |p35his  hands folded on his chest , his head bowed . " Ah , try to forgivethis unworthy one 's shocking language , honorable lady , " he begged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . " The pretty blonde Friiulein curved her mouth in a smile that revealed a dimple . " You 're forgiven , " she told Chu . " Perhaps I , too , wish Miss Naline would show herself to the crowd so they 'd go away and we could get out of here . " " The lady is too kind . I am ashamed to -- Chu Hoong 's voice was cut off as though a needle had been lifted from a phonograph record . Hugh North saw the Chinese patent-medicine king gape at a point just beyond him , his jaw dropping , his eyes reflecting a surprise that was entirely out of keeping with the cultured Oriental 's unshakable composure . Hugh turned and saw the reason for this startling change . Behindhim , Hans Bracht had risen from his seat and had moved so that Chu Hoong had come face to face with him . Bracht had reacted almost as violently as had Chu . The tall , balding scientist staggered back a step against the seat in front of his and put out a long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak , but the Chinese beat him to it with just one word : " You ! " So saying , and before Bracht could have spoken if he would , Chu Hoong turned and wedged his way back down the aisle toward the rear of the plane . Only once did he venture a look over his shoulder , and when he did , Hugh North saw fear reflected in the multimillionaire 's slanted almond eyes . Now , what the hell ? The G-2 colonel might have noticed nothing , for all his expressionwould have told an onlooker , but his brain was clicking off conclusions , questions , conjectures . First , these two men , the world 's greatest space-travel authority and a Chinese patent-medicine magnate , knew each other and feared each other.  |p36Second  , Chu had not come to the front of the plane to see Bracht ; his surprise had been as complete as the doctor 's when the scientist had risen from his seat and faced the Chinese . That meant that Chu Hoong had offered his conversational gambit about the crowd 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugh North the person , and not Bracht 's bodyguard . Hugh had never seen Chu before in his life until this flight . Then why would the Chinese want to talk to him if not because of Bracht ? Possible answer : it had something to do with North 's tangle with Georges Marchet . And how about Miss Concert Pianist ? She had been aft , passingthe place where Chu had been sitting ; could she have arrangedsomething ? Fraulein Hollberg was edging past him , down the aisle . " The crowd outside is breaking up , " she told North . " Do n't forget to call me at the Imperial . " And she was gone after Chu . Hans Bracht had sat down again and was staring bleakly out his window at the floodlighted field . Unbidden , the G-2 colonel sat down beside him and looked past the scientist to see that the two Americans to whom Carss had appealed apparently had told their charges that payoff time was at hand . A couple of Pied Pipers in Western business suits , the publicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club off the field . The passengers aboard the Thai airliner moved toward the exit , the siege lifted at last . Hugh saw that Georges Marchet was the first to disembark , pushing past Lita , who was preening herself for the flash bulbs that waited to flicker . The planter hurried down the steps , through the knot of newsmen gathered to welcome Naline , and plunged off , head bent , toward the customs shed . Miss Naline came next and posed prettily on the landing stage while the flash bulbs popped . She was followed by Wallen and Ross , who stood with her for a single shot ( arms entwined and smiling chummily , three dear friends off on a lark ) before the trio moved toward customs . Then followed the Russian , Boris Salenkov , Chu Hoong , and , at the very end of the line behind thep37least important underling of the Tiger , Tiger ! company , Mary Hollberg . As he watched , Hugh saw the German girl turn and glance back at the big aircraft , her eyes seeking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonel wondered again what game Fraulein Hollberg was playing . Could she be some new type of Russian agent or  --  and North nearly laughed aloud as the ridiculously obvious explanation came to him  --  was she merely an international trollop using the airlines as her beat and doing very well off the proceeds of customers she might pick up on the continent-spanning planes ? Surely she had been forwardenough with her invitations , and what better role to travel under than that of a concert pianist ? This last theory would explain Mary 's interest in that overheardword of Bracht 's , policeman ! If she was a high-flying fine de joie it was probable that there had been some incidents in her past that would make the word policeman an unwelcome one . You 're starting to see Russian bogeymen under the bed when you mistake a high-class chippy for a Red agent , the Intelligence officer warned himself . He checked the airfield again and saw that the immediate vicinitywas deserted except for the airliner 's crew , unloading luggageand mail . All the men were intent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's all right to leave the plane now , sir , " he told Bracht .

" I was promised that no security men would bother me on this trip and I do n't intend It was North 's turn to break in . " Listen , Doctor , " he said evenly , " that was n't a security man bothering you a few minutes ago . It was a Frenchman named Georges Marchet who recognized you without your beard and was ready to blat your name to everybody within earshot . Marchet 's probably in customs now , and if I 'm not with you he might smash this incognito of yours all to hell . I 'm pretty sure the man 's a drug addict and  | " He is , " Bracht grunted . " Ach , Gott , how I hate that tribe , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addicts you know how undependablethey are , " Hugh went on . " Think about the importance of keeping your identity secret , sir . If it got out that Hans Brachtwas in Bangkok "  --  not that the odds are n't ten to one that the Reds already know it , he added silently  --  " there 'd almost surely be trouble . You 're getting close to your wife  --  do n't ruin everythingnow by refusing to co-operate with me . " It worked . Bracht lost his sneer , his contemptuous disdain . Suddenly the scientist 's fear showed in his long face again as plainly as before and again Hugh wondered . How could a man of Bracht 's toughness , a man capable of risking death by torture as he had when he had escaped from under Hitler 's nose , be so shaken now ? " All right , all right , " the missile expert mumbled as his eyes dropped . " I'll -- co-operate . " " Good , " Hugh said briskly . " Now follow me and keep close . " Bracht nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aisle behind North . The two men had just reached the ground at the foot of the landing stage and North was replying to the stewardess 's good-by when a figure stepped out of the shadow cast by the plane 's tail assembly . " Doctah Bracht ! " a voice rapped out . " Hol ' it , pliss ! " Hugh whirled himself in front of Bracht . The G-2 colonel caught a glimpse of a man raising something , aiming something . Hugh 's gun was in his hand , his finger tightening , when he realizedwhat was happening . He held the shot that would have drilled the accoster 's head and then there was a blinding flash of light . Hugh cursed under his breath as his gun flowed back into its shoulder holster . Somebody leaving the airliner had told one ofp39the news photographers assembled to greet Lita Naline that Dr. Hans Bracht was aboard the plane . Marchet ! " Gott im Himmel ! " Bracht exclaimed , beside Hugh . " It 's okay , " the colonel said tersely . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid dog ! " Bracht blazed . " Just let me get my hands on him and I 'll " I said I 'd handle it ! " North crackled . He advanced toward the photographer , who was reversing the plateholder . The cameramanwho had come so close to being killed proved to be a youngster , a Eurasian by his looks in this uncertain light , who now wore an aggrieved frown . " You spoil picture , " he complained . " I pay Frenchman one hundedd bahts for tip famous scientist on plane and you spoil picture . " " If you paid anybody a hundred bahts for a bum steer , that 's your lookout . " North smiled . " The gentleman with me is Mr. Henry Barrows . " " No savvy bum steer , " the cameraman scowled . He began trying to edge around North for another shot at Bracht . Hugh blocked the little man 's view again . " I would n't take any more pictures if I were you , " he said . " General Genung would n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savvied , all right . At mention of the general 's name the little fellow abruptly abandoned his flanking movement , lowered his camera . Astonishingly , he emptied his old Graphic of the plateholder and proffered the oblong to Hugh . " Here you are , gentleman , " he twittered . " You see I do nothingGeneral Genung don ' like . You tell General Genung I most pleasant , agreeable man , oh yes . Good-by , pliss . " He was off , gone in the shadows , leaving North with the plateholderthat contained a negative which must show a tall , wideshoulderedG-2 colonel bearing down with a .38 pistol . North laughed as he slid the slides out of the plateholder , exposingboth films , and then replaced them . He deposited the wooden-framed oblong on the cement apron in the event the most pleasant , agreeable photographer dared return for his propertyp40and rejoined Bracht . The scientist regarded him with murky eyes . " You should have given him a swift kick in the Schwanz , " he grumbled . " News photographers are strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like being kicked in the tail . When somebody kicks them or otherwise roughs them up they usually get even the best way they know how . I do n't imagine you 'd want to be dogged by a passel of Siamese cameramen during your stay here , and that 's what would have happened if I 'd followed your suggestion . The word would have gone out that we were tough guys when it came to having our picture taken , and cameramen  --  I do n't care whether they 're Siamese or Siberian  --  always have to prove that nobody 's too tough to be photographed . " Bracht grunted , " How did you get that little worm to run off like that ? " " I mentioned a name  --  what appears to be a magic name in Thailand . " North smiled . " And , believe me , I 'm glad to know it wields such authority . We may have to use that name on somebodymore important than an enterprising cameraman . This way , please . " Bracht grunted again but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the customs shed and then he asked : " Was that photographer one of Lita 's publicity crowd ? " Hugh hid his surprise at Bracht 's mention of the star 's first name . " I do n't think so , " he said . " He acted more like a news cameraman . " He laughed in an attempt to improve the dour relations that existed between him and the man he had been detailedto guard . " Quite a performance Lita put on back there in the plane , was n't it ? " he asked . " One minute she was ready to swan-dive into that mob and then she was yelling for somebody to get those maniacs off the field . " Again Hans Bracht did the unexpected ; he defended the volatileMiss Naline . " What Anton Carss told her made sense , " he said somberly . " Suppose there had been an accident and her beauty was ruined . " He looked at North , his face haggard . " Can you imagine how a beautiful woman would feel to be disfigured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her ? "  |p41Colonel  North 's face did not change . There was not the slightest indication that within him there was a sudden , surging , silent cry : So that 's it ! Hugh and Hans Bracht went through customs without a hitch , North at the scientist 's side , his eyes always roving , his right hand always free and never far from the butt of that hidden .38 . The reason North had chosen " Boyden " as a pseudonym was to be as close as possible to Bracht- " Barrows " in all such situations where an alphabetical grouping might occur , and if one could take the lack of any untoward incident as proof , the foresight had been a wise one . Both missile genius and G-2 colonel were shot through a cursory customs inspection without delay at the " B " counter . But if their move through customs was smooth , Lita Naline 's was n't , to judge by the uproar that arose from down the line under the big letter " N. " Lita was in full cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still going strong when they moved out onto the platform where the taxis waited . " A little temperamental , eh ? " North laughed with a jerk of his head toward the sound and the fury behind them . " I pity Anton Carss when they 're in the jungle making that picture . " " Oh , Carss will handle her , " Bracht said . " He 's done wonders directing more difficult stars than Lita . " This time Hugh could not hide his surprise as he glanced at the scientist . " Do n't tell me you 're a movie fan , " he grinned . The greatest space-travel authority in the world answered in a grating voice that lacked any hint of apology or embarrassment . " Not me , my wife , " he explained . " She  --  she has eye trouble , so I must read the movie columns and the fan magazines to her . " He paused and then added in a soft voice North had not heard him use before : " Poor little thing , the movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He caught himself and added hastily : " Her eyes , you see . "  | " Tough , " North sympathized . He got the picture of this worldfamousfigure , this top man of all space scientists , sitting at home patiently reading aloud from the frothy movie magazines his beautiful young wife , Tao Muong , could not translate if , indeed , she could read her own language . Hans Bracht had done this in the hope of keeping her contented , and to Hugh the incongruous picture was a sad one . " Here 's our cab , " the colonel offered into the brief silence that had fallen . Bracht preceded Hugh into the rickety vehicle that slumped , fourth in the taxi line . The scientist had no complaints to make about North 's choice of a cab , the shabbiest of the lot , and if he had Hugh could hardly have explained that he was merely followinga G-2 agent 's pattern , laid down by experience . Never take the first cab in line ; They might have provided it . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect you to pass up the first and have two waiting . They might even have three cabs in a line but hardly more than three . The fourth was as safe as any , as far as being a planted cab was concerned , but to confuse anybody who might be following the agent 's choice of cabs over a space of time , the rule was to mix them up , sometimes taking the fifth , sometimes the seventh , sometimes ( but not often because it was too easily appended to a waiting cab line in quick switch ) the last cab in the lot . This taxi Hugh chose at the Don Muang Airport was a real veteran , a British Panhard of prewar vintage with fenders that seemed to flap even before the machine moved . " Imperial Hotel , " the G-2 officer told the driver , and they were off in a clatter of fouled sparkplugs , carbon-choked cylinders , and cricket-chorusing squeaks . Don Muang Airport lay several miles upriver on the Men am Chao Phya , and because it was night , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugh North hoped to use the trip to gain Hans Bracht 's confidence , if possible . The driver of the antiquated cab probably had his accelerator down to the floor in the clear stretches , but even then his wheezy cab could only limp along and the clear stretches were few and far between . Thep43Siamese quite obviously had shed the superstitions that once had kept them indoors after nightfall out of fear of demons ; the Don Muang  --  Bangkok road was cluttered with traffic even at this time of night . Oxcarts , automobiles , lumbering trucks , and an occasionalponderous elephant moved up and down the highway with a total disregard of the rules of the road . North 's driver kept his horn squawking almost continuously , not that anyone , human , bovine , or elephantine , paid him the least mind , and the taxi more or less inched its way toward Bangkok . Hugh realized it was the perfect setup for an ambush , the snatching of Hans Bracht out of his cab during one of the innumerabletraffic jams or a shot out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodyguard . Under such conditions it was impossible to guard against such a possibility ; North had to ride out this trip wheel turn by wheel turn and hope he could meet and parry the stab in the dark when and if it came . " Ca n't we go faster ? " Bracht fretted . " I 've got to get to the hotel before midnight . Somebody might call . " His eyes met North 's squarely . " I wo n't tell you who , " he added defiantly . " That 's up to you , " Hugh said lightly . " And just who are you ? " the scientist demanded . " You said aboard the plane you 'd tell me when we landed . " Hugh nodded . It was time to tell Bracht who he was . His orders had been to keep the doctor from knowing he was being covered , but those orders , like all instructions given undercover agents , were open to change to meet urgencies and exigencies . North had always been given a great deal of latitude in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to strike off at a tangent oppositeto the strict letter of his orders brought him a chewing-out from higher headquarters . He hoped he was right this time too . The noise outside the cab was tumultuous , helped along in no little measure by the horn of their own cab . Still , the colonel pitched his voice low , at the exact level that could be heard by Bracht and not by the taxi driver , no matter how rabbit-eared or what kind of English linguist that worthy might be . " Colonel Hugh North , Army Intelligence , " he told his ward.  | " Assigned as your companion , Dr. Bracht , until you 're safely back in the States . " " They promised me there 'd be no guards , " Bracht muttered . North sighed . Bracht ought to be getting tired of the tune he fiddled on that one string . " If you 'll remember , " he said , " your demands were that no security guards be put on your tail . You 'll probably call it splitting hairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no security guards . I 'm not from Security . I 'm Army G-2 . The Army has a big stake in you , Doctor , just as the country and for that matter the whole free world has . You 're head of Army 's Project Galaxy . We do n't want anything to happen to you . " And could not resist adding : " At least not until Project Galaxy is a success . " " And after that ? " Bracht grunted . Hugh was reaching for his cigarettes . " Seems to me we 've got enough to do without looking that far ahead . " The scientist fell silent on the cracked leather seat beside North , staring ahead moodily , oblivious to the sights , the sounds , the smells that surrounded him . A full minute passed before he asked : " You do not like me , eh , Colonel ? " North shrugged . " In my business a man can seldom afford personal likes and dislikes . Until I get you back to the States I 'm going to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easier on both of us if we could get along amiably , if not cordially . " He considered his next statement and decided on it against certain qualms . " It might help if you 'd remember that just as you 're an expert in your field I 'm pretty experienced in mine . Let me be the expert until you 're back in your laboratory . Let me do the masterminding for both of us . And , above all , level with me , Doctor . " " Level with you ? " " Be honest . Do n't try to play it your way . Do n't go it alone . Confide in me . If you knew me better you 'd know I never broke a confidence in my life . I could n't afford to . Let it get out that North broke his word and my career would n't be worth a plugged nickel  --  not to speak of my neck . "  |p45Bracht  looked down at his big hands twisting in his lap . " Words are cheap , " he grumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . He paused and when he spoke again he used German , a double precaution against some incredibly sharp-eared , English-speaking taxi driver . " Or do you prefer to take the word of the people who kidnaped your wife ? " he asked calmly . The results were electric . Hans Bracht 's long , lean body was transfixed by shock . He stared at the G-2 colonel , his protuberant eyes wide behind their glasses , his thin-lipped mouth agape . " You know ? " he gasped finally . " You know they stole Tao Muong ? " He turned in his seat , and his spatulate hands shot out to grasp North 's arm , his fingers biting . " How ? " he demanded fiercely . " How did you find out ? Was it something I said ? They warned me that if I breathed a word they 'd maim her , torture her , kill her ! " " Easy , " North counseled . " Take it easy . " Bracht flung himself away and crumpled in his corner , the unnervedruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he half sobbed . " It 's fine for you to tell me that , but those devils have my wife . Unless I do what they say , Muong will " He choked , staring down at his trembling hands , surrendered to his fear again . Fear , Hugh knew now , for Tao Muong , never for Hans Bracht . Now the G-2 agent knew why Bracht had crumpled before Marcher 's question , Chu Hoong 's recognition ; the missile genius had been terrified that Marcher 's appearance , and Chu Hoong 's , might wreck his deal with Muong 's kidnapers . Regardless of what lay behind the Chinese multimillionaire 's own fear , Bracht had been panicked only by the thought that these unlucky meetings ( if that was what they had been ) would be witnessed by a tail , the snatchers would suspect some kind of double cross , and Muong would be mutilated . Hugh told himself that this poor devil , Hans Bracht , must always be seeing his wife in the kidnapers ' hands ; his imagination must paint scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was genuine sympathy in the colonel 's voice when hep46spoke . " Doctor , believe me when I say that until you get your wife back I 'll do my best to keep hands off any deals you 've made with the kidnapers . That 's a promise . " The scientist 's bald , friz-fringed head swung around slowly . " Can I really believe that ? " he asked . He chewed his lower lip for a moment and then added : " What do you mean exactly  --  you 'll do your best to keep hands off ? " North winced inwardly at the second question . It might be the cardinal rule of all law-enforcement officers , from the precinct cop up to the FBI , to let kidnapers operate with a free hand until the ransom was paid or the snatch victim found , dead or alive , but international secret agents were not bound by that rule . G-2 and comparable agencies sometimes  --  indeed usually  --  played for higher stakes than the life of one person . Tao Muong might be an adorable young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of angered or scared kidnapers , but against the life of the world 's greatest intercontinental ballistics missile genius the life of a little Siamese girl was an inconsequential thing , actually . " Put it this way , " he said finally . " My first job is to keep you alive and out of the hands of our enemies , to get you back to Project Galaxy as soon as possible . If a fast deal with the kidnapers will expedite that , it stands to reason I 'll help in any way I can to arrange the ransom payoff and get your wife returned . " But this is no ordinary snatch , he added silently , bitterly . The ransom they want is Hans Bracht . And when they try to collect I may have to forget there ever was such a person as Tao Muong . Bracht was pondering what North had told him and , as the taxi jolted ahead in a sudden , miraculous spurt , he nodded slowly . " That makes sense , " he said in a low voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they 'll know ! " he exclaimed . " They told me they 'd watchevery move I made . They 'll know you 're from this  --  this ArmyIntelligence or whatever it is . They said not to talk to anybody . " " I 'd say no to any kidnaper knowing who I am , " Hugh offeredreassuringly . " My work has been with the Army . This is a specialcase and I 'm on it only because you 're working on an Armyp47missile project . If I were so well known that a kidnap gang would recognize me I would n't be of much use to the Army , would I ? No , Doctor , kidnapers will be looking for police , not Army G-2 . " If they 're just kidnapers , that is , he told himself . If they 're bigger game they might be looking out for somebody like me , but that 's a chance we 'll have to take . " Suppose the kidnapers did have somebody on that plane , " he went on to Bracht . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearest passenger and the logical man to step in . What could be more understandable than that I struck up a conversation with you after the incident ? " It was hard going , but Hugh got through to the missile genius beside him . By this time the G-2 colonel had decided that Hans Bracht desperately wanted a friend , an ally , in his terrible predicament . He might be a Prussian drillmaster in his laboratory , but in the outside world that he had always shunned ( except for that mysterious hiatus ) , and tormented as he was by fears for his wife , he must have welcomed the offer of help that came from North , even against all his doubts and misgivings . He inclinedhis long head in a nod once more , so grudgingly that Hugh almost expected to hear a creak . " All right , " he said heavily . " All right , Colonel North , I 'll " First , you 'll call me Charley Boyden , " North interposed . " That was my name back on the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grimaced . " I hope I remember . I am no good at this . " You must have been once , when you were getting out of Hitler 's Germany . Aloud , Hugh said easily : " Do n't worry about me . I said I intended to stick closer than a brother and I will , but that does n't mean I 'll be underfoot . This possibly is the last time we 'll be seen together in public "  --  he looked at the roof of the shabby cab , the back of the driver 's head , and grinned  --  " if this can be called public . When we get to the Imperial I 'll fade into the background as much as possible . I 'll contact you and I 'll keep an eye on you but I wo n't clutter up the picture  --  not if I work it right . "  |p48The  cab rattled and banged its way over the bridges of innumerablecanals into the outskirts of Bangkok 's Samsen district , an area featured by vast parks and the imposing Parliament Building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The street traffic was still thick and now the pedestrian flow grew more turbulent . An occasional street lamp cast a wan glow that showed Hugh the polyglot dress worn by these people of Thailand . Some were clad in the native garb of short loose trousers or sarong , with sleeveless jackets for the men and diaper-type pantaloons for the women . Others wore Western clothes of the outmoded , garish type . A few were smartly dressed in the latest Western fashion , but these were greatly outnumbered by the men and women in native costume . The taxi edged past a couple of tramcars which seemed to be making no better progress than was permitted by the occasional elephant that invariably ambled down the middle of the tracks , its mahout seeming to dare the bell-clanging , cursing streetcar motorman to do anything more than make a lot of useless noise . Despite Thailand 's progress within recent years it was evident that the elephant had lost none of its honorable position in Siam ; the people still revered the great beast as an emblem of authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as still the greatest source of locomotive power , all hydroelectric projects , turbine engines , and gasoline motors notwithstanding . Hugh North always marveled at the constant refutation of Kipling 's " Never the twain shall meet " in these little Southeast Asian countries which had taken such tremendous strides toward modernity in the past decade . East certainly did meet West in Bangkok , as it did in Singapore , Karachi , Saigon , and other like cities that Hugh had visited in the pursuit of his duties . The intermingling of the two opposite cultures went deeper than in such things as dress and machines ; it was the G-2 colonel 's opinion that the old maxim about the East 's inscrutability was being made more passe every day . The Siamese , like the Vietnamese , the Cambodians , and their oriental cousins , had too long let the world mistake ignorance , superstition , and oppression byp49their rulers as inscrutability . Now they were tasting freedom , progress , opportunity , and they were reacting to these new-found delights as typically as any European or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned his attention back to his ward . " We have n't got much more time alone . I 've got a couple of questions . First , who is Georges Marchet and where did he know you ? " Bracht 's lower lip pushed out obstinately . " I wo n't tell you . " North held his temper in check . " Then where did you meet Chu Hoong ? Why is he afraid of you ? " " I never met anybody named Chu Hoong in my life . " " I asked you to be honest with me , " the colonel reminded the scientist . " I am being honest . If you mean that Chinese , if I ever knew him it was n't under the name of Chu Hoong . As for Marchet , he has nothing to do with the kidnaping , not that drug-sodden worm . " " Let me decide whether or not he 's important to us . Who is he and where did you know him ? " North watched the space-travel genius wrestle with his doubts , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had preserved for so many years . " Marchet would not have the courage to be mixed up with anything even so cowardly as the kidnaping of a little girl , " he said finally . " He has been a Raucher , a smoker , for years and by now he has probably gone down the scale to worse drugs  --  if such nasty things can be graded . " " And you knew him when you were out here ? " Hugh prodded . " During the war , after you left Germany ? " The long head inclined in the barest suggestion of a nod . " In Siam ? " This time there was a grudging negative headshake . " No , Marchet was in French Indochina , now Vietnam , " the doctor said . " I  --  I was passing through and Hugh North flung both arms around Hans Bracht and bore him down off the seat onto the littered floor of the cab . The nextp50second there was a rending , ripping , grinding bedlam as a big black Citroen that had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the curb , across the sidewalk , and up against a tree in a park that bordered the street.  |p51Hugh  's first thought was thatwhoever had arranged the ramming had chosen the spot well . While he had been trying to drag explanations out of Hans Bracht the cab had turned off the crowded main thoroughfare onto a dark , empty side street that skirted a black stretch of park , and the driver of the Citroen had not wasted a second when he saw the coast was clear . The taxi driver ? Had They outwitted him and planted an agent at the wheel of this rickety cab , outguessed him by stationing the stooge in the fourth position of the taxi rank at Don Muang Airport ? If the cab driver was a Red agent he had been doublecrossed , too ; the tree trunk the cab had smashed into had crushed the driver 's head and now the threadbare little man sagged over the wheel , dead . The collision 's impact had sent the door on Bracht 's side flyingp52off its hinges as the cab slewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Hugh released his grip and shoved himself upright , his hand darting beneath his jacket to emerge with his gun . Hans Bracht did not hesitate . The missile expert scrambled through the gaping doorway on hands and knees and dropped to the grass with an agility that belied his years . " Hold it ! " North barked . " Do n't panic now ! " The scientist got to his feet and stared about wildly . The crash , coming on top of everything else , seemed likely to snap the tenuous hold Bracht had on himself , and North lunged at his man to grab him and shield him from whatever might be about to follow . He might have made it had it not been for one of the crowd which appeared as miraculously as though a throng had been waiting amidst the trees to pop out at the instant of the crash . What had been a deserted side street immediately became a millraceof humanity as from all directions streamed chattering onlookers , avid for a glimpse of disaster . One of these diminutive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen Bracht scurry away and now there was another Westerner trying to escape the scene of this accident , and with the taxi driver so obviously dead . No , this never-to-benamedhero would not permit it ! He wrapped his arms about North 's middle and began screaming in shrill Thai to send for the police ; this foreigner was trying to leave the scene of a fatal accident as every good subject of the King knew was against the law . Cursing savagely , North fought himself free of the little man 's clutch and found himself surrounded by a close-packed crowd that pressed closer to enjoy the excitement . The G-2 colonel caught a glimpse of Bracht 's bald head bucking the tide of people who swarmed toward the wreck from ahead . Hugh tried to give chase but it was hopeless ; the throng about the smashed cab , the drunkenly tilted Citroen , simply refused to give way for him . The spectators , all Siamese , stood in a blank-faced wall that ringed the two wrecks , and before North had managed to shove his big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long gone.  |p53Hugh  turned back to the cab . Perhaps the car could be made to run and he could chase Bracht down . One look at the decrepit veteran and its dead driver stoppered that hope , and the black car was in not much better shape , its front stoved in , water and oil leaking in a widening pool on the glass-littered pavement . Well , then , perhaps Bracht had actually done the smart thing by getting out of there . If he could make the hotel and that telephonecall he was so anxious about , he would be safer than in the midst of this mob . Nobody had been chasing Bracht when North had glimpsed him . If this had been a deliberate ramming ( and Hugh had little doubt that it was ) those who had staged it might have been caught in the same human whirlpool that held North and from which Bracht had escaped before it was fully formed . The doctor should be able to get a cab or a tram ( unless he had flipped entirely ) and make his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hope Hugh tried to cling to . And now for the driver of the Citroen ; had he gotten away or did he need dealing with ? He needed dealing with . He came at North , a large , loudmouthedman in dirty Western clothes , a Manchu Chinese by the cast of his features and a strange one to be driving such a big car unless he was a chauffeur for some owner who did not mind a sloppy uniform  --  or , more probably , a hired assassin who had been furnished transportation . He advanced on Hugh , chattering high-pitched imprecations in Chinese . Close to the colonel he stopped and pointed a longnailed , very dirty finger at North . He used the Cantonese dialect , which Hugh could understand . " First he murders the poor taxicab driver , this foreign devil , and now he threatens me with his gun , " he bawled . " Which will blow a hole in your guts unless you tell me who hired you , " North rapped back in Cantonese . " Quick , my gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes sliding away too obviously . Hugh half turned to meet the threat from the rear that the big man 's eyes had warned him of.  |p54It  was the little interferer , the self-appointed guardian of the law again . The undersized Siamese grabbed North 's gun hand with both of his and recklessly tussled for possession of the .38 . The G-2 agent knew a dozen tricks that would have sent this little fellow flying twenty feet , a crippled wreck , but he could not bring himself to use any one of them . This busybody was only a misguidedbystander , after all ; despite his disastrous interference he did not deserve the treatment an out-and-out enemy would have gotten . Hugh tore himself free from the Thai 's clutch with relative ease , but in so doing and in trying not to hurt the gadfly , he lost effective use of his pistol . He still had the gun when he broke loose , but the hold-breaking maneuver required him to twist the .38 so that he was holding the weapon by its barrel as he turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant leaped , a knife glimmering in his right fist . The G-2 colonel acted by instinct ; there was no time to think . He dropped the gun ( he needed both hands now ) and twisted sideways , lurched in toward the oncoming knife wielder , under the upflung arm that brought down the blade . Even as he reached for his hold , braced himself for the throw , Hugh 's brain automaticallyregistered the thought that the Chinese never learned ; they always made a flourishing downward sweep with a knife , never the short , ugly , almost undefensible upward stab at the lower belly and groin . His hands found their place . The colonel turned a fraction of an inch farther so that when he dropped one knee to the pavementthe Manchu was crouched awkwardly over his back , the knife hand hauled rigidly forward by Hugh 's double grip . The Intelligence officer 's shoulders seemed merely to twitch  --  but the cutthroat went pinwheeling through the air , screaming with the pain of a broken arm . The big man 's parabola scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onlookers disappeared as if by magic . Hardly had the knife clanged down on the pavement , the would-be assassin smashed to the roadway with a sickening thud , when Northp55found himself the only man on his feet within a considerable radius . The G-2 colonel stooped and recovered his gun , trained it on the motionless cutthroat , but it was an unnecessary move . The Manchu 's fall had knocked him out and now he lay sprawled beside his Citroen , totally unavailable for questioning . Hugh knelt beside the unconscious man , ran through his pockets swiftly . There was a sizable wad of Thai bank notes in the would-be assassin 's pants  --  his pay for the job , no doubt  --  but nothing else of value , materially or informationwise . North straightened , chewing his underlip . Much as he wanted to give this big hulk a going-over , grind out of the man the name of his boss ( and he had ways and means of making the most uncommunicativetalk , if given time ) , he had to get out of here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of involvementfaded , and with them would doubtless come the police ; there would be a thousand explanations to make under timewastingcircumstances , possibly a journey to headquarters to find somebody who understood English , and Hugh North just did not have the time . He had to locate Hans Bracht as soon as possible or , failing that , get in touch with General Genung . Getting away from this place without attaching to his wake a column of jibbering , murder-crying Siamese was not going to be simple . Already heads were beginning to peer around the trunks of trees in the park behind him and the bolder of the scattered mob were beginning to inch toward him , ready to set up their holler again . Hugh had no idea of how to get to the Imperial from this street ; to hail a cab while a Greek chorus of denunciatorySiamese howled their imprecations was an impossibility . Better make a run for it now and try to shake this bunch somehow . He turned to sprint in the general direction the taxi had been taking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came the mellow bleat of a horn that could be part of nothing but the most expensive car . Glancing over his shoulder , North saw a gleaming Rolls limousine curve around the Citroen and head for him , its tires heedlessly crushing the glass shards strewn on the pavement . As the big car approached , Hugh could make out ap56head and arm protruding from the rear window , the hand beckoningurgently . The G-2 colonel had his pistol in his hand again as he paused to let the limousine come alongside . " Quick , " Chu Hoong hissed from the depths of the Rolls . " Get in , please . These people can be nasty when they get aroused . " A door was flung open and North hesitated only a second before he accepted the pressing invitation . He knew that Chu was involved somehow in Bracht 's past , he was suspicious of the Chinese millionaire 's place in the picture , but he could not afford to be too finicky at this moment . There were only Chu Hoong and the chauffeur to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if it was Chu 's intention to liquidate him , why had n't he gunned him down from the car ? It was a risk , certainly , but the alternative was even less inviting . North sank onto the deep cushions beside the round little millionaire and said : " Thanks . There was an accident and that crowd " I know how these people behave , Mr. Boyden , " Chu nodded quietly . " They are good people , but excitable . And they are not especially fond of foreigners or even we Chinese , who have built their country for them . It was fortunate that my driver took this way to the Imperial . " He beamed on North , his almond eyes closed to slits as he grinned . " You can thank your beautiful countrywoman , Miss Naline , for this , " he went on . " We would have used another , more traveled , street if it had not been for her motorcade . I had no idea that her artistry had gained her such world-wide fame  --  the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elephants onto detours , so that Miss Lita Naline might stream into the city unhindered , preceded by motorcycles , various city and national dignitaries , and , one presumes , a brass band . I suppose that 's why your taxi driver took such an ill-lighted route to the hotel , resulting in the unfortunate accident , eh ? " " I suppose so , " North said tersely . " You 're going to the Imperial , you say ? "  | " Yes . " Chu nodded . " I maintain a suite at the Imperial . " He glanced at North , the suggestion of a twinkle in his slanted eyes . " As a matter of fact , " he added , " I own it . " Oof ! This was going to be just dandy , keeping watch over Hans Bracht , the temperamental , non-co-operative missile genius who did n't want any watch kept over him , in a many-exit hotel owned and thus controlled down to the lowliest kitchen slavey by a man who was known and feared by this same Hans Bracht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chu Hoong said softly , " that the Imperial is the best hotel in Bangkok . I am not boasting when I say this ; the staff maintains its excellence . I 'm sure you will enjoy your stay there , Mr. Boyden . " I 'll move Bracht to another hotel , North vowed silently , and instantly contradicted himself . No good ; the people who have Tao Muong have told Bracht to stay at the Imperial and I 'm committed to keep hands of ) the kidnap deal . " I 'm sure I shall , " he replied evenly . His hand brought out a pack of cigarettes and he shook one out toward the Chinese . Chu Hoong hesitated and then accepted the cigarette , eyed it dubiously . " I 'm afraid I 'm not too well acquainted with these American filters , " he murmured . " Is there any special procedure involved in smoking this ? " North repressed his anxiety over Hans Bracht enough to summona chuckle . " No , " he replied . " Just treat it as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chu Hoong laughed appreciatively and bent forward to the flame of North 's lighter . His first puff brought a fleeting frown of disappointment to his round , goateed face , but his expression smoothed immediately . " Delicious , " he said politely . " They take some getting used to , " North admitted . The Rolls stopped for a traffic signal ( one completely ignored by a large bull elephant that swaggered cater-cornered across the intersection , nearly crushing a tiny Renault in the process ) and from somewhere came the whine of a siren , quavering above the noise of the bustling city . " That will be your Miss Naline , " Chu Hoong observed . And after a pause : " Or possibly the police rushing to the scene ofp58your recent lamentable accident . I forgot to inquire  --  was anybodyinjured ? " As if you did n't see that cab driver and the Manchu when youdrove past . " I 'm afraid the taxi driver was hurt pretty badly . The other driver seemed to be slightly banged up too . " " Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so what can they expect ? " Chu sighed . " I stay off the streets as much as possiblewhen I 'm in Bangkok , Mr. Boyden . I 'd advise you to do the same , if I do n't appear to be officious in saying that . A man can very easily be hurt or even killed in Bangkok by reckless motorists  --  and other things . " " Such as ? " The Chinese multimillionaire shrugged . " Oh , there are many hazards here for the person who is not very careful . Footpads , misguided patriots who still consider all white men as exploiters of Southeast Asia  --  there are many , many dangers to the unwary man . " He turned a bland face toward Hugh . " If I do not presume , what brings you to Bangkok , Mr. Boyden ? " he asked . " I am rude enough to ask because I have a certain influence in this city and it may be that I can be of assistance to you . Sometimes , unless he has entree to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to do business in Thailand . " " I know , " North returned . " I 've been here before , Mr. Chu . " " Oh ? Then perhaps my warnings were presumptuous . No doubt you know this country better than this miserably vain per-son . " " I doubt that , " North said . " From what I 've heard and read about you , this whole section of Southeast Asia is very well known , indeed , to you and your organization , Mr. Chu . " " What you read and heard must have been gross flattery , " the Chinese demurred . " Actually , I am only a modestly successful businessman trying to spend my few remaining years acquiring a modicum of peace of mind . " North repressed a snort . This little fat man who glibly recited his denial of importance was a person who , the G-2 colonel knew , could have spoken with the authority of firsthand knowl/edge of many things about which the U. S. State Department , the South East Asia Treaty Organization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police of half a dozen countries would like very much to be informed . Chu Hoong was more than a millionaire who had amassed a great fortune by selling a potion eagerly lapped up in every part of the Orient . Regardless of how he effaced himself , men with North 's knowledge of the Far East knew that Chu had his fingers in a whole bakery of pies , shipping , textiles , tea , rubber , rice , tin , and-although there never had been the slightest shred of proof nailed to the little fat man  --  opium . As far as the G-2 colonel had ever heard , Chu Hoong had never become involved in politics on any large scale . His system seemed to be to support with liberal donations about every political party that dunned him , operating on the theory that no matter who won the ever-mounting struggle for power , Chu Hoong would be in solid . For that reason , Hugh could not quite sell himself on the idea that Chu could be a Red agent involved in the case of Dr. Hans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chu had faced Bracht , violent on both sides , and the multimillionaire thereby had joined the list of people to be watched . But a Red agent ? It was almost inconceivable that Chu would so far desert his many sharply angled principles as to act as either agent or tool of the Reds . He did n't need to for money reasons ; his political philosophy  --  orcynicism  --  forbade it . Still , the arm of the MVD was long and its hand reached into strange places to come up with agents , coerced into obedience or victims of their own idealism . Under these circumstances no man , least of all Hugh North , was safe in positively writing off Chu Hoong as a possible tool of Moscow . " Mr. Boyden , " the Chinese was saying smoothly , " I am going to do the unforgivable and ask you again why you are in Bangkok . You have every right to be outraged at this invasion of your privacy but , believe me , I have my reasons for asking . " " And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied , as smoothly . " Let 's just say it 's a business deal that hasn'tp60been completed yet . Until it is signed , sealed , and delivered I ca n't talk about it , I 'm sorry . " Chu Hoong took the rebuff without a change of expression . " I understand , " he murmured . " Then may I ask you this : has this business deal anything to do with a certain teak lumber cartel I may have heard rumors of ? " " God damn it ! " North exploded furiously , and then caught himself . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Chu , but the office  --  I mean  --  no , of course not . It has nothing to do with teak . Hell , I could n't tell a stick of sapwood from heartwood if my life depended on it . No sir , Mr. Chu , it has nothing to do with teak , believe me ! " He watched Chu 's eyes as he launched forth with this fierce and senseless protestation , and when he was through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good try but no score . The little devil , Chu , had n't had the slightest thought that he really was connected with any teak cartel  --  a hundred to one there was n't any such thing in the making  --  and North 's " off-guard " explosion had done nothing more than confirm in the multimillionaire 's mind the idea that Hugh North , " Mr. Boyden , " was in Thailand for reasons other than commercial . " I am relieved to hear that . " Chu smiled after a tiny pause . " You see , Mr. Boyden , I am interested in lumber , among other things . If you had been an agent for  --  shall we say the opposition ?  --  you would necessarily have to be considered my enemy and I would not like that . No , I am basically a friendly person , Mr. Boyden , and it 's always unpleasant to me when a situation requiresmy action against another man . It has happened quite often , I 'm sorry to say , and I 've always felt sad at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies . I am so happy that you are not a member of the  --  ah  --  opposition . " " I 'm glad too , " Hugh said simply . " Because , like you , I 've had to deal directly with certain business enemies and sometimes it 's been a pretty messy business . I 'm so glad we wo n't have to butt heads , as the saying goes . " " A very expressive way of putting it , " Chu Hoong beamed . " And here we are at the Imperial . May your stay with us bep61happy , Mr. Boyden , and feel free to call on me for anything you wish . Anything . " Including a knife in the back ? Hugh asked , but silently , while he smiled his thanks . Inside the luxurious lobby ( Chu Hoong having had himself driven around to a private entrance after dropping the G-2 colonel ) North looked about for signs of his missing ward , Dr. Hans Bracht . He caught no glimpse of Bracht , but Lita Naline had arrived ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen her at Don Muang Airport she had been complaining loudly and she still was . Trying to soothe her and keep her voice from shattering glass were a covey of hotel minions , some underlings from the Tiger , Tiger ! company , and her lover-director , Anton Carss . " I do n't care what time it is , " the lovely Lita was declaiming , " I want a masseur and a hairdresser right now , before I even go up and look at the lousy suite . I know I 'm a fright . All those hours cooped up in that stinking plane and then that Cook 's Tour of Bangkok in the middle of the night  --  what jerk thought that up ? " " A fright ? " Anton Carss asked , aghast . " Why , you never were lovelier , dear Lita . " " Ha , I 'll bet ! And if it was that Italian , what's-her-name , you 'd probably have a masseur and a hairdresser and God knows what waiting for her . " " Perhaps . " Carss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said perhaps we would have those things for her because for her there would be a need . For you , no , darling . " Lita melted . " Oh , Anton , " she sighed , " you say such nice things . No wonder I love you more than anybody . " " And now , " offered the manager of the Imperial , a large , overdressedGreek , presently completely wilted , " will the lady be gracious enough to look over her suite to make sure it is as she wants it ? " Except , " he added hastily , " for the masseur and the hair/dresser , who will be here first thing in the morning , I personally promise you . " Lita Naline , her famous slow smile recovered , reached out to touch the manager 's cheek with a light pat . " You 're a doll , " she told him . Despite his concern for Dr. Bracht , Hugh automatically registeredthe black shadow that flitted across Anton Carss 's face . A damned jealous man , there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningless kittenish tap like that . The G-2 colonel was passing the little curio shop that apparentlyhad stayed open late to lure the moneyed arrivals when Lita hailed him from across the lobby . " Hoo-hoo , " she squealed . " Mr. Boylan or whatever it is . Hey , you in the gray suit ! " Hugh bit back what he wanted to say and turned , his Boyden smile in place . Lita descended upon him , trailed by Tiger , Tiger ! sycophants , Carss at her side . " We found your boy friend , " Lita said with a dazzling smile . " Boy friend ? " the colonel asked . " Oh , the old man on the plane , the one you protected from that perfectly foul person in the wrinkled white suit . He said he was with you in a cab and you had an accident . " North repressed his sigh of relief . " Oh , Mr. Barrows , " was the best he could offer at the moment . " My God , what happened ? " Lita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy wandering around in a perfect daze , did n't we , Anton ? Mumbled something about kidnapers and dope fiends beingafter him and all that sort of jazz , did n't he , Anton ? " " Dope fiends ? " The question was jerked out of the G-2 colonel by his surprise . What in the name of heaven had Hans Bracht told this loose-mouthed woman in the shock of his experience ? " That 's what he said . " Lita nodded vociferously . " He said the two of you It was Anton Carss who came to North 's rescue to preventp63Lita Naline from broadcasting Bracht 's words in a voice that surely must have carried to Klong Toi , twelve miles down the Menam Chao Phya . " Now , Lita , " he said gently , but with a hint of iron beneath the velvety voice , " we must n't let the whole world know about the accident and perhaps involve that nice old gentleman , with the police . A little less volume , please , darling . " Lita lowered her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosom twin-branded his chest . " It 's a fact , " she breathed . " It was positively weird . I thought I saw the guy leave the airport with you , you see , and then I happened to look over  --  I was sitting on the back of this open car , you understand  --  and there he was , sort of stumbling along the sidewalk and  --  and " She ran out of breath and inhaled , swelling the magnificencethat outjutted all her sisters ' claims to dramatic talent . " We were just in time , too , were n't we , Anton ? " " Lita darling , do n't you think " Just as we drove past and I recognized him  --  we had a police escort , of course  --  this mugger came up behind him . I screamed and the cops with us Well , there was a lot of excitement andAnton grabbed Mr. Barrows and hauled him into our car andwell , I guess he was all shook up , but anyway he said " Lita , " Carss rumbled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not excite yourself . You have that official reception early tomorrow and you know you 're never at your best if you do n't get your sleep . " " Omigawd , " the self-styled maharajah 's daughter cried . " A big do like that and I 'll look like a hag ! Come on , Anton ; what 're we hanging around here for ? " She was gone , Carss trotting after her . Hugh North mentally drew a shaking hand across his brow . Thank his lucky stars for favors received . If Lita Naline 's cavalcade had not passed a certain street corner at exactly the right minute , Dr. Hans Bracht doubtlesswould be in the hands of the Reds right now . Instead , by the way Lita spoke , he was safe in this hotel  --  if he had n't taken it into his logarithm-packed head to take off for parts unknown again.  |p64He  headed for the desk where the Greek manager of the Imperial stood , breathing heavily and mopping his forehead with a large silk handkerchief , exhausted by his set-to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquire about a Mr. Barrows , " Hugh began . " Is heThe manager 's face assumed a piteous expression . " Please , kind gentleman , " he begged . " Let us not have any more unpleasantnessover the mistake that was made . I am deeply ashamed at the stupidity of my clerk , but such things will happen . They do happen to me , I assure you . Mr. Barrows gave me to understand that he was completely satisfied and now you Oh , Iimplore you not to add to my troubles now . " " Wait a minute , " Hugh said . " Just what happened ? " " The desk clerk should have known that merely because Mr. Barrows arrived at the hotel in Miss Naline 's company did not mean that he was Mr. Wallen . No , that fool , that brainless sonofabitch , should have known that an elderly gentleman such as Mr. Barrows could not be the motion-picture star , Mr. Wallen . You would have known it , sir , and so would I , but that goat , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his eyes and that is why he put Mr. Barrows in Mr. Wallen 's suite . I assure you , sir , there was no intent to embarrass Mr. Wallen or Mr. Barrows , even though Mr. Wallen seemed to consider the whole affair as a personal affront . And now you , I suppose , wish to add to Mr. Wallen 's complaint and " Not at all , " Hugh broke in to stop the manager 's impending tears . " I only wanted to check on what room Mr. Barrows is in now . " " Room 439 , sir , the room he had reserved , " the manager said , seeing a reason to live again . " As I said , he assured me he was quite comfortable in Room 439 . It is a nice room ; no suite like Mr. Wallen 's but a very comfortable room . All the rooms at the Imperial are comfortable , all very modern . You will see . " He remembered his obligations as an innkeeper and gave North a beautiful bow . " Welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be very pleasant . Guided tours of the city may be arrangedp65at the travel bureau in the lobby , opening at nine o'clock sharp tomorrow morning . Good evening , sir . " Then , as though fearing that to linger further would invite some new catastrophe , the manager headed for his office , stepped inside , and closed the door after him . Hugh North could hear a bolt being forcibly shoved home . The G-2 colonel went to the bank of house phones and asked for Room 439 . There was the click-click of the connection and more clicks as the operator pressed the key that rang Bracht 's phone . Alarm was rising within North again when the receiver at the other end was finally lifted . " What is it ? " Hans Bracht asked harshly . " This is Boyden , " North said . " I just wanted to make sure " Stay away from me ! " the missile genius shouted . " You 're goingto ruin everything by your meddling . " " Mr. Barrows , " Hugh began , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you once against my better judgment and you know what happened . They nearly killed me for disobeying orders . No , I 'm not going to have anything more to do with you , Boyden or North or whatever your name is . I 'm going to play it my way ! " The phone was slammed down with a crash that made Hugh 's head ring . The colonel hung up slowly , wincing at the prospects . To be honest , he could hardly blame the missile genius in Room 439 for being less than enthusiastic about his services so far , but that did not alter the fact that re-enlisting Bracht 's co-operation was going to be a tough assignment . Fear that Marchet 's appearance , and possibly Chu Hoong 's , might mess up the ransom negotiations for Tao Muong 's release had forced Bracht into a reluctant agreement to work with North ; now the same fear had driven Bracht right back to the un-co-operative side of the fence again . The colonel sighed . How winsome could a hard-bitten G-2 agent get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold it ! North told himself to remember that this man was half crazy from worry for his missing wife ; he could be excused a lot of wrong thinking.  |p66North  went to the desk and registered , got his key . Yes , he had the room adjacent to Bracht 's , 437 . His bags had arrived from the airport and would be sent up immediately . The clerk who gave these assurances bore the look of a man just released from the rack ; apparently the Greek manager had chided him more than mildly for the Wallen-Barrows mix-up . Now for something to eat , North told himself . Bracht was reasonablysafe , shut up in his room , still unstrung from the cab crash and hardly likely to go sightseeing . Or was he ? In any case , a man had to eat , and the airline sandwich had been too long ago . He found one of the hotel 's many dining rooms still open , serving a scattering of late airline arrivals plus some Orientals who may have been SEATO officials . North chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway and ordered up an omelet as a safe test of the Imperial 's kitchen . He was waiting for his supper , sipping a delicious cup of tea , when the slender , beautifully tailored figure of Lita Naline 's colleague , Lex Ross , entered the dining room , looked about him as though searching for someone , spotted North , and beelined across the room to the G-2 colonel 's table . " Mind if I join you ? " he asked . There was plenty of charm in the actor 's voice but something more than that , a kind of urgency that forestalled Hugh 's intended brush-off . " Glad to have you , " North said pleasantly . " It 's Mr. Ross , is n't it ? " " That 's right , Lex Ross , and your name 's Boyden . " The graytempledactor smiled . " And I trust you have our famous friend safely tucked in bed ? " A chill struck the pit of Hugh North 's stomach and slowly widened . His face did not change , nor his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spoken with the actor 's professional timbre . " Famous friend ? " the Intelligence agent asked , half-mooning his eyebrows . " Come again ? " Ross hunched his shoulders , slipped into the chair oppositep67North , leaned over , and spoke in a voice barely above a murmur . " Afraid I 'm sticking my nose in , " he said . " You see , I knew that was Hans Bracht the minute he stepped aboard the plane in Hong Kong . " Oh , fine ! First Marchet and now this movie actor , Lex Ross , of all people . Not to speak of Chu Hoong if the Dragon 's Tooth Elixir maker actually did know Bracht . Shout it in the streets ; put it on the front page ! This was just dandy . North 's long training forbade him to inject even a note of wariness in his voice when he spoke . " Hans Bracht ? " he asked . " I 'm still out in left field , Mr. Ross . " The actor made an impatient gesture with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " You 're quite safe in having me know the man . I 'd never tell He shut off his words as Hugh 's waiter approached the table with the omelet . Ross ordered a pot of tea and some cakes and , as the mess-jacketed waiter retired , gave Hugh an on-camera smile . " As I was saying , the secret 's perfectly safe with me , Boyden . But I do know it 's Hans Bracht . Had the pleasure of attending one of the three public lectures he made before he retired into the great silence , and he 's got a face that 's not easy to forget , especially for somebody in my business . " He paused , but the G-2 colonel was busy with the omelet he suddenly did not want . " You see , " Ross went on after a wait , " I make a specialty of disguise . I 've become a bit too long in the tooth to play dashing young leading men , and since I enjoy my work and want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialized in something that does n't require a Rock Hudson face . I 'm a menace with emphasis on the art of make-up disguise . " As North stirred restlessly the other man held up a hand . " I 'm telling you this so you 'll understand how I recognized Bracht on sight , even without his beard . To the master of make-up , as to thep68art student , bone structure means everything , and even a full beard such as Bracht wore could n't hide the nose , the eyes , the cranial structure , and But I did n't mean to get technical . " " Very interesting , I 'm sure , " Hugh murmured , " but why tell me all this ? " " Because , " said Lex Ross coolly , " you 're quite obviously the man assigned to protect Dr. Bracht while he 's traveling . It figures . Here we have the world 's greatest space-travel authority going halfway around the world , not only incognito but in disguise , if you can call it that . Would Washington let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frenchman approached him you were right there  --  oh , very smoothly and professionally  --  to keep your man out of harm 's way . " Hugh North laid down his fork deliberately , touched his napkin to his lips . " Mr. Ross , " he said , " I do n't know what you 're aiming at but I remember reading something in the Victoria paper in Hong Kong that said Hans Bracht was at Cape Canaveral , putting the finishing touches on some kind of missile deal , a Mars shoot or something like that . Now how could the man be in Florida , back in the States , and still be riding the Bangkok plane , will you tell me ? " " Oh , that . " Ross shrugged . " They could put that out easily enough to protect Bracht 's incognito . " North laughed , sipped his tea , and pushed back his chair . " Excuseme , Ross , " he said , his voice half nettled , half amused , " but I 've had a long day and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business deal , I hope . I 'd like to spend more time listening to your story about incognitos and bone structure and stuff but I 'm afraid He stopped , his eyes fixed on the doorway . The Bangkok police or the Imperial Troop , whichever was represented here , were not the Keystone Kops he had thought they might be . For heading toward him was a small , scowling Thai officer with a large businesslikegun at his hip . There was not a doubt in the world that he was there to put the hand on Colonel Hugh North . The G-2 agent waited while the small man drew up in front ofp69him , raised himself to the top of his five-feet-one height , and asked in a piping voice : " Misser Chahss Boyden ? " North nodded . " That 's me . " " Cappain Pilanung Pokh , Bangkok Imperial Troop . You underarrest , puss . " Lex Ross spoke up before North could reply . " Arrest ? Why , officer , this man 's Pokh whirled on the handsome actor seated at the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You keep still like good gentleman or maybe I arrest you too on same charge . " " Which is ? " Hugh North asked . The Thai 's brown eyes came back to bore up into the colonel 's . " Murder , " said Captain Pilanung Pokh of the Bangkok ImperialTroop . Hugh heard Ross 's gasp , sensed the consternation of the nearestdiners who had overheard Pokh 's blunt word , and at the same time the G-2 agent 's brain clicked into high gear . Murder , and even the Thai police would know better than to think the cab driver had been killed in anything but the smashup . That probablymeant that whoever had sicked the cops on him , the ones who had arranged the whole auto-smash ambush , had disposed of that Manchu knife wielder sometime after North had been picked up by Chu . Somehow , somebody in the crowd that had hired the Chinese cutthroat had added to that broken arm North had given him and had notified the police that an American named Boyden , staying at the Imperial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast , these boys , and they played for keeps . But why pin a murder frame on him ; what was their objective ? Simple ; they wanted him out of the way , thrown into the Bangkok clink , so they would have a clear way to Dr. Hans Bracht . Hugh wordlessly started for the dining-room door , Pokh trottingat his side . " Do not try getaway , " the little Siamese twittered . " I best shot in whole country . " The captain uttered these words just as North was passing the table occupied by the bulky Russian textile commissar , Boris Salenkov . And did the Red fail to hide a smirking smile as hep70looked up at the colonel from behind his steel-framed glasses ; was the light in his eyes triumphant ? North kept on , not slowing his pace until both men were outside the gawking dining room and down a corridor to the door of one of the small , seldom-used parlors affected by all such big hotels . Unbidden , Hugh turned into this dimly lit room and turned to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thai warned . " We go to headquarters quick-like . " " Listen , Captain , " Hugh said tersely , " I 've got to get in touch with General Genung right away . Where do I telephone him ? " Pokh stared up in amazement . " You crazy man ? " he asked . " You want to call General Genung in middle of the night ? He chop you up in little pieces . Most angry fellow when annoyed after office hours , General Genung . " " I 'll take my chances on that , " North grunted . " I do n't think he 'll be annoyed when I tell him what I have to say . This murder charge is a frame , Captain , a  --  a " He searched for a simplerword to give Pokh . " Oh , I know what frame is , " the diminutive officer chirped . " Know all American police words . But this no frame . Have word of most honorable witness that you killed poor Chinese auto driver because you mad he hit your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I only broke his arm when he came at me with a knife , " North protested . " He was knocked out when Neer  --  whenhe fell . There were a hundred people  --  " He checked himself . Which one of that crowd would step forward to support his story , even if one of that mob actually did not believe he had killed the Manchu with that judo toss ? They were wasting time arguing the point ; he had to get to Bracht . He walked to the door of the parlor , looked up and down the corridor to make sure it was empty , turned back to Pokh , who was fingering his revolver butt again . " Captain , " he said in a voice barely above a whisper , " my name is n't Charles Boyden . It 's North , Hugh North , and I 'm with the United States Army , Intelligence Division . "  |p71Little  Pokh 's face wrinkled in a disdainful grin . " Ho , this is new one , " he crowed . " I have arrested men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me thrown out of Imperial Troop . Once I got a pickpocket who said he one of royal family , but I never got Intelligence officer of the U. S. A. Army before . " He shook his head , his toupee wagging decisively . " No good , Misser Boyden . We go headquarters and " But I ca n't leave the hotel , " North said urgently . " The ones who fixed the frame want to get me away from here so they Ca n't you call General Genung ? Just mention the name Hugh North to him ; I 'm sure he 'll tell you to co-operate with me . " Pokh had had enough of this . The time had come , he obviously decided , to get tough with this big American and his silly story about calling General Genung in the middle of the night , and the general enjoying the new wife he had married only a week before . The little man resumed his official scowl and tapped the ponderous revolver at his side . " No more foolishment , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Misser Boyden . Must tell you I am whatyousay fast on draw , shoot you dead before you wink your eye if you try tricks . " " I 'm not so slow with a gun myself , " North said grimly . " See ? " And Captain Pilanung Pokh looked into the 0 of a .38-caliber revolver 's muzzle , one inch from his button nose . The Thai captain gave a squawk of outraged amazement and then , crazily , suicidally , went for his own gun . North moved with camera-shutter speed , and when Pokh recovered his balance ( he never knew whether he had been pushed or pulled or both , and why had his knees suddenly buckled ? ) his heavy pistol was in the colonel 's left hand , its muzzle making the second of a deadly pair of eyes . There was a moment 's stark silence before Hugh smiled gently . " Always remember to give a murder suspect a frisk , Captain , " he said . " Now , do we telephone General Genung ? " Pokh spluttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linguistic gears into English . " Why you no shoot  --  I mean , give me my gun . Is bad trick to take my gun away like that . "  | " Admitted . " North nodded . " But I had to show you I 'm no murderer . If I were I 'd put a round through that second tunic button or at least let you have a gun barrel over the head , would n't I ? Instead , I 'm asking you to call General Genung . " Captain Pokh considered . It was a bad moment for Hugh . If this little man 's " face " had been too badly shaken he could prove a mortal enemy , an obstacle to all Hugh would have to do while in Bangkok . The captain had fancied himself as an oriental Wyatt Earp , and to have had his gun taken from him as easily as a lollipop lifted from a mewling infant must have been a crushing blow to his ego . Now the question was whether Pokh would be so insulted that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him positively balk at calling Genung , what would be North 's next move ? Then Hugh relaxed . A beautiful grin overspread Pokh 's face and North knew that here was a walking miracle , a Far Eastern official with a Western sense of humor , able to laugh at himself . " Okay , " the little captain said wryly . " You win . But I make whatyousay proposition . You do n't tell General Genung about takingmy gun and I 'll call him , get him right out of new number-five wife 's arms . Is deal ? " " Is deal , " said North promptly . He debated his next step quickly , decided it was a risk worth taking , seeing that he wanted to make a good friend of all Bangkok police authorities , starting with Captain Pokh . He reversed the heavy , badly balanced revolver he had taken from the Thai and offered Pokh the butt of his gun . " Here you are , " he said . " I never had it . " Pokh beamed , bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , and slid the great weapon into its holster . " We go call General Genung from lobby , hey ? " North rubbed a thumb along his jaw . " Just how safe is the hotel switchboard ? " he asked . The captain shrugged . " Sorry to say all telephones in Thailand not good for secrets . Is pretty new here . Everybody like to listen , tell everybody else what he hear . General Genung speak English , though . " He looked about to make sure his general had not strolledp73into the parlor . " Not good like me , but he pretty good . Eavesfaller do n't understand you if you speak English to him . " But Chu Hoong would . Or Mary Hollberg . Or quite possibly Comrade Boris Salenkov . " We 'll take a chance on calling from my room , " he decided . " Maybe I can get over to the general without saying too much . " The two men , tiny police captain and strapping G-2 agent , crossed the deserted lobby to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , and ascended to the fourth floor . If Chu Hoong had built this luxurious pile he had saved money on the elevators ; it seemed to North to take forever to gain the fourth floor . Room 437 was next to the last door on a corridor stretching to the left from the elevator bank ; Room 439 was at the end of the hall , an outside corner room . Hugh noted the fact and frowned . People in Bracht 's position should never be given outside corner rooms ; it made it too easy for the Opposition . Unwelcome strangers could be lowered from the room above from two directions and then , too , an outside corner room with its windows gave long-distance snipers two angles from which to peer through telescopic sights . He unlocked his door , entered , snapping on the overhead lights , and crossed directly to the connecting door to 439 . He checked it , found it locked , and rattled his knuckles against the panel . The response was immediate . " Who is it ? " Hans Bracht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good ; Bracht was a light sleeper . Or had he been lying there , fighting to stay awake , waiting for that phone call from the kidnapersthat he had mentioned on the way in from Don Muang ? " It 's Boyden , " North said into the crack between door and frame . " Just checking to make sure you 're all right . " There was a snort from the scientist . " Leave me alone , " Bracht growled . " Let a man sleep . " " Did you get your call ? " " No , I Leave me alone , ca n't you ? " Hugh could hear the faint pad of Bracht 's bare feet leaving the connecting door and then there came the creak of springs , the rustle of bedclothes . The Intelligence officer turned back from the door , reassured.  |p74They  had not made their follow-up move after the framed arrest ; it was possible that They knew he had stayed out of jail and had canceled their plans or postponed them . Captain Pokh was politely engaged in studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears almost but not quite vibrating visibly . Hugh walked to the cowhide portmanteau that had been set on the luggage rack , opened the case , and drew out a bottle of Duer 's White Label . " Would it be a terrible breach of regulations for you to have a small drink before we talk to General Genung ? " he asked the captain . Pokh looked horrified . " On duty ? " he asked . " Good heaven , General Genung chop me in pieces . " He studied his wrist watch and beamed beatifically . " I off duty in eighteen minutes , " he added . " You go ahead ; I join you later . " North nodded , splashed a generous dollop of scotch into a bathroomglass , and added a light dusting of tap water . He swallowed the drink in two gulps , grateful for the invigorating warmth that spread through his bone-weary body . Since he had picked up Bracht at Manila he had had about four hours ' sleep , and this mission , with all its weird peculiarities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him much leisure time for rest and relaxation . North would have been the first to agree that scotch was a poor substitute for sleep , but there were times when one was impossible and the other came in mighty handy . Then , while Pokh watched wonderingly , the G-2 colonel made a tour of the room , tilting the awful chromo and the mirror on the other wall , running his fingers on the underside of bed , bureau , and desk , unscrewing the base of the telephone with a pocketknifescrew driver and examining the wires therein , reversing all the rugs , standing on a chair to feel along the top of the window . At length he quit his search and went back to the phone , dusting his hands . " I do n't think they 've bugged me but I have n't time for a real look , " he told Captain Pokh . " I want to talk to the general . What 's his phone number ? "  |p75Five  minutes later , North hung up the telephone and heard a marveling Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Genung out of warm bed and when he begin to scream and curse you take telephone and say one-two words and lo , General Genung is like father with ugly daughter talking to nearsighted suitor . What you say to him , Colonel North ? I do n't understand those words . " " Let 's hope whoever may have been listening in did n't understand , either . " Hugh grimaced . " How about that drink now ? " Pokh looked at his wrist watch earnestly . " Has been running very slow lately , " he said finally . " Is surely time up now , thank you . " North mixed a strong drink for Pokh , a milder one for himself , handed the little captain his highball , and took his own to the bed , where he lounged while he talked . " I gave your general a couple of code identification words that my crowd sent him when this job began , " he explained to the awe-struck Thai . " I 'd hoped I would n't have to involve you boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame on me I could see trouble ahead unless I cleared myself with you . " " You out here on big mission , hey ? " Pokh murmured . He jerked his head toward the connecting door . " Is about him ? " " There are a lot of things involved , " North said vaguely . " Tell me about the tip that I murdered the Manchu  --  any idea where it came from ? " Pokh shook his head . " Came to me from headquarters on radio . Was close to hotel anyway , and radio says Misser Chahss Boyden wanted for murder of poor Chinese in Samsen district . First went to murder  --  accident scene . Everybody there say big American run away after Chinese fall down dead . Come back to hotel ; clerk say you in dining room and tell me what you look like  --  large , pretty man with brown eyes , curly hair , white teeth  --  oh , real pretty man ! "  | " Never mind that , damn it , " North growled . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from headquarters , so it could n't have taken you long to do all this . That means whoever phoned headquarters must have put in the call right after the fight . " " Did not take long , " Pokh agreed . " I was leaving hotel after escorting Miss Movie Star Lita Naline , beautiful woman , from airport to hotel . Was fine parade . Blew siren like hell alla way . Oh , very fine , noisy procession . " North sat bolt upright . " You were in that parade ? Then you must have seen the commotion when Miss Naline 's car stopped and she took a man into her car  --  a man who 'd been walking along the street . " Pokh nodded placidly . " Oh yes . Man name of Barrows . Americanlike you . Got lost in Bangkok and was very fortunate we come by . Badman in crowd was going to "  --  he searched among his " American police words " and found what he was after  --  " goingto mug him , by goodness . Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to take a mighty swig of his highballand then regarded North pridefully . " But he not get away , " he announced . " Is caught by Sergeant Lagynan two-three blocks from scene of attempted crime . " North bounced to his feet , his glass slopping . " What ? You mean you got the guy ? " Another placid nod . " Of course . Nobody get away from ImperialTroop . You know about Bangkok Imperial Troop , Colonel ? Is private army suppose to only guard King but is real police force in Bangkok , better than stupid city policemen , so got authorityanywhere in country if we want it . Was organized in " Yes , yes , " North broke in . " What about this man you caught ? " " Oh , is miserable Macanese who calls himself Aloysius Robinson , real name unknown but something low , have no doubt . " " Macanese  --  you mean this Robinson is from Macao ? A traveler ? What do you know about him ? " Pokh 's button nose wrinkled in disgust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just whatyousay hoodlum that goes from one place to another , anywhere he can make mischief . He should be kept outp77of Thailand , but strange shh-shh influences let him in and protecthim , too . Lock him up for anything , bothering little girls , picking pockets , getting drunk and beating people , and strange shh-shh influences get him out of jail quick-like . Is so that we do n't bother to arrest him any more . Give him kick in "  --  he used a Thai word  --  " and tell him begone . " " But this time you must have locked him up . " Pokh nodded . " Oh yes , " he said unenthusiastically , " but is dollahs to "  --  he searched again and came up with a near miss  --  " dollnuts he is out by now . Make five thousand bahts bail pssst , like that , and goes out again , scotch-free . " He looked at his empty glass as he said the word " scotch . " " Can you find out if he 's in or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " Oh sure . " Pokh smiled . " This time no water , puss . " He spoke over the phone in Siamese while the colonel poured a staggering jolt , and when he hung up the captain shrugged his narrow shoulders . " Is like I said , " he told North . " Bail at headquarters almost before Sergeant Lagynan get him there . " " Who is this Robinson ? What do you know about him ? " Another grimace . " Is young whatyousay hood , twenty-one-two years old . Nobody knows what he does except make trouble . Alwaysplenty money . Clothes full of loud colors . Was in U.S.A. plenty times , last time two-three months ago . Talks American dialect , bop . You know bop , Colonel ? " " Not enough to want to learn more , " North grunted . " Has this Robinson ever been hooked up with the Communists , Captain ? " Pokh gave a brief laugh . " Aloysius Robinson ? Even Communiststell him begone if he try to join them . This man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to Whassa mattah ? " Colonel North had slapped a forefinger to his lips in the midst of Pokh 's recitation . He had been intent on what the little captain had been telling him , but his long years of experience in this work had developed some part of his hearing mechanism to send out constant radar waves , if they could be called that , to pick up any sounds that needed explaining.  |p78And  there had been something , a click of metal against metal , a furtive scraping of a key in a lock or a latch being slipped , that did need explaining . Hugh moved silently to the door of his room , the snub-snouted .38 out and ready . Pokh started to speak , stopped at North 's headshake , and then , seeing the colonel 's gun , unholsteredhis own big pistol . The scraping noise had stopped . North put his ear to the door , heard nothing for the space of about thirty seconds , and then the stealthy scratching clink began again . Whoever was at work was operating on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugh could tell from the sounds that he was no expert keyman . Himself an adept at picking locks when necessary , North knew that the types of locks installed in the Imperial 's doors would take even a fair keyman only a few seconds to open , the night latches not much longer , and yet this prowler was making a First National Bank job out of it . Noiselessly the G-2 agent slipped open the night latch of his own door . He hefted his gun , seized the knob , and flung open the door , moving into the hall with a fluid motion that put him next to the crouched prowler in a single step , his .38 boring into the man 's neck . " Hold it , " he hissed . The figure under his gun stiffened , dropped the key he had been using . Colonel North grabbed the man 's right arm and twisted it up and behind the prowler 's back , jerked him upright , and whirled him around and through the door into Room 437 in a single motion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We just talking about no-good Aloysius Robinson and here he is ! " Aloysius Robinson of Macao proved to be a narrow-shouldered , dark-visaged young man with an effluviant crop of greasy black hair and a nasty snarl that revealed bad teeth . But it was not his face that made Hugh North stare as hep79twisted the hood away from him , still pinioned , to get a look ; it was the clothes the man wore . It was a warm , humid night in Bangkok , and yet Robinson wore a heavy flannel sports coat of horse-blanket plaid , the predominant color a bilious yellow-green ; a pair of mauve , almost purple slacks ; the only pair of pointed saddle shoes North had ever seen in his life ; a multicolored Hawaiian sports shirt , and , unbelievably , a blue-and-white-striped guards tie . On the aforementioned oily hair , Robinson had perched a ridiculous red beret , the bopster 's uniform helmet . Aloysius was drunk . His breath and every pore of his unwashedbody exuded the stink of stale whisky . " Lemme go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Got no ri ' to do this . " Keeping a firm grip on the young man 's wrist from behind , the G-2 colonel gave Robinson a quick , thorough frisk . He came up with an evil-looking switchblade knife but no gun . Hugh shoved the Macanese away , turning him so that the back of his knees caught the edge of the bed , dumping Robinson onto the coverlet . " Stay right there , " North warned . Instead , Aloysius tried to struggle to his feet . He had barely started when North 's hand prodded his shoulder and sent him back again . " Goddamn you , you lousy The colonel 's hand whiperacked across the young man 's mouth with a stinging slap . The jolt sent a shock of the greasy hair flopping down over Robinson 's eyes , and Aloysius took quite a time to brush it back , his wavering stare trying to fix itself on North . " You 'll pay plenty f'r that , " he managed finally , and drew the back of his hand across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not there . He looked back up at the colonel . " When I get through with you , Daddy-o , you 'll wish you never " Shut up ! " Hugh North crackled . " Who are you working for ? " A sneer overspread the dark features . " Whaddaya mean , man , who 'm I workin ' for ? Only squares work , did n't you know that ?  |p80Me  , I just lay back and let things transpire . Dig that , copper , that transpire bit ? " " Is most strange dialect , the bop , " Pokh murmured . " Very confusing to Thai police . " " Oh , Strong Man here digs it , do n't you ? " Robinson jeered . " Strong Man here knows everything about everything but what 's real . Reet , Strong Man ? " Hugh North clamped his jaws tightly to keep his words from spilling out . He counted himself as tolerant as the next man , but an accidental and brief acquaintance with some members of the beat generation during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but pain . If being the opposite to one of those people was to be a square , Hugh hoped all his corners were sharp . Aloysius Robinson was trying to get to his feet again . Hugh shoved the young man back on the bed and leaned over him , breathing through his mouth to escape those liquor fumes . " Listen , Robinson , " he grated , " you can turn off the bop talk long enough to answer a couple of questions . Who sent you after that man on the street tonight , that Mr. Barrows ? Who sent you up here to get into his room ? You 'd better talk , son , because I 'm going to get some answers one way or another and there 'll be nobodycoming here to bail you out of this room till I do , I promise you. , , " Big Man , " Robinson gibed . " You scare me , Pops  --  you scare me to death . " North 's hand reached down to bunch the gaudy sports jacket at the lapels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the brown , pitted face . " You 'd better scare , Robinson , because I get real mean when I 'm sore and I 'm sore now . Maybe you were there to see what I did to that guy who came at me with a knife after that taxi smashup . That was just a broken arm until you boys finished the job , but it was real neat , do n't you think ? How 'd you like one , or maybe a broken leg ? Or a flattened nose ? Because , believe me , I 'd like to show you how neat I can be . " " You  --  you would n't dare , " Aloysius faltered . " Try me . Just keep on with this bop crap or giving me anyp81other kind of lip and you 'll see . Now , who sent you up here after Barrows ? " The black eyes slid away , roamed about the room . North 's grip tightened and his left hand rose from his side , slowly , significantly . Robinson blurted his words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he protested . " I was just tryin ' to get in my own room when you jumped me , is all . " " You 've got to do better than that , " North said grimly . " I tellya that 's the truth , " Robinson squalled . " Lookit my key . It 's for next door , Room 539 . Lookit the key , wise guy , and you 'll see I 'm tellin ' the truth . " Hugh jerked his head toward the door . " The key 's on the floor just outside the door to 439 , Captain , " he said . Pokh slipped out and was back in a couple of seconds . " This is the key to 539 , Colonel , " he said regretfully . " It is as this  --  this ponk says . " " Colonel ? " Aloysius asked , his eyes widening . " What 's with this colonel jazz , huh ? If you 're a colonel why ai n't you wearin ' a doorman suit with the sword , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you " Oh , shut up , " North said coldly . The number on the key tag meant nothing at all . Any half-smart group behind a move on Hans Bracht would have figured on a possible misfire enough to have an alibi ready for their man ; a tag with a similar room numberon it could be put on a skeleton key easily enough  --  did n't Chu Hoong own this hotel and was n't he somehow linked with the Opposition ? " How about that business on the street when you tried to jump Barrows ? " he demanded . " I suppose you made an honest mistake there , too . " Robinson slumped back , resting on an elbow . " Jeez , what a blister , " he complained . " A guy tries to do a guy a favor and first the cops throw him in the can and then this colonel character makes with the fierce questions . " He sat up again . " Look , Pops , " he said , " all I know is what I told them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an old cat with the frantic look , walkin ' along like he was lost , but I meanp82real lost , in orbit . Now Bangkok ai n't a good place for an old gent with the vague look and maybe here is a chance to pick up a stray baht or six bein ' a guide to this guy from Quaintsville . So I step up to him to be a boy scout and the parade comes by and a dame in one of the cars starts giving with the shrieks and screams . So I got out of there and a cop puts the arm on me , of course , to make a fast score and maybe earn a nod from Genung . And that 's all . " " Is what he said at the station , I am inform . " Pokh nodded . North scowled down at the lurid figure on the bed . The trouble with this outlandish character 's story was that it just possibly could be true , or at least true enough to separate Aloysius Robinson from any plot against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had slipped up on Bracht with the idea of picking his pocket or possibly mugging the scientist , but even so , a bit of sidewalk banditry did not place this unpleasant young man in the main picture . As for the key alibi  --  North turned abruptly and walked to the phone . " Who is in Room 539 ? " he asked the operator after the sleepy acknowledgment of the call . There was a wait and then the sleep-laden voice said : " hisser Ah  --  aah  --  Misser A. Robinson of Macao , pliss . " Hugh hung up to meet Robinson 's triumphant smirk . " You satisfiednow , Strong Man ? " the oily-haired hood asked . North said , " No , but I 'm letting you out of here this time . And I warn you , Robinson ; from now on I 'll have my eye open for you , and if you make any more of your honest mistakes I 'm going to lean on you . Hard . Now get out . " Robinson got off the bed and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Pokh handed him his key he asked : " How about m'knife ? You got no right to keep m'knife , copper . " " I know . " The G-2 colonel smiled . " Suppose you make a complaintto the police . In court maybe I could find out how a crumb like you can afford a room at the Imperial . I could find out who pays for your liquor  --  I could find out a lot of things . " Aloysius Robinson gave a short , nasty laugh . " I can tell youp83right now , Snoop . A dame is payin ' my way . A fat old dame that likes her men young and often . Dig me ? " " Get out of here before I change my mind , " the colonel said disgustedly . " And do n't cross my way again . " Aloysius Robinson teetered out into the hall and headed toward the elevators . Hugh watched him until the lift finally arrived to take him in and then turned back into Room 437 . " What you think now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It could be coincidence but it could also be something else . I do n't know who 'd hire an article like that for any important job . " He thought of Mary Hollberg and her open pitch to him , her inexpert picturization of the concert pianist . " But , " he added , " maybe They operate differently in Thailand than anywhere else . " " Who is They ? " Captain Pokh wanted to know , and hastened to append : " But maybe is not permitted to tell , hey ? " Hugh North measured his man . He had known this little Thai police officer only a short time and yet the undersized captain had given certain signs of eventually deserving his trust , somethingthat the colonel gave or withheld by instinct more times than by objective reasoning . It was too early to take Pokh into his confidence , but Hugh had no doubt that sooner or later he would need an assistant , a fellow worker who understood the situation , and despite some of Pokh 's comic-opera qualities it might be good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when the time came . " Let 's just say for now that They are the Opposition , Captain . " Hugh smiled . " And how about another drop ? " Colonel North waited five minutes after Captain Pokh had left , promising to report back in the morning ( " General Genung tell me to do anything you say , he do n't care what " ) , before the G-2 operative went into silent action . His first move was to the attache case that rested on the floorp84near the baggage rack that bore the cowhide portmanteau . He scanned this case thoroughly , saw that the hairline thread that would have signaled tampering was in place , and unlocked it . From the assortment of odd items in the case he selected a small , compact article similar to a stethoscope but with a narrow , flat , bladelike piece in place of the stethoscope 's round ear . The blade he inserted under the connecting door to Room 439 and fitted the earpieces in place . Now Hans Bracht 's breathing sounded as though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street sounds filtering through the fourth-floor windows of the room next door were greatly magnified . The G-2 colonel listened for what would have seemed a long time to anybody who might have been watching this tableau until , satisfied at length its case . Next he took out an array of tiny tools , some hooked at the end , others curved , some resembling keys and others files , and all composed of a material as strong as steel yet with the precious quality of absorbing sound like a sponge absorbing water . No matter how sharply one of these tools was struck against metal there was no more than a tiny dull thud , inaudible a foot away . ( Proving that not all of the Army 's scientific research was directedat the development of missiles , high explosives , or submersibletanks . ) It required Hugh only a few seconds to throw the latch on Bracht 's side of the connecting door . The colonel stepped out of his cordovans with a practiced scuff and padded back to the attachecase . From this he extracted a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might have come from the dime store . His next step was to don the glasses , snap off the lights in his room , press the flashlight button . A bar of light streaked across to the farther wall , but the G-2 colonel was the only one who could have seen it ; it was " black light , " the miracle of ultra ray used by the Navy in World War II and brought to perfection in some of the nation 's most secret , most closely guarded laboratories.  |p85North  went to the connecting door , eased it open , gently , gently , and slipped inside . He stood by the door for a full twenty seconds , measuring Bracht 's fitful breathing . This was a touchy job , with the doctor such a light sleeper , so likely to be awakened by his horrid dreams born of his worry . Certain that Bracht was truly asleep for the moment , at least , North shot the lamp 's black beam at the telephone on the bedside stand . Using the strange implements such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the base of Bracht 's phone , did things with wires , including the addition of a separate strand of cobweb-thin wires which he molded to the regular cord , then led it down to the edge of the wall-to-wall carpeting . Out of sight from the phone 's user and invisible to anyone who would not be looking for it , Hugh separated the cobweb wires from the cord and used its adhesive covering to mold it to the baseboard . He led this wire to the connecting door and through , into his room . The whole operation required a little over one minute , and after Hugh had made a connection to his own telephone he was in business ; now when Bracht got that telephone call from the people who were holding Tao Muong , Army G-2 would be listeningin , in the person of Colonel Hugh North . He did not have too long to wait . It seemed that three seconds after he lay down on top of his bed , fully clothed and with the listening device under the ( carefully relocked ) connecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his sleep by the shrill of Bracht 's phone . Actually it was something just over four hours ; the colonel 's wrist watch showed the time at quarter to eight when the deafeningly amplified bell clamored its summons . Hugh raised his own phone , clicked a switch , and heard the missile scientist 's gruff hello . The voice that spoke to Hans Bracht brought a deep crease to Colonel North 's forehead . Was it man or woman , was that faint accent real or faked ? " Hans Bracht ? " North checked the fact that these people werep86sure of themselves ; they did not bother with the pseudonym the space-travel genius had used on his way out here . " Yes ! " Bracht was wide awake now and eager , hopeful . " Yes , I have been waiting for your call . " So Bracht had spoken to this same person before ; he recognized that muffled , distorted voice . " You said you 'd call last night . I waited and waited but you did n't call  --  why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it suits us , Doctor . " There was the suggestion of the Germanic Doktor in the pronunciation of the word . " All you have to do is wait for us to contact you . " That was an Americanism , " contact " used as a verb . " You are alone ? " " Yes , oh yes . I 've been alone ever since I got here . " " But not on the way here , eh ? We have reports that you violatedour instructions . " The stilted speech of the kidnaper was very noticeable ; taken at face value it was the speech of one who thought in some other language while he spoke in English , but that was a ruse easily employed and often used . " I did n't , I did n't ! " Bracht protested . " I do n't know what you 're talking about ! " " No ? " Coldly . " We have been told that you spoke to at least two persons aboard the plane from Hong Kong , that you dared strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naline . You were seen entering the hotel with her . " " That  --  that was an accident , " Bracht said wildly . " On the plane some man  --  somebody thought he recognized me . I  --  I told him he was wrong . What could I do , just sit there and refuse to speak ? " " But there was another person involved , a man named Boyden . Who is he ? " Hugh North held his breath while Bracht hesitated . Just how far would he go in protecting North 's identity , this un-co-operative genius who thought he had reason to mistrust all government operatives assigned to protect him ? He exhaled a sigh of relief as Bracht replied . " He says his name is Boyden , Charles Boyden . He interfered when this other man might have ruined everything by telling my real name . That 's all I know . "  | " And you shared a taxi with him from the airport to the hotel  --  or at least you started out with him . Why ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together  --  Barrowsand Boyden  --  and he asked me if I wanted to ride with him . You gave me no instructions about the trip from the airport to the hotel ; it would have made him curious if I 'd said no . " Good boy , North breathed . Spoken like a pro . There was a moment 's pause at the other end of the line and then the unusual voice indicated reluctant acceptance of Bracht 's story . " All right , tell us about the accident . " " I do n't know much about it , " Bracht replied . " All of a sudden this car smashed into our cab . I was thrown out and I guess I was dazed . I thought  --  I do n't know what I thought ; anyway , I knew you did n't have anything to do with it so I ran away . I wandered along the streets until some cars came past and Miss Naline hailed me . She 'd been on the Hong Kong plane with me but we had n't even spoken to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trying to attack me from behind when she saw me . I do n't know whether that 's right or if she imagined it . Anyway , there was some commotion and the police escort took after somebody , some man . " " You saw this man ? " " No . But that 's the reason I rode to the hotel with Miss Naline . The only reason  --  on my honor ! " Another pause . " Well , it has not been good , Doctor . All this attention centered on you is bad . It will require investigation to see if you are telling the truth . If you 're not  --  I suppose you can guess what will happen to your wife if you 're trying to play tricks on us , Hans Bracht . " " I 'm not ! " The scientist 's protest was a wail . " I tell you I 'm ready to do anything you say . I have the money with me . Tell me how to pay the ransom and get Tao Muong back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , suddenly more alive than it had been , as though the speaker were angered . " If you had not become involved with all these people it would be easy , but now we must have a delay . "  | " No , " Hans Bracht croaked . " No , you promised that when I " I tell you we are giving the orders here ! There will be a delay of at least three days , maybe more , before the transaction can be completed . Stay inside the hotel , close to your room , for the next several days , Doctor . " Again the hint of the word Doktor . " You will hear from us . Do not show yourself on the streets of Bangkok ; it will be dangerous for both you and your wife . " " Several days ! " Bracht cried . " But you said Oh , all right . Tao Muong , is she well ? You are n't  --  you are n't stalling because you have n't got Tao Muong with you ? Nothing 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in Bracht 's last question . " She is with us and well , " the voice replied , turned cold again . " You will be permitted to speak to her on the same terms as in Hong Kong . You will ask no questions , you will not even open your mouth while she is talking to you . We will be listening . Try to give her a message or learn where she is and we will act . I think it will be one of her lovely eyes that will be gouged out first if you try to play tricks with us , Doctor . You understand ? " " Yes , I understand . Let me hear her speak . " There was a moment 's wait and then a woman 's voice came on the wire , a high-pitched , twittery voice of ineffable sweetness , a bird-song voice that thrilled North even in this situation . " Ah , darling Hans , " the girl said , " it will not be long . Do as they say and soon we will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you , Hans , and they will not hurt me , but if you do not obey them  --  ah , my darling , it will be terrible ! Do what they tell you , Hans , and we will soon be together . Good-by , beloved . " North heard Bracht groan softly . Poor devil , Hugh was forced to tell himself , he 's really in the middle . His wife tells him to play ball with these rats or she 'll be tortured , and still out of his loyalty to his country and his mission he walks a razor 's edge , covering for me . My hat 's off to you , Hans Bracht , no matter what 1 may have thought of you before  --  and may think of you again . The voice that had opened this conversation took over . " You heard what your wife said , Doctor , " it warned Bracht . " See thatp89you follow our orders . We are not pleased by this interfer-ence " " But I tell you it was n't my fault ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " All right , we believe you until we investigate , at least . But if you are up to something , your wife will suffer . Stay within the hotel , near your telephone , for the next several days , remember . " The receiver at the kidnaper 's end of the line was lowered with a muted click . Then , after a second , Bracht 's phone was hung up . Hugh flipped the switch on the " bug " and lay back on the bed , frowning at the ceiling . So Tao Muong  --  if that had been Tao Muong  --  was in Bangkok . The kidnaper had mentioned something about the conditions of this conversation between Bracht and his wife being the same as in Hong Kong . There had been no chance to bug Bracht 's phone in Victoria , on Hong Kong Island ; passengers aboard the plane from Manila had been taken into the city from Kaitak Airporton Kowloon Peninsula and were lodged in a hotel , but just long enough to lunch and freshen up , catch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room Bracht had been assigned and had used that opportunity to talk to him , let him hear from the real or pseudo Tao Muong . Hugh reached out to the night stand and got a cigarette from the rumpled pack that lay there . This latest development was gettinginteresting . If Tao Muong had been in Hong Kong the day before , how had she gotten to Bangkok ? Had there been a later flight from Hong Kong to the Thai capital that had not been listed on the regular schedules ? It required only a brief phone call to Don Muang Airport to knock this possibility in the head . No , Flight 184 had been the last plane from Hong Kong to land at Bangkok on the previous day . Well , then , either They had flown Tao Muong over in a privateairplane or it simply had not been Tao Muong who had spoken to Hans Bracht . The Reds must have on their list of agents some woman who could mimic Tao Muong 's voice to perfection , and the stern restrictions that had kept Bracht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions , indicated that a stooge was being used . Hugh cautioned himself that if it seemed incredible that a man with Bracht 's brains could be led across the world by a phony voice over the wire , it had to be remembered that here was an elderly man hopelessly infatuated with a beautiful young wife . In his fear for Tao Muong 's safety the space-travel king must have been a soft touch for even the vaguest proofs that Tao Muong lay at the end of the trip to Bangkok . " I 've got to gain the old boy 's confidence somehow , " North murmured , half aloud . " Maybe I should have invited him in on that little party with Robinson  --  it might have impressed on him the fact that the cab crash , Robinson 's mugging attempt , the greasy wart 's trying to get into his room mean that somebody 's out to get him . " He shook his head at his own conjecture . Bracht would have been sure Robinson was what the young punk claimed to be , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which , Hugh thought wryly , the guy just might be . The colonel abandoned his thoughts , crushed out his cigarette , and began stripping off his clothes . The kidnaper 's remarks about several days ' lull in activities notwithstanding , it seemed advisablefor a hard-working G-2 agent to refresh himself with cold showers and such whenever possible ; it looked like a busy stretch ahead . Hans Bracht was under orders to stay in the hotel ; thank heavens for that , at least . He was emerging from the bathroom , his close-clipped pepperand-salthair glistening with water drops , when his phone rang . " Mr. Boyden ? " asked Mary Hollberg sweetly . " I 've been waiting to hear from you . " North glanced at his watch on the night table ; eight-thirty and Mary was certainly wasting no time . She was indeed a different-typeRed agent , if that 's what she was ; no woman operative Hugh had met in his long career had ever tried the seduction gambit before noon unless it had been a continuation of the previousnight 's activities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so late I did n't thinkp91you 'd want to be bothered , " he explained into the mouthpiece . " And I sat up until all hours , waiting , " Mary mourned . " Well " How about breakfast ? " the self-styled concert pianist suggested . North considered . He wanted to  --  had to  --  find out where this German girl fit into this setup , and it seemed unlikely that there would be a better opportunity to put Mary Hollberg through the wringer than now . Bright morning was hardly the time for whoevercould be after Bracht to make a move  --  if any time was more unlikely than another  --  and the kidnaper had just spoken to the scientist ; there was almost no possibility that they would call back within the time it would take him to eat breakfast with Mary Hollberg . " Fine , " he said heartily . " Give me a few minutes to bathe and shave and get dressed . I 'll meet you in the dining room . " " I had an idea we could have breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North could almost see her pout . " Well  --  well , I 'm supposed to meet a fella in the lobby , " Hugh explained . " I wish I could make it in your room  --  I sure do  --  but  --  well , you see how it is , Miss Hollberg . " A tiny pause and then : " Well , all right . I 'll meet you in the dining room . " North 's wide mouth quirked as he hung up the phone . Just what in hell was the blonde up to ? Had she planned knockout drops in the Rice Krispies or was she one of that small but select sorority who considered it more fun in daylight ? Or has she just now gotten her instructions from higher up , orders that had told her to get busy on the double ? He took his time dressing , waiting for some sound to tell him that Hans Bracht was up and around , but by the time he was ready to go there had been not a murmur from next door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scientist ignored the first summons . Finally Bracht 's harsh voice sounded with a " What is it ? " " Doctor , are the shades of your window drawn ? " Hugh knewp92they had not been during his nocturnal visit ; the question was merely an icebreaker . Bracht apparently studied this question from all sides , found nothing in it to which the all-seeing eye and all-hearing ear of the kidnapers could object . " No , " he said gruffly . " Then please draw them for a moment , " North said mildly . " I want to talk to you for a second and I promised I would n't do anything that the people who hold your wife might object to . " " Damn it , North , why do n't you keep out of this ? Why do n't you leave me alone ? " " Because I want to see you get Mrs. Bracht back as soon as possible , " Hugh returned . " I want to get you back safely in the States . Just draw the shades ; certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress . " A grunt and then the sounds of Hans Bracht crossing his room to pull down the blinds . Hugh took advantage of this time to removeand pack the listening device . He waited until Bracht unlockedthe latch on his side , then turned his own latch and pulled open the door . The space-missile genius was in his pajamas , his frizzy hair starting wildly about his bald dome , his face haggard despite the hours of restless sleep he might have had . Without his glasses , Bracht looked even older , wearier , than with the spectacles ; his skin was gray with the strain he was under , and wattles that North had not noticed before hung from his jaw about his stringy neck . " I 'll be brief , " Hugh rapped out . " Did you get your phone call ? " " You must have heard the telephone ring , " Bracht growled . " Why do you ask me , then ? " " All right ; answer me this . At any time since your wife disappearedhave you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with have her ? " " I do n't have to answer that , " the scientist said in a surly voice . " No , but I ask because I 've got reason to believe that Tao Muong is still in the States , that whoever these people are , they 've led you out here on a wild-goose chase . "  |p93He  deliberately used an irritating know-it-all tone and it worked . Hans Bracht 's thin-lipped mouth almost sneered openly . " Which shows how much you know , " the missile man said harshly . " What would you say if I told you I spoke to my wife on the telephone a few minutes ago and she was here , in Bangkok ? " The G-2 operative donned a smug , supercilious smile . " And what would you say if I told you that it 's a ten-to-one bet that the woman you spoke to was n't your wife ? " he asked . " That 's an old trick , imitating voices . " It worked again . " This was Tao Muong ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know my wife 's voice ! And anyway , when I spoke to her in Hong Kong and before that , in San Francisco , she told me things that only she could possibly know . Intimate things ; things I did not like her to be saying in the hearing of those animals who stole her . It is Tao Muong , I tell you . " North rubbed his chin . " You 're positive ? " he asked . " I 've never been more positive of anything in my life , " the scientist said , and the utter sincerity , the complete lack of doubt , rang through his words . " All right . " Hugh nodded . " There 's one more thing . I wo n't go into it now because I have n't time , but I 'm pretty sure that somebody , not necessarily these people you 're dealing with , is out to kill you . " He ignored Bracht 's scornful grunt . " I do n't know who they are or what their pitch is , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the movie people picked you up " All accidental , " Bracht broke in . " I admit I was jumpy and when that car hit us I lost my head . As for the man they say tried to approach me when Miss Naline happened by , I still do n't believe he meant any harm . You 've seen Miss Naline ; she 's excitableand she imagines things . " " Just the same , " Hugh argued , " it would be smart for you to be careful . If you go out today , watch for " I 'm not going out . Not today nor tomorrow or probably the next day , if that gives you any satisfaction , " Bracht broke in . " It does , " Hugh returned quietly , " if you really mean it  --  if you 're not just saying that to get me out of the way . "  | " Believe me , I 'd like to get you out of the way , " the missile scientist said flatly . " It so happens , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel for the next few days , for reasons of my own . " " Then keep your door double-locked and have all messages pushed under the door , " the G-2 colonel advised . " I 'd also be very careful of what I ate . " Bracht thrust his head forward at the end of the long , scrawny neck . " Are you making the ridiculous suggestion that somebody might try to poison me ? " he asked . North hunched his shoulders . " It has been done , you know , " he replied . The sneer was back on Bracht 's lips . " I do n't know how you arrive at these deductions , North , " the older man said . " Do you really believe that the people who kidnaped Tao Muong would bring me out here to pay the ransom and then poison me before they got the money ? " " No , " the colonel conceded , " but this might be somebody not interested in the kidnaping of Tao Muong . " " Who ? " Hugh North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe he was n't the greatest prize a Red agent or a whole troop of Red agents could grab ? Bracht read Hugh 's expression and answered the silent question . " You mean the Communists ? But why would they poison me ? Kidnap me , yes , they might try to do that , but they certainly would n't try to kill me . " It was a question that had been bothering North . Why had They staged the taxi crash ? Why had Aloysius Robinson tried to get his hands on Dr. Hans Bracht ? Was Robinson a Red agent ; had that Chinese knife wielder been a Red agent ? Pokh had snorted at the idea of Robinson being anything but a cheap hood , never a man the Commies would pick to kidnap Hans Bracht , and the Manchu knifeman certainly had been no better than a crude cutthroat . The two incidents , the crash and the attempted encounter on the street , did not show evidence of the fine Communist hand . As for Robinson 's try at getting into Bracht 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amateur 's stamp , if , indeed , it had not merely been a drunk 's mistake.  |p95The  voice on the telephone had wanted to know details of the cab crash . Did that mean that the people who held Tao Muong were as much in the dark about that incident as North himself , or had that question been thrown in as a red herring ? " Well ? " Bracht was asking . North drawled , " Just the same , I 'd be careful . Do you know who owns this hotel ? " The frizzy head wagged in a negative headshake . " No , and I do n't care  --  what 's that got to do with it ? " " Only this , " Hugh said . " The owner is Chu Hoong . " Again that jolted reaction , but this time minus the fear that had shown in Bracht 's face when he had met Chu aboard the plane . Now the scientist was surprised , concerned , but he was not afraid . Hugh followed his reasoning ; Bracht had recently spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal for Tao Muong was still on despite Marchet 's appearance on the scene , Chu 's presence on the plane . Now Hans Bracht did not have to be afraid that the ransom deal might be wrecked , but at the same time he was disturbed by North 's announcement . " Chu Hoong ? The Chinese who was on our plane ? " " The man I asked you about , " the G-2 colonel reminded Bracht . " You said you never heard of him . " " I 've never known anybody named Chu Hoong in my life , " the missile man said stubbornly . " Maybe you knew him under another name , " Hugh suggested . The other hunched his shoulders . " I 've met a lot of Chinese people , " he said . " They all looked alike to me , and who can remember their names ? I 'm sure about the name Chu Hoong , though  --  never heard it before . " " And Marchet ? " North went on . " Do you want to tell me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit in ? " Hans Bracht shook his head again , savagely this time . " You said you wanted to speak to me for a second , " he rapped out . " Your second 's up and five minutes besides . Good day , Colonel North . " With which he turned and stalked through the connecting door ,  |p96back  into Room 439 . The door slammed and there was the snap of the lock being thrown . When this is all over , Hugh North told himself , I 'm going to give you a medal , Doctor . Most un-co-operative man I ever met . I hope I do n't have to hang it on your tombstone . Mary Hollberg looked charming . Dressed in a smartly cut suit of light green linen and wearing a hat that was stylish but not too absurd , she sat over an untouched cup of coffee at a table in the hotel 's main dining room , waiting , as Hugh North crossed toward her . Her smile was as sunny as the Bangkok morning and her blue eyes looked very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " You 're late , " she said with mock severity . " You told me to meet you here in a few minutes . It 's been "  --  she consulted a tiny jeweled wrist watch  --  " exactly twenty-three minutes . I do n't call that a few . " " I was held up , " North explained , slipping into the chair opposite . As the waiter drew up at his side , poured a cup of coffee , the colonel glanced across the gleaming white cloth . " Have you ordered ? " " Nein . " She used the German word instinctively but followed it in English . " I thought I 'd leave that to you . You seem to be so well acquainted with this strange part of the world that I thought you could probably get me what I wanted instead of some nasty native dish . " " And what do you want ? " " Oh "  --  she waved a spike-nailed hand , and the emerald ring glistened  --  " ham , eggs , toast . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No reason why not . " North laughed . " They have pigs here , and hens . I would n't say their ham is likely to be Smithfield , but we can be pretty sure of the eggs . " He used French to give a double order of ham and eggs , took a sip of the coffee , and madep97no effort to repress a wry face before he emphatically asked for tea . Miss Hollberg laughed delightedly . " Is the coffee not terrible ? " she asked gleefully . " I was waiting for you to try it . But surely I should have known enough to get tea , as you did . " She sighed . " It is so much better to have traveled as you have and know these things . " Nice try , Mary , but I 'll still bet you 've been here before and know all about Bangkok coffee . Still , a subtle touch , duly appreciated . Miss Hollberg was peering across the table at him . " You said your work brought you to the Orient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked . " Fairly often , " Hugh said carelessly , and moved a conversationalpawn to block a play aimed at opening up his defenses . " And you said this was your first trip out here . Has most of your concert tour work been in Europe , Fraulein ? " She sure uses her hands a lot when she should be sitting on them if she wants to be taken for a pianist . Or are all these hand motions signals to somebody else in the room ? He dropped his napkin , recovered it smoothly , but in straighteningfrom his bent-over position he swept the large dining room with a gaze that missed nothing . The Russian , Boris Salenkov , sat near the doorway ; Lex Ross and John Wallen had a table next to the window across the room . There was no sign of any other headlinersof the Tiger , Tiger ! troupe nor of Marchet or Chu Hoong. " . . . and my teachers have just now said I am ready for concerts , " Mary Hollberg was explaining , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this , mein Herr . That is why I hope so much that you will befriend a frightened little pianist . You have the look of  --  of a strong protector , Herr Boyden . That is why I have chosen you to be my friend . " Hugh gave a slight bow across the table . " I 'm flattered and delighted , " he said , " but I do have to tell you , you wo n't need a bodyguard in Thailand , Miss Hollberg . You spoke of elephants and tigers last night  --  you wo n't see any wild animals at all unless you go to the Royal Zoo , a trip I 'd advise , by the way . "  |p98The  girl pouted . " Then my shameless overture is being answeredby a no ? " " Not at all , " Hugh said gallantly , " but I 'm afraid old Charley Boyden wo n't turn out to be much of a protector if the need should arise , by any wild stretch of the imagination . You see , I 'm scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't believe it ! I see you as a  --  a- oh , as a man engaged in some very dangerous secret work , Herr Boyden , " Mary bubbled . She cocked her head to one side . " What are you really , Herr Boyden ? A policeman , as Herr Barrows called you on the plane ? Perhaps a  --  a jewel smuggler ? Or a spy ? " All these questions were asked in a laughing voice , but Hugh North , although his face bore a wide , almost inane , grin and although his eyes reflected nothing , caught the intensity that lay beneath the gaiety in those questions . Mary Hollberg was as anxious to find out who he really was as he was to learn what her game might be . He was saved the necessity of answering these too-bantering questions by the arrival of the waiter with breakfast . The ham and eggs proved remarkably good , by Eastern standards , and the tea was superb . Hugh took the offensive again while Fraulein Hollberg was busy with her meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know . " Were your teachersanyone I might know ? " The blue eyes came up and met his . " You are well acquainted in the music field , Herr Boyden ? " she asked . The wide shoulders lifted a fraction of an inch . " I 'm not what you 'd call any great student of music , " he replied , " but  --  well , I 'm not totally unversed , let 's say . I told you I spent a great deal of time in your country and there were the festivals , the great schools and teachers " It was his turn to move his hands expressively . " How could a person help but become interested in music ? And the piano has always been my favorite . " The pretty girl opposite Hugh took a swallow of tea , touched her lips with a napkin . " That is very nice , " she said . " And what took you to Germany , Herr Boyden ? Forgive a woman 's curiosity , but what kind of work is it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might ask you the same thing , Fraulein , " Hugh said , very quietly . The girl 's eyes were round as she looked up from her plate to stare at him . " But I have told you , " she said wonderingly . " I am " You 're not a concert pianist , Miss Hollberg , " Hugh broke in , his voice icy . The German girl started a protest , abandoned it as she saw the steel in North 's stare . Astonishingly , Mary went on to the attack . " And you 're no commercial traveler , " she flared . " Oh , I was not fooled by that story you told me on the plane . I know who you are , Herr Boyden or whatever your name really is . I know , all right ! " There was an odd bitterness in her voice that North could not account for . Unless , he told himself , she 's a fanatic Commie who'sbeen trained to regard all anti-Red agents as more evil than the devil himself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you realize you 're on a spot . You ca n't make a move we do n't know about . " ( He hoped she would accept that we and take it back to her superiors . ) " We can put a hand on you any time we like . Walk carefully , Mary Hollberg  --  very carefully , indeed . " The German girl 's face was white , but her eyes met his with a sort of desperate courage . " You can not prove anything ! " she choked . " I will say you lied . " North spread his hands . " If you can find anybody to listen , " he said . " There are places even here in Thailand where a person could yell  --  even scream  --  and not be heard . I hope we 're not forced to use methods that were perfected by your own countrymen , the Gestapo , Fraulein . " Now the eyes flashed with  --  yes , by God , indignation ! " I told you I was never a Nazi ! " Mary cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you would torture your prisoners , eh , Herr Boyden  --  ach , how gentlemanly are the verdammte amerikanische Polizei ! " " Hear , hear , " applauded a quiet , cultured voice behind Hughp100North . " What 's the matter , Miss Hollberg ; did you get a traffic ticket coming through Los Angeles ? " Hugh cursed the arrival of Lex Ross even as he rose , his face unreadable , and turned toward the motion-picture actor . Ross wore a white silk suit and an amused smile on his handsome face . His brown eyes under the heavy brows were curious as they looked past North at Mary Hollberg . " What 's all this about the damned American police ? " he asked . " Why spoil such a beautiful morning with memories of traffic cops , Miss Hollberg ? " The German girl did not move her hot eyes from Hugh . She sat still for a moment , transfixed by her strange fury , and then she pushed back her chair , threw her napkin beside her unfinished breakfast , whirled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubled hand to her mouth . Lex Ross uttered a low exclamation , then turned to Hugh . " What 's eating her ? " he asked . " Something I said ? " " No , " the G-2 colonel replied slowly . " It was something I said  --  but I 'm damned if I quite understand her reaction . " The G-2 colonel resumed his seat , erasing the puzzled frown from his face . He had cursed Ross 's arrival , but now that the aging star was here he welcomed the opportunity to talk to the man . Lex Ross knew that Henry Barrows was Hans Bracht . So did Georges Marchet and so , possibly , did Chu Hoong , although this last was open to doubt . Ross , from what little information Hugh had on him , was a sideline patriot , bond and USO tours during World War II , a Korean troop entertainment junket ; things like that . He might be convinced that he would be serving his country best by deciding that he had made a mistake in identifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Hans Bracht . If the conviction could be put over without admittingthat Barrows was Bracht . If anybody could take a **33;2096;TOOLONG figure into agreeing that silencep101and secrecy were worth a thousand times more than a headline in certain circumstances . " Have you eaten ? " he asked Ross , to break the silence that had followed Hollberg 's stormy departure . " I 'll have a cup of tea with you , " Lex said , his charming smile returning . " We 'll celebrate your escape from the Bangkok police , shall we ? " Hugh signaled a waiter , chuckling . " Oh , that . " To the Thaiwaiter he said , " Encore du the pour m'sieur et moi , s'vous plait . " To Ross he said , " Seems there was a slight case of mistaken identity there . " " What was it all about ? " Ross asked . " I tried to find out who 'd been murdered , but nobody knew anything . Or is it a state se-cret ? " " Somebody killed in an auto accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know is that it only took a phone call to that cop 's headquarters to clear me . " He finished his last piece of ham . " For which I was very grateful , " he added . " I do n't imagine you were very worried , " Lex said idly . " Well , no , not exactly . No shield like innocence , eh ? But I was afraid it would be a bit awkward , not knowing Siamese . Luckily , most officials speak French and a good many know enough Englishto get along . " " I was n't referring to your innocence , " Ross said calmly . " I knew a G-man would n't have any trouble getting out of a jam like that . " North 's brows rose in twin crescents . " G-man ! " he exploded . " That 's what you are , are n't you ? " Ross smiled . " The G-man assigned to protect Dr. Bracht ? " Hugh North laid down his fork deliberately , leaned back in his chair , and brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and , when Lex accepted one , leaned forward again to hold his lighter . That done , the G-2 colonel blew a stream of smoke toward the ceiling , leaning back in his chair again . " Mr. Ross , " he said pleasantly , " first of all , let me swear to you by all that 's holy , I 'm not a G-man . Boy Scout 's word of honor . Second , even if it were true that Henry Barrows is this Dr. Brachtp102you speak of , would n't it be your duty to keep it to yourself rather than go around telling every Tom , Dick , and Harry  --  and Charley Boyden ? " " My duty ? I do n't get you . " Hugh tapped a fragment of ash into the tray in the middle of the table . " You say this Bracht has shaved off his beard , that he 's incognito . Okay , if you 're right about this bone-structure business  --  and for all of me you may be that good at spotting people  --  is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his identity ? As I understand it , he 's in some pretty top-secret stuff . Are n't you taking a chance of the Iron Curtain boys overhearing you and getting curious ? " " Then you admit it is Bracht , " Lex Ross said . North stirred irritably . " I admit nothing . What difference does it make ? If he is Bracht you 'd be doing a damned bad thing for your country . If he is n't Bracht you might be getting a completelyinnocent stranger into a peck of trouble . Either way , to be blunt , I 'd advise you to button your lip . " Lex Ross flushed beneath his tan , but his smile held . " I 'm not known as a loose-mouth , Mr. Boyden , " he said . " I have n't mentioned this to anybody else . I would n't have said anything to you if I had n't known you were Bracht 's guard . " " Did you get that from my bone structure ? " Hugh asked acidly . He reached for the cardholder in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rudely scaled it across the table at Ross . " I do n't suppose you 'll believe it , " he said , " but there 's my business card . " Ross read the card : CHARLES P. BOYDEN , Boyden , Chase &; Bryn , Importers , 30 Rockefeller Plaza , New York 20 , N.Y . Phone : Circle 6-2750 . Cable Address : Chabroy . The actor ran a thumb over the engraving and nodded , smiling . " Very nice , " he said approvingly . " Twenty bucks says it was printed in New York too . Very thorough , you fellows . " North began a cuss word , stopped , and broke out laughing . " Okay , Ross , " he said . " Have it your way . I 'm a G-man and Barrows is Bracht and you  --  well , you can be a Russian spy to make it complete , huh ? " The waiter arrived with a fresh pot of tea and a cup for Ross.  |p103He  looked sadly at the remains of Mary Hollberg 's breakfast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , puss ? " " No , " Hugh replied . " Missee gone . " When the waiter had left , Hugh found Lex Ross still undaunted . " Listen , Boyden , " the actor said , " what you told me about keeping my mouth shut makes sense . I do n't intend to make your job any tougher . Matter of fact , my idea was that I could make it a little easier . " " Keep going , " North said with an expansive wave . " Do n't mind me . " " No , seriously . I thought maybe you could use somebody to  --  well , sort of look around , listen around , and see what was going on . " Oh , come now , " Hugh groaned . " I have a unique talent , Mr. Boyden . I told you I was a master at disguise . I am . I can make myself into practically any other man . Do n't laugh ; I mean it . Ask anybody in Hollywood . You want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance ? I can be a native bellhop , or whatever they call them here , in a couple of minutes and I can get in that room and listen and report back . Do you want to know what X tells Y when they 're alone ? I can be X or Y and the other will never know he 's not talking to the real thing . " " My aching back , " Hugh North wailed . There was a bite to Ross 's voice . " Try me , " he challenged . " Okay . " Hugh grinned . " Suppose you make up as that directorAnton Carss , and report back to me on whether his girl friend , Lita Naline , wears falsies or not . Or perhaps you know ? " The flush came and went in Ross 's slender face . His smile faltered but returned . " I expected something like this , " he said . " I did n't think you 'd take me at my word . But honestly , Boyden , I do want to  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean it . " " Afraid I ca n't play games with you , Ross , " the G-2 colonel said . " Sorry . " He looked around for his waiter . " Suppose I 've got some information you 'd like to have , " Lexp104Ross said softly . " Would you trade ? You use my services if I tell you what I know ? " Hugh North 's nerves tingled . This man had been edging around this for some time and now he was going to come out with it . To Ross , the colonel showed the derisive grin once more and turned back , hunting the waiter . Ross has got to talk ; he 's constitutionallyunable to keep from talking to get this " job " he wants . But Lex held his silence longer than Hugh thought possible . The waiter came , finally , and accepted North 's money , thanked the colonel for his tip , and departed , and Hugh was about to followwhen the master of disguise finally spoke in a low voice . " Watch Jack Wallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows something about Hans Bracht 's wife , a woman called Tao Muong. "  |p105Hugh  North had to walkaway from that dynamite-packed statement . He had to shrug helplessly , shake his head , keep his back to Lex Ross , and walk away . He might have wanted to grab Ross by the lapels of that beautiful white silk suit and shake down the actor for every scrap of information he had about this new , shattering angle , but he had to walk away . Colonel North had had to make many tough decisions in his career as a G-2 operative , but few had come harder than the choice between staying at the table , admitting to Lex Ross that he was a government agent commissioned to protect Hans Bracht , and leaving there with that jolting statement still quivering in the air , unexplained . Later Hugh might explain the practicality of his move ; he mightp106point out that he had all he needed , the word that John Wallen was somehow involved in the case of Tao Muong  --  the rest he could try to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might further explain that Lex Ross was going to be around ; if worst came to worst he could always take off his mask as a last resort and pump Ross then for the information the disguise artist possessed  --  or thought he possessed . He might say that to listen to Ross 's spill at that first opening would have been to invite a flood of jealous hearsay , exaggerations , even downright lies , from an old actor envious of the younger man who had taken his place as the top-billed star . Yes , he might have been able to offer a convincing brief to back up his immediate action in that dining room , but the truth was that Colonel Hugh North , U.S.A. , G-2 , acted more on instinctthan on any other factor . His blessed sixth sense told him that this was not the time to pay the sizable cost of Ross 's informationand he followed this warning as he had in the past . It had crossed him up on occasions , this sixth sense , but not often ; usually it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the dining room and started across the lobby , and despitehis inner turbulence he saw several things happen . He saw the Greek hotel manager at the desk look at him and immediately reach for a telephone . He saw the chief porter ( the bell captain in an American hotel ) raise his pillbox cap six inches from his shaven pate and replace it . He saw the elevator starter slam shut the door of one elevator and open the door of another , two cars down the line , not the next car . He felt , rather than saw , a half a dozen pairs of eyes focus themselves on him , watching him . The warning gong rang in North 's head . He started for the open-doored elevator , then at the last minute turned abruptly aside and made for the stairs . " Elevator here , sir , pliss ! " the starter barked . " Up ! Up ! " the elevator operator chimed in . " Telephone call for you , Mr. Boyden ! " the Greek manager suddenlyremembered . " Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He began to run before he hit the stairs , and he took the steps three at a time . He scrambled up thep107stairway faster than the elevator could have made it even if its operator had not been under instructions ( as Hugh was convincedhe was ) to have a breakdown somewhere en route . At the landing of his floor , Hugh took out his .38 and skidded around a corner , stopped in his tracks . His gun was held waisthighand pointed at the round belly of Chu Hoong , creator of Dragon 's Tooth Elixir , multimillionaire , and , it just so happened , owner of the Imperial Hotel in Bangkok , where his orders could move any and all members of the hotel staff . The Chinese looked at North impassively , glanced down at the snub-nosed revolver with the same bland unconcern . The almond eyes returned to Hugh 's and there was a faint smile on the small mouth over the goatee . " Am Ito understand that this is a robbery , Mr. Boyden ? " Chu asked gently . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my invitations with something solid to show my sificerity . I 'm inviting you now to visit Mr. Barrows ' room with me . " Chu 's smile widened . " That would be delightful , " he said . " As a matter of fact , I 've just come from there . " " I had an idea you had , " North grunted . " I trust you left him in good health . " The Chinese turned , shrugging . " I presume he was in good health . At least he was in good voice . He seemed disturbed , but of course it was hard to tell , speaking to him through the door as I did . " " Through the door ? " " Ah , yes . He is somewhat strange , this Mr. Barrows , is he not ? " " He may have reason to be where you 're concerned , Mr. Chu , " the G-2 man said , his pistol muzzle never wavering . " Perhaps what you said to him through the door was upsetting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see why it should have been , " he said smoothly . " I merely called to inquire if everything was satisfactory , as I make it a practice to inquire of all the Imperial 's guests when I am in Bangkok . " He smiled over his shoulder at North . " The personal touch , you know  --  I got thep108idea from reading about your so successful American hotel operators . " " I can imagine . " Hugh North smiled back . They reached the door of Room 439 and the Colonel rapped . " I said go away ! " Bracht 's voice was gruff , but now it was hoarse , strained . " Go away , Chu , or whatever you call yourself ! By God , if you do n't I 'll  --  I 'll get somebody who 'll make you go away . " Sounds as if he 's ready to co-operate with me , North told himself . For which heaven be praised . " It 's me , Boyden , " he called aloud . " Are you all right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bracht 's voice sounded again , relief dripping . " Yes  --  yes , I 'm all right . I slammed the door on him when I saw who it was . That little devil , he 'll stop at nothing . He  --  he 'll kill me before I get to " " It 's all right , " Hugh cut in hastily . " I 'll be with you in a minute . Sit tight . " Throughout this , Chu Hoong had stood there with a small , compassionate smile on his rosebud mouth . Now he whispered , " I understand . The poor man is ill , eh ? Or he drinks unwisely and that is why you have to care for him , poor fellow ? " North backed to his door , used his key to open it . The .38 gestured and Chu Hoong placidly walked into Room 437 . His eyes roamed the room and he clucked his tongue . " You see why it is wise for me to personally check on the comfort of my guests , Mr. Boyden ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded . They should have been replaced . One ca n't trust servants in these days no matter what one pays them . " He walked to the easy chair in the corner near the window and calmly seated himself , laced his fingers across his watermelon stomach , and regarded Hugh North half humorously . " If you are that poor man 's keeper you deserve an explanation , " he said . " More than that , you deserve a million apologies from this miserable bungler . I did not know Mr. Barrows was ill . They should have told me down at the desk . " " Suppose , " Hugh suggested , " we speak Cantonese . And please go slowly ; I am not very good at it . "  | " A generous gesture , " Chu singsonged in Cantonese . " The genuine knight meets another 's embarrassing inability to speak his language correctly by changing to the unscholared one 's dialect . Truly a splendid example of manners . " " I want to speak Cantonese so the one in the next room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , Chu Hoong , why do you fear Henry Barrows ? " A veil descended over Chu 's eyes , a veil Colonel North had seen come down over a thousand Chinese eyes and seldom had been able to pierce . " It is unforgivable to contradict a guest , but I must , " Chu said humbly . " I do not fear Mr. Barrows . If it did not sound like the boasting of a worm I would tell you that I do not fear any human . " " I saw fear in your eyes when you met Barrows on the air-plane . " " You did , honorable guest ? Then , if you thought you did you did , for what a man thinks he sees is true in his mind . Consider the man who loves an ugly woman ; love makes him see a beautiful woman and so she is beautiful and who can say she is not ? Not this insignificant one . " He unclasped his hands long enough to point a sharp-nailed index finger at his chest . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will harm your patient , honorable guest , and so , to you , I am a menace . But try to see me only as an innkeeper who desires that his guests have comfort and , succeeding in that , you will find no demon  --  only an old and weary man who is ashamed that his oversolicitude disturbed an ill person . " He bowed his head , his face woebegone . " What can I do to repair this thoughtless error ? " he asked . " You can stay away from Henry Barrows , " North said coldly . " You can make sure no harm comes to him while he is your guest . Because if ill befalls him I will feel duty-bound to go to General Genung with certain thoughts and views . " Chu 's face , raised again , did not move a muscle , but there wassomething , a passing shadow in those agate eyes , an inner changebehind that impassive mask , at the mention of the name Genung . " The general of whom you speak has long been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have the shameless conceit to think any man , even you , would find it difficult to alter General Genung 's regard for me . " " I , too , am not unknown to General Genung , " North countered gravely in meticulous Cantonese . " The general was gracious enough to be concerned about the taxicab accident last night and he may be interested in the two attempts to enter Room 439 of the Imperial Hotel . " The ghost of a smile played on Chu 's lips . " I infer that my hospitable visit is to be reported as an attempt to enter Room 439 ? " he asked . " It may be , " North said steadily . " And the other ? " " Was attempted early this morning by a man who calls himselfAloysius Robinson of Macao . " Now , for the first time , Chu Hoong let his face mirror his emotions . Black anger surged through the multimillionaire 's expressionfor a fractional moment before Chu brought his features back under control . " Aloysius Robinson , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man , as anyone in Bangkok will tell you . His father once did me a great favor , and since the father 's death I have taken it upon myself to try to help the boy find himself . I must confess I have had little success and a great deal of disappointment . To you , honored guest , I must admit I am at my wit 's end about what to do with Aloysius Robinson . " " Perhaps if you ceased putting a cushion under him to ease his every fall the pain of a bruise might cause him to hesitate the next time he is tempted , " North suggested . " I believe it has been you who have always rescued him from the hands of the police when they would chastise him ? " The little fat Chinese bowed . " It is wrong , I know , " he admitted , " but I have allowed myself to think that Aloysius has been persecuted , as he claims . You may not know it , but the Chinese in Thailand hold no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and talents to help the country progress and even though we control a great percentage of all Thai trade and industry , the native Siamese looks upon the average Chinese asp111an inferior person . The Chinese defendant in a Thai court seldom receives the same kind of justice as a Siamese . " He held up a hand to cut off North 's remark . " You may be about to say that Aloysius Robinson is Macanese , not Chinese . The same discrimination exists against a Macanese as against a Chinese , Mr. Boyden . I will admit that Aloysius has been seriously at fault in several incidents that have occurred in Thailand  --  I will even admit that the Thai police have little reason to be kind to him  --  but when he finds himself in trouble I always fear he will be unjustly treated and so I come to his aid . " The shadow of a smile came again and Chu added : " The strange thing is that my own sons consider me unjustly strict in dealing with their affairs . But what would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robinson because he has not had the advantages the gods were good enough to enable me to provide my sons . " With which Chu Hoong arose from his chair and walked toward the door . " I knew nothing of Aloysius ' attempt to enter Room 439 , " he said sincerely . " As for the earlier incident that resulted in his arrest , Aloysius assures me he meant only to assist the gentleman . I will speak to him about this more recent affair . I know he was drinking last night and possibly he became so befuddled that he mistook that room for his , one floor above . I shall have him moved so that same mistake can not occur again , if that is the explanation . If there was some other motive I will try to find it out and Aloysius will be punished . " He smiled at Hugh North . " Does that answer all your ques-tions ? " " Unless you 'll tell me where and when you knew the man in the next room , " the G-2 agent said seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You mean Mr. Barrows ? I have never known a Henry Barrows before now . I swear it . " " And he has never known a Chu Hoong , " North said grimly in English , then added : " But I 'd bet my last dime you knew each other under different names at some time  --  and you were n't bosom pals , either . "  |p112Chu  paused , his hand on the doorknob . " Conjecturing is a dangerous pastime , Mr. Boyden , " he said pleasantly . " Curiosity is hardly less perilous . We have a saying : He who reaches into the tomb of Time risks being bitten by the roused serpent . Itloses in the translation but I think you can see its wisdom . Good day , Mr. Boyden . " When Chu had gone and Hugh North was sure he was out of earshot , the G-2 agent crossed to the connecting door to 439 and rapped . Bracht 's response was immediate ; the hostility with which the scientist had greeted every other approach was gone . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the missile scientist unhesitatingly unlocked the door and came barging into North 's room the moment the colonel turned the knob on his side . The older man glared wildly about the room , then turned toward Hugh . " You 're sure he 's gone ? " he demanded . " Is that door locked ? " When North nodded the scientist walked to the window and pulled down the shade . Turningback , he showed a certain defensive belligerence . " I know this looks foolish , but that man  --  you do n't know him , North . He 's a killer . He tried to get to me so he could shoot me or stick a knife in my ribs . I know it ! " " Why ? " Hugh asked softly . " Why would a millionaire like Chu Hoong want to kill you , Doctor ? " The mulish look came back to Bracht 's face . " I do n't intend to tell you , " he said . " All I can say is that it has nothing to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Positive ! " There was no doubting Bracht 's sincerity there . " Well , then , is Chu hooked up in any way with Georges Marchet ? " The scientist 's first reaction was a headshake , but he qualified the negative after a moment 's thought . " I do n't know , " he said slowly . " To be honest , I ca n't say . Possibly . "  |p113North  walked to the edge of the bed and sat down . " Doctor , " he told Bracht earnestly , " it 's time you leveled with me , as I asked you to in the cab before the accident . Which was no accident , as you must realize by now . " Bracht took the chair Chu had just vacated and rubbed his forehead with long , bony fingers . " I thought it was , " he said . " Now I 'm not so sure . Perhaps you 're right . Perhaps somebody 's out to kill me . " His hand came down and knotted itself in a fist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they 'd only leave me alone until I get Tao Muong back they could try anything they wanted . I 'm worried for fear they 'll interfere in the ransom negotiations , that 's all . " " By they , you mean Chu Hoong and company ? " Bracht nodded . He was a far different man than he had been when North had seen him last . Chu 's appearance at his door had shaken him badly and , North had no doubt , for the reason he had just given ; it was not primarily that he feared what Chu Hoong would do to him in this mysterious vendetta but that Chu 's moves might ruin the ransom negotiations to which he clung with such naive faith . " We 'll see that they do n't interfere if you 'll work with me , " the colonel said . " Otherwise you 'll be playing a lone hand against what looks like a lot of power on its home field . " Bracht 's haggard eyes dragged up to meet Hugh 's . " I  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grudgingly , " but if the ones who have Tao Muong found out about it they 'd think I was playing tricks on them and they 'd " He broke off , shuddered visibly as he imagined the kidnapers ' revenge on his wife . " They wo n't know , " North said urgently . " I can almost promise you that the kidnapers wo n't know I 'm working with you , not if you give me full co-operation . " He saw Bracht shake his head drearily and gave up that tack momentarily . " All right , " he said , " can you do this  --  can you tell me who Georges Marchet is ? " Bracht hesitated a long minute , his long hands twisting between his knees . Finally  --  and it was a decision that Hugh hailedp114as the first big break in Bracht 's determined silence  --  the scientist nodded . " Georges Marchet was a small sometime planter in Indochina , " the missile man explained . " When I escaped from Germany and made my way to the Orient  --  and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped me ; there still might be reprisals  --  I was directed to Marchet . The Japanese occupied that territory , of course , but Marchet seemed to get along well with them . Perhaps it was because he was a drug addict and would kowtow to anyone to get his dope . " He looked down at his long hands and shook his head . " I suppose I should n't speak of him so , seeing what he did for me , but I ca n't help it , " he went on . " I hate drugs and drug addicts with all my heart , North , and Marchet helped me only because I had money  --  lots of it and in gold . " " How did he help you ? " " He guided me through Indochina to the Siamese border , " Bracht explained . " Thailand was not as dangerous as Indochina from the standpoint of Jap patrols ; the invaders ' posts were pretty well confined to the rivers . Of course there were pro-Japanese irregulars and bandits and always the jungle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holed up in a native village near Chiang Mai until the war was over . The people were friendly ; they hid me whenever a Japanese patrol came through . When it was safe I started for Bangkok on foot . On the way I met Tao Muong in Chainat . We fell in love and  --  well , you know the rest . " Hugh North kept his eyes fixed on the doctor . " That 's the whole truth ? " he asked . " You did n't leave anything out ? " Bracht swung his hollowed eyes around to meet the colonel 's . " It 's the truth , " he said simply . " And Georges Marchet recognized you only as a man he guided through Indochina ? Did you use your own name while you were hiding out ? You must have been clean-shaven or he would n't have known you on the plane . " Bracht nodded . " I used another name but  --  well , on the way to Thailand one time , when we seemed almost certain of being taken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out alive he must letp115somebody know what had happened to Hans Bracht . " He smiled mirthlessly . " It 's strange how a man 's ego will demand that somebodyknow of his death , when it ca n't possibly matter to him . " " And you were clean-shaven during all this ? " " While I was with Marchet , yes . In that native village I let my beard grow again . " Hugh frowned . That did n't fit . " Then how is it that Chu Hoong recognized you ? " he asked . " Was he with Marchet ? Did you meet Chu during the escape from Indochina ? " " No . No , Chu , or whatever he calls himself , was not with Marchet , nor did I ever see him while I was out here , hiding from the Axis . " " And that 's the truth too ? " Bracht 's eyes were steady . " That 's the truth too , " he said , and North believed him . " Well , then , where did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never knowing a Chu Hoong , please ! Where did you know the man who now calls himself Chu Hoong , Dr. Bracht ? " The old rejection was back in the missile master 's eyes , the wide mouth was set in that familiar tightened line again . " I said I would n't tell you , " the genius told the G-2 colonel . " I meant it . All I can say is that this Chinese has nothing whatever to do with Tao Muong . " " And yet you say he wants to kill you , " the colonel said grimly . " You want protection from him and you wo n't tell me why you think " I 've told you too much already , " Bracht broke in desperately . " If the people who have Tao Muong knew I was sitting here telling you everything I know , they 'd  --  they 'd " His headdropped to his big hands and he uttered a low groan . North studied the missile scientist , wrenched between frustratedanger and sympathy for this great man who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new slant . " How well do you know John Wallen ? " he asked abruptly . Bracht 's head came up with a jerk , his eyes wide . " Wallen ?  |p116You  mean the movie star ? Why , I do n't know him at all . He was on the plane with the rest of them ; that 's all I know about him . " " Did your wife ever know him ? " Bracht shook his head violently . " No , of course not ! Tao Muong never met anybody unless I was with her , and I tell you I never saw Wallen outside the movies until he boarded that plane at Hong Kong . " Hugh reached for a cigarette , stuck one between his lips , and hunted for his lighter . As he spoke , the cigarette moved up and down . " You say your wife never met anybody except when you were with her  --  she must have met somebody alone . " " It 's impossible ! Whom did she meet ? " " Her kidnaper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashen as his eyes fell away . " Yes , " he muttered . " Yes , you 're right . I 've wondered about that . She  --  she used to complain about not being able to leave the apartment when I was not there . She was under strict orders not to let any stranger in the house  --  even the tradespeople were not allowed inside . You see , I was afraid for her . She is so tiny ; she is so trusting . I was afraid she  --  she 'd be molested . I was very strict about her not letting anybody come close to her when I was n't there and yet  --  and yet the kidnaper got to her ; she must have let the kidnaper in the apartment . " " Tell me , Doctor , " Hugh North said , " were there signs of a struggle when you came home that day and she was gone ? " " No , but that means nothing . She 's such a little thing , and fragile  --  what kind of struggle could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why did you ask me about knowing Wallen ? " " I was told that Wallen knows something about Tao Muong , " the colonel replied . As agitation rose in Bracht , North continued swiftly . " It came from a source I 'm doubtful about and there may be nothing to it . " " B-but Wallen ! It 's ridiculous ! Why would a man who makes the money he must be involved in a kidnaping ? " But this is more than a simple kidnaping , Hugh said silently , and the Reds find their converts in strange places . " I told you Ihave n't put much faith in it , " he said aloud.  | " Who told you that ? Who knows about the kidnaping ? You promised you would n't do anything that might " And I have n't , " North broke in . " This was a word dropped out of nowhere . I said I 'd level with you and that 's the only reason I told you about it ; otherwise I 'd have gone ahead and given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it is , I said I 'd keep hands off and I will unless I 'm forced to make a move . " The missile man 's face was tortured . " Please , for God 's sake , do n't do anything to wreck the situation . They 're edgy enough now ; if you tried to find out about Wallen They 'd certainly take it out on my wife . " " I 've said I 'd leave it alone unless I absolutely had to go into it , " North said . " Will you co-operate with me a little in return ? " Bracht 's eyes were wary . " What do you want me to do ? " " I want you to sleep in here , " the colonel said . " I want you to spend your time in here ; you can leave the connecting door ajar ; you wo n't miss your phone call . I do n't like those windows  --  they 're fine for cross ventilation but they 're fine for a sniper , too . " Bracht scoffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least not until after they get their money . " " I think we 're dealing with two sets of people , " Hugh returned . " One gang is holding your wife and wants you kept alive ; the other wants you dead , from the looks of things . It 's the second bunch that makes me afraid of those windows . How about it ; will you use my room ? If you 're worried about the kidnapers knowing the difference we 'll keep the shades of both rooms drawn . " It took some time , but Hans Bracht finally nodded reluctantly . And Hugh North , considering his previous progress at earning Bracht 's nods , scored it as a major victory . The missile genius had no more than given his assent to North 's plea when the telephone on Hugh 's night table shrilled . Pokh ? The G-2 colonel answered and listened to an arrogant voice on the other end of the line . " Boyden ? This is Jack Wallen . " North clamped down in his surprise , pressed the receiverp118tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry to Bracht . " Yes ? " " I saw you talking to Lex Ross at breakfast , Boyden , " the actor went on . " Did he say anything about me ? " " I do n't think I understand , " Hugh countered . " Look , Boyden , do n't play games with me . Either Ross said something about me or he did n't . I want to find out . " " Why not ask him ? " There was the harsh bark of a laugh at the other end . " You think he 'd tell me ? He knows I 'd kick the living hell out of him if he admitted it . I ought to anyway , just on general principles , the old jerk . That 's it -- he 's so old he knows I ca n't slug him , but I can go to Carss and have him cut out of Tiger , Tiger ! And I will if he keeps telling lies about me . What did he say about me this morning ? " Hugh 's eyes switched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the connecting door and was entering his own room , obviously to avoid the appearance of eavesdropping . The G-2 colonel lowered his voice . " What makes you think he told me anything ? " he asked . " Oh , I can tell whenever the louse has dropped another one about me ; he gets a smirk on his face like he 'd just won an Oscar . And he kept looking over toward my table to make sure I was n't coming up on him while he was spilling the hot poop . " " Mighty flimsy evidence you 've got , do n't you think ? " North asked . " Or are you extraordinarily good at reading a man 's face from fifty feet away ? " " Do n't hand me any of that stuff , Boyden , " Wallen said roughly . " If you knew Ross you 'd know his word is n't worth a plugged nickel . Ask him who Walter Wells really was sometime when he gets sounding off about other people and then watch him curl . Yeah , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shove down his throat if I wanted to . " " Look , " North said , " I 'm not sure what this is all about , but I do n't want to get involved in any grudge between you two fellows . "  | " So you wo n't tell me what he said about me , huh ? " " Why should he say anything about you to me ? I just met the man on the plane yesterday . Why should he  --  " " I told you he 's a screwball , " Wallen interrupted . " A stinkin ' snoop . He 's Ah , to hell with him . Listen , the main reason I called you is I 'm having a little cocktail party this afternoon . How about dropping by ? " " Well " North hesitated . He had promised Bracht he would not follow up the Wallen lead , but would accepting this surprising invitation break that promise ? " Come on , come on , " Wallen was saying . " You 'll have a good time . Lita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does a strip tease . Of course Anton takes her away before she gets going real good , but once in a while she gets peeled before he knows what 's going on . How about it ? " " Why  --  ah  --  I 'll certainly do my best . " " Four o'clock , " Wallen said . " Depending on you . " The receiver went down with a crash and North replaced his own phone , looking down perplexedly at the instrument . Why had Jack Wallen suspected that Lex Ross had cracked about Tao Muong ? Had Lex dropped a word to Wallen ? Was this room bugged and Wallen at the earphones , listening to him talk to Hans Bracht a few minutes before ? For the second time since he had checked into Room 437 , Hugh North gave the place a going-over and this time he made it thorough . When he finished his work he was as sure as he ever permitted himself to be about anything that there were no listeningdevices in this room . When Bracht moved over to 437 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but North was reasonably certain that They  --  neither group of Them , if there were two  --  had put an ear in either room . He went through the connecting door and found Bracht stretched out on his bed , his hands behind his head . " That was John Wallen , " the G-2 colonel said bluntly . Bracht sat up with a lurch . " What did he want ? " Hugh said , " He wanted to invite me to a cocktail party he'sp120giving in his rooms this afternoon . Or at least that 's what he said . I do n't know what he really " Bracht 's phone sounded . The scientist 's long arm flashed out and he answered eagerly . " Yes  --  yes ? " His face fell as he heard the voice which Hugh knew , by its crackle across the room , was Wallen 's . Disappointed because it was not the kidnapers , Bracht listened listlessly and said at the first pause : " I do n't believe I can , thank you , Mr. Wallen . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rest . But thank you very much for your thoughtful invitation . " He hung up the phone and turned to North . " Imagine him inviting me to a silly cocktail party . " And added reflectively , " But Tao Muong would have enjoyed it so , would n't she ? All those motion-picture people  --  she would have been in her seventh heaven . " North nodded , but absently ; he was realigning some conclusions . His first thought when John Wallen , a movie star , had invited Charley Boyden , a nobody , to a cocktail party had been that Wallen either wanted Bracht left unguarded or wanted him , North , to come to his rooms at four o'clock for a talk about those suspicions of Ross 's blabbing . The invitation to Bracht had changed the aspect  --  unless Wallen had anticipated somethingalong that line of reasoning and had made the Bracht call to meet that possibility . " Do you have any objections to my going to the party ? " the colonel asked Bracht . " I mean , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Be it explained here that Hugh North usually did not show such tender regard for the feelings or opinions of others connected with missions to which he was assigned . Ordinarily , the colonel considered only the best way to deal with the problem at hand and seldom if ever the effects of his operations on other persons . But in the case of Hans Bracht his first need as he saw it was to establish a rapport between his ward and himself , build Bracht 's faith in him . If the missile man , always the temperamental genius , insisted on playing his lone hand North 's job would be that much tougher , that much more liable to meet disaster through Bracht 's refusal to co-operate . Therefore , North held it a smallp121concession to make to Bracht 's fear and ego to ask permission to attend a cocktail party , in view of the closer relationship it might lead to . ) Bracht 's considered the G-2 agent 's question and finally shook his head slowly . " I suppose not , " he said with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pry into " He caught himself and looked up at North from under his shaggy eyebrows . " I did n't mean that , " he said gruffly . " I take you for a man of your word . " " Thanks , " Hugh said . " And if you 'll move into my room while I 'm gone I think you 'll be reasonably safe from whoever might have ideas about harming you . " He did not add , because he could go only so far with this frank and earnest business , after all , that he intended to take added precautions for Bracht 's safety by asking Captain Pokh for plain-clothes protection ( if the Bangkok Imperial Troop possessed such things as plain-clothes men ) for Rooms 439 and 437 while he was sipping martinis ( unpoisoned , he hoped ) with John Wallen . The cocktail party was in full swing that afternoon when Colonel Hugh North pressed the ivory doorbell button of Suite Seven-D . Barely muffled by the door were the typical cocktailpartysounds , the rumble of intermeshed voices spiked occasionallyby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimly as a Tiger , Tiger ! underling opened the door in response to North 's ring and the colonel was greeted by a billowing wave of tobacco smoke , perfume , and the warmth of close-packed humanity . He wedged himself down a short entrance foyer crowded with Westerners he knew to be lesser lights of the location company and managed to get into the suite 's living room , where the jam was only a little less rib-crushing . Most of the throng were Americans , but there was a sprinkling of Siamese men , apparently Bangkok andp122national Thai officials with whom the movie people wanted to maintain good relations . He looked about for his host and failed to find him . He did see Lita Naline , more beautiful than ever and even at this distance noticeably drunk ; Lex Ross , Anton Carss , Boris Salenkov ( and who would have thought that Comrade Boris would have been included on the guest list or would have accepted ? ) , and Mary Hollberg . Mary apparently had gotten over her breakfast-table mad . When she met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lex Ross , bore down on North as fast as the crowd would permit . " Ah , it is so nice you came , " she enthused when she came up to Hugh . " They told me you 'd been asked , but Jack  --  Herr Wallen  --  was n't sure you would come . " She was wearing a white dress with a square-cut neckline that did not have to plunge ; it started low and stretched across one of the most perfectly rounded pairs of breasts it had ever been Hugh North 's pleasure to try not to ogle . As though to assure the colonel that these proud promontories were not the product of Akron , U.S.A. , Fraulein Hollberg almost immediately dropped her handkerchief and , before Hugh could move , bent to retrieve it . Hugh , always the gentleman , veered his eyes away  --  when he finally managed to tear them loose from the beauty so generously displayed . " I am so clumsy , nicht wahr ? " Mary asked as she straightened . Or so adroit , Hugh told himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten quite a crowd together on short notice . " " Oh , he told me he invited everybody who was on our plane , " the German " pianist " explained . " Also , there are some people of the motion-picture crew who were here in Bangkok earlier , makingready for the picture . " " I see . " North nodded . He looked around the room again . " And where 's our host ? " Mary gestured with her blond head toward a closed door . " In there , " she said . " He is a little betrunken . Oh , very charmingly drunk , but he said he thought it advisable to lie down for ap123moment . Meanwhile , the party goes on . " She looked at Hugh 's empty hands . " But you have no drink  --  come , we will fix that . " North saw there would be no danger of a Mickey Finn , because in the absence of a bartender ( perhaps Wallen had started out in this capacity and had sampled his own concoctions too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary fought their way up to the soaked and spotted cloth-covered table and the G-2 colonel mixed a mild scotch for himself , gave the German girl the double martini she asked for . " Viel Gluck , " Mary said , and drank . She eyed Hugh over the rim of her glass . " Perhaps I should not do this , " she said . " I am apt to become  --  what is the word ?  --  reckless after so many of these . And maybe I would shock the oh-so-proper Herr Boyden if I did , no ? " " No . " Hugh grinned . A surge of the crowd behind him pressed him against Mary , and the German girl 's body responded in a manner hardly recommended by the book of etiquette . Despite his years , his long experience with women on the make for diverse reasons , Hugh felt the back of his neck turning red . Just what the hell did Mary Hollberg intend , a torrid session in this crowded room ? " And you have forgiven me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more room for herself and succeededonly in undulating closer to North . " Forgive you ? For what ? Oh , the verdammte amerikanische Polizei bit ? Consider it forgotten  --  and I 'm not a damned cop , you know . " " I know . " Mary looked down at her glass and sighed . " It was that I am so  --  so ill tempered in the mornings , Charles . " Ah , so we 're now Charles , are we ? " I should never , never see anyone before noon unless " She did not finish the sentence ; she didnot have to ; the implication was there that she could be quite charming before noon if not forced to leave her bed . " We all have the same trouble , " Hugh said heavily . " And you did not mean it when you said I was no " Well , for God 's sake , look who 's here ! " caroled a sopranop124voice in North 's ear . " Did you bring that cute little old man with you , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to greet Lita Naline , a Lita Naline who either had had a head start on everybody else here or who let alcohol take over with no checkrein at all . If Mary 's dress was low cut , Lita 's was lower , but this seemed to be the result of some disarrangement rather than the design of the afternoon gown . Lita appeared to have been mixed up in a rassling match sometime during the party , by the clewed bodice and the condition of her coiffure . Still , she was beautiful , possibly the most beautiful woman North had ever seen from the standpoint of pulchritude and nothing more . Lita Naline or Lily Novotny , the fates had endowed this young woman with perfect , flawless symmetry of feature , a body that might be exaggerated in places but never bovine . It had been suggested by a columnist that Lita had been born a couple of hundred years late ; in other days she doubtless would have been a king 's mistress and would have shared history 's limelightwith Madame Pompadour . As it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition  --  knew Lita was doing all right . In claiming the affections of Anton Carss she seemed assured of roles her histrionic abilities never would have earned for her , and her pay check was one of the biggest in Hollywood . She had had five husbands for varying stretches of married bliss and according to the thinly veiled remarksof the gossip columnists she had burned out all five before tossing them onto the discard pile . Only the fact that the word " nymphomaniac " was taboo had prevented the columnists from coming right out and telling their readers that Miss Naline was insatiable . And also , at the present moment , quite drunk . Hugh saw that she was one of the fortunate women who did not become bulbous about the eyes , nose , and mouth when stoned . Her beauty did not suffer from her inebriety ; indeed her dishevelment rather added a titillating note to her allure as to a girl flushed by excitementbeyond bothering to care if her hair was precisely arranged.  | " Where is he ? " Lita demanded now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little ole man I rescued ? " " You mean Mr. Barrows ? " North asked . " Does n't look like he could make it . " " What 's his room number ? " Lita asked . " Give ' m a call ; invite ' m personally . " Anton Carss , short , bulgy , his dark face creased by a soft , tolerant smile , was suddenly at Lita 's elbow . " He 'll probably be here later , darling , " he said quietly . " Give ' m a call , " Lita said , and lurched away . Carss threw North a tilted-eyebrow look , shrugged his dumpy shoulders in a silent plea for understanding , and trailed after the star of Tiger , Tiger ! Hugh turned back to Mary Hollberg . The German " pianist " was looking after Naline and Carss and for the first time the colonel saw a hardness in those blue eyes , a cold calculation that vanished as the girl felt Hugh 's glance upon her and looked up to meet it . " Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North . " I 've often heard the term dripping jewels ' "  --  Hugh nodded  --  " but this is the first time I 've actually seen jewels drip from a woman . And speaking of jewels , I 've admired your ring so much , Miss Hollberg . " The girl held up the emerald on her knuckle , wriggled her finger to make it give off green fire . " Is it not an excellent imitation ? " she asked with a laugh . " Our German scientists are unexcelled at ersatz  --  they had to learn to be during the war , you know . " " Oh ? I never would have guessed it was n't real . " And it is , sister , it is ! " Nein . I bought it in West Berlin for a few marks . It was too expensive for me to afford , perhaps , but it is worth far less than the smallest diamond in Miss Naline 's cheapest bracelet . " She heaved a sigh that swelled the square-cut bodice to the danger points . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewels , Mary Liebchen . No man will ever think you so  --  so delectable that he will give you diamonds and rubies . "  | " Perhaps a silver wedding ring is more precious , " North suggested . The German girl 's eyes flashed up . " You think so ? Hah , how old-fashioned that sounds , Herr Boyden . Perhaps you are right , but most of the women I know would prefer to have the jewels first and later the precious silver wedding ring . I "  --  she darted her eyes up at North and dropped them again  --  " would ask for neither if I found the man attractive , if he pleased me . " This was getting into deep water , but Hugh North sailed on . " That would be a very fortunate man indeed , " he murmured . " I envy him . " Hollberg 's lips curved in a smile . " You have no need to because I am trying to say " " Good afternoon . I am Boris Salenkov , textile commissar in the government of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first thought was that Mary Hollberg came close to throwing her drink into Salenkov 's face for interrupting . His second thought was that Boris Salenkov was the most RussianlookingRussian he had ever met . If he was a Red agent , the MVD had outdone itself in putting on the Bracht case the best double-switch operative conceivable . In his career Hugh had matched wits with many Soviet secret agents , dating back to the old OGPU days . He had met and dealt with a range of operatives that had included every type from brutish strong-arm torturers to cultured women in the highest circles of society , but this was the first time ( if Salenkov actually was an agent ) that he had faced a man who fitted so exactly the picture of what a Red undercover man should look like and never did . " You are Mr. Boyden , " the Russian said , his accent thick , " and you are the Fraulein Hollberg . Of the People 's Republic of East Germany ? " Mary Hollberg shook her head . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberately turned her back on Salenkov . To Hugh she said , " Please excuse me . It has become unbearably close all of a sudden and I must have fresh air . " Then she was gone.  |p127North  found Salenkov looking after the departing " pianist , " his stare murky . " She is hiding something , that woman , " the Russian said without looking at Hugh . " I know she is not what she says she is . " " Oh ? " " Always when I have tried to speak with her she has run away from me , " Salenkov rumbled . " I think she fears me because she thinks I am from the police . " " And you 're not ? " Hugh asked calmly . Comrade Salenkov transferred his stare to the G-2 colonel . " No , " he said seriously . " As I explained , I am a textile commissar . I am on a world tour , seeing the factories of the United States of America and also those of Southeast Asia so I can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth in my credentials . " " I see , " North murmured . " And this Fraulein Hollberg , why does she fear the police ? Because she is a deserter from the People 's Republic of East Germany , of that I am almost sure . She has betrayed her country for "  --  a contemptuous wave of a thick hand at the surrounding hurly-burly  --  " this depraved luxury and now she fears she will be taken back to justice . " " She says she 's a concert pianist , " North offered . " Ho , who would believe anything a German says ? " Salenkov scoffed . " They are an ungrateful people , the Germans ; they accept all the generosity of the U.S.S.R. and give nothing in return . And then they desert their country and tell lies about us . They are undependable , the Germans . " He fixed Hugh with the small eyes behind their spectacles . " Why are you traveling in this country ? " he asked bluntly . " Have one of my cards , " North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engraved cards that Lex Ross had seen . The self-styled Soviet textile commissar studied the slip gravely , nodded , and tucked it in his breast pocket . " The U.S.S.R. has no need of importers , " he informed Hugh . " The U.S.S.R. produces the finest goods in the world and so we do not need to bring in a single thing . Instead , we export and the day will come when every nation will depend upon the Soviet'sp128good will to obtain the products they will need to survive . Good-by , Mr. Boyden . " With which Boris Salenkov of Moscow trudged off . Hugh watched him attach himself to one of the lesser lights of the Tiger , Tiger ! company and introduce himself , as stolid , as stupid , as he had made himself appear to Hugh North . It was about time he was getting out of here , the colonel told himself . His only interest in making this party had been the possibility that John Wallen might volunteer something about his possible connection with Tao Muong or somehow settle in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a bum steer . If the latter had proven the case , Mr. Ross would have had some explaining to do  --  something that was on Hugh 's list for Lex Ross in any case . However , with the host passed out and with this affair developinginto such a rat race there seemed no chance to do any work here . Hugh decided to have one more drink and then leave . He had contacted Captain Pokh and the little captain had assured him that Rooms 437 and 439 would be well covered by an invisibleThai plain-clothes man , but North 's doubts about the efficiency of the Bangkok Imperial Troop made this absence from his ward a somewhat uneasy time . There also was the question of what claim Chu Hoong might have on the plain-clothes man . If Chu had been telling the truth when he had claimed close friendship with General Genung , would anybody in the Bangkok Imperial Troop prove trustworthy when the chips were down ? He went back to the bar , tipped a light scotch into his glass , and added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ross sidled up to him . " My rooms are next door , " he murmured . " Ca n't we get out of this madhouse and talk ? " " I read somewhere that the best place to tell secrets was in a crowd like this , " Hugh retorted . " Nobody listens to anybody else . " " Whoever said that never meant a Hollywood cocktail party , " Ross grunted . " Some of us have developed the fine art of hearing everything said across a room while talking at the top of our voice.  |p129You  'd be amazed . I sometimes think we 're turning into a nation of lip readers or perhaps it 's extrasensory perception . Those who ca n't hear do their damnedest to . For instance , I understand Wallen called you up and asked you what I said to you . " Hugh nodded . " Did you tell him ? " " No , " North said . " I did n't want to get mixed up in any personal feud between you two . Anyway , I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked about him , lowered his voice another notch . " You 're interested in Tao Muong , all right , " he muttered grimly . " You 're interested in everything about Dr. Bracht . " " Ah , yes . " Hugh smiled . " That 's right , you did say something about this  --  Kayo Mung , is it ?  --  being the wife of this guy Bracht . " Ross 's face darkened . " God damn it , " he growled , " when are you going to admit that 's Hans Bracht you 're with ? I tell you I want to help you . " North fired one round into the darkness . " Look , you ask so many questions perhaps you 'll answer one for me . Who was Walter Wells ? " Jack Wallen 's suggestion that the colonel put this question to Ross produced results . Ross had been scowling ; now he lost his scowl , dropped his attitude of near belligerency , let his eyes drift away from North 's stare . " So that 's it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I should have guessed . " His eyes came back . " But that was a long time ago , " he protested . " I  --  I thought I 'd made up for that . I was told you fellows would n't hold that against me . " North waited . Ross looked about him again and then burst into a smothered , impassioned protest . " I made a mistake , sure , but do I have to have it hung around my neck all my life ? I did n't know they were  --  well , yes , I guess I did toward the end , but as soon as I found out I quit , did n't I ? I told you fellows everything I knew , did n't I ? You 've got to remember that this was when being a pinko was the fashionable thing to do . Hell , most of usp130went into the damned thing just to go along with the crowd . I never really believed any of that Marxist stuff . " " And Walter Wells was your Communist party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at him . " Of course  --  you knew that , did n't you ? That 's why you wo n't give me the time of day , is n't it ? " Hugh shook his head , his smile in place . " To be honest , no . Somebody just told me to ask you that question , that 's all . " The graying actor turned a black glare toward the closed bedroomdoor . " That bastard Wallen , was n't it ? " he grated . " Someday I 'm going to kill that guy , I swear . " " Whoa , " Hugh counseled . " Do n't talk like that . " " Well , I will ! Who does he think he is , smearing anybody ? Look up his record , Boyden . Oh , you 'll find plenty there . Did n't he refuse to testify before that congressional committee and was n't he almost blacklisted on every lot in Hollywood before he finally got scared and went to Washington and told a lot of lies ? He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreads stuff about me , does he ? He 's not going to get away with it this time ! " He wheeled and started for the bedroom door . North 's hand shot out and caught the actor 's elbow . " Easy , Ross , " the colonel warned . " Leave me alone , " the other man snarled . " No , I 'm not going to let you get yourself messed up , " Hugh said . " Take a swing at him here , with all these people around , and you 're going to start a lot of talk , attract a lot of attention . " " Who cares ? " " Well , suppose I care , " North said quietly . " Suppose a fight between you two got some people upset whom I do n't want upset ? You say Wallen knows something about Tao Muong , Bracht 's wife  --  what if this personal battle between you and Wallen interferedin some way with Dr. Bracht 's plans , the plans of the people Bracht works for ? " Ross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face North . " You mean you 're finally admitting that it is Hans Bracht ? " he asked . " Do you mean  | " Never mind what I mean , " North said in a clipped voice . " Just take it as I 've put it . Any commotion involving a man who knows something about Hans Bracht 's wife , as you say Wallen does , could be a damned dangerous thing at this time . Take my word for it . " Ross hesitated a moment and then nodded . " Okay , " he said . " I 'll be good . Someday you might find out that if you 'll take me into your confidence I can But never mind ; I guess youwill in your own good time . " " Now , what 's this about Wallen knowing something about Tao Muong ? " the colonel asked in a low voice . " I do n't know , " Ross admitted . " He only said  --  well , we were having breakfast together this morning and the talk got around to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the way they will , and " Who brought it up ? " " I guess I did , " Lex said after a pause . " I 'm not positive but I think I was the one who started it . Anyway , I could n't help asking Wallen if he 'd ever seen Hans Bracht and Wallen said no , he had n't . Then he gave that nasty laugh of his and said he knew something about Bracht 's wife , Tao Muong , that one of the scandal rags would pay plenty to get . I asked him what it was and he said what did I think he was , asking him to give away a million-dollar piece of information like that ? " " Million-dollar information ? You mean the scandal magazines pay big ? " " No , he was talking about blackmail  --  oh , maybe not in cash but something he could use to put pressure on somebody when he needed it in his career . He 's done that before , plenty of times . Oh , he 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no-good bastard ! " The master of disguise remembered what had been said before his break for Wallen 's door , and his voice deepened with intensity . " About that Walter Wells business , I swear to you that " Wheeee ! Look , everybody ! If a Turk belly dancer can do it halfway in Rome , I guess I can do the complete job in Bangkok ! "  |p132North  spun , as did everybody else in the room , toward the shrilled announcement . It was Lita , and she quite obviously had somehow gotten away from Anton Carss 's restraining care . Her black hair was loose and swirling about her shoulders , which were bare . As was the rest , every lovely inch , of Lita Naline . There was a hush for a moment and then two male voices split the air simultaneously . " Lita ! " cried Anton Carss in outrage . " Atta girl ! " howled Jack Wallen from the door to his bedroom . Carss fought his way through the transfixed crowd toward the naked Lita , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaving breasts . Wallen clung to the doorframe , his face red and swollen from alcohol and laughter , and bawled his drunken hoots . " Aw , leave her alone , Anton ! " he yelled . " What the hell , everybody'sseen it all , anyway . " Carss , the director , hesitated in his frantic efforts to reach his star-mistress long enough to cast Wallen a look that was as lethal as a kris . The drunken man in the bedroom doorway caught the glare and laughed louder . " Ask anybody ! " he bellowed . " You think you 're the only one that ever had any of that ? Be honest with yourself , Carss , like your head-shrinker is always telling you  --  admit you 're getting the leftovers after everybody in Hollywood and Malibu got tired of banging it ! " He guffawed again , then ducked as an ash tray came sailing at him , thrown hard though wide by the party 's impromptu nautch dancer . Lita hurled herself at Wallen , her full breasts bobbing , her fingers crooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hate . " God damn you ! " she screamed . " God damn you , you godp133damn pervert . You fairy . You " There followed a blast of epithets that made even Hugh North shudder . Carss caught her a moment before she reached Wallen . The pudgy director seized her about the slim middle , heaved her over his shoulder , and bore her , kicking and yelling , toward the door . En route , one of the Tiger , Tiger ! underlings recovered from his paralysis enough to strip off his madras sports coat and throw it over the part of Lita that was nearest to him . One of the motionpictureindustry 's highest paid stars , therefore , exited from John Wallen 's cocktail party with her bottom covered in handsome red- , black- , and green-striped cloth . The door banged behind Carss and his burden and the suite was quiet except for Wallen 's gasping chuckles . The host recovered his breath enough to wave his hands at his guests . " Come on , come on , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Belly up , folks , and we 're off and drunking again ! " He fumbled his way toward the array of bottles on the clothcoveredtable , and Hugh noticed that at his side was Fraulein Mary Hollberg , smiling invitingly up at Wallen as she steadied the drunken actor . She must have her eye on a pair of emerald earrings to go with that rock on her finger , North said silently , and then laughed at himself ; how much had jealousy to do with that thought ? Hell , the girl probably was as awed by motion-picture stars as Bracht had said his Tao Muong was , and who could blame her for cozyingup to the most glamorous man in the business ? And that reminded North ; he had been too long away from Hans Bracht . Chu Hoong had not been among the party guests ( Hugh could not imagine the Chinese accepting an invitation to such a brawl , even if he had been invited ) and at the present moment Chu was the number-one menace to Bracht in North 's mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bidding his host good-by and thanking him for his hospitality . Instead , he slipped out of the throng unnoticed , descended to the lobby 's cable desk to send off a coded query to Washington . Then he went up to Room 437.  |p134Pokh  's man turned out to be surprisingly good at hiding , at least . Colonel North had to look closely to find a small individual in a niche shielded by a potted palm . The G-2 agent gave the signal agreed upon with Captain Pokh , a left-handed salute , and used his key to open the door of Room 437 . Hans Bracht lay snoring on the bed , obviously worn out from the days and nights of tension that had been his lot since Tao Muong had disappeared . Hugh checked the scientist 's breathing , smelled his breath , and knew that this was a natural sleep not induced by any of Their subtle additions to the lunch he had shared with the scientist . Hugh walked next door and spent nearly ten minutes checking Room 439 for a possible bug , finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two phones early that morning . He was stripping off his shirt preparatory to taking another shower ( for the Bangkok day was very humid ) when the phone in 437 jangled . He got to the instrument before it rang again and answered in a muted voice that could not disturb the sleeping Bracht . His instinctive check of his wrist watch showed the hour as 5:57 . " Hey , Boyden , where 'd you get to ? " It was Jack Wallen . " I had to leave , " Hugh explained . " Sorry I missed you . " " But somebody told me you were there for the show Lita puton . Hot stuff , huh ? " " Very  --  uh  --  unusual . " " Unusual 's the word , son . Hey , what I called you about , I 've got to see you privately . I got something to tell you . Something that 's maybe right down your alley if you 're a cop , like Ross says . " North kept his curse silent . " Ross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wo n't tell anybody . But I 've got a piece of information you might like to have . " " Look , Wallen , I do n't know " " Oh , cut out the horse crap , Boyden . Ross may be an old jerk but he would n't have any reason for saying you 're a cop if you were n't , would he ? Does the name Tao Muong interest you ? " As North held his breath Wallen laughed hoarsely . " I thought that 'd jar you . You come on back up here in  --  well , I 've got a littlep135business to finish up , but I ought to be free in fifteen minutes . Tell you what  --  I ' 11 give you a call when you can come up . " Before Hugh could speak the phone went crashing into its cradle . North hung up slowly , glancing at Bracht on the bed as the missile scientist groaned and stirred in his sleep . The G-2 colonel asked himself just how far he could go in adhering strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty on this case was to protect the scientist from anybody who might try to harm him , help recover Bracht 's wife , if possible , and get the space-travel genius back to Cape Canaveral . Would Wallen 's information , whatever it was , help expedite any of these things ? Well , certainly it could not hinder , and unless he used the information Wallen might give him to grab Tao Muong 's kidnapersbefore the snatchers made their move it could not be considered breaking his word not to interfere . North decided that when Wallen called back he would say yes , he 'd be right up . Meanwhile he had fifteen minutes in which to grab that shower . The G-2 agent stripped and submitted himself to a stinging needle spray that washed some of the weariness  --  and the griminessof that sordid scene in Suite Seven-D -- from him . Then he dressed leisurely in a fresh shantung silk suit , mixed himself a highball with some decent scotch , and lay back on Bracht 's bed to wait . Fifteen minutes passed , twenty , twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed and walked the floor of his room , passing his hand over his close-cropped head . Had Wallen passed out again ? Had he forgotten the call or was the " little business " he had had to finish up stretching out this long ? Or was Wallen in trouble , possessing that dangerous knowledgeand as loose-lipped with drink as he had been ? The colonel went to the phone , had the operator ring Wallen 's suite . There was a lengthy series of ring-clicks and then the singsongvoice of the Thai operator informed him that Suite Seven-D did not answer . North told himself Wallen could be deep in another alcoholicp136slumber or in the shower or gone for a walk ( in this heat ? ) or  --  or The colonel left the room , marked the plain-clothes man still in place , and mounted the stairs to the seventh floor again . OutsideSeven-D he pressed the ivory button , bore down on it . No response . He tried the door and found it locked , so he went to his slender bunch of keys . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed into the suite . His watch showed him it was 7:06 . Its crowd gone , Seven-D revealed itself as including a large , sunny living room gorgeously furnished with oriental pieces  --  although the place was littered with the remains of the party now  --  its picture window looking out over the Menam Chao Phya . A haze from the cigarettes smoked there that afternoon still hung low over the room despite the efforts of the air conditioner to draw it out . A cabinet radio near the picture window provided muted American dance music that had been drowned out by the clamor of the crowd earlier . North walked through the room to the open bedroom door . It required only a step over the threshold onto the thick carpeting of the bedroom to find John Wallen . The handsome actor was not handsome now . Coatless but otherwise full dressed , he sprawled on the bed , his sightless eyes staring at the ceiling , his arms outflung , fingers curled as though he had made a final grasp at life and had missed . His long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his death throes his heels had dug into the coverlet , bunching the spread . From his chest thrust the carved hilt of the dagger that had silenced John Wallen forever before he could tell Hugh North what he knew about Hans Bracht 's wife , Tao Muong.  |p167Before  he put in a call toCaptain Pokh , Hugh made a swift and searching examination of the body , Wallen 's effects , and the disordered suite . Except for a tiny cut on the dead man 's upper lip , the body showed no other wounds than the fatal stabbing . Wallen 's pockets yielded nothing at all . On the bureau were the things he would normally carry in his trousers , wallet , keys , handkerchief , lighter , cigarettes . His jacket , hung in the closet  --  his trunks had not been unpacked  --  contained nothing beyond a fountain pen ; the side pockets of the coat , in fact , were still sewn shut as they had come from the tailor , apparently to keep the star from breaking the jacket 's perfect line by shoving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided those needed to open his trunks andp138it required only a few minutes for the G-2 colonel to explore them and come up with nothing of value  --  unless one counted as valuable a packet of pornographic pictures , several of which showed " models " who bore at least a startling resemblance to well-known movie stars . Hugh 's nose wrinkled as he looked at them , but through his disgust came the reminder that Lex Ross had said Wallen was not above using blackmail to pressure his way ahead in his profession , if not actually to wring cash out of his victims . He stuck the pictures in a hip pocket ( no use letting the Thai police lay hands on them until he was a little more sure of Siamese police ethics ) and went on with his examination , moving into the living room . It proved a hopeless task to get any worthwhileclues from that mess if there were any there and the colonel returned to the bedroom . This information Wallen was supposed to have about Tao Muong , was it written down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his head ? And if Wallen did have anything tangible was it kept in some secret pocket , possibly a false heel compartment ? It was a long shot , but the G-2 agent made a second swift search of the body , hunting for a hiding place on Wallen 's person such as he , North , would use . He found no secret pocket or false heel but he found something else . As he was removing the shoe from the dead man 's right foot he smoothed over one of the folds of the rumpled coverlet . There , pressed deeply into a crease , was the emerald ring that Hugh North had last seen on the finger of the self-styled pianist , Fraulein Mary Hollberg . North picked up the ring and stared at it , his brows lowered . So little Mary was mixed up in this thing , eh , and in what capacity ? Was she the executioner They used to silence unsuspectingmen They wanted removed , men who set themselves up for the death stroke when they lost themselves in anticipation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell , anything was possible with Them  --  but North 's instinctive answer to his own question was no.  |p139A  Red killer would never be so careless as to leave an emerald ring on the murder scene , a finger pointing straight at her . Mary Hollberg might have proved a strangely inept bungler for a Red agent in her choice of roles , but this was too much to expect from even the most incapable operative on the MVD payroll . This was a heavy knife and , popular belief to the contrary , it required considerable strength to drive a knife into a man 's chest , as this blade had been driven . If the knife had gone in under the rib cage , slanting upward  --  but it had n't . Mary Hollberg might have used both hands to do the job , but it would have been an awkward thing and one easily avoided by the man on the bed . If he had been awake ; there was always the possibility that he had passed out again , after dalliance with the delectable Mary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fraulein Hollberg 's defense attorney ? He reached for the bedside phone to call Captain Pokh . It was as though the instrument anticiptated him ; it rang with a shrillness doubly amplified by North 's tension . The colonel hesitated only a moment and then lifted the phone from its cradle . " Hullo , " he muttered . " Mr. Wallen ? " " Who 's calling , please ? " North hoped his voice somewhat approximatedWallen 's but he doubted it . " This is  --  are you Mr. Wallen ? " The question was sharp . " No , " Hugh acknowledged . " Mr. Wallen ca n't come to the telephoneright now . Who 's calling ? " " Who is this , please ? " " A friend , " North stalled . " Can I have Jack call you back ? " " Ah "  --  there was a moment of indecision  --  " no . No , never mind , thank you . Thank you very much . " The connection was broken by a click at the other end . North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where did that call to Seven-D come from  --  outside or another room in the hotel ? " the colonel demanded . " The hotel , sir , " replied the operator . " Penthouse . Mr. Chu Hoong , sir . "  |p140Ca|ptain  Pilanung Pokh was on the spot within three minutes of North 's call . The captain was in his element ; his brown eyes sparkled , his little body took on a bantam-rooster strut that North would have found entrancing under any other circumstances . The undersized officer headed a platoon of men , all of whom were almost identical to their commander , minus the strut . " Always I want to solve high-class murder , " Pokh told Hugh confidentially , and with relish . " Now you make present of one . Excellent . I show you what I learned from books , Colonel . First we grill everybody who was in this room today , eh ? " North thought back to the crowd that had attended the cocktail party . When he had been there , there most have been at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting for talking space , guzzling drinks , munching canapes , and , at the end , eying Miss Lita Naline 's opulent charms . If Pokh intended to question each one it was going to be one of the biggest mass " grillings " on record and doubtless the slowest . " Maybe there 's another way , Captain , " he suggested . " I know Wallen was alive at five fifty-seven . He phoned me then and said he wanted to see me . He told me he 'd call me back in about fifteen minutes , after he finished up some business . When he did n't call back I phoned him and then came up here . " " Finish up business ? What business ? " " He did n't say . The party was over ; I know that . There were no noises in the background , and even if he called from the bedroom with the door shut there 'd have been some noise , with that mob . " But Mary Hollberg would n't have been noisy , getting ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to kill Wallen would n't have been loud about it . " In such case , " Pokh was saying , " we only got to find out who here at five fifty-seven and after that , till you find him at ten minutes past seven , eh ? Is easy . " You think so ? Hugh asked silently.  | " Together we have murderer in double-speed time , you see , " Pokh said confidently . " You help me with this investigation , Colonel North ? " Hugh rubbed his chin reflectively . " I 'm sort of on a spot , Captain , " he told Pokh . " You know I 'm here on a big job , a job that 's even bigger than murder . But this killing may be hooked to my mission . I want to find out everything I can about it , who killed Wallen and why , but at the same time I do n't want to let anybody know who I am if I can help it . And I want Henry Barrows , the man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether . " Pokh 's face fell . " Had idea we could make team ; you show me how big-shot American Intelligence colonel works . " " Well , I do n't know about the big-shot angle but I 'll do anything I can to help . " North smiled . " Suppose we work it this way : I 'll suggest a list of people to question and some of the things you 'll want to ask them . I 'll be just another suspect for the time being  --  be sure you treat me like one . Now if you could have the room where you do the questioning outfitted with a listening deviceI could sit in on your interrogation in another room and possibly come up with some ideas as you go along . " " Oh , sure . " Pokh nodded . " Bangkok Imperial Troop has newestlistening machines . You see . Who 's on list of suspects , pliss ? " " We 'll start off with Fraulein Hollberg , " Hugh North said . He had not shown Pokh the emerald ring that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought himself to believe that the Germangirl could have been Wallen 's killer and he was reasonably sure that to produce the ring found under the dead man 's foot would mean the end of any investigation so far as Pokh was concerned . Which , if the ring had been planted , would be exactly what the real killer  --  possibly a Communist hatchet man  --  had intended . Hugh North had always mistrusted too obvious clues , even in dealing with relatively minor cases . Now , with so much at stake on this mission , he was doubly reluctant to take the emerald ring 's significance at face value . If this was a Commie killing linked with the Hans Bracht case , to snap up red herrings too quickly might result in a fatal bone in the throat . Mary Hollberg would not gop142far , even if she tried to run . Bangkok was not an easy city for a pretty German girl to move about unnoticed ; Thailand was a difficultcountry to get out of except through the few easily covered transportation termini . Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cornered burglar , a jealous rival , an outraged husband  --  the one who had used that knife could n't run . The main job was unfinished and any risk entailed in staying at the scene would be nothing compared with Moscow 's displeasure at a task left uncompleted , no matter what the agent 's predicament . Pokh and his men set up the Siamese version of a " bug " ( antiquated by American standards but still serviceable ) in Wallen'sliving room with an earphone connection stretched to a room across the hall . Hugh realized that all these preparations would be known to Chu Hoong before they were completed , but that could n't be helped . Besides , the Chinese multimillionaire had not been at the party ; he had phoned after the killing , something he would hardly have done if he were involved , and he was clear of suspicion of murder in Hugh 's private opinion . North was beginning to form his own idea of Chu 's possible part in this whole involved drama , and nothing the G-2 man had come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dragon 's Tooth Elixir , would have any reason for wanting John Wallen dead . Then , when they were ready to begin the questioning of the people Hugh listed for Captain Pokh , the strongest of the G-2 colonel 's theories took a left hook smack in the eye . Fraulein Mary Hollberg , it developed , had flown the coop . She was not in her room ; she was not in the hotel . When last seen by the doorman at the main entrance of the Imperial Hotel she had been hurrying , nearly running , out of the building in what the doorman 's translated description was " an extremely agitated condition , as though very frightened . " The time of Mary 's departure ? Six-ten , or just about the time that John Wallen had expected to finish up his " little business . " " Ho ! " cried Captain Pilanung Pokh . " Now we have dragnet ! Hot dog ! " The " dragnet " out , Pokh finally was restrained enough to getp143on with the questioning of the other people on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Pokh . Ross said he had left the party shortly after Lita Naline had been carried out and had not returned . He had stayed in his suite , adjoining Wallen 's , passing up dinner because of too many hors d'oeuvres and intending to eat a light supper later . No , he had heard no screams , nothing at all , through the wall from Wallen 's quarters . He did n't have a single idea of who might want to kill John Wallen . " But you overheard to say you yourself kill Misser Wallen some day , " Pokh pointed out . " You say that only hour before John Wallen found dead . How is this ? " Hugh North , sitting across the hall with the earphones in place , wished again that there had been a chance to install a one-way mirror somewhere so he could watch the faces of those questioned . Not , he consoled himself , that he would be likely to see much in Ross 's face ; the actor 's long career in movies gave him complete command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ross : " I was joking . " Pokh : " You sure , Misser Ross ? Informant says no joke the way it sounded . " " Who is your informant , may I ask ? " " You may ask but I do n't tell . Why you want to kill Wallen , eh ? " A brief silence and then : " All right , I was burned up at Jack at the time . He spread some  --  some loose talk about me and I resentedit . But I would n't kill him , for God 's sake ! " " But your room 's right next to Wallen 's , eh , and connected by outside balcony ? You in Seven-C , next door . You could come back in here when Wallen alone , after cockstail party , and use knife " " I tell you I did n't . " Pokh : " We see . You stay in hotel , Misser Ross , till we say okay for you to leave . " Anton Carss : " You 'll have to forgive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This has hit me very hard , sir . I was not especiallyclose to John Wallen as a person , I admit , but he had ap144great talent as an actor . A great talent . My picture will suffer from this shocking loss . " There was the sound of a deep sigh . " And I had such great hopes for Tiger , Tiger ! " " You do n't make movie now ? " North heard Pokh ask . " Oh yes , we 'll go ahead with it . The studio will fly somebody out to take Wallen 's part . We 'll have to reshoot the footage we canned in Hollywood , but that 's not too much , thank heaven . Yes , we 'll go ahead , but it 's Lita 's reaction to this tragedy that I fear most of all . She was very fond of Jack in spite of their professional differences . " " Mebbe so fond you do n't like it , eh ? " " What do you mean , sir ? " " I mean people at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her clothes off . You do n't like these things . Mebbe you do n't like them so much you come back and stab Wallen . " " Ridiculous , " Carss snorted . " Wallen was drunk and Lita  --  Lita had invited insults by her reckless behavior . She should not drink , Captain , for when she does But that has nothing to do with this terrible thing . " " Mebbe not . Misser Carss , Wallen tell somebody he has business with someone after party . You head of movie people here ; was business with you ? " " No , not that I know of . " " Okay , does name Tao Muong mean anything to you ? " Hugh North tensed , trying to interpret the inflection of Carss 's voice when he replied . " Tao Muong ? I 've heard that name somewhere . Let me think . I 'm not sure but I think I heard Jack Wallen mention the name to somebody , not me . I overheard it , I think , and I believe it was Wallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And who is Tao Muong , Captain ? " " Do n't know , " Pilanung Pokh answered , truthfully , because North had not told him . " Is all questions for this time , Misser Carss . Stay in hotel until we say all right to go , pliss . " " But we 're scheduled to go on location , Captain ! The camp 's set up , everything 's ready . If there 's any delay it 'll cost the studio a fortune . "  | " Ho , couple of days we catch murderer , all right . Do n't you worry about that . You got to wait for new actor anyhow , do n't you ? " " Yes , but we can shoot around him on location until he 's ready to work . Please , Captain , it 's imperative that we keep to our schedule . " " We see , Misser Carss . Good-by , puss . " Lita Naline : " Omigod , my head . Ca n't I have just a little drink , Captain ? I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he did have more enemies than anybody ; there was n't a shred of decency in the sonofabitch when he wanted to be mean . " But there I go , that 's just my hangover talking , and with all that liquor just sitting over there you could at least give me one little drink . " A pause . " Thanks , but are you sure you can spare it ? I said a drink , for crissake . " And what do you want to ask me questions for ? Did n't they tell you I was blacked out when it happened ? If anybody 's got an alibi it 's me because Anton can tell you I was in bed all the time . Instead of asking dumb questions you 'd better look and see if Jack took any pictures of me when I was  --  well , when I was undressed . He thought that was funny , getting a girl plastered and then taking pictures of her , the louse . But I do n't mean that . How about another drink ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ? When we busted up I came damn near doing it myself . But we made up , honest . We got along fine . Ask anybody . " I do n't know anything more about anything . I only hope the guy they send out to take Jack 's place is n't some B-picture jerk that 'll ruin Tiger , Tiger ! How about letting me go , Captain ; my head 's splitting . " Boris Salenkov : " I know nothing about this . I protest against being questioned . It is an outrage . Have you never heard of diplomaticimmunity ? " Captain Pokh : " Is understood you are not diplomat ; you arep146industry commissar making inspection tour . Very sorry to disturb you but there are questions , pliss . " Salenkov : " I refuse to answer them . Unless you want to create an international incident you will not detain me any longer . " There was a lengthy pause and then Pokh asked , " In your country , if official Thai person making inspection journey happened to be on scene of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Salenkov : " There are no murders in the U.S.S.R. They are for-bidden . " And that was all that Pokh got out of the Russian , that and the promise that Moscow would protest to Thailand about this high-handed treatment of a Soviet textile commissar . " Is nothing , " Pokh said gloomily when North rejoined him . " Is all lying , look like . Except mebbe lady who was sleeping off too many cockstails . Mebbe-so Misser Carss , too . He so worried about movie picture he would n't stab leading man , you think ? " North shrugged without replying . That black glare he had seen Carss deal Wallen when the dead man had been hooting at Lita 's nakedness had been murderous . However , a man 's instinctive reaction to ribald comment concerning his mistress did not mean that man would wait nearly an hour before his flash-fire hate exploded into murder . " Is Mary Hollberg , certainly . " Pokh nodded wisely . " When we find her she confesses everything , I bet you . " " Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face it , it could have been any one of that mob that was here this afternoon . Wallen had a pretty ugly background ; how do we know one of the electriciansor cameramen or assistant directors who knew Wallen in Hollywood did n't have a grudge against him ? He seems to have been a grade-A heel , all around . " " Job is to question everybody at party , then , " Captain Pokh said . " Misser Wallen invite everybody on plane , everybody in movie , to drink cockstails with him , so everybody now in Bangkokwho knew him was here , hey ? "  |p147Hugh  North pursed his lips . " Not quite everybody , " he amended . " Besides Barrows there were two men aboard the plane from Hong Kong who were n't here while I was here , Chu Hoong and Georges Marchet . " " Oh , Chu Hoong never go to cockstail parties , " Pokh said . " Not even big SEATO affairs or Thai government receptions ; he say no to all . Who is this Georges Marchet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hugh explained . " A pretty shabby character . Wallen probably cut him off the invitation list ; I do n't think he 'd have added much , even to this mob scene . " " You think mebbe this Marchet so mad he not invited he kill Wallen ? " " No . " Hugh smiled . " It was just a thought . One of your men might check up on Monsieur Marchet , see if he 's registered in the hotel , where he was when Wallen was killed . Nothing to it , probably , but we might as well cover the angle . " Pokh spoke a word in Thai to one of his lieutenants . The undersized officer exited , accompanied by a private . The telephone rang for Pokh and the captain seized it eagerly , listened , and replied in Thai , his face falling . " Thought we got Mary Hollberg , " he told North when he hung up . " Not so . " He shook his head . " Do n't know why dragnet has not found her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be identified a mile away walks free . Very bad . " He squinted at North through his faintly slanted eyes . " Why you not sure like me that Mary Hollberg kill Misser Wallen ? " he demanded . " Oh , I can see ; you say yes when I say we catch her and solve murder but you do n't mean it . Why is this ? " " I do n't know , really , " Hugh admitted . " First , of course , there 's the question of how a little girl like Mary Hollberg could drive that dagger into Wallen 's chest . If it were a belly wound or even a back wound I could see how she could have managed it , but a chest wound  --  and what was Wallen doing all this time ? He was a pretty big man ; even drunk he should have been able to protect himself against Mary Hollberg . " " Troop surgeon says there is cut on dead man 's lip , " Pokhp148offered . " Mebbe-so Mary Hollberg hit him in mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You seldom knock people out with a punch in the mouth , even a roundhouse , " North said . " Mebbe-so Misser Wallen asleep . " " That 's more like it , " the G-2 colonel agreed . " But if he was , that wrecks the surprised prowler theory and another one you 've doubtless considered , the girl fighting for her honor and picking up a knife that happened to be lying there and What did you find out about the knife , by the way ? " Pokh sniffed . " Is common enough in Thailand , " he said . " Cheap copy of old-time ceremonial knife , Phra Naret dynasty . Hundreds made here in Bangkok for export , valuable curio , but Siamese use it for everything , chop meat , carve wood , even women use it to cut cloth for dresses . Can buy in any shop , ten bahts , fifty cents , U.S. " " I saw a curio shop in the lobby downstairs , " North said . " Are these knives sold there ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sold there ; Chu Hoong own factory where ceremonial knifes are made and must surely sell them in his own hotel . " " He really owns the knife factory ? " " Oh yes . Chu Hoong own mostly everything in Bangkok , pretty near . " He turned as the lieutenant he had sent to inquire about Georges Marchet burst into the room , chattering in excited Thai . Captain Pokh listened and his round face glowed as the lieutenant rattled on . When the underling was finished at last the captain whirled toward North . " Is important break in case ! " he cried . " Hotel elevator man and porter both say Georges Marchet came up here to seventh floor and ask which way to Suite Seven-D , this place . " " So he was invited to the party , eh ? " " Not so ! This was after party over . Georges Marchet did not ascend to seventh floor until after six o'clock . Was here when Wallen murdered ! "  |p149Now  , what the hell ? How could the seedy French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bracht through the jungle to the Siamese border when the missile scientist had been escaping the Nazis , be mixed up in the murder of John Wallen , the film star ? Had Wallen 's information about Tao Muong somehow implicated Georges Marchet and , if it had , how in the world had the Frenchman known Wallen was ready to spill ? Or was Wallen mixed up with dope ? North had heard the dead man accused of a full list of crimes , but narcotics had never been mentioned . As for Wallen possibly blackmailing Marchet on the dope angle ; that was pretty far-fetched . Ross had said Wallen used his blackmail information to pressure people into advancing his career , not to get money , and how could Marchet help Wallen , either professionally or with cash ? " Marchet is registered here ? " North snapped . " Oh yes . " Pokh nodded . " Not high-class man like other guests , so they put him in little room near kitchen . Is back entrance nearby . Monsieur Marchet can come and go through back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also can skip hotel bill easier that way . Very suitable . " " I should think Chu Hoong and his manager would want to put guests with doubtful credit somewhere where they could keep an eye on them , " Hugh observed . " Oh no ! Monsieur Marchet is expected to skip bill . They put him in cheap room so they do n't lose so much when he skips . Same time they make it easy for him to skip , save face all around . " " I see , " Hugh murmured gravely , as though he did . " Let us go arrest this Monsieur Marchet , " Pokh said . He got up from his chair and shook his heavy pistol down into place . " This one we will give real grilling . My goodness , we got to grillsomebody . " " Mind if I come along ? " Hugh North asked  | " Pleasant honor . May need excellent American help in subduingsuspect , eh ? " North remembered the wreck of a man he had confronted on the plane from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addict when the vague " International Department " was mentioned . " I doubt it , " he said . North followed the undersized captain to the elevator and accompaniedPokh to the ground floor , rear , and the door of Room 14 . It was the shabby , behind-the-scenes part of the hotel , the hallway narrow and dark and dirty , the air full of stale kitchen smells mixed with a stench from the alley which ran behind the Imperial . North had been in these seldom-seen parts of luxury hotels before and he never ceased to marvel at their contrast with the glittering lobbies that were so few feet and yet so many worlds removed . Here , in this narrow , unkempt corridor under the same roof as sheltered John Wallen 's luxurious suite , dwelt dingy disappointment and ignominy made more poignant by its contrast with the showcase that hid it from public view . Pokh , the swaggering officer again , rapped sharply on the door of Room 14 , waited a moment , and then drew his heavy revolver . " Just a second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a key here that will open it . No need to shoot off the lock . " " Oh , I have master key from hotel manager , " Pokh said airily . " Was going to shoot off lock to show you Thai police know all modern methods . " Hugh smothered the impulse to give way to helpless laughter . " I 'm convinced they do but you might as wellHe stopped and clutched the little captain 's arm to silence Pokh . Inside Room 14 there was the scrabble of feet , the crash of an overturned chair . " Arretez ! " shrilled Marchet , inside . And then : " M'aidez ! C'est le meurtrier de l'acteur ! Mon Dieu , c'estThere was the smash of a gun , deafening in the close confines of the room beyond . North 's own pistol was out and speaking as it blasted the lock Hugh had just kept Pokh from shooting . " The alley , " the colonel yelped at the little captain , and yanked open the door , flung himself through.  |p151He  went in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inexpertsnap shooter 's invariably high aim . He guessed right . There was another gun blast , a streak of orange flame cutting the darknessnear the pallid square that marked the alley window , and Hugh heard the sizzle of a slug a foot above his head . There was the crash of glass and a figure , indistinct in the dark room , crowded the window as the gunman flung himself at the opening he had clubbed free . Hugh 's gun came down to sight on the fleeing figure  --  and that was when Captain Pokh of the BangkokImperial Troop went into action . The little captain either had ignored or had not understood North 's barked command to cover the alley . Instead , he was right behind the colonel and his heavy revolver blasted in Hugh 's ear as he fired over North 's doubled shoulder . The jarring concussion was enough to knock North 's aim off the fraction of an inch needed to score a complete miss . Hugh had been trying for the gunman 's shoulder  --  a dead man could not explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bullet went smacking into the window frame beside the disappearing gunman . As for Pokh 's shot , it spanged into the ceiling above the window and lowered a curtain of plaster dust . Cursing under his breath , Hugh went for the window , but Pokh was faster . The captain did not have to straighten from a crouch and so he beat North to the opening , hoisted himself to the sill and leaned out , his feet off the floor , to send four more thunderousshots echoing into the dark alley . The colonel knew as well as if he had followed every bullet that Pokh had scored four more misses . North whirled and raced to the door of the squalid little room , ran down the hall to the rear door , and turned a corner into the alley . His man was gone  --  if it had been a man . Instead , there was a burgeoning crowd of natives attracted by the fusillade flowing into the alley from all directions . If the one surprised in Marchet 's room had been a target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target now and Hugh turned back to the hotel entrance , bitter disappointment mounting within him.  |p152He  had had a good chance to grab Wallen 's killer , a man linked to the Bracht case by odds of ten to one , and he had muffed it . No use to blame Captain Pokh for his failure ; if he had approachedMarchet 's room as he should have , on the alert and quietly instead of thumping along like a cop on the beat , chatting with Pokh , he might have grabbed his man and gone on from there to almost any success in guaranteeing Hans Bracht 's security , his safe return to Cape Canaveral . Hotel employees , cooks , waiters , and porters , were jabbering outside Marchet 's door as he came back down the narrow hallway . The colonel rudely pushed his way through the throng and into the room , slamming the door shut on all those peering faces . He found Pokh standing beside the bed , looking down at all that remained of Georges Marchet of Cholon , Vietnam . Even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch , North knew that Marchet was dead . An ugly stain welled and spread from a wound under the Frenchman 's left eye . No man could have survived a shot there . The Siamese captain tore his fascinated stare loose and looked at North , grimacing . " We have two murders now , " he announced . " No murderer . Too bad you missed when you so close . " Hugh bit back his rejoinder and kept his voice level . " Have your men check the whereabouts of everybody in the hotel who was on that Hong Kong plane , " he ordered . " Also see if Chu Hoong is in his penthouse . " " Why you suspect Chu Hoong ? " Pokh wanted to know . " He never murder anybody  --  he do n't have to . He friend of everybody , got no enemies . His medicine is best in world . You tired , Colonel North ? You can not sleep because murderers all about ? Take dose of Dragon 's Tooth Elixir and you sleep good , you eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry , Hallo , hallo , ladies ; tonightI take three-four " No thanks , " Hugh said hastily . " I 'm afraid I 'm past the Dragon 's Tooth Elixir stage . And we 'd better move fast on checkingup on those people  --  there are a lot of them . " " Oh , I go , I go . " He paused and eyed North speculatively . " You say everybody on plane ? You mean Misser Barrows too ? "  |p153The  question jolted North . It had taken a little Thai who sometimesskirted the ridiculous to remind him that he had taken Hans Bracht 's innocence in Wallen 's murder , this killing , for granted . What right did he have to do this ? Then he remembered Pokh 's plain-clothes man on duty on the fourth floor of the Imperial and he heaved an inward sigh of relief . That man ought to be able to account for Bracht 's movements and give Hugh North at least one person who could positivelynot have killed Wallen or Marchet . " Your man can give you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped his fingers at the reminder . " Ho , you can see now why I need expert American help , stupid me , " he said , and with that he was off . North heard him orating at some length to the crowd in the hall outside and while North could not understand the Thai chatter it was fairly reasonable to assume that Pokh was explaining that another foreigner had been killed , murdered in cold blood , and that he , Pilanung Pokh , would see that the killer was brought to justice , never fear . Hugh muttered his exasperation . By the time Pokh got around to checking the whereabouts of any suspects the killer , if it was one of the Hong Kong plane crowd , could have a tub and a shave . Or maybe only a tub ; the killer could have been a woman . North had gotten only a fleeting glimpse of Marchet 's murderer , silhouettedas he or she took a header through the smashed window ; it was impossible to say definitely whether the hand that had held the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was only one reason this poor drug-soaked wretch had been killed ; the dead man had answered that question with his last breath . " C'est le meurtrier de l'acteur ! " he had cried : It is the actor 's murderer ! Marchet had somehow found out who killed John Wallen ; he had ordered his own liquidation by his discovery . A good bet was that Marchet had seen the murderer , either leaving Wallen 's room after the killing or even in the very act of driving home the knife . But why had Marchet been there at that time ? Had he merely been late for the cocktail party or was he connected with the " little business " Wallen had said he had top154finish up ? Marchet had known Hans Bracht in Indochina . Bracht had met Tao Muong in Chainat after he had parted with Marchet . That is , if Bracht had told the truth there . It was , to take a line from a play about a long-gone Siamese king , a puzzlement . The colonel went through the dead man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken window . In the dingy shirt 's breast pocket he found a faded and creased newspaper photograph of Dr. Hans Bracht and his wife . Hugh studied the clipping . Even though the print was smudged by long handling , despite the woman 's stiff attitude , Tao Muong was indisputably a beautiful young woman . And , unless the news photographer was to blame for blanking out all signs of intelligence , only beautiful ; Tao Muong 's eyes , the cast of her mouth displayed plenty of sex appeal even in this foggy photo , but there was no indication of deeper , more substantial qualities . This , then , was the girl who had made one of the world 's greatestminds spend hours reading movie magazines to her  --  how far apart these two people must be , the world 's greatest authority on space travel and a girl who must think movies the most wonderful thing in life . It was in search of that beautiful , vain , shallow face that looked blankly back at Hugh from the worn and soiled clipping that Dr. Hans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States had ever planned , had deserted his laboratoryto place his life in jeopardy . This empty , movie-struck girl had by her kidnaping endangered the future of the free world . Movie-struck girl . In those words must lie the connection betweenTao Muong and John Wallen , the link that had cost Wallen his life . Does the name Tao Muong interest you ? Yet Bracht had said Tao Muong had never met John Wallen . Still , Tao Muong 's voice had sounded over the telephone here in Bangkok ; had Wallen somehow met the missing woman since he had come to this city ? Could Wallen have been one of the gang holding Tao Muong as bait to lure Hans Bracht into their clutches ? Had the actorp155decided to defect , for some reason , and had he been killed before he could spill what he knew ? Possible . Very possible . John Wallenmight not be Hugh 's idea of a Red agent ( Commie operatives seldom made personal enemies any more than they made friends and Wallen was too completely the heel to fit the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no particular brand of undercoverworker . Wallen 's position in the movies could prove valuableto the Reds in many ways . The movies  --  always the movies ! Call the Tiger , Tiger ! company'spresence on the Hong Kong-Bangkok plane a coincidence , but one could not so easily dismiss Wallen 's knowledge and the death it had brought him . The movies were the field of Lex Ross , who admitted that he once had borne the Communist party name of Walter Wells . It was Ross who had recognized Bracht so quickly , Ross who had badgered North , trying to get the G-2 agent to admit he was Bracht 's guard , who had plagued the colonel for some kind of post as " assistant . " It was Ross , another movie star , who boasted that he could disguise himself as any other man alive and thus move about freely in any character that suited his needs in search of information  --  and murder ? There had been no signs of a struggle in Wallen 's room . Did that mean that the actor had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of a friend  --  or that the friend he had trusted was another man , in disguise ? An examination of Marchet 's effects showed the Frenchman had been nearing the end of his rope when the murderer 's bullet had snuffed out his shabby existence . The battered suitcase gave up several letters from friends and relatives in France , all refusing to lend him more money . There was also a stiff letter from a Saigon bank , telling Marchet that unless he came up with a paymentimmediately it would foreclose on the drug addict 's tea holdings.  |p156There  were other pitiful relics of a failure , a photograph of a much younger Georges Marchet , spick and span in pressed white drill and a clean toupee , standing on the veranda of a new plantationhouse ; a Croix de Guerre he must have won in World War I , some tattered obituaries from French newspapers , an I 0 U for a thousand francs , dated March 16 , 1927 , and signed with an illegiblescrawl . There were an opium smoker 's tools , the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by countless pellets of opium that had been kneaded on its side before the bowl was reversed over the lamp 's flame to provide the drafts of smoke . There was a tin of the poppy-seed paste , the estate of the man who had given up his happiness for dreams . There was also a hypodermic needle , a flame-blackened spoon , a pillbox containing several white tablets which were not aspirin . Georges Marchet had graduated from opium to heroin and perhaps the killer 's bullet had been a merciful thing . And last of all was a scrap of hotel stationery upon which was written in a shaky hand : " Suite 7-D . " That was the number of John Wallen 's rooms and Georges Marchet apparently had not trusted to his fuzzy memory to direct him to the scene of his own death . Captain Pokh returned to Room 14 with the announcement that Carss , Lita Naline , Lex Ross , and Boris Salenkov had been checked and had not left their rooms since the police interrogation . " Proves murder was done by other person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Perhaps , " North sighed . He knew it would accomplish nothing to point out that the Imperial Hotel had half a dozen entrancesthat the killer could have used when he or she doubled back , several on halls that did not lead to the lobby . When Pokh had delayed outside this room to orate to the hotel employees the colonel had known that the checks were almost useless ; there had been a faint possibility that the killer could have been caught off home base if the checks were made soon enough , but speed was not Pokh 's forte.  | " I 've got to get back to my room , " the colonel told the undersizedThai . " I 've been away too long , as it is . " " You not going to stay here , take fingerprints ? " Pokh asked . " Thought American police always took fingerprints , found murdererby strange automobile tire mark . " " Not this one , " North said a trifle wearily . " Besides , I 'm interested in these killings only so far as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never tell me what your mission is , " the Thai captain said wistfully . " Why you not tell me ? Perhaps I work better with you if I know what you 're doing . " Hugh considered briefly . The little man might not be G-2 headquarters ' idea of the perfect confidant but he deserved something for his co-operation ; not too much , but enough to keep him from feeling he was on the outside . " Briefly , it 's this , " the colonel told Pokh . " The man in the next room to mine is a person my country wants to keep out of the hands of the Communists . His wife 's been kidnaped and I 'm pretty sure the Reds used her as a lure to get my man out here so they could grab him . " " So-o-o , " Pokh breathed , nodding . " And you think murder of Misser Wallen and Monsieur Marchet mixed up in this somehow , mebbe-so ? " " I do n't know , " North said truthfully , " but just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of my man 's missing wife . " " Can give me name , puss ? " Pokh asked . Hugh hesitated . Was this little captain sufficiently well informedto connect Tao Muong with Dr. Hans Bracht , the spacetravelauthority ? He crossed his fingers mentally and took a chance . " Her name 's Tao Muong , " he told Pokh . " She 's a countrywomanof yours , I believe . Ever hear of her ? " The captain shook his head . North produced the creased newspaperphoto he had taken from Marchet 's body . He folded the slip of paper so that Bracht 's half of the picture was kept from Pokh 's view as well as the cutlines that told who the couple were . " Recognize her ? " he asked the Thai . Pilanung Pokh studied the clipping and heaved a deep sigh.  | " Is most beautiful Siamese lady , but I do not know her , " he mourned . " Not that lucky . She is one who should be in motion movies , that one . Much more beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bahts every time she displays overlargebosom to audience . " He looked more closely at the photograph . " Can have excellentpicture laboratory make copies of this , " he offered . " Place pictures at all stations with lookout order , find her quick if she is in Thailand . " Like Mary Hollberg ? North asked , but silently . " No , " he said aloud . " That would be the proper thing to do but we ca n't operate that way , this time . You see , above all we ca n't let the kidnapers know that we 're tailing my man . He thinks his wife would be killed or disfigured if they get the idea they 're being double-crossed . " " Is large possibility he is right , " Pokh agreed . " I do n't think so . If my theory stands up , they do n't want any ransom money ; they want my man . But we ca n't take that chance . We 've got to play it as a straight kidnaping until we 're sure it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hell with the rules and movein . He put his next question after due deliberation . " Tell me , Captain , what 's your department 's stand on the Communists ? I mean , I know Thailand is neutral ; I know your country is small and has to walk carefully when it comes to being involved in any dispute between the Communist and non-Communist nations , but are your department 's leanings to the right or left ? Just between the two of us , of course . " " To the right , " Pokh said firmly . " Oh , General Genung most fierce hater of Communists . They fool around with General Genung and  --  phttt !  --  they find themselves dead , most times . Whole Bangkok Troop same way . Also national army . We are not neutrals like India , sir ; we tell Vietminh to stay out of Thailand or we shoot them quick . " " Fine , " North said heartily . " One more thing ; Chu Hoong told me he was a very close friend of General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure can Chu Hoong bring to bear through your army if he wants to play rough with me ? " The little captain puzzled over this question and finally hunched his shoulders . " I do not know , " he admitted . " Never has happened , I can think of . But is true General Genung and Chu Hoong very close friends . Like I told you , Chu Hoong is friendof everybody . " " You know it 's Chu Hoong who always gets Aloysius Robinsonout of trouble , do n't you ? " Pokh grinned uneasily . " Had big suspicion but never no proof , " he said . " Chu Hoong never come right out and say this man must not be arrested ; only pay fines , put up bail , things like that . Some say Aloysius Robinson is really Chu Hoong 's son by Macanese woman but do n't know for sure . " He peered at North . " You think because Robinson tried to rob your Misser Barrows that Chu Hoong mixed up in kidnaping , mebbe-so ? You think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trying to kidnap him too ? " " Or kill him , " North said bluntly . " Ohhh n000 , " Pokh protested . " Even if whole world crazy and Chu Hoong is Communist man , he not send Aloysius Robinsonto get Misser Barrows . That ponk not worth a tical at any-thing . " And that , North told himself , was rating Robinson about as low as a Siamese could rate anybody . A tical was the lowest coin in Thai currency , worth , as the saying among American travelers put it , " a ' tckel ' for a nickel . " " There 's one answer to that , " North returned . " Robinson might have been trained all these years to build a reputation for worthlessnessso that when he handled a big job for anybody the generalreaction would be just as you 've explained . " Pokh 's disbelief showed plainly on his round face . " Mebbe-so , " he said politely , " but if true , Aloysius Robinson sure have good time getting trained . Would think rich man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much time and money training Aloysius Robinson to be a  --  a bomb . " " Bomb ? "  | " You know , worthless fellow . Bum , mebbe ? " " I get you . " North smiled . " Now I 've got to check on Barrows . And not a word of what I 've told you to anybody , you under-stand ? " " Mom 's the word , " Pilanung Pokh said fervently , and somehowHugh North believed him . Hans Bracht was awake and roving restlessly about Room 437 when North returned . " What 's going on here ? " the missile genius cried immediately . " When it got to be the middle of the night " ( it was then exactly 9:32 ) " and you did n't come back I got hungry and went downstairs to the dining room . On my way to the elevator I noticed this strange little man come out from behind one of those potted palms . He went down in the elevator with me and he sat across the room from me . I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I left , he left , and he came up on the elevator with me . I finally asked him who he was and what he wanted but he would n't answer me . " " Probably did n't understand you , " Hugh offered . " You forget I spent some time in Siam . I have n't forgotten the language entirely . He understood me , all right . Who was he ? Did you set him on me ? Is he a policeman ? I warned you , North , that if " Now take it easy , " the colonel crackled . " I said I would n't interfere with your ransom payoff or do anything to wreck the deal . That promise still holds . If I have a plain-clothes man put outside the door to make sure somebody other than that kidnap crowd does n't try to liquidate you it does n't break my promise . " " Liquidate me  --  who would do such a thing ? " Bracht scoffed . " I do n't know who , but it 's being done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news when you were down in the dining room ? " " I did n't speak to anybody but my waiter , giving my order , and that little snoop later . News about what ? What are you talking about ? " " Two people were murdered in this hotel this evening , " Northp161said grimly . " Two people you knew , one pretty well . Georges Marchet and John Wallen . " Bracht 's jaw sagged . " You mean  --  you mean they got in some sort of a fight ? " " No , they were killed at separate times , Marchet , I 'm sure , because he saw who killed Wallen and had to be shut up . " The missile scientist looked stunned . " But  --  but why was Wallenkilled ? Have they found the murderer ? When did it happen ? You said you heard that Wallen knew something about Tao Muong . Did his murder have anything to do with that ? " " I suspect it did , " Hugh said . " I 'm not positive . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured two sizable drinks , watered them and handed one to Bracht , took the other to the chair in the corner . " Doctor , " he said matterof-factly , " let 's talk . We may not get another chance , the way things are beginning to move . " " Talk ? Talk about what ? " " About everything . It 's time to stop playing games with me , Doctor , and give me the whole story . Two men have been killed , They 're getting restless , Bracht ; They may jump any minute and when They do I want to be ready for them  --  I want to know what direction They 're coming from . " " I 've told you I ca n't talk , North . I 've explained how They warned me " Let 's get this straight , " the colonel grated . " They did n't kidnapyour wife for ransom money , Dr. Bracht . They want you . They 're Communists and the only deal they 'll offer is to swap Tao Muong for you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At best , They 'll let her live with you in a Soviet prison laboratory while you work for them against the free world . Will you go for a deal like that ? " Bracht 's face was gray , lined . Cling as he might to the hope that he could get Tao Muong back by paying x number of dollars , North knew that the master of space travel must have had the terrible suspicion nudge into his thoughts that this was more than a snatch , that this was a Red plan to make a slave scientist out of him . Still , the missile genius fought to preserve his illusion.  | " They promised me ! Tao Muong told me over the telephone that They would let her go when I paid the ransom . I 've got to believe her , Colonel . " " But you have no way of knowing it was Tao Muong , " North pointed out . " An accented voice is the easiest in the world to imi-tate . " " But I talked to Tao Muong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I had n't recognized her voice I 'd have known that by what she said to me . Those were things only she could possibly have known . She mentioned some things that I 'd almost forgotten  --  things like what she wore the night we met in Chainat , my first words to her , what we ate at our first meal together . Nobody would have known that except Tao Muong . " " This was in Hong Kong ? " North asked . " There and in San Francisco . " Hans Bracht nodded . " Whateverelse I may be wrong about , I 'm right when I say I talked to Tao Muong , no imitator , Colonel . " " All right , " Hugh said reluctantly . " Let 's drop that for the moment . Did Georges Marchet ever know Tao Muong ? " " No , he never saw her . I 'd separated from Marchet when I met Tao Muong . " North brought out the clipping photo and crossed the room to hand it over to Bracht . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down at the slip of paper he held in his faintly quivering hand . The tall , balding man 's eyes moistened as he looked at the photograph and his voice was husky . " That was taken when we reached Seattle , the first time we came to the States , " he explained . " It was published everywhere . At the time there was a great deal of commotion about my reappearance and my seeking American citizenship . I was what I believe is called hot news . " His eyes rose to meet North 's . " Where did you find this ? " " In Marchet 's pocket . " Bracht pursed his lips . " I wonder why he kept it ? " he mused . " Probably to remind himself that once  --  just once in his miserablelife  --  he did a worthy thing . " His stiff , unyielding expression altered a trifle as he looked back at the G-2 colonel . " That soundsp163egocentric , I know , " he apologized , " but Marchet had very little to be proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drugs . . . " He let the sentence trickle into silence . Hugh paused a moment before he said , " You hate drugs and drug addicts with a particular venom , Dr. Bracht . Why ? " The old rigidity came back to the scientist 's face . " Does n't every decent man hate both ? " " The drug traffic , yes , and those who prey on addicts "  --  Hugh nodded  --  " but most more fortunate men feel a certain pity for the addict . I 've noticed you lump everyone connected with the evil and hate them all . I 'm curious to know why . Were you ever addicted to the use of drugs , Doctor ? " The other man 's indignation was immediate and righteous . " Of course not , " he rapped out . " I have more self-discipline than to let myself become the animal that drug addicts get to be . Oh , I know how low a person can sink . Believe me , I know ! " " It was somebody in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bracht grunted . " My early life was hell because of him . He killed my mother as certainly as though he had driven a knife through her heart , he and his crazy need for drugs . I grew up hating him and everything about him  --  most of all the dope that made him a quivering wreck , the drugs that made poor peopleof us Brachts . Oh , it was kept a secret from the world and still is  --  we were a proud family  --  but I swore one day that I would get revenge for what drugs did to me and I have , in small measure oh yes , I have ! " " And yet you depended on a drug addict to lead you through the jungle , out of the reach of the Japs , " North ruminated . " Yes , it was a strange quirk of fate , " Bracht said . " I gave my life over to the hands of one of that tribe I despised , an addict . I even softened to the point where I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , tried to get him to throw off his habit . He  --  he had some good qualities , I admit . He may even have tried to free himself from his curse but it was no use . In the end , when we were out of reach of civilization and his supply of heroin , he smoked hemp , hashish , and became a wild man . He  --  we
