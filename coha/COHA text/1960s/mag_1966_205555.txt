Nowhere was this year 's electoral outcome awaited with greater suspense than in the Midwest , where millions of Republicans deserted their party in 1964 . And nowhere , as it turned out , did the G.O.P. make so vigorous a come back . Republicans not only eradicated their losses of two years ago but also added some upsets of their own , and may well have recovered their historic power base in the nation 's heartland . <P> In addition to the glittering Senate victories of Chuck Percy and Bob Grif fin , the voters re-elected a phalanx of Republican regulars : Iowa 's Jack Miller , Kansas ' James B. Pearson , South Dakota 's Karl Mundt , Nebraska 's Carl Curtis . Indeed , it was a boomerang attempt by Lyndon Johnson to dislodge Curtis that led to one of six gubernatorial victories in the region . <P> Brother Bother . Piqued by Curtis ' criticism of his Administration over the Bobby Baker case , the President persuaded Nebraska 's popular Democratic Governor Frank Morrison-who had been favored to win re-election-to run for Curtis ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support of Nebraska 's conservative businessmen , but the same element had also backed Curtis . Forced to choose between the two , the business community stuck by the Republican . Defeated with Morrison was the Democratic candidate to succeed him , Lieutenant Governor Philip Sorensen . <P> The latter was more hurt than helped by his abrasive older brother Ted . President Kennedy 's former speechwriter , who flew in from the East to campaign for Phil and immediately got into a shouting match with the Omaha World-Herald over some disparaging remarks that Ted had made about progress in his home state in 1961 . In the end , Phil lost the limelight to a G.O.P. novice , Norbert ( " Nobby " ) Tiemann , 42 , himself a Kennedy-handsome , 6-ft. 3-in. banker from Wasau ( pop . 724 ) . An unknown nine months ago , Tiemann stumped the state shaking every outstretched hand , put across his German name with the slogan : " Tiemann . . . Nebraska 's Way to Spell Governor .

Senator Jack Miller , Hughes , an ex-truck driver and reformed alcoholic , easily won re-election over Republican William G. Murray , an Iowa State University economics professor ; nonetheless , Hughes-imposed tax increases cut down his margin of victory . The voters ' revolt over taxes-cum-inflation was also a major issue in Kansas . <P> Conversely , Ohio 's G.O.P. Governor James Rhodes , who was re-elected to a second four-year term by a landslide 700,000 votes over Democratic State Senator Frazier Reams Jr. , was helped by the fact that he had upheld a 1962 campaign promise not to raise taxes . Spending also figured in the gubernatorial campaign in Wisconsin , where Democratic Candidate Patrick J. Lucey , a Kennedy supporter , attacked Republican Incumbent Warren P. Knowles as a profligate squanderer and " cheerleader Governor . " Nonetheless , Knowles , whose accomplishments include ambitious educational reforms and a $300 million anti-pollution program , trounced Lucey by 626,250 votes to 538,797.                 @ @ @ @
