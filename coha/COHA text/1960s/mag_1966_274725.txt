While the rest of the nation celebrates the holidays , the U.S. Post Office yearly undergoes its weeks of winter discontent . This year the Post Office staggered beneath a record 9 billion pieces of holiday mail , an avalanche that subsides only gradually in the last hours of the old year . By diverting $30 million from next spring 's budget , hiring temporary workers earlier than usual and winning a high degree of public cooperation - even the White House used ZIP codes on its Christmas cards - the Post Office managed to get by with only routine delays in most places . Much worse than a couple of weeks of slower deliveries , however , is the very real danger of having a " holiday hell " all year long . The Johnson Administration fears that the ever-growing mail load imposed on an archaic postal system could seriously erode year-round service in a few years unless drastic reforms are made . <P> Chicago Snarls . The Post Office now handles some 80 billion pieces of mail annually , as much as all other countries combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - twice the anticipated rise . As a result , in late September and early October the Post Office suffered some snarls and snafus - particularly in Chicago , the nation 's busiest relay point . Even after that crisis abated , one large direct-mail company reported a ten-day delay in sending third-class mail from Manhattan to Brooklyn . <P> One of the postal system 's worst problems is the obsolescence of its facilities . Few major terminals have been built in the East since World War II . While existing processing centers are often well situated in relation to rail road networks , mail moves increasingly by truck and plane . Automation has swept the industrial world but so far has barely touched the Post Office , where the manual labor of 681,600 employees , now reinforced by 150,000 seasonal workers , still is the prime mover of mail . Opposition from powerful postal unions and from some lethargic officials has slowed innovation . <P> Subject of Ridicule . Less tangible but nonetheless real has been the department 's stepchild status in Washington . Congress looks at the Post Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appointments and construction schedules both remain matters of patronage . Because the Post Office charges the public for service , the chronic P.O. deficit - estimated at $1.2 billion for the current fiscal year - is a subject of congressional ridicule . Yet it is Congress that sets the rates , fixes wages , and writes other regulations that assure losses in most postal operations . <P> The Post Office is also caught in a personnel bind . The generation of workers and supervisors recruited in the hungry ' 30s , when civil services attracted many qualified young men , is now retiring . With a basic starting pay of $5,331 for clerks and letter carriers , the department is having difficulty signing up competent men and even more difficulty keeping them . The P.O. is 20,000 below its roster strength , and turnover has been so high that a quarter of the nonseasonal force has had less than a year 's experience .
