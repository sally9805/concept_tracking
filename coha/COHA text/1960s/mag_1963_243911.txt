The new breed of man who succeeds in business is the executive who knows how to automate and cut costs . Last week Westinghouse Electric , the second biggest U.S. electrical-equipment manufacturer ( after General Electric ) , picked for its president a man who fits that mold so perfectly that he is known as " Mr. Automation . " The new chief is Donald Clemens Burnham , 48 , who makes a fetish of efficiency but also manages to smile at it . He is , besides , an ingenious engineer who is also a supersalesman . <P> Whimsical Junking . Westinghouse directors picked Burnham , who was vice president of the industrial-products group , from among 43 vice presidents to take over from ailing President Mark W. Cresap , 53 . A onetime management consultant who in five years at Westinghouse brought the company from malaise to new health , Cresap 's own health has been bad ever since a bout with hepatitis last year . Recent complications brought doctor 's orders to give up work completely , and last week Cresap underwent surgery at Pittsburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burnham , his successor , is Massachusetts-born and Purdue-educated . <P> He started as an engineer for General Motors , where a former boss remembers him as " an intense young man who moved so fast that his coattails were flying most of the time . " When he was lured to Westinghouse in 1954 , he had risen to assistant chief engineer of the Oldsmobile Division , become an automation expert who was largely credited with stepping up Olds engine production from 30 to 85 an hour . <P> <P> Westinghouse had all the challenges an efficiency expert needed : much of its equipment and many of its methods were obsolete . As vice president in charge of manufacturing , Burnham played the key role in a new automation program , systematically changed Westinghouse from a " job shop " type of operation to the latest assembly-line methods , which saved the company millions . On one occasion he whimsically presented an ancient drill press with a 50-year service ribbon before junking it . When he took over the industrial-products division , he launched a study to determine how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon became one of the company 's most profitable . <P> Who Is He ? A nonsmoker who can nurse a drink or an interesting idea for hours , Burnham wears loose-fitting clothes that give him a rumpled , unpretentious look . He has already shown that he has no intention of changing his ways as Westinghouse 's chief ; right off , he declined the president 's right to a chauffeured Cadillac , preferring to drive his Corvair to work as usual over the five miles from his Mount Lebanon , Pa. , home , where he lives with his wife and four of his five children . <P> His selection surprised almost everyone in Pittsburgh except close associates . The new president of Westinghouse is not even listed in the Pittsburgh Registry of Corporation Executives , and oddly , in view of Burnham 's penchant for automation , the head of the Westinghouse union local had never heard of him .
