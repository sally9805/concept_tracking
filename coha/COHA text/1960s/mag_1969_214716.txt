Anxious to escape abrasive confrontations of the kind that embroiled his two immediate predecessors , Richard Nixon had hoped to avoid direct federal intervention against price increases by private industry . Yet last week the President took strong steps to arrest soaring lumber prices-and there was little grumbling . His tactics much resembled those of the Johnson Administration , which in 1965 fought off aluminum and copper price rises by threatening to release supplies of the metals from Government stockpiles . Nixon ordered the Interior and Agriculture departments to step up the sale of lumber from publicly owned forests , which contain more than half of the nation 's sawtimber supply . To reduce demand , he directed the Defense Department to limit its purchases to " essential requirements . " <P> Wood prices have been highly volatile during the past year . The cost of plywood has risen by 77% . Douglas fir lumber , used mostly in housing , has doubled in price in many localities . Housing 's surprising winter strength has only heightened the price pressure . Last week the Commerce Department reported that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February , well above last year 's total of 1,500,000 . <P> Limiting Exports . Builders blame the price problem not only on heavy domestic demand , but on rising exports to Japan , whose timber purchases in the U.S. have increased twentyfold since 1960 . Last year the Japanese bought enough lumber to erect 40% of the U.S. output of one-family homes . In response to complaints that numerous small lumber mills as well as price stability have been imperiled , Congress last fall sharply limited exports of lumber harvested from federal forests . But prices have continued to rise , partly because of severe winter weather in the Pacific Northwest and the recent East Coast longshoremen 's strike , which cut down the supply of timber from Canada . <P> At the urging of George Romney , the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development , Nixon three weeks ago appointed a task force to recommend remedies . Last week 's action is aimed at increasing timber output from federal lands by about 10% , but the Administration clearly regards that as only a stopgap . Testifying at a Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeopardize the goal of raising residential construction to 2,600,000 units a year under the Housing Act of 1968 . The former auto executive and Michigan Governor criticized Democrat Robert Weaver , his predecessor at HUD , for failing to develop programs to meet that objective . Complained Romney : " I have inherited a department that is essentially in the same condition as American Motors when I took over . It was losing money . Our department is losing ground .
