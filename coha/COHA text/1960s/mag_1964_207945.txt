A thousand years ago , India was the land of Vatsyayana 's Kama Sutra , the classic volume that so thoroughly detailed the art of love that its translators still usually leave several key words in Sanskrit . Last week , in a land that has become so straitly laced that its movie heroines must burst into song rather than be kissed , five scruffy young poets were hauled into Calcutta 's dreary Bankshall Court for publishing works that would have melted even Vatsyayana 's pen . The Hungry Generation had arrived . <P> Born in 1962 , with an inspirational assist from visiting U.S. Beatnik Allen Ginsberg , Calcutta 's Hungry Generation is a growing band of young Bengalis with tigers in their tanks . Somewhat unoriginally they insist that only in immediate physical pleasure do they find any meaning in life , and they blame modern society for their emptiness . On cheaply printed paper , they pour forth a torrent of starkly explicit erotic writings , most of them based on their own exploits ( " In the Taj Mahal with My Sister " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Hungry Poet Shaileshwar Ghose , 26 , a schoolteacher . " I say what I feel . I feel frustration , hunger for love , hunger for food . " <P> Three Widows . To all appearances , their appetites are unlimited . In a short story , Bank Clerk Malay Roychowdhury , 25 , tells of a starving poet who first devours his fiance , then his poetry notebook , then a building and Calcutta 's huge Howrah Bridge . A poem by Schoolteacher Ghose crows that " I impregnated three widows at a time , and now I am lying in bed happy . What next ? " <P> Absurd as they seem , the hungries see themselves as the spokesmen of a betrayed and miserable people . " Our frustration is not just personal , " says a 28-year-old geology lecturer . " It comes from the strains , the poverty , the squalor of our society . " And in a series of violent manifestoes , the hungries singled out their enemies , including hypocrites , conventional writers and politicians whose place in society lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a donkey 's tail . " To " let loose a creative furor , " the hungries last summer sent every leading Calcutta citizen-from police commissioner to wealthy spinsters-engraved , four-letter-worded invitations for a topless bathing suit contest . <P> Done-for World . With that , the entire Calcutta establishment rose up in rage . Newspaper editorials , quoting passages from their works , proved conclusively that they were dangerous and dirty-so much so that Calcutta 's reading public began to look for them . Under civic pressure , the police hauled away 26 of the " poets " for questioning . Five were suspended from their jobs and booked on charges of obscene writing and conspiracy against society . <P> The evidence for last week 's trial was irrefutable , but meanwhile the Indian government had been approached by sympathetic intellectuals at home and abroad . Looking for a face-saving exit , the Calcutta prosecutor temporized , requested a postponement in court . To celebrate their temporary freedom , the hungering beats raided an art gallery , beat up three painters , then walked happily away to resume their pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the done-for world and start afresh from chaos .
