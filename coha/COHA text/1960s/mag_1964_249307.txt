He was not an inventive tinkerer like Henry Ford or a master mechanic like Walter Chrysler ; yet he had a more profound effect on the development of the U.S. auto industry than either of them . No auto bears his name , though he made possible the variety of names and styles that mark today 's auto industry . He is still spoken of with awe and respect in Detroit , where he performed one of the business miracles of the century : the transformation of a haphazard and inefficient collection of automakers into the world 's largest and most profitable industrial enterprise . <P> At 88 , Alfred P. Sloan , the former chief executive of General Motors and its guiding light for 33 years before he retired in 1956 , no longer wields the vast executive power he once exerted . But he still keeps busy as a member of G.M. 's finance committee-and he still knows more about the intricate science of running a large corporation than any other living American. * He has now committed much of that knowledge to paper with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Motors , published last week after five years of preparation , is nothing less than a modern Pentateuch of management technique that has revelations for every executive-and everyone who aspires to be an executive . <P> In Control . After graduating from M.I.T. in 1895 , Sloan parlayed a $5,000 grubstake into control of a small New Jersey roller-bearing plant . In 1916 William Durant , the flamboyant founder of General Motors , bought out Sloan , who became a G.M. executive . Only four years later , when Durant was forced out for speculating in G.M. shares , Sloan had shown such a flair for organization that the new Du Pont management made him executive vice president . In 1923 he became president . <P> From the time the Du Ponts took over , Sloan and G.M. were inseparable . He took hold of the seemingly unmanageable collection of divisions , some of which hid their cash from the others , and shook hard ; he brought order out of chaos , and thus geared the company for a growth that hardly anyone else foresaw . He instituted G.M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " emphasized selling autos on the installment plan , and set up G.M. 's first efficient auto-dealer system . <P> Leveling on Ford . After shaping up G.M. , Sloan in the mid- ' 20s leveled his sights on his bitter and then bigger rival , Ford . Old Henry Ford 's policy was to stick with one model , in one color , in one price bracket-forever , if possible . Sloan countered with a strategy of change and diversity that aimed at the auto buyers ' varying tastes and pocketbooks and their desire for change . He broadened G.M. 's line by creating the medium-priced Pontiac and by extending Chevrolet further into the low-priced field . He then inaugurated the most unbeatable auto-selling gimmick of them all : the annual model changeover . It quickly became a key factor in spurring the growth of the market .
