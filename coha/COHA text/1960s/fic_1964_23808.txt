Fast Dan A story by William Price Fox School was out for the summer and Earl Edge and Bo Hunnicut , aged fifteen , were sitting in the back booth at the drugstore drinking Pepsi Colas and reading the Columbia , South Carolina , Record . Earl was reading the Help Wanted ads for summer jobs . " Here 's something , Bo . Carpenter helpers , no experience , dollar an hour , Colonial Heights .. . That 's good money . How about it ? " Bo finished the last of his Pepsi and began picking at the wet label . " That 's the place Jethro worked . " " Doing what ? " " He was n't doing no carpenter helping . They had him on straight labor . Hundred-pound kegs of nails . That 's what they had him on . Carried them all day . Have n't you seen him lately ? " " No . " " Man , he looks terrible . " Earl held his finger on the ad and shook his head . " Whew . .. Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything had to be moved by hand . And when the mud dried he had to carry the kegs up from a storage basement . He 's lucky to be alive . " Earl slid his finger down the column . " Here 's grill work . Five Points , does n't say who it is . " " Anything about hours ? " " No . Nothing . " " That 's Brown 's place . He never mentions the hours until he hires you . He wants you there from noon till two in the morning and if you 're tired enough he 'll let you sleep on the dirty linen . " " Fourteen hours a day , that 's against the law . " " For grill help ? Hell , Jack Stevens works fourteen every day . You ever heard of a union for grill cooks ? " " Do n't get so excited . I only read you the ad . I did n't say anything about going down to see him . " Bo opened the paper and smiled , " Looka here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Palmetto . That 's for me . That 's what I want to do . How much money you got ? " " Thirty-five cents . " " Any at home ? " " No ... You ? " " Not a nickel . You feel like getting some bottles up ? " Earl folded the paper and slid it up under the jukebox station at the side of the booth . " Let 's ride . " 80 FAST DAN They left the drugstore , climbed on their bikes , and went to Bo 's house . They picked up two hundred-pound croker sacks and dropped them in their bike baskets and headed uptown . At the Silver Dipper Pool Room they found fifteen pint bottles and eleven half-pints in the garbage and in the men 's washroom . At Gayden Brothers they picked up thirty more in the dark alley behind the bowling alley . They stopped again at the Busy Bee , the Spot , and the American Bar and Grill . Within two hours their sacks were filled and they headed back toward the Bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest corn-whiskey outlets in Columbia and he paid two cents for unwashed pint bottles and one cent for half-pints . Claude used his own bottle caps . Earl and Bo collected two dollars and ten cents for the two bags of bottles and headed home to wash and dress for the movie . It was dark by the time they met at the drugstore and began the long ride up Elmwood to Main and down Main to the theatre . As they rode along Earl said , " Listen , we 're getting too old to be making money like this . What if some gal from class sees us tipping around the Silver Dipper alley with those damn sacks slung over our backs ? What are we going to say ? " Bo sat back on the edge of his seat . They were coasting down the last block of Elmwood to Main . " Never thought of that . It would n't be too good . I 'd really hate for Mary Alice to see me coming out of an alley like that . Boy we must really be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bo said , " Okay , Earl , tomorrow no more bottles . I do n't care how much we need the money . No more bottles . " They pumped hard to get up speed for the short hill up Main to Laurel Street . The lights of Main Street and the city lay out before them and in the summer night , which would with luck drop to eighty degrees , the tall cascade of white and blue lights of the movie house looked like Niagara Falls . They caught the green light at Laurel and ducking their heads , to cut the wind resistance down , they pedaled as fast as they could toward John Wayne and the great air-conditioned plant of the Palmetto Theatre . In the morning they were sitting on the curb near the drugstore in the block of shade cast by the mailbox when Dan Driggers drove up . Dan was a tall , slow-moving colored fellow . Someone had said when he was younger he had played baseball and had caught for Satchel Paige . But now he was almost fifty and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dan 's Chrysler was his pride and joy . He kept it in perfect condition and it was always freshly waxed and clean . Every time ho got out of the car he 'd pull a soft chamois cloth out of his back pocket and buff and polish the chrome work of the radiator and the grille . And when the wind came up from the west he 'd cuss , wet his fingertips and pick off the fine lint blown over from the cotton mill . No one was allowed to lean on Dan Drigger 's Chrysler . Dan eased the car to the curb , taking care he did n't soil the freshly whitened white-wall tires , and pulled the brake on . He grinned out the window at Earl and Bo . " You boys come on in . I got some news . " They climbed in the back seat and stretched out . Dan always kept funny books in the back seat for Earl and Bo to read to him . Earl slumped down away from the burning sun . " You want me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No reading today . I got some news . How you boys like a nice ice-cold Pepsi and a bag of potato chips ? " Earl said quickly , " Fine , Dan . That would be fine . " Dan went inside the drugstore and returned with three Pepsis and three bags of Wise 's Potato Chips . He handed the drinks and chips over the seat and sat down under the steering wheel . " Now I 'm going to tell you what I 've gone and done . " Bo leaned forward . " You quit your job ? " Dan grinned and nodded . Earl sat up . " You mean you 're out of work ? What are you going to do ? " A faint smile tickled along Dan 's mouth and he took a deep drink out of his Pepsi . Earl said , " What kind of job you going to get , Dan ? There 's not much call for ex-sheet-metal men around Columbia . You planning on staying in Columbia , are n't you ? " " Shore I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I aim to die here . But I kind of figured you boys were sort of experts on getting jobs . I mean what with all that reading the ads all the time . Maybe you could find something for your old buddy Dan . You know , something kind of interesting . Something different . " William Price Fox left high school in Columbia , South Carolina  --  the setting of this story and of his story collection , " Southern Fried " ? and joined the Air Corps , where he became a bombardier-navigator . He graduated from the University of South Carolina in 1950 and is now working in New York . His second book , " Doctor Golf , " came out last summer . Earl said , " I 'll go inside and get the classified and we 'll go through them . " Bo swallowed a handful of potato chips and said , " Wait a minute . I know where there is a job . I tried to get it last week but they want someone older . " Dan looked at him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They want a rack boy at the Silver Dipper . Boy , I 'd give my eyeteeth for a job like that . Not much to do and play all the pool you want . Now that 's what I call a real job . " Dan shook his head , " No man , I want me an outside job . Ai n't healthy being around all that drinking and shouting and smoking all day . Besides , what I know about racking balls ? " Dan smiled and reached back and patted Bo 's shoulder . " Listen , I already made up my mind about what I 'm going to do . I just wanted to see what you boys were going to come up with . But you got to admit going from a sheet-metal shop to a rack job in a low-class place like the Silver Dipper do n't make much sense . " Bo sat back and picked up a funny book . " I was just trying to help . " " I know you were boy and I appreciate it . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going in . I 've decided to go into the transportation business . " Earl said , " You going to haul whiskey ? " " Man no . " " What ? " " People . Men and women and children and dogs and livestock if they can pay the fare . I 'm going into the cab business . " " No lie ? " " No lie . . . I got me a good car , Right or wrong ? " a story by William Price Fox 81 " Right . " " I 'm a good driver . Right or wrong ? " " Right . " " Well , that 's all you need and I 'm opening up a cab company . " " When ? " Dan finished his Pepsi and bounced the bottle out onto the hard clay between the curb and the sidewalk . " First thing in the morning . " 0 n the next day Dan arrived at the drugstore with the Chrysler converted into a cab . It looked good . He 'd gotten a painter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black area in big , white , good-looking letters " Fast Dan . " Along the trim below the window in half-inch lettering he had printed " Owner , Proprietor and Operator  --  Dan Driggers . . . " and then brackets enclosing his new name , " Fast Dan . . . " Earl said , " Where 'd you get that name ? " Dan straightened his new short-billed motorcycle hat , " It came to me in the middle of the night . Like it ? " " I guess so . " And so Dan Driggers went into business . He had no license , no meter , no uniform , and no rates ... only a motorcycle cap , two blacked windows in his Chrysler , and his brand-new name , " Fast Dan . " A passenger , drunk or sober , would get in at the drugstore . " How much to Irmo ? " Irmo is fifteen miles from Columbia and twelve of the miles are over dirt roads . Dan would say , " Where in Irmo ? " " Al 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time and pretend to be doing a complicated mathematical problem behind his eyes . The passenger would say , All right , how much ? " 82 FAST DAN Dan would say , " I do n't rightly know . I suspect whatever you think it 's worth . " " Let 's say three dollars . " " That sounds fine for there and back . But I 'll have to have a little something extra if I have to wait around all night to bring you back . " And Dan drove slow and careful and everything worked out fine . Only one trouble  --  the minute Dan would get his hands on two dollars or five dollars he 'd be up at Gus Spode 's Texaco station on Main Street buying new stuff for the Chrysler . New lights , new rings , new brakes , new chrome , new everything . Three out of every four dollars that Dan made went to Gus Spode 's but it was n't too long before the Chrysler looked and drove like a combination Rolls-Royce and Pierce Arrow . Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earl and Bo kept his books in a Blue Ribbon tablet . They kept track of the miles he drove and the gas he used and the money he collected and the money he spent at Spode 's . Every Saturday Dan would buy a half of a case of Pepsi-Colas and a box of sandwiches and potato chips and they would go out to the Blue Hole Rock Quarry . There they would swim and lie around in the sun and eat the food and drink the Pepsis . The Saturday picnic was their fee for doing the bookkeeping and advising Dan to quit spending so much money on the car . But it did n't do any good . Dan had to have new fog lights , Dan had to have a new grille , a new radiator , and he had seen a sterling silver winged figure of an angel with trailing flags and leaping deer for the radiator that he said he had to have or he would die . On Friday Dan gave Earl and Bo a letter from his sister . He said she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He figured she was in some kind of trouble . She was . The letter had been hand printed on a piece of brown wrapping paper . It read : Dear Dan , How are you . I is in terrible trouble . I need $67.50 at once . My address is Thelma Driggers , 6011/2 Fortune Alley , Charlotte , North Carolina . Your loving sister , Thelma P.S. If you ai n't got the $67.50 , $25.00 will be fine . Earl handed him back the letter . " What 's wrong ? " " She need another bortion . " " What 's a bortion ? " " Well , it 's a kind of like a ring job or a valve job on a straight-eight engine only it 's more serious . " " That 's too bad . " Dan shook his head . " Tell me something  --  how much is forty-two fifty from that figure you just read me ? " " Forty-two fifty from sixty-seven fifty is twenty-five dollars . " " Man they shore do get prices for them up there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise twenty-five dollars ? " Earl said , " But she said she needs sixty-seven fifty . " " She always does that . Thelma always adds the month 's rent on . " Later Earl and Bo asked Doc Daniels what a good price for a " bortion " was . There was a woman standing at the fountain and when Doe looked up from the gallon of chocolate syrup he was pouring into the dispenser Earl thought he was going to throw the jar right at them . When the woman left and Doc settled down and Earl told him that the bortion was for Dan 's sister , Doc scratched his head and said a first-class one should run right around three hundred dollars . Bo said , " Do n't they have any cheaper ones than that ? " Doc said , " Weil , there are ways of cutting corners but it would be hard getting much below three hundred dollars . " Bo said , " Well we know of one that 's going for twenty-five . " Doc whistled and picked up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me any more about it and forget you even mentioned it to me . Okay ? " " Okay , Doc , whatever you say . " Dan went on a short haul and came back . He looked worried . " Where am I going to raise that kind of money ? " Bo said , " You want to haul some whiskey for Claude Johnson ? We can get twenty-five dollars out of him . " " No man , I ai n't going to haul no whiskey in my Chrysler . If I lose my Chrysler I am through . The law would catch me in a minute , shoot my car full of holes , and where would I be ? I tell you where I 'd be , I 'd be wiped out . That 's where I 'd be . " Earl and Bo could think of nothing else except collecting over two thousand bottles which was impossible . Suddenly Dan snapped his fingers . " I got it . Small loans , that 's where I 'll go . Up there on Assembly Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? .11 by William Price Fox 83 They 're up there someplace . All we got to do is find them . Let 's get in the car and I 'll drive and you bays read the signs , we 're bound to run into them . " Bo said , " Wait a second . I 'll go check the yellow pages . " The Friendly Kredit Co. were friendly enough . They agreed that a twenty-five-dollar loan could be arranged in ten minutes and that even if Dan could n't sign his name his mark would be fine They drew up the papers . Everything was set until they explained that Dan would have to use his car for collateral . They then explained what collateral meant . Dan shook his head , " No sir . " They explained what collateral meant again . " No sir , I ai n't signing no paper mentioning anything about my Chrysler . " They tried again and finally Earl and Bo tried . " No sir . . . no sir . . I appreciate it and I know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They went back to the drugstore . Earl tried to read Dan a Batman and Robin funny book but he was too restless and worried to sit still . He got out of the car and began polishing the grille and the radiator , and going over the windows . He was moving too fast and Earl could tell he was very tense . As the sun set behind the magnolias of the Logan Elementary School yard , Dan came inside and sat under the wheel . Finally he spoke . He spoke toward the window . " How much whiskey Mr. Johnson want hauled ? " Bo said , " Fifty gallons up and fifty gallons back . " Earl said , " Why is that ? " " He needs some aged stuff for blending and it 's up in Camden . " Dan said in a strangled voice , " How 's it packed ? " Bo said , " Kegs . " Earl said , " How come you know so much ? " " He 's my uncle , is n't he ? Besides I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke until he can get this delivery in . " " Well , why ca n't he deliver it himself ? " " His cars are all hot . " Dan sighed lowly . " They watching his house ? " Bo said , " No . " It was dark in the car when Earl heard a small thudding sound from Dan . He looked over the seat . Dan was biting the top of the steering wheel . Earl whispered , " Let 's haul it , Dan . Me and Bo will be along . We can drive out Taylor and get on those back roads . I know every inch of those roads . We can rake it before midnight . " " Boy , I been praying youall would come along . I just do n't seem to have any choice . Okay , we 'll haul it . But I want one thing understood  --  if the law starts after us I want you boys to promise me you 'll jump and hide out in the woods . If youall will agree to that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribs . " You got my promise , Dan . I 'll jump . How about you , Earl ? " " Me too , Dan . I 'll jump . " Dan turned around smiling . " Let 's get going . " After the sun had set and the alleys were in darkness , Dan drove his car to the rear of Claude Johnson 's place for the pickup . The unaged whiskey was packed in five ten-gallon wooden kegs . Each keg weighed about forty pounds and the size was perfect for the big trunk on the Chrysler . Claude gave Bo the keys to the storehouse and told him to place them in a tomato can by the door when they left . They loaded the five kegs into the trunk and started off . They knew the tail end of the car had dropped down with the two hundred pounds but it was n't until they were out on Harden Street heading for Taylor that they realized the springs had collapsed . The car was squatting down on the chassis and every small bump they touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taking a had beating and Dan pulled over under a dark lane of trees . They got out and looked at the rear of the car . It looked like it did n't have any rear wheels . Dan shook his head , " Now that wo n't do , That wo n't do at all . " Bo said , " Let 's put a couple of kegs up on the front seat . That ought to balance her . " They took three kegs out of the trunk and put them on the front seat floorboards . Earl and Bo crowded around the kegs and sat on the front seat . They went out Taylor to Greene over to Reade and then out the back roads all the thirty-seven miles to Camden . They arrived at Claude 's storehouse at ten o'clock and unloaded the five kegs . The whiskey was stored in the back of the store . Dan saw it first . " Oh Lord , look at that . We are through . " The fifty gallons for the return trip was n't stored in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel . There was no way to carry it without the Chrysler 's rear end dragging the ground . The barrel was too big to get through the door of the car and put it on the front seat . Dan looked around the warehouse for Mason jars or five-gallon tins or anything he could use to spread the weight out , but there was nothing . Dan sat up on a loading platform with his head in his hands . " I knew that trip up here was going too good . I knew it . " Bo got a piece of rope and measured the barrel and took the rope out to the car . He returned shaking his head . " It wo n't fit anywhere but in the trunk . And it just will fit there . We 'll have to leave the trunk lid up and lash it down . " Dan moaned . " Oh man , that 's all the law has to see is that back end dragging and the edge of that barrel sticking out . We ai n't got a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform and went over to the car . " Listen , why do n't I go call Claude . Maybe he 's got some suggestions . " Bo called back to Dan , " Dan , listen , we 're going down and call up Claude . See what he says . " Dan did n't answer . They started for the street . Suddenly Bo snapped his fingers . " Wait a minute . Wait a minute . We ca n't call Claude , they got his phone tapped . All they have to hear is that he 's expecting a Load in tonight and we 're in real trouble . " They stood still in the dark gazing at the white lights and the red neon of an all-night caf ? on the outskirts of Camden . They returned to Dan and sat with him on the platform . The giant barrel loomed like a glacier on the floor before them . Earl said , " We might as well try and carry a piano as that thing . " They were quiet for a while . Fertilizer had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sharp yellow smell was still heavy in the air . A dog barked in the distance . Finally Dan spoke , " Them were pretty good back roads there . I think I 'm all for trying it . " Bo said , " I 'm for forgetting it . We 'll go hack and make Claude pay us half of the money . We 'll get the rest tomorrow someplace . " Dan said , " Someplace , like where ? " Earl said , " Do n't worry , Dan . We 'll figure something out . " Dan shook his head , " Naw , that ai n't no good . If he do n't get his whiskey we do n't get our money . What 's fair is fair and we made an agreement . " Bo spoke . " Let 's at least see how it looks in the trunk . " After Earl backed the car up they laid two pieces of timber from the floor to the car trunk and began rolling the barrel up the skid . The barrel weighed almost three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bo pushed the sides . Slowly it settled into the trunk . Dan pulled the timbers out , " Now let 's see how she looks . " He tried to close the trunk lid . It came down one foot and stopped . The lid stuck up from the car on a thirty-degree angle . Dan groaned , " Oh Lord  --  that 's bad . You can tell what it is even in the dark . " Bo pulled the heavy rope out of the back seat and began lashing the trunk lid down as tight as it would go . It came down another inch but no more . Earl said , " How about the springs ? " Dan took a flashlight and slid under the car . He whistled . " Gone . It 's squatting right on the frame . Might as well not have any springs . " Even in the dark of the storehouse they could tell that the Chrysler 's rear end would be dragging the ground and every policeman , preacher , and Boy Scout would know what they were hauling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's thirty-seven miles from Camden to Columbia and a good car with no strain can get there in thirty minutes ; but the roads that Earl directed Dan over cut through the swamp and ran along the edge of the Congaree River , and the journey from the outskirts of Camden to Spider Hill that overlooks the city took three hours and fifteen minutes . The rear end kept wanting to fishtail with all the weight concentrated in the trunk . Added to that , when they went up a hill or down a hill the exhaust pipe and the gas tank would scrape along the roadbed . At the top of Spider Hill Dan collapsed over the steering wheel . " Man , I am a nervous wreck . " Without thinking , Bo blurted out , " If you think you 're nervous now just wait till we get on Richland Street . " But Dan was too tired to hear and the message did n't register . Earl heard it and a pair of cold claws began kneading his stomach . Claude 's place was on Richland Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill . They started down the hill and Bo spoke . There was a shrill nervous quality in his voice , as if he had been keeping a terrible secret from them . " You 'll have that money in no time now , Dan . Maybe a little bonus for all this extra risk . " Dan said , " All I want right now is to get rid of that whiskey . Nothing else . " The road was clay with washed ruts and the car began to chatter . Dan spoke again , " When does he want me to flash my lights ? " Bo said , " Stop at Gadsden Street . Just hit them once and then leave them off . If he flashes once it 's okay . If he flashes three times turn off and keep going . " " What does that mean ? " " Means the law is waiting . " " Oh Lord , do n't tell me that . Where am I going to drive ? Why did n't you tell me he was being watched . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight to the police station right now . " Bo 's face firmed . " It 's going to be all right , Dan . I know it is . " Earl did n't speak . He felt warm sweat drenching him under his arms and across his chest . At Gadsden Street Bo said , " Flash the lights , Dan . Flash them . " " You flash them . My hands ' so slick I can hardly hold the wheel . " Bo reached over and turned the lights off and then back on . They slowed down and waited . And then Claude 's lights went off and then on . They were safe . The law was n't around . Claude Johnson had flashed his lights only once and everything was all right . The sweat had cooled on Earl 's chest and arms and he began to relax . Claude 's place was less than two blocks away . They passed under a street lamp and he saw a faint grim smile on Dan 's face . Earl squeezed Bo around the shoulders . Aa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go now . Earl could see Claude smoking his pipe on the porch . One block to go and Earl was dying to let out a Rebel Yell . He held it back until they were fifty yards from Wayne Street . He cupped his hand over his mouth and let out a soft yell that felt great . it was a beautiful noise and Bo joined in at the end . They did it again . This time it sounded like two beagle hounds coming home after being away a long , long time . Dan murmured a pleasant sound and they all three joined in the final rising , sweet yell . The beautiful noise was interrupted by a siren . " All right , pull over . " A wet pulsing panic seized Earl , Bo grew rigid , and Dan , after he had stopped the car , flopped forward on the steering wheel as if he had been hit with a post-hole digger . The officer 's flashlight stung in and counted the faces . There was no need for him to look any further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunk and taste the whiskey , for all of the misery and panic and guilt were shining out from the grim faces . " All right , what are you carrying ? " Bo 's voice skittered up , " Scrap iron . " " Let 's have a look . " The officer pushed down his kick stand on the motorcycle and dismounted . The light appeared in the rear window and Earl heard him tap the flashlight on the full barrel of Kershaw County Corn Whiskey . The officer returned . " Well , well , well . and you a cab driver . " " Yessir . " " Fast Dan Cab Co . I supose you have a license for that too , have n't you ? " " No sir . " " Give me your driver 's license . " " No sir . " " No sir , what ? " " No sir . I do n't have none . " The officer took a leather notebook out of the saddlebag . " Where 's this whiskey going ? " No one spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Captain , you know I ca n't tell you that . " The officer looked down the street at Claude 's . " Well , it does n't take any Sherlock Holmes to figure that one out . " He came around to the other side of the car and opened the door . " All right , you boys come out here . I want some information . " Earl and Bo got out . " Names ? Addresses ? Parents ? School ? " He filled out a long complaint form . " Which one of you know Claude Johnson ? " Earl said , " We both do . " " I guess I do n't have to tell you you 're in serious trouble ? " " No sir . " He looked at Bo . " You Claude 's nephew ? " " Yessir . " " Want to say anything for the record ? " He had his book on the fender . He handed the flashlight to Earl . " Here , hold this . " Bo started talking slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told the officer everything . About Dan 's cab , about the records in the Blue Ribbon tablet , about Dan 's sister , Thelma , the small loans , the unaged whiskey , the big fifty-five-gallon Coca-Cola barrel , the ride back from Camden , Spider Hill , everything . . . . The officer was- silent for a while . Dan kept leaning on the steering wheel trying to believe it was all a bad , bad dream . The officer led them away from the car . " Dan 's sister is Thelma Driggers ? " Earl said , " Yessir . " The officer seemed to be smiling , " Well , how about that ? I 'll tell you something . Thelma Driggers used to cook for us , practically raised my kids while I was off in the Navy . Where is she now ? " " Up in Charlotte .

" The words " how close " rang in Earl 's ears . Tears welled in his eyes and the small white lightsfrom the colored houses along Richland Street looked green and red and gold . " I 'm not going to take you boys in . I 'm going to tear up these complaints . " The gold lights turned silver and then back to gold and beautiful music came from some place in the top of the tall loblolly pines that lined the street . " All right , now get back in that car . Tell Claude I 'll leave him alone for a few days but no more . Understand ? " " We understand . " Dan was paralyzed . Bo pushed him over in the seat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill . He flashed his lights once and Claude returned the signal by flashing as fast as he could . He had seen the police officer . When they got to the driveway Claude came running down the steps and into the yard . " Get that stuff out of here . For Christ 's sake , Dan , are you nut of your mind ? " Bo leaned out the window and told him part of the story . Dan did n't speak or move . He just sat there like he 'd had his backbone removed . After the whiskey had been unloaded , Bo and Earl got the money from Claude and sent the money order to Thelma . Dan acted limp all that night and all the next day . Finally they made him drink down a couple of Atlantic Ales but he still would n't talk . Ile just sat out there on the front bumper of his Chrysler and drank and smiled and every now and then he 'd shake his head . Then he 'd pause a while and drink some more , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the mockingbird that usually hung around the drugstore had arrived and was making a sound like a torn cat when Dan slowly arose from the bumper and , taking his chamois cloth , he smiled and began stroking softly , softly stroking the radiator , the hood , the fenders and the chrome trim of his beautiful 1939 Deluxe Chrysler .
