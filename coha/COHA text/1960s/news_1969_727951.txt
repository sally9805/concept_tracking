txt Mitchell vs . Finch . Burns vs . Moynihan . Laird vs . Rogers . Dirksen vs . Scott . President Dixon launched a daring experi , . ment in what he called " an open White House " when he permitted his chief officials and advisers to differ publicly among themselves : ? This experiment now is facing its first crisis . The President has made a number of decisions touching strongly held views and positions of the political left and right . The debate between his top officials has sharpened . The President has appeared to move toward the right , and sometimes back toward the left . Critics are charging the administration with indecision , with protracting confusion unnecessarily , and with moving away from whichever position the critic happens to hold . Behind the " open White House " plan , Mr. Nixon held a larger concept , stated in his inaugural address : that Americans should " learn from one another . . . stop shouting at one another . ? . speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could lead a low-key , middle-of-the-road administration , avoiding " inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver and angry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds . " Government , he said , " will listen . " For . a while this worked . Only the ABM dispute showed signs of escalating into real ideological trouble . Mr. Nixon seemed to be letting both the liberal and conservative forces within his government and in the country have their say while he maneuvered slowly toward decisions that would give something to both sides but that would take a generally moderate line . Issues boil Then in the fifth month of his term patience started to run thin , and issues began to boil like those of changing the Voting Rights Act , modifying the school-desegregation guidelines , closing - tax loopholes that aid the wealthy , enlarging the federal health services , extending East-West trade , and the like . The nonpartisan Congressional Quarterly announced that " only three of Mr. Nixon 's requests had been enacted " by Congress on July 4 , compared with 11 of President Eisenhower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Nixon technique of move slowly , make careful decisions , give something ' to both ideological camps , but hold generally to the middle and keep the temperature down was jolted .

Defense Hugh Scott Everett McKinley Dirksen Liberal vs. conservative *Nixon s open ' plan jolted // ancing act of the , great prestidigitator , Richard M. Nixon , is ended .. It was an impressive act while it lasted , confusing both friends on the right and doubters on the left . " The Democratic Senate Majority Leader , Mike Mansfield . of Montana , said that " care , caution , and competence " had marked the opening months of the Nixon administration , but that now Mr. Nixon has become the victim of " infighting , quibbling , and disruption " within the Republican Party , and that the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate Republican whip , Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania , said he did not believe that the Republican liberals in Congress were in open rebellion yet , but added , " I 'm simply serving notice . Period . " The high noise level was mostly on the left . Mr. Nixon and his advisers sat tight for the most part . They quietly told newsmen that the President was a moderate and not a right-winger and that his aim . was one of ideological balance . " Watch our actions , " they said . " These will tell you where we stand . " Meanwhile , the most sturdy argument on the President 's side was voiced by 1,551 American citizens , carefully selected for their ability to represent the general public . They were interviewed on their doorsteps by the Gallup Poll in the four days ending June 23 . The percentage approving " the way Mr. Nixon is handling his job " was 63 percent  --  a figure which began as 59 percent in January and has fluctuated between 61 and 65 percent since then . ( Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's withdrawal of 25,000 American troops from Vietnam . ) The left was not yet in full cry when the Gallup Poll was taken , but the rift was opening up . Questions raised These developments , and a clutch of others like them , have raised serious questions whether Mr. Nixon 's procedure for calming the " fever of words " what " America has suffered from " is accomplishing its purpose : Does an " open White House " debate between the President 's top officials and a slow shakedown process in adjusting their disputes serve to calm the domestic ' scene or exacerbate* it ? WoUld a policy of swift , incisive decisions from the Presi dent himself , supported by an enforced silence below him , make for more stability ? Would it satisfy the political left which is now on the warpath ? Would it work , as it did not work for President Johnson ? The liberal Washington Post argues from its viewpoint that " five months of internecine manglings and countermanglings " have produced " an inconclusive teeter-totter position " on issues like civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues of this sort " can be solved by equivocation , more delay or on the cheap . " Debates continue But this argument is part of the liberal attack . On the Nixon side is privately . expressed . hope that " actions " will convince the general public that in practice the administration is establishing a fair balance between left and right , when it comes to actually administering the policies that are now under hot ideological debate . Most observes here think he has some time yet to find out whether this is the case or whether the flames will spread . Meanwhile ' Attorney General John N. Mitchell will continue to debate with Robert H. Finch , Secretary of Health , Education , and Welfare , on the speed of desegregation in Southern schools . Presidential economic adviser Arthur F. Burns will speak for a restricted welfare program while Daniel F. Moynihan , Secretary of the Urban Affairs Council , advocates a general one based on family income maintenance . Defense Secretary Melvin R. Laird will press for the ABM and the military view of foreign policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceleration of military involvement abroad and the primacy of political policy . And Senate Minority Leader Everett McKinley Dirksen will take the hard conservative line on questions like desegregation and the enlargement of federal health services , while his minority whip , Senator Scott , threatens to jump ship if this continues . There is no sign yet that the President intends to close out a series of debates designed to give him political credit in both ideological camps ? and especially in the contested political center .
