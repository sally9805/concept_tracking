Notes and Comment WE arrived home well after dark an the evening of last week 's first snowstorm . Snow had fallen thickly and silently all through the afternoon , cooling the city 's long fever of Christmas buying , softening the patient 's harsh mutterings . Buses mashed along the uptown avenues , throwing up rich waves of slush and exhaust fumes , and the storefronts of neighborhood delicatessens and dry-cleaning establishments cast cherry-bright designs on the white sidewalks . As we turned into our street , one shoe full of freezing snow and our shoulders aching with the final armload of packages , we discovered a party of gravediggers at work directly in front of our brownstone walkup . Three men stood in the classic attitude of their calling , heads down and shovels at rest , watching a fourth , who was wielding a pick ; the fissured laver of snow on their caps and shoulders looked like old sheep 's wool . The man at work had already carved out a neat black rectangle next to the curh . As we approached , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprang up from the frozen concrete , and his accompanying " Huh ! " came out in a little cloud of vapor . We decided that it was unlikely that a grave was being dug right at our doorstep , but other unpleasant possibilities suggested themselves . A congealed water pipe ? A leaking gas main ? A major construction site ? We stopped beside the workmen and asked , " What 's the trouble ? " The pickman straightened up , and the three other men looked at us tolerantly . " No trouble , " one of them said . " No trmihle at all . " The group exchanged smiles . " Well , what is going on ! " we inquired . " We 're planting a tree , " said the man with the pick . " Nothing to worry about . " He jerked his head in the direction of a nearby truck , and then we saw that it had a tree lying in the back . It was horizontal , fast asleep in its burlap swaddlings . " You 're working awfully late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believing in this municipal miracle . " Anti it 's a funny time for tree-planting . " " This is our last job today , " said one . " We plant trees for the City  --  all over town . We got slowed up by the weather . We 'll be going home after this one . " Late that night , we were awakened by a party of revellers in the street . They were singing the " Marseillaise , " Faking the words of the hard middle part . We got out of bed and stuck our head out the window . The snow had stopped , and the white roofs of parked cars below looked like a small range of mountain foothills . The singers turned the corner and disappeared , and an immense , listening silence descended . It was broken by a slow clopping of hoofs , and two mounted policemen came up the block , headed home to the Armory . The policemen talked in low voices , and the horses blew great puffs of vapor into the cold night air . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was upright now , planted , and neatly trussed with wire cables to two sentry stakes . It was n't much of a tree  --  a thin cluster of upraised fingers , more stripling than sapling . We could n't even venture an identification ; it was just another city tree . But it was unquestionably ours , and its narrow branches , frosted with a skin of ice that reflected gleams from the street lamp across the way , held within them the promise of a benevolent change , the brush of dusty green leaves in the heat of a city summer . We went back to bed and fell asleep thinking about the year to come . Tire Cat Show NE pre-Christmas night , in order ON to get out of the cold , we stopped in at the New York Trade Show Building and went to a cat show . Cardboard signs in the lobby directed us to the second floor , where hundreds of cats had been brought for display and competition by the Atlantic Cat Club , the Knickerbocker Cat Club , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cat Fanciers Federation . According to the catalogue , whose cover was decorated with a drawing of a deranged-looking white cat sticking its head through a holly wreath , all cats were eligible for some sort of competition unless they happened to be sick or pregnant . Opposite the elevators on the second floor were two tables , one covered with plates of aging cat food and the other with sandwiches and coffee for sale , at modest prices , to exhibitors and visitors . A woman standing in the entrance to the exhibit hall was telling a friend that she had made the dress she was wearing , which had a pattern of cats ' heads around the hern . Inside the hall , we noticed a cat 's cage lined with the same material . We wandered up and down the aisles , past cages filled with sturdy cats of various colors , shapes , and lengths of hair , and decorated with ribbons and rosettes awarded to the inmates for combinations of virtues that included correct eye shape and proper size and bone structure . Cats in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalogue informed us , while the tails of ? Abyssinians ought to he " fairly long " and " unusually thick at the base .

All the cats except those with particularly nasty or voluptuous expressions looked good to us . Some of them were labelled as being apt to bite and others as being for sale ; most of them , like their owners , or fanciers , seemed exhausted by the show , which was in its second , and final , day . Members of the C.F.F. , mostly women dressed in dilapidated smocks and skirts or slacks , were sitting dazedly in front of their cats ' cages , or pacing restlessly as they waited for their numbers to be called for the final rounds of competition .

The Canaday Affair OUR attention has been called to a letter that appeared recently in the Times : TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In John Canaday 's account of the Museum of Modern Art 's acquisition of Matisse 's " Dance " he states that the picture was painted as a study for the version of the same subject commissioned by the Russian collector Serge I. Shchukin , an error unfortunately picked up by the headline writer . Actually , the Shchukin picture was commissioned after Shchukin saw the version now at the Museum of klodern Art . Hence the museum 's new acquisition may have become a study for the later version but was not painted as one , as in fact the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may he a fine point , but when I write mystery novels , I write more carefully than that . MATTHEW HEAD . John Canaday is the art critic and art-news editor of the Times , and he and Matthew Head , we have just been told , are one and the same . This intramural joke was revealed to us by a devotee of mystery novels , who said , " Canada ) ; has written seven murder mysteries under the nom de plume of Matthew Head , and I 've read every one of them . They 're well written and psychologically interesting  --  whyd units rather than whodunits . The first one was ' The Smell of Money , ' in which a young art professor takes a summer job as a kind of painter-in-residence , teacher of painting , and extra man at a rich woman 's place in the country . It has two murders . " We immediately went over to see Air . Canada ) , in the newsroom of the Tones , and he confirmed the juke . " I wrote The Smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art at the University of Virginia , " he said . " I 'd been painting for several years , but I 'd decided to retire as a painter , and I had just held a campus sale of my work at which I charged the cost of my materials plus a wage of thirty-five cents an hour . This came to a dollar up . Everything was sold mostly to the faculty . I felt tin-der a necessity to direct my creative impulses elsewhere , and I thought of murder novels as a vehicle . I had never read any mysteries , so my wife and I proceeded to read fifty in a row . I was n't satisfied with them ; they did n't tell enough about the two chief characters  --  the murderer and the murderee . The murderee was generally killed off so early in the game that you did n't get to know him , and the convention demanding that the identity of the murderer he concealed meant that you really did n't know him , either . In The Smell of Money , ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third over , and the second murder takes place at the end . I wrote the whole hook in three weeks , working from eight at night until three or four in the morning , and sent it to Simon &; Schuster . They accepted it , as an Inner Sanctum mystery , and suggested additions that took me four days more . They told me it was the second hook they had ever published that had been sent in cold . I did n't want to sign it with my own name , because I did n't know whether it would he a success , and if it was n't a success I did n't want my name on it . I thought if it was n't a success the university authorities might take a dim view of it . Also , I wanted to save my own name for writing about art , which I began doing later . I picked the name Matthew Head because I once knew a beautiful girl called Beverly Head and because I thought the combination of Matthew and Head looked faintly sinister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us that " The Smell of Money " sold seven thousand copies in the trade edition and was succeeded by six more Inner Sanctum mysteries ? " The Devil in the Bush " ( 1945 ) , " The Accomplice " ( 1947 ) , " The Cabinda Affair " ( 1949 ) , " The Congo Venus " ( 1950 ) , " Another Man 's Life " ( 1953 ) , and " Murderat the Flea Club " ( 1955 ) , " They 've earned me from two thousand to five thousand dollars apiece , " he said . " One has been translated into French , two have been published in England , and they 've gone into paperbacks here and in England , Australia , Mexico , and the Argentine . Avon is now reprinting them all , in a series . They 're largely autobiographical , except for the murders . ' The Smell of Money ' is based on a couple of summers I spent in the early nineteen-thirties  --  I was just out of the Yale School of Fine Arts  --  teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hada house on her es-tan : all to myself . I changed the scene to San Francisco and made the hero a Harvard man . Three of the others , with Congo settings , are based on nine months I spent in the Belgian Congo in 1943 on a Board of Economic Warfare mission to procure strategic commodities . I subsequently joined the Marines , but that bore no literary fruit ; the experience was too impersonal . They were all great fun to w rite . " We asked Mr. C. why he had abandoned Mr. H. after 1955 , and he replied that he 'd been too busy with other things . " Around 1952 , when I was head of the school of art of Newcomb College , at Tulane University , the late Francis Henry Taylor , then director of the Metropolitan Museum , came down to New Orleans on a lecture tour , and T piloted him around , " he said . " ' I know you , ' Taylor kept saying , although we 'd never met before . It turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Matthew Head , on the jacket of ' The Cabinda Affair . ' Well , a few years later , when I was chief of the Division of Education of the Philadelphia Museum of Art , and the Met wanted someone to write some bro chures on art  --  the Museum called them Miniatures  --  Taylor said to Marshall Davidson , who was then its editor of publications and is now the managing editor of Horizon Books , ' I forget his real name , but there 's a mystery writer who used to he at Tulane and calls himself Matthew Head who might do one . ' " Mr. Davidson followed up this suggestion , with the result that Taylor , ironically , murdered Matthew Head . Canaday turned out four Miniatures and went on to write a twenty-four-part series of portfolios called Metropolitan Seminars in Art , which was published by the Metropolitan Museum and distributed by the Book-of-the-Month Club ; over two hundred and fifty thousand subscriptions to the Seminars have been sold , grossing more than ten million dollars . ( Their author was paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve and a thousand dollars for the second twelve , and he receives a diminutive royalty . ) In 1959 , Canaday joined the Times as art critic , having been recommended for the post by , among others , James J. Rorimer , Taylor 's successor at the Met . " The Thnes takes up most of my time , and while here I 've also published three hooks on art history and art criticism , which pay better than mystery novels , " Canaday said . " The advance on the last one , ' Keys to Art , ' enabled me and my wife to go to Egypt last March . The market seems to absorb any number of hooks on art . I 'm now working on a fourth . " We asked Mr. Canada whether his epistolary joke had attracted much extramural notice , and he said , " It attracted a furious letter from a man in Philadelphia who happened to know that Head was Canaday . He said it was punk humor .

Under the aegis of the school 's Joint Program for Technical Education , they meet on Saturday mornings for long , lusty confrontations with concepts and hypotheses usually reserved for older , calmer brains , and anyone who has ever been set right on the subject of relativity by a smug offspring or been corrected on an astrophysical assumption by an amused nephew will no doubt appreciate the way we felt at the prospect of a session with these particularly alarming sprites . Harry Milgrom , the man in charge of elementary science education for the New York City school system , presides over the Science I experiment for Columbia , and it was at his suggestion that we finally decided to brave a class in static electricity a couple of Saturdays ago . Arriving uptown at ten , we were met by Mr. Milgrom  --  a trim , graying Long Islander wearing a green plaid jacket and that look of slightly harassed benignity common to educators of the very young  --  at the door of his classroom , the **30;2665;TOOLONG lab . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , " Milgrom observed , leading the way past a giant dynamometer , around a combustion chamber , and into a corner of the laboratory , where his charges  --  fifteen boys and three girls  --  were sitting at a long , low table , nimbly producing electrical charges through various ingenious juxtapositions of torn tissue paper , strips of acetate , aluminum pie plates , and plastic spoons . " The picture of these kids discovering the whys of electrical charge by working their own way through problems , using the most basic , familiar household objects as their scientific tools , just about sums up the idea behind this class , " said Mr. Milgrom , who has been teaching and administering science for nearly thirty years . " Every youngster here gets treated as a highly competent student  --  old enough to cope with science and scientific techniques , and , most important , old enough to have a great deal of faith in his ability to think . " He paused to shake hands with Richard Plaut , Jr. , the director of freshman admissions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hello . Mr. Plaut , a tall young man in a dark-gray suit , told us that , as an assistant director of the Joint Program for Technical Education ( " Joint with anybody who wants to be joint with us " ) , he had interviewed and selected all the students for Science I , which is now in its second year . " I asked them ' Why does an astronaut stay in orbit ? ' " he went on . " I was n't looking for the right answer , needless to say . I just wanted to see how they approached and tackled the problem of thinking something through . " He smiled , and added , " The girls were no trouble , but whenever I sent a notice of admission to a boy , I enclosed a pledge to come to class faithfully and resist any temptation to stay home and play ball . One youngster wrote back saying he could n't promise that . He asked that his application be withdrawn . " We wondered what had become of the first Science I class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steam-turbine experimenter and down to the far end of the laboratory , where we encountered the old boys from Science I  --  men of ten and eleven now  --  poring intently over a table piled with seeds .. " Science II , " Plaut said , with pride . " They 're on botany now , studying with David Dragoon , a colleague of Mr. Milgrom 's from the Board of Ed . This week is lima beans , I think . " We waved a greeting to Mr. Dra-goon , who was drawing bean-gene charts on a blackboard , and made our way back to Science I. A wiry ten-year-old , wearing chinos , a surpassingly col-legiate Shetland sweater , and a name tag that proclaimed him to be Gabriel War-ren , remarked nonchalantly that if we cared to join him , he would give us the poop on static electricity . We sat down next to Gabriel , who had taped his plastic spoon to the edge of his pie plate to form a handle , and was now rubbing his strip of acetate with the hack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding up the pie plate by its new handle . He carefully laid the charged acetate on top of the pie plate , touched the plate with a finger , just as carefully removed the acetate , and then guided the pie plate slowly toward his nose . We heard a sharp crackle . " That was electricity . Everything 's got it , " Gabriel explained He stopped to jot down this in-sight in a large Columbia University notebook , under the meticulously hand-printed heading " An Investigation of Static Electricity . " Then , having charged the acetate with his hand again , he held it over his hair , which rose on end . " Electricity , " he repeated , with emphasis . " Say , Gahe , did that first thing give you a shock on the nose ? " a young man whose name tag read " Michael Flamm " inquired . " Sure it did , " replied Gahe , as modestly as was possible under the circumstances . " Well , then , I 'm going to give some shock to my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She does n't know a darn thing about electricity . " Mr. Milgrom , meanwhile , was walking around the table and chatting with each scientist in turn about his particular findings . Jonathan Baum , a merry , bite-size young man in cowboy clothes , announced that he had just ascertained beyond any doubt that electricity flows . Milgrom called the class to attention to hear Jonathan 's report , and Jonathan informed them that he had charged one side of his acetate strip and then had stuck it to the pie plate by its other side . " Can you beat that ? " Jonathan concluded . Milgrom moved on to Kevin Sanders , who was busy waving a piece of charged acetate over his head . " Hey , you can feel the hair being lifted ! " Kevin shrieked . He then grabbed his neighbor , who was a girl and had considerably more hair than most members of the class , and repeated the experiment on her . " Yes , I can feel it lift , too , " the girl solemnly reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and afterward argued several rather reckless theories of electric wind until class broke for cookies and juice . " Notice how the kids do all their own experimenting , " Milgrom said , passing us a cup of orange juice . " They discover concepts , and test concepts , this way They 're living through the experience of science ; they 're involving themselves deeply in what they learn . That 's how great educational impact occurs  --  by figuring your way through an experiment , not by watching it as if it were some sort of magic trick . " " Say , Mr. Milgrom , " said Gabriel , who had returned to his seat with a fistful of Fig Newtons . " My acetate wo n't charge any more . " " Well , Gahe , what do you suppose caused that ? " Mr. Milgrom asked . " Sweat ? " Gahe ventured . " Naw , dirt , " Michael said . " Now , gentlemen , why do n't you test each hypothesis until you find the answer ?
