Elliott Roosevelt , 54 , wants to be mayor too , but of Miami Beach . <P> He announced his candidacy last week while posing in front of a portrait of his famed father , and he is engagingly frank about the political appeal of his family name . " Let 's not kid ourselves , " he says . " It 's very important . " Presently a management and investment consultant , Roosevelt has lived in Miami Beach for only two years , and does not even pretend to know anything about municipal problems . Says he of his contest against Incumbent Mayor Melvin Richard : " It 's a popularity contest , in a sense . The issues are n't as important as the man . " <P> An Interesting Comparison . Richard , 53 , disagrees . " You can bet it will not be a popularity contest , " he says . " He 'll have to stand up and be counted on every issue . And I want to know-I want the people of Miami Beach to know-everything about him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his military record against mine , his domestic record , his children , his business activity . I 'm going to compare everything in his life to my life . Mr. Roosevelt is not going to get away with generalizations . " <P> That might be an interesting comparison . A native of New York City , Richard received a law degree from the University of Florida , joined the Navy as a lieutenant j.g . After the war he returned to Miami Beach to become a vigorous anti-crime crusader . In 1949 , he won a seat on the Miami Beach city council , served a total of four terms , was elected mayor in 1963 . He has been married to the same wife for 24 years . <P> Confident of Victory . Roosevelt , on the other hand , has never held public office ( last spring , however , he was elected Democratic state committeeman ) . Just before World War II the President 's son went overnight from civilian to captain in the Army Air Corps Reserve , causing an outbreak of " I Want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war flying photo-reconnaissance missions . During his remarkably checkered business career , he has been a news commentator in Minneapolis , a Christmas-tree grower in New York , a rancher in Colorado , and a businessman in Havana . He is now married to wife No. 5 , Phoenix Socialite Patricia Whitehead , whom he wed in 1960. * <P> Still , Elliott is confident of victory and has only one worry : the mayor 's meager salary . " I could n't possibly support my family on $3,000 a year , " he says . Why , then , is he interested in the job ? " I want to play a part in the development of my city . " <P> <P> *The others : Elizabeth Browning Donner , daughter of Pennsylvania Steel Co . Chairman William Henry Donner , 1932-33 ; Ruth Josephine Googins of Fort Worth , 1933-44 ; Actress Faye Emerson , 1944-50 ; and California Oil Heiress Minnewa Bell Ross , 1951-60.
