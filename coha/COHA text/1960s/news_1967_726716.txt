txt Some businessmen who flocked to attractive " industrial parks on Long Island to escape the congestion and high rents of the city are now wondering if the move was worth it . A labor shortage that is aggravated by the lack of housing near the industrial parks and by poor transportation has forced the heads of some companies to run their plants below capacity and to cut back expansion plans substantially . " I would like to double my production , but I ca n't find the 150 workers to do it , " said Lawrence Rheingold , president of Templet Industries . Mr. Rheingold moved his company from the city and into an industrial park in Plainview three years ago . He wanted to expand and increase the efficiency of his company , but many of his machines stand idle . A " help wanted " sign hangs outside his modern sheet metal plant in which jobs are avail- able with hourly wages ranging from $1.50 for trainees to $3.50 for skilled workers . Fifteen miles away , in the community of Roosevelt , Jim Edmonson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pointed to a file that contained the names of 100 people looking for work . In New York City , the jobs and the workers could be brought together by a 20-cent subway or bus ride , or a worker could probably find housing near his job . On Long Island , however , restrictive zoning by the towns and the lack of convenient low-cost mass transportation have left many plants isolated from areas in Nassau County that have a surplus of labor . New York City officials often point to these problems as some of the unanticipated hazards of moving a business from the city to the suburbs . The most common reason given for moving is the need for space , of which the suburbs have more than the city . But a number of companies have run into the manpower problem , and such other problems as diminished close contact with accustomed suppliers and customers and with colleagues in the same business .

" Reluctant to Rezone Exclusive ' residential communities that gladly rezoned land to be developed for industrial parks are ' now reluctant to take a further step and rezone land for the construction of apartment buildings . The problem , " according to Franklin Bear , chairman of the Nassau County Planning Commission , is that " the communities want ' all the benefits of industry , but are not willing to provide housing or transportation for the workers to get to their place of employment cheaply and easily . " There were two incentive 's that led communities that otherwise would have opposed an influx of industry to attract it instead . Arthur Kunz , a planning coordinator for the Nassau-Suffolk Regional Planning Board , said ; " Ten to 15 years ago , industry was considered second class .

Plainview , he said , had to construct 13 schools in 15 years , and tax revenue from industry , which does not add to the single biggest expense of any suburban community ? the education of children , was the . ' only way to keep taxes train spiraling . The same communities are now opposed to zoning land for apartment buildings because this would lead to another influx of families and put pressure on the school systems . Seymour Stillman , a planning consultant who has drawn up a master plan for the development of the Town of Oyster Bay for the next 20 years , has recommended that apartment buildings be constructed in areas near industry . He expects strong opposition , however , from local school boards . " There 's a kind of panic when apartment buildings are proposed , " he said . He predicted that even his modest proposal of building 1,000 units of middle- and high-incomes , apartment buildings in the town would be difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly enforce local zoning ordinances that have prevented groups of workers from renting houses near their jobs . The Town of Oyster Bay recently won a suit in the State Supreme Court that barred eight representatives of a Japanese corn- , pany from living in two houses in Syosset that were each zoned for occupation by a family . Joseph . Curry , the director of the Long Island office of the State Labor Department ; said , " The result has been that you have industry concentrated in the central ? core of the island with workers looking for ' jobs tucked away in the corners . " Traveling Costs Are High Mrs. Sonia Kornreich , the senior economist of the department , estimated that there were about 50,000 jobs available and 36,000 unemployed people in Nassau and Suffolk . Most of the jobs are in the industrial parks , she said , where some employers " have stopped calling our office in despair and hung out ' help wanted ' signs .

Many workers feel it is unprofitable for them to take trainee jobs at the parks , where the average wages are $1.50 to $1.75 an hour , because of the cost and time of traveling . Two-Hour Trip A worker , without a car , from one of these areas can expect a trip of up to two hours to get to the nearest industrial park . The trip would cost more than $2 and would involve transfers to different buses . Rudolph James , who has been looking for work through the Roosevelt Economic Opportunity Council for four months , said in a recent interview that he was willing to accept a job paying $1.50 an hour , but would have to spend about $15 a week in bus fare . " After taxes this leafes you with about $35 a week , " he added . " You ca n't support a family on that " An experiment has been under way since last May to see if a low-cost bus shuttle would encourage unemployed persons to take jobs at the industrial parks .

For the first month , the buses often carried two or three passengers each , but on a recent ride a bus contained 28 people . Most of the riders , about half of whom were Negroes or Puerto Ricans , said the bus service enabled them to get jobs . William Tirrell , the supervisor of the project , said ' that he was encouraged by a recent survey . It showed that 792 people used the bus in one week compared to 683 for the previous week .
