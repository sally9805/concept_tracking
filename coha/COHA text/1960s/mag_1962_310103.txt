No normal man could freeze to death without first feeling the cold . None could fry without feeling the heat . But burning and freezing are ancient dangers , and nature has had plenty of time to evolve defenses . X rays and gamma rays are a subtler peril . Until recently , they were unimportant hazards in the human environment ; evolution largely ignored them . Modern man can wander unheeding into strong radiation that he can not feel , see , hear , smell or taste . And unless he carries an artificial radiation sense ( a Geiger counter , ionization chamber , etc. ) , he may get a fatal dose without a suspicion of an alarm . <P> Radiation hazards are multiplying fast today , but Psychologist Edward L. Hunt of the U.S. Naval Radiological Defense Laboratory in San Francisco thinks that nature has not exhausted her defensive resources . He is sure that some higher animals-perhaps even man-have a latent radiation sense that might be trained to warn them against Atomic Age hazards . <P> Blue Flash . Scientists have known for decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detect X rays and gamma rays as a yellow-green glow . This sensation apparently comes from direct action of the rays on minute light-sensitive cells in the eye 's retina , but it has almost no value as a practical warning sense . When the eye is not darkadapted , and it hardly ever is , the retina is sensitive only to massive doses of radiation from such disasters as runaway nuclear reactors . On these unhappy occasions , the victim sees a vivid blue flash , and by that time certain death is only short hours away . <P> No other perception of radiation is known in humans , but eight years ago , Hunt and his associates , Donald J. Kimeldorf and John Garcia , found that rats will shun sweetened water , one of their favorite liquids , if they are dosed with radiation while they try to drink . This hardly proved that rats can sense radiation directly . Quite possibly they had been made slightly sick , associated their malaise with the sweetened water . But the hint seemed worth following . <P> After other encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rats to sleep most of the time . This was not hard to do . If laboratory rats are put singly in small , comfortable pens and given plenty of food , water and light , they soon go to sleep . Ordinary noise does not usually wake them , and they do not mind wearing electrodes for measuring their heart action . <P> X Alarm Clock . When Hunt and crew had a rat sleeping peacefully , they recorded its heartbeats on an electrocardiograph ( 300-350 beats per min . ) . Then they squirted it with a beam of silent , invisible , 250,000-volt X rays . In about 12 sec. , the rat woke up , sometimes going into a violent " state of alarm . " Its heartbeat would speed up too . But if the radiation continued for long , the rat would go to sleep again , like a human grown accustomed to a steady night-time sound . <P> The scientists ran the experiment twelve times with different groups of rats . All were wakened within seconds by radiation too weak to hurt them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiation as humans do with dark-adapted eyes , the scientists simply cut out some of the rats ' eyes . But the surgically blinded rats woke up even faster than the others , as if their sensitivity had sharpened like the hearing and touch of a blinded man .
