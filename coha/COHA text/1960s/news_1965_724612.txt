txt Black Star Braceros A crisis confronts California farmers . Congress has banned importation of Mexican farm hands  --  a move calculated to help domestic laborers . But not enough local pickers are coming forward . The braceros ( Spanish for strong  --  armed men ' ) still are needed , say the fruit and vegetable growers . Related story : Page 3 . By Harlan Trott Staff correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor San Francisco The cry " bring back the braceros " is drowning out the other voices of spring in California . Gov . Edmund G. Brown is making himself heard above the rest . He says he is wondering if Congress acted too abruptly in halting the seasonal entry of Mexican nationals ( braceros ) to work on California farms . Repeal of Public Law 78 was meant to afford farm jobs for domestic workers . Some labor unions were for it , but not the Teamsters Union . So were the National Council of Churches of Christ in America and the National Catholic Rural Life Conference . So was Governor Brown . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if farmers paid wages on a par with other industries . Growers in this farm state say they are ready any time to farm-wage rates in other states , But they insist they ca n't pay more than competing farm areas offer . In the 60 days since the bars went up against the braceros , California 's $3 billion farm economy has been rocked by disputes . The growers insist they are facing serious trouble . The California Labor Federation replies the farmers are " crying wolf . " Tomatoes cut back A cannery near Modesto , Calif. , announced it was shutting down its tomato lines due to the uncertain picture . Last year the plant processed 40,000 tons of tomatoes . The state AFL-CIO termed the announcement " poppycock . " Thomas J. Pitts , state labor leader asserts the growers are trying to " sabotage " the government 's policy favoring farm jobs for domestic workers . Observers are wondering if the Modesto tomato cannery 's dropout is a portent of things to come in general . Since 1961 , they point out , a half-dozen giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mexico . At any rate , Governor Brown has swung over to the farmers . He has asked Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz to consider importing braceros " in substantial numbers and in the very near future " to head off possible crop loss in the state 's leading industry . Secretary Wirtz is believed to have been feeling his way through the last two months . He wants to be sure that backers of the bracero ban can rustle up the domestic labor supply they contend is on hand . But can he risk testing the home-labor market much longer ? Bank-loan tune This is the time of year when banks normally make loans to launch the growers ' season . Right now the tomato industry is all at sea . " Tomato growers should be planting right now , " says manager Bob Holt of the Cali- fornia Tomato Growers Association . " Until this labor scare is ironed out , three-fourth of our growers are left stranded . Banks just are n't willing to lend our people the funds they need to start planting . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can harvest . " This is the fix that three-fourths of the state 's tomato growers are said to be in . The other one-fourth are those who plant , till , and pick by machinery . Mr. Holt cites this machine segment as a portent of a long-range solution to the farm-labor crisis . In the end , machines will plant , tend , and pick the crops . The tomato growers are waiting on the bankers . The bankers are said to be waiting on Secretary Wirtz . If he certifies growers can import braceros when and where they are needed , the bangers ' risk will be resolved . Mr. Wirtz has promised there will be no crop losses in 1965 if he can help it . The growers say this is a safe statement  --  if no crop gets planted . Growers are not seeking reenactment of Public Law 78 . This is the 1951 law letting in braceros . Growers feel existing laws are good enough .                   @ @
