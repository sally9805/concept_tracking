Things were not going at all well for Ray Floyd . At the finish of the 16th hole , his game seemed to be coming apart . The five-stroke lead he had held at the start of the day was down to one . He had bogeyed the 15th by missing an 8-ft. putt , and now he faced a 35-ft. downhill curler that could easily be the first of three putts . The hole , he said , " looked two miles away . " Among the 12,000 onlopkers was South Africa 's Gary Player , Floyd 's playing partner and closest competitor , ready to take advantage of any slip . Floyd did not clutch . He calmly arranged his pudgy form over the ball and stroked it into the cup for a birdie . Admiringly , Player walked toward him and extended a congratulatory hand . The gesture was Player 's tacit admission that , two holes away from the finish , Floyd had as much as won the 1969 Professional Golfers ' Association title . <P> It was ironic that Floyd had cinched matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangup through all four rounds at the National Cash Register golf course at Dayton . He took a total of 121 strokes on the greens-six more than Player , five more than Bert Greene , who finished third , and eleven more than fourth place Jimmy Wright . Floyd really won the P.G.A . with his booming , if sometimes errant drives , and with his beautifully wrought iron play . He hit 59 greens in par , compared with Player 's 53 . There was another ingredient in Floyd 's winning eight-under-par score of 276 : self-assurance . " I feel superb , " he said midway through the tournament . " I just do n't see how I can shoot over par . " After the match , he admitted : " Confidence is the key to my game . I would have no business being out there if I were not good . " <P> The Other Shoe . Gary Player , who has a reputation for being equally sure of himself , lost much of his aplomb at the P.G.A . He was the target of third-round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dayton Chamber of Commerce might better have applied its energies to the city 's ghetto problems than to sponsoring the P.G.A . tournament . <P> At one point , a program was tossed at Player 's feet as he was about to drive . When he walked to the tenth tee , someone threw a cup of Coke and ice in his face . Player turned to his tormentor and asked , " What have I done to you , sir ? " A small group of dissidents rushed the tenth green as Player and Jack Nicklaus were preparing to putt . The interlopers were quickly hustled off . " The man who threw the Coke called me a racist , " Player later complained . " Just because you 're from South Africa , it does n't mean you 're a racist . " After the tournament , Player admitted that all through the final round he had been nervously waiting for more trouble . " It was like waiting for the other shoe to drop . " It never did .
