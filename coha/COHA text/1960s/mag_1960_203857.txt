By its policy of granting independence upon request , France hoped to keep the friendship of the 13 new states that until this year comprised the French empire in western Africa . As its staunchest ally in the area , France counted on Felix Houphouet-Boigny , 55 , the sly old pro who sat in five French Cabinets and is now Premier of the Ivory Coast . Last week Houphouet-Boigny assembled five Presidents , three Premiers and three ministers plenipotentiary* for a conference in the Ivory Coast 's boomtown capital of Abidjan , and emerged just 48 hours later to announce " unanimous agreement " on foreign policy questions . <P> Limited Area . The statement sound ed more expansive than was the actuality ; the delegates ' area of agreement was limited to Algeria and the Congo . Houphouet-Boigny swore the delegates to secrecy until he could fly off to Paris to press the results on his good friend Charles de Gaulle . But the gist of the policy leaked . Houphouet-Boigny will urge De Gaulle to soften his terms for an Algerian ceasefire . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of France on Algeria , but will support a U.N.-supervised referendum to determine Algeria 's future . De Gaulle has rejected the U.N . referendum in the past , but even he should recognize that Houphouet-Boigny had gone as far toward support of France as any popular leader in Africa could afford to . <P> On the Congo , the prevailing voice was that of President Fulbert Youlou , the cassocked , nonpracticing priest who runs the old French Congo . Living just across the river from Lopoldville , and a fellow Bakongo tribesman of Congo President Joseph Kasavubu , Youlou rallied the other delegates to a stand that urged the U.N . to cooperate with Kasavubu. said nothing at all about Kasavubu 's archrival , Patrice Lumumba . <P> Strong Voice . A French-educated tribal chieftain with a Tammany sachem 's flair for politics , Houphouet-Boigny became a member of the French Assembly in 1945 , joined forces with the Communists , but broke with them in 1950 . He eventually parlayed his role as an African spokesman into a three-year succession of Cabinet posts in Paris , beginning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from France an ambitious aid program ( $16.5 million this year ) . As a result , Abidjan is completely electrified and may be the only city in Africa where every dwelling has running water . <P> Houphouet-Boigny runs his piece of Africa through the African Democratic Rally ( R.D.A. ) . Guinea 's Skou Tour once led a powerful opposition of the left within the party , but Tour opted Guinea out of the French Community and into relative quarantine . Houphouet-Boigny men from the R.D.A. now rule in the French Congo , Niger , and Upper Volta , and his voice is strong in the other states that joined in last week 's conference .
