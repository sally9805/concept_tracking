Like Little Black Sambo 's tigers whirling around the palm tree , the Democratic candidates chased each other madly through the primaries last week , generated most of the political motion , and produced most of the headlines . In the face of such furious activity , Republicans felt a certain uneasiness . In Vice President Richard Nixon , they knew , they had a strong and battle-tried candidate , but was the G.O.P. losing political advantages , marking time ? The latest Gallup poll showed Nixon trailing Democratic Front Runner John Kennedy 47% to 53%-putting Kennedy a poll ahead of Nixon for the first time since Nixon 's trip to Moscow last summer. * <P> Sensing the doubts , Dick Nixon set out last week to dispel them with a pledge of a dynamic , hard-hitting campaign that is already in the works . " Anyone who does not recognize that we are in for the fight of our lives must be smoking opium , " he told a huge Republican rally in Lincoln , Neb . " I believe we will win , but we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought campaigns in America 's political history . " <P> In launching his campaign , Nixon said , " We will be proud to run on our record . But we must not stop there . A record is something to build on , not to stand on . Standpat , hold-the-line thinking is not enough to meet the great challenges confronting the American people at home and abroad . " <P> Green Light . One of Nixon 's most vexing problems has been to find a tactful way to avoid being a prisoner of the Administration 's record . On the heels of his Lincoln declaration , Nixon got a welcome green light from the White House . " He would be absolutely stupid , " President Eisenhower told his press conference last week , " if he said that you were going as far as the record of this Administration would carry you and then stop . " Added Ike : " If he does n't say that he is going to build on what has been so far accomplished , I think he would be very foolish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board of directors of the National Federation of Republican Women , came a second White House endorsement . Said Presidential Press Secretary James Hagerty : " Personally , I sincerely believe that the Vice President is the only person , in either party , with the years of training and experience . . . and the wisdom that comes from experience ... to qualify him to succeed President Eisenhower . " <P> No opium smoker , Nixon was already drafting specific planks in a program that will stress many of the same ends of national well-being proclaimed by his Democratic opponents but will emphasize voluntary , nonfederal means . Items : <P> Plans for urban renewal and medical assistance for the aged , stressing voluntary participation by states , municipalities and individuals , instead of programs keyed to federal intervention . <P> A farm program recognizing the farmer as " a person who is not getting his fair share of America 's increasing prosperity . " <P> A system of fostering economic growth , " not through increasing the size of Government , but by expanding the opportunities for creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
