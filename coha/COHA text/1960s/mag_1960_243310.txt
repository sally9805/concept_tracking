When golf 's self-styled experts made early book on the P.G.A . Championships at Akron , Ohio last week , the man most everyone overlooked was Junius Joseph Hebert ( pronounced : Eh-bear ) , 37 , brother of 1957 P.G.A . winner Lionel Hebert . A handsome , black-haired playboy , he had a record as a perennial also-ran with only a scattering of victories in his 12-year career . <P> Arnold Palmer , U.S. Open and Masters champion , was a heavy 3-1 choice to win : aging Ben Hogan and ageless Sam Snead were the sentimental favorites . The oddsmakers failed to figure the crushing impact of the course-or that Jay Hebert was overdue . <P> Until famed Golf Architect Robert Trent Jones finished his pernicious labors , the Firestone Country Club , private pasture of U.S. rubber barons , had offered nothing more complicated than a pleasant social sojourn on a workday afternoon . <P> For last week 's P.G.A. , its fairways were trimmed to 30-yd. widths , its undulating greens were tucked behind yawning lakes ; deep bunkers dotted its entire 7,165-yd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bogeyman second round : " It 's beyond me . I 'm just not good enough for this course . " Neither were Palmer , Snead and Hogan - at least last week . Ben Hogan was unable to earn a single birdie in the first 54 holes , did not survive the final cut . Palmer took a horrendous triple-bogey 8 on the 625-yd. 16th on the third day , finished with a six-over-par 286 , retired to the sidelines as a TV commentator . Snead cashed out with bogeys on the last two holes . But for graceful Jay Hebert , the grueling Firestone course was tailor-made . <P> Firing a remarkably steady 72-67-72-70 for a one-over-par 281 , Hebert laid a five iron 8 ft. from the pin on the 71st hole , sank his putt for a birdie , and coasted to the clubhouse , victor by a stroke over 45-year-old Jim Ferrier . His prize : a record $11,000 , wrested from the nation 's best pressure golfers .                   @ @
