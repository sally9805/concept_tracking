The job of U.S. Ambassador to France was once the envied passport to a life of gaiet parisienne . Since Charles de Gaulle 's relations with Washington turned frosty in the early 1960s , however , the post has had some of the aspects of representing the U.S. in a hostile land . There were those who suspected Lyndon Johnson of shipping Sargent Shriver to the Siberian salt mines when the President picked him to succeed Career Diplomat Charles ( " Chip " ) Bohlen in Paris . Bohlen made no secret of his sense of futility in dealing with the Elysee and the Quai d'Orsay . Undaunted , Shriver has brought to his new job the same inventiveness and dash with which he led the Peace Corps and the U.S. war on poverty ; in a few short months , he has given U.S. diplomacy a rare and welcome panache . <P> Shriver and his wife , the former Eunice Kennedy , set a tone of informality from the moment they arrived . They were soon bicycling busily around the chic 16th Arrondissement . In front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide gutters of the elegant Avenue d'lna excellent for sailing model boats . <P> Beatles and Indians .

The walls are now covered with paintings by Jackson Pollock , Jasper Johns and Georgia O'Keeffe , plus a collection of Indians by George Catlin and Roy Lichtenstein 's pop portrait of George Washington . <P> The diplomatic happenings on the Avenue d'lna have become a new fix ture of the Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen soirees for 30 to 50 young French and American students and professional people . Shriver acts as moderator , pacing about , sitting in a chair or squatting on the floor . On one such evening , Economist Walter Heller discussed the new Gaullist idea of employee participation in management with French economics students , financial writers and young Finance Ministry experts . Another evening pitted Evangelist Billy Graham against the World Council of Churches ' Eugene Carson Blake before a group of worker-priests and students . Recently , U.S. Health , Education and Welfare Secretary Wilbur Cohen squared off with some 50 French university students , many of them turtlenecked rebel leaders of last May 's uprising . <P> Bare Feet and Bathrobe . When the Orchestre de Paris left last week for an American tour , the usual thing would have been for the U.S. ambassador and his wife to have the conductor and the concertmaster to dinner .
