HARRY , THE RAT WITH WOMEN by Jules Feiffer. 181 pages . McGraw-Hill. $3.95 . <P> <P> As a sketch-and-word man , Jules ( Sick , Sick , Sick ) Feiffer trades heavily in the guilt-edged insecurities of modern America . Meaning well and putting their trust in Freud , Feiffer 's cartoon characters are forever trying to find themselves and at the same time break through to others . " Do I really love her , " Feiffer youths keep asking themselves , " or is she just a fertility symbol ? " " Is it passion that makes me kiss him , " their girls muse , " or am I just acting out an anti-male hostility aggression through my lips ? " <P> What they all seek , of course , is love , love , love . Now , in a tragi-cosmic fable which is his first try at fiction , Feiffer tells them what life would be like if they really found it . Sheer hell . <P> " Why Am I Exciting ? " Harry is a kind of body-by-Fisher King of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not get enough of it . Harry gets all that America can provide-at first without any of the customary complications . " Unlike other parents who found their children lovable enough to eat-and so did-Harry 's . . . nibbled only lovingly and slightly . " Entirely adored , he is entirely self-centered and entirely beautiful . He is an American ideal , a protected boy-man untroubled by thought , untwisted by complexes , unhaunted by feelings of insecurity . As a result , he is irresistible . <P> <P> " Why am I exciting ? " a girl whispers to Harry . <P> " You remind me a little of me , " says Harry . <P> As a succession of fell females fall for Harry , it looks as if Feiffer is merely having a little fun at the expense of U.S. preoccupation with self-preoccupation . But Harry soon proves to be an innocent Candide ripe for torment on the low road to worldly wisdom . What blights Harry 's cheerful narcissism is the warped love of a good woman . Her message : Harry must make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , give , " she chants . <P> Harry gives some flowers-not to her but to his wife , a beautiful woman whom Feiffer describes as " a free-lance castrater . " Next morning Harry , who until then has been physically flawless , wakes with a pimple on his nose . <P> Seeing Is Becoming . Switching from taking to giving ruins Harry 's love life . " Those who once moved silkily toward him began to jerk , stumble , twitch and fall . " Sympathy and empathy for all his fellow creatures sets in . He becomes what he sees . He limps in the presence of the halt . His stomach bloats . His hair falls out . He becomes ugly . He dies-longing to be his old self-contained self once more , but unable to cure himself of his disease . <P> <P> Feiffer 's stylized fairy tale can be read , some of the time , as light summer fiction . It is studded with scenes of cheerfully skin-deep satire and divertingly chuckleheaded dialogue . But occasionally Feiffer 's laughter comes close to a stifled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Nathanael West 's Miss Lonelyhearts took to heart the troubles reflected in his advice-to-the-lovelorn column , and was destroyed by acute compassion .
