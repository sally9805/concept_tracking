A Shot in the Dark . Four shots , in fact . A police car roars up to the porte-cochere of a chateau and out steps-sacrebleu ! - it is the terror of Montmartre , the Napoleon of criminology ! It is Inspector Clouseau ( Peter Sellers ) of the Suret . Fresh from his daring exploits in The Pink Panther , the inspector is a model of sangfroid . Beneath the vigorous mustache , the lips are ironical ; beneath the snap-brim felt , the darting eyes see everything-well , everything except the goldfish pond . Splat ! <P> Sopping but unstoppable , Clouseau suspiciously sniffs at a jar of cold cream , moves away with a big white blob on the end of his nose . He reflectively sucks on a ballpoint pen , resumes the interrogation with a bright blue tongue . He nervously lights the cigarette of a seductive suspect ( Elke Sommer ) , forgets to extinguish the lighter before he puts it back in his pocket . " Eeeeeeeeek , " Elke squeals a moment later . " You 're on fire ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trench coat , strides to the window and-wham ! The chief inspector ( Herbert Lorn ) bursts through the bedroom door , the bedroom door clouts Clouseau in the suffix , Clouseau takes off as though there were lead as well as copper in his alloy . When next seen he is digging himself out of a gravel driveway two stories below and cringing as the chief inspector scornfully adds insult to injury . " Clouseau ! " the old brute bellows . " You 're off the case . " <P> Obviously , Inspector Clouseau never does solve his case , but he manages , in a manner of speaking , to dissolve it : the suspects are all blown to bits by a bomb . Long before that hilarious moment-even though the inspector occasionally palls , and the one-joke script is much less amusing than the Broadway farce " it is broadly adapted from-most customers will have reinforced a general conviction and a popular hope : that Peter Sellers is one of the funniest men alive and that the dear fellow will please get well quick .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
