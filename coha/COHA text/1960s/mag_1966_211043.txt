The problem of desertion from the ranks has long given the South Vietnamese army nearly as much trouble as the Communist enemy . Some 37,000 regular , regional and popular government forces deserted in 1963 , twice that many the next year , and 113,000 last year . During the first six months of this year , 67,000 went over the hill , a shocking annual rate of more than one man in every five under arms . <P> The reason has to do partly with the fatigue of 20 years of war , partly with French colonial policy , which promoted few Vietnamese to officer rank , and partly with the flimsy framework of new nationhood . Even after the French left , there was a shortage of nearly everything needed for a good army : buildings , bases , firing ranges , leadership , esprit . Loyalties continued to go to family rather than the new nation . <P> Until last month there was not even a law against desertion . Now the Ky government has decreed that a deserter will be sentenced to five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A second offense will mean ten years , and a third death . Advance warning of the decree began last April , and the regular-army desertion rate has already begun to drop , from 24 per 1,000 men in March to twelve by the end of July . Moreover , many classified as deserters in the past had simply gone home to join the army unit closest to the family-and were almost impossible to track . The U.S. command in Saigon is setting up a punch-card system for the regular Vietnamese army so that it will know where all its men are at any given time . Meanwhile , U.S. observers like to remind critics that the Union Army ran up a total of 200,000 deserters during the Civil War .
