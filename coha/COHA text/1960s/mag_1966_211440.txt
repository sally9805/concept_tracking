If the conversation had lagged last week at the New York Hilton Hotel , where the Salvation Army in nonsectarian generosity honored Francis Cardinal Spellman , hosts and guests could have turned to a subject of mutual interest : sales of Listerine antiseptic . Listerine at a religious convocation ? Why not-since , under terms of an old and apparently inviolable legal document , Warner-Lambert Pharmaceutical Co. must still make royalty payments on Listerine to the heirs , executors or assignees of its originator . The assignees include the Salvation Army , and until recently counted the aging cardinal as a major holder . <P> Almost as Fortunate . In 1950 , New York Real Estate Broker John J. Reynolds-the man who first interested Joseph P. Kennedy in Manhattan real estate-purchased a 50% share of Listerine royalties ; the beneficial rights were later transferred to the Catholic archdiocese of New York . The 1950 price was about $4,000,000 , and few investments have proved more profitable . In less than 16 years , the royalty payments on the 50% exceeded $13 million ; this year alone the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , in order to obtain funds , the archdiocese sold its interest to a group of 15 pension funds , universities , hospitals and individuals . It had to pay $1,000,000 , covering legal fees and a commission , to the Wall Street firm of Laird &; Co. , which arranged the transaction . But the sales price , along with the yearly royalty payments , , meant a cool $25.5 million collected from Listerine . <P> The Salvation Army has been almost as fortunate . The army , through a gift , owns a small share of the royalties , which have steadily increased as Listerine remained dominant in the rapidly expanding U.S. mouthwash market . Other small amounts are held , and income is gained , by Wellesley College and the American Bible Society . <P> From the Formula . The base for these royalty riches was laid in 1881 when Dr. Joseph Joshua Lawrence , a St. Louis physician who worked out the secret formula for Listerine , decided to retire . The canny doctor sold his formula for Listerine and , four years later , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jordan W. Lambert . In the deal , Lawrence got a royalty for each gross ( 144 bottles ) of Listerine that was first set at $20 ; this was later scaled down to $6 on sales of either preparation . Lithiated Hydrangea has disappeared-but Listerine sales spiraled after Lambert 's son made halitosis a household word . The rights remained within the Lawrence family until 1950 , by which time the massive royalties were making them expensive for tax-paying individuals to own . <P> The royalty arrangement meanwhile has lasted despite efforts to break it . Warner-Lambert , the company that ' evolved from the Lamberts ' firm , last tried to break the arrangement in 1960 and was turned down flatly by a federal appeals court . Lawrence 's heirs , who still retain about three-eighths of the royalties , continue to benefit as a result , and so do assignees of one of the most remarkable transactions in U.S. business history . Warner-Lambert this year , on sales of Listerine worth $50 million or more , will pay out about $4,000,000 in royalties.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
