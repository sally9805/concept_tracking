txt  | with the cellulose and other carbohydrates of the cell walls , a tissue of excellent strength and durability . In a sense , lignified tissues such as wood are comparable to fiber-reinforced plastics in which the lignin represents the plastic binder and the cellulose the reinforcing fibers . Plant lignin is concentrated mainly in the space between the cells ( middle lamella ) where it is deposited during the lignification of the plant tissue . The completion of the lignification process usually coincides with stoppage of the living functions of the cells . It is not surprising , therefore , that lignin has been shown to be an irreversible end product of plant metabolism . The chemical differences that exist between lignin and the other two classes of natural polymers , the carbohydrates and proteins , are quite profound . Wood lignins , for instance , are predominantly aromatic and almost totally insoluble in known solvents , not hydrolyzable to monomeric units , and devoid of the highly regular structure so characteristic of other natural polymers . These properties , connected with the tendency to undergo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatments , have made structural studies on lignins exceedingly difficult , and at present a detailed knowledge on lignin structure is lacking . Plant lignins can be divided into three broad classes that are commonly called softwood ( gymnosperm ) , hardwood ( angiosperm ) , and grass lignins . Of these , the softwood lignins form a very homogeneous group , and little if any differences in structure and properties are found between individual species . This group is also that most thoroughly studied . Hardwood and grass lignins , although less completely investigated , appear to show more variance with species . I. Lignin Preparations As lignins are insoluble in their native state , the isolation of representative preparations for study presents an important problem in lignin chemistry . For certain purposes , of course , it is not necessary to isolate lignin in pure state because the chemical differences between lignin and carbohydrates often make it possible to use an extractivefree plant material for experimentation . However , when it is necessary to perform a separation of the plant components in order to obtain a carbohydrate-free lignin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lignin during the process .  | Originally cellulose and hemicelluloses were extracted from lignified tissue ( with subsequent hydrolysis ) by treatment with strong sulfuric acid ( 111 ) ( Mason lignin ) , or with fuming hydrochloric acid ( 191 ) ( Willstdtter lignin ) . When diluted with water , a brown insoluble substance known as acid lignin remains insoluble . This method is also used for the quantitative determination of lignin ( 92d ) ( 72% sulfuric acid generally is used ) , although several uncertainties make the exactness of the method somewhat questionable ( 143,183 ) . The determined values are , nevertheless , in good accordance with those calculated on the basis of the holocellulose contents ( 185 ) . Table I summarizes a number of lignin determinations by the sulfuric acid method on various woods . figure The drastic conditions used in the preparation of acid lignins cause structural changes in lignin ; for instance , the reactivity in sulfonation is decreased ( 93 ) . Consequently , several efforts have been made to minimize the chemical changes in the preparation of acid lignins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson ( 9. l ) were able to prepare a hydrochloric acid lignin which could be totally dissolved by sulfonation . Extensive work by Freudenberg ( 80 ) and his school has been done on cuproxam lignin . This preparation is isolated by treating extracted sawdust alternately with boiling dilute ncid nn ( I 0innnoniacal copper oxide solution , by which means  | the cellulose is gradually removed . Differences in the chemical behavior of wood and cuproxam lignins indicate that even this procedure has not been without effect on the sensitive units in lignin ( 72 ) . Only a very small portion of lignin ( 2 to 3% of softwood and 4 to 7% of hardwood lignin ) can be extracted directly by organic solvents . The isolation of the soluble lignin has been described by Brauns ( 25 ) . Ground plant material is exhaustively extracted with alcohol and the total extracts are precipitated by ether . Ether dissolves the nonlignin components leaving lignin undissolved in the form of a light creamcolored powder , generally referred to as " Brauns native lignin " ( BNL ) . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of protolignin . It shows the same color reactions and similar composition as the insoluble protolignin ; many of the known reactions of the latter , such as sulfonation , alcoholysis , phenolysis , and reaction with thioglycolic acid can be carried out on BNL preparations to yield products with similar compositions and characteristics . Although BNL is an excellent material for many lignin studies , it would be incorrect to regard it as identical with the rest of protolignin . BNL certainly has a lower molecular weight , and has been shown to contain more phenolic hydroxyl groups ( 15 ) than the insoluble protolignin . More protolignin can be transformed to a soluble form if wood meal is first subjected to the action of certain wood-rotting fungi ( 165 ) . Such " enzymatically liberated " lignins can represent as much as 21% of the total lignin . Marked similarity exists between the enzymatically liberated and the corresponding Brauns native lignins , both in analytical composition and in optical behavior ( ultraviolet and infrared spectra ) . Through the use of an elaborate grinding procedure , Bjorkman ( 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protolignin in spruce wood soluble in aqueous dioxane . Analytical data on Bjorlcman lignin demonstrate that the original lignin structure has been more efficiently preserved than in other lignin preparations . Specific conditions are necessary to produce the desired solubility ( e.g. , the use of a vibrational ball mill with the wood meal immersed in a nonswelling medium , such as toluene , during the grinding ) . It would not appear impossible , therefore , that some chemical linkages are broken during the process , although the extent of breakage may be quite small . It was shown recently that carbon-to-carbon linkages in rubber are in  | part split by extensive grinding , with the formation of free radicals ( 189 ) . Periodate lignin , isolated by Purves and co-workers ( 158 ) by degradation of wood carbohydrates with potassium periodate , probably represents largely unchanged lignin , although some degradation of aromatic nuclei containing free phenolic groups may occur ( 147 ) . Dioxane-hydrochloric acid lignin ( 62,179 ) can be extracted in approximately 15% yield of the total lignin with aqueous dioxane containing 2.5% hydrochloric acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the preparation contains about 1.5 to 2% of chlorine . Finally , an artificial lignin called Dehydrogenation polymerizate ( DHP ) , prepared by Freudenberg ( 70 ) , should be mentioned . This polymeric substance is formed by enzymatic dehydrogenation of coniferyl alcohol . Its characteristics and significance to lignin synthesis in vivo will be discussed in Section V. II . Structure of Lignin Lignin probably represents one of the least attractive substances for structural evaluation by the methods of classical organic chemistry . It is generally insoluble in common organic solvents and also undergoes chemical changes under relatively mild conditions . Degradation to simple identifiable compounds always remains incomplete , and often these products are artifacts formed during the degradation , rather than representative of the original structures in lignin . This peculiar behavior explains why progress in the field has remained relatively slow in proportion to the work done . The absence of rigorous data has led to the proposal of a number of speculative structures for lignin . In testing the validity of various assertions , research on low molecular weight model compounds has often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the structural problems of lignin is laborious and has its limitations . Clearly , a pronounced dissimilarity in chemical behavior between a model and lignin con incingly invalidates the presence of structures similar to the model in the latter , at least as major components . However , if lignin and a model or a group of models react similarly when subjected to the same con 00 Iil ions , this gigs an indication , but never a rigorous proof , that  | the same structures are operative in both cases . In view of this ambiguity , it is not surprising that differing opinions have existed concerning the significance of model compound research . To many structural problems in lignin chemistry , however , comparative studies between lignin and lignin models appear to represent the only accessible pathway of approach . A. THE CONCEPT OF LIGNIN AS A PIIENYLPHOPANE POLYMER The aromatic nature of lignin in situ was convincingly demonstrated by Lange ( 121 ) who showed that spruce wood exhibits a characteristic ultraviolet absorption spectrum , similar to those of certain solid guaiacylpropane model compounds . Purves and coworkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spruce lignins by difference , from the analytical values on extracted wood material and on holocellulose , respectively . The calculated composition ( C = 67.5% , II = 6% ) is in accordance with an aromatic substance . The possibility of spruce lignin being composed of phenylpropane units was already recognized by early investigators , namely , Klason ( 110 ) and Tiemann and Haarmann ( 181 ) . Later , Freudenberg ( 65 ) demonstrated that the elemental composition of spruce lignin conforms closely to that of a guaiacylpropane polymer . The concept has found valuable support in that a number of phenylpropane derivatives have been isolated from the degradation products of not only spruce , but also of other plant lignins. 3 2 Phenylpropane unit Phillips ( 152a ) was the first to isolate a phenylpropane derivative , dihydroeugenol , ( VII ) , from the degradation products of lignin . This compound was obtained by subjecting alkali corncob lignin to destructive distillation ( 152a ) under reduced pressure . More recently , a large number of various phenylpropane derivatives have been isolated by using improved degradation techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspen methanol lignin and by using copper chromite as a catalyst , Harris , D'Iarni , and Adkins ( ! NM ) were able to isolate the propylcyclohexane derivatives ( I ) , ( 1I ) , and figure  | ( III ) . The same procedure was later extended by Hibbcrt and coworkers ( 85 ) to the investigation of maple and spruce woods and of maple ethanol lignin . The same products were isolated . When Raney nickel is used as catalyst , the hydrogenation of lignin can be carried out so that the aromatic nuclei remain intact . By applying this technique , Hibbert and co-workers ( 28 ) isolated compounds ( IV ) , ( V ) , and ( VI ) from hydrogenated maple lignin . Shorygina ( 171 ) treated spruce wood flour with sodium in liquid ammonia and isolated dihydroeugenol ( VII ) and 1-guaiacylpropanol-2 ( VIII ) in good yields figure  | from the reaction products . Hibbert and co-workers ( 190 ) were able to isolate guaiacyl derivatives ( IX ) , ( X ) , ( XI ) , and ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maple lignin yielded the corresponding syringyl compounds ( XIII ) , ( XIV ) , and ( XV ) ( 135 ) in addition to the guaiacyl derivatives mentioned . figure Table I1 gives the yields of isolated phenylpropane derivatives . 1lydrogenatsion and treatment with sodium in liquid ammonia obviously give the highest yields . Still the amounts of identified products generally correspond to less than one-half of the original lignin . Lignin is not degraded completely to monomers , mainly because part of the phenylpropane units are joined by carbon-tocarbon linkages , in a manner to be described later . ( ) n this basis , gymnosperm lignins generally are considered to represent polymers containing exclusively guaiacylpropane units . This view may not be rigorously correct , but should be regarded as a useful approximation that conforms relatively well to the methoxyl contents of various gymnosperm lignin preparations . I lardwood ( angiosperm ) lignins contain both guaiacyl- and syringylpropane units . How these units combine to form the lignin molecules poses an interesting question of lignin chemistry . First , hardwood lignin could be a random copolymer of guaiacyl- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the monomers could exist in separate molecules forming a mixture of " guaiacyl lignin " and " syringyl lignin . " Although the question must be considered unsettled as yet , evidence favoring the latter hypothesis has been presented . As a minor component , many plant lignins may contain p-hydroxyphenylpropane units . Goldschmid ( 87 ) has shown that western hemlock wood , as well as the BNB preparation from the same wood , yield , after hydrolysis , small amounts of p-coumaraldehyde ( XVI ) , besides other identified products . figure Further support for the existence of p-hydroxyphenylpropane units is afforded by the isolation of small amounts ( 0.25% ) of phydroxybenzaldehyde ( XVII ) ( 124 ) from the nitrobenzene oxidation products of spruce wood lignin . In this connection , certain studies on grass lignins are of interest . These lignins yield substantial amounts of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde on alkaline hydrolysis ( 40 ) . However , with the exception of p-hydroxycinnamic acid ( 173 ) which exists in bagasse lignin in ester-like combination , no p-hydroxyphenylpropane derivatives have been isolated so far . Stone and co-workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the opinion that p-hydroxybenzaldehyde actually may not be derived from a lignin component . From their studies on living wheat plants containing radioactively labeled lignin , they concluded that components yielding p-hydroxybenzaldehyde in nitrobenzene oxidation participate in plant metabolism , whereas the progenitors of vanillin and syringaldehyde apparently do not ( 177 ) . This would indicate that lignin , being an irreversible end product of metabolism , is not the source of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde . At least a part of the lat ter compound could be formed from tyrosine units in wheat protein that were shown to be converted to p-hydroxyhenzaldehyde on nitrobenzene oxidation . Certain aromatic carboxylic acids , present in a number of plant lignins , form a class of their own among the lignin components . By carrying out an alkaline hydrolysis on aspen BNL , Smith ( 174 ) was able to isolate p-hydroxybenzoic ; acid ( XVIII ) in a yield correspond-  | ing to 10% of the preparation . The rate of the hydrolysis process indicated that the acid is linked as an ester to the aliphatic hydroxyl groups of the lignin . Similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of p-hydroxycinnamic acid after alkaline hydrolysis ( 173 ) . p-Hydroxycinnamic acid is absent in wheat BNI. which contains p-hydroxybenzoic , vanillic ( XIX ) , syringic ( XX ) , and ferulic ( XXI ) acids , present as minor constituents in the bagasse BNL . Only traces of such acids were isolated from Douglas-fir BNL , indicating that the contribution of ester groups to the composition of softwood lignins is of minor significance . figure It is interesting to note that p-hydroxybenzoic , vanillic , and syringic acids all contain a C6C skeleton and , consequently , form an exception to the rule characterizing all lignins as phenylpropane ( C6C3 ) polymers . It may be pointed out , however , that the mode of combination of these acids with the lignin molecule is exceptional and , for this reason , they need not be considered lignin monomers in the proper sense . With this provision , the concept of lignins as phenylpropane polymers appears to be valid without exception . B. THE MODE OF COMBINATION OF MONOMERIC UNITS IN LIGNIN In the lignin macromolecule , the monomeric phenylpropane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linkages . The latter linkages are highly resistant towards chemical degradation and constitute the main factor inhibiting the conversion of lignins to monomeric units in such treatments as hydrogenation , ethanolysis , etc . Figures 2 and 3 summarize the current views about the nature of intermonomeric linkages in lignin . It should be emphasized that it ,  | has not been possible , as yet , to provide rigorous chemical proof for the existence of many of these linkages . They were originally proposed to account for the chemical behavior of lignins . These largely speculative propositions recently have gained strong experimental support from studies directed towards elucidating the mechanism of lignin formation in living plants . The following section will review the chemical evidence supporting the presented intermonomeric bonds , whereas the biochemical evidence will be given in Section V. However , it may be appropriate at this point to refer to one elegant biochemical method which undoubtedly will become increasingly important in the clarification of the structural aspects of lignin . Research by Freudenberg ( 64 ) and by Kratzl and Billek ( 115 ) has demonstrated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lignins in which specific side-chain carbon atoms ( alpha , beta , or gamma ) of the phenylpropane units are radioactive . This is done by administering properly labeled n-coniferin to living plants which convert it to lignin . To date , all three specifically labeled spruce lignins have been prepared . Studies on these radioactive lignins have been invaluable , among other applications , in establishing the nature of carbon-tocarbon linkages in lignin. 1 . Ether Linkages a . Phenolic Ether Linkages On the basis of analytical determinations on Bjorkman spruce lignin the content of free phenolic hydroxyl groups has been established to be about 0.30 mole per mole of methoxyl groups ( 100 ) . In other words , approximately 30% of the guaiacylpropane units contain a free phenolic group ; the remaining 70% of the units accordingly should be etherified . Since no diary ether derivatives have been isolated from lignin , it is generally assumed that the 4-position in the etherified units is connected to a side-chain carbon of another monomer by an ether linkage . A part of the phenolic ether linkages probably belongs to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3-aryl ether structures ( Fig. 3 ) , to be discussed later in this chapter in connection with the ethanolysis and hydrolysis reactions of lignin . It has been suggested that guaiacylglycerol- , Q-aryl ether structures may be present in about 25 to 33% of the monomeric units ( 1 ' 1 ) . If this estimate is accepted ,  | the 0-4 ' ether linkages may account for up to one-half of the phenolic ether linkages. figure Another part of the phenolic ether linkages may belong to the a-4 ' - type , such as exemplified by the multi-bound benzofurane structure in Fig. 3. b . Dialkyl Ether Linkages In addition to phenolic ether linkages , the phenylpropane units iu lignin also are connected by ether bonds between the side chains of two monomeric units . Two such bonds , both of the a-y ' - type , exist in the multilinked pinoresinol structure ( Fig. 3 ) whose presence in the lignin structure is postulated mainly on the basis of biogenetic csv 1dence . The . alpha-alkyl ether linkage given in Fig. 2 represents another tact are where the ether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ether bond " ) . These structures were originally proposed by Lindgren ( 128 ) to account for the hydrolytic solvation of the so-called " solid lignosulfonic acid . " It has been proposed by Freudenberg ( 64 ) that the bonds linking lignin to the carbohydrates might be of the alpha-alkyl ether type . The total amount of dialkyl ether linkages in softwood lignin is not exactly known . Estimations based on lignin preparations amount to about 0.35 per methoxyl , on a molar basis ( 22 ) . 2 . Carbon-to-Carbon Linkages a . Substituted and Unsubstituted Units The phenylpropane units containing an intermonomeric carbon-tocarbon linkage at the aromatic nucleus usually are called " substituted " units to differentiate them from the unsubstituted ones which are devoid of such linkages . Two methods are available for the conversion of both the unsubstituted and substituted units to identifiable low-molecular weight compounds . The principles of these methods are illustrated in the following scheme for the case of an unsubstituted unit : figure The permanganate method was developed by Freudenberg ( 69 ) and consists of the hydrolysis of the phenolic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a methylation step to protect the phenolic groups thus liberated and by a permanganate oxidal 11 ) 11 1 hat degrades the side-chains to carboxylic groups ( see Fig. 4 ) . figure  | The second method , also developed by Freudenberg ( 73 ) , utilizes a milder oxidant , nitrobenzene , for the degradation of the side chains mainly to aldehydic , and partially to carboxylic , groups . The protection of the free phenol groups is , in this case , unnecessary , and consequently the hydrolysis and oxidation can be carried out in one operation . Higher yields of identified products generally are obtained by the nitrobenzene method , which has therefore been widely used for both structural and taxonomic studies . In the nitrobenzene oxidation of softwood lignins , 31.9 to 32.3% of the phenylpropane units are isolated in the form of identified compounds ( 124 ) . Of these , vanillin ( XXV ) is obtained in highest yields , corresponding to 25 to 28% of Klason lignin ( Table IV ) . Small figure  | amounts of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde ( XXX ) and syringaldehyde ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of p-hydroxyphenylpropane and syringylpropane units as minor constituents in spruce lignin ( Table III ) ( 124 ) . Dicotyledons , including hardwoods , give higher total yields of aldehydes ( 31 to 51% of the Mason lignin ) and the ratio of vanillin to syringaldehyde is usually 1:3 ( 39 ) . p-Hydroxybenzaldehyde has not been isolated ( 126 ) . The nitrobenzene oxidation products of monocotyledons ( e.g. grasses , bamboo , etc. ) contain , in addition to vanillin and syringaldehyde ( usually isolated in 1:1 molar ratio ) , substantial amounts of phydroxybenzaldehyde ( 40 ) . By comparing the yields of nitrobenzene oxidation products from lignins to the yields obtained in the oxidation of model compounds , attempts have been made to estimate the amount of unsubstituted guaiacylpropane units in softwood lignins . Since the vanillin yields from model compounds are variable , such estimates can only be approximate . It has been proposed that roughly 50% ( 123 ) or possibly more ( 152 ) , of the monomeric units belong to the unsubstituted type . The amount of unsubstituted units in hardwood lignins is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the guaiacylpropane units constitute the lignin , appear to exist exclusively in the unsubstituted form . For this reason , hardwood lignins generally give relatively high yields of aldehydes in nitrobenzene oxidation . It should be observed , however , that the vanillin to syringaldehyde ratio ( 1:3 ) differs from the ratio of guaiacyl- and syringylpropane units in lignin . On the basis of the methoxyl contents of hardwood lignin preparations ( 165 ) , these units appear to be present in approximately equal amounts . The substituted units , which may total up to 50% in softwood lignins , are of two different types . In the majority of substituted units , the 5-position is linked to a side-chain carbon atom of another unit . These units are partially converted to isohemipinic acid ( XXXI ) by the permanganate oxidation method ( Table III ) ( 69 ) and yield a number of 5-substituted degradation products in the nitrobenzene oxidation ( Fig. 4 ) . Recent work by Freudenberg ( 64,67 ) on radioactive spruce lignin has proven beyond doubt that the 5-position ii these units is connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed that a spruce lignin and a DHP preparation , both of which were specifically labeled in the beta-position , yielded  | radioactive isohemipinic acid . The observed radioactivity undoubtedly is due to the 5-carboxyl group in the isolated isohemipinic acid . The isohemipinic acid from a gamma-labeled DHP preparation was inactive , demonstrating the absence of y-5 ' linkages . In a part of the substituted units a bond probably exists between the 5-positions of two units . Dehydrodiveratric acid ( XXXII ) and dehydrodivanillin ( XXXVII ) ( Fig. 4 ) represent degradation products of such structures . Originally regarded to be artifacts formed in the degradation process , these compounds now are believed to originate from 5-5 ' bonded structures in lignin ( 152 ) . The free phenolic hydroxyl groups , present in approximately 30% of the monomeric units , are distributed between the unsubstituted and substituted units . This was shown by Richtzenhain ( 156 ) , who methylated spruce wood meal with diazomethane to convert the phenolic hydroxyl groups to methoxyl groups and subsequently oxidized the product with permanganate . Veratric and isohemipinic acids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yields corresponding to 4.9 and 0.9% , respectively . However , no traces of dehydrodiveratric acid were found . b. ( 3- ( 3 ' Carbon-to-Carbon Linkages The naturally occurring lignans , such as pinoresinol , conidendrin , matairesinol , etc. , are guaiacyl- or syringylpropane dimers in which the two units are connected by a 13-0 ' linkage . For this reason , similar structures in lignin are often called " lignan structures . " The only direct chemical evidence for the presence of 0-0 ' linkages has been afforded by Russian workers ( 172 ) . They have claimed the isolation of a hydrogenated lignan , **30;670;TOOLONG , from the products obtained by treating cuproxam lignin with sodium and liquid ammonia . Lignin often undergoes secondary condensation reactions during the isolation process , especially if acidic conditions are used . As a consequence , anomalous products are sometimes isolated when lignin preparations are degraded oxidatively . As an example , Richtzenhain ( 156 ) subjected acid lignins and lignosulfonic acid to methylation and permanganate oxidation , and was able to isolate up to 1.3% of rnhemipinic acid ( XXXIX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally obtained . According to Richtzenhain , the formation of m-hemipinic acid may be connected with lignan structures iii lignin  | that could rearrange or condense to isolignan structures under acidic conditions . figure Another anomalous degradation product , benzene pentacarboxylic acid ( XL ) , is obtained when isolated lignins are directly oxidized with permanganate ( 154 ) . The yields from various lignin preparations range from 0.6 to 2.0% , whereas only trace amounts ( 0.14% ) of this acid are obtained from spruce protolignin . The benzene pentacarboxylic acid may very well be an oxidation product of the secondarily formed ring in an isolignan structure . C. a-a ' Carbon-to-Carbon Linkages The presence of a-a ' linkages in lignin was first proposed by Pearl ( 145 ) to account for the isolation of the following dimeric products from the cupric oxide oxidation of lignin : figure Of these , XLI was regarded to be a direct oxidation product of a-a ' - linked structure . In structure X11I , the a-O ' - linkage was considered to be an artifact , formed in the rearrangement of an originally a-a ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments . figure  | the alkaline hydrolysis of spruce lignosulfonic acids ( 157 ) and from the alkaline oxidation products of red pine sawdust ( 180 ) . figure C. GENERAL ASPECTS OF LIGNIN AS A MACROMOLECULE The purpose of the preceding discussion was to present some of the current views of the nature of linkages between monomeric units in lignin . The picture of lignin , as it is unveiled from these still largely speculative assertions , is that of a complex polymer whose complexity is owing not to the multitude of monomeric units , but to the variety of ways in which these units can be linked . This applies , of course , mainly to spruce and other softwood lignins with which the majority of experimental data are concerned . The information on hardwood and grass lignins is still too scanty to justify a discussion , even on speculative grounds . The question whether we should expect lignin to be a regularly built polymer , or whether the structural elements might be combined in a random fashion , has considerable theoretical interest . The idea of a well-defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was advanced by Brauns ( 25 ) and he was also able to supply certain analytical data to support his view . Later analyses on different structural elements such as coniferyl aldehyde groups ( 4 ) have not been easily compatible with this concept . Although any rigorous experimental evidence is lacking , a certain amount of structural randomness in lignin should be considered a fair possibility , especially if the concept of lignin biogenesis , as proposed by Freudenberg ( 63 ) , is considered correct . Freudenberg assumes that the enzymatic action in this process is limited to the formation of coniferyl alcohol radicals ; the subsequent combination of these radicals to form lignin can scarcely be expected to lead to any uniform structures , nor to a uniform molecular weight . The majority of natural , as well as synthetic , polymers is built up according to the " head-to-tail " principle . The evidence presented in the previous sections points out that this is not the case with lignin . If we arbitrarily designate the side chain of a phenylpropaue unit is  | the " head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tail , " the following three categories of linkages between monomeric units are more or less likely to be present in spruce lignin : 1 . " Head-to-tail " linkages : ( a ) alkyl-aryl ether linkages between C4 and a side-chain carbon in another unit ; ( b ) carbon-to-carbon linkages between C5 and a side-chain carbon , probably Co. 2 . " Head-to-head " linkages : ( a ) linkages between a carbon atoms of two monomeric units ; ( b ) dialkyl-ether linkages between C , , and a side-chain carbon in another monomer ; ( c ) a-a ' carbon linkages ( Pearl ) . 3 . " Tail-to-tail " linkages : 5-5 ' carbon bonds . Let us first consider such fragments of the lignin molecule that are built up entirely according to the head-to-tail principle . These fragments may exist as chain-like aggregates , or if the heads and/or tails act bifunctionally , also branches might be present . To create a preliminary picture of lignin as a macromolecule , we can presently ignore the latter possibility , keeping in mind that such simplification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fragments connected by head-to-tail linkages would act as " primary chains " of a cross-linked lignin molecule . The average length of the primary chains can be generally estimated from the amount of end groups . The coniferyl aldehyde groups are probably end groups , but likely to be present only in a fraction of primary chains . It seems reasonable , however , that an unsubstituted guaiacyl unit with a free phenolic hydroxyl group may exist as an end group in every primary chain . figure A minimum for the free guaiacyl units can be estimated from the yields of veratric acid from diazomethane methylated wood . llichtzenhain 's results correspond to about 0.055 free guaiacyl unit per methoxyl ( 156 ) . From this we may conclude that the average degree of polymerization of primary chains is certainly less than 18. ( iuslafsson and Andersen ( 91 ) have developed a method for the est filial ion of unsrrbstituted guaiacyl units containing a free phenolic group . Such groups react with nitric acid to give dinitro guaiacol.  | figure The tatter compound can be determined quantitatively by paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compounds , the authors estimate roughly one free guaiacyl group out of 15 phenylpropane units for spruce lignin ; this result corresponds , of course , to an average degree of polymerization of 15 of the primary chains . In view of the estimated contents of phenolic hydroxyl groups ( - 0.30 per methoxyl ) , the figure 15 appears high , although it is not exactly known how the phenolic hydroxyl groups are distributed between end and chain ( C5-substituted ) units . The head-to-head , as well as the tail-to-tail , linkages act as bonds between the primary chains in the lignin molecule and may consequently be properly designated as cross-linkages . Whether a crosslinked polymer exists in the form of molecules of finite size or forms , partially or totally , an infinite network depends largely on the size of the primary chains as well as on the frequency of cross-linked units ( 61 ) . As far as lignin in situ is concerned , our present knowledge of these two characteristics is much too scant to justify any conclusions . Still , as pointed out by Schuerch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the idea of an infinite network ( 168 ) . When carbohydrates are removed from wood by periodate , which is probably a method least likely to cause condensation reactions , the lignin is still insoluble and exhibits limited swelling in good lignin solvents . Similarly , Hiigglund and Johnson ( 94 ) demonstrated that spruce Willstiitter lignin , isolated under mild conditions , can be sulfonated in neutral medium to a product which has the characteristics of a cross-linked polyacid and is water-insoluble despite the presence of highly hydrophilic sulfonic acid groups . All the experimental results mentioned are not inconsistent with the concept that a substantial portion of wood lignin exists in the form of a threedimensionally cross-linked structure that becomes degraded to fragments of finite size by cleaving certain acid-sensitive cross links . The relatively short primary chain length , indicated by the proportionately high amount of end groups , is in accordance with the low-viscosity values found for isolated lignins ( 131,176 ) . The viscosity-concentration relationship of isolated ethanol lignins  | indicates extensive branching ( high k ' - values ) ( 168 ) ; this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branched fragments cleaved from an originally cross-linked polymer . Some of the molecular weights of lignin preparations recorded in the literature are given in Table V. It may be observed that although figure most of the isolated lignins represent oligomeric substances of low molecular weight , the preparations that have suffered little degradation during isolation , such as Bjorkman lignin or lignosulfonic acids , possess high molecular weights . The question of ' the existence of lignin-carbohydrate bonds is still largely problematic . The solubilization of the so-called " solid lignosulfonic acid " in acid hydrolysis was earlier frequently cited as convincing evidence for the presence of such links in wood . Later investigations have revealed , however , that the solubilization is due to the cleavage of internal bonds iii lignin itself ( 94 ) . This result , although substantially decreasing the significance of hypothetical lignin-carbohydrate bonds , does not prove their nonexistence . In fact , the isolation of soluble lignin-carbohydrate complexes has been frequently claimed ( 0 ' . 98 ) and it may be significant that their hydrolysis almost invariably yields hemicellulose sugars . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electron micrographs of wood show that lignin is mostly packed in between  | fibrils ( 103 ) . A chemical bond between these constituents is , therefore , improbable even for topochemical reasons . D. FUNCTIONAL , GROUP ANALYSIS The characterization of lignins and lignin derivatives by means of quantitative analytical determinations is often difficult because of poor solubility characteristics and a tendency to undergo secondary reactions . Methoxyl is probably the most characteristic functional group in lignin . The content in softwood protolignin has been estimated to be 15 to 16% ( Table I ) ; hardwood lignins , because of the presence of syringyl propane units , show higher methoxyl contents ( 20.5 to 21.5% ) ( 24a ) . It has been shown that methoxyl is split from lignin by hydriodic acid only at relatively high temperatures ( 66 ) . This indicates that all the methoxyl groups in lignin are probably aromatic and not present in acetal or ester groups . Although positive evidence for the presence of carboxyl groups in spruce lignin has not been obtained , the existence of minor amounts of these groups may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II-A ) , ester groups appear to be present in aspen and grass BM , preparations . The total amount of hydroxyl groups ( including both phenolic and aliphatic hydroxyl groups ) has been determined by dimethyl sulfate methylation ( 25,184 ) and by acetylation ( 78 ) . The drastic conditions of the former method ( concentrated alkali at 60 ? C. ) may cause secondary reactions , such as condensation or partial liberation of phenolic hydroxyl groups ( 146 ) , and tertiary hydroxyl groups may remain unreacted ( 79 ) . By acetylation , Freudenberg has estimated the total hydroxyl contents of spruce BNL and cuproxam lignin to be 1.40 and 1.47 per methoxyl , respectively ( 65 ) . An extensive amount of work has been done lately on the determination of free phenolic groups in lignin and lignin derivatives . The methods used include potentiometric ( 50,63 ) and conductometrie titrations ( 146,161 ) , techniques based on periodate oxidation ( 8 ) , changes in ultraviolet absorption due to the ionization of free phenolic groups ( 17,86 ) , reactions with diazomethane ( 25 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . Each of the methods has certain limitations and difficulties may arise front  | the presence of very weak ( e.g. , sterically hindered or hydrogen bonded ) phenolic hydroxyl groups , the possible existence of carboxylic groups in some preparations , or incomplete solubility of the lignin , etc . Still , the results on Brauns native lignin from spruce by various methods are in good agreement , indicating the presence of 0.5 phenolic hydroxyl group per methoxyl . It is more difficult to estimate the phenolic hydroxyl content of spruce protolignin . For Bjorkman lignin , the values obtained are 0.3 ( 100 ) , 0.33 ( 63 ) , and 0.39 ( 50 ) . Since sulfonation of lignin probably has little effect on the content of phenolic hydroxyl groups , the determined values for lignosulfonic acids should be close to that of original lignin . Individual determinations have given the following values for softwood lignosulfonic acids : 0.2 to 0.3 ( 17 ) , 0.39 ( 50 ) , and 0.32 to 0.43 ( 63 ) phenolic hydroxyl group per methoxyl . For organosolv lignins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the following values have been obtained : 0.36 to 0.39 ( spruce ethanol lignin ) ( 162 ) and 0.41 ( dioxane lignin ) ( 63 ) . Thus , although the present results do not allow a precise evaluation of free phenolic groups in spruce protolignin , a general range of 0.30 to 0.35 phenolic group per methoxyl is clearly indicated . A substantial portion of the aliphatic hydroxyl groups are primary . This is indicated by the isolation of phenylpropane units with primary carbinol groups from hydrogenated lignin cf. structure ( IV ) , Fig. 1 and by the isolation of methoxyacetic acid from the oxidation products of lignin preparations that have been methylated with dimethyl sulfate ( 156 ) . Freudenberg has attempted to determine the primary hydroxyls by using the iodine exchange of tosylated lignin as a measure ; according to him , most of the aliphatic hydroxyl groups are primary ( 62 ) . Of the secondary alcohol groups , those present in position alpha to an unetherified guaiacyl unit have been determined quantitatively . These structures , commonly called " p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol structures " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XLV ) by reaction with quinone imide chloride in alkaline solution ( 82 ) . The indophenol formed may be determined by spectrophotometric methods . The amount of " p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol structures " in lignin and lignin preparations is relatively small : spruce BNL 0.12 to 0.14 , Iijorkman lignin 0.05 to 0.07 , and spruce wood lignin , approximately 0 .03 , expressed as moles per methoxyl ( 83 ) .  | figure p-Hydroxybenzyl alcohols are converted to quinone methides ( XLVI ) by the successive action of hydrobromic acid and sodium bicarbonate ( 12 ) . This reaction has been used for the demonstration of the presence of p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol structures in lignin , but is not suited for their quantitative determination because of the general instability of quinone methides . Quinone methide structures have recently gained interest as possible intermediates in the biogenesis of lignin ( 2 ) . Terminal methyl groups can be determined by the chromic acid oxidation method of Kuhn and 1'Orsa ( 119 ) . Experiments carried out under carefully controlled conditions seem to indicate that lignin contains little or none of these groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lignin is indicated by the infrared spectra ( 107 ) and by the formation of carbonyl derivatives , such as phenylhydrazones ( 44,80 ) and oximes ( 5 ) . Quantitative determinations based on the oxime formation have given 0.12 and 0.10 carbonyl groups per methoxyl for spruce BNL and lignosulfonic acids , respectively ( 5 ) . Recent studies have indicated that these values may be too small because of the incompleteness of the reaction . The determinations based on borohydride reduction ( 84 ) are probably too high , while improved oximation and infrared methods indicate the content of 0.20 carbonyl groups in Bjorkman lignin ( 135a ) . A fraction of the carbonyl groups ( 0.02/OCH3 ) exists in the coniferylaldehyde group of spruce lignin ( 4 ) . Another part ( 0.06/OCR3 ) is located in the alpha position of the side chains in spruce Bjorkman lignin , and can be evaluated from the change in  | light absorption caused by sodium borohydride reduction ( 10 ) . If the higher values for carbonyl contents given in the preceding paragraph are to be considered correct , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The extent of the participation of such carbonyl groups to various lignin reactions is still unknown . Trials to determine the amount of ethylenic linkages , by halogen addition , by reaction with lead tetraacetate , or by catalytic hydrogenation have failed to provide convincing evidence as to the presence of these groups in lignin ( 92c ) . The ultraviolet spectra of lignin derivatives indicate that only small amounts of conjugated double bonds call be present ( 17 ) . Accurate data for the elemental compositions of lignins are lacking . This is owing to the fact that lignin preparations isolated under acidic conditions undergo condensation reactions resulting in loss of water and sometimes contain carbohydrate impurities . Other lignin preparations , although less changed , represent only a part of lignin . The difficulty of calculating the original composition from the analytical data on lignosulfonic acids , lignin thioglycolic acids , or alcohol lignins is due to the incomplete knowledge of the reactions involved in the formation of the lignin derivative . As pointed out by Erdtman ( 57 ) , in the sulfonation of lignin at least two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ether as the reacting groups , are to be considered . figure To obtain the original composition in the former case , SO2 should be subtracted from the lignosulfonic acid formula ; in the latter , one should subtract H2SO3 . Both types of reactions probably occur in the sulfonation of lignin ; until the extent of these reactions is known , the exact evaluation of the original composition is not possible . Table VI presents some of the compositions of lignin preparations reported in the literature , on a phenylpropane unit basis . In the case of a lignin derivative , such as lignosulfonic acid , the calculation has been based on the arbitrary assumption that only one type of reaction lakes place in the formation of the derivative . The detailed formulas for cuproxam , Brazens native , and Bjorkman lignins are based on ; ipproxitnative determinations and have , therefore , only an orienting significance .  | figure E. CONIFE1YL ALDEHYDE GROUPS Coniferyl aldehyde ( XLVII ) ( Fig. 5 ) is only a minor component of lignin , estimated to be present in amounts of 0.020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 4 ) . Free coniferyl aldehyde has repeatedly been isolated from acidic hydrolysis products of wood lignin and BNL preparations ( 5,41,87 ) . . It has been convincingly demonstrated that most of the characteristic color reactions , such as reactions with different phenols , aromatic amines , concentrated hydrochloric acid , etc. , can be ascribed to these groups ( a , 1 12 , 151 ) . The colored compound formed by the action of phenols has probably the structure XLIX . Exhaust ively dinzoiuethnne-  | methylated lignins do not give color reactions ( 25 ) ; this is due to the formation of pyrazoline derivatives , such as structure L ( 118 ) . The coniferyl aldehyde group is easily and reversibly sulfonated ; the sulfonic acid is reconverted to the original aldehyde by the action of cold alkali ( 4 ) . By boiling with 0.1N alkali , coniferyl aldehyde groups in wood and in lignosulfonic acids are hydrolyzed to vanillin ( LI ) and acetaldehyde by reversed aldol condensation ( 188 ) ; both compounds have been isolated from the alkaline hydrolysis products in amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 ) . Ti 24 - sodium hydroxide ( instead of 0 . I.V alkali ) is used in  | hydrolysis , lignosulfonic acids , but not wood lignin , give ; to 4 t ivies more vanillin and acetaldehyde ( 0.07 to 0.11 molejmethoxyl ) than would be expected on the basis of the determined coniferyl aldehyde groups ( 7 ) . It has been suggested that lignosulfonic acids may contain structures that are transformed to coniferyl aldehyde groups by the action of strong alkali ( " masked coniferyl aldehyde groups " . ) III . Physical Properties In wood , lignin is located chiefly in the middle lamella , the amount gradually diminishing towards the lumina of the cells . According to Bailey ( 19,20 ) , the middle lamella of Douglas-fir wood consists of roughly 71% of lignin and 14% of pentosans . The high refractive index of lignin in wood , 1. ( il , as well as the ultraviolet absorption spectrum ( 121 ) , are consistent with its aromatic nature . The diffuse x-ray diffraction pattern shows that wood lignin is amorphous ; still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limited degree of orientation ( 121 ) , The optical inactivity of lignin is noteworthy iar respect to the proposed structural elements that possess asymmetric carbon atoms . In the ultraviolet absorption spectra of lignin and its derivatives ( Fig. 6 ) the absorptivities of the various structural elements are superimposed on each other . The general similarities of lignin spectra to those of pyrocatechol derivatives and , irr the ease of hardwood lignins , also of pyrogallol compounds , were recognized at an early ( late ( 101 ) . Much valuable comparative work on the spectra of lignin derivatives and of guaiacyl model compounds has been done by Aulin-Erdtman ( 15,17 ) . When lignin undergoes a reaction , the changes in molar absorptivities ( on a methoxyl basis ) , plotted against wavelength to form what is called a " difference spectrum , " can give important information on the nature and extent of lignin reactions . The ionization of phenolic groups in alkaline solution causes a characteristic change in the ultraviolet spectrum that has been applied in the determination of these groups ( 17,86 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclei in lignosulfonic acids can he evaluated from the change in spectrum caused by the ionization of this group in strong sulfuric acid solution ( 86 ) . Changes that occur in the contents of alpha-carbonyl or conjugated ethylenie groups , when lignin under-  | figure goes various reactions , often may be followed by means of difference spectra between reacted and original samples ( 10,15,16,17,162 ) . The absorption bands in infrared spectra of lignins ( Fig. 7 ) are considered to he due to the presence of aromatic rings , saturated aliphatic groups , hydroxyl groups , and small amounts of carbonyl groups ( 107 ) . Infrared spectra have played an important role in establishing structural relationships between lignin preparations .  | figure The swelling and solubility characteristics of lignin and its derivatives can be correlated , as demonstrated by Schuerch ( 168 ) , with the inherent properties of the solvent system used . Two factors are operative , namely the solubility parameter after Hildebrand ( 102 ) and the basic strength hydrogen bonding capacity ( 88 ) of the solvent . The ability of solvents to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic strength , and second as their solubility parameters approach a value of about 11 . This can be illustrated by a plot of the solubility parameter versus hydrogen bonding capacity ( Fig. 8 ) , where every solvent system is represented by a single point . Only solvent systems that lie inside a characteristic parabolic area are able to dissolve a given lignin preparation completely . Generally , lower molecular weight lignin fractions are soluble in solvents with a wider range of solubility parameters and hydrogen bonding capacities than are the higher fractions . As an example of the above rule acetone , dioxane , and pyridine , all known to be good lignin solvents , have 6-values between 10.0 and 10.7 and high hydrogen bonding capacities . High yields of organosoly lignins , when aqueous dioxane ( 47 ) or phenol ( 36 ) ( S = 11 ) are used as solvents , are undoubtedly due to the good solvent . power of t Best , systems . Methanol and ethanol are not especially good lignin solvents  | and are unable to dissolve higher molecular weight lignin fragments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless a good solvent system is used ( 167 ) , are mainly due to this factor and not as much to condensation reactions , as assumed earlier . // Hydrogen bonding capacity ( x 10 ? 2 ) figure IV . Reactions of Lignin A. SULFON ATION In the commercially important sulfite pulping process , lignin present in wood chips is converted into soluble lignosulfonic acids by the action of bisulfites and free sulfurous acid at 135 to 140 ? C. Apart from its technical importance , sulfonation also represents one of the most theoretically interesting lignin reactions . The evaluation of the mechanism of sulfonation and of the nature of the reactive groups involved has been complicated by the fact that snlfoiic acid groups are introduced into a large variety of organic compounds tinder conditions similar to the sulfite process . As a result , a number of speculative mechanisms have been proposed for review , see ( 92b ) . The presentation which follows is limited to a discussion of the sulfonation theory developed by the Swedish school  | of lignin chemists ( cf. 130 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is based on a substantial amount of experimental material and in principle is consistent with the complicated phenomena observed in lignin sulfonation . ( See also Chapter 10 . ) According to the kinetics of sulfonation in neutral and acidic media , the reacting groups in spruce lignin arc divided into three groups , the so-called X- , Z- , and B-groups ( 54,128,138 ) . The structures assigned to these groups are given in Fig. 9 ( 21,128 ) . When the sulfonation is carried out in neutral or slightly acidic solution , only X- and Z-groups ( collective designation : " A-groups " ) ( 54 ) react to form sulfonic acids ( LII ) and ( LIII ) ( 130 ) , whereas the B-groups remain intact . Both X- and Z-groups are present in approximate amounts of 0.15 per methoxyl ; the former reacts very rapidly because of the activating influence of a free phenolic hydroxyl group . The major product , so-called " solid lignosulfonic acid " ( 95 ) , accordingly contains about 0.3 sulfonic acid group per methoxyl . Since very few linkages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid lignosulfonic acid is still in the form of a cross-linked aggregate and is therefore insoluble . By acid hydrolysis the benzyl ether cross linkages present in group B are broken and the lignin molecule split into soluble fragments ; it passes into solution to form what is called " low sulfonated lignosulfonic acids . " A convenient way to perform the hydrolysis is to exchange the cations in the solid lignosulfonic acid for hydrogen ions and heat the resulting material in distilled water ( 120 ) . Simultaneously with the hydrolysis , a reactive group B ' ( 55,125 ) , containing a benzyl alcohol group , is liberated from the originally unreactive structure B ( 129 ) . Group B ' can be further sulfonated ( 57 ) both by neutral ( 125 ) and acidic sulfite solutions . Structures ( LIII ) and ( LIV ) are identical except for possible differences in the C2 groups . Lignosulfonic acids , prepared by this stepwise procedure may contain up to nearly 1 sulfur atom per methoxyl group . However , it has been demonstrated that only 0.6 atom is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mikawa and co-workers ( 137 ) have estimated the amount of B-groups to be roughly 0.3 per methoxyl group . The nature of the nonacidic residue , usually called " excess sulfur " ( 160 ) , is unknown . In the technical sulfite process , the medium is acidic (  | = 1.5 to 2.0 ) from the beginning , and all the above-mentioned reactions occur simultaneously . The final sulfonic acid content is usually less ( aboii  | 0.5 per methoxyl ) than is obtained in the stepwise procedure ; this may , in part , be due to secondary condensation reactions of the reacting groups . Polyphenols , such as resorcinol , pyrogallol , or phloroglucinol , if present in a normal sulfite cook , retard and even inhibit the dissolution of lignosulfonic acid ( 54 ) . This is the reason for difficulties found in pulping the heartwood of pine or Douglas-fir ; the extracts of the former contain pinosylvin ( 3,5-dihydroxystilbene ) and its monomethyl ether ( 54 ) , and those of the latter contain taxifolin ( 3,5,7,3 ' , 4 ' - pentahydroxyflavanone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out in two stages , first with neutral and then with acidic sulfite ( Graham process ) , normal delignification is obtained ( 54 ) . To explain the effect of polyphenols , Erdtman assumed that at pH 1.5 to 2 group A reacts more rapidly with phenols than with bisulfite to form an insoluble condensation product ; in neutral solution the reactivities are reversed . Much smaller amounts of condensed polyphenols 0.17 mole of resorcinol ( 54 ) , or 0.07 mole of phloroglucinol ( 182 ) per lignin methoxyl than nionofunctional ones 0.5 mole per methoxyl ( 182 ) suffice to inhibit the dissolution of most of the lignin in the sulfite process . Probably , the polyphenols condense with two A groups and cause insolubility by cross-linking rather than by blocking the introduction of the hydrophilic sulfonic acid groups . If solid lignosulfonic acid is subjected to ethanolysis , it passes into solution and the product contains ethoxyl groups . These are probably formed by the ethanolysis of benzyl ether linkages in group B B -* ( LVI ) . The fact that the introduced ethoxyl groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sulfonation ( 56 ) is consistent with the mechanism given in Fig. 9 . Group B ' differs from Z by its lower rate of sulfonation . This may be due to differing side-chain structures . It is not impossible that group B ' may have a guaiacylglycerol-13-aryl ether structure ( 9 ) . Lignin thioglycolic acids bear certain similarities to lignosulfonates . They are formed by the action of thioglycolic and hydrochloric acids ( 104 ) , probably mainly from the same reactive groups as lignosulfonic acids . In addition , a part of the hydroxyl groups in lignin forms esters with thioglycolic acid . The evidence for assigning the benzyl alcohol and ether structures , given in Fig. 9 , to the relative groups X , Z , and B in lignin , can In ' shortly summarized as follows :  | Model compounds to X , Z , B , and B ' groups , such as vanillyl and veratryl alcohols ( 127 ) and their ethers ( 128 ) , guaiacylglycerol derivatives ( 9,13,130 ) , pinoresinol , ( 132 ) etc. , show extensive similarities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed mechanisms are in accordance with the fact that the sillfoliation of lignin proceeds practically without effect on the ultraviolet absorption spectrum ( 18,122 ) , and that the phenolic content is claimed to remain practically unchanged in sulfonation ( 15,156 ) and in the formation of lignin thioglycolic acids ( 131 ) . Of the postulated X groups , those with unetherified alpha hydroxyls ( 13 , = H ) have been positively identified in protolignin and their high reactivity in sulfonation has been similarly demonstrated ( 83 ) . In the further sulfonation of low-sulfonated lignosulfonic acids , the sulfonic acid groups are introduced in equivalent amounts to the loss in total hydroxyl content ( 57 ) ; this is consistent with the benzyl alcohol structure assigned to the B ' groups . The kinetics of dissolution of lignin in the sulfite process have been the subject of numerous studies . Two separate chemical processes are obviously involved , the introduction of hydrophilic sulfonic acid groups on one hand , and the hydrolytic cleavage of the acid-sensitive linkages on the other . The process which will become ratedetermining appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the technical sulfite process , the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly owing to the acidity of the medium , and consequently , as demonstrated by Corey and Maass ( 37 ) , the dissolution rate is mainly controlled by the rate of sulfonation . The lignosulfonic acids , after being dissolved in the cooking liquor , are hydrolyzed further and the molecular weight is decreased ( 59 ) . A reduction in the average molecular weight from about 14,000 to ( i3O00 has been observed ( 142 ) . During prolonged heating , the molecular weight reaches a minimum after which an increasing trend is  | observed , probably due to acid-catalyzed condensation reactions ( 142 ) . B. ALCOIIOLYSIS Protolignin and various lignin preparations undergo a number of reactions when treated with various alcohols in the presence of mineral acids . Some of these reactions take place even at room temperature . For instance , when spruce Bjorkman lignin reacted with a mixture of methanol and dioxane containing anhydrous hydrochloric acid ( 0.15N ) and the reaction product was recovered by precipitation into petroleum ether , it was found that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group per original methoxyl ( 2 ) . Three reactions have been considered as possible causes of the observed introductions of alkoxyl groups : ( 1 ) Acetalization of carbonyl groups ( 26 ) ; ( 2 ) etherification of enol groups ; and ( 3 ) etherification of alpha-hydroxy or alpha-ether structures ( 5 ) . Studies on lignin preparations , in which the carbonyl groups were first eliminated by sodium borohydride reduction , indicate the last reaction to be the predominant one accounting for most of the methoxyl groups introduced in cold methanolysis ( 0.42 or more ) ( 2 ) . figure The reaction showing the formation of ( LXI ) is in accordance with the known behavior of a member of model compounds ( 2 ) , and is fully consistent with the proposed mechanism for the ethanolysis of the solid lignosulfonic acid , as discussed in the previous section . Lignin in wood does not become soluble in cold alcoholysis . At an elevated temperature , however , most of the lignin is dissolved , especially if a proper solvent medium is used . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 166 ) that follows the rapid initial alkoxylation reaction . The increased content of phenolic hydroxyl groups indicates that phenol ether linkages are cleaved in this reaction ( 162 ) . A part of lignin becomes converted to the monomeric state ( 190 ) . In their extensive studies on the ethanolysis of spruce lignin , Hibbert and co-workers were able to isolate and identify the monomeric guaiacyl-derivatives ( LXVIII ) , ( LXIX ) , ( LXX ) , and ( LXXI ) ( Fig. 10 ) , in amounts corresponding to about 10% of the figure  | original lignin ( 190 ) . Maple lignin gave , in addition to the guaiacyl derivatives , the syringyl derivatives corresponding to ( LXIX ) , ( LXX ) , and ( LXXI ) , and the total yield of monomeric products was higher ( 20% of original lignin ) ( 29 ) . The same compounds can also be isolated from the ethanolysis products of BNL preparations and of lignosulfonic acids ( 116 ) . As convincingly demonstrated by Hibbert , ethanolysis products ( LXVIII ) to ( LXX " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but are formed by a series of rearrangement reactions from a common progenitor which does not contain a terminal methyl group . He assumed that the progenitor has the structure of 0-oxyconiferyl alcohol ( LXIV ) or its keto form ( LXV ) ( 60 ) . Compound ( I , XV ) has been synthesized by Gardner ( 81 ) , who also demonstrated the expected conversion of this compound to products ( LXVIII ) , ( LXIX ) , ( LXX ) , and ( I , XXI ) on ethanolysis . However , it has been shown that guaiacylglycerol ( LXII ) also gives the same products on ethanolysis ( 13 ) . Since the guaiacylglycerol structure is in better conformity with other lignin reactions and with the current : ideas on the structure of lignin , it almost certainly represents the progenitor of ethanolysis monomers . The majority of guaiacylglycerol units in lignin are probably bound bifmictionally through C4 and Co-alkyl-aryl ether linkages ; a benzyl ether cross-linkage may be present also e.g. , see structure ( LXXII ) . figure This mode of combination is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups ( 96 ) , and since 1,2-glycol groups seem to be practically absent in lignin ( 133 ) . It has also been demonstrated that the 0-alkyl-aryl ether linkages in model compounds , similar to structure ( I , CXII ) , can be cleaved by ethanolysis ( 13 , 130 ) .  | Recent evidence points out that **25;702;TOOLONG structures may be present in protolignin in much larger amounts than indicated by the yields of ethanolysis monomers . The reason these groups are not quantitatively transformed to the monomeric state seems to lie in the fact that part of guaiacylglycerol groups are bound by resistant alkyl-aryl ether linkages ( 162 ) or by C5-carbon linkages to other lignin units . Recent results on the re-ethanolysis of ethanol lignins ( 162 ) , as well as on the methanolysis of Bjorkman lignin ( 11 ) , indicate that all phenolic groups liberated during alcoholysis originate from guaiacylglycerol- ( 3-aryl ether structures . On this basis , monomers present in guaiacylglycerol structures may approximate 30% in spruce lignin ( 11 ) . The change in ultraviolet spectrum during alcoholysis is mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the reactions resulting in the formation of phenolic groups and side-chain rearrangements , condensation reactions take place causing a decrease in oxygen content ( 162 ) . C. ACIDIC HYDROLYSIS When heated in mildly acidic aqueous media , wood lignins undergo a hydrolytic degradation which appears to be analogous to the degradation reaction in alcoholysis . Bjorkman lignin , hydrolyzed in a dioxane ? water mixture with a mineral acid catalyst , yields small amounts of guaiacylacetone ( LXVIII ) , vanilloyl methyl ketone ( LXXI ) , and the ketol ( LXVII ) ( 11 ) . Ketones ( LXVIII ) and ( LXXI ) , together with coniferyl aldehyde , cumaraldehyde , and vanillin , also were isolated , when Douglas-fir wood and the BNL preparations from the same wood were heated in distilled water at 170 ? C. ( 87 ) . Of the compounds isolated , ketones ( LXVIII ) and ( LXXI ) are identical with those isolated from the ethanolysis reaction , and I , XVII ) corresponds to an intermediate that is converted to its ethyl ether in ethanolysis ( cf. Fig. 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolated compounds are formed from a guaiacylglycerol-/3-aryl ether structure in the original lignin . The analogous course of alcoholysis and hydrolysis reactions is further supported by t he fact that in both reactions the end-methyl content of lignin is increased , probably due to the side-chain rearrangement of guaiacylglycerol units ( I I ) .  | There is , however , an important difference between the two reactions . Whereas substantial amounts of monomeric products are isolated from ethanolysis , the hydrolysis yields only traces of such products . This is probably due to the tendency of alpha hydroxyl groups and of ketol structures to undergo condensation reactions under acidic conditions , especially with the aromatic rings of units containing a free phenolic hydroxyl group . Such condensation reactions are effectively suppressed in the alcoholysis through the etherification of the reactive alpha hydroxyl groups and ketol structures . The condensation reactions appear , indeed , to predominate under the conditions of acidic hydrolysis , and usually completely overshadow the effects of hydrolytic degradation . Especially sensitive are the p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol groups that are destroyed by a mild acid treatment at room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation of acid lignins , such as I ( lason and Willst after lignins , are reflected in the decreased oxygen contents of these preparations . Heating wood meal in distilled water at temperatures ranging from 100 ? to 200 ? C. , which may be considered equivalent to a mild acid hydrolysis , progressively decreases the yield of vanillin in nitrobenzene oxidation ( 117 ) , and the lignin loses its thermoplastic properties as well as the capacity to dissolve in the sulfite process ( 37 ) . No such changes are observed when wood is heated in the dry state . Some condensation occurs in the sulfite pulping process , as mentioned earlier in this chapter . The reaction is not extensive because of the blocking action of the sulfonic acid groups . Under abnormal conditions , i.e. , when incomplete sulfonation is combined with a high local acidity , condensation reactions can completely inhibit the dissolution of lignin . The condensing groups in lignin probably include the coniferylaldehyde groups in addition to the alpha hydroxyl groups . Both intra- and intermolecular condensations may occur . Metahemipinic acid that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lignins may be derived from an intramolecularly condensed structure ( 15(i) . The tendency of lignin to undergo intermolecular condensation reactions perhaps is illustrated best by the fact that it readily condenses with various monomeric phenols ( 33 ) . The degradative action of aqueous acids on the carbon-to-carbon linkages of lignin is apparently slight , except when concentrated mineral acids are used . Treatment of lignin with 28% sulfuric acid  | produces formaldehyde in a yield of 1.5 to 2.0% of the weight of the lignin ( 75 ) . The formaldehyde isolated from a y-labeled radioactive lignin has been shown to be radioactive , indicating that the cleavage of a /3  --  y linkage is involved in its formation ( 67 ) . D. ALKALINE HYDROLYSIS As mentioned earlier , heating of lignin with alkaline solutions causes the splitting of alkyl-aryl ether linkages in the position 4 , with the formation of phenolic hydroxyl groups . Such reactions have also been demonstrated with guaiacyl ether model compounds ( 123 ) . Cleavage reactions occur in lignosulfonic acids even at temperatures below 100 ? C. , with simultaneous decreases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups in lignin , a temperature range between 160 to 170 ? C. has been used most frequently ( 74 ) . The ether linkage present in the methoxyl group is more stable and is degraded at temperatures above 250 ? C. ; protocatechuic acid and pyrocatechol have been isolated from such products . The carbon-to-carbon linkages in lignin also are susceptible to alkaline media . The formation of vanillin and acetaldehyde from coniferyl aldehyde groups already was mentioned . Indications also exist that linkages between ( 3- and 7-carbon atoms of propyl sidechains may likewise become partially degraded . Maple wood lignin , when hydrogenated with Raney nickel catalyst at 160 to 170 ? C. in a neutral medium , gives products from which monomeric syringyl- and guaiacylpropane derivatives can be isolated ( 28 ) . When a medium containing 3% of sodium hydroxide is used , only monomeric phenylethane derivatives ( LXXIII ) , ( LXXIV ) , and ( LXXV ) are isolated ( 149 ) . It therefore appears probable that the alkaline medium causes a cleavage between the 13- and y-carbon atoms . Furthermore , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and formaldehyde ( 113 ) among the alkaline hydrolysis products of spruce lignosulfouates suggests a cleavage of a 0 ? 7 carbon linkage . Cuproxam lignin gives 2 to 3% of formaldehyde by boiling with dilute alkali ( 75 ) .  | A large part of wood lignin becomes alkali-soluble when heated to 1 ( 10 ? C. with aqueous alkali , owing to the degradation processes mentioned . The delignification by alkali finds commercial use in the soda process , a pulping method applicable to hardwood species . The soda process , as such , is not an effective pulping process for softwoods . The reason probably lies in the extensive condensation of softwood lignin under the conditions used . The condensation reactions in the soda process quite probably are extensive and cause the formation of new carbon-to-carbon bonds between monomeric units . Adkins and co-workers ( 1 ) were able to demonstrate convincingly the effect of these reactions on aspen lignin . They found that aspen soda lignin fails to yield a monomeric fraction on hydrogenolysis , whereas the methanol lignin from the same wood is converted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kraft pulping process is essentially a modification of the soda process in which a part of the sodium hydroxide base is replaced by sodium sulfide . Because of its applicability to resinous softwoods , among other factors , more pulps are presently being manufactured by the kraft process than by the sulfite pulping process . In comparison with the soda process , the rate of delignification in the kraft process is more rapid and the obtained pulps contain less lignin . Both of these effects are believed to be due to less condensation in the latter process . It has been proposed that the HS ? ions react with a part of the condensing groups , thus inhibiting the condensation reactions ( 49 ) . This view has gained support from studies on model compounds ( 52 ) . These studies indicate that unetherified guaiacylpropane units , containing a hydroxyl or an alkyl ether group in the alpha-position ( LXXVII ) , may react with hydrosulfide anion , forming a mercaptan ( LXXVIII ) .  | According to Enkvist ( 49 ) an increasing number of the above structures becomes available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hydrolyzed by the action of alkali . The protective action of the mercaptan groups appears to be only temporary , retarding rather than inhibiting the condensation reaction . Kraft lignin , which can be precipitated from the kraft liquors by acidification , is an ill-defined substance containing from 2 to 4% of sulfur . It is of relatively low molecular weight and contains substantial amounts of free phenolic groups . These are formed in the alkaline cleavage of the original phenolic ether bonds , and the cleavage reaction appears to go to completion during the process . In addition , a part of the methoxyl groups is hydrolyzed and converted to methanol and dimethyl sulfide . ( See also Chapter 10 . ) F. HALOGENATION The commercial pulping methods generally are based on delignification processes which require relatively high temperatures . There exists , however , a number of chemical agents capable of accomplishing delignification at much lower temperatures . Of these , chlorine in acidic solution converts lignin to a derivative , chlorolignin , which is extractable with aqueous alkali . The well-known Cross and Bevan. ( cf. 32b @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the delignifying action of chlorine . Moist wood meal , or any other plant material , is treated at room temperature with gaseous chlorine and the chlorinated lignin is extracted with alkali . Repetition of the treatment a few times produces a virtually lignin-free material , with little if any hydrolytic degradation of the cellulosic components . To a limited degree , chlorination followed by alkali extraction is used as a commercial pulping method to produce straw pulps Pomilio ( 153 ) and deVains ( 43 ) processes . In wood pulp industries , chlorine represents the most important bleaching chemical . The action of chlorine on sulfite and kraft pulps is dependent on the pH of the medium . Acidic chlorine water , which is used in the first stage of the commercial bleaching process , acts as a delignifying agent and converts most of the residual lignin in pulps to a water- and alkali-soluble form . Alkaline hypochlorite , used in the final stage of the bleaching process , is distinctively different from chlorine water in its action and  | may be properly characterized as a bleaching rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mechanism of acidic chlorination indicate that the following three reactions dominate the early phases of chlorine treatment : 1 . Chlorine substitution at the aromatic nucleus , predominantly at position 6 ( LXXIX ) ( LXXX ) . 2 . Electrophilic displacement of the side-chain ( LXXXI ) , facilitated by the presence of an alpha hydroxyl or alkyl ether group . 3 . Chlorine-catalyzed hydrolysis of aromatic ether groups , resulting in the liberation of methanol and , presumably , in the cleavage of phenol ether linkages ( LXXXII ) . figure Of the reactions mentioned , the electrophilic displacement and the hydrolysis of phenol ether bonds effectively reduce the size of the lignin molecule making it more soluble , even if they take place only in a part of the phenylpropane units . The creation of new hydrophilic groups by the hydrolysis reaction makes a further contribution toward increased solubility . Because of other accompanying reactions , such as further chlorine substitution , oxidation to quinoiies , etc. , the chlorolignins , although of relatively small molecular weight , represent complicated mixtures of various products . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium ,  | such as glacial acetic acid , the hydrolysis of phenol ethers is inhibited . Tetrachloroguaiacol ( LXXXIV ) has been isolated from the chlorination of spruce wood lignin in glacial acetic acid ( 42 ) . It probably is formed from the free guaiacol end groups in lignin . G. NITRATION As early as 1849 , the French chemist Anselme Payen found that lignin could be removed from plant materials by treating them with concentrated nitric acid and by extracting the nitrated material with alkali and organic solvents ( 144 ) . Subsequently , nitration of wood meal has sometimes been used as a quantitative method to determine the carbohydrate constituents ( 32c ) . To a limited degree , industrial pulps from straw are prepared by the nitration method . Likewise , dissolving pulps from hardwoods can be produced , although the method , as yet , has not proven to be competitive with the more common pulping processes . The nitration of wood resembles the chlorination reaction in that the lignin is converted to a soluble form under relatively mild conditions which do not appreciably affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a formal one . Electrophilic side-chain replacement by a nitro group has been shown to occur in the nitration of a number of guaiacyl derivatives ( 56,91 ) . A product of such a reaction , the 2,4-dinitroguaiacol , has been isolated on nitrating spruce wood meal in ethyl ether , and is apparently derived from a free guaiacyl end group in lignin ( 91 ) . Furthermore , aromatic methyl ethers generally suffer partial demethylation on nitration . Both a loss in methoxyl content as well as the formation of methanol have been observed on the nitration of lignin ( 68 ) . Owing to various reactions a part of the nitric acid becomes reduced to nitrogen oxides , ammonia , and even to hydrogen cyanide ( 159 ) . Since these reduction products may , in part , react with lignin and its degradation products , the chemical characterization of nitrolignins is a rather difficult task . H. REACTIONS WITH CHLORINE DIOXIDE AND CHLORITES The delignifying action of chlorine dioxide was discovered by Schmidt ( 163 ) who demonstrated that lignin can be removed from wood meal by treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low as room temperature , followed by an extraction with sodium sulfite or a base . Similar action is exerted by a slightly acidified sodium chlorite solution , and the chlorine dioxide generated from the chlorite is probably the principal agent causing the delignification reaction . The carbohydrate components undergo relatively little oxidation or degradation in the process . Consequently , methods based on the use of chlorine dioxide are widely utilized for the isolation or quantitative determination of holocellulose ( 32a ) . In recent times , chlorine dioxide has gained increasing use as a bleaching agent , especially for kraft pulps . Brighter pulps with less cellulose degradation are obtained if chlorine dioxide instead of hypochlorite is used as a final stage of the commercial bleaching process . The chemistry of deliguification and bleaching reactions by chlorine dioxide is incompletely known . In general , chlorine dioxide is a weak oxidant and reacts very sluggishly with saturated aliphatic compounds . It is reactive towards unsaturated compounds , with the exception of a , ( 3-unsaturated carboxylic acids , and reacts very rapidly with phenols , many of which give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . This suggests that the aromatic nuclei of lignin , rather than the side chains , are primarily attacked and degraded by chlorine dioxide . The isolation of 6-chlorovanillin and 6-chlorovanillic acid from the nitrobenzene oxidation products of chlorite lignin demonstrates the occurrence of chlorine substitution reactions ( 106 ) . The oxidative degradation may , however , proceed without an intermediate chlorine substitution . This is suggested by the fact that vanillin ( XXV ) , on chlorine dioxide oxidation , is converted in 25% yield to a chlorinefree , crystalline compound ( 105 ) , later identified as 0-formyl muconic acid monomethyl ester ( 109 ) . Chlorine dioxide , as well as sodium chlorite , also causes a ring open ing in vanillyl alcohol ( 42b ) . In addition , various quinone compounds and methanol are formed .  | Investigations made on the chlorine dioxide and chlorite oxidations of wood lignin ( 20b,126b ) and lignosulfonates ( 175 ) indicate substantial degradation of aromatic nuclei , judging from the disappearance of the characteristic 280 m , u. maximum in the UV-spectrum . However , the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring opening and other degradation reactions are involved . I. VARIOUS ORCANOSOLV LIGNINS A large variety of so-called organosoly lignins has been prepared by treating plant materials ( generally in the presence of small amounts of mineral acid , but also in slightly alkaline or even neutral solutions ) with different solvents , such as ethylene glycol ( 90 ) , dioxane ( 47 ) , glycol chlorohydrin ( 169 ) , aqueous butanol ( 20 ) , phenol ( 36 ) , thiophenol ( 27 ) , acetic and formic acids ( 75,170 ) , ethanolamine ( 192 ) , etc . The nature of these products as well as the reactions involved in their preparation are incompletely known . Among the organosoly lignins , the phenol lignins have certain interesting characteristics . Wood , heated with ordinary phenol containing 0.2% of hydrogen chloride at 90 to 100 ? C. , is almost completely delignified in 0.5 to 1 hour ( 33 ) . The resulting phenol lignin contains a substantial amount of phenol in a condensed form and the analytical composition agrees with the approximate formula **27;729;TOOLONG ? 3C6HSOH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between lignin and the p-position of the phenol . However , at least a partial condensation to the o-position is indicated by the isolation of salicylic acid from the nitrobenzene oxidation products ( 186 ) . Condensation between wood lignin and phenols under the action of mineral acids occurs even in the cold ; the condensation product , however , does not become soluble . As the condensation proceeds , yields of vanillin in nitrobenzene oxidation are gradually decreased from 26 to 10% of the weight of lignin ( 140 ) . As mentioned earlier , wood lignin condensed with phenols can not be dissolved in the sulfite process , probably because the groups reacting in sulfonation may be ide ) 1ieal with those condensing with phenols.  | V. Biogenesis of Lignin At an early stage of lignin research , Mason ( 110 ) , as well as Tiemann and Haarmann ( 181 ) , expressed the opinion that sprucewood lignin may be formed in nature from coniferin ( LXXXVI ) , a glucosidic compound present in the cambial sap . Later Erdtman ( 53 ) suggested that the biogenesis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( LXXXVII ) which , by the action of mushroom enzymes , is converted into diisoeugenol In essence , these early views have been confirmed by recent biochemical studies , especially by Freudenberg ( 62-80 ) . It is now generally believed that spruce lignin is formed in nature from coniferin by enzymatic hydrolysis of the glucosidic bond and subsequent dehydrogenative polymerization of the liberated coniferyl alcohol , although the latter process appears to be much more complex than the dimerization of isoeugenol . Freudenberg ( 67 ) was the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of radioactively-labeled n-coniferin as the biological precursor of lignin . When this compound is administered to young spruce buds , the radioactivity can later on be quantitatively recovered in the lignin fraction ( 67,114 ) . The monomers isolated from the ethanolysis products of such lignin proved to he strongly radioactive ; see Freudenberg ( 63 ) and Kratzl ( 114 ) . Likewise , Wacek ( 187 ) has demonstrated that phloem cultures do not become lignified unless n-coniferin is added to the culture medium . The D-glucosidase needed for the hydrolysis of D-coniferin has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be present in the cambium cells , which are in an active state of lignification , by the blue color that developed when micro-tome sections of spruce wood were I rented  | with indican solution . In conjunction with the primary role assigned to this enzyme is the discovery that radioactive L-coniferin does not become incorporated in lignin ( 67 ) . Apparently the liberated coniferyl alcohol becomes subject to the dehydrogenative action of an enzyme , lactase , present in the cambial sap and is converted into an insoluble lignin which is deposited in the middle lamella and in the cell walls . To study this process in detail , Freudenberg has performed numerous in vitro experiments . Coniferyl alcohol was subjected to the combined action of air-oxygen and of either mushroom or cambial sap enzymes in aqueous solution at room temperature , preferably at a pH range between 5.5 and 6.5 . Under these conditions coniferyl alcohol is slowly converted to a waterinsoluble , light-colored , amorphous polymerizate called " dehydrogenation polymerizate " ( dehydrierungspolymerisat , DHP ) . DHP shows extensive similarities to spruce protolignin and BNL preparations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , optical inactivity , color reactions , amount of liberated formaldehyde by the action of mineral acids , formation of isohemipinic acid , amount and nature of hydroxyl groups , formation and composition of sulfonic acids , thermoplasticity ( in both cases lost by boiling with dilute mineral acids ) , infrared spectra of the preparations , as well as their methylated and sulfonated derivatives , etc . The same monomeric ethanolysis products can be isolated from DHP as from spruce lignin . DHP differs from BNL by its somewhat higher methoxyl content ( 1.00 instead of 0.92 methoxyl group per guaiacylpropane unit ) , higher content of coniferyl aldehyde groups , and by a somewhat different ultraviolet spectrum . Dehydrogenation polymerizates also p 300 have been prepared from radioactive coniferyl alcohols , labeled both in 0- and y-positions by carbon-14 ( 67 ) . From the products formed in the early stages of I ) HP formation , Freudenberg and co-workers ( 71 ) have been able to isolate coniferyl aldehyde ( LXXXIX ) , dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol ( XC ) , v , Lpinoresinol ( XCI ) , **28;758;TOOLONG ether ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unidentified products ( 71 ) . It is especially significant that the same compounds have been found to be present , in small amounts , in the acetone extract of the cambial layer of spruce wood ( 63 ) . Furthermore , many of the structural elements postulated for spruce protolignin on the basis of chemical evidence are represented in these compounds , such as coniferyl aldehyde ( LXXXIX ) and guaiacylglycerol-$-aryl ether ( XCII ) structures , as well as 0-5 ' ( XC ) and 0- ( 3 ' ( XCI ) carbon linkages and alpha-alkyl ether groups ( XCI ) . Freudenberg assumes that the enzymatic action in DHP formation , as well as in lignin biosynthesis , is limited to the extraction of a hydrogen atom from the phenolic hydroxyl group in coniferyl alcohol . Such interpretation is consistent with the optical inactivity of lignin . One of the possibilities to be considered for the formation of the above-mentioned dimers is the recombination of the various resonating structures of the coniferyl alcohol radical . figure For instance , **28;788;TOOLONG ether ( XCII ) can be visualized as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XCVI ) and ( XCIII ) , followed by the stabilization of the quinone methide group in ( XCVII ) by addition of water . In a similar fashion , dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol ( XC ) could be fonned from resonance structures ( XCIV ) and ( XCVI ) , and DO , - 117COI I figure pinoresinol , ( XCI ) , from two molecules of ( XCVI ) . In the former case , the intermediate quillone methide structure would be stabilized by an intramolecular addition of a phenolic hydroxyl group , whereas  | in the latter instance two such structures would add gamma-hydroxyl groups . The suggested addition reactions are consistent with the general behavior of quinone methides ( XCIX ) which are known to be extremely reactive and easily undergo hydrolysis , alcoholysis , or dimerization ( 2 ) . Considering the high reactivity of quinone methides , it seems feasible that the addition reactions leading to the formation of the dimers ( XC ) , ( XCI ) and ( XCII ) may not be the only reactions occurring . To illustrate this , let us assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding one molecule of water , undergoes reaction with an alcoholic hydroxyl ( for instance , with the primary carbinol group of a coniferyl alcohol molecule ) . In this reaction , an alkyl-ether link would form between two monomeric units ( 2 ) , e.g. , ( CIII ) . figure An analogous reaction between the quinone methide and a hydroxyl group belonging to a carbohydrate molecule would result in the formation of a " lignin-carbohydrate bond " ( 64 ) . Finally , a reaction between two quinone methides would form a stilbene-like arrangement , and thereby form a carbon-to-carbon linkage between the alpha carbon atoms of two monomeric units . It thus can be seen that the addition reactions of the dimeric quinone methide intermediates can potentially result in the formation of either one of the three lignin dimers , of a lignin-carbohydrate bond , or a lignin trimer in which the third unit is linked by an alpha-alkyl ether or a-a ' carbon-to-carbon bond . Iii addition to the isolated dimers ( XC ) , ( XCI ) , and ( XCII ) the presence of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would readily form by recombination of two resonance structures ( XCIV ) : figure Although it has not been possible , as yet , to demonstrate the presence of dime ' . ( CIV ) in the cambial sap of spruce wood , its participation in the polymerization of coniferyl alcohol in the biological formation of lignin appears likely . It is obvious that continuing dehydrogenation processes , combined with the various radical recombination reactions and additions to the quinone methide intermediates , will result in further polymerization to aggregates of high molecular weight . Consequently , no further assumptions are necessary to describe the polymerization of coniferyl alcohol in spruce wood to high molecular weight lignin . If it is assumed that all the previously discussed radical recombination and addition reactions take place to varying degrees during the polymerization process , the lignin molecule should be a random polymer in which the phenylpropane units are connected by 13-4 ' and a-alkyl ether linkages , as well as by 0-5 ' , /3-O ' , a-a ' , and 5-5 ' carbon-to-carbon linkages . This is an exactly identical structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence , as discussed earlier in this chapter . The agreement of two independent approaches to the same structural problem is indeed remarkable , and adds to the confidence with which the present ideas about the structure of lignin can be accepted . Provision should be made , of course , for possible further modifications and refinements of these concepts which may result from future biogenetic and chemical studies . As the concept of coniferyl alcohol as the precursor of softwood lignin appears well-established , one would expect coniferyl alcohol , ogether with the corresponding syringyl derivative ( sinapyl alcohol ) o play similar roles in the formation of hardwood lignin . Syringin ( CV ) , the glucoside of sinapyl alcohol , has been shown to be present in the bark of many plants , mainly belonging to the family Oleasene . Ilowever , the biogenesis of hardwood lignin still seems unclear .  | figure Although the lignifying cells of many hardwoods give a blue color with indican solution , indicating the presence of d-glucosidase , the reaction is absent in some species ( 77 ) . Sinapyl alcohol shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pinoresinol . By the action of mushroom enzymes , it is transformed to watersoluble dark brown products . If the procedure is applied to a 1:1 mixture of coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols , a light-colored insoluble product , containing both components , is formed ; however , the relationship of this polymer to hardwood protolignin has not been clearly established ( 62 ) . The position of lignin in general plant metabolism has been the subject of numerous studies based on the administration of radioactive compounds to living plants . Brown and Neish have attempted to locate the position of various potential intermediates in the biological sequence of lignin formation in living plants ( 30 ) . The dilution of radioactive carbon was taken as the criterion of efficiency . They were able to show that shikimic acid ( C'VI ) , an intermediate in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids , acts as progenitor of the aromatic nuclei in maple and wheat lignins . Similar results were obtained by Eberhardt and Schubert ( hi ) on sugar cane lignin . They also demonstrated that vanillin , isolated by nitrobenzene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active shikimie acid to a living plant , had the same distribution of radioactivity in the ring carbon atoms as the introduced shikimic acid . In the plant , shikimic acid appears to be formed from glucose via phosphorylated sedoheptulose. p- Ilydroxyphenylpyruvic acid ( CVII ) may possibly act as an intermediate between shikimic acid and phenylpropane derivatives . figure  | syringaldehyde , and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde which were isolated by nitrobenzene oxidation after administering different aromatic compounds to living plants . A variety of pheuylpropane derivatives , such as phenylalanine , tyrosine , and cinnamic acid , proved to be efficient precursors of lignin . In the case of phenylalanine , the radioactivity of the three isolated aldehydes was on an equal level . Ferulic acid ( CV III ) was found to be an especially efficient precursor ; the radioactivity was , however , mainly concentrated in vanillin . Freudenberg ( 6:3 ) has subjected lignins formed ire a plant , after the incorporation of active phenylalanine and ferulic acid , to degradation by ethanolysis . The monomers isolated proved to be highly radioactive , indicating that the carboxyl groups of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seems , therefore , plausible that phenylalanine and ferulic acid may represent actual intermediates in the biological pathway between shikimic acid and lignin , as suggested by Brown and Neish .

Introduction All species of wood and other plant tissues contain small amounts , and in some cases quite appreciable quantities , of substances in addition to cellulose , hemicelluloses , and lignin . To distinguish them from the major cell wall components , these additional constituents are known as the extraneous components . Many of these substances are extractable with neutral solvents , and are referred to as extractives . The term extraneous components embraces a wide range of ' chemical types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , no single species contains all the possible compounds or even all the different classes of compounds . The extractives of related species are often similar , and thus there are many family relationships . On the other hand , the exact nature of the extractives often differs distinctly between closely related species , and certain extract ives are of value in taxonomy . There is considerable variation in the distribution of the extractives throughout the wood of a given tree . Sugars and other sap-soluble constituents , and deposited reserve foods such as starch and fats , are found in the sapwood . Phenolic materials , however , are usually deposited iii the heartwood . There are variations in the amount of deposited materials throughout the height of the tree and between the main stem and the branches . There is also variation within the fine structure of the wood . Fats are found in the parenchymatous cells , especially the ray parenchyma , whereas the resin acids are secreted by the epithelial cells and tend to fill the resin ducts . Some materials appear to be deposited in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sapwood of the living tree , and are deposited within the wood capillaries and on the wood surfaces when the wood is dried . The extractives often play an importants role in the utilization of wood , and influence the physical properties of the wood ( 141 ) . Colored and volatile constituents provide esthetic values . Certain phenolic compounds lend resistance to fungal and insect attack with resulting durability , and silica imparts resistance to the marine borer . Some extractives are utilized commercially . At present , guebracho extract from the heartwood of the South American tree is one of the chief sources of vegetable tannins ; sulfate turpentine and tall oil  | provide a large proportion of the turpentine , rosin , and fatty acids produced iu this country ; camphor is an extractive of the camphor tree and is produced synthetically from terpeues obtained from the pines . Some extractives have negative values iu the utilization of the wood . Alkaloids and some other physiologically active materials may present health hazards . The usual calcium base sulfite pulping is inhibited by certain phenols present in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wood pulps are due to extractives . Some materials contribute to corrosion ( 129 ) , and the presence of starch makes wood more susceptible to insect attack . Extractives occur in other parts of the tree and in other plant tissues , often in higher concentrations than in the wood . Bark and roots are rich sources of extractives , whereas the components of leaves , flowers , and seeds are of great biological importance . Exudates are often produced by sapwood or inner bark especially when the tree is injured . Exudates include polysaccharide gums , water-insoluble resins , and volatile oils . Those comprised of resins and volatile oils are known as oleoresins , and those from the pines are sometimes referred to as " gum " . However , the pine exudates are very different from the carbohydrate exudates of some other trees which are the trite gums . Latexes secreted by the inner bark are important sources of certain extraneous materials . Although the extractives of wood should be considered in their relationship to the broad field of plant products , this chapter is limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wood . The extractives have been classified into various groups on the basis of certain structural features , but there is often overlapping because of the polyfunctional nature of some compounds . They may be grouped according to physical properties such as solubility ( 118 ) , or according to botanical families and genera . Botanical classification is very instructive , but is limited by the fact that many species have not been studied thoroughly . Several classes of extractives have been reviewed ( 144 ) , and previous books on wood chemistry have included chapters on extractives ( 73,188 ) . Wehnrer ( 182 ) has compiled the older literature according to species , and Karrer ( 95 ) has recently listed references for the individual compounds including references to structural studies , as well as to sources of the substances . Reviews have been  | published on : heartwood extractives of the conifers ( 46 ) , wood extractives ( 99 ) , extractives of American pulpwood : , ( 93 ) , the literal ure for 1957 ? 59 ( 149 ) , and chromatography iii the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has described the sources of the commercial gums and resins and vegetable tannins . Several articles have discussed the value of infrared spectroscopy in the determination of structure and sterochemistry of the resin acids ( 26 ) , sterols ( 38,94 ) , triterpenes ( 39 ) , and some flavonoids ( 92 ) . II . Volatile Oils Wood often contains appreciable amounts of volatile or essential oils . These , especially the oxygenated constituents , are responsible for the characteristic odors associated with fresh wood . Depending on the species , the volatile constituents consist of terpenes and related substances , paraffin compounds , and even aromatic compounds . These substances , for the most part , have boiling points of over 100 ? C. , but they are characterized by an appreciable vapor pressure at room temperature and by the fact that they distill with steam . In addition to the usual essential oils , steam distillation of wood normally produces some acetic acid owing to the hydrolysis of acetyl groups in the holocellulose ; acetic acid , however , should not be considered an extraneous material . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wood is dried , and thus the usual moisture determination may include substances other than water . hurth ( 119 ) has compiled data published up to about 1950 on the volatile oils from both oleoresins and wood for species of several families . Most of ' the substances reported for both softwoods and hardwoods are terpenes or related materials . Mirov ( 134 ) has tabulated data on the composition of gum turpentines from the oleoresin from different species of pine . Most of the pines from the southeastern part of the United States and some of the European pines produce turpentines comprised chiefly of a-pinene and 0-pinene , the former predominating . The oleoresins from Jeffrey pine and digger pine are unusual in that n-heptane is the major volatile constituent . Small amounts of n-heptane and n-undecane have been found in the turpentines of some other pines ( 135 ) , and small amounts of octyl , nonyl , and decyl aldehydes are present in some turpentines.  | III . Terpenes and Related Materials Many natural substances have carbon structures which appear to he built-up of isoprene units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to follow the isoprene rule . The term isoprenoid is used to designate the broad class . Although isoprene is not considered a precursor , the isoprene rule has been useful in considering biogenetic relationships ( 162 ) and in determining structures . The monoterpenes contain two isoprene units ; the sesquiterpenes , three ; the diterpenes , four ; and the triterpenes have six such units . The C40 carotenoids are related materials , but they appear to be rare in wood . The terpenes include both acyclic and cyclic compounds . The apparent addition of each isoprene unit involves the loss of one double bond , and each ring closure results in the loss of an additional double bond . Thus , the acyclic monoterpene ocimene contains three double bonds , whereas the bicyclic pinenes contain only one double bond . The position of the double bonds varies because of isomerization . In addition , the related dihydro- and dehydrocompounds are often found in nature . Many isoprenoids are alcohols , ketones , or acids which seem to be formed by the addition of water to double bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include the terpene alcohols , the ketone camphor , and the resin acids . In addition , certain natural products including the tropolones and the sterols appear to be closely related to the terpenes , although they do not follow the isoprene rule . I n a strict sense , the term terpene should refer only to the hydrocarbons , and the oxygenated compounds should be classed as I erpenoids . However , terpene is sometimes used in a broad sense to include the oxygen-containing compounds . The isoprenoids often occur as mixtures of related materials which arc difficult to separate . Some of the compounds isomerize readily , and some undergo disproportionation reactions . Asymmetric carbons are present , and as a rule the natural products are optically active . Despite these factors , remarkable progress has been made in the chemistry of these compounds , although our knowledge is far from vompletc. ( h-ing to difficulties in purification , there are often differences in the physical constants that have been reported .  | A. MONOTERPENES The gum turpentines of most pines are comprised chiefly of monoterpenes ( C , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the turpentine of a few species . a-Pinene ( I ) is probably the most important monoterpene . It is the major component of commercial turpentine , and occurs in many other volatile oils . Both the d and l forms are common : the latter occurs in the gum turpentine of slash pine , whereas the former is present in the gum turpentine of longleaf pine . a-Pinene undergoes many chemical reactions ( 171 ) and is an important starting material in the synthesis of camphor and other chemicals . The reactions of a-pinene depend , in part , on the presence of a reactive double bond , and in part on a ring system which readily undergoes isomerization. a-Phalle adds nitrosyl chloride to form a solid derivative , which is useful for identification and purification . In the presence of air , a-pinene undergoes oxidation and polymerization . Apparently , a peroxide , which is responsible for further oxidation to various oxygenated compounds including sobrerol , verbenol , and verbenone , is formed initially . a-Pinene adds hydrogen chloride with isomerization t o form bornyl chloride and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms bornyl and fenchyl alcohol . Thermal isomerization produces dipentene , camphene , the acyclic tcrpene allo-ocimene , and other products , depending on the heating conditions and the catalyst . , O-Pinene ( II ) , or nopinene , occurs in many essential oils along with a-pinene and is usually present as the I form . 0-Pinene does not form a crystalline addition product with nitrosyl chloride , but may be oxidized to the crystalline nopinic acid . It is easily isomerized to a-pinene , and normally is not separated from the latter . Camphene ( Ill ) , the only crystalline bicyclic terpene , occurs in a number of essential oils , both in the d and the 1 forms . As camphene is crystalline it is rather easily obtained in pure form , but the ring structure is unstable and thus , it readily isomerizes . Camphene is an important intermediate in the synthesis of camphor and other chemicals from the pineues. a-Pinene can be converted directly into camphene or it may be treated with hydrogen chloride to form bornyl chloride which , on loss of hydrogen chloride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to camphor or hydrated to isoborneol  | which is easily oxidized to camphor . These reactions involve an interesting series of isomerizatioiis involving ring rupture and closure . ( hlorination of camphene yields the product known as toxaphene which is used widely as an insecticide . Toxaphene is a mixture of isomeric substances , with a composition approximating C10H10C18. figure , Y- ( 'arene ( IV ) is the chief constituent of the turpentine from the Indian pine , Pinus longifolia . It is also present in European turpentines , and some turpentines from the western part of the United States . It has a sweet penetrating odor , is readily oxidized , and resitiifics in the air . It isomerizes to the monocyclic terpene , sylvestrene , which has been obtained from turpentines containing A3-carene . On treatment with hydrogen chloride 03-carene is converted into a mixture of the hydrochlorides of sylvestrene and dipentene . Limonene ( V ) , 1,8(9)-p-menthadicne , is one of the most important monocyclic tcrpenes . It is the major constituent of pond pine turpentine , and occurs in other turpentines and essential oils . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pinenes , and is present in appreciable amounts in the volatile oils from old pine slumps . I ) ipentenc has a higher boiling point than the pinenes , and is often separated from wood turpentine as an intermediate cut hetweeii the pinenes and pine oil . Limonene is a relatively stable terpene , but it does undergo oxidation in the air . In the absence of figure  | moisture it forms an optically active hydrochloride , whereas in the presence of moisture dipentene hydrochloride is formed . Limonenc can be hydrated to the unsaturated alcohol a-terpineol and the dihydric alcohol , terpin hydrate . Limonene and some other terpenoids undergo disproportionation reactions in which part of the material is hydrogenated and another part dehydrogenated . Thus , limonene is converted to a mixture of p-cymene and p-menthane when heated in the presence of copper formate ( as a catalyst ) . ( 3-Phellandrene ( VI ) is a major constituent of the turpentine from lodgepole pine and from Coulter pine , and occurs in other essential oils including that from Canada balsam . , Q-Phellandrene is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distillation at atmospheric pressure . Other naturally occurring monoterpenes include bicyclic compounds : a-thujene , the chief component of the turpentine from Boswellia serrata ; A4-carene , which has been isolated from some European turpentines and from pine needle oil ; santene , which is found in East Indian sandalwood oil ; monocyclic ; terpenes : terpinolene and a-terpinene , which are present in wood turpentine as a result of isomerization of the pinenes ; acyclic terpenes : ocimene ; myrcene , which has been found in loblolly turpentine ; and linalool , occurring in the wood of Ocotea candata . B. OXY(ENATET) MONOTEBPENES Small amounts of oxygen-containing compounds are present in the turpentines from some pines , and considerably larger amounts are present in wood turpentine obtained from aged pine stumps because of changes that occur during the natural aging process . The oxygenated materials have higher boiling points than the corresponding terpenes , and are , therefore , concentrated in the higher boiling fractions . Thus , pine oil from aged stumps consists of 50 to 60% aterpineol ( VII ) with smaller amounts of dihydro-a-terpineol , fenchyl alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these compounds are white crystalline solids with characteristic odors , and for this reason some are known as " camphors . " Sonic are valuable in perfumery . Terpineol ( VII ) is formed by the dehydration of terpin hydrate and by the action of sulfuric acid on a-pinene . It is the major constituent  | of pine oil and is present in camphor oils and some other essential oils . a-Terpineol is easily dehydrated to dipentene and other terpenes depending on the reaction conditions , and it may be hydrated to terpin hydrate . It is a tetrahydro-p-cymene alcohol , and thus is related to other compounds discussed in Section III-D. figure Borneol ( VIII ) , which has a camphor-like odor , is produced by the hydration of a-pinene and is readily oxidized to camphor . Borneol is a constituent of camphor oil . Bornyl acetate occurs in some essential oils , and seems to be especially common in species of Abies ( 119 ) . Fenchyl alcohol ( IX ) may be prepared from the pinenes and is found in pine oil . Four optically active isomers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l-borneol , d- and l-isoborneol , d- and l-a-fenchyl alcohol , and d- and l-0-fenchyl alcohol . The a-fenchyl alcohols have melting points of 47 and 48 ? C. , and the f3-fenchyl alcohols melt at 5 and 6 ? C. Camphor oil obtained from the wood and other parts of the camphor tree , Cinnamomum camphora ( Lauraceae ) , contains a large number of terpenes and related materials ; however , some of these may lie formed during the distillation of the oil from the wood . Camphor ( X. ) is the important constituent and has been an article of commerce for a long time . The d form is obtained from the camphor tree , but 1 he l and dl forms occur in other oils . Since turpentine is a mixture of el- and l-a-pinene , synthetic camphor is optically inactive , although  | the active forms may be prepared from active a-pinene . The methylene group adjacent to the carbonyl group is reactive , but otherwise , camphor is a relatively stable compound . Several additional monoterpene alcohols and carbonyl compounds occur in nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series . IIowever , chamic and chaminic acids , which have been isolated from the heartwood of Chamaecyparis noolkatensis , are C ? ) acids ( 49 ) . C. TROPOLONES AND THUJIC ACID An interesting class of steam volatile compounds is found iii the heartwood of western red-cedar and several other species of the cypress family ( Cupressaceae ) . Initially , the compounds were believed to he phenols , but subsequently they were found to be substituted tropolones ( 47 ) . Tropolone ( XI ) is cycloheptatrieneolone , and this nucleus is also found in certain mold metabolites and in the alkaloid colchinine. figure The chemistry of the tropolones has been reviewed ( 142,145 ) . They have aromatic properties , and are somewhat more acidic than are the usual phenols . They form red-colored complexes with ferric salts which change to green with an excess of the ferric salt , and form green-colored complexes with copper acetate and even with metallic copper . This has provided an ingenious method for collecting rather large amounts of tropolones from western red-cedar ( 92 ) , in which copper bronze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | weeks the deposit of copper complexes which had formed on the screens was dissolved in chloroform , and the free tropolones were liberated with hydrogen sulfide . The tropolones are considered to consist of a highly mobile tautomeric system , having both intramolecular hydrogen bonding and resonance . Because of the rapid tautomeric equilibrium only three monosubstituted products are known , indicating an equivalency for positions 3 and 7 , and 4 and 6 . Pauson has suggested rules for naming the tropolones ( 145 ) , but the natural products have been given trivial names . Substituted tropolones found in wood are listed in Table I. a- , 13- , figure and y-thujaplicin were isolated from western red-cedar ( Thuja plicata ) in which they amount to as much as 1.2% of the heartwood . Concentration is greatest in the outer butt , heartwood and gradually decreases to essentially zero in the innermost portion of heartwood ( 130 ) . , Q-Thujaplicin was also isolated by Japanese investigators ( 142 ) , and was known as hinokitol before the identity of the two materials was demonstrated . The crystalline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolated as follows : nootkatin from Chamaecyparis nootkatensis ( 44 ) , chamaecin from Formosan hinoki ( Chamaecyparis taiwanensis ) ( 62 ) , 13-dolabrin from hiba wood ( Thujop.sis dolabrata ) ( 143 ) , 0-thujaplicinol from western redcedar , and pygmaein from Cupressus pygmaea ( 194 ) . Paper chromat ography has indicated additional tropolones which have not , as yet , been characterized ( 194 ) . 0-'I'hiijaplicin is widely distributed in species of the Cupressaceae and is often the major tropolone iii a given species . Nootkatin is  | common in the genus Cupressus , and is the major t ropolone in yellowcedar . The other tropolones appear to be less widely distributed , and in general , amount to less than 0.1% of the woods in which they do occur . Although most of the Cupressaceae species tested contain tropolones , some Juniperus species , including J. virginiana ( eastern red-cedar ) , apparently do not . The tropolones have attracted considerable attention because of their significance in taxonomic relationships , and because they contribute to the durability of the heartwood . They are corrosive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they form salts that are not corrosive ( 129 ) . In addition to the tropolones , steam distillation of western red-cedar heartwood yields a crystalline acid which was first believed to be dehydroperillic acid because it is easily isomerized to p-isopropyl benzoic acid . This acid subsequently was shown to he **33;818;TOOLONG acid and was renamed thujic acid ( XII ) ( 48 ) . It occurs both in the free form and as the methyl ester . A second acid named shonanic acid , along with thujic acid , was isolated from an alkaline extract of the wood of Libocedrus formosana ( 127 ) . This acid which was isolated in a yield of 0.2 to 0.4% appears to be a dihydrothujic acid . D. p-CYMF ; NE AND RELATED AROMATIC COMPOUNDS The aromatic compound p-cymene ( XIII ) is the chief constituent of sulfite turpentine obtained from relief gases in the acid sulfite pulping of spruce and hemlock woods . It occurs in small amounts in some woods , but its presence in sulfite turpentine is due largely to isomerization and dehydrogenation of the monoterpenes present in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sulfite turpentine is not an important commercial product , but , some p-cymene is synthesized from the pinenes. figure  | Carvacrol ( XIV ) and thymol are isomeric hydroxy-p-eymenes which occur in several essential oils . The former is found in the volatile oils from some species of the Cupressaceae . Carvacrol , p-methoxythymol ( XV ) , small amounts of p-methoxycarvacrol , hydrothymoquinone ( XVI ) , and thymoquinone are volatile constituents of the heartwood of incense-cedar ( 193 ) . A dehydrodi-pmethoxythymol , libocedrol ( XVII ) , and heyderiol , **39;853;TOOLONG , have been isolated from the acetone extract of incense-cedar heartwood ( 192 ) . Libocedrol forms an addition compound with p-methoxythymol , and occurs as such in the wood . A red quinone isolated from the petroleum ether extract is a similar dehydro-compound composed of three p-methoxythymol units , one of which is oxidized to the corresponding quinone ( 191 ) . Methyl chavicol or esdragol ( XVIII ) is present in small amounts in some turpentines and some other volatile oils . E. SESQUITEItPENES With 15 carbon atoms , a large number of sesquiterpenes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 170 ) . Included are cadiuene ( XIX ) and longifolene which are present in some I laploxylon or white pine turpentines , cedrene ( XX ) and the alcohols cedrenol and cedrol found in cedar wood oil from Juniperus rirginiana , a- and 0-santalene and a- and Q-santalol the chief constituents of sandalwood oil , a- and $-gurjunenes from the oleoresin of some Dipterocarpas species , lanceol a primary monocyclic alcohol from the wood of Santalum lanceolatum , cadinol which is present in West Indian sandalwood oil , guaiol from guaiacum wood oil of Bnlnesia sarrnienti , and the ketones a- and y-atlantone from the wood of some Ccdra species .  | Five isomeric cadinenes have been reported which differ iii the position of the double bond , and which give the same dihydrochloride ( 86 ) . The cadinenes and some other sesquiterpenes are bicyclic with a reduced naphthalene structure , while other bicyclic compounds have one ring with less than six carbon atoms . Cedrene , longifolene , and others are tricyclic . Guaiol and some other compounds are partially reduced azulenes , and on dehydrogenation yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or azulene oils found in some cases . The parent compound , azulene , is isomeric with naphthalene and consists of a 5-membered ring fused to a 7-membered ring . Sesquiterpene lactones with a reduced naphthalene structure have been known for some time iu the oils of certain roots and flowers . More recently , lactones have been found which contain a 10-membered ring ( 175 ) . Cuparene , an aromatic sesquiterpene , and the related cuparenic acid were isolated from Chainaecyparis thyoides , and the former occurs in other species of Cupressaceae ( 45 ) . F. RESIN ACI1 ) 5 ( DITE1tPEXES ) Several naturally occurring diterpenes and oxygenated derivatives are known ( 170,181 ) , and of these , the resin acids found in the pine family appear to be the most important in wood chemistry . Camphorene is a hydrocarbon present in camphor oil . The alcohols include phytol , an acyclic compound obtained on saponification of chloro-  | phyll , the phenols ferruginol , and totarol from species of Podocarpus nd hinokiol from Chauraecypari.s obbusa . JIanoyl oxide and ketomanoyl oxide have been isolated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acids found in pinewood and in pine oleoresin ontain a partially reduced phenanthrene ring system and on dehydrogenation yield substituted phenanthrenes . The abietic acid type ids yield retene ( **32;894;TOOLONG ) on dehydrogenation , whereas the pimaric acid-type acids give pimanthrene I , 7-dimethylphenanthrene ) . . I he abietic acid-type acids include levopimaric , abietic , neoabietic , uI palustric acids . They differ from each other in regard to the i ion of the double bonds . They are relatively unstable and readily Nude ' go isomerization or oxidation . Levopimaric acid is the chief d in pine oleoresin . It isomerizes to abietic acid when heated , r , , I because of this it is essentially absent in commercial rosins . I , it , t is acid ( XXI ) is usually the predominant acid in rosin. 1 , s readily formed from levopimaric acid , and is also formed by t1 raged heating of neoabietic and palustric acids . Since abietic acid formed by isomerization of the other acids , there has been doubt as twitter it was a primary acid occurring in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate that abietic acid does exist in oleoresin . The free acid undergoes oxidation , but the quarter sodium salt ( C2oH29O2Na ? 3C20H30O2 ) is stable . Neoabietic and palustric acids occur both iii oleoresin and in rosin. palustric acid , which has been known for only a few years , was isolated first from Pinus palustric , and has subsequently been isolated from P. caribaea , P. elliotti , P. sylz'estris , and Picea abies ( 28 ) . Thus it appears to be rather commonly distributed in the pines and spruces . Levopimaric acid reacts with maleic anhydride at room temperature , and abietic , neoabietic , and palustric acids react at elevated temperatures to give the same product . Apparently , the latter three acids when heated are in equilibrium with small amounts of levopimaric acid which forms the adduct . The maleic anhydride reaction is used to separate the reactive acids from the nonreactive acids , and is used commercially in the production of fortified size ( 177 ) . The abietic acid-type acids undergo disproportionation when heated and perhaps , to some extent , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in oleoresin and in rosin , and tetrahydroabietic acid is often present in rosin . Dehydroabietic acid contains a typical aromatic ring , whereas tetrahydroabietic acid is free of double bonds . The presence of a dihydroabietic acid is indicated in pine oleoresin by the formation of a lactone on treatment with sulfuric acid ( 54 ) . Since different dihydroabietic acids give the same lactone under these conditions , the exact nature of the dihydroabietic acid in oleoresin and rosin seems uncertain . Pimaric acid ( XXII ) and isopimaric acid are pimaric-type acids which differ in configuration and in the location of the nuclear double bond ( 8a ) . They do not react with malcic anhydride , do not isomerize readily , and are more stable to oxidation than are the abietic-type acids . These acids were formerly called dextropimaric and isodextropimaric acids , hut it has recently been suggested that the shorter names be used because they are not optical isomers of levopimaric acid . Isopimarie acid also occurs in species of the Podocarpaceae and has been called miropinic acid ( 25 ) . The structure given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this designation , a heavy line indicates the a-configuration , whereas a dotted line indicates the 0-configuration . Isopimaric acid has the same configuration at Cr , Cn , and C12 , but the two acids are epimeric at C13 and C7 ( 27 ) . The configuration of abietic , and probably neoabietic , acid is the same as that of pimaric acid at C , , C , , ,  | Cu , and Cu , whereas the configuration of levopimaric acid differs at C13 ( 114 ) . The resin acids normally occur as the free acids , and they do not esterify readily with alcohols . This fact permits a separation from fatty acids , since the latter are more readily esterified . The resin acids form insoluble salts with certain amines . Thus , cyclohexylamine forms acetone-insoluble salts with most of the resin acids , whereas other amines are more or less specific for the precipitation of the individual acids ( 77 ) . The resin acids develop a red coloration when treated with concentrated sulfuric acid ? acetic anhydride , which is the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other natural products including the sterols and some terpene alcohols give colorations with the same reagent . The resin acids may be partially separated by column chromatography ( 128 ) , but apparently they have not been separated by paper chromatography . Gas chromatography has been used for the separation of the methyl esters , but there is some isomerization at the higher temperatures and some esters were not separated ( 91 ) . Published data on the composition of oleoresin and rosins are somewhat variable , owing to an appreciable variation between samples and , to some extent , to different methods of analysis . The acids in the oleoresin from slash and longleaf pines are comprised of figure  | 20 to 35% levopinucric acid , roughly 10% each of abietic , neoabietic , and palustric acids , and somewhat smaller amounts of pimaric , isopimaric , dehydroahietic , and dihydroahietic acids . Two sets of data from gum rosin and tall oil rosin are given in Table II . These indicate that tall oil rosin contains somewhat more abietic and dehydroabiet is acids than does gum rosin . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxidation of levopimaric acid in the wood chips to hydroxy acids which on subsequent processing are dehydrated to form dehydroahietic acid . In addition , tall oil rosin contains less unsaponifiables than does gum rosin . In addition to the acids listed in Table Il , cariheic acid has been reported in the oleoresin of slash pine , but was not indicated in that of ' longleaf pine ( 74 ) . Podocarpic acid from Pterocarpus species has the phenanthrene ring system , but lacks the three carbon side chain of the usual resin acids ( 112 ) , and thus is not a diterpene acid . The diterpeuoids , cativic , eperuic , vinhaticoic , and voacapenic acids , are found in the oleoresins or in the wood of certain members of the Leguninosae ( 181 ) . Cathie and eperuic acids are bicyclic cornpounds , whereas vinhaticoic and voacapenic acids are tetracyclic acids containing a fnran ring . The two latter acids were found as methyl esters . The usual analytical determination of resin acids depends on selective esterification , and includes materials other than resin acids ( 139 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of birch and aspen may he in error . However , chromatography and color reactions suggest that the wood of white birch and quaking aspen does contain very small amounts of resin acids similar to those found in pine wood ( 301 . G. STEROLS A number of natural products from widely different sources are tetracyclic compounds with a reduced cyclopentenophenanthrene ring system , and are known as steroids . The broad class includes sterols , bile acids , sex hormones , adrenal hormones , cardiac glycosides , toad poisons , certain saponins , and some alkaloids ( 53 ) . Of these , the sterols are most important in wood chemistry . Sterols a secondary alcohols , which on dehydrogenation yield Diels hydro carbon ( XXIII ) . They usually contain 27 to 29 carbon atoms , an thus are not isoprenoids . However , part of the ring system is that r the common resin acids , and part of the side chain consists of u  | isopentane or substituted isopentane unit . The naturally occurring sterols have a hydroxyl group at C3 with the 0-configuration , methyl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 to 8 carbon side chain attached o C17 . Compounds with a double bond are known as stenols , and he fully hydrogenated compounds as stanols. figure Sterols are present as minor components in both animal and plant Iats , and are present in larger proportions in fats from sources which contain only small amounts of fat . The sterols occur both free and as ers and glycosides . In animal fats , they occur in part as esters of i Ile higher fatty acids , and estimation of both free and combined rterols is a common procedure . Some steroids such as the saponins and the cardiac active materials are glycosides , and recently sterol gl i ? osides have been isolated from the phospholipid fraction of eral seed fats . Sterols in wood also occur both free and combined , 1,11 t t he nature of the combined forms has received but little attention lu wood chemistry . 0-Sitosterol-D-glucoside was isolated from insectIntesled wood of Acer negundo ( 116 ) and from the wood of Aristotelia , Iola ( 31 ) , the mixed phthalic acid ester of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood ( 115 ) , and a sterol Ilucoside was found in the European aspen Poplins tremula ( 150 ) ,  | Sterols have been isolated from many species of wood , and they seem to be common wood components . 0-Sitosterol ( XXIV ) is the major sterol in the pines , spruces , and larches , and it has been reported in several hardwood species . Smaller amounts of related sterols probably accompany 0-sitosterol in these species , and appreciable amounts of dihydrositosterol are present in tall oil pitch . f3-Sitosterol has the carbon structure of cholesterol , the common sterol of animal tissues , except that an ethyl group is attached at C24 . Although 0-sitosterol is the major sterol constituent of many species of wood , the sterols from some species have not been wellcharacterized . A sterol from Betula verrucosa was originally believed to differ from 0-sitosterol ( 97 ) , but a recent report suggests that the sterol fraction from this species consists of a mixture of , Q-sitosterol and the corresponding dihydrositosterol ( 1 ( ; 8 ) . The major sterols in Eucalyptus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently are not 0-sitosterol . The sterol from quaking aspen was believed to have the composition C32H560 , and was thought to be identical to the sterol isolated previously as the glucoside from the European aspen ( 150 ) . This compound might be considered a substituted triterpene alcohol , but the Liebermann Burchard color reaction and the changes in molecular rotation on acetylation and benzoylation suggest that it should be classed as a sterol . Free sterols with a 3-0-configuration react with digitonin ( a saponin ) to form sparingly soluble complexes consisting of equal molecular proportions of sterol and digitonin . Sterol esters , however , do not form these insoluble complexes . Thus , precipitation with digitonin provides a means of determining free sterols . Total sterols may be determined after saponification . Some nonsterols form complexes with digitonin , but these are somewhat more soluble ( 53 ) . The Liebermann-Burchard reaction is a color test for sterols in - which the sterol is treated with cold acetic anhydride and sulfuric acid . The color depends on the reaction conditions , but in general 0-sitosterol gives a blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The resin acids and at least some triterpene alcohols give a reddish coloration with the same reagent . The presence of a double bond in the ring system seems necessary for this color reaction . Both free sterols and the esters give the reaction , and the procedure has been used for the estimation of total sterols iii animal tissues .  | C. TRITI lPENES Only a few triterpene hydrocarbons have been found in nature . Squalene , a dihydrotriterpeue , occurs in many oils of both vegetable figure and animal origin . It has been reported in tall oil ( 43a ) , and seems to be present in pine bark ( 144a ) . It has been isolated from paper birch wood ( 28a ) , and is probably present in many species of wood . A large number of oxygenated compounds containing : 30 carbons have been isolated from a variety of plant sources ( 172 ) . Most of t these follow the isoprene rule and are known as triterpenoids , or simply as triterpenes . Many are alcohols containing 50 hydrogen  | atoms , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are known . Usually the triterpenes have been obtained from resinous exudates , plant saps , leaves , and bark . To ( late , they have been isolated from only a few species of wood ( see ' fable Ill ) , but it seems likely that future work will indicate a more widespread distribution in wood . The alcohols occur free , as acetates , and as glycosides ( saponins ) . Reference has already been made to steroidal saponins. ' 1 he term saponin refers to a group of plant glycosides which stabilize aqueous foams . Certain of the saponins cause hemolysis of red blood corpuscles and are toxic to fish . They are subdivided according to the nature of the aglycones obtained on hydrolysis . One group produces steroids , and the other triterpene alcohols or hydroxy acids. 1 he saponins are dispersible with water because of the hydrophilic sugar units , but the free triterpene alcohols are water-repellent substances which tend to prevent loss of water at any exposed surfaces when the plant is injured . Several triterpenes , including hydroxydammarenone-II , contain a ring structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 53 ) . Cycloartenol and cycloeucalenol have the same carbon skeleton with the addition of a cyclopropane ring . These compounds have some properties similar to the sterols , and have been designated methylsterols. - However , their optical rotations and their color reactions suggest that they should be grouped with the triterpenes . Most of the triterpenes are pentacyclic , and many of these belong to the 0-amyrin or oleanane series . The a-amyrin or nrsane series has the same ring structure , b-ut , the distribution of the methyl groups is different . The lupine series , on the other hand , has a pentacyclic ring system with one 5-membered ring . Oleauolic , arjunolic , terminolic , and morolic acids belong to the 0-amyrin or oleanann series . Many triterpenes contain a double bond in the ring system win e is unreactive to the usual addition reagents . The unreactive doubt ? hood is usually detected by t he color reaction witch tetranitromet twine Nearly all of the triterpene alcohols which have been isolated trot , higher plants are dextrorotatory , and the molecular rotation is it creased when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molecular rotation are useful in indicating the type of triterpene , : u in distinguishing them from the sterols ( 13 ) . With the Lieberman ' IUrchard reagent , many triterpenes give a red color:ition rather 1111 the blue to green color given by the common sterols.  | IV . Fatty Acids Although fats are normally concentrated in seed tissues , appreciable mounts of higher fatty acids are obtained on saponification of the el her or benzene extracts of the wood of many species . In pine wood , and at least one species of spruce , oleic and linoleic acids are the iredominant acids , and small amounts of linolenic acid seem to be ' resent ( 30,96 ) . These are the common unsaturated C16 acids , with ne , two , and three double bonds , respectively . Next to oleic and inoleic acids , the Cis saturated acid , palmitic acid , is the most abunnnt fatty acid in the pines . Smaller amounts of the other evenlumbered saturated acids from stearic ( C18 ) to lignoceric acid ( C24 ) re also present . Aspen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t these species Iinoleic acid is the predominant acid and the proporion of oleic acid is nnich smaller than in the pines . In addition to the above , small amounts of other acids are present i nt least some species of wood . Laurie and myristic acids have been ' ported by some investigators , and small amounts of saturated ' ids ranging from CL to C8 ( as well as the even-numbered acids from 16 to C26 ) have been reported in European species of aspen and birch 5I , 168 ) . Palmitoleic ( the CH monounsaturated acid ) , a C20 unturated acid , ( - f-  ) -4-methylhexadecanoic acid , and n-heptadecanoic id ( 11 ) have been isolated from tall oil . Presumably , these acids re present in the original wood , but some may have been formed ring the processing . Gas chromatography has recently indicated e presence of all of the straight chain saturated acids from Cie to in quaking aspen wood , including the odd-numbered acids ( 78 ) . one time , the odd-numbered acids were considered to be absent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from some goal sources , and have been indicated by gas chromatography in n ? is . Procedures for the identification and estimation of the fatty acids not always specific . Thus , paper chromatography and the usual ' hods of analysis do not distinguish between straight and Welch-chain acids , or between the isomers of the unsaturated I. Oxidation studies have suggested that part of the " linoleic d " in pine wood is actually an isomer ( 98 ) . In the salmood of the living tree and in green wood , most of the  | fatty acids appear to be present as triglycerides , although small amounts of free acids are normally present in unseasoned wood , and some of the fatty acids may be esterified with higher alcohols such as the sterols . The nature of the glycerides in wood has not been investigated as yet , but based on studies of other fats , it seems likely that the glycerides are chiefly mixed glycerides . In most fats , the saturated acids are often esterified with the primary hydroxyl groups of the glycerol , but otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the variety of acids found in wood , a very large number of individual glycerides are possible . At least in some species of hardwoods the fatty materials are concentrated in the ray cells , and the fine fractions of some wood pulps contain up to 25% ether-soluble materials . In European species of alder , aspen , and birch the free acids were in the wood rays for the most part ( 152 ) , although some were found in the middle lamella of the tracheids and on the walls of the vessels . In Scots pine , the free acids were mainly in the cells of the resin canals , with some in the wood ray cells and in the middle lamella of the tracheids . The location in Norway spruce was similar to that in the pine , except that the concentration was not as high in the resin canals . In Juniperus cominunis , the fatty acids were concentrated in the wood rays and in the middle lamella of the tracheids . Seasoning apparently results in appreciable hydrolysis of the glycerides to free acids ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasoning , the unsaturated acids are partially oxidized and polymerized . This results in a decrease in petroleum ether solubility on seasoning . Ilot alkaline treatment isomerizes the unsaturated acids and , thus , in tall oil part of the linoleic acid has been isomerized to the conjugated isomer . The saturated acids , however , are stable and remain unchanged except for possible hydrolysis of the glycerides . V. Unsaponifiables hats normally contain materials which , after saponification , exist as nonacidic water-insoluble substances , and the proportion of these substances is somewhat higher in fats from sources such as wood which are relatively low in fat content . These unsaponifiables consist of sterols , any triterpene or other higher alcohols that may be present , and hydrocarbons . The sterols , at least , and possibly the other higher  | alcohols , occur both free and combined in the original fat , and are converted into the free form on complete saponification . Long chain fatty alcohols and hydrocarbons have been isolated in a few instances , and are probably present in other species which , as yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very weakly acidic phenolic materials may also be present . The complete nature of the unsaponifiables is still uncertain , and the term " reserve " is often used to designate some of the materials of unknown composition . Sterol esters of the fatty acids are difficult to saponify , and some of these may be present in the usual unsaponifiable fraction . VI . Carbohydrates Although the major carbohydrate components are nonextractable cell wall constituents , certain soluble substances and some materials which seem to be extraneous components are present in many species of wood . Sugars and glycosides transported by the sap are present in the sapwood and inner bark . Sucrose , glucose , and fructose are common in the sapwood of both softwoods and hardwoods , whereas small amounts of arabinose and glucose are found in the heartwood of several species ( 173 ) . L-Arabinose is found in both heartwood and sapwood of many conifers including the pines and western red cedar . Its presence may be due to the fact that the arabinans are readily hydrolyzed . L-Arabinonic acid has been isolated as the 1,4-lactone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Small amounts of raffinose , stachyose , and verbascose were found in European birch wood ( 125 ) . Phenols and other hydroxy compounds are sometimes present as the more soluble glycosides , but in general the glycosides are more common in the inner bark than in wood . Starch occurs in the sapwood of many hardwoods , and appears to serve as a reserve food supply . It is not soluble in the usual neutral solvents , but in some cases the granules have been washed out of finely divided wood ( 32 ) . It is stored in the pith , the wood parenchyma , and in the wood rays . Many of the older methods give quest ionable results , but the sapwood of some species seems to contain up f o about 5% starch . Polysaccharides , which on hydrolysis yield arabinose and galactose , have been extracted with cold water from the wood of western larch ,  | tamarack , Douglas-fir , black spruce , white spruce , jack pine , Jeffrey pine , and Monterey pine ( 1,21 ) . A second polysaccharide was isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hydrolysis gave mannose , galactose , and glucose . Monterey pine also contained small amounts of a glucomannan which formed an insoluble copper complex . The arahinogalactan from western larch ranges from 8 to 18% of the wood , but the soluble polysaccharides occur in the other species in much smaller amounts . Up to about 0.5% pectic materials have been isolated from the wood of Douglas-fir , loblolly pine , white pine , white spruce , western hemlock , western red-cedar , black locust , lemonwood , and mesquite ( 6a ) . These are not extractable with the usual neutral solvents , and they occur within the cell wall in part . However , they are often not considered with the usual cell wall components , and it seems well to mention them here . Pectic substances are galacturonans with associated arabinans and galactans ( 186 ) . The galaeturonic acid residues are largely present as methyl esters . VII . Polyhydric Alcohols Some extractives may be considered as derivatives of the sugars i which the carbonyl group is replaced by an alcohol group . Then , compounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some have the sweet taste and water solubility associated with th. simple sugars , but the carbonyl group is absent . Glycerol occurs : fatty acid glycerides in the wood of many species as discussed pro viously . The alcohols corresponding to the hexoses have not bee commonly found in wood , but mannitol is the major constituent o exudates from species of the ash family . Recently , substitute . anhydro-sugar alcohol structures have been discovered in bergenin an extractive of the heartwood of Shorea leprosula ( 82 ) , in vilexi which is obtained on acid hydrolysis of the extract of New Ze:tl:w ' puriri wood Vitex lucens ( 22 ) , and in keyakinin and keyakinol fro the heartwood of Zelkova serrata ( 60 ) . Although vitexin has be considered to be an artifact , it seems to occur in the wood both in t free form and as glycosides ( 167 ) . These compounds , like sot glycosides , consist of a phenolic compound combined with a pol hydric chain . However , the linkage is carbon to carbon , and it is u  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid , whereas vitexin and keyakinin are substituted flavones , and keyakinol Is a flavanone . Polyhydric cyclohexanes known as cyclitols are rather common plant constituents . Those with six hydroxyl groups are known as inositols , whereas those with five hydroxyls are quercitols ( 7 ) . Pinitol AV ) , a monomethyl ether of d-inositol , occurs in the wood of several of the white pines ( Haploxylon or five-needled pines ) , and is especially abundant in the wood of sugar pine . The heartwood of this npecies also contains d-inositol , myo-inositol , and sequoyitol ( XXVI ) , u methyl ether of myo-inositol ( 10 ) . Sequoyitol and pinitol have been isolated from the heartwood of the California redwood , and myoinositol has been reported in the wood of European birch ( 125 ) . In leaves and leafy twigs of the gymnosperms , pinitol was found iii peveral species of the Pinaceae , whereas sequoyitol was found in some Ppecies of most families ( 155 ) . The cyclitols are extracted by the usual alcohol or acetone extractions because of the presence of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acetone . They are rather stable compounds . figure All samples of wood contain small amounts of nitrogen due to the proteins from the original protoplasm , and several amino acids are present iii the xylem sap ( 18 ) . The woods of a few species contain somewhat larger amounts of nitrogen because of the presence of alkaloids . The term alkaloid is used to designate t he natural organic substances which are basic because of the presence of nitrogen . Usually this nitrogen is part of a ring system . Most alkaloids are colorless substances which are concentrated in the living tissues , and which are deposited iii the bark or in the seed hulls . Berberine found in barberry wood and liriodenine isolated from yellow poplar heartwood ( 29,178a ) are yellow compounds . Several tropical woods are believed to contain alkaloids . Anibine , 4-methoxy-6- ( 3 ' - pyridyl ) - pyrone , has recently been isolated from the wood of Aniba duckei and A. rosaeodora ( 138 ) , and dictamnine , maculine , and other alkaloids were found in the wood of Flindersia maculosa ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their presence is suspected in any woods having poisonous properties . However , some steroids , phenols , and quinones also have toxic properties . Although alkaloids are normally not expected in wood from the temperate zones , tests for basic substances seem worthwhile in any studies of new extracts . Although the nitro grouping is rare in natural products , 1-nitro-2-phenylethane has been isolated from the wood of Aniba canelilla and from Ocotea pretiosa ( 69 ) . IX . Aromatic Compounds Certain aromatic compounds have already been mentioned . Many additional aromatic compounds have been isolated from wood , nearly all of which are phenolic compounds . Side chains are often present , and in many instances , a three-carbon side chain is involved in a ring structure . Many phenols are deposited iii the heartwood and are responsible for the dark color and durability of the heartwood of several species . Certain phenolic substances are transported in the sap , and small amounts of these are present in the sapwood . Some phenols are extracted with ether or benzene , and thus accompany the fats and resin acids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ether-soluble materials are not removed by direct ether extraction . Alcohols and acetone give a more complete extraction of the phenolic materials , and the azeotrope of n-propanol and water is especially useful in a Soxhlet-type extraction . A. ACIDS , SOME ALDEHYDES , ANT ) ALCOHOLS Esters of phthalic acid have recently been found lit the wood of Sitka spruce ( 115 ) , and tamarack ( 140 ) and piperonylic acid has been isolated from the wood of Ocotea pretiosa ( 68 ) . The mcthylenedioxy group found in piperonylic acid does not seem to be very common in wood extractives , although it occurs in several natural products . Some hardwoods , especially the eucalyptus woods ( 87 ) , contain gallic and ellagic acids both free and combined as hydrolyzable tannins . Ellagic acid is a lactone of a didehydrogallic acid and is sparingly soluble in most solvents . p-Ilydroxybenzoic acid has been isolated from the alcohol benzene extract of quaking aspen wood ( 146 ) , and was obtained by alkaline hydrolysis of the extracts of several species of Populus and Salix ( 148 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of quaking aspen and northern black cottonwood . Smaller amounts of vanillic acid , syringic acid ( **30;928;TOOLONG acid ) , vanillin , and syringaldehyde were found in the hydrolysates , and these four substances were found in all of the hydrolysates from the 16 hardwood species which were tested . Ferulic acid ( **27;960;TOOLONG acid ) was indicated in most instances . These substances may have been derived from lignin-like materials in the extracts , but the acids were believed to be present , in part , as glucosides ( 147 ) . Small amounts of coniferin , syringin , vanillin , and syringaldehyde have been reported in a few species , but these materials appear to be minor extractives in most woods . Coniferin and syringin are the glucosides of coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols , respectively , and are believed to be important lignin precursors ( 117 ) . B. I , I ( ; NANS Several dimeric pllenylpropane ( Cs('a) compounds , which are linked between the 0-carbon atoms , are known as lignans . These occur in roots , heart %voo I , foliage , fruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the side chains are oxygenated , and occur irr the form of lactones , alcohols , or ethers . A comprehensive review of the naturally occurring lignans has been published ( 83 ) , and additional lignans have been discovered since that time ( 23,56 ) . Several species contain more than one lignan . Thus in addition to those indicated in Table IV , Podocarpir.s . spicatus contains coniden- figure drilc , and Picea c.rcel.sa contains oxomatairesinol , hydroxymata resinol , allo-hydroxymatairesinol , and 40 to 50 additional phenols r a similar nature were indicated by paper chromatography ( 5(i) ( ' onidendrin ( XXVII ) occurs in several spruces and hemlocks , Init has not been found irr all species of these genera . It dissolves during the sulfite pulping process and at one time was known as sulfite lirlunr Icetone . Most of the lignans found in wood and wood exudates contain guaicyl units , although **25;989;TOOLONG which occurs in alder wood ( Alnus ylutinosa ) as a xyloside ( 59 ) contains syringyl units , and the lignans eudesmin and gmelinol contain veratryl unit figure  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this reaction provides a convenient color test for pine heartwood . The two substances also condense with lignin in the usual bisulfite pulping process and inhibit the sulfite pulping of pine heartwood . Although the pinosylvins are ether-soluble , they are not extracted from the wood by direct ether extraction . This anomaly has been explained by the hypothesis that the substances occur within impermeable membranes . The " membranes " are soluble in acetone or alcohol , and these solvents extract the stilbenes . The hydroxystilbenes inhibit fungal growth , and thus are responsible for the durability of pine heartwood . They have a strong fluorescence and are readily seen on paper chromatograms under ultraviolet light . Appreciable amounts of hydroxystilbenes are not found in pine sapwood , and stilbenes other than pinosylvin and its derivatives have not commonly been found in pine heartwood . However , 4-hydroxystilbene and 4-niethoxystilbene have been reported in the heartwood of I'iucus tpri fithii ( 132 ) . Other stilbenes appear to be common in the inner hark of the spruces ( 131 ) . 3,5-Substituted stilbenes with addi-  | tional substitution in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moraceae , and Myrtaceae ( 80 ) . 2,4,3 ' , 5 ' -Tetrahydroxystilbene was isolated from the wood of white mulberry and Osage-orange ( 123 ) and from Artocarprrs lakoocha ( 137 ) . For the most part , the stilbenes occur free in wood and are not substituted except by hydroxyl and methoxyl groups . However , the 3-n-glucoside of 3,5,4 ' -trihydroxystilbene has been isolated from Eucalyptus wandoo ( 80 ) , and a terpenoid side chain is present in chlorophorin from eh/amphora excelsa ( 103 ) . D. FLAVONOIDS Several classes of compounds have a common structural feature in that a Cr6C3C6 carbon skeleton is present . The general term flavonoid has been used to designate this broad group of substances which includes chalcones , flavoucs , anthocyanidins , flavans , and related materials ( 63 ) . However , some authors have used the term flavonoid in a more restricted sense ( 75,95 ) . Chalcones are unsaturated ketones which undergo ring closure with an o-hydroxyl group to form flavanones or anthocyanidins depending on which ring contains the hydroxyl . Chalcones are colored substances , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood . Okanin ( XXIX ) and isookanin are trans and cis isomers from the wood of African greenheart , Cyclicodi.scns gabunen.sis ( 107 ) , and it chalcone named neoplathymenin  | is the principal crystalline pigment of the wood of Plathymncnia reticulata ( 110 ) . Chalcones have been isolated from sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate soluble fractions of extracts of the wood of Pinus griffithii ( 132 ) and some Pterocarpus species ( 163 ) . Since chalcones are readily formed from flavanones by ring opening ( 64 ) , some of the above substances may have been produced during the isolation . The numbering indicated in the structure for okanin is preferred by Chemical Abstracts , but many authors use a reversed system which designates okanin as 2,3,4,3 ' , 4 ' -pentahydroxychalcone . Angolensin from some Pterocarpus species ( 3 ) is isomeric with a dihydrochalcone. 1 . Flavones and FlaLranones Flavones and flavanones ( 2,3-dihydroflavones ) are common wood constituents ( see Table V ) . Flavones are 2-phenylbenzo-y-pyrones , figure and those with a hydroxyl in the 3-position are known as flavonols. i lavanones with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the phenyl group is attached to the 3-position instead of the 2-position are known as isoflavones and dihydroisoflavones , respectively , but these have not been found in ninny species of wood . lIost of the flavones have been known for a  | long time , and were constituents of some of the natural dyestuffs . Flavanones have been isolated from many species of wood during the last 12 years , and they seem to be more abundant in wood than the flavones . Flavones and flavanones found in wood often occur as a mixture of related compounds although the proportion of some constituents may be small . Since the flavanones are rather easily converted to flavones or chalcones , small amounts of these may be produced during the isolation . However , in several cases appreciable amounts of flavone and the corresponding flavanone occur together . Chrysin ( XXX ) and its 7-methyl ether known as tectochrysin and the corresponding flavanones , pinocembrin and pinostrobin , occur in the heartwood of most of the I-Taploxylon pines , but the flavones seem to be absent in the Diploxylon group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pinobanksin , are found in nearly all species of both groups . Methyl substituted dihydrochrysins ( strobopinin , cryptostrobin , and strobobanksin ) are found in the heartwood of sugar pine , eastern white pine , and a few other Haploxylon species . The pine heartwood flavonoids have not commonly been found in the wood of other species , but chrysin , tectochrysin , dihydrochrysin ( pinocembrin ) , dihydrotectochrysin , and other flavonoids have been reported in the wood of Prunus avium ( 35,133 ) , pinocembrin has been isolated from South American rosewood , Aniba rosaeodora ( 70 ) , and chrysin and tectochrysin occur in the winter buds of balsam poplar .  | Taxifolin ( XXXII ) was isolated originally from Douglas-fir heartwood in a yield of 0.7% ( 153 ) , and is present in the cork fraction of the inner bark in amounts of up to about 20% . It is a common constituent of species of Larix , and has been found in some species of Prunus , in Austrocedrus chilensis ( 50 ) , and in Biota orientalis ( 51 ) . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but has been reported in the heartwood of Maritime pine from the Landes region ( 34 ) and in the bark of some pines ( 84 ) . The 3 ' - 0- glucoside of taxifolin was found in the sapwood and cambium of Douglas-fir , and also in true cedars , larch , and spruce ( 85 ) . A trace of the 3 ' - 0- glucoside of quercetin was also indicated in the sapwood of Douglas-fir . Several flavonoids have been found in the woods of various Prunus species . Naringenin and aromadendrin and their glycosides are especially common in this genus ( 79 ) . Naringenin has also been found in the wood of Ferreirea spectabilis ( 104 ) and of Nothofagus dombeyi ( 153 ) . Aromadendrin occurs in species of Larix ( 59 ) , and together with dihydromorin , it is found in several species of the Moraceae family ( 123 ) . Dihydrorobinetin and robinetin were found in the heartwood of black locust to the extent of 5.3 and 2% , respectively ( 55 ) . Dihydrofisetin ( fustin ) and fisetin were found in Gleditsia japonica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur in the heartwood of Afzelia species ( 102 ) . In some species flavanones apparently are accompanied by chalcones ? liquiritigenin and isoliquiritigenin in Pterocarpus species ( 163 ) , and plathymenin ( 6,7,3 ' , 4 ' - tetrahydroxyfl avanone ) and neoplathymenin in Plathymenia reticulata ( 110 ) . Other flavones found in wood include afzelin , a 3-rhamnoside of kaempferol in the wood of Afzelia species ( 102 ) , and ayanin ( 3,7,4 ' - trimethylquercetin ) and the related compounds with an additional hydroxyl group , oxyayanin A and oxyayanin B , from the heartwood of Distemonanthus benthamianus ( 111 ) . Flavones differ from the corresponding flavanones in physical and chemical properties , because of the presence of the conjugated grouping C=C ? C=O in the former . In addition , the number and location of the hydroxyl groups influence the properties . The presence of a free hydroxyl in the 3-position is especially important . Flavones are water-insoluble but their glycosides are partially soluble . The Iavones fluoresce in ultraviolet light ( 75 ) , and those with 3- , 3 ' - , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3- , 4 ' - , and 7-hydroxyl groups are acidic , whereas the 3- , 5- , and 8-hydroxyl groups form  | colors with ferric chloride ( 24 ) . Hydrogen bonding occurs between the 5-hydroxyl and the carbonyl groups . The flavones are rather stable substances , and rather drastic conditions are required to open the pyrone ring . The flavanones are colorless compounds with little or no fluorescence , and those with several hydroxyl groups are somewhat soluble in water . 3-Hydroxyflavanones form sparingly soluble salts when treated with ammonium hydroxide at pH 6.9 or with sodium acetate , and this permits a separation from catechin , tannins , and other flavonoids which do not form the sparingly soluble salts ( 121 ) . Flavanones are converted to the corresponding flavones by air oxidation ( 71,153 ) or by heating with sodium or ammonium bisulfite solutions ( 120 ) . The oxygen-containing ring of the flavanones is not as stable as that in the flavones . Flavanones lacking a 3-hydroxyl group may undergo ring opening to form chalcones ( 64 ) , whereas alkali converts 3-hydroxyflavanones to conunaranones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the naturally occurring products are optically active . Inactive flavanones are produced by reducing flavones with sodium hydrosulfite in sodium carbonate solution . Structure XXXII indicates the configuration of taxifolin ( 36 ) . Color reactions are of value in distinguishing the various flavanoids . The flavanones and also the 3-hydroxyflavones form orange to magenta colors when treated with magnesium and hydrochloric acid , but only the 3-hydroxyflavanones form similar colors with zinc and hydrochloric acid ( 153 ) . Treatment with sodium borohydride , followed by exposure to hydrogen chloride , gives reddish colors with flavanones which lack the 3-hydroxyl group ( 88,161 ) . Isonicotinic acid hydrazide reacts with flavones and flavanones containing free 3-hydroxyl groups to give a strong fluorescence , and a scheme for the quantitative estimation of different classes of flavonoids is based on the use of this reagent ( 81 ) . Although not as common as the flavones and flavanones , some members of the isoflavone series have been found in wood . Santal ( 5,3 ' , 4 ' -trihydroxy-7-met hoxyisoHavone ) ( 93a ) , occurs in Pterocarpus . santalinus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) has been reported in some Primus species and occurs together with muningin ( 6,4 ' - **33;1016;TOOLONG ) in Pterocarpus anyolensis ( 106 ) . An isoflavone containing methyxol groups , podospicatin , has been isolated from Podocarpus spicatus ( 23 ) . Ferreiriu and honnoferreirin  | are methoxyisoflavanones found in Ferreirea spectabilis ( 113 ) , whereas a 7,2 ' -dihydroxyisoflavanone from the heartwood of Sophora japonica contains a methylenedioxy group ( 178 ) , and pterocarpin and homopterocarpin found in some Pterocarpus species are inner ethers of partially reduced dihydroisoflavones ( 3 ) . Many species of wood and bark contain colorless materials which on treatment with mineral acids produce red or anthocyanidin-like colors . These substances are known as leucoanthocyanins , or in some cases leucoanthocyanidins . They are difficult to isolate in a pure form , and most of them have not been completely characterized . Some have been shown to be flavan-3,4-diols ( 100 ) , and some are polymerized tannin-like materials ( 159 ) . Before discussing these substances , a brief description of the anthocyanidins seems desirable . The latter term designates a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form stable salts with mineral acids , and which are usually isolated as the salts . They form red-colored solutions in acid , and some give blue colorations in alkaline solution . In the free base form the anthocyanidins are isomeric with the flavanones , and may be considered as derived from flavones by partial reduction of the carbonyl group to a secondary alcohol . Authocynnidins often occur as glycosides which are known as anthocyanins.  |  Both the glycosides and free aglycones are found in some flowers and haves , but neither seem to be primary constituents of wood . Anthocyanidins may , however , be produced from leucoanthocyanins occurring in wood . The flavan-3,4-diols which have been characterized include melacacidin ( XXXIV ) from Australian rosewood Acacia melanoxylon ( 100 ) , leucofisetinidin and a 7,4 ' **25;1051;TOOLONG from the heartwood of Guibourta ( Copaifera ) species ( 158 ) , and a dextrorotatory leucodelphinidin from the kino of Eucalyptus pilularis ( 61 ) . ( + ) - Mollisacacidin ( gleditsin ) , obtained from the heartwood of Acacia mollissima and from Gleditsia japonica , and ( ? ) -leucofisetinidin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7,3 ' , 4 ' **26;1078;TOOLONG ( 37 ) ; the spruce leucoanthocyanidin from the inner bark of black spruce is 5,7,3 ' , 4 ' **27;1106;TOOLONG ( 131 ) . Peltogynol and its steroisomer peltogynol B from the heartwood of Pelloyyne species are inner ethers of a substituted flavan3,4-diol ( 33 ) . Several suggestions have been made for nomenclature in this area ( 57,76,166 ) . Originally the term leucoanthocyanin included both glycosides and the free aglycones ( 157 ) , but recently most authors have used leucoanthocyanidin to designate the aglycones . Some flavan-3,4-diols have been given trivial names , and others have been called leucocyanidin , leucofisetinidin , etc. , from the corresponding anthocyanidins . Freudenberg , however , suggests that these should  | be called leucocyanidin hydrate , etc. , since water is lost in the conversion to anthocyanidin . The term complex leucoanthocyanin has been used for the polymerized and condensed forms . Flavan-3,4-diols have been synthesized by reduction of 3-hydroxyflavanones ( 101 ) . They are somewhat unstable substances which are difficult to purify . The nature of the conversion of leucoanthocyanins to anthocyanidins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of oxygen or external oxidizing agents seems unnecessary . The yield of anthocyanidin is usually low , but is greatest under anhydrous conditions ( 160 ) . The low yield , coupled with the formation of catechins and phlobaphene materials , has suggested that disproportionation may occur . Recently , a **26;1135;TOOLONG was converted quantitatively into the corresponding anthocyanidin indicating that disproportionation is not necessary in all cases ( 156 ) . The net changes taking place in the conversion to anthocyanidin salts are the loss of two hydrogen atoms and the elimination of one molecule of water . 3 . Flavan-3-ols The term catechin has been used to name the isomeric 3,5,7,3 ' , 4 ' - pentahydroxyflavans , and also to designate the general class of flavan-3-ols . Chemical Abstracts prefers the term catechol because I these compounds , upon pyrolysis , yield pyrocatechol . However , the term catechin is still used by many authors . ( + ) - Catechin ( XXXVI ) and ( ? ) - epicatechin are the principal naturally occurring catechins , and they are found in many woods and barks ( 58 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C3 ( 17 ) . Flavan-3-ols with other hydroxylation patterns are known . Thus , ( ? ) - epiafzelechin ( 3,5,7,4 ' - I , etrahydroxyflavan ) has been isolated from the wood of species of Li fzelia ( 102 ) . The catechins are colorless crystalline substances that are somewhat soluble in water . Similar to the flavan-3,4-diols , they are difficult to purify , and undergo condensation and/or polymerization especially in the presence of acids . They have been synthesized from flavan-3,4-diols by hydrogenation ( 184 ) . E. TANNINS Since ancient times , aqueous extracts of certain plants have been used for the conversion of animal skins into leather . The substances  | responsible for the formation of leather are known as the vegetable tannins . This is a very general term and includes materials of varied chemical composition . Since a blend or mixture of materials is normally required to give the desired leather characteristics , it is often difficult to decide whether or not a given pure substance should he classed as a tannin . The vegetable tannins are comprised of substances with a high proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condensation or polymerization . Usually , only materials of relatively high molecular weight are considered true tannins , but some monomeric materials are fixed by hide powder . Several classification systems have been proposed for the tannins , some of them quite elaborate . As the exact nature of most tannins is unknown , only the simpler systems seem justified . Freudenberg has divided the tannins into the hydrolyzable class and the condensed tannins or phlopaphene class . The former contain ester and/or glycoside linkages , and on hydrolysis yield acids , sugars , and/or alcohols . Gallic acid , ellagic acid , and glucose are common hydrolysis products ( 164 ) . Tannins of this class occur in galls and leaves , but are not very common in woods . The condensed tannins on treatment with acid are polymerized further , rather than being hydrolyzed into simpler substances . Many investigators have attempted to elucidate the structure of the condensed tannins , and many hypotheses have been advanced . Freudenberg suggested , nearly : 30 years ago , that the condensed tannins are built up of catechin units , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hydroxylation pattern . Within flue last few , years , several investigators have recognized the common occurrence of leucoanthocyanin-like materials along with the condensed tannins , and have postulated that the tannins are built up , at least in part , of flavan-3,4-diol - units . This is supported by the common occurrence of leucoanthocyanins with tannins ( 14 ) , and by the discovery of complex leucoanthocyanins in common tannin preparat ions ( 159 ) . The complex leucoanthocyanins are polymeric materials that can be converted , in part , into simple anthocyanidins . It seems likely that the condensed tannins are formed in the plant by the condensation and/or polymerization of hydroxyflavans , both leucoanthocyanins and catechins , and perhaps other materials . Since the monomers may differ in the degree of hydroxylation in the aromatic  | rings , as well as in the pyrone ring , the formation of rather complex molecules is possible . Tannins are found in many barks , but the wood of most species is relatively free of tannin . However , quebracho wood from South America contains up to 20% tannin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of redwood , and several other wood species ( 188 ) . The vegetable tannins form blue or green colorations with ferric salts , and these colorations have sometimes been used to classify the materials as pyrogallol tannins and catechol tannins , respectively . Color reactions have been used to detect the presence of tannins in plant tissues , but in some cases the materials present are not considered to be tannins by the tanner . At present , the term polyphenols is often used to designate this general class of materials ; this seems to be a desirable usage . The tannins are often accompanied by similar materials , known as phlobaphenes , which are more highly condensed and are not water-soluble . E. OTHER , KETONl S AND QUINONES Several wood constituents , in addition to those mentioned previously , contain carbonyl groups . Maclurin from fustic wood is 2,4 , ( i , 3 ' , 4 ' **25;1163;TOOLONG , and cotoin from Aniba duct-el is a **28;1190;TOOLONG ( 70 ) . It is interesting to note that cotoin is similar in physical properties to pinocembrin , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two species of Aniba also contained two substituted a-pyrones , the alkaloid anibine and **30;1220;TOOLONG ( 138 ) . Several substituted henzo-a-pyrones ( coumarins ) are found in the wood of different species of the IR , utaceae ( 105 ) . Dalbergin , 4-phenyl-6 ( or 7 ) - hydroxy7 ( or ( i ) - methoxy coumarin , is found in the wood of Dalbergia sissoo ( 2 ) . Xanthones are colored substances with a benzene ring fused to the pyrone ring of benzo-y-pyrone . Euxanthone occurs in the wood of /'laionia insignis ( 188 ) , and jacareubin is found in Calophylbam hraziliense ( 109 ) . Compounds with a hydroquinone or pyrocatechol nucleus often are readily oxidized to the corresponding quinone , which in turn may be reduced to the hydroquinone and thus some of the previously de-  | scribed compounds may be oxidized to the quinone form . Several quinones have been found in nature ( 180 ) , especially in barks and roots and as metabolites of fungi . Quinones have been isolated from the wood of relatively few species , but many dark colored wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be somewhat more common in wood than present data indicate . The dyewoods brazilwood and logwood contain brazilin ( XXXVII ) and a hydroxybrazilin ( known as haematoxylin ) , which on exposure to air are oxidized to the quinoid dyestuffs brazilein and hacmatin ( XXXVIII ) , respectively . Desoxysantalin , occurring in species of Pterocarpus , and lapachol ( XXXIX ) , found in several species of the Bignoniaceae , are naphthoquinones . In some species , the yellow-colored lapachol is deposited in the pores , and may easily be seen with a hand lens . The chemistry of lapachol has been studied extensively , and one of the derivatives led to a number of compounds with antimalarial activity ( 52 ) . Anthraquinones and related materials occur in some species . Chrysarobin , reported in the greenheart woods of South America , is a mixture of anthraquinones and anthrones . Tectoquinone ( 2-  | methylanthraquinone ) occurs in teak wood , and **33;1252;TOOLONG has been found in the heartwood of Ferreira spectablis and in Tecoma species ( 104 ) . X. Inorganic Constituents A number of mineral constituents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other soluble materials from the soil , are found in mature wood . The composition of the mineral matter in wood depends somewhat on the environmental conditions under which the tree grew , and the location of the mineral within the tree ( 15 ) . For example , Australian grown Syncarpia laurifolia wood contains an average of 0.6% silica , whereas the same species grown in the Hawaiian Islands averages only 0.09% silica ( 5 ) . The mineral constituents are comprised chiefly of salts of calcium , potassium , and magnesium , but salts of other elements are present in smaller amounts . The acid radicals are carbonates , phosphates , silicates , sulfates , and in some cases oxalates . In addition , salts are probably formed with the acidic groups of the cell wall components . Relatively little mineral matter is extractable from wood with water , or other neutral solvents , but most of it is extractable with dilute hydrochloric acid . Crystals of calcium oxalate have been observed in Juglans , Carya , Diospyros , and Quercus , especially the live oaks ( 165 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ulmus , Celtis , Fagus , and others . Usually , the mineral components are studied by analysis of the ash which remains when the organic matter is burned at high temperatures . Woods of the temperate zone of the United States usually contain 0.2 to 0.9% , and often less than 0.5% , of ash , whereas some tropical woods contain 4 to 5% . The ash producing constituents are distributed more or less throughout the entire wood structure , as evidenced by the fact that careful ashing of microtome sections gives a pattern of the cell structure . Although the composition of the ash is variable , it is often composed of 40 to 70% calcium oxide , 10 to 30% potassium oxide , 5 to 10% magnesium oxide , and 0.5 to 2.0% ferric oxide . The oxides of manganese , aluminum , and sodium are also present , and spectroscopic analysis indicates the presence of several other metals .  | XI . Utilization In a survey of the chemical treasures of the forest , written nearly 40 years ago , emphasis was placed on the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oleoresin from the southern pines , and on seed oils ( 187 ) . A more recent survey of tree extractives indicates that several additional products have become important ( 6 ) . At present , the extractives of major commercial importance include turpentine , rosin , tall oil fatty acids , and tanning materials . Natural camphor , camphor oil , cedarwood oil , and sandalwood oil are produced , and several resins and gum are utilized . The natural dyestuffs have largely been replaced by synthetic dyes , but logwood extract is still utilized to some extent in the leather and textile industries . Other uses , such as wood ashes for fertilizer and soap making , have nearly disappeared . On the other hand , new uses for extractives will undoubtedly develop . Of potential value are the tall oil sterols , conidendrin , dihydroquercetin , and the thujaplicins . A. NAVAL , STORES AND TALI , OII . Since colonial days , oleoresin has been collected from the southern pines , and has been separated into turpentine and rosin or colophony . These products were useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been known as the naval stores industry . In the United States today , oleoresin is collected chiefly from slash and long-leaf pines . The sapwood of the living tree is scarified to permit exudation of the resinous oleoresin . Distillation then separates the volatile turpentine from the nonvolatile rosin . These products are known as gum turpentine and gum rosin , respectively . Inasmuch as the collection of oleoresin is a laborious process , other means of producing turpentine and rosin have been developed . Destructive distillation of waste pine wood produced some turpentine oils and resins , but currently this is not an important operation . Old pine stumps left from previous lumbering operations proved to be useful for the production of naval stores products . After weathering for several years , the sapwood had rotted away leaving the heartwood stump which was especially rich in resinous material . Steam distillation of the old stumps yielded turpentine and pine oil , or the same constituents and resin acids were removed by solvent ext racl ion . At  | present , stumps are extracted with a volatile solvent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rosin . The terms wood turpentine and wood rosin are used to distinguish these from the materials produced from the oleoresin . These products depend on a suitable supply of large weathered stumps which , unfortunately , is being depleted . Within the last few years , the kraft or sulfate pulping industry has become an important source of turpentine , rosin , and fatty acids ( 11 ) . In the production of southern kraft pulp , pine wood chips are cooked at about 175 ? C. with an alkaline liquor containing sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide . In the early stages of the cook , the volatile terpenes distill from the wood and are condensed from the relief gases . The crude turpentine has a disagreeable odor because of the presence of volatile sulfur compounds . Howe-v er , these can be removed by suitable refining , and the resulting sulfate turpentine is directly competitive with gum turpentine . The yields of sulfate turpentine are variable , but range up to about 0.5% , based on the original wood . The literature , up to about 1945 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the kraft cook , sodium salts of resin and fatty acids are formed . These remain in the black liquor or aqueous solution of the materials which is separated from the pulp . The black liquor is evaporated and then burned in order to recover the inorganic chemicals and the heat values from dissolved organic matter . When the black liquor is evaporated to about 25% solids , the sodium soaps of the resin and fatty acids separate from the aqueous solution in the form of " skimmings . " Acidification yields tall oil which is comprised of the free acids and some neutral materials . Crude tall oil , similar to crude sulfate turpentine , has a poor odor and a dark color attributable to impurities . Several means have been used to refine tall oil , and at present highly refined products are produced by fractional distillation under vacuum in the presence of steam ( la ) . The resin acids , as well as the fatty acids , are distilled , and acids with a light color are obtained . The separation is surprisingly good . Tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small amounts of unsaponifiables , whereas all oil fatty acids contain as little as 1% impurities . A bibliography of t he in any references to tall oil has been prepared ( 183 ) . Production data for naval stores and tall oil products are given in Table VI ( 117,174 ) . The production of gum turpentine and gum rosin  | figure has decreased steadily since 1930 , whereas that of wood turpentine , rosin , and tall oil products showed marked increases up to about 1957 . The data for dipentene and pine oil include both the natural materials from pine stumps and the materials synthesized from turpentine . The other monocyclic hydrocarbons include p-cymene and pmenthane obtained from turpentine . Rosin oil is produced by the destructive distillation of rosin . Some tall oil is still refined by treatment with 88 to 98% sulfuric acid . The strong acid removes colored materials and other impurities , and causes some dimerization of the resin and fatty acids . The dimerized acids are advantageous in the preparation of some coatings . In recent years , increasing amounts of tall oil have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more valuable products ? rosin and fatty acids . The largest use for turpentine is reported to be in the production of synthetic pine oil ( 8 ) , which in turn is used for conversion to terpin hydrate and other chemicals , as a solvent , and in ore flotation . Rather large amounts of turpentine are used in the manufacture of the insecticide toxaphene , and smaller quantities are used in paints and  | lacquers , and in the manufacture of synthetic resins and camphor . Rosin is used chiefly for sizing paper . Other uses include the preparation of chemicals , ester gums , and synthetic resins which are utilized in paints and varnishes and in the rubber industry ( 75a ) . Alkyd resins , pentaerythritol esters , and cobalt and lead soaps are prepared from the tall oil fatty acids , and these are used in the protective coating and printing ink industries . 13 . TANNING EXTRACTS Extracts of certain barks , woods , and other plant tissues have long been used for converting animal skins into leather and as natural dyes . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavy leathers are still tanned with vegetable tannins . At present , most of the natural tannins are produced from the heartwood of quebracho , which grows in South America , and from the bark of wattle trees , cultivated in South Africa . Several other extracts , including the extract of chestnut wood , are used . In the past , eastern hemlock bark and American chestnut wood were major sources of the tannins used in this country . As blight has killed most of the American chestnut trees , this source has largely been depleted , but chestnut extract is being imported from Europe . Eastern hemlock bark was important when the tanner prepared his own extract , but it has not been an important source of commercial extracts . Recent data are not at hand , but it is estimated that the current annual usage of vegetable tanning materials in the United States approximates 100,000 tons . The raw materials used for the production of tanning materials are extracted with hot water , and in the case of quebracho wood , pressure vessels are used in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The extract is evaporated to a concentrated liquid extract , or is dried to a solid material . The total extract is utilized without removal of the nontannins which are extracted along with the tannin . Tanning extracts from different sources differ considerably in their tanning action , and the tanner uses a blend of extracts in order to obtain the desired properties in the final leather . Although all of the extracts impart some color to the leather , the tanner desires an extract rr'hich does not produce dark colored leathers , and he prefers an extract , with a ratio of tannin to total solids of 0.6 , or higher .  | In addition to their use in leather manufacture , tanning extracts are used to control the viscosity of oil well drilling muds , in water treatment , and in ore flotation . The requirements in these applications differ from those of leather processing , and some extracts which are not suitable for tanning are used in drilling muds . Several domestic materials have been considered as possible sources of tanning extracts , but several factors tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tannin content must be about 6% , or higher , for a profitable extraction ; also , sufficient raw material must be potentially available at one place and at an attractive price . The extract must have a color and other characteristics that are accept able to the tanner , or it must be of value in some other applications . Western hemlock bark is potentially a source of considerable tannin , but much of the available bark is from logs which have been floated in salt water . The presence of salt is a disadvantage because it tends to precipitate tannins from the tan liquors , and iii addition hemlock extract produces leather with a reddish shade . Several oak barks contain tannin , but they have been used to only a limited extent . Most of the pine barks have a relatively low tannin content . The heartwood of the coastal redwood contains some tannin , but this has not proved to be an attractive source . Relatively small amounts of extracts prepared from redwood and western hemlock barks have been used in drilling muds . C. OTHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree exudates are commercially important . Gum arabic is obtained from Acacia senegal , the copal resins from species of Leguminosae , the dammar resins from species of Dipterocarpaceae , and the elemi resins from species of Burseraceae . The sources and uses of the natural gums and resins have been reviewed ( 89 ) . Natural rubber is from the latex of Ileum brasiliensis , and quinine is from the bark of Cinchona o , cinalis . Maple syrup and maple sugar are a limited , but interesting , utilization of the early spring sap of Acer saccharum . There are a number of other potential utilizations , but to date they have been of an experimental nature . Vegetable sterols seem to be of therapeutic value in the treatment of arteriosclerosis , and facilities are available for the production of 1000 pounds per day of pharmaceutical grade sterols from tall oil pitch ( 176 ) . The product consists  | of a mixture of 0-sitosterol and dihydro-$-sitosterol in the ratio of approximately 85:15 . A practical process is available for the isolation of conidendrin from spent pulping liquors ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark ( 120 ) . Conidendrin can be demethylated to a product known as norconidendrin , which has antioxidant properties . Dihydroquercetin has some antioxidant properties and can easily be converted to quercetin which is a more active antioxidant , and which is of potential value for pharmaceutical purposes . The natural antioxidants are of interest because of their possible use in foods . A glycoside of quercetin , known as rutin , and some citrus flavonoids have found some utilization in the treatment of capillary blood vessel disorders . The thujaplicins , which are good fungicidal agents , can be collected in dry kilns ( 62 ) or may be obtained from the spent pulping liquors from western red cedar ( 185 ) . ( REFERENCES 1 .

The General Problem The purpose of this chapter is to appraise , in chemical terms , the biological processes of growth and differentiation as they operate to form wood . Woody tissues are distinguished from nonwoody tissues by the presence of lignin ( see Chapter 6 ) , but lignified tissue is not confined to trees and shrubs ; for example , wheat and cornstalks are lignified when mature . However , from both the biological and the economic viewpoint wood formation exhibits its maximum and , perhaps , most typical development in tree trunks . The new wood formed each growing season results from the activity of a distinctly different , nonwoody kind of tissue ? the cambium . To understand I he chemical changes which take place during the development of wood from cambium , we must comprehend something of both the morphological changes ( i.e. , changes in cell shape and architecture ) , ind the physiological activity ( i.e. , the interplay of life processes and environment ) which embody or influence the chemical developments . The more obvious morphology of wood formation has been known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find their places in the sun , trees develop a gross ( visible ) differentiation into roots , trunk , and crown . The roots provide anchorage and derive water and minerals from the soil . The trunk provides the strength to support the crown . The smaller branches and twigs display the leaves to the atmosphere and sunshine , so that photosynthesis may occur ( Fig. 1 ) . This obvious Fig . I. Cross differentiation of a tree ( sehenurtic ) . differentiation is paralleled by , and in a sense is the result of , a corresponding internal differentiation of cells and tissues ( 11 ) . As noted in Chapter 2 , the new cells of the cambial zone look very much alike until they undergo morphological and chemical changes , according to the functions which they ultimately perform . Although the general pattern of differentiation is common to all trees of a species , it is not a rigidly inflexible process . Similar to f he physiology of all living organisms , a tree is influenced by its environment ? both external and internal ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or forests , the silviculturist knows that a given species exhibits its optimum ( or less than optimum ) growth , depending ripen Minerals  | the local characteristics of site , soil , stand , climate , and other external variables within its geographic range . Internally , the nutrition of a tree is maintained by the general movement of water and minerals upward from the roots to trunk , branches , and leaves , and the movement of sugars , amino acids , and other organic substances downward from the leaves in the sap stream of the inner bark . The ray cells , which lie in a horizontal , radial position , connect individual living cells with the major up and down movements of nutrients . If , for example , a very young fiber cell ( fusiform initial ) lacks sufficient contact with ray cells , its development will be impaired by a lack of nutrients . Such a cell will either die , remain functional but stunted , or subdivide and change its function by initiating new ray cells . In the latter event , its new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similar to biological studies , chemical experiments with trees can be traced far back into the history of science ; many of the earlier investigations , however , stemmed from medical or pharmaceutical interest in finding therapeutically active compounds , such as alkaloids , glucosides , tannins , oleoresins , and other extractable substances . Thus , it came about incidentally that an investigation of black locust as a poisonous plant first called attention to the inner bark as a depot of proteins ( 19,34 ) and to the probable biochemical importance of this tissue . On the other hand , the concepts of wood chemistry developed as part of the broader scientific and technical interests in agricultural products and , consequently , have been concerned chiefly with cellulose , the hemicelluloses , lignin , and other categories used by the agricultural chemist ( 18 ) . It was only rather recently that investigations of bark and wood were combined to provide a sequential analysis of the outer bark , inner bark , cambial zone , sapwood , and heartwood of one tree ( 2 ) ( see Table I ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wood and bark have a common origin , regardless of the apparent physical and chemical differences in the end products . Moreover , these analyses confirmed that there are significant chemical differences between wood and bark , and established that the composition of the cambial zone tissue is radically different from both . Specifically , the cambial tissue resembles young leaves and immature seeds , as it has a very high water content and , on a dry basis , is rich in protein and ash with very little lignin . Such chemical values are characteristic of plant tissues with high metabolic activity , and rationalize the widely observed fact of forest ecology that cambium  | figure and inner bark furnish abundant subsistence to many pathogenic microorganisms , insects , rodents , and deer . Accordingly , the general problem of the chemistry of wood formation is not merely to extend the chemical study of trees , but also to use our knowledge of their morphology and physiology in order to arrive at a better understanding of chemical composition in terms of biological structure and function . In brief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as something fixed and static , but as something potentially variable with the dynamic forces which produced it . II . Biochemical Inferences from Chemical Structure Historically , organic chemists were always interested in the metabolic products of plants and animals . As their knowledge increased , they inevitably speculated on the relations between the reactions which occur iii the laboratory and those which occur in a living organism . Laboratory reactions , however , are often very crude in comparison to the mild conditions and high specificity that characterize biological reactions . Consequently , the important contributions of organic chemical speculations have been formal , structural analogies that provide a " comparative anatomy " ( 5 ) of 1 ) I ; 1nl  | constituents , but they alone do not establish the existence of a biochemical sequence . But the recognition of formal relations and their concomitant reaction mechanisms have , in some cases , preceded by many years the development of confirmatory biochemical evidence . The organic chemistry of wood constituents should , therefore , be a very useful guide to biochemical studies of wood formation and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describes the structures of starch and cellulose solely in terms of glucose units , one would infer that these carbohydrates are synthesized by the tree from glucose . Without biological evidence one might be tempted to infer also that these two polysaccharides have similar functions , whereas they are actually quite different . The cellulose is a long , linear-chain polymer with the glucoside linkages in the beta configuration ; it is generally a permanent structural unit in the build-up of the plant . Starch , however , consists of both linear and branched polymers , with the glucoside linkage in the alpha configuration ; it functions as a reserve food which is stored or hydrolyzed again for mobilization and metabolic use , depending upon the physiologic needs of the plants . Similarly , the fact that the hemicelluloscs can be hydrolyzed to simple sugars has been taken to indicate that they are synthesized from the sugars . The supposition is that mannans are derived from mannose , the galactans from galactose , the xylans from xylose , and the arahinans from arabinose . More commonly , the hemicelluloscs appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derivat ives . In these instances , the synthetic reactions in the plant can not follow quite so simple a pattern as when a single sugar is present . Moreover , glucose and xylose , and galactose and arabinose are stereochemically related . Accordingly , from the standpoint of structure it is also conceivable that xylans may originate from glucose , and nrabinans from galactose , to form the respective pentoses , through an initial loss of the number 6 carbon atom in the hexoses . The pectic acids are linear macromolecules composed of galact'ironic acid units . In conformity with the preceding inferences , one would assume that the pectic acids are built up by the plant from g ; Ilnctnronic acid molecules . But it is also possible to think that oxidation of the number 6 carbon atoms in a preformed galactan would lead to the same end product . Since the pectins and protopeel in are more or less completely methylated , they pose the further question of whet her the methyl ester groups are formed after the  | macromolecule has been synthesized , or whether galacturonic acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noteworthy that with the exception of the hypothetical oxidation of galactan to pectic acid , the inferred syntheses of these macromolecules all depend upon a single type of reaction intermolecular dehydration . The reverse reaction , hydrolysis , also takes place ; for example , the amylases bring about the solubilization of starch . It is thought that the hemicelluloses are hydrolyzed when they serve as reserve food materials , and that the initial breakdown even of cellulose , in decay , is by hydrolytic enzymes . The reaction-type may be expressed as : 2 ( C , II ? O , ) OH = ( C6H , , 0 , ) ? 0 ( C , Hi3O , ) + H0 O ( 1 ) By analogy to laboratory reactions , it seems plausible that the plant synthesis of many esters proceeds basically as a reaction which produces water as a by-product . Significant instances for wood chemistry , in addition to the above pectic ( galacturonic ) esters , are the fats , the gallotannins , and the esters associated with volatile oils or other extractives . Another especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amino acids . As in the dehydration reactions leading to the polysaccharides , all of these reactions are reversible and the degradations are catalyzed by appropriate hydrolytic enzymes . ItCOOH + HOR ' RCOOR ' + H0 ( 2 ) RCII ( NH , ) COOH + R'CH(NI)COOII RCH(NH2)CO ? NH ? CH ( R ' ) COOH + H2O ( 3 ) A very different type of reaction was indicated in the formal deduction that the carbon chains of the fatty acids are synthesized by the condensation of acetic acid molecules or some two-carbon atom equivalent . At the time this inference was first stated , the analogous laboratory synthesis employed sodium ethoxide and absolute alcohol . Obviously , those reaction conditions were very remote from those in a living plant . Nonetheless , it has been established recently that the synthesis of fatty acids proceeds through acetyl-coenzyme-A , which provides the necessary energy of activation in a much less drastic manner than the Claisen condensation . Conversely , the biochemical degradation of the fatty acids does not proceed by hydrolysis , but by oxidation , predominantly at the beta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another structural concept having far-reaching consequences is that the carbon skeleton of the compounds belonging to the terpene series can , with few exceptions , be regarded as being derived from the condensation of isoprene units . This concept has related such apparently diverse compounds as the terpenes , camphors , resin acids , rubber , the carotenoids , and sterols . ( For structural formulas see Chapter 7 ) . On the other hand , the usual methods of organic chemistry failed to elucidate the structure of lignin , and hence have not provided comparable inferences about its synthesis in the plant . Instead , biochemical products formed by the enzymatic oxidation of coniferyl alcohol , eugenol , and other phenols have been used to support speculation about the structure of lignin . III . Composition of Developing Wood Logically , one of the first steps to support a biochemical premise derived from structural organic chemistry is to find out whether , in a given species , the trees actually contain the postulated substances . For example , if we assume that cellulose is derived from glucose , we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells which are forming cellulose . This thought directs attention to the chemical composition of developing woody tissues . In this context it is convenient , though arbitrary , to regard the constituents of a living cell in three categories : ( 1 ) the generally low-molecular weight substances dissolved in the cytoplasm , ( 2 ) the higher molecular weight substances which form the cell wall , and ( 3 ) the proteins which are present in the nucleus and cytoplasm . To date , very little is known . specifically of the proteins in cambial tissues ; hence , they will be mentioned only incidentally . A. METHODS OF COLLECTION It should be evident that the first problem is to collect material which is botanically authentic . The chemist who is not thoroughly conversant with the identification of trees and tissues should in-  | variably turn to a competent botanist for verification . Particularly , when the chemist does his own collecting , he should take auxiliary materials which will enable a botanist to check authenticity . A tree usually can be identified by its leaves in summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anatomy of the wood . Such specimens should be taken and properly labeled and preserved at the time each tree is felled or otherwise sampled . Since the growth of a tree is intimately related to its environment , it is usually desirable to record additional biological ( or biometric ) data such as the place , date , site , soil , height , age , and other pertinent facts . Obtaining satisfactory materials for biochemical studies involves additional considerations , which have led to a variety of procedures which may be grouped into two categories : ( 1 ) those which seek to obtain directly only the sap-soluble constituents , and , ( 2 ) those which depend first on removing the desired tissue and then on separating the cytoplasmic from the cell wall components . Plant physiologists , who are concerned with the transport of nutrients and related problems , have often relied on procedures in the first group , whereas chemists have been prone to employ the second . 1 . Collection of Sap Plowing sap . A few woody plants , notably sugar maple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain a flow of sap . Wood sap . The wood ( xylem ) sap which fills the conducting vessels has been obtained by applying a vacuum to one end of a cut stem ( 6 ) , or by displacing it with water under pressure ( 26 ) . Bark sap . Incisions into the inner bark yield small quantities of the phloem sap . A unique procedure is to decapitate aphids which have been feeding on young twigs and to collect the exudation from the stylets left in situ ( 29 ) . 2 . Collection of Tissue Microdissection . With a microscope and a micromanipulator thin sections of wood can be separated into their component tissues . Macrodissection . Various procedures have been used to obtain samples of developing wood which permit analysis by established methods . In the following sequence of materials , adapted from Sultze ( 38 ) , the extent of lignification is taken as a rough index of tissue development :  | u . Xylem scrapings ( X. Sc. ) , a watery suspension of tissue fragments ; ideally , it would be devoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , translucent ribbons ; about 5% of the total Fig. 2 . Active csnihiunn , summer . Cross section . a , AID ! roxineitions only . Quaking aspen .  | lignin has been deposited . ( Estimates of lignification are based on analyses of P. tremuloides in 1957. ) c . Stringy xylem ( Str . X. ) , semiwoody , tends to break down into stringy fibers ; about 20% of the lignin has been deposited . d . New xylem ( e.g. , ' 57X ) , woody , curls when cut with spokeshave ; about 50% of the lignin has been deposited . e . Year old xylem ( e.g. , ' 56X ) , woody ; fully lignified . Figure 2 shows the approximate location of these materials , and the changes in their cross-sectional appearance as they develop from the original dividing cells in the cambium into wood . Satisfactory sequences of materials have been obtained from the aspens ( Populus tremuloides Michx. and P. grandidentata Michx. ) , sugar maple ( Ater saccharum Marsh. ) , jack pine ( Pinus banksiana Lamb ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soft xylem has been obtained from white and yellow birches ( Betula papyrifera Marsh. , B. lutea Michx. f. ) , and American elm ( Llmus americans L. ) . B. CYTOPLASMIC CONSTITUENTS Turning now to the results of chemical investigations of materials collected by such procedures , Table II attempts to indicate the cytoplasmic constituents which have been found in developing woody tissues and the trees from which they were obtained . Although it is very important for the plant physiologist to determine whether or not a given constituent is located in a moving sap stream , because this fact has a bearing on the problem of translocation , the distinction has less significance for the plant chemist . Presumably , the constituent would be available for metabolism iii either event . Consequently the table does not indicate the method of collection ; but , iii each instance , the constituents have been derived from metabolically active outer wood , inner bark , or young twigs . The numerous extractives obtained from whole bark or wood , leaves , and roots have been excluded . Inspection of Table II shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood and inner bark than any other constituent . It is often accompanied by glucose and fructose , but apparently not in the relationship of invert sugar . In the context of general plant physiology , these facts suggest that the sucrose is in enzymatic equilibrium with starch the sucrose functioning as a soluble carbohydrate reserve , whereas the starch is an insoluble carbohydrate reserve of the tree . Although not usually reported in  | wood analyses , it is known from microscopy that starch is very commonly found in trees . Equally noteworthy is the absence of the so-called typical wood sugars arabinose , xylose , galactose , and mannose . Likewise , there is no report of either galacturonic or glucuronic acids , which are characteristic of the pectic acids and the aldobiouronic acids of the hemicelluloses , respectively . The absence of the sugars and uronic acids which structurally make up the hemicelluloses and pectic substances may indicate that present methods of detection have not been perfected sufficiently , or it may have some significance in relation to the biochemical pathways by which these substances are built-up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free state , it is present in combined form in the tri- and tetrasaccharides , raffinose , and stachyose . Each contains the structural equivalent of sucrose , and the third and fourth hexose units are galactose . These oligosaccharides occur in the phloem sap and seem to indicate that the galactose is formed in the leaves and is transported in combined form through the inner bark to the places where it is required . Not many chemical analyses have been directed to detecting the usual di- or polycarboxylic acids . However , microscopic inspection has revealed calcium oxalate crystals as a widespread deposit in ray cells and the crystalliferous strands . Oxalic acid was formerly regarded as the next to the last stage of oxidation in the metabolism of carbohydrates . Since oxalic acid is a very strong acid , it may be assumed to have a toxic effect if its concentration exceeds a certain minimum ; hence , it was inferred that the calcium oxalate crystals , so often seen under the microscope , represented a mechanism for rendering oxalic acid nontoxic . It is equally plausible , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calcium from the fluids of the tree . Another calcium salt , commonly known as maple sand because it precipitates in the boiling down of maple sap to maple syrup , contains L-malic acid as its major component , together with lesser amounts of citric , fumaric , and succinic acids . These four acids are prominent members of the so-called Krebs or citric acid cycle in respiration . It would be interesting to examine the cambial zone of other species for the occurrence of members of the citric acid cycle . It might also be worthwhile investigating whether the oxalic acid is derived from the keto-acids or this series , for example oxaloacetic acid . As would be expected of actively growing tissues , nitrogenous  | compounds in the form of amino acids have been reported . The indications of proteins and enzymes would be limited to exudates or to other materials specifically prepared for the purpose of detecting them . The usual preservative extraction with dehydrating solvents , such as strong alcohol , would insolubilize most proteins and enzymes . The amino acids , phenylalanine , and tyrosine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed separately because of their importance to current theories of the biogenesis of lignin . Of the so-called amides , asparagine and glutamine have been long known to participate in the storage and transport of nitrogen . Allantoin and allantoic acid apparently have similar functions . Citrulline also seems to be a form in which nitrogen is stored ; in addition , it is closely related to the important amino acid , arginine . As is true of nitrogen , the inorganic ash constituents are important to the metabolism of the plant , but unlike nitrogenous compounds , have received little attention in forest trees . The remaining compounds , with the exception of benzoic acid , may be looked upon as phenolic substances which are more or less related to current concepts of the biosynthesis of lignin . Only in the case of quaking aspen has any significant number of intermediates been detected , and even when taken in the aggregate they constitute but a very minor percentage of the total soluble solids of lignifying tissues . Perhaps the most that can be said is that at present we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequence . Even the recorded occurrences of coniferin and syringin are still few in comparison with the known distribution of sucrose , and they may be considered as trivial in relation to the number of tree-forming plant species . In brief , the soluble constituents of cytoplasm that have been isolated undoubtedly give us important glimpses into the initial stages in the metabolic processes of wood formation . Obviously , more comprehensive and systematic observations must be carried out in order to reveal the continuity of the reactions by which a tree builds its structure out of the primary products of photosynthesis . C. CELL WALL COMPONENTS From the standpoint of the pulp and paper industry , interest in the chemist ry of wood format ion centers primarily on the chemistry of cell wall format ion . Although the various pulping operations produce fibers with diverse properties , the pulped fibers retain , more or less  | intact , the cell walls laid down when the wood was formed . Figures 3 and 4 ( 23 ) give the data obtained in efforts to further investigate the development of cell walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures the progressive or sequential stages of development are arbitrarily spaced along the horizontal axis , the youngest or least lignified stage being first ( left ) and the fully lignified or year-old xylem being last ( right ) . Each graphic point is the averaged analyt-figure ical result for all samples of each tissue . To obtain these samples 22 trees were felled in the course of 6 collection periods between May 20th and September 5th . Not all stages of wood development were available at each collection period ; for example , ' 57 xylem had not been laid down in sufficient quantity before May 20th , and xylem scrapings could not be collected after June 15th . It is evident that the percentages of some constituents diminish , whereas others increase , as the cell matures . Particular significance may be attached to the fact that the values for uronic anhydride , galactan , and arabinan decline more or less steadily . These three compounds constitute the pectic complex referred to by both the botanist and the food chemist . According to the botanist , they also  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cements adjacent cell walls and which , possibly , was fonned at the time when the first boundary ( cell plate ) was created between two new cells in the last stages of cell division . At present , the consensus seems to be  | that these pectic materials are not transformed into other substances during the subsequent differentiation of the cells ( 8,21 ) . If this is so , it can be assumed that the percentage diminution of the pectic constituents is proportional to the weight of other materials deposited in figure the cell wall during growth and differentiation . On this premise , the percentage of pectic materials in very young tissue ( e.g. , xylem scrapings ) can be used as an internal index to the subsequent increments in the dry weight of the other constituents ( 38 ) . Of the three pectic materials , the pectic acid ( structurally a polygalacturonic anhydride )  | is the most abundant , and hence , would be preferred as a basis for the internal index calculations . Currently , however , there is no standard routine analytic method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid and the glucuronic acid which is associated with the xylan . Accordingly , the calculations are based on an average of the values for galactan and arabinan in the xylem scrapings . Figures 5 and 6 ( 23 ) show the result of recalculating  | the percentage composition of each growth stage into gram-weight composition relative to 100 grams of xylem scraping tissue . In this perspective , the trends in composition were significantly different . Of the l0 components assayed , only protein and ash fell below their original levels . Even so , no significant decline occurred until after the tissue had become sufficiently differentiated to have acquired a definite woody texture . Stated somewhat differently , these components maintained their original level during cell enlargement and the initial stages of differentiation . They declined irr the later stages of differentiation when the major synthesis of cellulose , lignin , and hemicelluloses brought about the thickening of the cell walls and their impregnation with lignin . In the aggregate , the net result was a 9- or 10-fold increase in dry weight from the xylemscraping stage to year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a given component to its total relative weight in mature wood , showed that the amount of Oilcan deposited increased in each growth increment . Analogous trends were observed for mannan and lignin , and less consistently for xylan and nonlignin methoxyl . Roughly , one-third of the uronic anhydride was deposited in the xylem-scrapings stage , one-fourth in the ' 57 ? ' 56 xylem stage , and lesser fractions in the intervening stages . By assumption , all of the arabinan and galactan was considered to have been deposited in the xylem scrapings stage . This is not strictly valid ; some arabinose is associated with the xylans and galactose with other hemicelluloses . However , the amounts are relatively small iii hardwoods . This is not true of conifers . Comparisons of the increments of each component to the corresponding cell wall increments within the several growth stages indicated that cellulose was always the predominant single component . But it accounted for only 35% of the xylem scrapings stage , whereas it constituted 50 to 60% of the cell wall increments in all subsequent stages ( protein and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cellulose in the first stage ; the xylan ranked second in the soft-xylem and stringy-xylem stages ; lignin was second in the ' 57 and ' 56 xylem stages . If one assumes that cell wall thickening occurs only by deposition of materials on the interior surface of the cell wall , one can argue that the content of cellulose , mannan , and xylan increases from the exterior to the interior layers . However , morphological evidence clearly indicates that lignin is deposited within the previously formed cat-Ito-  | hydrates which constitute the external layers of the cell wall . Hence , at this stage it would be the better part of wisdom to accept statements about cell wall gradients with a degree of reservation . The chemistry of cell wall development in young tracheid cells from Pinus sylvestris has also been studied . Tissues , which represented five stages in a cell wall growth , were discernible in radial , longitudinal sections when viewed through a polarizing microscope , and were separated for microanalysis with a microlnanipulator . The results of this work are given in Chapters 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of the dry matter in a tree , whether it is in the form of major constituents such as cellulose and lignin or as minor extractives , is derived from the carbon and energy which is made available by photosynthesis . The organic compounds formed by photosynthesis , together with the energy they contain , may enter metabolic pathways directly , or they may be transformed into reserve nutrients , e.g. , starch . In either event , transformation of the photosynthetic products will depend upon coupled reactions . The term coupled reactions refers to one or more reactions which proceeds with the liberation of energy that is transferred to another reaction , or set of reactions , which absorbs energy . Such reactions are designated as exergonic and endergonic reactions , respectively , and occur more or less simultaneously . In many instances , such coupled reactions proceed in small stages , with many more intermediate compounds than the organic chemist is apt to deal with in the ordinary laboratory synt hesis or degradation . The energy changes in a given step of a biochemical reaction are correspondingly small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one intermediate to the next . Table III shows the heat of combustion of typical plant constituents and , to the extent that the heat of combustion exceeds that of a carbohydrate , the difference may be regarded as a measure of the energy which coupled reactions have transferred from carbohydrates into the synthesis of other substances . It is generally recognized that both proteins and fats are richer in energy than carbohydrates , but reference is seldom made to the fact that lignin as well as terpenes , waxes , and some other " extractives " also are energy rich . Such therniochemical relations , together with inferences from  | structure and from tissue composition , provide a valuable source of research ideas and criteria . The assertion that a given biochemical reaction actually occurs during wood formation requires substantiation by evidence that can only be derived more directly from living tissues . Over the years very comprehensive pathways of plant metabolism have been proposed and extensively supported by experiment . Except for studies on lignification , very little work of this kind has been done with trees . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller organisms : bacteria , yeast , molds , or algae . To begin with , scientists hesitated to generalize to higher plants the knowledge gained from microorganisms . However , the viewpoint has become rather generally accepted that many basic mechanisms are similar in plants and animals . Figure 7 , which is a greatly oversimplified , schematic diagram , may help the reader to gain an elementary picture of the chemical origins of plant constituents . The pectic substances , i.e. , pectic acid , galactan , and arabinan are prominent components of the middle lamella and primary wall , and are supposed to originate from D-galacturonic acid , galactose , and arabinose , respectively . As yet there is no direct evidence that these simple carbohydrate compounds exist , as such , in cambial cells . However , small amounts of raffinose and stachyose , which contain galactose , have been detected in the phloem sap of some trees . Apparently very little is known about the precursors of the pectic substances and the biochemical reactions which construct the middle lamellae Cellulose is quantitatively the dominant cell wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it is regarded chemically as a pure glucose polysaccharide , and inasmuch as glucose ? either free or in the form of sucrose ? is commonly present in developing woody tissues , it seems logical that glucose is a direct precursor of cellulose . Actually , glucose marked with C14 has been incorporated into the cellulose of cotton hairs ( 16 ) , Acetobacter xylinum ( 17 ) , and wheat stem ( 7 ) . Current opinion holds that the enzymatic reaction proceeds through glucose phosphates , e.g. , uridine-diphosphoglucose , ( CGIh1O5 ) O(H2P05)O(C5H703) ? C4H2N202  | which contain energy necessary for the synthesis of the glucoside linkages of the cellulose chain . A chromatographic indication of organic phosphate was noted in soft xylem extractives of quaking aspen ( 38 ) , but it was not characterized . An alternate mechanism is cellulose formation by transglycosidation of sucrose . Recently , glucose has been found in a lipid fraction produced by Acetobacter and may also be a cellulose precursor in this form . 2 ( C ? Ii ? OS ) O(C1L05) + I1.0 ( C611 ? O6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ( Glucose ) ( Fructose ) ( ( ; hicose ) ( Glucose ) Fructose Although cellulose is idealized as containing only glucose , it is extremely difficult to prepare even a cotton cellulose which does not yield mannose on hydrolysis . Consequently , it has become a debatable question whether the small amounts of mannose observed represented mannan residues , were an artifact created by the acid hydrolysis , or were structurally a part of the cellulose macromolecule ( 27 ) . Although the premise that cellulose originates from glucose in the cell sap does not present any difficulty from the standpoint of structural organic chemistry , the mechanics of how an enzyme , itself a macromolecule , can construct a linear cellulose molecule containing 300 or more glucose units is more difficult to visualize . In developing cotton fibers , x-ray diagrams did not show the characteristics of the native cellulose crystal lattice until about 25 days after flowering . Although cellulose is present in earlier stages , it was not revealed by this property without prior extraction of wax and , in the very immature stages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In view of the association of wax deposits with cellulose , reference may be made to the occurrence of a " lipid glucoside " in Acetobacter cultures ( 9 ) . On the other hand , some water soluble gums contain cellulose , but whether the apparent solubility of the cellulose is due to colloidal dispersion or to chemical combination with more soluble carbohydrates is unknown . Such observations seem to indicate transitional forms or states of cellulose . Even more provocative is the fact that mature tobacco pith cells have been induced by proper conditions of tissue cultures to renew their growth without cell division . This enlargement was not merely swelling as a result of water uptake , because there was an increase in the dry weight of the cell wall materials ( 32 ) ( cf. Table IV ) . How was the newly formed cellulose laid down ? plectron micrographs p 391 TABLE 1V " Deposition of Cell Wall Components , Dr Weights ( in milligrams ) Tobacco Pith , Growth without Cell Division ( 32 ) figure liolocellulose less pectic substance and protein . show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is this structure sufficiently elastic to expand as required ? Is the new cellulose laid down as an additional film or lamella of meshed microfibrils on the inner surface of the older cell wall material ? Or , are the interfibrillar spaces enlarged by the growth process and new microfibrils created to fill the voids ? A recent attempt ( 36 ) to stun up the physical , chemical , and biological evidence assumes " . . . that both molecules and microfibrils grow in length at the same time and at the same point , viz. , at the top of a microfibril . Acre one or more molecules of the cellulose synthesizing enzyme are supposed to be engaged in detaching glucose monomers from some high energy precursor and transferring these monomers to the ends of the ( cellulose ) molecules . . . The enzyme might be localized . . . with higher plants on the inside of the wall and , in primary walls , probably also in the interior of the wall . " Botanists have sought , for many years , to find a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the synthesis of cellulose in the same way that plastids account for the synthesis of starch . During the 1930 's such plastid-like bodies were reported to have been discovered in the large , single-celled algae , I'alonia and ffalicystis , and their presence to have been established subsequently in developing cotton hairs ( 13 ) . According to these observations , the cellulose was synthesized within the plastid , evolving IIirough liquid , jell , and solid states . The plastids even-  | tually ruptured and , depending on the species , liberated the cellulose in the form of either granules or fibrils which were still encumbered with a portion of the plastid matrix . Finally , the cellulosic material was incorporated into the cell wall . These morphological observations were supported by phenomena revealed by polarized light , x-ray diagrams , and chemical treatments . Subsequently , these descriptions and interpretations were criticized and have been largely supplanted by the revelations of the electron microscope . Nonetheless , students of submicroscopic morphology are trying to relate the granular reticulum of the cytoplasm to enzymatic processes . The basic question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigators is still valid and is still unanswered . The deposition of lignin occurs within the existing framework of the cell wall and , accordingly , is regarded as a filling or cementing process . However , lignification and cell wall construction are not mutually exclusive processes in the composite metabolism of a cell . Deposition of lignin in the outer wall may start while the secondary wall is being formed , as is shown very clearly in the accompanying photomicrographs ( see Figs. 8 and 9 ) ( 41 ) . In the case of the tobacco pith cells mentioned above , the process of enlarging the cell proceeded in spite of the fact that the cell walls had been somewhat liguified . In general , however , lignification must be regarded as a stabilizing process helping to make the woody cell stronger and more durable . Current concepts of lignification regard coniferyl alcohol as the primary building unit , and state that the processes of dehydrogenation and polymerization transform this monomer into the complex figure  | figure crossed nicols ( upper ) , showing the relation between cell wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cell number , counted from a point judged to be the cambium . ( After Wardrop , X 430. ) polymer . Historically , this idea developed from three facts : the isolation of the glucoside coniferin from some conifers , the similarity in the elementary analyses of coniferyl alcohol and isolated lignin , and the tendency of coniferyl alcohol to resinify . Spruce lignin is thought to conform most nearly to this concept and , consequently , is regarded as the prototype for other lignins . In the case of the hardwood lignins , sinapyl and coumaryl alcohols participate with coniferyl alcohol in the formation of lignin . In conformity with the principle that lignin must originate with the products of photosynthesis , the biochemical origin of coniferyl alcohol has been related to the simple sugars by analogy to the microbial metabolism of glucose via sedoheptulose , shikimic , and prephenic acids to phenylalanine and tyrosine . Biochemical reactions which would convert tyrosine into coniferyl alcohol via ferulic acid appear analogous to many transformations which occur in respiration and in the synthesis of carbohydrates ( Fig. 10 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lignification has much appeal because many steps are consistent with the generalities of plant metabolism ( 1,33 ) . Evidence in favor of the proposed pathway has been sought by  | Radioactive precursors of coniferyl alcohol , e.g. , shikimic acid , phenylalanine , ferulic acid , and numerous other materials have been similarly tested . Organic chemists have expended a great amount of energy , ingenuity , and time in synthesizing compounds with radioactive carbon atoms in known positions within the molecule , in order to reveal the pathways to lignin . Parallel to the syntheses of the starting materials has been the necessary elaboration of quantitative degradation procedures to recover the radioactivity from the lignin , or more particularly , from the vanillin , the " Hibbert ketones , " or other lignin fragments . The radioactive compounds have been administered to the plant in various ways ? solid substances have been implanted under the bark , whereas solutions have been injected aseptically or they have been absorbed through the freshly cut ends of stems or tips . Radioautographs have been used to localize the introduced materials , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to have been sequestered by rapidly developing and lignifying cells . Proof that the absorbed radioactivity actually was incorporated into the lignin generally rested upon the assumption that the extraction of the tissue with solvents , such as alcohol , benzene , and water ( in which the incorporated materials are soluble under laboratory conditions ) removed all materials not converted to lignin . In some instances , whole tissues were subjected to lignin degradation reactions to recover radioactivity . In others , isolated lignins were first prepared by conventional methods . The resulting data have been regarded not only as proof that coniferyl alcohol participated directly in lignin synthesis , but also as a validation of the sequence starting from glucose . Comparable studies have been made with sinapyl alcohol and parahydroxycinnamyl alcohol to extend the concept to hardwoods . Further affirmation has been found in researches which attempted to simulate Iignification in vitro by subjecting coniferyl alcohol and related compounds to the action of enzymes or inorganic catalysts ( 15 ) . Consequently , the proposed pathways as a whole , and the dehydrogenation ? polymerization of coniferyl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general credence ( 40 ) . There still are , however , unanswered questions . As maturing wood l issues carry on a variety of chemical syntheses , introduced radioactive chemicals obviously can enter any of the available pathways of metabolism , some of which do not terminate in lignification . Hence , it has been assumed that the greater the radioactivity re-
