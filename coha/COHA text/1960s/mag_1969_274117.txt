No civilian politician has wielded significant power in South Viet Nam since President Ngo Dinh Diem was over thrown in 1963 . A succession of generals and military juntas , in or out of uniform , has ruled the country . Civilian ministers have held office but not authority . Premier Tran Van Huong , appointed in May 1968 , was no exception . Last week the affable Huong , who enjoys wide popularity among the Vietnamese people , lost what little power he had . President Nguyen Van Thieu replaced him with General Tran Thien Khiem , 43 , the hard-eyed minister in charge of police and pacification . <P> Rumors of a government reshuffle had been circulating in Saigon for months . Having said that he was willing to com pete openly with the Communists ' political arm , the National Liberation Front , Thieu was expected to broaden the makeup of his Cabinet in an effort to match the Front 's strong appeal to peas ants and intellectuals . But in firing Huong , a politically independent civilian , and replacing him with a soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rather than broadening its base , Thieu 's government was limiting its leadership to military men . Later appointments could , of course , give the regime a more heterogeneous character . For the time being , though , there was no room at the top for civilians . <P> Waning Influence . Khiem , who was involved in the overthrow of Diem and masterminded two subsequent coupplots , joins Thieu and Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky , previously the air-force chief , to form an all-military triumvirate . They are expected to take an uncompromising political line at home and at the Paris peace talks . <P> South Viet Nam 's malleable Parliament had set the stage for Huong 's removalby claiming that his economic and anticorruption policies were ineffective . To be sure , Huong was an indifferent administrator , a homey type who grows roses and readily admits : " I have never been a revolutionary . " Moreover , he is aging ( 66 ) and ailing ( asthma , rheumatism ) . Huong 's personal shortcomings were not , however , what brought about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Premier about major issues for months , apparently wanted a man in whom he had complete confidence to help him through the next political stage in Viet Nam . <P> U.S. diplomats had strongly urged Thieu to retain a civilian front for his government . Not long ago , such advice might have been swiftly heeded . But with U.S. troops beginning to withdraw , American influence in Saigon is waning and bound to decline further . Former Defense Secretary Clark Clifford wrote recently in Foreign Affairs quarterly that Viet Nam 's " political realities are , in the final analysis , both beyond our control and beyond our ken . " In putting together his new government , Thieu could prove that point emphatically . His decisions might not only be beyond the control or comprehension of the U.S. but might also prove distasteful to it .
