CRIME With his china-blue eyes , wavy white hair and deferential manner , William Dale Archerd , 55 , is the very antithesis of a Bluebeard . If the Los Angeles County district attorney 's office is right however , the sometime hearing-aid salesman 's penchant for marriage was matched only by his preference for murder . Last week he was in jail facing charges that he killed his nephew and two of his seven wives ; the investigation also implicated him in the deaths of a third wife and two male friends . The suspected weapon : insulin. * The list of Archerd 's wives , relatives and acquaintances who have died after manifesting symptoms of insulin poisoning is indeed striking . The first was William Jones Jr. , 34 , in 1947 , who died the day after Archerd paid a visit to his hospital sickbed . The motive , if any , is unknown . The second-and certainly the weirdest case-was that of bride No. 4 , Zella , 48 , who died in 1956 . Two months after their marriage , Archerd told police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered their house . With guns in one hand , hypodermic needles in the other , said Archerd , they injected both himself and Zella with a drug , then made off with $500 in cash , overlooking jewelry and other valuables . Archerd was unaffected by the unsought medication , but his wife went from convulsions into a coma and died . If they found anything odd in such a story , Covina police found no cause for arrest . Kindly Uncle William . The third unfortunate , in 1958 , was Juanita Plum Archerd , wife No. 5 . Two days after their marriage in Las Vegas , Juanita was taken to the hospital , suffering from what was described as an overdose of barbiturates . She died the next day of a condition that looked strangely like insulin poisoning . Frank Stewart , 54 , was the fourth , in 1960 . Taken to the hospital after apparently faking a fall in an airport rest room to collect on insurance , Stewart was visited by the ever-solicitous Archerd-and died after the usual convulsions that night . Archerd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At about this time , Archerd 's brother Everett died at his job , and Archerd and his mother were entrusted with $5,000 for Everett 's son , Burney , 15 . In August 1961 , Burney was taken to the hospital , where he reported that he had been hit by a car , though an investigation showed no such accident had taken place . Burney nonetheless remained in the hospital , where he was visited by his kindly Uncle William . He died soon thereafter . Symptoms : those of insulin poisoning . Archerd 's mother , co-trustee of the $5,000 , herself died three weeks later of causes not disclosed by the investigation .
