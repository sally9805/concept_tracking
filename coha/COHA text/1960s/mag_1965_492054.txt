It was getting dark , and I was beginning to sober up a little when we pulled up in hack of the " safe " house . It was the same kind of place we had over in the American sector ? a big , stucco house in a nice residential suburb , shut off by trees and bushes from the houses around it . Like ours , it was a good place to take a defector to question him when he slipped over from East Berlin . The only difference was that this house was in East Berlin  --  in the Weissensee district , by a lake they called the White Sea . And the guys in the car with me were not my old airmen buddies of the Office of Special Investigation but members of the East German secret police . And this time I was the guy who was crossing over , the one who was going to be put under the microscope . We stopped by an iron gate in a high iron fence . There were three German shepherd dogs in the yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horn , and a guy who must have been a caretaker came out and grabbed the dogs by their collars and locked them in a garage that stood over at the side . Then the black sedan pulled in through the narrow gate , and the guy in the back seat with me , a little blue-eyed guy with brown , thinning hair , who said his name was Karl , told me in German , " OK , get out . " So we got out of the car at some steps and went up to a small landing . I took a quick look around , and behind the high shrubbery and the trees I could see , two , three hundred yards away , the rooftops of other houses . It was a very isolated place . I bill in Kali in , and the lithe ' eiiv hollowed nor ; 1 chunky , flu lv-Iran rd guy . the duty ' with the I ; eimaii secret police a ho hall come to lack me up when I telephoned to say I wanted to defect . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Oriental rugs . into a norm that I guess was a sort of upstairs sitting room with a sun porch that looked out over the lake . They told me to sit down , and a guy named Mielke came in . He asked me did I want something to drink , and 1 did . for it had been about two hours since I lest the bar in West Berlin , But I said , " Neth " ? I was speaking German with them  --  for I was beginning to worry a little , and I figured I better lay off the booze . Pretty soon a housekeeper came up , bringing coffee and sandwiches , and we ate them , and another guy came in and asked me for my documents , and I handed them over , and he took them off , I guess to photograph them . Anyhow , in a little while , he brought them back . T hen they started asking me a lot of questions . They asked me who I was . and what I did in the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thompson , Airman First Class , and I was a clerk in the tile room of the O.S.I. at Tempelhof Air Base in West Berlin . All of which they knew already , because they 'd already published my picture in the East German paper Neucs Deutschland  --  the Communist Party paper , it showed me and some other 0.5.1. guys in a bar , and the caption under it said , " Beware ! These people are Americans who recruit spies . " So they knew who I was , all right . They kept asking me why I 'd come over , and I told them I wanted political asylum . I was disgusted with my life in the American Air Force . I was tired of the liberties the American Government was taking with the working class , meaning the liberties it had taken with me  --  a regular airman . Like making me send the German girl I 'd married back to the States . For let 's face it . If you are an enlisted man in the military , you are working class all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I was n't kidding . I meant it . They asked me a lot of other questions  --  who my commander was , what the chain of command in my organization was , what my duties were exactly . They asked me about a lot of people in my organization  --  what their drinking and sex habits were . By this time the coffee and the sandwiches had sobered me up pretty good , and I was getting pretty tense and tight . My belly was in a knot . I realized I had done a damn-fool thing . and I was trying to figure how I was going to get out of it . So I held hack a little , not cooperating too much . So finally they said . " Look , it 's im ? possible for us to give you political asylum . You must first prove your worth by going to work for us . You must go hack , and we will give you instructions what to do . " I did n't even argue with them . I just said OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop me from going hack to the West and never seeing these guys aeain ? We talked till l - 30 in the morning . Then I went In hell in a big 1 ? Kiiii across the hall , but I did n't sleep for a lone time . I lay there arid thought . what Ha , hell am I going to do . how ant I going to get out of this thing ? I was really wound tight , I tell you , really afraid . Net morning they talked to me again . Told me to meet them on the following Wednesday night at the Warsaw Bridge . I said OK , but I knew damn well I was n't going to do it . They took me down to the S-Bahn , the elevated station , and I waited , to see if I was being followed , until the conductor hollered , " All Aboard . " Then I jumped on the last car . When I got on that train headed back to the West , I felt light . I felt born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute we got to the first station in the West , which is Sonnenallee . I felt I was safe , and free , no problems . I got off at the Hermannstrasse station and got a taxi  --  two or three taxis in fact . which was my training  --  and went hack to Tempethof . I shaved , took off the old civilian corduroys , jacket and striped shirt I had been wearing , and got back into uniform , and Monday morning I went back to work in the tile room . But tell you this . I was jumpy . Every time the phone would ring I 'd about go through the ceiling , and when the colonel would call me into his office for something , I 'd break out in a sweat . I was more and more ashamed of what I had done . and more and more determined I was n't going to meet Karl on Wednesday night at Warsaw Bridge . And I did n't . I stayed around my quarters all that day , and for two or three days after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay cooped up on the base all the time , so pretty soon started going out again , seeing this girl Ushy I 'd met after my wife left Berlin . For about two weeks nothing happened . Then one night . early , I was walking up Columbiadamm , which is a street that runs by the base , headed for the Manhattan Bar . This D. K. W. sedan passes and pulls in to the curb , and this guy Karl jumps out , and said , " Tommy , get in the car . " And he showed a small automatic pistol , similar to those Belgian jobs . He did n't point it or stick it in my ribs or anything , he just showed it . So I got in the car and the driver made a U-turn right there on Columbiadamm and cut back into Soviet territory . There was no trouble crossing then , for that was in June of 1957 , which was before the wall . There were three guys in the car . Karl , and this guy Mielke ? Erich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephan. who I had never seen before . They had sounded pretty tough and hard when they told me to get in the car , but when I got in , they sounded friendly , but sort of exacting . They gave me a cigar , though none of them smoked , I noticed , and asked me why I had n't met them . I told them security was too tight , and they said , " Well . we do n't want you to disappoint us again , and if you do we are going to pass the word to I lie Air Fiirce and see to it that you are appoliendecl for coming over here in Ilie first place , " We went back to the same safe house where they had taken me the first time , went hack to the same room . They shower me a lot of pictures of my wife 's relatives in East Germany- ? her grandmother and grandfather and her Aunt Greta , and a lot of young people I did n't even know . And they said , You want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they showed me a picture of me and Ushy in a bar , and they said . " How 'd you like your wife to know you are going around with this girl ? " They also had a lot of pictures of people in 0 . S.I. , including a couple of them making love in the back of a Volkswagen , and they asked me to identify these people and tell them all I knew about them , age , sex habits drinking habits , military status , where they lived , what languages they spoke . where they were born , what families they had , everything . I knew by now I was hooked . I was caught in the middle . So I told them all I knew . I cooperated with them . At first it was out of fear . Later on that changed . They did n't have to use fear anymore . They warmed up to me. and I warmed up to them . A few meetings later they gave me a little Minot camera and taught me how to use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cooperated with them 100 percent , and I actually got so I worked hard at it . I did n't feel fear anymore . I did n't feel ashamed . I just worked at it , like a job . Not for the money . for they never did give me much . Maybe for the excitement . Maybe the feeling I was getting even with some guys who had made it rough for me in the Air Force . I do n't know . I 've thought about it and thought about it . But I still do n't know why I acted as I did . Maybe a psychiatrist could understand it . Maybe somebody else can figure it out if I start at the beginning , which is January 30 , 1935 , when I was born in Detroit , Mich. , the first child of Robert and Bernice Thompson . My father was born in Canada . but in 1932-33 , somewhere along in there , he moved to this country and got naturalized and married my mother and a year after that . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , my mother had another baby , my sister Dorothy , who is married now and has children of her own . I guess my father had a pretty good job . He worked for a creamery , the Jersey Creamery , and he was in charge of their salesmen . About all I remember of my early years is that I was about as happy as any other kid , I guess . Then in 1941 , a year after Dorothy was born , my father got sick with rheumatic fever . He was sick in bed for two months , and then he died . That was on March 10 , 1941 . I remember it because on the morning of the day he died , I went in to say goodbye before 1 went to school , and he told me . " Son . you are going to have to look alter your mother and your lit tle sister . " While I was at school he died , and the next day I got the chicken j ) ox and did n't get to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , curly hair , blue eyes , always wore a suit , and he would take me with him sometimes when he went out to check up on the salesmen . Easygoing , did n't smoke or drink , and he had no vices at all I ever heard of . I got along very good with him . He walloped me just once . That was when I painted my little sister green . He had been painting the storm windows , and left the paint bucket out , and I got the brush and painted her , all over green . He gave me a hell of a licking for that . but I never held it against him . When he died , we had to move out of our house , and my mother and sister and I went to live with my grandmother and grandfather . I was very shook up psychologically by my father 's death . and it had a bad reaction on me . I was very nervous and jumpy , and I stuttered pretty badly . I had started to school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother had to take me in the car . But it was n't far . and by the time she got hack home , I was already back there . I realize now a lot of this was because I missed my father , but I was too young to know it then . My grandfather and grandmother were very strict people . but my grandfather was very good to me  --  treated me just like a son  --  and we got along very good . I got to be very close to him . He was a little guy . stood about live feet six . He was a master stonemason . I used to call him Pop . We stayed at my grandfather 's house - four years . Then my mother decided she wanted to be on her own again , - self-supporting . So in 1945 , when I was 10 years old . we moved to a place of our own , and she went to work as a saleswoman for a company that made cooking utensils . dinnerware , that sort - of stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when most of the demonstrations were held . And when she went out at night to work , I had to look after my little sister , who by now was about five years old . By this time I was doing very good in school . About two years after my father died , I started making all good marks , very good marks . and I kept this up until I went to high school . My stuttering was better too . I had some speech therapy in school that helped , but I still stuttered a little even after I was in the Air Force . After I finished grammar school . I went into an intermediate school and took a commercial course , shorthand and typing . I also took a machinist 's course , and an automotive mechanics course , which is what I 've always been interested in more than anything else . So when I went on into high school . I also got a job at night , as a coil splitter 's helper in a factory , making 51.20 an hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making 51.80 . I was underage to go to work legally . but I falsified my age . I knew a guy in the printing business and got him to print a phony draft card for me. showing I was born June 23 , 1932 , Then I took the NM ( card down to the motor vehicle bureau and got a di ti'er 's license with that age on it . I showed Iles to the company . and they lure ( in ? . At the same time I was going to high school . and I was n't mug so good . Between the job and school . I did n't gel much sleep . maybe live hours a night , and 1 did n't have time after school to do anything with the other kids . We got along all right , but 1 never got to go to dances , or school parties , or anything , because I had to work . I went to school by day and moonlighted on this job at night until the 11th grade . Then , in April . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my daddy had , and I was out sick  - -  out of school and out of work  --  until way up in the summer . And when fall came I did n't go back to school , but I did go back to work . I worked at the coil factory at night , and in the daytime I worked for a heating company . and on Saturdays and Sundays I pumped gas and worked as a mechanic in a filling station and garage . B y this time I was 17 , and I knew I was going to be drafted at 18 anyhow , so along about December . 1952 , I decided to enlist . My mother was against it . She said I was a boy of good morals , which was true . I had always been very attached to the church when I was younger . My father had been Episcopal . and my sister and I went to his church . It was St. Timothy 's Episcopal church , I sang in the boys ' choir , and was an acolyte , meaning I lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stnct values at that time about drinking and gambling , and girls . So when the service idea came up , my mother argued against it . but I told her , look . millions of guys have gone into the service , and it did n't do them any harm , and maybe I can learn a trade that will help me make a good living . Anyway , I 've got to go next year . so why not go now and get it over with ? So she finally signed the papers , which she had to , since I still was not quite 18 . But I remember her saying . when she signed the papers . the service was n't what it was cracked up to be . and I was going to be crazy disappointed . And she was right . I went down to the recruiting office in the Federal Building in Detroit and signed up for the Air Force . It was the ninth day of December , 1952 , and that night , along with 58 other guys from the Detroit area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . A sergeant met us . I remember , and he had a Jew choice words to say about us that ca n't be printed . I was assigned to a training flight , which is what they call a platoon in the Air Force , and drew my uniforms and started my basic airman 's training . Pretty soon I was made to realize I was n't an individual anymore . but just a number , and I got a little disgusted with the way the service was run . There were so many things you had to do that Were just a waste of time and energy , For instance , they 'd make you polish a garbage can until it was like glass , and then they 'd throw garbage in it . I ? litI n't 1.4,1 ) ( 1 ; loins ! this , though . lor I knew it was jiiNI a 1117711 0l 111111farY diScipline and limning . ( ) It 1 : ? th of klaich , some-whew along 111 ( .1 ( .. I graduated and gut my tripe as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out 1 ( 1Sheppard Air Force Base in Wichita Falls , Tex. , to an aircraft . and engine-mechanic school . I thought this was because my aptitude tests showed I was good at mechanics , but there was one fellow sent out with me had taught English literature at one of the universities in Virginia , and he had no more mechanical aptitude than the man in the moon . The only reason they sent us there was because they needed mechanics . I liked this school and had no problems at all . I graduated first in my class in the first and second phases of the training , and in the last phase I graduated third , They worked us hard . Sunday was the only day we had off . and on Sunday I 'd go to a movie , in town or on the base . with three or four other GI 's . But no drinking or anything like that . I graduated from there in August , and got a 15-day leave , which I spent at home in Detroit . Then I caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty at McClellan Air Force Base . They assigned me as a mechanic to the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron , a B-29 outfit . I enjoyed my life at McClellan . But then one day , when I was working on an engine , I fell off the crew-chief stand and banged up my back so bad / could hardly walk . For about a year , up into 1954 , I had to wear a big steel brace . They were going to discharge me on physical disability and give me a pension , which would come to about $28 a month . But I refused the discharge and went up before a board of doctors , and after they checked me over , they decided I could be retrained for another job . But instead of retraining me , they just reassigned me. making me a mail clerk in the same outfit I was in . I stayed in that job about a year and a half , and made corporal . T hen I got reassigned to Europe  --  rather to Camp Kilmer , N.J. , to await @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit about the 20th of December . And my mother , who had n't liked the idea of me going into the service , was now very proud and patriotic . So I had to get dressed in my uniform and go around and see a lot of relatives I had no interest in at all . I checked in at Kilmer on the second of January , and I was standing there in a whole roomful of GI 's , all of us clerks , waiting to get my shots before going overseas , when a sergeant came over and pulled me out of line and said , " The major wants to see you . " So I went in this little office , and the major says , " Thompson , you 've been in the Air Force longer than those other guys . How would you like to stay here instead of shipping out ? I 'll give you a real plush assignment . " I said , " Nab , I do n't want to stay here . I want to see the world . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major down . Looking hack on it , I guess that decision changed my whole life . even though I did n't know it then . If I 'd stayed there . everything would have turned out different . For when I left there . I had orders to the 7-193rd Special Investigation Wing at Rhein Main Air Force Base in Frankfort . Germany , and then from Frankfort I went to the 0.5.1. unit in Berlin . and that 's where all my troubles started . But hell , there 's no way a man can figure these things . If I had n't studied typing in school 1 never would have been a clerk . If I had n't fell oh that workstand on my tail I would still have been a mechanic instead of a clerk . And if I had been a mechanic I never would have been in O.S.I. So you ca n't tell what 's going to work out good . or bad . Anyway , when I turned down that major at Kilmer  --  that one instance changed my life . The 7493rd Special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force . Its jurisdiction spreads all the way from Europe to the Middle East and up to Norway . Sweden and Denmark . Its job is to support local Air Force commanders in their investigations of crimes involving Air Force personnel , or civilian employees of the Air Force , and it is also a counterintelligence unit . The day I reported at Rhein Main the colonel called me in and asked me if I 'd like to be assigned to Berlin . I told him it did n't ro any difference to me where I was . red . I had my three years to do ithd one place was just like another to me . He said well , he would like for me to go up to Berlin . for there was an officer up there he was having trouble with . This officer , he said , was having sexual relationships with a German female , who was a Soviet agent , a spy . It shook me up that he should tell me this . Here I was , just an airman. and here was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer . I could n't see what the hell he expected me to do about it . As it turned out , I did n't do anything , for the officer he was talking about left for the States about the same time I reported in . That night I left for Berlin . An airman first class met me at the station and drove me out to Tempelhof Air Base , where the unit I 'd be working with was stationed . ft was a small outfit , 26 officers and five enlisted men . This airman took me to my room in the big building , So 1 put my gear down and he took me down to the central file room to show me around . A II I did that first day was type out names and addresses on three-bylive index cards and file them . I did n't know what this was all about , but I found out later . Anyway . the second day , the C.U . of the unit , Colonel Carlson , called me in and told me I was assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and to report to him personally anything suspicious about anybody who works in this office . I said suspicious like what , and he said " anything involving security . " Then he told me about some homosexual allegations that had been made against some Air Force personnel , and though a couple of them had left , one of them was still there . So I began tounderstand what kind of outfit I was in , where everybody was spying on everybody else . I was n't 1151 happy about being mixed tip in Iles kind of deal . I never had any experienc ? in investigative work , and this staff about hi MTV isexuals , and the offiet.r oho was supposed hi be sleeping with he spy . shook nit , up a little . It shook me up worse than I his when I was told , " Boy . you are expendable . TN , Russians got this town ringed with troops and tanks . They could overrun this place in five minutes . " Matter of fact , the office was set up as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live minutes . All the O.S.I. personnel files were left hack in Washington , D.C. If you wanted to know how much leave time you had coming , you had to keep it in your head , or send a message hack to headquarters . On all the files we kept there , each cabinet had a five-gallon jerry can of gasoline on it , plus an incendiary grenade , so we could burn the place down in a hurry if the Soviets came in . Pretty soon I found out what these index cards I was filing was all about , and that seemed to me like a dirty business too . What happened was this , All the mail that came into Berlin from the States , whether it was military or civilian , was sent here , where it was opened and photographed . They 'd slip a steam pencil under the flap of the envelope and steam it open and photograph the letter , and then they 'd seal it back , and without a microscope you could n't tell it had been opened . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German civilians doing the photography . There were only two Americans there . One was an Army major and the other a civilian . They would examine the photographs of the letters and decide which was of Air Force interest . and which Army interest . and which should he referred to the CIA . Then the Air Force names were put on these index cards , and the letter was filed . That 's what I was doing . ? Ve had about 68.000 of these cards in our files . Later on , when I learned to read German , I read some of these letters . and some of them were kind of interesting . There was one officer . back in the States , a very high officer , who used to write to an old German girl friend he 'd known way back in the ' 30 's . He wrote pretty good letters . Nobody 's letter was immune- congressmen , senators , anybody . I remember one letter from this guy Mike Mansfield of Montana . Not from him , but from his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives or something in Montana . Perfectly innocent , but it was on file . About a week after I got there they put me in charge of the file room . The guy who had been in charge was married to a German girl . and I think they were a little leery of him on account of that . Anyway , he was transferred to another job  --  somewhere in West Germany . I heard . About this time I found out that some of the names on the cards came from telejihiine tapes . ' this outfit called Commumcat I ( in Intercept . that opened all the mail , also had charge of tapping the telephones and tape-recording the conversations . Everybody in any responsible position at all had a tap On his phone , all the West German politicians , all the troop commanders . anyhody involved in security matters in any way , his telephone was Lapped . had to read the verbatim transcription they made from the tapes to see if there was any security matters involved . Everybody was being watched all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month you 'd make a verbal report to the colonel . dui if something spectacular happened if a guy was starting to spend money like it was going out of style . or starting to go around the bars with a new girl friend - you 'd report anything like that immediately . ' had to watch all the 0.5 . I. person-nel , and a couple of times I was asked to put a particular lookout on some guy , like maybe a GI who had been born in Germany . And I know that a couple of guys had been assigned to watch me. though we never talked about it . You just knew sometxxly was keeping an eye on every move you made . For instance , a guy would get called in and they 'd say , " Where 'd you get that dough you 've been flashing around ?

Then they 'd suspect she was a spy . sent to buy you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side , of course . We 'd send girls over to try to seduce some key guy . like a big-shot 's chauffeur , so we could blackmail him . or we used narcotics . We had a woman in East Berlin who ran a house of ill repute patronized by the Russian soldiers . Now . I thought all this was wrong When I was a postal clerk , I would n't even read somebody else 's postcards . The whole operation was a strain on everybody connected with it . and if you will look at the number of officers we had who broke under it , and got in some sort of trouble , you 'll see what I mean . It was an emotional strain . The way it showed up on me . I wanted to get off by myself . I 'd work from eight to live . five days . sometimes six days a week . and then at night I 'd go out and walk all over the city . That 's how I got to know it so well . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till I came to Berlin . Once or twice back in the States . maybe . I 'd go out and get bombed like any young soldier . But nothing serious . Then one night , when I was walking around , I passed a small bar and I saw some Americans in there . They were Army guys . and I got to talking with them , and I had a few beers , and a feu more . and a few more , and then I had a couple of cognacs . The next morning I woke up in a hotel somewhere .

So I got to the base all right . but I was in terrale shape . real hung over . For a while after that I slowed clown on my drinking . But I did keep taking those long walks , just wandering around , A couple of months later , there was some sort of American holiday , Air Force Day or something , and 1 went out for a long walk and got lost . I knew I was close to the border , but I did n't know exactly where . and one thing sure . I did n't want to cross by mistake , and get picked up . So I saw this sign ERNST HULLER , PLUMBING . over a shop , and I looked in the door and there was a tall girl in there . Big , clean-looking , tall girl , red-haired. nicely dressed . I went in and asked her , in German . how to get back to Tempelhof Air Base , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of brown corduroy pants . old sports jacket and a trench coat that had seen a lot of wear .

I see a name . I can remember where I saw it before . and I remembered this was the plumbing shop where this girl worked . So I said to myself , I 'm gon na call up and ask her for a date . She answered the phone , and I told her I was the guy who was lost and asking for directions . She must have thought I was a nut or something . for she would n't make a date . But I called her again the next day , and this time she agreed to meet me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between me and Evelyn . One thing led to the next , and three months later decided we would get married . They do n't encourage you to marry a German if you are in O.S.I. They want everything to be 100 percent American , so there was a whole lot of red tape to it , and it was nine months before the papers came through . When I knew I was going to get married , I had reenlisted and asked for a transfer to an outfit down in Italy , I hated the all the **26;2449;TOOLONG stuff . and I figured that in another outfit we could get married without all the delay . But they accepted my re-enlistment , and three days later turned down my request for transfer . Evelyn turned 18 on the ninth of February . 1956. and we got married on the 10th in the Berlin City Hall . Then we got married again at the American consulate , and then we were married again in the church .

The celebration lasted throe days , Much is the German tradition . My best man was a German Mk nv named Hans I went around with a lot . I had picked up the language fast , and by the time I got married I could just al-out pass as a German . 1 used to associate with Germans a lot more than I did with GI 's , just to get away from Big Brother . This guy was a nice guy , worked in a brewery as a keg maker and played soccer . The maid of honor was his girl friend , a girl my wife knew . We got off to a pretty good start in our married life . Had a baby , Patricia Ann . born the 30th of October . and for a while I was happy  --  not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apartment on Kaiserwerther Strassethe second house down from where the Four Powers had their headquarters . It was a nice apartment on the fifth floor  --  the top floor  --  and we had a balcony , a living room . a dining room , bedroom , and kitchen . All furnished with old-style German furniture , but nice . A ter we moved to another top-floor apartment on the corner of Gartenstrasse and Linter den Eichen . It was the most tastefully furnished place my wife and I have had since we married , and we furnished it all ourselves . We bought the furniture out of a mail-order catalog and from the PX , and some of the furniture we built ourselves . It was really nice . I slowed down on my drinking for a while after we got married . Then the job got to bugging me . We had a new colonel , Colonel Davidson . and it looked like I could n't do anything right for him . I will say , though , the colonel was nice to me once . He invited me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathouse . He had a Siamese cat and a Manx cat and he had a draftsman draw up the plans . A split-level cathouse . Lights , running water , heat  --  everything . Mostly . though . he really bugged me . Like when I got this telegram that my grandfather back in Detroit was dying in the hospital , and I applied for an emergency leave to go back there , Colonel Davidson told me I was too valuable a man , and they could n't spare me even long enough to go back to my grandfather 's funeral . I said , " Hell . I know how valuable I am . I never get promoted or anything I 'm so valuable . " And so Davidson got in a huff and a puff about it . and I did n't get leave to go back , and that hurt me , for losing my grandfather was like losing a father for the second time . I was disgusted with my life in the service . I was disgusted with the Air Force  --  disgusted with what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kids would come over from East Germany and apply for political asylum  --  nice young fellows , young boys . 19 , 20 , 22 years old . crossing over because they did n't want to get drafted into the East German Army . But we 'd tell them no , you go back , go in the army , and we 'll pay you 400 marks a month to spy for us . I seen so many of these guys fall for this . They 'd go hack. and the next thing they were caught and shot . or had a life sentence . These things got to me , and sometimes I 'd come home and tell my wife I could n't stand another day of it . When I started drinking heavy . Evelyn and I started quarreling I 'd go out sometimes and come in intoxicated , and she would get sore , and I 'd get up feeling lousy and raise hell about the coffee did n't taste right , or the eggs did n't look right , and she 'd get out and walk home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave me. except maybe just for the day . Things got worse at the office . They assigned me to jobs I was n't supposed to do . Jobs that were not in the job description of a clerk who is an administrative man . Naturally I could do nothing about it though , for you 've got no union to protect you when you are in the service . One of the jobs they assigned me to was duty agent . which is like a guard . You are on duty hours a day , and you take all the incoming intelligence calls , decide what to do , and maybe you have to go out and arrest somebody . Only an accredited O.S.I. agent with credentials , not a file clerk . was supposed to do this job . But Colonel Davidson assigned this job to me one Sunday anyway . That Sunday is when my trouble started . I was on duty . and this airman came by who was a stool pigeon reporting to Colonel Davidson . He was re sponsible for several guys getting broke in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me . " Look . let 's go down to the Silver Wings Club and have lunch . " I could do this because this was the noncommissioned officers ' club right there on the base , right beneath our office . So him and me went down there and bad a couple of drinks , a couple more , a couple more . To be honest , I could n't tell how many . We went back to the office , and this guy brought along a bottle of cognac , and we drank that , and then we were really drunk . So we left there in my car and went into Berlin to a bar called the Rancho Bar . a place much favored by American servicemen , with a little dance floor and a small combo playing lots of Spanish music . It was hot in there , so I took off my jacket and hung it up . and later when I got back to base I found out the .38 Smith &; Wesson Chief 's Special revolver I had in the pocket was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys from the security detachment . a radio-monitoring service at the base . was in the bar , and they had stole it . I figured it was gone for good , so I went to the supply room and took a .38 out of supply , thinking I could buy one on the black market and replace it . T he next morning my gun showed up . The two guys from security had turned it in . So Colonel Davidson asked me . " How is it you 've got two .38 's ? " and I told him . He said , " Well , I 'm going to hang you . I 'm going to court-martial you . " Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice he could n't court-martial me himself , so this captain flew up from Wiesbaden and court-martialed me . It took just five minutes . I pleaded guilty . which I should n't have done . I should have fought it . I should have said , " Let 's go to court , 1 did n't steal this gun to steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I was green . They took one stripe off my sleeve and fined me two thirds of my pay for a month . But this was n't all my punishment . The day after I pleaded guilty , Davidson called me in and said , " Thompson , I 'm not through with you yet . I want your wife sent to the States , and want you to live back on this base . " My wife was really shook up . We were just getting settled down , establishing a homelife , had a little baby . We were getting together a few things like a married family should . And we had to sell them all , for I was n't authorized to ship them . It was rough , I tell you . Just married a year . and then you have to part . The worst thing about it was my wifecould n't understand what was happening . She thought I was doing this just to get rid of her . So , a year and a day after we were married , she and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother 's house in Detroit . and I moved hack onto the base . I was really teed off . I do n't mindtelling you . I was really disgusted with the American Air Force . The colonel was constantly on me about little details . This , and my wife being gone , made me very irritable , and I got in serious arguments with the other 0.5.1. guys over very unimportant things . For instance , I was sharing a room with a guy , and he ate an orange and left the peeling in an ashtray . I got so mad at him , I picked him up and shook him , which was not my normal attitude . I 'm not a guy to fight ? I 'd run before I 'd fight , probably . But I was about cracked up . I was walking right along the razor 's edge . I even thought about committing suicide . I went Out and bought a little 25-caliber German automatic . But drunk or sober I did n't have the guts to pull the trigger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that 's where I kept seeing this kid Ursula . " Ushy " we called her , because there was a comic-strip character by that name . She was a good-looking brunet kid . dark hair , green eyes  --  emerald-colored . Not stacked , but a good build , wore a pony tail , black toreador pants . She was a cute little trick . Looked like Connie Stevens on Hawaiian Eye . except for the brown hair . But sort of a nut . We 'd have a drink in the bars . andtalk , and then eventually we started going around to her room on Obentrautstrasse. but there 's no use saying anymore about that . It happened so many times I could n't count them . The reason I bring up this girl Ushy is she figured in what happened next . It was on a Saturday morning in June of ' 57 . It was my day off , but I had gone back to the office to catch up on some filing . Because we were authorized three file clerks but had only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my office working like hell . and I had my uniform on , but I had taken my tie off because I wanted to be comfortable . And I had n't taken time to shave that morning . I was sitting there , typing these index cards , when I looked up and the colonel was standing there . He was a big guy . heavy-set. tall , about 230 pounds , white hair , what was left of it , and a white moustache . He began bawling me out , raising hell about me having no tie on and needing a shave . This made me so damn mad I said . " I did n't even have to be here today in the first place . This is my day off . " And he said . " You do n't have any days off  --  you are on duty twenty-four hours a day . Anyhow , you 're here , and you are going to have to be neat . " Then he shoved off . The way he said it just went right through me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12:30 I left and %wilt down to the Nlanhattan Bar . Ushy was there . and I had a lot of drinks cognacs rod-sized ones too . believe me . And I told her about my nun-in with the colonel , and I guess I got it all off my , chest -- about that office and how 1 could n't stand to work there anymore . I do n't remember exactly what was said , for I got pretty drunk pretty quick . But 1 do know I wanted to be completely clear of the Air Force . That was the day I broke , went to pieces . that Saturday between the hours of maybe 12 noon and 5. 5:30 in the afternoon . Now I do n't want to condemn this woman- -I do n't remember enough to know whether she put it in MY mind psychologically to cross over or not . I just feel that when I got it all off my chest , she said something like , " Well , why do n't you do something about it ? " Anyway , when I left her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind to go to East Berlin . I walked along Mariendorfer Dam , over across Friedrichstrasse , which goes into East Berlin . all the way to Stalinallee . There was no wall or guard there , and I just walked over , and I walked along until I came to a telephone booth on the street . I called 555-361. the number of the Berlin secret police , which we had in our tiles at the office . I asked for the duty officer , an , .1 the girl at the switchboard fussed around a while and finally the duty officer came on . I told him I was an Allied soldier and wanted to talk to him . He told me to wait , he 'd be right over . It was getting along toward six o'clock , but still light , and I walked around in that area . looking at the shops , about 45 minutes . I was across the street when a car pulled up at the phone booth . I saw in the back window a little medicine chest with a red cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secret-police car , for this medicine chest is actually a tape recorder . So I walked over , and there was a chunky , blond , curly-headed guy in civilian clothes in the car , and I said , " Who are you ? " and he said , " I 'm the duty officer , " and showed me his credentials . So I got in the car and told him who I was and where I was from . He was all shook up and drove around the corner , past this bombed-out ruin , to a bar , and went in and used the telephone . Then we left there and went to a little house in the Baumschulenweg district , a suburb . And this guy came out who introduced himself as Karl Emrich , a little blue-eyed guy with thin brown hair , a snappy dresser , spoke good English . He got in the car and handed me a pair of dark glasses to hide my face a little , and we drove from there by a hell of a roundabout Way . to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work for them . I met with them lots of times after that . I 'd take a certain train to get there at a certain time . l'cl take the S-Bahn  --  an elevated train like the Chicago El . I 'd get off at the station near the Russian War Memorial and walk a couple ot hiwits , so they could surveil me to we if 1 was bring followed , and they 'd pick me up and take inc to a safe house . Not the saint ' 1411 ' every time . A lot of different ones . Like I said before , pretty si on I began to warm up to them , and they began to warm tip to me . They began to give me a little money 50 marks , about $12.50 U.S. About the fourth time I went over , they gave me this little Minox camera and told me they wanted me to photograph all the documents that came across my desk . For about an hour and a half they showed me how to use it . Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  - -  which was my cover name ? " receive one H-Minox camera from agents , and two rolls of film . " and I signed it . I put the camera in my tobacco pouch . and slipped the two rolls of film down inside the lining of my jacket at the shoulder , one in the front , one in the back , so they would n't clink together . That way , if they frisk you , you just hold your jacket out and they do n't feel the film . I was alone in the file office a lot , so it was no problem to photograph documents . But the first time 1 did , my hands shook so bad 1 was worried the pictures would n't even come out . I was so afraid . I was sweating . I had the door locked , and the key on the inside so nobody could put a key in from outside . But I was afraid somebody might knock . I was afraid they had the office hugged , and the mike would pick up the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth to cock the shutter and advance the film . But I finally finished two rolls of film . The first papers I photographed were the Berlin daily police reports . and lists of people on the " waybills " ? people flying out of Berlin . I took the two rolls  --  a hundred pictures  --  across that night , and as soon as I got off the train . a guy grabbed the film and took off in a black automobile , with two motorcycles as escort . They took me to the safe house , and in about two hours one of the motorcycles came back , and a guy said the films had been processed and they were OK . They did n't just want pictures . they wanted information also . They wanted details on all the safe houses on our side . They 'd show me a picture of a house , or give me an address . and I 'd go by and look . Then I 'd tell them which organization it belonged to  --  Army Intelligence , CIA , 0 . S.I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of all the O.S.I. safe houses and their addresses . so I photographed this and took it over . All the time I was doing this , I was fairly happy with the arrangement . I was n't doing it for money . 1 was doing it just for my own personal satisfaction , getting back at the people who had given me so much hell . The office job was still as lousy as it had been , but I did n't let it worry me anymore . 1 guess I felt like  --  well , somebody is recognizing my talents , even if you do n't . I think , maybe . in a weird sense , I felt like a hero or something . I did n't have any regrets . And even if 1 had thought about quitting and giving myself up , something that happened about that time would have made me change my mind . An American staff sergeant who had defected to East Germany came back , and I was one of the men who arrested him . He got six years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest a guy , and I tell you , it gave me a queer feeling . I was shook up . Here I was a spy for the Russians , arresting another guy for being a spy . This staff sergeant I helped arrest had been in that same room . the one with the sun porch , where I had been . He told us about it , and I had a hell of a time to keep from saying , " Yeah , yeah , " when he was describing it . Not long after I got the camera the Soviets gave me this special pair of shoes , oxblood , slip-on type , Italian cut , very good quality shoes . They also gave me a tiny screwdriver , about three quarters of an inch long . If I slipped it in a nail hole in the back of the heel of the left shoe and gave it a quarter turn , a lock mechanism inside released , and the heel came off . It was hollowed out so that two rolls of Nlinox film fitted in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had a place for capsules , and they gave me two capsules . They were to commit suicide with , in case I got caught . They told me the poison in them brought on a reaction similar to a heart seizure , and it could not be detected in an autopsy unless you knew what to look for . 0 ne time the shoes nearly caused me to have a heart attack without taking any poison . I was working in the office , and 1 had two rolls of film in my shoe , because I was going over that night . This guy in charge of our counterintelligence came in and said something to me . I turned quickly and the shoe heel popped off . My heart beat so bad I thought it was jumping out of my jacket . I stuttered something about " This damn shoe , " and leaned over and clicked it back on . I guess a typewriter was in his line of sight . or something . Anyway . he did n't notice . Right after they gave me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the wall . These were actually microphones , radio transmitters , but they would also function as a normal light plug . They were easy to put in  --  just unfasten a couple of screws , take out the old plug and put in the transmitter . I installed all of them on a Saturday when I was duty agent  --  one in the central file room , where I worked , another in the C.O. 's office . another in the office of the chief of the Counterintelligence Section of 0.5 . I .. and the fourth one in the Informant Control Office , where they made up the pay sheets for the informers who came over , evaluating what their information is worth-4,000 marks . 2,000 marks , Whatever . We had a system for checking whether the plug was working or not . If it was , they could hear me , screwing the plate back on , whistling , muttering to myself . Then I 'd go downstairs to the Silver Wings Club , and call this certain number , and when the guy answered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop ? " And if the guy said " fa , " I 'd know the plug was working . So I 'd ask some innocent question about the price of roses or something and hang up . If he said . " Nein , you got the wrong number , " I 'd know it was n't working . Then I 'd try it again and , a little later . if it was working , I 'd hear two honks on an auto horn outside , and this would confirm it . The first three I put in worked fine . But the one I put in the office of the Chief of Informant Control did n't work . We tried and tried . Finally , I found out why . Hitler had used this building to store X rays and films and the entire wall was shielded with lead . Not long after that they told me not to come back over until I got a particular signal . I was to look for a roofing nail stuck in a certain wooden telephone pole on the Obentrautstrasse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and meet them at a safe house on the following night . I went by there two or three times on my way to Ushy 's house , and finally I seen the nail . I needed to go over , for I had some news for them . My orders had come in , transferring me back to the States , to Malmstrom Air Force Base at Great Falls , Mont . The Soviets got alarmed when I told them this , for they thought I had been compromised or something . But I told them . " Nah , it 's just my normal time to rotate . I 've been here three years . " This calmed them down , and they asked me did I want to go back to the States , or did I want to go and live in Russia . I told them I wanted to go back . So they said OK . But if you do go back , you got to keep on working for us . Then they started to talk about how much money I 'd need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so on . And they asked me if I could take five or 10 days ' leave before I went back . They wanted to take me to the Soviet Union and teach me a few techniques I 'd need to know , so I could send them information from the States . So I put in for leave , signing out to go to West Germany . The leave came through OK , and on a cold night in December I crossed over to the East . Dressed in civilian clothes as always , I went to the phone booth in Stalinallee and dialed a number , and when the duty officer answered , I said . " Here is Gregor . please . Peace . " I was on my way to Russia .
