The nationwide drive to get Americans of all ages vaccinated against polio was snarled last week in a furious controversy over the safety of the Sabin oral vaccine , Type III . Among 1962 's relatively few cases of paralytic poliomyelitis ( fewer than 450 to date , with the total not expected to exceed 700 for the year ) was a handful believed to have been caused by the Sabin vaccine itself . An expert advisory committee called in by the U.S. Public Health Service recommended continuing all Sabin vaccination programs for children , and also ruled Types I and II safe for adults , but left it up to state and local health authorities to decide whether to go on giving Type III to adults . <P> The weakened strain of Type III poliovirus developed by the University of Cincinnati 's Dr. Albert B. Sabin had always been accused by some virologists of occasionally reverting to a dangerous form after multiplying in human vaccinees. and the PHS had delayed its approval for many months until last March . Since then , an estimated 13 million Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOS " ( Sabin Oral Sunday ) campaigns such as the one held in Cleveland last June ( TIME , July 6 ) . Up to 5,000,000 of those who took Type III were adults . <P> At first , no ill effects were reported . But then a cluster of three paralytic cases developed in Oregon within seven to 30 days after vaccination . Nebraska soon had three cases , Michigan and Ohio had two each , and New York had one . Two of these eleven victims were in their teens , but the others were aged 23 to 52 . The available evidence , including complex laboratory tests , indicated that in four cases the disease was caused by the vaccine . About the others , the PHS experts withheld judgment . <P> Because the PHS was so inconclusive , several U.S. cities canceled or postponed their Type III programs , while others , notably Houston , decided to go full steam ahead . Though no medical authority would put it in such down-to-earth terms , the best advice available was to play the odds . An unvaccinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III polio . If all eleven paralytic cases now under suspicion were traced to the vaccine , the takers ' risk would be about one 500,000-and the risk of vaccination would not be justified . Among preschool and school-age children , the risk of getting polio from Type III virus in its natural state is much greater , and the risk of getting it from the vaccine is almost nonexistent . Delay in Type III Sabin vaccinations , until the experts finish their lab studies , is therefore justified for adults , but not for children .
