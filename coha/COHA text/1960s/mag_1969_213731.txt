Ever since Boston 's new $21.6 million City Hall was designed in 1962 , it has been the focus of controversy . Most architecture critics consider it one of the great buildings of the 1960s , a richly textured , concrete-and-brick structure that reflects the influence of the late architect Le Corbusier and , in its emphatic use of raw concrete , of the contemporary English " Brutalists " as well . But to most citizens , it looked too for-tresslike for comfort . <P> Dedicated last week , the new City Hall draws 5,000 Bostonians every day to register to vote , pay taxes , buy licenses and be assigned to jury duty . Those who expected to find the building 's interior gloomy and intimidating have been surprised by its airy openness . It is bathed in natural light , which pours down a central courtyard and through wide light shafts rising the full height of the nine-story building . It is extraordinarily accessible , with a subway station nearby and even has a concourse running through its ground floor . " It is the nexus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Architect Noel McKinnell , whose firm , Kallmann , Mc-Kinnell &; Knowles , won the competition to design the building as the centerpiece of Boston 's 60-acre Government Center . <P> Once inside , the visitors see soaring public spaces as stunning and vast as any Piranesi conceived in his 18th century etchings . Two tremendous lobbies serve as civic areas capable of holding crowds of sit-ins or celebrators . A magnificent ceremonial flight of stairs leads , like a cascade of red Boston brick , from one lobby up to a huge city council chamber and the mayor 's offices . <P> " The major areas of City Hall 's interior were designed to lend dignity to the interaction between people and government , " says McKinnell . " We felt that we had a bigger client to satisfy than just municipal department heads-the citizenry . Otherwise you have 1984 , with a faceless bureaucracy running your affairs for you . " Whether the citizenry has come to appreciate it or not , Boston City Hall , inside and out , can hardly be accused of being faceless. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
