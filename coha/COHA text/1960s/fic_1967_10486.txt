He carefully poured out two glasses and salutedGeraldine . " Rehabilitation . " He drank the wine , stood up suddenly and lurched toward the back counter with a hand at his stomach . The proprietor watched him with bored distaste . " Through the door there , " the man said . " Watch out for them hamburger rolls . " Rheinhardt went through the rear door and into a faceful of sunlight . The back of his head throbbing , he leaned against a shingled wall and caught his breath .

" I realize that . " She took a cigarette from her bag , lit it , then flicked it despairinglyinto the street , frowning . " Aw what the hell , " she said . " C'm on up . " They went through a narrow doorway and up a flight of stairs . On the wall at the first landing was the glass-enclosed picture of a giant hand with button cuffs that seemed to be pointing out an open window . " I. Garulik , " a sign said under the picture said . " Invisible Reweaver . She turned on him suddenly with an angry look . " I can run you out with a cup of coffee , you know . Do n't let me see you lookin ' all pleased with yourself .

" I 'll play with ye . Give me one for him , too . This is his lucky day. " 6o cents , " the girl with braces said . She took the change and handed over two green slips with red numbers printed on them . " Thank you a lot , Geraldine . You get closer to hittin ' it ever ' day . " " Sure , " Geraldine said . It was the first room on the left , there was a double bed with a frayed cloth canopy over it , a double burner on a telephonep102stand . A full set of French windows with several panes missing were opened into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sunny street . Geraldine bolted the door behind them and started making coffee on the burner . Rheinhardt went over and lay down on the bed . From the hallway , they could hear the measured beat of the girl 's braced legs as she climbed down the stairs . " I play ' em all the time , " Geraldine said . " To help her out mainly . She do n't make no money sellin ' those newspapers . " She brought out two cups from a medicine cabinet over the sink and set them on a dresser . " Well you got in , did n't you ? What the hell 's your name any-way ? " He was lying across the pillow , his head hanging to one side , his eyes closed . Geraldine walked over and stood beside him . " Hey , " she said . " Well I 'll be goddamned .

Geraldine set the cup down , hauled off and punched him as hard as she could on the shoulder . He grunted , and managed to turn over on his stomach . " Well , I 'll be goddamned , " Geraldine said . With the Sunday morning sun in his face , Rheinhardt walked along Canal Street , hunching his shoulders now and then to air the armpits of his suit jacket . It was eight o'clock . In mid-street , the traffic islands were empty and simmering , brown wasted palm fronds hung dead-still over the gleaming trolley rails . Atop the Cotton Exchange buildings , carillons began " A Mighty FortressIs Our God " ; in the deep shade of the downtown side a party of negro churchwomen walked sanctified under black umbrellas . At the corner of Burgundy Street , he followed humming traf/fic signals across the deserted street and stood for a while before the unlit display windows of Torneille 's Department Store . The glass front doors were locked when he tried them . Walking slowly he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniformed guard at the far end of the block , who was standing just out of the sun reading the morning 's funny papers . Above the guard , mounted on the metal railing of a fire escape was a large sign showing a white eagle rampant over a starred and striped shield and a microphone from which radiated variously red , white and blue thunderbolts . Printed beneath it in white capital letters was : WUSA  --  The Voice of an American 's America  --  The Truth Shall Make You FreeRheinhardt showed his appointment slip and followed the guard to a small hot room off the service entrance that was hung with canvas fenders and time clock machines . On the service elevator button which the guard pressed , was another placard with the WUSA call letters and a small black arrow pointing upward . The elevator came , operated by a large dark man in a neat blue business suit  --  the rented guard went out to finish the comics , and Rheinhardt rode to the top floor between stacked wooden crates and coils of electrical wire . Rheinhardt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workmen and equipment . There was a litter of excelsior on the floor ; at the rear where a row of splintering inventory shelves were still standing , they had taken out a section of wall to show a labyrinth of colored wire . He walked across the hall and on to a raised platform leading to the next room . A group of men in shirtsleeves were drinking coffee on the far side of a newly taped-in glass pane ; Rheinhardt found a door and went in  --  from nearby he heard the clatter of wire service tickers . He nodded amiably to the coffee drinkers and stopped a blond girl in a seersucker suit who was speeding by with a wicker basket of stationery . " Mr. Noonan , " Rheinhardt asked her , " where is he ? "  |p104The  girl flipped a limp tanned wrist toward another door and smiled at him . " God knows . " One of the men in shirtsleeves set his cup down and came over . " Looking for Noonan ? " " Right . " Rheinhardt said . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Wha ? " someone said . " A man . " Jack Noonan came out holding a yellow sheaf of wire copy . He was a fairly young man who bore , with some self-consciousness , the traces of theatrical good looks . His temples were grayingimpressively ; his features were clean lined , a trifle drawn . He had rather dull and vaguely malevolent blue eyes . He glanced at Rheinhardt , handed the page of copy to the shirt-sleeved man with a cool imperious gesture and smiled comfortably . " Hi , " he said . " Hi , " Rheinhardt said . " I heard something the other day about you boys filling out a staff . " " Yah , " Jack Noonan said . " Right . Definitely . " " I thought I could help you with that . " " Are you an announcer ? " " I usually work in a musical format , " Rheinhardt said . " I mean I have been . But I can work up news breaks too  --  I can work from wire copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitches over if they need it . " Jack Noonan nodded tolerantly , still smiling . " You sound like a pretty powerful package . " " I worked a lot of small stations . You get to keep your hand in . " Uh huh , " Noonan said . " This is n't a small station . " " No , " Rheinhardt said . " Where did you work last ? " " DCKO . In Orangeburg . " " Orangeburg where ? "  | " South Carolina . " Jack Noonan fixed his dull smile on the points of Rheinhardt 's freshly shined Italian shoes . " That must be small , " he said. " 50o kilowatts . About 500 . " " Uh huh . " Looking suddenly disinterested , Noonan took the wire copy back from the man who had been holding it and exchanged a smile with him . " Waal , goodbuddy , " he told Rheinhardt humorously , " unlike your average station , see , WUSA is a well planned out business operation . Most of the time a station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , or who it wants to do what . But here , see , we know pretty much exactly . " " You mean it is n't amateur night . " Rheinhardt said . " No , " Jack Noonan said , " it is n't amateur night . " He took a handkerchief from the breast pocket of his jacket and ran it over the film of sweat across his high forehead . " But  --  as it stands right now we have the deal of a lifetime for the right personnel . As it stands right now just about anyone can walk off the street and show us what he can do . And we 'll watch him awhile , see , but we ca n't exactly give him all our time and sympathetic un-derstanding . " " What would you like to see ? " Rheinhardt said . " I think I 'd like to see if you 're really such a heavy caliber utilityman . For example I 'd like to see you hit those tickers back there and take off enough for a real swinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn people on to what 's happening . And then I 'd like to hear you tape and deliver it . " " OK , " Rheinhardt said . " Crazy " Jack Noonan said . " The ticks are right through that door . I 'll give you twenty minutes to make up five minutes worth and if you make it I 'll get you an engineer . " " - W'ho listens to it ? " " Me . " Jack Noonan said . " I do . "  | " Are you the hiring man ? " " Well , " Noonan said , smiling , " if you really skull me , see , then I 'll run it up to Mr. Bingamon . " Rheinhardt started through the door to the teletype room . " Good luck , " Jack Noonan said . " You know , " Rheinhardt said , looking back at him , " it 's funny . . . I mean when you say five minutes of news to turn the people on with . I do n't think I ever hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Noonan said . " There is n't much . But , see , here there is . " " You must expect people to listen to it . " " Oh , we do , " Noonan said cheerfully . " It 's something new with us . " Rheinhardt went on into the soundproofed cacophony of the ticker room ; through a large glass window at the left wall he could see down to the elevator lobby where the pushing and totingwas still going on . There were seven tickers in the room , all of them running  --  stopping and starting in fits , a steady clackingcounterpoint measured with the periodic urgent ring of the line bell . Beside the window were a desk and chair with a glue pot , a sharpened blue pencil and a pair of scissors . Rheinhardt hung his jacket across the back of the chair and went over to the row of spikes above the machines . He took four or five items from the international wire and worked them over briefly  --  there were no specials , it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things and Johnson had something more or less unintelligible . Someone had shot at De Gaulle 's chauffeur . A Boeing 747 had blown up and fallen into the Quadalaquivir . In Indo-China the defense of civilization was proceeding . Setting the international to one side , he took down a few strips from the statewide wire ; this would be where the meat was hung . It consisted mainly of local bits assembled by the city service office , the State House wire from Baton Rouge and whateverp107gleanings the service 's editor in the rest of the country thought would be useful to Southern subscribers . Most of them were race items in one sense of another . He went down the line with the pencil in his hand , drawing small blue F clefs in the right margin . What kind of a day has it been in the heartland ? In open weekend session the Legislature 's Un-American ActivitiesCommittee approved a motion introduced by a young corner , twenty-one-year-old Representative Jimmy " Dimples " Snipe of Hotchkiss . Representative Snipe 's motion called for the issuance of a subpoena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Touro Collection of Contemporary Art . " Dimples " told his colleagues how he and his bride , on a culturalvisit to the city , had stopped by the collection and found it the work of obscene madmen from beginning to end . This collection , he had learned , was state supported ; the honest yeomanry of the state were bled dry to pander the diseased taste of a volatileand subversive city rabble . His suspicions aroused , " Dimples " had unearthed Lictheim as the man in charge ; delving furtherhe had examined the man 's application papers and found them a tissue of lies . For example , Morris Lictheim had entered his country of origin as Austria , when documented research proved that the city and province of his birth had been an integral part of Poland since 1918 , the year following the Bolshevik rising . Supporting his motion with colored slides of the exhibit taken by his wife , Representative Snipe reminded a hushed and sober chamber that Poland was a Communist slave nation , borderingextensively on Russia itself . They would see about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an overturned Pontiacan U.S. Highway 90 : a little farther down the road three strawberry pickers fell out of a contractor 's speeding truck  --  one dead . At a ceremony , during which he presented a trophy to the winnerof the Emoryville Stock Car Tournament , Judge Horace St.p108Saens of Bracque Parish , a candidate for governor , explained that his reference to Negroes as burrhead gorillas and nun-raping Congolese did not indicate that he hated their race or any race . Damp-eyed , he spoke of his love for so many old and faithful souls , how the very sight of these old and faithful souls brought a lump to his throat . At the conclusion of the address , an old and faithful soul was released upon the platform to shake the judge 's hand as the crowd burst spontaneously into Dixie . All present were amused at the epilogue , when the youthful trophy winner revealed himself as an unlicensed fifteen-year-old girl . Before a chili parlor in the oil town of Houma a man with an urge to kill encountered a man with a premonition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Shreveport , the local newspaper announced its sponsorship of a quick-draw contest with cap pistols as a feature of the annual rodeo ; the contest open to all white adults . There followed a digest of the week 's segregation protests includinga number of militant statements by Negro leaders that was marked for attention by Southern subscribers . People were being locked up in McComb and Jackson ; there was a march in Birmingham , a boycott in Montgomery , a little street rough stuff in Memphis and New Bern , North Carolina . In Mobile , a Baptistminister pointed out that it was legally impossible for a coloredman to get his feet wet in the Gulf of Mexico for some six hundred miles , unless he contrived to fall off a shrimp boat . A Negro citizen of Biloxi then horrified weekend bathers by darting past desperate policemen and immersing himself to the neck  --  the beach was closed . The subsequent evening by the moonlight was punctuated with exchanges of small arms fire on the edge of the Negro district . Next came a few carefully worded declarations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement , by a big city negro congressman to his constituents , that " the White Man was on the run "  --  both put on the line for the clients in Dixie.  |p109But  an obliging editor in New York had provided the piece de resistance  --  a bad one , a big bad one , a real chiller diller for the folks down home . A minister 's wife from Tulsa on a solitary search for the RockefellerMemorial Church had been rousted in the 116th Street I.N.D . station by the traditional six foot spade , backed to the wall , cut , although not badly , and raped . New York had served it up with all the trimmings . Rheinhardt read it over , whistling softly through his teeth . WUSA would use that one , Rheinhardt thought . It was a red , white and blue thunderbolt if ever there was one . He marked it , leaving in all the side effects  --  the unfortunate lady 's reflections , the shock and horror of kith and kin in godly Tulsa , the works . Armed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top , made some sharp one-liners out of the internationalstuff with a premium on Castro , stuffed the middle with the first or last paragraphs of the assembled racial routines and a sprinkling of the jazzier neutral items . The piece closed with a reverent thirty seconds on the lady from Tulsa and a harmless Pete Smith style comedy accident that happened to a man in Venice fixing his roof . That would be it  --  five minutes . And what did it look like ? Reading it through again , Rheinhardt felt a curious chill about the edges of his spinal column . How could it be so easy ? The rhythm of instinct  --  that must be it ; you did n't even have to think about it particularly and there it was ready to press , five minutes of sheer eagles and lightning . The cumulative effect of it was really something to read . And to hear , Rheinhardt thought , something to hear  --  all five minutes of it . WUSA  --  The Truth Shall Make You Free .

" Have fun , " she told him.  |p110Jack  Noonan was outside , walking up and down with a programsheet . " OK , " Rheinhardt said . " Fine , " Noonan said , reopening his smile . " I was giving up on you. , , " Where 's the engineer ? " " Irving , " Jack Noonan called , still smiling at Rheinhardt . One of the men in shirt sleeves , a tall young man with thinuncombed red hair and horn-rimmed glasses came over to them . " Irv , baby , this man 's gon na read to us . Want to get himtaped ? " " C'm on , " Irving said . They went down a flight of cement stairs and into an empty studio on the floor below . Bits of heavy brown wrapping paper were still lying about the floor ; the equipment was new and sparkling . " There 's your mike , " Irving said pointing to a gleaming turn table unit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irving went into the control booth to turn on his machines . " What is it ? Five minutes ? " " Right , " Rheinhardt said . " Say something . " " Double Yew Yew Ess A , " Rheinhardt said . " The Voice of An American 's America . " Irving smiled bemusedly behind the glass . " WUSA , " the machine came back , " The voice of an American'sAmerica . . . . " " Breathy , " Irving said . " What ? " " Breathy , " Irving said . " You know  --  with breath ? " Rheinhardt looked up . " Oh . I 'll try to get some palate in there . " " That 's the way , " Irving said , and made little clicking sounds with his tongue and palate . " Lots palate . " " You want me to start right in ? "  | " Take your time . Pick up anytime after I give you the marker . " Both he and Rheinhardt turned to the wall clock . Irvingwaved a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yew Yew Ess A , " Rheinhardt began . . . " WUSA Insider 's Report . . . Havana . " It ran a shade under five minutes . Irving closed the switches and came out of the booth . " So , " he said . " A lot happened . " " A little of this and a little of that , " Rheinhardt said . " OK . You know the way up ? Go tell Jack I got it if he wants to hear it . " " Thanks . " " Anytime , " Irving said . " You want to hear it ? " " No , " Rheinhardt said . " Maybe later . " Rheinhardt went up the stairs and found Jack Noonan and the girl taking coffee at the ticker room desk . " Ready ? " Noonan asked him . " Yeah , " Rheinhardt said . " He has it . " " Good , good . Just have a seat somewhere . Marge , " he said to the girl , " get him a magazine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . The two of them went toward the stairway . Rheinhardt sat down on the desk and spent the next five minutesor so , reading an article on creativity in the Ladies ' Home Journal . When he had finished that , he noticed that he was still holding the sheaf of copy he had prepared for the broadcast . He crumpled it and tossed it on the floor , then read the letters to the editor and the movie reviews . Neither Noonan or the girl appeared to be coming back . He stood up and went over to the window to watch them haul equipment off the elevator , smoking one cigarette and then another . The shirt-sleeved men were still standing around , doing nothing in particular , paying no attention to him . About twenty minutes after he had gone out , Jack Noonan came back in , alone.  |p112He  looked at Rheinhardt and shrugged . " Ever met M. T. Bingamon ? " " No , " Rheinhardt said . " He 'd like to see you . " " Is he going to hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Noonan said . " C'm on . " There were three large empty storerooms beyond the teletype enclosure with more splintering shelves and bits of tissue paper wadded in the corners . The air conditioners were not working there ; they were airless and dead hot , carrying a faint presence of cheap cloth , moldering wood and discarded lunches . Above the largest , the center room , ran a strangely ornate balustrade that circled past some twenty small circular windows which had been sealed with opaque yellow paint so that the fierce sunlight outsidefiltered through to charge the railing and the upper part of the room with ocher light . Jack Noonan walked ahead fanning himself with the ticker copy . " Mad , huh , " he asked Rheinhardt as they went . " Like a crazy roller-skating rink . " " Lots of room , " Rheinhardt said , blinking up at the yellow ceiling . " That 's why we 're moving , " Noonan told him . " Y'see , it used to be piled full of beds . The story is that old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In one he had a shop that turned out cheap caskets for niggers and the other he kept full of beds that he sold to the cathouses in Storeyville . He sold them on time before anybody else did that and he was good buddies with the cops . Whenever they staged one of their raids , the old man would come along to repossess the beds and sell then over again somewhere else . He did that like hundreds of times . Then he got rich and respectable and pretty soon he owned the whole building right down to the street . " " He must have been a great old man , " Rheinhardt said . " Yeah , he had something going for him , " Jack Noonan said . " Imagine thinking that up . "  |p113At  the end of the last room , they went through a finished maple door marked Keep Out and into an air-conditioned room where a number of middle-aged women were working over thick loose-leaf folders . Rheinhardt followed Jack Noonan through to another door . " Mailing lists , " Noonan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grand into collecting them and a couple of grand more into public opinion research . How many stations you ever hear of doing that ? " The last room was an office with wood panelling and a set of French windows overlooking motionless Canal Street . The walls were hung with maps of the city and lithographed sea engagementsfrom the War of 1812 . Behind the dark antique desk was a panel hung with autographed photos of golfers and polo players , enlargements of grazing African wildlife , of a handsome graying man in safari gear with a speckled band across his slouch hat  --  Bingamon himself . There were a great many movie faces  --  some stylized publicity shots , and some posed in informal groups with Bingamon . All were autographed and inscribed with sentiments ; they gave the room the air of a celebrity barbershop or a theatrical delicatessen . Bingamon had come in immediately behind them ; when they turned from the desk he was halfway across the room , one hand adjusting his horn-rimmed spectacles , the other outstretched in greeting . " Hi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jack Noonan said , " this is Mr. Rheinhardt . " Rheinhardt had already shaken the outstretched hand , but this done he experienced some little difficulty in getting loose , so that as Jack Noonan walked out of the room he found himself standing in the center of the carpet holding hands with Matthew J. Bingamon. " have a seat , Mr. Rheinhardt , " Bingamon said , turning him loose . Rheinhardt sat down on a leather chair beside the desk and watched him . He was a particularly big man . He wore no jacket and his quiet striped tie was loosened at the collar of a short/sleeved button-down shirt . There was nothing of age about him though his hair was gray , nearly white . His face was clear  --  tight and tanned . He was not , as far as Rheinhardt could see , what one would call a Hollywood type . He looked nothing at all like a grasping factor . His whole appearance and manner had a perfect balance between easily carried urban elegance and an outdoor muscularity compressed with good-natured reluctance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a singular and formidable cool . " I heard your tape , Rheinhardt , " Matthew Bingamon said . " I liked it pretty well . " " Good , " Rheinhardt said . " Good . " " It was very selective and it was very well delivered . " Rheinhardt lit a cigarette and nodded modestly . " Thank you , " he said . " You seem to have come by a good sound constitutional grounding . That 's something of a rarity in a young man . " Rheinhardt settled back with a look of polite interest . He was beginning to get the pain in his back again . " Well , I 've worked a good deal with news . . . " Bingamon laughed pleasantly . " You never picked it up at radio stations . You 'll have to tell me a lot more about yourself one of these times . And you 'll get a chance to because I believe I liked your tape well enough to hire you . " " Fine , " Rheinhardt said . " Fine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bingamon said , whipping off his glasses with the same razor-sharp gesture he had used before , " that we could have any misunderstanding about why your being taken on  --  but just in case , I 'll tell you exactly why . When I listened to that spot I was able to see a picture . A part of a pattern . If I had listened to any other five minute straight news broadcast on any other station it would have been obscured , would n't it ? But because you see it , you made me see it . " " The pattern , " Rheinhardt said . " Yes . " " Well the news , so called , is a very important part of whatp115we 're trying to do with WUSA . Because there is a pattern . But it 's hard , Rheinhardt , it 's very hard to get across . Every honest man in this country feels it  --  and not only in the South  --  but everywhere in the country . They feel it , they pick up a trace of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business it is to keep that pattern obscured . From our point of view these peopleare the enemy . " " Right , " Rheinhardt said . " Right . " " People ca n't see because they do n't have the orientation , is n't that right ? And a lot of what we 're trying to do is to give them that orientation . " " Certainly , " Rheinhardt said eagerly . " Well you realize that , I 'm sure , " Bingamon said , standing up . " You 'd have to realize that or that you would n't have been able to make up the sort of copy I just listened to . " " Aha , " Rheinhardt said . " Well all right then , Mr. Rheinhardt . " Rheinhardt rose from his chair . " You could be quite a find for the station . I really like your delivery .

" Well you could think I was a damn fool . That 'd hold you back some . " Rheinhardt watched him . The man 's face was sheer bonhomie . " Why would I think that ? " Bingamon laughed and dismissed his own words with a shrug . " Well I do n't mean that exactly . I mean you might underestimatethe seriousness of what we 're trying to do . If you did , you know . . . you 'd be all wrong for us. "  | " It 's important work , " Rheinhardt said . " Certainly I realized that . " He swallowed , easing the dryness in his throat .

" Really , " Bingamon said . " I 'm having one . " " Oh all right , " Rheinhardt said . " Thank you . A short one . " He watched Bingamon fill the two liquor glasses and carefully accepted the drink , raised it and swallowed it . When it was down he knew it had been a mistake .

" " Mr. Rheinhardt , " Bingamon said without the faintest irony , " it 's been a pleasure meeting you , sir . " Rheinhardt went out , past the women at their mailing lists and down a long flight of back stairs . He had to stop once , in order to come to terms with the number of steps and the manner of their arrangement ; it seemed there were a great many concentrated in too narrow a shaft . Coming out on the street , he found it difficult to take the sun . Food would do it , he thought walking slowly and sedately down Basin Street ; if he could get some food and keep it down , he would be able to taper out of the dives on a few beers . It occurred to him that his wallet now contained one hundred dollars . At Iberville there was a seafood restaurant that was crowded with tourists looking as though they might have come from church ; he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a quart bottle of beer . He paid with one of the twenties and watched with quiet fascination as the bartender counted out his change . From somewhere in the country of the dives and lights , he could hear the pompous intonations , the sly simpering of his voice as it must have sounded on the tape . It would not be necessary to hear that particular tape , he thought , he had heard himself that way often enough before . But never in such an exercise as that . No . That had been quite an exercise for a hot Sunday morning . A new Rheinhardt , he thought , a wonderful new Rheinhardt with sound constitutional grounding . He considered the new Rheinhardt , it 's careful enunciation , it 's quiet good manners , it 's suit and pointed shoes . Why not ? Well , he addressed himself , you hear these things , you read them and you wonder who dreams them up . Now you know . Where did you learn to do that ? he inquired of himself in his new Rheinhardt voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just a routine . I have a lot of routines and that 's just one of them . Wait , the voice persisted , a measure of credit is due . You reached down there and transmuted life 's baser metal into solid gold . You wrote that . You did . Well , Rheinhardt replied , finishing his beer , it 's all instinctive . People have this in their heads and when you hear them come on you get so you can serve it up for them . You 'll observe that it was really all news . It really happened . Of course . But it is n't really that way . What do you mean it 's not that way ? It happened did it not ? If you want it that way , that 's the way it is . But you know better . Do n't you feel at all responsible . . . Responsible to what ? Responsible to you ? What are you worth , you nickle sack of piety and wit ? If you think I 'm lousing up your world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see . You 're all rancor because you 're such a son of a bitch . I went in there a son of a bitch and I came out the same way except now I have some money and I 'm eating shrimp . You like shrimp , do n't you ? I love shrimp . I have always loved shrimp . What 's the matter , do you find that gross ? Is that a betrayal of the spirit or something , my whining fat boy of a soul ? Does that bug you ? See ! See ! You do feel it ! You feel you 've betrayed something . Your honor . .. ! Please ! All right . Not your honor . Your perception , how 's that ? Your intellect . You can take my perception , you can take my intellect , and you can . . . All right . Hold ! Enough ! If you stop , I 'll buy you a drink ! Fine ! Rheinhardt called to the barman in the voice from thetape . " I wonder , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot of Jim Beam ? " The barman smiled sadly . " Outside , " he said , " so hot . You want a shot after all that beer and shrimp ? Make me sick , me , if I drank it . " " I 'll tell you something , " Rheinhardt said , " I 've spent the lastseven years in Fernando Poo on the West Coast of Africa . " The bartender looked at him ; the fat man opening oysters atthe ice table stopped and turned . " And in Fernando Poo it was twice as hot as you 've ever seen it in this city of New Orleans . " " Yeah ? " the bartender said . " Right , " Rheinhardt said . " It was just immobilizing . It would knock you on your ass , that 's how hot it was ! " The bartender glanced nervously at several tourist couples in prim seersucker who sat farther down the bar eating their oysters . " Let 's keep it down , " he said , serving up the Jim Beam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , grandly accepting his drink , " in the afternoons out there in Fernando Poo we would all go down to the beach in the hottest part of the day and the splendid Ashanti oarsmen would beach their dugout canoes and hail us with cries of Jambo ! Jambo ! which means  --  " he paused to down the shot  --  " which means Peace ' in their melodic language . Jazz started with the Ashanti , you know . They have a natural sense of rhythm . " " Is that right ? " the bartender asked , glancing round again . " Well , sir , we 'd go down there and from their ebony canoes the Ashanti would haul out great masses of shrimp which we would boil in merry wrought-iron cauldrons and eat in dozens with Cayenne pepper after the manner of Paul du Chaillu . And that done we would lie back on the burning sand , our swollen bellies heaving in the merciless sun and drink each a quart of bourbon . " " Good Christ , " the bartender said , walking away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please . I 'm celebratingmy return to Christendom . " " Make this the last , sir , " the bartender said . Rheinhardt drank it and saw the oyster opener staring at him . " Jambo , " he said pleasantly . " So these here Ashansis like to eat up a big mess of shrimps and drink a bottle of bourbon ? " the oyster opener inquired . " Yes , " Rheinhardt said . " They 're a wonderful folk . " " Sounds about like what a nigger would do , " the man said , carving the rim of a shell . Rheinhardt stood up quickly setting his stool to totter and right itself against the bar . " Niggers ! " he cried loudly , " Niggers ! Listen I do n't patronize joints where persons of color are called by lousy epithets ! " The place went silent . The bartender and waiter started forward ; the man at the oysters looked round a bit fearfully . One step ahead of the waiter another man in a white jacket made for the seersuckered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called out , " I do n't accommodate that rebop . " The women retreated from the stools , their escorts looked at each other and came forward . " Liberal , huh , " one of them said wiping his mouth with a paper napkin . They were not very big men , Rheinhardt saw . He felt strangely and vaguely disappointed . " Liberal , " Rheinhardt screamed , " Yes ! A liberal . A Decembrist ! Down in the bowels of the earth caked with layers of dryingmud there 's a giant bell , daddy , down at the bottom of the sea swinging silently , and that 's my bell , daddy , because I 'm a liberal . " " He 's crazy , " one of the women said softly . " Liberal , huh ? " the smaller of the two men said . They were both very pale . They kept trying to place themselves between Rheinhardt and the women . Rheinhardt felt a hand clawing at his jacket from behind . The oyster opener , implement in hand was coming around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled . " My husband is n't well , " one of the women called shrilly . " You 're a dirty Lovestoneite " Rheinhardt shouted over a man 's shoulder , " you killed Sydney Hillman ! " One of the men in seersucker hit him lightly on the face ; he laughed . Someone else was trying to bend his arm behind him . " My suit ! " Rheinhardt cried and wrenched . " Listen , lady , " he said , " when the bomb falls I hope it falls on your shivering buttocks ! I hope it knocks you through a brick wall and you deliver yourself of a ghastly mutation ! I 'm a liberal ! " " Hold him for the cops , for godsakes , " the oysterman said . " The man 's in-sane ! " A small grayhaired man in a waiter 's uniform hit Rheinhardt on the back of the neck . " Cops , we do n't need , " he said . " Just get him out . " Rheinhardt , strangely relaxed and unable to turn his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of a Ford Falcon.  | " Do n't you never come near this place again , you animal , " the little old man told him . At two o'clock Geraldine woke up alone ; Rheinhardt had gone to the radio station . She got out of bed and opened the sooty black shutters on the warm richness of afternoon , the wind came against her face charged with blossoms and soft sunlight . " God , " she thought and backed away startled into the room 's darkness to light a cigarette . It had been a wind so filled with bland promise and spring conjure that her heart had quickened on it unprepared , rising to a thrill of joy that fell away , in the first minute of her waking consciousness to sudden distrust , a bitter resentment and at last despair . " Shit , " Geraldine said and put the cigarette out against the seared edge of her night table . It was going to be a hard day to fight . Above the dirty gables of the adjoining roof the sky was merciless and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dungarees and a white blouse and a cheap black raincoat she had bought the day before at Maison Blanche , and went across the street to the Eustace Luncheonette . Crossing , she kept her eyes down and half shut , she walked huddled in her raincoat as from a storm . It should n't be too long before he got back she thought , they should n't keep him there all of the day . She wanted him that morning . In the luncheonette , she bought a confession magazine and ordered a fried egg sandwich and coffee . She took a stool near the window where she could look up now and then to the entrance of the hotel  --  but he did not come back . She remembered seeing a park a few blocks up from the hotel where there were benches under the magnolia trees and when she had drunk a second cup of coffee she went outside and up Versailles Street to look for it . It was two blocks away , between the post office buildings on Lafayette Square and the first warehouse row that rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general and ap123carpet of bright new grass coming up strangely green and opulent from the caked brown earth and dead winter weeds of the lawn . The gnarled magnolias along its tarred path were blossoming , scenting the air . Old men sat at the delicate curlicued benches in groups of two or three , baring stained teeth in silent laughter , nodding together ; wrinkled dewlaps stretched in recollection over the starched yellow points of Sunday collars . It was very quiet there , quiet enough to hear the hum and whine of tires from the freeway ramp half a mile away and the motor barges on the river . There were no children . She sat down at the first bench and read a magazine story about a girl from the country who had married a well-spoken older man with lovely manners who later turned out to be this terrible maniac . Tough  --  Geraldine thought  --  you could n't work up much sympathy for a girl that simpleminded and anywayit was n't even true , she had read it before about a hundred times in other magazines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had god-awful pictures and they left you feeling rotten but they did have things in them like the things that really happened . She set the magazine beside her and watched a burned old man , his hair back in a double braid like Buffalo Bill 's , who was towing a child 's wagon full of empty soda bottles from one trash can to the next . He made it look like there was a lot in knowing just how to do it , Geraldine thought , like it was right important . She smiled up at him as he passed her but he looked away , far away it seemed to her , toward the sky across the river , like a farmer hoping for rain . The bottles in his wagon rattled together as he went on . Geraldine put her hands in her raincoat pockets and leaned back against the bench boards . The wind was reaching her again , warm , sweet smelling , without the slightest edge , innocent as the sky that brought it . It would be hard to tell somebody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day like this . Because it was beautiful , by God , it was as beautiful as you could ever want . She felt a sudden urge to find the darkest end of the darkest rankest bar on Decaturp124Street and drink herself sodden . But then , she could n't go back there now , not even for that . Geraldine closed her eyes to the sky feeling her lips go cold with the taste of the thing ; the soft sounds around her whispered with the voice of the man that had held it ( Little one ! Little one ! ) She sat up straight , open-eyed now  --  the sun was bright on rippling grass , the old man 's shadow stark across the lawn . She stood up and went quickly from the park , back toward the Roma Hotel . He had to be back now  --  it was after four  --  he had to . And he would be  --  he 'd be in there fumbling around with glasses or crapped out in a chair . She walked quickly in rising excitement , infected again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A block from the Roma , a motorcycle policeman sat astride his machine and watched her come up . She walked slowly past him to the curb ; his insect mask of white helmet and dark glasses pivoted to follow her . Geraldine smiled at him , regarding with wary good nature the pink flush of face around his blacked-out eyes . You 're about an animal son of bitch , ai n't you , she asked him silently ; she reckoned him twenty inches around the neck , face like a lambchop . The corner light was red ; she waited it as he watched her silently . " Nice day to be out ridin ' on a motorcycle , " Geraldine told him , squinting concernedly at the empty street . " Pretty fair , " the cop said . " You live around here ? " " Oh I sure do n't , " Geraldine said . " I come down to look for that there sightseeing boat . " " There ai n't none , " the cop said . " There ai n't huh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll just go home and change for church . " ' Walking the next block , she heard his boot come down on the pedal and the machine-gun clatter of his engine turning over ; she went deliberately past the door of the Roma , thinking that , after all , you ought not to get gay with those people . You never could tell where you 'd be when you met them the next time . She heard the machine bear down on her and walked slowly until the copp125came abreast , holding the cycle beneath him in explosive restraint . " Hey , " he called to her , breaking into gear , " what all happened to your face there ? " She looked up into the eyeless gaze and saw his tongue come out , brushing thick pink lips with satisfaction . The son of a bitch , she thought . When he had turned the corner , she doubled quickly back and ran up the steps of the Roma . At the door she paused afraid to try and listen , and brushed her hair back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not there . " Goddamn it , " she said . She sat down on the bed flushed with disappointment her arms loose at her sides . " Ah , goddamn it . " The sunlight streamed in through the window , with the chirpingof sparrows and the river sounds . She went over and looked in the closet  --  his things were still there , his suitcase , his iron . Damnit , there was n't a reason in the world for him to leave like that . And what if he had n't just left ? Geraldine lay on the bed again and leaned back pouting on the pillows , holding her hands cupped over her ears . It did n't seem like any use  --  she could n't make sense out of it . Who was he , this Rheinhardt ? It was him that did n't make sense . Sometimes she could picture him real well , she could hear his voice on certainwords and see him doing something , pickin ' on his ear or something . But when you tried to put him all together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd made up . She lay on the bed for a long time trying to make sense out of things , out of this Rheinhardt and the rest of it . You 're looking to hang on again , she told herself , you 're a fool tryin ' that . You 're tryin ' to hang on to him and you ca n't even make out who he is . But you got to hang on , she thought . You got to hang on because if you lose hold you 'll just break up and drift off and go washin ' off the edge of this fuckin ' world , you 'll just melt down into a sprinkle of powder with nobody there , you 'll be sawdust for them to sweep up or spit into.  | " Goddamn , Rheinhardt , " she said in the empty room , " they 're about to lay me low , buddy . " She lay on the bed thinking about how the breaking up and washing away would be , while the window and the room went dark . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next roof , the Dipper stars and the North Star for some reason it brought up the thought of the man with the brass knuckles and what he 'd said  --  she knew why that was , it was because of her father . ' Whenever she thought about that man now , her father would somehow come up in it . God , and that was so wrong , she thought , how could it come that they be mixed up together ? She went to the window , leaned out smelling the night air until the brass taste and the man 's voice were her father ; she looked at the stars and saw him  --  lean , wrinkled in the face though he was not an old man as she remembered him , his breath strong with the smell that she came to know was the beer and whiskey of a miner 's boiler-maker , the stubble of his cheek and his voice talking about stars . It seemed to her that once , on an evening , she had stood with him at night and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . ( " Little one , " the man with the brass knuckles had called her , " Little one . " ) She kept on looking until she could feel her legs trembling at the first sob growing up from inside her and it was as if her mind were on a roller going faster and faster and off the track . So she knew then what the breaking down and blowing away would be like  --  the end of it , not caring  --  like if Woody had the gun that night in Port Arthur . She turned from the window feeling as though she were being sucked under a wave of time and things , as though it were finally rising up to strike her down  --  a wave of jagged-edged days and nights with pointed iron spines smelling of wet brass and blood that carried along with it her father and L.J . and the sweaty fingeredhands of the freak trade and voices calling through darkness and blurred light to make her sick with fear at the sound of her own name and fists across the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissing tongues of men smellingp127of puke , and God , she thought leaning against the shutters , they 're layin ' me low buddy . She remembered , with relief , that it was going to be time to go to work . She turned on the light , washed her face , combed her hair and then made the bed . Then slowly and carefully she took out a broom and dustpan from the closet and started sweeping corners and cleaning up the cigarette butts and spilled drinks around the bed . Then she put her raincoat on and walked down the nearly empty street to the corner of Canal to catch the bus . She passed the night making herself think about the work until she was half hypnotized by the lines of soap canisters and the dull glare of the fluorescent lights . At lunch break , the girls were talking about their divorces and the men they had been married to ; Geraldine stayed out of it that night . She bought two sandwiches instead of one ; she had not eaten anything since getting up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after knock-off she had a feeling that Rheinhardt might have come out to wait for her at the bus stop but by the time she went out to find it empty she was too tired and empty to care very much . She sat on the bench and listened to the music drift up from the strip of road houses across the parish line on U.S. 90 until the bus came up to take her dreamily passed the shuttered black houses of Elysian Fields and back to Canal Street . Just to make sure of sleeping , she bought two quart bottles of beer in a bar on St. Charles Avenue and then went straight up to the room . She let herself in and set the beer down as soon as she 'd been inside a minute or two she began to feel jumpy again . So she gathered up the bottles and went through the hall to the rear wooden balcony that led to Philomene 's room . It was completely dark on the balcony , too dark to make out even the edges of the surrounding buildings that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railposts toward the light under Philomene 's door , trying the way with her foot . In the black courtyard below , the cats had started in to fill the darkness with their echoing howls that always sounded to Geraldine likep128the screaming of infants . It would be light soon , they seemed always to begin just before dawn . " Philomene , " Geraldine called . " Where you at ? " She could hear Philomene pushing aside the bureau that she kept blocking her door at night . The door opened finally and Philomene herself stood peering into the darkness through the spectrum layers of her eyeglasses . " Geraldine ? " " Uh huh . I was wantin ' to buy a bug off y ' today , honey . I did n't see you when I come in . " Philomene stepped back into the room , Geraldine followed and helped her push the bureau back against the door . " Listen to them cats , " Philomene said smiling as they heaved . " You hear ' em . They just the same as we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a very small room with a slanted wall on the side where the bed was . There was a stale smell in the place , the floor and the square of linoleum under the sink were littered with soiled Bar-B-Q cups and potato chip wrappers . " Well , you know , the man did n't give me slips , Geraldine , so 's I ca n't sell you one today . I went out to meet him yesterday and he ai n't there . I think maybe they close the bank down and he has to go see somebody about it . " " Oh , " Geraldine said . " Well I got some beer here if you like . " " Umm , " Philomene took an opener from the sink , pried off the cap and drank , licking suds from her light blond mustache . " I hope it do n't make me see things , " she said . " It 'll do that sometimes . Where 's your boyfriend at ? " " I do n't know where , " Geraldine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mornin ' . " " Huh , " Philomene said . " Where 'd he tell you he was goin ' ? " " He was goin ' out after a job at this radio station . That 's just about one day ago and he never did come back . " " That boy could of worked for a radio station . I was listenin ' at your door one night and I heard him comin ' on . He was some talker. "  | " Yeah , " Geraldine said , " he could of all right . " " Did he have any money of yours with him ? " " Shit , " Geraldine said , " not as I know of . I do n't even care about that . " Philomene lifted her quart bottle to the light , shook it and looked with satisfaction at the line of foam . " He 'll probably come back if he can , love , " she told Geraldine . " I had a feelin ' when I saw that boy said he 's the boy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was gon na hit the number that day and he did n't . " " Well see there , " Geraldine said . " It 's a funny thing , " Philomene said , handing over the beer , " you could have said something that pissed him off and never even knowed it . I 'm always doin ' that with my men friends . Sometimes they do n't never come back . " " I do n't know , " Geraldine said . " I do n't know . I did n't think he would just leave . I do n't know what I thought . " " Damn , " Philomene said quietly . " What 's the matter ? Are you startin ' to see things ? " " I thought maybe . . . but I do n't guess . Look behind you there . You see anything whirley or funny lookin ' ? " Geraldine turned and looked over her shoulder at the red painted dresser lodged against the door . " No . I mean I do n't think so . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Neither do I. What I was thinkin ' though was about a boyfriend I had one time what reminded me some of your boyfriend . A Indian . " " I used to know a fella that was part Indian blood , " Geraldine said . " Name of Woody . " " Yeah well this Indian boy , I sure thought he was the boy for me . He reminds me of your boyfriend except he was really a whole lot better lookin '  --  Lord , he was just built like a truck and he had all oiled-down hair . I do n't remember where it was I met him . But come time I did n't see no more of him and one night I was drinkin ' beer to home here and I went to sleep  --  lights was off and I woke up and there he was bendin ' down overp130me and he says Philomene , you ai n't about to see me no more ' cause I 'm goin ' back to Sioux City . That 's where he was from  --  Sioux City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They a whole lot of Indians up there . But the fact is I do n't think he was really here that night because I had the bureau up against the door like it is now . " " Huh , " Geraldine said . " You ever see him again ? " " Oh yeah , I seen him again but only when I was drinkin ' beer . " " Huh , " Geraldine said . " What other things you see ? " " Well I mostly see men , Geraldine . Men and things . " " Men and things , " Geraldine said . " Did you ever go have a doctor look at your head , Philomene ? Did anyone ever tell you why it was you saw them things ? " " Well one time , " Philomene said , " I was out by Tulane lookin ' for a boyfriend , and I seen this real cute young boy standin ' around by the duck pond so I went on up to be friendly . Well that poor scared little thing did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a student , I think . " " Was you grabbin ' on him ? " Geraldine asked her . " Shit no , " Philomene said , opening the second beer . " I was n't . But here come this cop to take me down . We went to the Charity and I seen a doctor there but he did n't tell me nothin ' . Finally when I was supposed to go have a X-ray of my chest I put my coat on and came home , and I ai n't seen a doctor since . " " Why do you think it is you see them ? " " I do n't rightly know , Geraldine . " " Do you see them without your glasses ? " " Without my glasses I see them like I see things without my glasses . But if they talk , then I hear them better . " " Damn , " Geraldine said , " you ought a have that looked at . " " My boss says that too . I think he 's scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned in right and honest so he do n't mind too much . "  | " Seems you could sure get in a hell of lot of trouble goin ' up to people that way . You got a lot of good luck goin ' for you . More than me , by God . " " I ai n't so bad as I 'm painted , " Philomene said . " But I 've met some bad ones . Some of them been the craziest sonbitches you ever saw . I mean real crazy men . " " What did they do ? " " Oh hell I do n't even remember . I do n't pay them no attentionwhen I see they 're that way . " " You could sure get yourself some trouble it seems to me , " Geraldine said . " There ai n't no way around it , " Philomene said . " It 's always some kind of trouble . Lookit you now , pardon me for bein ' nosey but I 'll bet you got your face cut up by some man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the bed rail and looked down at the floor . " You 're right , " she said . " Sure , there you go . Why when I was livin ' down home I used to think that this love was somethin ' God put down here like cane syrup  --  you could walk out in a brake and suck on if you were pretty enough or whatever . But you and me we know it ai n't like that now . When I thought that I did n't know anything , I never had so much as a boy breathe on me and if one had , honey , you know what , I 'd of come , I ai n't lyin ' . But now I know better than that the same as you do , and I 'll tell you what , it 's all trouble . " " Philomene , " Geraldine said standing up , " everybody 's got to do the way they know how , but now what you do is you go up to people on the street and ask them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't different from . . . from well , sociable polite mixin ' between men and women like . . . even in bars , by God . " " I do n't know as I do so different from what any girl does , " Philomene said . " We all got ta have our own allure . " " Well , " Geraldine said , " just do n't tell me you get to know anything about love that way . "  | " I 'm tellin ' you , honey . Do n't tell me you do n't . " She lifted the beer again , wiping her mouth on the sleeve of her blue work shirt . " I 'm right now puttin ' it down for ye . " " I think they call that sex what you 're talkin ' about . " " Same thing , " Philomene said flatly . Geraldine finished the last of the beer and moved the dresser from the doorway ; outside it was light , the sky gray and thick with rainclouds . The morning pigeons dove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold and rank from the alleys below . Through the ventilator shaft Geraldine could see the metal-cased trucks lined up at the levee warehouses and beyond them the brown swift river dully gilded with pale sheets of the reflected sky . Bells played " Rock of Ages " in the downtown towers , the streets were loud with traffic . " Listen to ' em , " Philomene said , " they startin ' all over again . I 'm gon na go out and take a walk . " " I 'm goin ' to bed , " Geraldine said . She walked out on the balcony , beery and shivering , faintly sick to her stomach . " Hey , Philomene , " she called back into the room . Philomene was drumming on her leg braces with the flat of her nails , hummingsoftly to herself . " You really figure you know somethin ' I do n't know . " " Sure , " Philomene said , " because I got more time to think about the way it is . " " Good night , Philomene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come back again . " She went back to her own room , looked again at Rheinhardt 's things in the closet and went to bed . A noise woke her  --  there was a shaft of light on the linoleum that she had not seen going to bed . Turning her eyes from the pillow she saw that the transom had fallen open ; the noise had been the door closing . She leaned up on her elbow and saw the outline of a man against the shutters  --  he moved around behind her as she started up . " Rheinhardt ? " she said . " Hey who ? " she said . " Hey who ? "  |p133She  got her feet to the floor and sat with a hand to her neck , considering a break for the door . The man 's breath was coming heavy , he sighed wheezingly and his voice thick with an unearthly accent intoned : " They are children of the night . .. " Geraldine moved cautiously along the bed and reached for her raincoat , which was hanging across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " the voice repeated . . " What beautiful music they make . " She snatched up the raincoat and bolted tripping for the door , wrenching it open to stand , the coat clutched before her in the hall . The shutters opened , the gray light coming in caught Rheinhardt slipping into a chair by the window . He looked at her benignly . " Do n't go out . " Geraldine stepped into the room , wadded the raincoat and hurled it to the floor , slamming the door behind her . " You , " she said . You simple-minded fuckhead . " " Why simple-minded ? " Rheinhardt asked . " Wherefore fuck-head ? " " You can go to hell , my friend , " Geraldine said , going back to the bed . " You know ? Why do n't you get your cottonpicking iron and get off ? " Rheinhardt pushed open the second shutter and leaned forward to look somberly down at the courtyard . " I ran into some delays . I 'm sorry . " " You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a rat 's ass where you spend your time , but then do n't come breakin ' my door down and hollerin ' when I 'm tryin ' to sleep . " She crawled under the covers and pulled them over her ear . " Where in the hell are you comin ' from ? " " From going to and fro in the earth , " Rheinhardt said , " and from walking up and down on it . " He went over to the bed and brought several crumpled bills from his trouser pockets which he let fall on Geraldine.  |p134She  turned her head to look at them . " Well that 's plumb wonderful , " Geraldine said . " There must be seven , eight dollars there . I never looked at so much money in my life . " " If you saw how much money I had in my pocket this morning , " Rheinhardt said , sitting down on the bed , " or whatever morning it was , it would break your heart . I got hired . " " You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did . " He lay down beside her outside the spread ; she did not move over for him . He reached up and yanked a part of the pillow from beneath her head stretched back on it . " I got hired by WUSA which is the voice of Almighty God in this part of the forest . I get to call the faithful to prayer . When I walked out , the man put a hundred dollars in my hand . " " I do n't know what all you could find to spend a hundred dollarson in one night . " " You 're getting harder to impress all the time . There 'll be anotherhundred dollars . They have me by the week . " " You get a hundred dollars a week ? " " Every Monday night . " " That 's too much , " Geraldine said sitting up . " I do n't mean how it 's too much money , but it 's just too much . " " Yes , " Rheinhardt said . He turned toward her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiskey into her face . " It 's a good deal . " He yawned and kissed her beside the ear . " Wait a minute , " Geraldine said moving away . " I ai n't operatin ' on your time . " She sat up and grinned at him . " What do you do for them . Announce ? " " Yeah , like that . And I play music . " " What music ? " she asked holding his hand down . " Classic music ? " " Shit no . " He turned back over and loosened his necktie . " Rhythm and blues . Rock and roll . " " Can I tell you what to play ? " " Little friend , you can write the show . Can you sing ? I 'll get you recorded and I 'll play you for two hours . How 's that ? "  |p135Bull  shit , " Geraldine said . " Bull shit , you say  --  I could do it . You can not only tell me what to play , you can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take the pulse of the masses and hip me on what sets their big dirty toes a-tapping . You can be my contact . " " Hey , wait a minute , " Geraldine said . " Where the hell you been all day and night ? " " Well , " Rheinhardt said , " I got a little hung up with the scene they had going down at this place so I did a little meditating . And a little drinking . " " Like all goddamn night ! " " I did n't drink all night , " Rheinhardt said , " only part of it . I also rented us a pad and I went to the movies . I saw Dracula . Bela Lugosi . " He closed his eyes and intoned again : " They are children of the night . . . " " Yeah , I know , " Geraldine said . " What beautiful music they make . Did you really rent a pad ? Where is it ? " " Over in the Quarter . On St. Philip Street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , smiling . " I would n't ever of believed it . You gon na let me come with you ? " " Why not ? " " Goddamn , Rhein buddy . " She put her hand across his hair and went to pick up her raincoat from the floor . " I 'd say you were doin ' the right thing . " " Lady , " Rheinhardt said getting up , " one thing the people that know me say they say  --  that Rheinhardt , he always does the right thing . You want to go see it now ? " " Well , I do n't know I ai n't slept or nothin ' . " " Sleep there . " " Aw hell , OK . Let me get my gear together . " She opened the closet and began taking things out . There was not very much . " Hey , is this place got furniture ? " " It had when I saw it last . " She opened her net cotton bag and stuffed a slip and blouses inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Christ , I do n't know , " Rheinhardt said , inspecting his iron . " Do they usually give you dishes ? " " If they do n't , " Geraldine said , " I can go out and buy a whole mess of them . I can go to the five and ten and buy them out . Only thing is you got to give me money . " " How many people are you planning to feed ? We 're gon na need all the money I have for liquor . And I thought maybe we 'd go out and eat some night . " He brought his suitcase out and stood holding it , waiting for her to get ready . " It somehow never occurred to me that if I brought you I 'd have to eat your cook-ing . " " I can cook , " Geraldine said . " Well I 'll use what 's left out of my pay , then . When I get up I 'll hit that five and ten . " They went out into the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look around the room . " If I do , it 'll make the second time in my life I ever went and bought dishes to start a kitchen with . " She turned to him ; he was leaning on the stair rail watching her , smiling a little . " I sure hope it turns out better this time . " " Sure , " Rheinhardt said softly , moving to close the door behind them . " Sure . " Geraldine went to tell Philomene goodbye , but her room was empty ; she had gone out for that walk . They went downstairs and paid the rent at the first floor office and Rheinhardt went out and got a taxicab . The drive was across Canal and down Chartres Street . Some of the bars they saw were bars Geraldine had been in that night the week before . She watched the people in the street , starting more than once when she thought she was seeing one of the men from that night . But it all looked different now , the people looked just like tourists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and old ; the weathered stone and grillwork pleased her . A smell of coffee and saffron and chicory came through the cab window . On St. Philip Street they got out before a brown stucco house with a green painted wooden gate in its front wall and rows ofp137iron balconies mounting to chimney pots on the roof . She waited , looking at the iron work , while Rheinhardt paid off the cab . " Hey listen , " she told him as they unlocked the gate , " when I go out walkin ' around here you got to come with me . " He smiled at her and they passed into a patio in which ferns and thick fleshed plants and plantain shoots grew up in bursts of green from a patch of rich black earth in the center . There were apartments all around the court on the upper floors connected by a wooden stairway that rose in square stories from the ground . As they climbed the stairs , it began to rain . " Why do you think this is such a mean neighborhood ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I was in some trouble over around here , Rhein . Some guys said I was tryin ' to hustle . They kind of nudged me some . " " They wo n't bother you now , friend , " Rheinhardt said . " Do n't worry about them . " The second movement of the Pastoral Symphony drifted out from behind a closed door on the second floor . Rheinhardt stopped to listen to it awhile . " Crazy , " he said . " You know that one ? " " Yeah , " Rheinhardt said . On the next flight they passed a man on his way down , a very tall young man wearing a rainhat and a raincoat that was too large for him . He glanced at them quickly with very blue , rather frightened eyes ; his large Adam 's apple bobbed above the knob of his necktie . He murmured something that sounded apologetic and hurried on . " A mad cat , " Rheinhardt observed at the landing . They heard the street gate slam shut . Rheinhardt opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckon ' ? " " I do n't know , " Rheinhardt said . " He 's probably something harmless like a morgue attendant or a body snatcher . Harmless but useful . "  |p138The  apartment had three rooms with a kitchen , very little furniture  --  there was an air-conditioner in the back window , a gas heater , and a set of French doors opening to a balcony over the street . Rheinhardt put the heater on ; they closed the doors and went to bed . Geraldine lay on the still cool sheets , feeling his warmth , his hands over her  --  she moved against him , her face close against his shoulder . " Hey , Rheinhardt , " she said laughing . " What hey ? " " Just . . . hey . " " Oh . " His body moved across her , his arm went beneath her , she felt his fingers stir above her breast . " No I mean . . . hey who are you goodbuddy ? " " Not a soul , " Rheinhardt said.  |p141M  ORGAN RAINEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was suspiciously gray and drawn , his plastic rainhat far too small . The skirt of his topcoat reached his shoetops . Schoolgirls flapping across the Civic Center in pastel boots giggled at him , motorists suppressed with difficulty a temptation to run him down , parking lot attendants ground their teeth at him . Two spare Negroes in the driveway of the City Hall garage alerted each other of his approach  --  " Dig , " one cautionedthe other . They watched him pass , with eyes round and innocent as birthday pennies  --  You a fool , white man , they told him silently as he stumbled stepping onto the curb . Patrolman Joseph Molinari , who stood each day from nine to five in the celestial sterility of the City Hall lobby , watched him mount the concrete steps outside and sniffed unpleasantly . Walking casually from his post beside the lobby 's great glass wall , Patrolman Molinari approached the city clerk at the informationdesk and nodded toward the figure outside . " Look , " he told the clerk , " a nut . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had stopped at the glass , and stood with his hands pressed against it , peering in at them . " You better shoot him now , Joe " the city clerk said . " Do n't let him come in . " They watched with mounting irritation as the tall gray-faced man succeeded in locating the entrance and passed through , darting with suspect haste for the elevators . " Ho , " Patrolman Molinari called , starting after him , " can I help you ? " " I . . . I 'm going to the fourth floor , " Morgan Rainey said . " I 'm an employee . " They circled each other warily for several seconds while Mor/gan Rainey fumbled through his pockets , and at last produced a wet plastic wallet that held his identification card . " Right , " the cop said , staring with fury at the laminated card . " Right . Go ahead . " Several hundred loudspeakers were engaged in playing " Stormy Weather " ; there was one in the elevator too . Morgan Rainey stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inside the button a little silver light came on with a futuristic " pling , " but the elevator did not move and the loudspeakers went right on playing . A short gray-haired man in a double-breasted suit stepped into the elevator singing at the top of his voice . " Do n't know why , " the little man sang in a tremulous Irish tenor , " theah 's no sun up in-a the sky . . . Storrrmy Weathuh . " He regarded Morgan Rainey with a politician 's smile and raised his eyebrows flirtatiously . Morgan Rainey removed his hat and bowed slightly . The tenor was followed by three other men , similarly short and gray , who glanced warily at Rainey , smiled broadly at each other and began all to talk at once . " Ah , yes , " one said , " they cut out a section of his intestine . " " Pore Heckellman , they love him on the West Side . " " I 've seen him eat ersters by God , " the third said . " Two dozens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped at the fourth floor and Morgan Rainey walked off into a white void without missing a note of " Stormy Weather . " He walked to a colorless door at the left extremity of the corridor and opened it . A small , pale girl was watching him from behind her electric typewriter . " My name is Morgan Rainey , " Morgan Rainey said . " I 'm a bit late to see Mr. Bourgois . " " Yes , Mr. Rainey , " the girl said and disappeared through yet another door . She was gone for a moment ; the door opened and she beckoned him in . " In here please , Mr. Rainey . "  |p143Inside  , Mr. Bougois was seated squarely at a square white desk . He looked at Rainey and then at the lean brutal face of wall clock behind him that registered twenty minutes after nine . " You are a bit late to see me , are n't you , Mr. Rainey ? " Mr. Bourgois asked . " I believe I am a bit late , Mr. Bourgois , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning fortunately , " Mr. Bourgois said . " You 've already had your briefing have n't you ? " " I have . Yes , sir . " " You know the nature of your duties at least generally ? You 've been sworn in ? Taken your loyalty oath ? " " I have , yes . " " Well , let 's review in brief , Mr. Rainey . Bear in mind you 're a temporary employee  --  an interviewer . Your job stops with the recording of statistics relative to income . You give us the facts and we interpret them to determine the needs of the client . You 'll have a check list  --  we want you indicate the state of the client 's place of residence , persons encountered during interview , cooperativeness , whether they got a car , whether they got a TV  --  all that , understand . Each client has got a caseworker that 's his or her counselor . You ai n't his or her counselor , the caseworker is . You expedite the survey and submit regular reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you subjectivize so we expect you to motivate  --  this is a full time job . Let me underline that . Full Time . " " I understand that , " Morgan Rainey said . " But I had the impressionthere was a limited amount of counseling involved , or at least of case evaluation . I have some background in field service overseas and I thought I could bring those qualifications to this . . . " " Yes , yes , I see , yes , " Mr. Bourgois said . " It 's not that way . That 's a misunderstanding on your own part . You counsel no one . You evaluate nothing . We do that . How can I make that clear enough to you , Mr. Rainey ? " " I understand , " Morgan Rainey said . " This is stage three of the project , Mr. Rainey . All thep144groundwork has been laid . At this stage there 's no counseling or evaluation or analysis or any of those things . Does that make it clear ? I hope that makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Morgan Rainey said . " Now , " Mr. Bourgois went on , " on the day of your primary interview you 'll pick up your portfolio in room 311 . Then you 'll have an opportunity to go into the field with one of your more experienced co-workers . If you run into any problems that you feel incompetent to handle , think about it for a while and if it 's absolutely necessary and you 've let the situation get completely out of control then do n't hesitate to call us . We 'll somehow find the time to help you out . " " Thank you , " Morgan Rainey said . " It 's nothing , " Mr. Bourgois said . " Part of my job . " Mr. Bourgois watched Morgan Rainey leave with a shudder . " My God , " he said . " Did you want me ? " his secretary called . " Yes , " Mr. Bourgois said thoughtfully . " Yes , Marlayna . Bring me that man 's application materials . I want to look over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R file and placed it in Mr. Bourgois ' outstretched hand . She stood at his shoulder while he fingered through it . " Harvard , " said Mr. Bourgois . " The son of a bitch went to Harvard College . Imagine that . " " Oh , Claude , " Marlayna said after a while . " These temporarypeople . . . I 'm frightened . There such dreadful , awful creeps . " " Do n't think about them , honey , " Mr. Bourgois said , grasping her hand reassuringly . " They 're nothing to us . " On Rheinhardt 's day off or on afternoons when he had the late program he would go with Geraldine to the lake or to Audubon Park . At the lake , they would walk along the seawall , watching the boys net crabs , and sit on the flat rocks of the breakwater until after sunset.  |p145For  days on end the lake was deadly calm , and at least once during each of their afternoons there , Rheinhardt would study its sinister steely surface and curse elaborately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geraldine . " It 's the ugliest body of water in the world . " " I like it all right , " Geraldine said . " I 'm always always glad to be on the water . " " It 's unnatural . There are horrible things on the bottom of a lake like that . I mean  --  look at it . " Geraldine watched the brackish water roll in lifeless folds over moss-grown rock . " It 's an opening , " she said . Rheinhardt laughed . " It 's an opening all right . This whole town is an opening . It 's the opening of the world . " " You 're too goddamn smart , " Geraldine said , leaning back on the rock . " If you ever came down home and ran your smart mouth somebody would shoot you . " Rheinhardt rolled over toward her preparing to deliver a mock uppercut , but when he saw her face she was frowning at the sky . " But I would n't . I 'd be folks . I only do things I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head and smiled . " I wish there were more of them . " " I ai n't sorry for you , " Geraldine said . " You get away with more than many . " " Of course , " Rheinhardt agreed . " You know that lake is forty miles long and three foot deep ? If it was n't for the mud you could walk to Mandeville . " " You know what I mean by an opening ? " " Sure , " Rheinhardt said , " that 's the water mystique  --  lets the fresh air in and like that . You think if there 's water you can split from an uncool scene . Lot 's of people are like that . They like the water because they think they have a navy out there and somebody will always lower a boat for them . " " That 's what I need , " Geraldine said . " I need a navy . " " Well do n't look at me . I 'm not a navy . "  | " Hey , Rheinhardt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy were n't you ? " " Yeah . " " Was you a musician in the navy ? " " I was a radioman . I went to the Antarctic . " " It was after that you was a musician . " " Yes , " Rheinhardt said , " it was after that , and I was n't just any musician . I was hot stuff . " " I 'm gon na buy you a clarinet , you know , so I can get to hear you play it . " " I could n't play " On the Banks of the Wabash " now . I got no armiture . " " What 's that ? " " It 's like mouth muscle . No , " he told her , " I do n't care about that now . I take care of my mouth by juicing and talking all the time . But sometimes it bothers me that I have nothing to do with my fingers . And sometimes I have trouble with the musicalpart of my mind . " " You need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned over Geraldine and whispered into her hair . " Sweetheart , if you were being chased you 'd run to water , would n't you ? " " Sure . It 's hell being chased on land . You got ta run over ditches and past people and through traffic . I 'd run right for the water . " " I know what you mean , " Rheinhardt said . " I really do know . " " It 's hell being chased . " " I know , " Rheinhardt said . " I 'd run to the water and drownd . " Rheinhardt lay back , resting his face beside hers . From the angle at which he lay , he saw the scars on her face as white laces against her goldening sunburn and freckled skin . The line of her jaw was hard , he thought , but her eyes were beautiful  --  softgazedeyes ; in the same equation her body was large-boned and fleshy , but her hair was very soft . She had long fingers with largep147knuckles , there was a film of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin of her body was soft blond skin . He touched the hair that pooled on her shoulder . " Do n't drown . " When she turned to him , he looked at her for a moment and then sought , despite the closeness of her face to his , to look away . He rolled his eyes back and watched the darkening empty sky . " Do n't let the bastards force you to extremes . When you get to the water do n't drown . " He sat up so that her face was below his . " Me , I 'm a master of escape and I 'm a master of disguise . When they force me to the water I 'll devolve , man , I 'll unevolutionize . I 'll turn back into an amphibian while you wait and disappearin a flurry of fins . " " I could n't do anything like that , babe . I do n't have the education . I 'd just have to drownd , I guess . " " You have to learn then , " Rheinhardt said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . " " This lake 's deeper than three feet , Rheinhardt . " " Yes , " Rheinhardt said . " That 's true . " A wind came up from the fine green line of the St. Tammany shore and slid over the surface of the lake . " Shit , " Geraldine said . She strained her head upright to observe the water , her back flat against the rock . " Now I got it figured out . There 's a gigantic animal in there whose just about the same size as what the lake is . It ai n't shallowbut it looks it because it 's got this big bastard in it . In about a minute he 's gon na rear him up out there and shake himself and go stomp stomp and eat up the city of New Orleans . " " Great , " Rheinhardt said . " Wonderful . Leaf by leaf , bananastalk by banana stalk . Munching cathouses and spitting iron work . That 's my beast . Man , go ahead and eat the damn town . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't . It 's sick . It stinks . "  | " I like it because you were here , " she told him . Rheinhardt , kneeling on the flat rock , reached out and touched Geraldine 's calf . He felt as though someone had savagedhim in a particularly brutal and revolting way ; he had receivedher words like a cutting . It seemed to him that he could not rise from where he knelt or even push himself up on his arms . Even his hands felt stricken so he rubbed the tips of his fingers into the sharp , tiny spines of stone . " Did you know , " the man who was driving asked Morgan Rainey , " that nearly two hundred people live in the railroad yards ? " " Two hundred ? " Morgan Rainey said . " I never knew that . " " Well it 's true , " the man said . " Two hundred people go home to railroad property every night of the year . " They had left the freeway and were driving over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on miles of track , linked freight cars and deadheads stood motionless in the heat . Tinroofedsheds along the siding burned blindingly in the sun , turning back the sky 's fire . " I 've learned all sorts of things I never knew in this job , " the driver said . " Someday I 'm going to look in the mirror and I 'll have turned into a nigger . " He giggled and tried to catch Morgan Rainey 's eye in the rearview . Rainey was looking out at the tracking , fanning himself with his rainhat . At the Civic Center they had presented him with a cardboard portfolio full of colored questionnaires and with Matthew Arnold , in whose car and company he was proceeding to the field . Matthew Arnold was breaking him in , as they said . " What I really wanted , " Matthew Arnold said , " was a job with the Port of New Orleans Authority but I did n't have the residence requirement . I let them talk me into this survey and here I am . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ? " " I suppose they were . It is n't really civil service , you know.  |p149You  do n't get any civil service credits for it . Technically we work for a private research company . " " Yes , " Rainey said . " I know . " A group of negro children in dirty white undershirts were chasingeach other over a section of trunk line . At the far end of the line stood a cluster of three-story wooden structures with littered yards in front . Matthew Arnold parked and locked up his car . " You 've got to lock your car up like a vault , " he told Rainey . " I hate to do it in the hot weather , but otherwise they 'd pick me clean . " As they walked toward the nearest house , Arnold looked about cautiously and combed down the wings of his light , thinning hair . " To match this , " he told Rainey , " you 'd have to go to the black hole of Calcutta or a country very similar . You learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these houses I say to myself  --  questions and answers and that 's all . I do n't look at them . I do n't listen to their arrogance . I become absolutely im-pervious . " " Do you hate them , " Rainey asked . " I hate all niggers under forty , " Matthew Arnold said . " They 're spiteful . " " I suppose they are , " Morgan Rainey said . Matthew Arnold laughed . " You talk like you do n't know your niggers , Mr. Rainey . " The children who had been playing on the tracks gathered in the next yard and watched them . Rainey looked at them frowningand waved his rainhat . " I do n't , " he said . The children frowned back at him . " Well , you will shortly , " Matthew Arnold said . " It does n't take long . " They picked their way over a waste of kerosene drums and discardedcans to small crumbling porch . Bits of red waxcloth flutteredbefore drawn shutters in the front window . " Here we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch steps ; Matthew Arnoldp150tugged back the sleeves of his seersucker jacket and knocked at the door . There was no reply . " Somebody 's in there , " Arnold said , pressing an ear to the wood door . " I know it damn well . " He knocked again and they could hear a rustling of cloth and light steps across the floor inside . " You do n't have to say much , " Matthew Arnold assured Rainey . " Watch me . " The door opened and a dark young girl with straightened hair looked out at them . In the quarter minute of her opening the door , it seemed to Rainey that she had hardened her face into a mask of sodden density  --  her eyes seemed to film , her jaw fell slack , her features thickened . After the first instant 's yielding of the door , he had seen her pale eyes flash angry intelligence as she took them in . Now she stood in the open doorway blinking stupidlyin the terrible sun . " Are you Mrs. Hyppolite ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Oh . Is she at home ? " " No . No she ai n't . " " When do you think we might find her in ? " " I could n't say , " the girl told them . " No suh . " " This is still her place of residence is n't it ? " " Not as I know of , " the girl said . Matthew Arnold turned to Rainey ; the opening smile sagged in lifeless arrest on his pale face . " Now that 's damn strange , " he said . " I have the most detailedinstructions . " He set the cardboard case across a bent knee and began to rattle through it nervously . " And I have map . It comes with the daily key . Here it is . " He brought forth what appeared to be a blank sheet of paper and handed it to Rainey . There were some very faint blue lines at the bottom of the sheet and a small blue arrow at the bottom that pointed to nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy , " Rainey said.  | " No , " Matthew Arnold said sadly . " It 's the mimeograph machine . They do n't care , those people in the operations office . And we have to suffer for their negligence . " The girl in the doorway looked sympathetic . " But is n't this 11 Little Varrenes ? " Matthew Arnold asked unhappily . " Oh no sub , " the girl said . " Naw . Not this . " Matthew Arnold stepped back from the porch and turned to examine a small tin plate on the clapboard wall that stated , in incongruously tasteful Old French print , 11 Little Varrenes . " Wait a minute , " Matthew called grimly . " Just a moment . There 's a marker right on the door of your own house . How can this not be 11 Little Varrenes ? It obviously is 11 Little Varrenes . " You say i i Little Varrenes , " the girl asked . " Oh , i i Little Varrenes . This 11Little Varrenes right here . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residence of an individual by name of Mrs. Chester Hyppolite ? " " You say it ai n't her residence ? " " I 'm asking you if it is , " Matthew Arnold said grimly . " Is it ? " From somewhere inside the house , a man 's voice called " Yeah ! " " Let me put the question another way , " Matthew Arnold said slowly . " If welfare benefits were sent by mail to a Mrs. Chester Hyppolite at i i Little Varrenes , would she receive them at that address ? " " Would she receive them ? I 'd say she receive them , yessuh . " " And has she been receiving them here ? " " You all say you was from the welfare ? " " I guess we did n't explain that , did we ? " Matthew Arnold said amiably . " Yes we are from the welfare department . We 're not police or anything like that . All we 'd like to find out is whether or not Mrs. Hyppolite has been receiving benefits here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I been . " Matthew Arnold turned to Rainey in pale desperation . " But then you are Mrs. Hyppolite ? "  | " Tell him yeah ! " the man 's voice called . " Mrs. Hyppolite ? " the girl asked . " Girl , " Matthew Arnold said , " I 'm asking , are you Mrs. Hyppolite , or are you not ? " " Sure . " " Well , we certainly had a little difficulty with that , " Matthew Arnold said . " Do you suppose we might come in for a while ? We have a few very brief questions about your benefits . " " Somebody complain on me ? " " Why not that I know of . It 's all routine . A survey at ran-dom . " " You want to come in ? " They crossed the porch , stepping over soiled doll 's clothes , a discarded carriage wheel , a mud-encrusted , leering , rubber DonaldDuck . It was dark in the front room ; the shutters were tight against the sunlight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl told them , as Matthew Arnold spread his sheaf of forms across the table . " I do n't work by that name now . Maybe you ought a tell them peopleat the welfare that . " " What 's your name now ? " She said something that Morgan Rainey could not make out . " What 's that ? " Matthew Arnold asked . " Puckett ? P-U-C-K-E-T-T ? " " Yeah , " the girl said . " Like that . " " First name ? " " Wormwood . " " Wormwood ? Wormwood ? " Matthew Arnold asked . " WormwoodPuckett ? " " Is that for the star ? " Morgan Rainey asked suddenly , leaning forward . " For the star Wormwood ? " " Ai n't no star , " Wormwood Puckett said . " That 's my name . It 's Wormwood . " She turned unsteadily toward the back of the room . " That 's my name " she called into the doorless back room . " Ai n't it ? " " Yeah , " the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gentleman is ? " Matthew Arnold said stiffly . " Is he in residence here ? " Wormwood Puckett seated herself in the sofa opposite them and stared suddenly at Morgan Rainey , who was watching the hem of her houserobe rise as she settled onto the cushions . With measured innocence she looked from Rainey 's face to her own knees and back to Rainey 's face again . " You could sit down at the table too , " she told him hospitably . " You do n't got to stand . " " Thank you , " Morgan Rainey said , groping for the seat in a spasm of blushing confusion . " Thank you . " " Ub , the gentleman in the back , " Matthew Arnold inquired . " Who is he ? " " He 's asleep , " Wormwood Puckett said . " That may very well be , " Matthew said peevishly , " but who is he ? " " Y'all have to ask him that , I guess . " " Do you mean you do n't know who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him , " Wormwood Puckett said . " Ah , " Matthew Arnold said with an understanding smile . He turned to beckon Rainey forward , affecting to stifle a yawn . " Listen , " he whispered , glancing quickly back at Wormwood Puckett , who had begun to observe the progress of a water roach along a leg of the sofa . " I did n't get a chance to tell you before , but they wanted us to report it if we found any of these bucks hanging around as if they might be living with the women on the sly . Just for your reference . " " I see , " Morgan Rainey said . " Now , " Matthew Arnold said , smiling again , " Are you employed , Miss Puckett ? " " I do day 's work on an ' off . " " Did you work at all last week ? " " I done three days days work for a lady in Metairie last week . " " How much did you make ? " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much ? "  | " I could n't say . I think I made maybe three dollars for a day . " Matthew Arnold made the entries on his green form with a bored flourish . " I see it indicated that there are two young children domiciled here . ' Where are they now ? " " They with friends , " Wormwood Puckett told him . " With friends ? " " That 's right . They out visitin ' today . " " I 'm sorry we did n't get to see them , " Matthew Arnold said sadly . " We feel a little better when we can actually count heads . " " Uh huh , " Wormwood Puckett said . " Next time you all come we try to have their heads around so 's you can count them . There ai n't but two . " " Yes , please , " Matthew Arnold said . " Has your case worker been by this month ?

" " I mean I should think you 'd know where your butter and eggs come from . " " I get stuff from the store with these tags a white man bring me . Is that what your talkin ' about . " " That 's what I 'm talking about , " Matthew Arnold said , curlinghis large soft upper lip . " And that 's precisely the gentleman I mean . " " That 's the gentleman you mean ? " Wormwood Puckett asked , getting up from the sofa , " he the caseworker , huh ? " She looked from Matthew Arnold to Rainey . " Hey , " she called to the man in the back , " you know that littlegentleman that always bring the grocery tags so nice ? You know who he is ? " " You tell me who ? " the man in the back said.  | " He the caseworker . " " The caseworker , huh , " the man in the back said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair upsetting a stack of green forms , and tried to see round the partly open door to the back room . " Now that we know who the caseworker is , " he called , " let 's see if we ca n't find out who you are . Friendo , " he added hoarsely . They heard the shifting of the cloth , the creak of springs , as the unseen man raised himself . " Yessuh . My name John Smith , but the quality call . me Friendo and I do n't mind at all . " " All right , " Arnold said , " we 'll see what kind of a report comes out of this . " He and Rainey began to gather the papers quilted on the floor . " Maybe you think we get special pay to take this double-talk from you all . " " My Lord , " Wormwood Puckett said , " will you just look at that sky . Look at all them pretty clouds . " She was sitting on the couch again , her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the windows ; they were shuttered , the door closed fast . " It sure be a fine clay for a parade . " Morgan Rainey , who was on one knee and clutching a pile of the recovered green forms , looked at Arnold and saw him noddingexcitedly toward a pair of gallon wine bottles that stood open and wet-rimmed beside a cedar chest near the door . " It 's them birds I like , " the man in the back said pensively . " Look where they all flyin ' roun ' and roun ' up there . " " This is where we go , " Arnold said quietly . " There 's a special kind of report to go with cases like this . " " Hey , " Wormwood Puckett said from the sofa , " look there them two big white ones . . . " Matthew Arnold interrupted her hurriedly . " We 're leaving now , " he declared . " We 're terribly sorry if we 've inconvenienced you . Naturally you 'll be informed of any decisions about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wormwood Puckett said , following toward the door . " Bless you , bless you . Are you a caseworker too ? " she asked Matthew Arnold . " No , " Matthew Arnold said testily , stuffing the wadded forms back into his portfolio . " I 'm not a caseworker . " " How ' bout this gennulman with you ? Is he a caseworker ? " " No , no , " Morgan Rainey said , blushing again . " No . " " He do n't say much , does he ? He ai n't hardly open his mouththis whole time . " Morgan Rainey looked at her and passed through the door , Arnold behind him . Halfway down the porch steps , Arnold paused and turned on her . " He does n't say much because he 's quite highly placed and I 'm sure he 's noted everything that 's taken place here this morning . " He jumped quickly into the road and came abreast of Rainey . " I do n't understand it . I do n't know if it 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can do about it , do you think ? " Morgan Rainey asked him . " It 's just the situation . We just have to work through it . " " Do you think that it 's fair ? I-Iere , in spite of the situation , in spite of all this unnecessary bitterness , we 're trying to help out in the name of simple humanity , you see ? It seems to me that should call forth some appreciation even from people like this . " They walked on along the edge of the yards , skirting brown puddles and drying banks of gumbo mud beside the road . " And I always let myself get sucked into it . " " Yes . . . I realize . . . " Morgan Rainey said . " It 's hard to ... It 's hard ! " There was a stirring of shutters in every window as they walked to the car . By the time Morgan Rainey arrived at City Hall it was already hot , a windless , cloudless day ; the grass curled stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Elderly counselors shuffledp157up the long straight walks under black umbrellas suggestive of mortality ; arriving clerks walked without haste toward the great glass doors , fanning the still air before their faces with morning newspapers . The air-conditioners were on inside  --  so intensely that the outside edges of the lobby 's glass walls were rimmed with a film of frost . The steady drone of the coolers muffled the continued municipal rendition of " Stormy Weather . " The lean lady at the Service Operations desk wore her sweater . " Rainey , I 'm not giving you an area key this morning , " the lady told him . " I believe they have something special for you today . " She handed out a folder of colored forms , clipped to which was a note on the stationery of Mr. Claude Bourgois  --  AdministrativeAssistant . " Rainey  --  " it began , " we have reviewed your qualifications and background and feel that they entitle you to an area of your own . Go immediately to 2231 South Ney which is at the corner of Artesian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Contact Lester Clotho ( colored ) who is expecting you and can give you help in completing this area assignment . Lester gets on very well with us and we do not want for you to give him a hard time in any respect . Sincerely , Claude " Burgey " Bourgois . P.S. Mr. Arnold will be in this area during the day and will stop by the hotel to assist you with transport at twelve-thirty . " Rainey put the note in his pocket and took the Dryades bus to Artesian Street . He walked the three blocks of garage and wooden tenement to Ney and stood perspiring at the corner . In the three blocks , he had passed only one person  --  a shirtless man who lay , swollen face up , in a litter of orange peel and watermelonrind against the side of a cement building . He heard the laughter of unseen children from alleys and patios off the street . Ney Street seemed almost deserted , its shutters tight against the sun , but it was loud with radios . There seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlors.  |p158As  he started across to the hotel the street , with an almost imperceptible quickening of its pace , began to watch him . An aproned bootblack on the corner pushed back his soiled sailor 's hat and came out to stand beside his shed . A few young men in bright knit shirts came out of a grocery fingering their sunglasses . Rainey went past them and felt their gestures behind his back ; he turned slightly , thinking himself addressed , and saw one man performing an elaborate parody of guilty apprehension , dancing away , holding his hands as though they burned . The men standing in the doorways variously coughed , laughed or spat for the gutter . Rainey walked on , passing a store-front church ; the verse " Sufficient Unto the Day is the Evil Thereof " was lettered in red and gold across the window . " You know the man seen you do that , Roy , " one of the young men said . The Hotel Elite stood three stories high on the downtownlakesidecorner , displaying a blank drear face of shuttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightly painted image of a round faced Negro , whose smile extended nearly the length of the building . There was a cafe that seemed to be part of the hotel , and Rainey , after observing that he was being watched from every window on the far side of Ney Street , walked briskly inside . A bell with the sound of a small burglar alarm announced his entrance , the people at the bar were sitting motionless and silent , their backs toward him . From one of the back tables three welldressedmen in brightly banded straw hats looked at him without expression . The bartender stood still for a moment , frowned and came down the counter to Rainey . " Yessuh , " he said . " Can I help you ? " " Yes , " Morgan Rainey said . " Can you tell me where I might find Lester Clotho ? " The men at the bar seemed to relax and went back to their drinking . " Hey , Reese , " the bartender called to a woman who was workingthe grill , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spec he in the kitchen , " the woman said . " Right through there , mister , " the bartender said , pointing to a door at the end of the room . " You find him . " Morgan Rainey went through the door and walked straight into a heavyset white man in a dark blue suit , who was coming from the adjoining room . A rank rotting smell drifted through the door behind him . The white man looked at Rainey in surprise , backing off a step . " You lookin ' for Lester ? " " Yes , " Rainey said , " Lester Clotho , yes . " " Go on through . You 're just in time for lunch . " Shortening his breath , Rainey went in and saw three metal tables covered with rows of bloodied catfish . Two men in stained smocks were moving among the rows , slicing savagely at crusted gill and whisker with small grooved knives , their hands iced to the elbow with blood and slime . They worked quickly , parting the underscale in quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they flung into tin gut cans that were mounted on rollers at their feet . Humming softly , they went from row to row , kicking the mobile gut cans before them . Rainey stood and breathed the viscous air of the room . " Aha , Mr. Rainey , " someone said . At a point safely removed from the carnage , a plump and very dark man of distinguished bearing was seated in a red upholsteredchair . The man was holding an infant cradled in his arms , a tiny hairless child that seemed only weeks old , with large unfocusingmilky eyes and skin the color of light coffee . IIe stood up as Rainey approached , spreading the baby 's quilt across his shoulder and resting the child 's head there . He was wearing dark glasses , a tasteful madras tie and what appeared to be a white silk suit . Rainey took his soft ringed hand . " Mr. Clotho ? " " Mr. Rainey , welcome . " He settled the baby on the chair and smiled pleasantly . It was he whose picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told Rainey , looking at the fish . " They 'll smell so much better when they 're cooked in some nice cayenne pepper and thyme . My yes , they 'll smell so good then . You must be from the East , Mr. Rainey . " " No . In fact I 'm from right downstate . " " You looked overcome just now , sir . You ca n't be from downstateand be overcome by a mess of catfish . " " Oh , " Rainey said , " Not at all . Certainly not . " " Well we 've been pleasantly anticipating you at the Elite , Mr. Rainey . We 're always glad to see social service people . " " They told me I was supposed to contact you about the survey that 's underway . " " Yes indeed , " Mr. Clotho said . He walked back to the chair and flashed the rings on his fingers over the child 's face . " It ca n't see , " Rainey told him . " No , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rainey looked at him . " I thought that might be part of your field of training , " Clotho explained . " No , I 'm afraid I do n't even know any children . Is the baby yours ? " " This baby , " Mr. Clotho said , dangling his fingers over the child , " is the male offspring of a client . I may undertake his upbringing . And do you know , things being what they are , I think I may bring him up to be a girl . I believe I may . " Rainey saw that Mr. Clotho was still smiling . He had removedone of his rings and was rubbing it gently on the child 's forehead . Rainey watching him was suddenly reminded of the manner in which visitors at the zoo tapped against the wire cages of small animals . He put the thought from his mind . " Let 's adjourn to my office , " Mr. Clotho said . " We 'll talk there . Reese , " he called to the grill cook , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Reese answered . Mr. Clotho glided out between the fouled tables with both hands primly tugging at the spotless hem of his jacket . He camep161up behind one of the scalers and placed his hand in the air above the man 's shoulder . The scaler , a thin narrow-faced old man , did not look at him . " How now , my man , " Mr. Clotho asked pleasantly . " You goin ' to make those catfish whistle and dance ? " " Yeah , " the old man said . " They goin ' to stand up and salute are they ? " " Yeah , " the old man said . " That 's right . " " Oh ho ho , " laughed Mr. Clotho . " Yeah-man ! " he exclaimed merrily , burlesquing a minstrel routine . " 01 ' Clance was a pullmanporter in the old days . " He stood looking at Rainey for several moments , smiling . " Come , " he said , after a while . " We 'll go on upstairs . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where twenty or thirty bedsheets and colored spreads were drying on cruciform bars . Above them spiraled a complex of crumbling wooden balustrades and catwalks connected by green painted stairways and traps cut through the board walls . Looking up , Rainey saw a woman 's head , brightly peroxided , appear over a railing , beside it an angry pouting face masked with gray pancake makeup stared down at him and withdrew . Shrill excited voices echoed through the stairwells , but Rainey could not hear what they said . He followed Mr. Clotho inside again and up a flight of carpetedsteps that led to a glass paneled door on which was let-tered : Lester and Rudolph Insurance AgentsEmployment ServiceConfidential InvestigationsAbraham Lincoln Grand Old Party Republican Club Lester Clotho , ChairmanInside was a neat outer office with a wine-colored carpet on the floor ; behind a varnished railing a proper middle-aged lady in a flowered hat sat typing at an antique secretary . At a broadbackedbench in one corner of the room , an elderly man in ap162brown homburg was reading Ring magazine ; his left arm was encased in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Clotho announced as they past through the office , " this lady and this gentleman are members of my staff . Mr. Hughes , Mrs. Pruart  --  this is Mr. Rainey , representing our friends downtown . " The man waved his plaster cast , Mrs. Pruart smiled sweetly over her machine . " This morning has been just a procession of official guests , " Clotho said , pausing at the door of his office . " The gentleman you passed on your way in was from the police department . " " Oh ? " " Yes , indeed . The lieutenant is just a big old bear , is n't he , Mrs. Pruart ? " " Oh my yes , " Mrs. Pruart said . " Why do n't you handle our dealings with him from now on , Hughes ? " Clotho asked the man with the cast . " He gets me depressed . " " All right , " Mr. Hughes said , turning a page of Ring . They went into Mr. Clotho 's office . It was a bright sunlit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the intersection of Ney and Artesian . There were bookcases against the wall filled with old city directories and ledgers , and on the walls themselves were Audubon prints of aquatic birds . Mr. Clotho waited for Rainey to seat himself in a leather chair and settled himself behind his desk . " I 've been wondering , " Rainey said , " what they had in mind about your helping me with the survey . From what I 've seen up to now it looked pretty much like a simple business of questions and answers . " " Well I ca n't put myself in their place , can I , Mr. Rainey . But they always know what they 're about , I have faith in them . They have to have the information that guides them in regulating things and they have to send you all back here to collect it . I 'm sure what they 're worried about is your possibly falling in a hole , so to speak . "  | " A hole ? " Rainey asked . " Is it possible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embittered individual , Mr. Rainey ? Caucasians frequently arc in this mass of windy streets . I think when they refer you to me they want to guarantee your freedom of movement . " " Do they always do things this way ? " Mr. Clotho laughed exuberantly . " Oh ho ho , " he said , " you ask if they always do things that way ? Oh dear , pardon my laughter , sir  --  it 's certainly not at your expense  --  Why bless you , Mr. Rainey , that they do , sir . Yes , indeed . " " I see , " Rainey said . " Believe me , " Clotho said , " there are wrong turns a man can take . You 're not the first young man to come to us on one of these missions of mercy . Some do very well . But others take wrong turns . They fall in holes , as it were . " " I 've worked overseas , " Rainey said . " I 've worked with many sorts of people . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think they know what they 're doing downtown , Mr. Rainey ? " " I 'm in no position to question them . " " Who is ? " Mr. Clotho asked . " But you 're concerned are n't you Mr. Rainey ? I use the word concerned in sense of moral engagement . For example when you ask me a question like Do They Always Do Things That Way I think , I espy an uplifting reform-minded attitude . " He stood up , and walked to the window . " Now believe it or not , we 're not unacquainted with concern in this underdeveloped old part of town . Folks come to us concernedsometimes . If those folks could see what I can see  --  and what I have seen from this very window , they would be very carefulnot to let their concern blind them to certain pitfalls . " " Well , " Rainey said uneasily , " as I say I 'm not without experi-ence . " " My relations with your employers are mutually satisfactory , " Mr. Clotho said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . They want to see that purpose attained . They place their operatives under my close advisement to protecteveryone involved . And for my part I always find the responsibilityrewarding . I think I 'm going to find our relationship rewarding too , Mr. Rainey , because I 'm just fascinated by the kind of concern we 're talking about . " " Mr. Clotho , I suppose I can use all the help I can get on this and I 'll be glad to work with you . But as far as I can see I wo n't have the opportunity to concern myself with anything very basic . I mean I 'm only temporary after all . " Mr. Clotho smiled and smacked his lips . " Ah , you never know , Mr. Rainey . After all are n't we all only temporary ? " He put the question to Rainey with a little bow and assumed a sober expression . " Perhaps you 're heard the old refrain  --  let me see , does it escape me ?  --  If everyone lit just one candle  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle what a bright world this would be ! Do n't you blieve that , Mr.Rainey ? " Rainey looked into Mr. Clotho 's sunglasses and did not reply . " Let me see your key , " Clotho said , chuckling . " Just hand methe folder please . " Rainey placed his portfolio on Mr. Clotho 's desk ; Mr. Clotho opened it and looked quickly at the guide sheet . " Well , " he said , " they have n't lost their sense of timing . Do you know how to read your key , Mr. Rainey ? " " More or less . " Clotho handed back the portfolio . " You have to see a tenant of mine . She lives in the first house back of the hotel  --  you go down there past the clotheslines . Her name is Breaux . With an X. " " And do you come with me ? " " I 'll look in on you later , if that 's all right . I have a few calls . " " Certainly , " Rainey said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Clotho told him as he went out . Rainey left by the rear stairway . As we went down the boardp165steps , he heard a stifled shriek of laughter from one of the floors above and caught a momentary glimpse of the peroxided head . He did not look up . Beyond the clothesline was a small rank patio backed by a brick wall on which shards of jagged stone and upended broken bottles were jammed at intervals into the mortaring . The ground and the enclosing structures were grown with thorn and moss and incongruously fragrant honeysuckle . In the center , under a splintering arbor that bore withered vines of dead bougainvilleawas a small square building of lime brick . The door was open , rolling gently on a single broken hinge . A large green bath towel had been hung over the doorway . " Who 's that ? " a woman 's voice called out to Rainey . " Is that somebody ? " " It 's welfare , " Morgan Rainey said . " I 'm looking for Mrs. Breaux 's residence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinked at Rainey . Her hair was white , straight and combed close against her skull like a cap . Her mouth was open to a round 0 , her teeth parted . She appeared to breathe with difficulty , and her asthmatic expression gave her a look of incredulity . " You come for her ? " the woman asked Rainey . " I was supposed to interview Mrs. Breaux today , " Rainey said . " You see it 's part of a welfare survey . " " Survey ? " the woman asked . " A welfare survey . " " I guess you could survey , " the woman said . " That lady ca n't talk to you . " She held the toweling back so that Rainey could enter . " Sure enough I guess you could survey whatever you like . " There was a single candle burning near the door , but the room was otherwise dark . In the stream of sunlight that came through the doorway Rainey could see a large dresser , the top of which was crowded edge to edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spools of thread , glass buttons , clasps and brooches ,  |p166old  fashioned attaching collars of black lace . At the bottom panel of the tilting mirror stood a rank of tiny figurines  --  comic animals , toy soldiers , Christmas shepherds , a baby Jesus in a manger filled with shredded , dead leaves . Beside them were four Tarot cards face up and a stack of magazine patterns ; there was a pile of yellowing grammar-school copy books and children 's storiesin cardboard covers . The edges of the mirror were lined with penny holy pictures , twenty or more grave fading saints , their names spelled out in French in gothic print . At the top of the mirror , horned and regal , High John the Conqueror stretched forth his mace and just below him were pasted several photographs of a young Negro , rouged and pink-lipped with cheap retouching . There was one of him in fancy dress standing beside a slightly cross-eyed light-skinned girl in a wedding frock . In the middle of the dresser , a large plaster madonna looked down , in formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who had been holding the candle set it down on the dresser so that Rainey could see the rest of the house . There was only the one room . The dresser and two clothcoveredchairs together with the bed in which the old lady lay , were the only furnishings . Mrs. Breaux was a small brown woman . The skin was stretched drum tight over the bones of her face and her small hooked , bird-like nose . Her lids fluttered over empty eyes ; she was breathing noisily in small desperate sucks that drew her lips inward with each breath . " You ai n't come for her then ? " the woman at the bedside asked . " No , " Morgan Rainey said . " I came for a . . . survey . " " Uh huh , " the woman said . " I 'll come back when she 's feeling better . " The woman looked at him with her incredulous expression and seemed to laugh . Rainey looked away from her and bent over Mrs. Breaux 's bed . Mrs. Breaux 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mouth raised to seek the air . All the soft parts of herp167face had collapsed and looked dark gray in the candlelight ; her forehead and temples , the wrinkles under her chin , had all turned the same color , lifeless metallic gray . Of course , she was dying , Rainey saw . The gray skin  --  sick nigger , dying nigger , he had been told about that as a boy . He had associated it with sick white elephants . He watched the woman 's eyes flutter in the candlelight , her gray dying lips pucker in quick spasms . " Is you come ? " the dying woman asked . Her eyes were blank under the trembling lids . " No , no , " Morgan Rainey said . " No . It 's all right . " " Maybe I could ask you , " the sitting-in woman said . " What they gon na do ? They gon na take her away ? ' Cause I think by now there ai n't no sense to that ' cause she soon gone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what it was . Doctor come in once and he give her a needle . He tol ' another lady she was dyin ' and to call her family . He say call the Charity if she in pain but ai n't nobody come back since then . " " I do n't know what they 'll do then , " Rainey said . " It was something else I came about . " " I ca n't help you with nothin ' else , " the woman said . " Is you come ? " the woman on the bed whispered . " You come ? " Rainey put his hand across her forehead , it was hot and dry as sand . " Yes , " he said . " Yes . " " You come , ' ti f rere ? You come now ? " " Right here , " Rainey said . " What are you tellin ' her , man , " the sitting-in woman said suddenly . " How you know what she talkin ' about ? " " Ah he die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " ... a fine fat fella come back from the war . Who a knowed it . . . ah mon fil . . . all healthy and died . " " Her son she talkin ' about , " the other woman said , clasping her hands , " that one 's in the picture there . "  | " You come , bon dieu ? " the old woman asked . " Coming , " Morgan Rainey said . " You pardon me , " said the sitting-in woman , " I do n't see why you want to come talkie ' round her when she dyin ' . If'n you ca n't help her . " " What do you think ? " Rainey asked her . " Can we get her anything ? Does she want a priest or something ? " " We sit with her when we can . Always be somebody here till it 's over . Still she alone . " The woman looked at Rainey and shook her head . " You all did n't have no help for her before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sorry , " Rainey said . " She had a house . Had a nice house . Man run her out , I do n't know why . She alone . " " Oh , " Rainey said . " Here they 's rats , " the woman said , pointing to the patio . " Thick together like red beans . Rats , " she repeated , nodding at Rainey . " Think they wo n't bite you ? " Rainey pulled one of the chairs to Mrs. Breaux 's bedside and sat with his hand on her forehead watching the quilt rise and fall with her breathing . When he looked up , Mr. Clotho was in the doorway . The sitting-in woman reached over took the candle from the dresser , holding it with both hands . Mr. Clotho came in and looked at Rainey 's hand , which rested on Mrs. Breaux 's forehead . " Oh , " Mr. Clotho said . " You 're nice . " Rainey stood up , looking at the floor . " This was hardly the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guided him out past the green toweling to the yard . " Why it 's just one of those administrative oversights , " Mr. Clotho told him comfortingly . " You ca n't blame an apparatus for its lack of delicacy . " " I 'll have to ask them what they want done . " " We 'll take care of the lady , Mr. Rainey . "  | " I see , " Rainey said . " Certainly . Why you 've already served above and beyond the call  --  sitting in there so kindly with poor Mrs. Breaux . I 'm really impressed . That was concern , Mr. Rainey , that 's what that was . " They went back past the clotheslines and into the small pink hallway that served as a lobby for the hotel . " You did n't tell me she was ill , Mr. Clotho . Why did n't you ? " " Mr. Rainey , " Clotho said , " you have nothing to be ashamed of . You 're just ill at ease and I do n't blame you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ease too . What kind of data are you going to file on Mrs. Breaux ? " " I do n't know , " Rainey said . " I could n't interview her . " " Do n't worry , " Clotho told him . " Write that one off to learningthe ropes . You 'll surely get yourself organized in a little while . " Clotho smiled sadly and started up the front stairs toward his office . " Everybody has to serve within the limits of their capacities . " He pointed his finger significantly at Rainey 's chest as he mounted the steps . " Everybody has to aspire toward concern . " Rainey watched him go through the office door and close it gently behind him . Late in the afternoon , Rheinhardt and Geraldine made a stewpot full of gin fizz and lay down to drink on the shady side of the balcony . Rheinhardt read poetry aloud at great length from a paperback anthology . After his fourth gin fizz , he read nearly all of the " Wreck of the Deutschland . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick , and loudly enough to be heard on the far side of the street . " Let him be Easter in us , " Rheinhardt recited fervently , " be a dayspring to the dimness of us . ..

Rheinhardtshrugged . " Easter in us . " He dipped his glass in the pot for another . " I was looking in here , " Geraldine said , handing him the book . " Here 's what I liked when I saw it . Read it once . " She held her thumb to the box of small print beside the tenth stanza of Part IV of the " Ancient Mariner . " Rheinhardt read it for her .

" Sorry . " " Yeah , " Rheinhardt said . He was still smiling , thinking of Geraldine . " Sure . " Rainey paused on the landing and removed his rainhat . " Uh  --  Are n't you on the radio ? " he asked Rheinhardt . " Sometimes I work for the radio . " " That 's an interesting station , that VV . . . whatever it is . " " It is an interesting station . " Geraldine came to the door and looked at Rainey with drunken , goodnatured curiosity . " Say , " she asked him brightly , " do you really work at the morgue . " " The morgue ? " Rainey asked . " Why no , I do n't work at the morgue . " Of course not , " Rheinhardt said . " No , " Rainey said . " I 'm working on a welfare survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your station , Mr. . . . " " Rheinhardt , " Rheinhardt said . " I heard you introduce a program on relief and welfare in the state . I guess it was last week . I thought that program was pretty . . . " he smiled and waved his hand uncertainly . " It was pretty bad , " Rheinhardt said . " It was pretty . . . vituperative . " " That 's how it is down there , " Rheinhardt told him . A thick red liquid was leaking through Rainey 's paper bag , fallingto the wood floor in syrupy drops . " I have strawberry ice cream , " Rainey said apologetically , " I really have to get home . " He put his hand under the bag and caught a drop in his open palm . " Uh  --  would you all like some ? " he asked . " I 'd love some , " Geraldine said . " I really would . " " Thanks , " Rheinhardt said . " You can put it on our ice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite bare and nearly without ornament . Rainey mumbled something about it 's being very nice . He had bought the ice cream on a cheerful impulse but his day had been a bad one . There had been a syphilitic middle-aged woman and a freckled idiot child . One of the child 's fingers was gangrenous because his sister had tied a piece of string around it . " We keep it pretty clean , " Rheinhardt agreed . They sat down on the balcony . In the kitchen , Geraldine , weaving slightly , sliced up half of the ice cream . Rheinhardt refilled his gin fizz glass and looked at Rainey with his expression of Polite Interest . " I 'm afraid I 'm on the other side of the line from you all , " Rainey confessed to Rheinhardt when the ice cream was out . " I 'm no radical but I 've been involved in service work and I guess I just picked up a different view of things . " " Oh , " Rheinhardt said . " You wo n't throw me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why not ? " Rheinhardt asked . Geraldine laughed . " Do n't put the man on , Rheinhardt . He do n't believe a word of what 's on that station , " she told Rainey . " Not even the news . " Rheinhardt looked at her sharply . " You do n't believe it ? " Rainey asked smiling . " Why I think that 's just fantastic . I mean between the music that station is just all radical-right message . You must be up to your nose in their politics  --  and yet you do n't believe in it ? " " Belief is a very subtle and delicate thing , " Rheinhardt said . Rainey laughed uneasily . " I do n't understand how . . . " He stopped and looked curiouslyat Rheinhardt . Rheinhardt did not smile . " I guess I 'm not minding my own business , " Rainey said . Rheinhardt set his glass down beside the stewpot.  | " That 's all right . " " It was just that I happened to hear that business on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What do you do ? " Geraldine asked him . " Well . . . I collect data . I ask questions . " He looked from Geraldine to Rheinhardt and narrowed his eyes , smiling weakly . " It 's really very strange . " " Why ? " Rheinhardt asked . " Well , " Rainey said , " maybe I just find it strange . " He spread his palms upward before him and looked down into them . " You know . . . when you go into a neighborhood there are  --  well , there are always interrelationships and attitudes that you do n't know anything about . Because you 're an outsider . I work with Negroes . " " You like working with them ? " Geraldine asked . " Yes , " Rainey said . " I think I do . But all these almost ritual attitudes , you know  --  it 's hard . " " Do you go back there at night ? " Rheinhardt asked him . " I have n't yet . I have n't had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job a couple of weeks . " " Oh , " Rheinhardt said . Rainey was looking at him expectantly . " Why did you ask that ? " " Because you 're telling me what you do , " Rheinhardt said , " and I want to help you tell me by making a picture , dig ? When I make a picture I have to know whether it 's nighttime or daytime . In the picture . " " Daytime , " Rainey said . " Hot daytime . " " You get on with those folks ? " Geraldine asked . " I do n't know  --  I mean you ca n't expect much . It 's an old slum . You walk on very old ground . It 's got its own rules . It 's got its own ghosts . " " Well , you 're from down here , " Rheinhardt said . " You 're supposed to know about rules and ghosts . " Rainey looked down at his hands again . " Half the time I guess I 'm going into situations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on  --  deals with authority , deals between all the great and small powers that run things over there . Lots of things I do n't know anything about happen all around me . " " Yeah , " Rheinhardt said . " I know what you mean . " " It makes me feel helpless a lot of the time , you know . But I 'm going to learn my way around . " He looked from his hands to the still street below the balcony where they sat . " It 's been hot , you know . It seems hotter back there . In the middle of the day  --  the sun  --  I have trouble with my eyes , " he declared . " You  --  uh  --  you do n't do this just for the money , do you ? " Rheinhardt asked . " Of course he do n't , " Geraldine said . She was sitting with her back against the balcony divider , looking quite wasted . " Well no , " Rainey said . " I had a feeling you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and felt a quickeningof anxiety . We are in the presence of sacrifice , he thought . Sacrifice always means blood . " I did n't think you were in it for the money , " Rheinhardt told him . " I thought when I saw you with your bag of ice cream that we were in the presence of virtue . " Rainey stood up frowning and turned stiffly away . " I did n't mean to invite myself in , " he told them . " Aw no , " Geraldine said . " I apologize , " Rheinhardt said . " I was being facetious to show off to my girl there . " Rainey nodded to Geraldine and went inside , his lips pursed . " I really wish you well , " Rheinhardt said , walking after him . " I think you 're riding a bad scene back there . " It was bad luck to have him in the same building . He was haunted . " Tell me , " Rheinhardt asked , as they walked through the livingroom , " do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tilted his head slightly to one side . " Yes , " he said . " Do you ? "  | " Sure , " Rheinhardt said . " I read it . " He went to the refrigeratorand brought out the remainder of Rainey 's ice cream . " I read it for the theory . " " Listen , buddy , " Geraldine called from the balcony , " do n't let old Rheinhardt get you down . " " You . . . you work with these spades because you 're trying to prove something to yourself , right . I mean it 's like therapy , right ? " " I really thought , " Rainey said , " that you were against people asking questions . " " Sure . " " I want to find out about humanness , " Rainey said . " What it is . Where mine is at and how I can keep it there when I find out . " " So , " Rheinhardt said . " I 'd like to find out what 's the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are n't any people . " " Very subtle , " Rheinhardt said . " Very admirable . " " Very necessary , " Rainey said . He let Rainey out on to the patio stairs and walked back to the pot of gin fizz . " All right , " he asked himself . " Who 's got the Easter ? " Rainey went upstairs and put the remainder of his ice cream in the refrigerator . Then he lay down on the bed and considered the malice which had been directed at him downstairs . He raised his left hand and examined its pale skin and veins  --  the word repugnant came to his mind . He had become repugnant . In order to opt for life , as he had resolved , he would have to accept his repugnance along with everything else . It was a dangerous acceptance however ; it lent itself to unhealthy speculations , to a grandiose embitterment that might undo him . Somewhere in the course of things , he had lost whatever elementswere necessary to human contact . It was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he had become , as a doctor once informed him , a natural accuser . Rainey thought of the doctor and recalled the soiled snow of Dorchester . He had walked it as an investigator for the MassachusettsChildren 's Bureau . That year he had lived in a third-story room in a wooden house on the edge of Cambridge . That year he had collected razor strops and lengths of horsewhipand nail-ended slats . He had released infants from chain nooses and inspected the burns that radiators made . One night he had awakened with the impression that a child 's eyes had been put out in his room . The doctor was a bald young man with a reputation for politicalinvolvement . " You have a very original idea of morality , " said the doctor . Rainey stood up and walked to his balcony , trying to put the doctor 's dry voice from his mind . He began to hum a song called " Los Chimichimitos . " It was a Venezuelan children 's song . In Puerto Moreno he lived in a bungalow on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was an asphalt quarry on the bank of a brown river . The cliff was the dead-end of his barrios ' highest street ; there was a wire fence at the cliff 's edge that Rainey had built together with a mulatto named Rodriguez . They had built it so that no more children would fall . The children played by the muddy open sewers that ran filth in putrid waterfalls down the slopes and they sang " Los Chimi-chimitos . " Rainey drummed on the balcony rail and smiled to himself . ( Que baile la viaja tam-boure '  --  Que baile el viajito tamboure ' . ) Once he had organized a basketball team from among the barriochildren and he had gotten the oil company to let them use the gym in the Company Model Village . He was not well liked by the oil company people either , he thought proudly . One night Rainey 's team played the Model Village boys andp177beat them ; his players were plantain fed twelve year olds , half of whom slept on their shoeshine boxes in the city . Rainey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back of a company transport . The boys boasted and whistled and replayed their shots as the truck bounced up the snaking , rutted road . With every outrageous turn of the mountainside , the lights of the quarries and the company towns below them grew smaller . They sang and looked down on the lower world with scorn . Ai , pobrecitos , Rainey thought . Humanness . He was alive then . Varus , he thought , give me back my basketball team . Life , life . He would not let it go . Early in the morning , before ten , Geraldine got up and went to shop at Schweggman 's on the Frenchman Street bus . Rheinhardtlay in bed drifting in and out of dreams . Hot , disquieting sunlight came into his eyes through the colored oilcloth over the rear window ; he would awaken for a moment , turn , and within seconds fall back into a throbbing coma that carried his mind out of waking focus . He had , in the last months , become quite aware of this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was what the committed juiceheads meant when they talked about the " picture show . " It complicated the business of mornings , but there was no proper way out of it except to run the gauntlet of trips to whatever was on the other side . In the early stages at least , this was dependably the day at hand . The last dream went on in some littered darkness , a dim loftlikeplace  --  he was pressed into a glass booth the size of a coffin from which he could see a floor of worn wooden planks that was strewn with burned charcoal and wrapping paper . There were piles of coal and heaps of green sticks , rusted nails upright  --  and stretching into the darkness , rows of dusty glass display cases where shapeless artifacts lay covered with mold . He was conscious of a noise in the place  --  not in the booth , because , ofp178course , the booth was soundproofed  --  but beyond , in the dimnessroared some terrible noise just out of hearing ; he could feel the noise against the glass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the booth , but it was always higher than his head ; he sank down , bending his knees to look at the planks of the floor , and saw small bright-eyed animals with furred parabolic ears rising from their heads , who came forward in darts and rushes to peer in at him and press bared teeth and quivering nostrilsagainst the glass walls . Cavies , he thought , they were called cavies . While he watched them , in the dark place beyond , there appearedtwo , then three white lights like the glare of welders ' torches ; they flickered and burst to light the dim loft like a sheet of summer lightning . The place exploded into light and around the booth grew great stalks of bright green plants and the presence of hundreds of wings flapping together  --  the glass cracked liked yielding ice and for a part of a second the outside noise howled in his ears like a radio turned by mistake to full volume . Then the vegetation boiled up around him and the fluttering of wings rose and died away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was light , actually light with the light of day ; he could see a long white plain stretching beneath him and hear chords  --  F , C , G , repeated at soft intervals F , C , G. He was awake , jammed against the wall beside his bed ; the ghost of the winged sound was fluttering with his eyelids . In one of the near apartments someone was playing chords on a guitar  --  F , C , G.He got out of bed and went into the hot bright kitchen to look for the bourbon bottle : There was only a finger or two in the bottle ; he poured it into a water glass and filled the drink with cold orange juice from the refrigerator . When he opened the shutters to the balcony the breeze he had expected was not there . The street below was empty and seemingly wet with rain , but the sun was high at afternoon , there was no wind . He stood looking at the street , listening to the drone of flies and the clip-clop of a horse-drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flushed with the bourbon , his heart beat alarmingly fast ,  |p179his  breathing quick and shallow . He was sweating . He could close his eyes and see the white light . He went inside again , turned on the air-conditioner and sat down to finish the bourbon and orange juice . The way , he thought , has become lined with all manner of things . With a sudden chill , he remembered the place in the dream and took a long sip of his drink . Wingdale . By God , he thought , they are running me off the map ; there was just hardly any margin at all . He had practiced for so long at staying out of the bad places that he approached even nights with a kind of confidence . But now he was finding himself in places far worse than the ones he avoided with such skilled calculation . " The way . . . is getting lined , " he said aloud , and rubbed his sweating palm along the cool glass . In another apartment the man with the guitar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lined and you can end up all sorts of places . Bad place the corners of the night , the roughest neighborhoods of all . Very shortly , he told himself , you will belong to pathology . Nights betrayed him . He could get into bed with the girl , lose himself in the turns of her body , in the sweet gaming that was the only rest of his time in bed , in soothing and bringing her along ( she was very tender  --  it seemed always at the threshold she would draw back thinking to be hurt and sigh with wonder when it went well ) , taking her once or twice , and then , almost always for a while , he would sleep . But in time , and he was never sure how much , he would be awake again and there would be nothing to do but lie back and hold on , letting the show start . It had happened to him many times before , of course , on the road , or when he had not been able to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk he was . They were not visions , or Shakespearean portends or anything personal or particular to him ; he knew quite well that there were names for them all  --  The Picture Show , the Whirlies , the White Light . It was not undiscovered country , it was  --  pathology.  |p180First  the pictures would come to the dark of his eyes , in quick flashes without continuity . Then they would begin to hang togetherand take directions ; he followed streets that ended suddenly in empty white cities  --  skeletons of Rio or Montevideo or Beirut that he had seen . Or sometimes the color would be quite different ; he would trip through the dark varnished wooden rooms of his grandparents ' house . There would be sounds  --  passage practice repeated over and over or wind in his ears or the breathless soprano droning of children at their prayers . ( At St. Walburga 's Parochial School in Mountain Home he would drift off in class while from the separate girls ' classrooms would come the interminable half chant of the after lunchtime rosary , the quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singsong response , over and over  --  Blessed is the fruit of Thywombjesus ; he would sit dreaming , count it out in stops , make notes of it . ) Often he might follow some quiet specter of recollection to see it whirl suddenly , unmask itself , fix him with a cold kiss and leave him betrayed in some unutterable place  --  the soft fibers of his mind to be keelhauled over the strange and wondrous , poison-spined creature on the underside of nights . . . ( whateverscene there was , was suddenly bright with iridescence and the white lights , his jaw fighting to lock ; his hands and fingers turning inward , uncontrollable ; his legs struggling in fits to stretch themselves over folds of hot wet rubber . . . and the thing then would be to fight up out of bed and smoke a cigarette unless the rhythm of match and smoke and lip proved too complexand he would fall into a chair or back to the bed and drift out along another track to pass the night sleepwalking in a pyramidfrom one rotting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up  --  he was yelling Geraldine said  --  and he had gone all the way to the balcony to light that cigarette , had seen the iron work across the way glow with white light and crowds of shimmering shadow people in the street below calling Now Watch Him Fall ; he had stood shivering inp181night-cold sweat until the match burned his fingers and she came out to help him in . I could be bound in a nutshell , Rheinhardt thought , carefully lighting a cigarette , but the way is getting lined . In small hotels near the bus station , solitary men burned themselves up in motheatenarmchairs . Defend me friends , I am but hurt . He finished the drink , showered and dressed . For a while he stood before the bathroom mirror and tried to see the tic in his eye where the lid was convulsing . In another month he would be thirty . Too soon , he thought . But too soon for what ? In the middle of the journey of our life , he recited silently , I found myself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the straight path . He stretched his hand before him and saw the long yellowedfingers rise on invisible wires ; his eyelid marked it in onetwotime , faintly suggesting angel feathers . The forests of the night . Yes , indeed , Rheinhardt thought ; he felt the wings again . The thought of which renews my fear . Wingdale . He went out on the patio stairs , breathing without satisfaction the heavy plant-scented air . The Pastoral was on in Bogdanovich'sapartment . " What was it you think we did to you ? " she had written him . She had sent him a picture of them with her address on it ; he was supposed to carry it in case he dropped dead . The letter containing it was returned from Chicago . She thought she was pregnant by a married man , she was going to have an abortion . " You could have gone ahead and killed yourself and us and it would have been almost the same . I lived for you , I swear , that was the way it was with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stars . ) He started down , clenching one hand in his trouser pocket , the other tight on the stair rail . One flight down , he came upon a bearded man in blue farmer 's coveralls who was lying across the landing , balanced on an elbow . The man looked up at him with bright madman 's eyes.  | " Man , " he said as Rheinhardt started for the lower story , " how you makin ' it , man ? " " Good , " Rheinhardt said . " How you makin ' it ? " The man laughed a mock Negro laugh and ground his strangely white front teeth together . " Bad , " he said , " bad news makin ' it . You have a cigarette ? " The door of Bogdanovich 's opened and a girl came out to them . She was about twenty-five , dark and slim with small black eyes and a pale long face ; she reminded Rheinhardt for all the world of a homosexual yeoman who had once propositioned him at the Anacostia Naval Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she told the bearded man . Rheinhardt looked at her . She was wearing a khaki officer 's shirt and trousers with brown sandals . " I 've got some , " Rheinhardt said . " Do you want one too ? " Marvin took a cigarette and laughed his Negro laugh again , baring his teeth at the girl . He looked at them and saw that all  --  Bogdanovich , the girl , Mad Marvin were displaying what dear Natasha liked to call Philosopher'sEye ; they were teaheads and they were quietly blasted . He felt a sudden rush of affection for them on Natasha 's account . " What was your scene ? " Bogdanovich asked him softly . " Oh , well . . . " Rheinhardt said . " New York . " " Of course , " Bogdanovich said , with the manner of one whohad graciously turned a compliment . Rheinhardt bowed . " Tell me , " he asked them , " did you know Natasha Kaplan ? " " Of course , " Bogdanovich said . " Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , truly , man , did you know my Natasha ? " " Why not ? " Marvin asked . Everyone looked thoughtful . " She 's in Wingdale , " Rheinhardt told them . " Ah , " they said , and nodded approvingly . " You were in Wingdale , Marvin , " the dark girl asked , " did you know her ? "  | " When I was in Wingdale , " Marvin said , " Listen  --  when I was in Wingdale  --  " he closed his eyes and moved his head from side to side . " There was nothing . . . there was nothing  --  that I knew ! " Everyone nodded again . " But in the mountains  --  in the mountains , man  --  I knew all of it . " " Yes , " Bogdanovich said . " Truly , " Marvin said . " Believe it . " " Of course , " Bogdanovich said . Marvin looked from face to face and stopped at Rheinhardt . " Man , " he said , " that was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No ogla bee . No gasoline-smell greasetraptaco stand plastic supermarket shit . No fatwoman drive-ins . No polite killer cops . No oregano salesmen . No Northbeach . No Southbeach . No Beach Beach . It was n't like that , man  --  you think it was ? " " No , " Rheinhardt said . " It could n't have been . " " It could n't have been , " Marvin said soberly . " It could not have been . And it was not . " " It was a California of the mind , " the girl said . " My God , " Bogdanovich said stepping forward in wide-eyed astonishment , " what a California that would be ! " As they watched , he raised his hands to describe a box and held them palms facing palm . " Look , " he told them , " that 's your mind , dig ? And here it 's all gray , it 's all nowhere , it 's just dry and barren and terrible trips . But here , dig  --  at the Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . And there 's blue and purple islands and high cold mountains and forests with a carpet of pine needles . And orange juice in the clear desert . " " And orange juice in the desert ! " the dark girl sighed . She put a hand to her mouth and moaned with longing . " At that place , man . At the end of that dry hairiness , on the other side of the skeletons and the windies and the terrible salt flats , at the further edge of the bad trips  --  that 's the California of the mind . Suddenly you find it there ! "  | " Yeah , " Marvin said . " Tell more . Tell more ! " " Well , man , there 's nothin ' but miles of it ocean and prairie and rangeland and all of San Francisco and fair L.A.  --  all in the mind . And canyon creeks with trout and Herefords and velvety green hills of the mind , green and sweet smelling . " " Yeah , " Marvin said . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And abalones of the mind . And glider contests of the mind . " " Motorcycles of the mind . Chinatowns of the mind . " " And Chinamen of the mind . " " And wine of the mind , " Rheinhardt said . " Oh , shit yes , man ! " Marvin said ecstatically , " and wine of the mind . " " Oaklands of the mind . " " And Watsonvilles of the mind . " " And cliffs and seals and sulfur baths of the mind . At the western end of your mind , man . All of it , man . " " And beautiful people , " Marvin said . " Beautiful people , " the dark girl said , sighing again with longing . " Yes , " Bogdanovich said . " We had raccoons , " Marvin said . " At night  --  raccoons . " " Raccoons of the mind , " Rheinhardt said idly . " Fuck that , " the girl said . " Yeah , " Marvin said . " Raccoons are groovy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , " the girl said , shuddering now and moaning with revulsion , " the dirty raccoons of the mind . " " That 's the worst kind of raccoons there are , " Bogdanovich told them with a scholarly air . " The ravagey little raccoons of the mind . " " Are they in the mind 's California ? " the girl asked fearfully . " No , " Bogdanovich said , " the raccoons are actual raccoons . " " Thank God , " the girl said . Rheinhardt closed his eyes and saw the furry creatures of thep185night before  --  cavies of the mind . " How did you get down here ? " he asked Bogdanovich . " Who knows ? " Bogdanovich said . " How ? " Marvin said . " Why does anyone come to California , man . The sea , the sky , the air , man ! " " This is n't California , Marv , " the girl said gently . " This is Louisiana here . " Marvin started to his feet in alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Holy shit , man , that ai n't no place to be ! We got ta get out of here . " " Louisiana is where New Orleans is , man , " the girl explained . " There 's no way around it , actually . California was another time . " " That 's right , " Marvin agreed . " That 's what it 's all about , right ? " " Right , " the girl said . " Say , " Rheinhardt said after a moment , " where can a man score around here ? " " Score what ? " Bogdanovich asked him . " Score what ? " the girl said in a small voice . " Yeah , " Marvin said , " what is that  --  score ? " They looked at him angrily . " Everything 's cool , " Rheinhardt said . " I 'm not fuzz or anything . I 'm just looking to score a lid . " " We do n't know too much about that , " Bogdanovich said . " Next to nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How come you always say that lately  --  next to nothing  --  what kind of a groove is that ? " " Well , I do n't know , " Bogdanovich said , turning away from Rheinhardt , " it 's something people say . It sort of makes a picture . " " It sure does , " Marvin said . " Like there 's her and there 's you and there 's me and there 's nothing . So I 'm next to nothing . " " That 's what I 'm trying to convey , dig ? " " I 'm always next to nothing , " Marvin said . " Nothing is with me night and day . "  | " Marvin is an outsider , " Bogdanovich explained . " I see , " Rheinhardt said . " Well I 'll see you all later . " " Where are you off to ? " Bogdanovich asked him . " I thought I 'd take a walk around . " " I 'm going to the laundry . You want to walk me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the girl to listen to the Pastoral again and went out into the street . There were people out now , walkingup from the bus stop at the French Market . The late afternoonfruit vendors pushed their carts before them calling their buyers with cries that were part Sicilian patois and part field holler . " Trawberries . . . tutti cuarn ' . " They bought a bag each from an old man with dyed sideburns . " Thanks , dad , " Bogdanovich told him . Chewing the huge sweet berries , wiping the rich juice from their mouths , they walked to Decatur Street . " Oh , man , " Bogdanovich said . " Strawberries . " Down at the levee the longshoremen were changing shifts , the bars and wine barrel rooms were full . Passing the Harbor Bar they saw a small fat Cuban bring his fist down on the glass toppingof a pinball machine and look with triumphant malice at the shattered glass and the streaks of blood on his arm . " Chingo su madre , " he said . Groans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel house at the corner of St. Philip was playing " Walk Do n't Run . " Bogdanovich took a running step across the sidewalk , and whirled to face Rheinhardt  --  fierce-eyed and brandishing the strawberry bag . " Chingo su madre , " he said snarling . And he smiled . " I wish I could do that . " " Your mother ? " Rheinhardt asked cautiously . " Oh , no no no man , " Bogdanovich said . " My mother ! My poor old mother ! No , I mean I wish I could take on the world and say  --  Chingo su madre ! " " I wish I could too , " Rheinhardt said.  | " But if I did the world would say  --  What ? The world would say WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT MY MOTHER ? " " Then you would have had it , " Rheinhardt agreed . " The world would shake and crack and open up and down I 'd go , man , and the world would say  --  THAT 'S FOR WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT MY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us all , " Rheinhardt said . " Conscience do n't make no coward of Marvin , " Bogdanovich said as they turned on to Elysian Fields . " He never learned fear . But he pays , man , he pays all the time . " " He looks it . " " Yeah they 're always taking poor angel Marvin away . When they do n't find him , he goes out looking for them . " They followed the dun squares of Elysian Fields for several blocks until they came to a line of wooden stores surrounded by the dry stalks of dead banana trees . Bogdanovich opened a door marked Laundrymatic Inc . " My employers , " he told Rheinhardt . At the far end of a row of dryers a sad-faced young man with a crew haircut was waiting for them . " Hey , there 's some shit in this here number ten dryer , " the young man declared . " Shit ? " Bogdanovich asked him . " Some damn sneak put a rug in here or somethin ' . I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get here with the service truck you gon na have to clean it out yourself . " " All right , " Bogdanovich said . " I wo n't mind that . " " Who 's this ? " the young man said , nodding toward Rheinhardt . " He 's my buddy , " Bogdanovich said . " His name is Buddy . He 's an efficiency expert . " " How do you do ? " the young man asked . " How do you do , " Rheinhardt told him . " OK then , " the young man said . " You could turn the coolers on later if you feel like it . I 'll see you tomorrow . "  |p188When  he was outside , Bogdanovich locked the street door behind him . " He 's such a scene , that guy . I could talk to him for hours . As a launderer , he 's one of the best in the business . " " What do you do ? " Rheinhardt asked him . " Well , the modern launderer does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to have executive capability . And above all , he needs a sure insight into human nature  --  because laundry is a public service profession . " " Certainly , " Rheinhardt said . They left the machines and went into a bare room lined with shelves on which stood boxes of soap , bottles of bleach and disinfectant . " You never have to buy soap in this business , " Bogdanovich said , laying out a thin line of marijuana across a piece of zig-zag paper . " That 's another thing about it . " He lit the joint , breathed his toke and passed it to Rheinhardt . Rheinhardt inhaled and held his breath . " A service profession , " Bogdanovich went on , " in many subtle ways . For example , laundry is always dirty . People laundry is always all dirty and shit stained and foul  --  on a cumulative basis , man , it 's just staggering . People always want to sort of sneak it into the machine , like they wrap their real organic laundryup in clean towels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So it 's a little like being a maitre d ' . Unobtrusiveness . You observe only what it is required to observe . You serve the public by assuming a very low visibility . " Rheinhardt found himself standing beside a mahogany desk in a lavishly appointed office viewing a monstrous factory complex through the observation screen . " Jesus , " he said . He went to the window , and putting his hand on the glass , discovered it to be a set of fuse boxes of extraordinarily satisfactory aspect . " How about that ? " " What ? " Bogdanovich asked him . " I was just adjusting the Big Picture , " Rheinhardt said . " Sure . Well , what we figure , man , is no dealings . Everythingp189is perfectly cool . You go into any other laundry around here and you have dealings . You have to deal with a capitalist and his line of spades . It 's like a bank , man , it 's a bad groove . Like , where will the bad eye come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much humanity for a laundry . There 's the capitalist , he wears a sportshirt and a rubber glove . I mean , that 's bizarre , man , nobody likes that . Then behind him those poor chicks are scrubbing for their daily bread  --  It 's a tableau , dig , it 's too much world for one small room . " The joint passed between them , growing hotter . Outside the washers and dryers purred at the ready . " But here . . . " " Just machines , " Rheinhardt said . " Here , " Bogdanovich said . " No capitalist , no spades . No deals . Just the machines . The machines have slots , you put your money in them and they go click . You get a satisfying thrust of the wrist and in the end you pull out your very own laundry warm and wet . " " It 's like birth , " Rheinhardt said . " Re-birth , man , " Bogdanovich said . " That 's what it 's like . It 's a link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a connection to the elemental stuff of life . " " Then too , " Rheinhardt said , " there 's the dryers . " " Oh , man , you know , man , I wo n't say no more . Just go out there and spread your arms out and put yourself up against one of those dryers and see what that 's like . Warmth , man , " he said in a deep hoarse whisper . " Warmth . " From his shirt pocket he took an alligator clip in which he bound the last fraction of the joint . " And just in case you get lost in all the automation , there 's me . For love , man , the barest trace of a human hand . " Bogdanovich stuffed the remnants into the end of a Kool and went out to open the street door . Rheinhardt pressed his cold palms against one of the dryers and began to laugh . " Do they like to talk , " he asked Bogdanovich . " A lot of them do . You know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I been able to turn a lot of them onto health foods  --  they come back sometimes and tell me about they feel better . Y ' see , they have a very unhealthy diet down here . They fry everything . Veal , they like . Veal . " Ile made an unpleasant grimace and shrugged . " I tell them about eating dead animal flesh . A lot of them listen . " " Hmm , " Rheinhardt said . " I 'm very gregarious , dig , and I like to turn people on to the good action . Sometimes I get carried away . " He poured some soap in the number ten washer and turned it on with a key that was attached to his alligator clip . " Did you ever see a blue-eyed spade ? " " Sure . " " Blue-eyed spades are a scene . I was in here after midnight About three weeks ago , I was just going to close down and I locked the door and went back in there to blow up . I had just about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , and I heard it open and I looked out and here 's this little blue-.eyed spade working one of the machines . Like he 's got a file and a plastic strip and all this stuff , and a straw hat with a groovy band , very dapper cat , very dapper . He 's bending over givin ' it hell , singing souly music , dig , but he ca n't break that thing , man , because he ai n't equipped . Pretty soon he starts blowin ' his cool  --  he calls ' em down , he starts bangin ' them . He knows he got to hit all the machines to make any bread and pretty soon the cops are coming by . Well , I was fascinated , man , I just stood fascinated and watched him wail . Then he straightened up and got this funny look on his face . What was happening , dig , is I got the door open and he 's smelling the gage drift out . Before I could stop myself I was out there talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't worry man , there ai n't no bread in there worth cutting cane for . If you 're real short , I 'll loan you two bucks . And I start in tellin ' him how it was . I could n't stop myself , I was just out there doing it . I was skulled , dig , I did n't know who I was.  | " For a long time he just stood there lookin ' at me with those baby-blue eyes , he was sort of a little cat . And you know what his eyes say ? " " What ? " Rheinhardt asked . " Nothing . I do n't mean they do n't say anything , I mean they say nothing . Nothing . Not here . Nobody home . Forget it . Like it was a mistake . I had no business in the world out there . I should have stayed behind the door and blown my gage . But it 's too late now . There 's him , there 's me , the existence principal is all turned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and then he sort of giggles and his jaw shifts gears and I can see the face muscle going up and down . He gigglesand he says , " Hey , dad , you some kind of a fool . " " So , " Rheinhardt said . " I see . " " I told him that 's right , dad , you can look at it that way , I 'm some kind of a fool . ' And I talked to him some more but I was just talking now , I was just marking it . All of a sudden his face lights up in a great big smile and the next thing I knew there was-a whoosh by my ear and my man has a five-pound claw hammer and he just tried to drive me through the floor of my own laundry like he was John Henry and I was the Golden Rivet . I grab up a box of Tide and let him have it by the handful . You should have seen it , man you should have been me to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . A box of Tide . But I think that 's very sad . Why should he want to do me that way . " " Maybe he did n't think you were the Golden Rivet , " Rheinhardtsaid . " Maybe he thought you were the Captain . " " Ah , Captain , " Bogdanovich said . " Captain Marvel . Captain Midnight . I think that 's very sad , man . " " Well , you ca n't save the world that way , Bogdanovich , " Rheinhardt said . " I do n't have to tell you that . " " Shit , " Bogdanovich said . " Save it ! You ca n't even talk to it . You ca n't even hail the son of a bitch . " " You ca n't hail it , " Rheinhardt said , " you ca n't tell it to chingo it 's madre . "  | " Maybe you can turn it on . " " It does n't turn on , " Rheinhardt said . " It 's too busy . It has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like some chicks . Well maybe you can break its cool . You can tell it how it 's flat . " He took a short jump in the air and brought both feet down on the tiled floor . " Hey , butch , you 're flat , man , " he told the world . " I know what we can do , Rheinhardt , we can try to reach it on the radio . " He went to a counter near the window that was piled with back copies of Life and flicked on an old splintering Emerson . " What 's the call sign for the world , man ? " " Try WUSA . Six Seven Oh . " " World , " Bogdanovich said " this is Hetman Bogdanovich of the Laundrymatic Corporation . I give you the Great Motherfinger . How do you read me ? Over . " The room was suddenly filled with the voice of Farley the Sailor. " . . . that over the vast fields of the slumbering Republic , " Farley was saying , " assisted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill-sorted legions of the ill-fitted and the unfit , by the vile mouthings of rash youth educated beyond its intelligence , and by the omnipresent specter of an inexorably devouring , insatiably consuming hydra like federal government the twin pterodactyls of atheistic communism and communistic atheism spread the winged shadow of Beelzebub . .. " " Holy shit , " Bogdanovich said , " this must be that Orson Wells jive . " " No . It 's politics , " Rheinhardt said . " Man those poor people asleep in those towns , man . He sounds like somebody do n't he . Somebody real . " " He sounds sort of like Churchill , " Rheinhardt said . " He 's doing that . " " Where then are the Paul Reveres of our imperiled age ? Where indeed when those ready to ride and spread the alarm over , as it were , every Middlesex village and farm are treacherouslyunhorsed by deceitful grooms in the pay of foreign dynas/ties . Oh Lord , hear us that You let the scales fall from the eyes of Thy people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities , in the farms and fields , all as one , the mighty and the humble together , shoulder to shoulder , rank on rank , not to bend their steel into the ploughshares of serfdom , but rather to raise in the pure unsullied sunlight of Thy grace , the invincible excalibur of States ' Rights , Free Enterprise , and Individual Initiative . " " What a great cat ! " Bogdanovich said . " Hooray , man ! Let 's wake up and glomm those fuckin ' birds , man ! " " Yeah , he 's a scene , " Rheinhardt said . " He 's one of the best in the business . " " And now , " Farley said , " let us ask together that a Great and Good God continue to endow us with the holy fire of living grace , until , if He will it , we meet again ! " " Amen , man , " Bogdanovich said . The announcer 's voice came on : " You have heard the Living Grace Hour , another weekly address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missionary Society of New Orleans . The Society is a non-profit religious enterprise dedicated to the spiritual rehabilitation of the misguided . Your financial support helps this good work ; send contributions to ... " " Hey , " Bogdanovich said . " That 's somebody too . " " That 's me . " " You too , " Bogdanovich said wonderingly . " You 're out there too  --  " " I 'm always out there , " Rheinhardt said . " I weave in and out of the stuff . I 'm part of it . " Bogdanovich turned off the Emerson and looked out the street . " Man , " he said . " That 's some radio . And those concepts  --  they 're weird , man . " " Concepts ? " " They 're weird . Like the darkling pterodactyls and the enroachingfederal government . That 's a very weird concept . " " It 's all weird . It 's the world , you remember . " " You think all that 's going on ? "  | " That 's his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something 's going on out there . " " Yeah ? The concepts , though  --  the pterodactyls , the deceitfulgrooms , all that shit , man . The Communist concept and the other people concept and all those concepts , you think that 's reallygoing on ? Maybe it 's all a put on . How about that ? Look , " he said , pointing a finger at Rheinhardt , " you stand right here where I 'm standing and it 's very quiet . There 's nothing to hear but the machines and us . From where I 'm standing I ca n't see anything either , not a soul , just an empty street . Then I turn on that radio , dig , and people  --  you , man  --  start talking this rebop with grooms and pterodactyls and the United States of America . And the Russians and the Indians and the Cowboys and the Toronto Maple Leafs . All these . . . all these concepts , man ? You say that 's really going on out there ? " " What 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are like a few billion people walking around and every one of them has a head with a lot of stuff going on in it . And if you want to hear what that sounds like , just turn on the radio . You do n't need television to see it . You can just walk outside that door and put your hand in it 's goddamn side . " " Not me , " Bogdanovich said . " I 'm not going out that door . I think it 's a put on , man . There is n't anything outside that door but Now . That 's all , man . Just Now . If you kept on going past all those people and their trips , you know what it would all look like ? Stars , man . Stars . " " Oh , " Rheinhardt said . " Stars ? " " Stars . And how about inside , man . That 's just as big , the inside . Galaxies , man . These people with their concepts . They 're tripping out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the galaxies out there  --  past where all the people are  --  and the galaxies in here , they got what they call civilization and they never turn it off . That 's the name of the trip . That 's what you hear in the box . " " Man , that 's not civilization , " Bogdanovich said anxiously . " Civilization is music and the arts , man . Civilization is culti/vated women like your Natasha and my Natasha . Civilization is proper diet . Mens sana in corpore sano , that 's what civilization is . " " That 's the civilization of the mind , " Rheinhardt said . " That 's your trip . " " I used to know this cat , " Bogdanovich said , " every time you told him something he would say , Everything is relative . ' " " He was right . But he probably did n't know how relative everything was , or he would n't have said it . " " He did n't know anything , man . Nothing . All he knew was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact of the matter is that everything is so fucking relative that I 'm going out of my mind . I 'm going somewhere and flip . But until then , man , I 'm staying right here in this laundry because out there , man "  --  he pointed to the twilight street  --  " it 's too relative . " Rheinhardt went to the door and looked past the banana stalks at the frame houses opposite . The sun was not quite gone . But it happened so damn fast there the dark came on . So fast . He watched the line of reddening sunlight play on the green top shutters of the house opposite . God , he thought , the air . How sweet it is . " Listen , " he asked Bogdanovich , " tell me about flipping . Tell me about that . " " Ah , man , " Bogdanovich said sadly . " Why ? " He unplugged the number ten machine and turned to look at Rheinhardt . " Do you feel like it ? " " I think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , man . He 's an authority . He says you have to work up to it for it to be worthwhile , like you have to blow a lot of pot to get the fantasy equipment going and not sleep for a couple of days . You probably do n't eat right anyway . He says you get to a scene where the stuff that the world is made out of changes  --  like you can tell when you put your hand on it because it feels different . And the light 's different . He says you get this taste in your mouth and then you 're set up . But that 's him . "  | " Yes , " Rheinhardt said . " Marvin says nobody ought to do it unless they have to . But you know that . " " Sure , " Rheinhardt said , laughing , " everything is relative . " " That 's right , man , " Bogdanovich said . " Hey listen , you want to blow some more ? Clear your head ? " " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk . " Ile shook hands with Bogdanovich and went out into the street . Children were playing " red light " in muddy gardens rounded with iron fences ; a covey of teen-aged girls at a corner Sno-Ball stand saluted him in mock horror . Iclly walking , he crossed the street to the last thin line of sunlight and found himselffollowing a tall stone wall grown with rose and honeysuckle ; it brought him to a latticed gate over which a small , iron Christ stared down in wide-eyed rusty death from the gibbet of a green , oxided cross . Great rich roses grew all around it , the vines were making their way between the nails and feet climbing the staff of the cross itself . Rheinhardt passed beneath it and down a gravel path between two straight rows of dark stone tombs . The sun had disappeared behind the distant uptown buildings , the day 's last light hung round a cluster of live oaks at the end of the corridorof tombs . There was still no wind , the place was absolutely quiet except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked from crypt to crypt inspecting the carved urns and the black brass bolts over the seals . The gage , he thought , was funny stuff , it could make you so cold . And tired . He kept walking toward the trees , a great fatigue rising in him . At the feet of a man named Prosper Thibault , he paused to lean against a stone bench and saw the inside of the wall that faced the street ; it was itself set with more modest tombs , niches actually , like a shelf of drawers . The slabs stood four high , engravedneatly with the name and chronology of the occupants ; there were several generations of families , a section of infants , a row of nuns from the last century . Rheinhardt kept on , breathingthe sweet honeysuckle , wanting more and more to lie downp197across the path , to lay his head on the soft bright grass that grew by the foot of the way . He touched a niche , fingering the stone ; it was carved with the folds of a mantle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops of blood . A shadow lengthened from the trees and he saw a figure weavingtoward him , it was a boy riding his bicycle up the path , thrust between the handlebars the boy had a bamboo pole from which a brace of wet catfish hung at either end . The boy came straight for him , the bike wobbling with its burden on the unsteady ground , and Rheinhardt moved against the entombments and saw the boy glance at him briefly and fearfully , a line of perspirationround his close-cropped hair , frowning , bending over the bars to peddle harder for the gate and home . Rheinhardt looked after him , then turned to see the live oaks grown dark and barely visible ; it was nearly night . He had stopped to rest at another bench when he became aware of footsteps in the place other than his own . He became suddenly afraid ; crouching by one of the tombs , he saw a man 's shadow darting in and out of the rows . IIe moved forward quickly into the next path and came upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man stepped back in surprise and squinted at him in the failing light ; the young man 's face was lusterless and drawn , his Adam 's apple throbbed over an open collar button . It was Morgan Rainey . " Jesus , " Rheinhardt said . IIe found himself suddenly angry . The son of a bitch is not only a morgue attendant , he thought , he 's a ghost . " Are you all right ? " Morgan Rainey asked . " I 'm groovy , " Rheinhardt said . " I 'm sorry , " Morgan Rainey said . He made no move to pass . " Sure , " Rheinhardt said . " I 'm taking a walk , you dig , only at the moment I 'm not walking because I happen to be standing here . " " I thought you were ill , " Rainey said , and stepped around him and up the path . Rheinhardt looked after him , gnawing his lip in a rage thatp198surprised him . It seems I hate you , my friend , he thought . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stricken , that 's why , because they have more darts in you and you are about to be pulled out of the barrel and consumed and I hate you for it . You do n't fear him for being a ghost , he told himself , you fear him for being a stricken fool , a much more terrifying thing , withal , And fools are evil he thought . All fools are evil . He walked for a long time , stopping in a bar across the road from City Park to have a few beers and watch a little of the Wednesday night fights . The bartender was a small squat old man , an ex-lightweight from the ' twenties named Esposito , the bar was hung with pictures of him ; there was one with his arm around Ralph Dupas and standing , suited , in a ring with Po'boy Italo Pozzi . Rheinhardt watched him stand by the tap , noddingand weaving with the boys on the screen , laughing , turning with a gesture to his cronies at the end of the bar . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the park to catch the Claiborne Street bus uptown . It was a hot close night , the streetlights on Canal were ringed with mist , the foul exhumations from the river-front breweries hung fetid on the air . At the action corner of Bourbon Street , Rheinhardt played the pinball machines for a quarter 's worth and bought a paper container of beer to take to the studio . ' Walking down Iberville Street toward the freight entrance of Torneille 's , he heard the clear rounded report of a pistol from somewhere deeper in the Quarter ; he stopped momentarily , walked on and ten paces later heard the first siren , then others , rising until they filled the night and died . The jukeboxes in the corner bars played " Walk Do n't Run , " farther away a weary clarinetgave the piccolo treatment to " That 's a'plenty " for the four thousandth time . Rheinhardt went on toward Torneille 's ramp . He was just turning in when a woman 's voice held him ; he turned and saw someone crouched in a doorway beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rodent-like face and straw-colored hair just visible in the glass-reflected light . Herp199legs were stretched out before her , encased in metal braces , and her eyes stared straight ahead at some place beyond seeing . " Go back to the one that loves ye , " the woman crooned and laughed softly . " What , " Rheinhardt said . " Philomene ? " Still staring she began to sing . Oh go back to the one that loves yeOr the tides of life ' 11 tear ye apartAnd the black clouds that roll up above ye Will close on the hopes of your heart . Rheinhardt bent over her and moved his hand before her gaze . She never blinked . " Philomene , " he said , " are you all right ? " This is a night for solicitude , Rheinhardt thought , we all want to know if we 're all all right . Actually everybody is fine , everybody is just out for a walk tonight . " Can you stand up , love ? " he asked Philomene . Philomene took his arm and pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm teasing them , " she said . " I 'm hiding out on them one time . " She took a rattling step forward and whistled in pain . " Ah , shit , " she said . " Go back to the one that loves ye , friends . " " You sing very well , " Rheinhardt told her . He put two dollars in her hand and watched her move toward Royal Street , laughing and whistling to herself . The elevators in Torneille 's and WUSA 's bright new receptionroom were staffed by young men in rayon suits who looked as though they might enjoy close-order drills ; they wore lapel pins with the Eagle and Thunderbolt . The young man at the visitor 's desk , Rheinhardt remembered from the Bing Chemical Company . " Good evening , Mr. , " he said , pressing the electronic door control . Rheinhardt told him good evening and went into the studiop200corridor . Jack Noonan came out of the ticker room with a folder full of copy and salaamed to him . " Bingamon wants to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight him . " " This is my home , " Rheinhardt said , " and he 's my daddy . " Irving the Engineer was sitting at his turntable in the booth reading the day 's log . He turned to give Rheinhardt a look of profound sympathy . " How 's school , bubbala ? " " School is delightfully wonderful , " Irving said . " How about you , bubbala ? You drunk again ? " " Thirsty work , lad , thirsty work . " " Listen , " Irving said , " tomorrow I 'm coming in drunk . " He held up a red transcription press . " I 've listened to some stupid idiots around this place but here , " he waved the press , " is the most preposterous stupid idiot I have ever heard . " " That can only be one man , " Rheinhardt said thoughtfully . Irving stood up , opened the studio door and stood listening silently . At length they heard the loud and reassuring laughter of Farley the Sailor . Irving closed the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the champion schmuck of the earth . You have to hear him to believe him . Parson Heathcliff or something , he 's called . " " I caught his wind-up this afternoon . He does have a way with him . " " The wind-up was nothing . Jesus , let me play the first part for you . " He glanced at his watch . " We got time . " " I 'll listen to it when we close , " Rheinhardt said . " I want to go dig him in the flesh . He 's my old goodbuddy . " He went out and down the corridor to the employee 's lounge , following the rich tones of Farley in full flower . " The natural law . . . " Farley was declaiming earnestly " . . . the perennial philosophy . " He was standing beside a bonsai pine , dressed for a papa audience ; his customary suit of solemn black was the true silk ; his shirt , white on white ; his necktie , Cambridge . On a nearby chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a freckled lady of about forty , richly dressed and with rather a pleasing build ; her unashamed reverence was addressed to Farley 's countenance . Rheinhardt approached piously . " Excuse me , eminence , " he said to Farley . " Excuse me , ma'am . " The lady burbled . Farley cleared his throat . " Might we have a word about next week 's lesson ? " " Of course , my boy , " Farley said . " Mrs. Mac Allister , this is Mr. Rheinhardt an . . . official . . . of the station  --  Rheinhardt , Sister Mac Allister , a steadfast receiver of the Good News . " " How do you , " Rheinhardt said . They went through a set of double doors into the studio corridor , where Farley looked at Rheinhardt with displeasure . " Where 's your mucking cool , eh Rhein ? Stow that eminence routine  --  the lady may be slow but she 's not a cretin and moreovershe 's a bloody Baptist . " " Sorry , Pastor . What 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcendental leer . " Well I 'm all right , Jack . " He fingered his somber lapels . " The word is Good . . . Fucking . . . News . Did you dig today'slesson ? " " I sure did , " Rheinhardt said . " It wiped me out . " Farley chortled . " You do n't think it was a bit . . . purple ? " " Not a bit of it . " " You have no idea , Rheinhardt , the number of letters that came in after only four broadcasts . Ecstatic paeons of praise , old boy , my mail box is full of them . There are even some threateningletters . " " Great , " Rheinhardt said . " Nothing too depressing , I hope . " " When you get threatening letters , Rheinhardt , it means noone doubts that you 're legit . The only one that gave me a pauseis signed  --  I 've been trying to recall the name . Thought it mightbe some old acquaintance intent on queering my action . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offoolscap on which a brief message was penned in red ink :  | " You are a hooley like all preachers and can be exposed . I have the goods on you as a hyena and will bring about retribution for the sacrifice of my life and home on Greed 's Altar . " It was signed S. B. Prothwaite . " Do we know him ? " Farley asked . " Did you run into him at the mission or somewhere ? " " Never heard of him , Farley . He sounds like an honest nut to me . " " The river 's the place for a chap like that , " Farley said thoughtfully . " What with the money involved  --  " he paused to reflect on the money involved . " Yes , by God , " he told Rheinhardt , " the Gold Flag is up and you put me on to it . I wo n't forget you , shipmate . " " It 's nothing , Heathcliff . What 's working with the lady ? " " Widow , " Farley said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's helping with organization in the Society . " " Bingamon wo n't like it if you branch too far into your own hustle . Is n't he the Living Grace Society now ? " " Oh he 's the Great White Father , mate , I do n't question that . But I run the society for him and I 've got a free hand in a few directions at least . " He glanced over his shoulder toward the lounge . " It 's bigger than I dared hope , Rheinhardt . " His face became soulful , suggestive of inward edification . " There you came to my door , mate , wretched and diseased with drink . If my heart had been hardened I might have turned you away . But instead I took you in and you led me straight to a recompense greater than I 've ever known . I 'd have to be the most thick shelled of atheists to overlook the pattern there . " " Listen , Heathcliff , " Rheinhardt said brightly , " if you ever feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass . You want to ? " Farley recoiled in horror . " Get the bloody hell behind me , Satan , " he said sternly . " Are you out of your mind ? You 're a sick man , Rheinhardt  --  you 're fucking depraved , old boy . I clean you up from the juice andp203now you 're a teahead . You 'll end up like Natasha that way . " " Anyhow that 's not my high , what ? " IIe gestured toward the lounge where Mrs. Mac Allister waited . " I 've got my toke in there . " Smoothing his forelock , he raced back through the double doors . Rheinhardt went back to his turntable and broke out the log book . Irving was in the control booth watching the clock . " Hey , Rhein , " he called through the intercom , " why do n't you use another Supremes ? " " Crazy , " Rheinhardt said , " drop that Birds thing and we 'll run Book of Love . ' " " You want Book of Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Irving threw the switches and ran a commercial press , the red lights went on over his head , the bulb beside Rheinhardt 's mike flashed . When the commercial had run , Irving threw the cue and Rheinhardt came in over his theme  --  " Walk Do n't Run . " " Yeah , " he said , " all you swingers in this great big wonderful Southerland , all you guys and you pretty little girls , you folks on the nightside  --  whether you 're driving or having a groovy White Fortress Dixieburger or out in the all-night laundries  --  I Iello you all ! " He turned his volume switch down , swallowed a Ritalin and took a quick sip of beer . " Let 's have us some crazy sounds . . .. " Morgan Rainey found Mr. Clotho in a room behind the cafe . Mr. Clotho was seated at a pigeon-hole desk surrounded by severalpiano-roll pianos ; the desk cubicles were stuffed with old faded rolls . " Pick a tune , Mr. Rainey , " he said .

" " You have so many , " Rainey said . " These , " Mr. Clotho said , holding up a crocheted bag full of piano rolls , " belonged to Mrs. Breaux . " " Mrs. who ? " Rainey said . " Why you forgot , Mr. Rainey . Mrs. Breaux was my tenant , the lady who received your solicitude the other week . " " Of course , " Rainey said . " I forgot her name . " " They must be wearing you down in the department . Theymust be spreading your concern thin with constant employ . " " Names . . . " Rainey said , " are not what I remember .

" Mr. Clotho suggested . " Yes , " Rainey said . " Out of touch . " " We secured an oven for Mrs. Breaux with the proceeds of her estate . She had all the sorts of things that the young sophisticateslike to buy nowadays . Old-timey things . " " An oven ? " " An oven , " Mr. Clotho said . " In the cemetery . " " Oh yes , " Rainey said . " Let 's get you back in touch , " Mr. Clotho said sympathetically . " Let 's see if we can speak to your concern today . Who 's going to receive the benefit of your professional competence this afternoon ? " " A Mr. Hoskins , " Rainey said . He was having trouble with his eyes . " A Mr. Lucky Hoskins . " Mr. Clotho nodded . " Mr. Lucky Hoskins it shall be . " He stood up and led Rainey out of the room and into an inside stairway with red walls . They climbed three flights and walked into a hallway where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over knotted woodwork and the afternoon sun camep205through the wall slats to throw arches of orange light over the slanted corridor . Mr. Clotho paused before a door , listened for a moment , and rapped on a rosy panel . " Somebody at the door , " a voice inside observed . " Now somebodyat the door . " " It 's Mr. Clotho , " Mr. Clotho called brightly . When the door opened , they saw a tall , brown , roundshoulderedman peering uneasily into the pink light . He was extremelyfat ; his belly swelled and sagged beneath his white shirt . Under his belt , his pinstripe trousers were cleaved in folds of paunch . He had one arm . The empty sleeve had not been pinned conventionally across his breast , but was bunched up at the armpit in a sweated wad . " Clotho , what you want , man ? " Mr. Lucky Hoskins said . He leaned out to look over to Mr. Clotho 's shoulder and saw Rainey against the wall . " Oh what now , " he asked sadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now Lucky , " Mr. Clotho said , " this gentleman is not trouble of any sort . Why no ! He 's here to inquire after you , man , on behalf of the government and his own concern . He 's a social scientist . " " I wo n't be long , Mr. Hoskins , " Rainey said . " We 're engaged in a survey of welfare clients . I just want some figures and then we 'll leave you be . " Mr. Hoskins moved from the doorway with a soft shifting of his bulk and went to sit on the edge of his bed . There was no window in the room . Above the bed , there was a barred skylight over a wooden trap through which they heard the cooing of pigeons . A single bulb burned faintly in the wall . On chairs and night tables in other parts of the room were piled four or five clays ' food remnants  --  soiled paper plates with chicken bones , crumpled barbecue-chip wrappers , empty peanut bags , greasy tin foil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detectivemagazines and a cache of gallon wine bottles . On the bedp206beside Mr. Hoskins , a magazine was folded open . Its cover showed two storm troopers leeringly menacing a naked and pinionedblonde with barbed-wire whips . Hoskins was gently and rhythmically rocking up and down in his bed ; the measured straining of the springs against his weight seemed to hold him hypnotized . " What benefits are you receiving , then ? " Rainey asked . " I get fifty dollar a month from the army , " Hoskins said . " And you get a supplement from local welfare ? " " Yessuh . Every month . " He watched Rainey 's gaze take in the magazines and bottles . " I don ' never spend the welfare money on no drinkin ' , " he said . " I know what ai n't allowed . I only spen ' the money I get from the govinment . " " Of course , " Rainey said . He took a green form from his portfolioand sat down in a chair . " Have you income from employment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Clotho said . " That was his right arm , the absent one . " Lucky Hoskins rocked on the springs and nodded in agreement . " Did you lose it in the war ? " Rainey asked . " That 's right . " " But you should get more than that , then , " Rainey said , turningby instinct to Mr. Clotho . " Fifty dollars a month is hardly enough for a disability like that . " Mr. Clotho smiled as though recalling braver days . " Lucky was a handsome and robust soldier , " he said happily . " He was a non-commissioned officer and a fine champion prize-fighter . " " In Panama , " Lucky Hoskins said soberly . " Firs ' as a middleweight . Then as a heavy . I was heavyweight champ of that districtfrom ' 36 to ' 39 . " " How long were you in the army ? " " Fourteen years , " Hoskins said.  | " And where were you wounded ? " " Mistuh , " Hoskins said , " I tol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than they lets me . " " Lucky Hoskins , you tell your story , " Clotho said with mock sternness . " This gentleman has come to hear . " " Mr. Hoskins , " Rainey said . " There are benefits available now that maybe they did n't have when you were discharged . They have programs to help handicapped veterans that you might not know about . I might be able to help you in some way . " No good come from talkin ' , " Hoskins said . " Maybe trouble though . " " They made him a sergeant when the war started , " Mr. Clotho said . " He was in a black regiment of engineers in the Canal Zone . They made him a sergeant and they put him in another black regiment and sent him off to war . Then in Italy they went and blew poor Lucky 's arm off . " " From a Cocasola Field to that big of leper colony I built all the road . I built all that road around there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell him just like you told me . " " It was over passes , " Lucky Hoskins said , rising and sinking gently on the bed . " Everybody was steamed up for passes to Napoli . " They waited , listening to the creaking springs . " All right , " Lucky Hoskins said . " We was down below Cassinowhile the artillery was tryin ' to get the Krauts loose and the word began to go roan ' after a while that they was set to move us up to the line . There was a couple of outfits there with us , white outfits , and we knowed they was gettin ' passes and we was n't . See , this old man had us out diggin ' ten , twelve hour  --  duckin ' infiltrators and bustin ' our asses , and then ever ' night we go home to tent alley and sit aroun ' playin ' pocket pool and watchin ' the trucks come and take these other boys to Napoli . Us , why they would n't even let us down in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' other outfit in that valley was gettin ' theirs and they would n't let us , you see what I mean ? The boys was steamed up . I was steamed up myself . " After they couldn ' get Cassino they started holdin ' the other outfits too and the whole valley was jus ' one mass of pissin ' and moanin ' personnel . Then one day the bunch up the valley from us got word they was gon na be moved up to the line that week and they started agitatin ' for passes to town . " Nex ' afternoon when they secure from diggin ' , the bunch up valley got them all but the duty men slicked up in pass clothes and start straight out of the bivouac area . They all together on the road to town and the O.D. call for a couple of companies of M.P . ' s . Well them boys jus ' keep right on walkin ' when the M.P . ' s tol ' em stop  --  they kep ' goin and yelled to the M.P . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they figured on dyin ' but they was gon na try and get some before they die . By God they jus ' kep ' right on goin ' and them M.P . ' s stand there open mouth and lookin ' at each other and let ' em walk through . Took them sombitchesall night to round that outfit up . Nex ' day everyone in the valley heard about it . " Right then , some of the boys start sayin ' , shit , if they let them get away with that then we do the same damn thing ' cause how come they rate ? " Right away the oldtimers , me and the other regulars , we try to tell ' em  --  look here ! In the firs ' place , we knowed that 14 . P. regiment from Sam Houston and they was all from East Texas , Oklahoma , and they had it in for us . Second place , those studs already lookin ' bad ' cause they let that 188th walk away from them and they jus ' lookin ' for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s , and in the third place , any black regiment that tries what a white regiment done got away with them motherfuckers gon na get cut down ! " But them guys  --  you could n't tell ' em nothin ' , they was young and goin ' crazy from not havin ' any and top they was scared to die . I seen ' em that afternoon slickin ' up and the first thing I think is to go get the O.D. , but I found out that manp209ai n't even in the area . By the time I get talkin ' with the senior N.C.O. 's it was jus ' about too late . Them boys is formed in ranks and swingin ' on down to the road checkpoint . You know , they been workin ' on each other and drinkin ' wine they buy off the dagos . " Well , I grab my gear , and while I 'm on my way to try headin ' them off I take a look around and I see that the whole rise and all the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see there mus ' be four , five , companies of M.P . ' s up there , sort of hid out and all of ' em got riot guns and down by the storm gate they even got some BAR 's set up . I jus ' look at them boys and I knew damn well what I was seein ' . " Lucky Hoskins reached down to scratch the inside of his pinstripedthigh . He paused a moment , dull-eyed , looking beyond Rainey who was in a chair opposite him . Then he began to bounce up and down on the bed again . " Well , they nearly out pass the gate when I got up in front of ' em . Was about four hundred men together ; mos ' of ' em in pass uniform , but some of ' em jus ' plumb out of uniform , just marchin ' toward that gate . I take another look roun ' and see their rifles up and I start yellin ' Goddam , you all out of you mind  --  do n't you see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you walkin ' into , ' I tell them  --  Do n't you see them white men up there waitin ' to strike you down ? ' But , lord , they wo n't stop . So then I start lookin ' for men in my company and I call ' em down by name : I see Big John and Matthews and them boys and I yell for them to stop  --  Hey Big John , where you goin ' , man , they gon na kill your dumb ass . ' I tell ' em  --  and some of ' em sort of stops then , but the crowd jes ' carry them on , and right then I hear the M.P . first sergeant with his megaphone yell halt jes ' calm and easy like there was n't anythin ' for them to worry about and then Halt , he say again , and some of the guys on the side now turn aroun ' sudden and run like hell but the res ' jes ' keep walkin ' , and I 'm comin ' round behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' between them and then the M.P . captaincome down and call Halt and the front line start to run likep210maybe they was n't gon na run forward but it was just like the line broke and then , Lord , I see them two BAR men stand up and start firm ' , firs ' one and then the other I see them move in firm ' them BAR 's , and right then the whole bunch of them opens up , and I go down and when I look up I see they ai n't roundin ' nobody up , they ai n't collarin ' nobody , they don ' nothin ' but shootin ' and I see they ai n't no more ranks but there 's jes ' men lyin ' around and I ca n't see who outright dead and who jes ' coverin ' up , but them M.P . ' s jes ' keep comin ' now , and they ai n't shootin ' into those men up front now they shootin ' everywhere , they shootin ' into the mess area and the medic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alley , the whole bivouac area and that M.P . captain come up in his jeep screamin ' his head off for them to stop shootin ' , but they do n't stop . And then I see that man come up pullin ' a grenade carrier . I figure , lord , here I 'm right here and that man bringin ' up tear gas and I start to get up and hail him with my hands up and I see him bring the carrier up and I see the grenade comin ' and me half up and half down and I jump as far and as fast as I kin . " Lucky Hoskins paused again to rub the wet mass of shirting at his right arm pit . The groaning springs beneath him was the only sound in the room . " But that man got me all the same . And it was n't no tear gas he was throwin ' . That was what stopped it , I guess , they stopped after that . I never did go out and I guess it must of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in that hospital iii Napoli two months with some of the other guys , could n't write no letters , could n't see nobody . Then they sort of split us up  --  I go to bed one night and damn if I do n't wake up the next day in Iceland somewheres . Man comes aroun ' with the chaplain then and asks me how do I like a honorable discharge and fifty a month for life . I did n't even think about it . I say sure , that 's fine , give it to me , and let me alone ' cause it been fourteen years I put in and I think now that 's enough army . That make them happy , I guess.  | " And you know what I think about ? I think about I meet this boy in the Napoli Hospital that was on sentry duty for an outfit just the other side of the hill from the area . He tell me that when they hear all that , him and his platoon come runnin ' and they see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tore up now and he say , man , we had rifles and we seen it and why was it we did n't do nothin ' but stand there , how come we did n't open up on the sombitches ? I tell him , boy don ' worry ' bout it , they tol ' you you was on their side . ' " " I see , " Morgan Rainey said . " I hear they sent that M.P . regiment to the Pacific . I always did wonder how they made out . " Morgan Rainey sat in the chair and listened to the creaking springs of Lucky Hoskins ' bed . " How long have you lived here ? " " Here ? In this place ? " " Fifteen years , " Clotho said . " That 's right , " Hoskins said . " Mos ' since I got out . That 'd be fifteen . " " Fifteen years , " Rainey said . " In this room ? " " What difference would that make , my dear sir ? " Mr. Clotho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lucky Hoskins nodded assent , and rocked expectantly . Rainey sat in his chair with the green form spread out across his lap . " Lucky prefers a hotel arrangement on account of his disability , " Mr. Clotho advised him . " You know I think he 's rather afraid to go out because of that arm . he just swoops out once every few days for provisions and then he swoops right back in . " " This ai n't no neighborhood not to have a right arm in . Folks know I got a pension . " " How is it . . . " Rainey began . " How do you . . . " " I think Mr. Rainey wants you to say how it is , Hoskins . He wants to know if it all gets you down . " " Yeah , " Lucky Hoskins said , rocking . " It gets me down . "  | " I do n't know , " Rainey said dully . " I do n't know exactly what provisions there are that could help you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say I was askin ' for more money , mistuh , " Lucky Hoskinssaid . " I ai n't askin ' . " " Of course , " Rainey said . He put his form away and stood up . " Of course . " He went out into the hall with Mr. Clotho . " Were you ever in the army , Mr. Rainey ? " Clotho asked as they walked down the red stairway . " I 'm 4-F , " Rainey said . " I had rheumatic fever when I was a teen-ager . " They went through the room with the player pianos and out to the patio where the clothes lines were . " You 're getting transportation today , " Clotho said . " Your colleagueMister Arnold 's going to pick you up on the corner at four o'clock . They called us and told us to tell you that . " " Oh . " " They think you need help in getting your completed charts back to the office . " " Oh , " Rainey said . In the yards beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rubber ball by turns and singing . Rainey stood and listened to their voices echo in the shafts and cellars of the old alley . The goose walk fineThe monkey drank wineThey all went a-ridin ' on the street car lineRainey fanned himself with the portfolio . There was no breeze and the wash hung motionless on the lines . " I 'm just thinking , " he told Mr. Clotho , " of that man living fifteen years up there . " " You 're overcome , are you , Mr. Rainey , because crippled old men live in small rooms ? "  | " That is n't strange at all , is it ? " Rainey said . " Are you overcome for me , Mr. Rainey ? I 've been here for fifteen years . " " Yes , " Rainey said , looking up at the stairwells and shuttered windows around them . " But this is yours . " " Yes indeed , " Mr. Clotho said . A company of small boys ducked around the wooden fence at one side of the patio and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran about the yard challenging each other and panting out martial music for background . One of the boys struck his stick repeatedly against the fence . Rainey was pale and sweating ; his eyes were red-rimmed and he blinked continually although they stood out of the sun . " Just in the interest of a valuable interracial dialogue , " Mr. Clotho asked , " to what do you attribute your finely developed sensibilities ? " " I do n't know what you 're talking about , Mr. Clotho , " Rainey said . " I suppose you 'd have to be able to observe yourself in action to know . " Mr. Clotho wrinkled his forehead and put his hand just above Rainey 's shoulder . " Folks think you act funny , Mr. Rainey . Some say it 's because you 're scared , but I think it 's because you 're so preoccupied with that concern we were talking about . " " Maybe I 'm doing the job wrong . I 'm no professional . " " Mr. Rainey , the job has nothing to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it is , man , some people you look twice at . I 'm inclined to look twice at you . " " Well , " Rainey said , " I ca n't help that . " He was listening to the boy 's stick strike against the boards of the fence . " Maybe you 're a religious man , " Mr. Clotho suggested . Rainey closed his eyes and rubbed them with his fingers , brushing sweat from his eyebrows . " When I was a boy , " he said , " I was concerned with God . " " Ah , " Mr. Clotho said delicately . " Yes , " Rainey said , seeking out Mr. Clotho 's eyes . " I believep214that God is the power that raised up the muck of the earth to walk and think . I believe there is a covenant here . " " That 's what they say , " Mr. Clotho observed . " Otherwise , " Rainey told him , gripping the cardboard portfoliohard with both hands , " we keep finding out the insect in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But they go on to say , Mr. Rainey , that God is in the insect . " " No , " Rainey said . " God is in men . " " You 'd never know it , would you , " Mr. Clotho asked . " You 'd think he was and then he was n't . For example , you 're down here recording all these tales of woe  --  like Mr. Hoskins ' nasty experience . You and I are both southern people , Mr. Rainey . ' We know many stories like that , do n't we ? " " Yes , " Rainey said . " My sister tol ' her  --  " the little girls with the ball sang  --  " Ah kissed a sol'yer  --  now she wo n't buy me  --  a rubber dolly ... " The boys had gone to the next yard and were banging their sticks against the far side of the wall . A week after his father had died , walking at his side , he had gone prowling in the brake at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tar . His father had been buried five days . It was just before the hurricane . The next day he had walked by the river . He told no one . He walked by the river all day . His head hurt , his throat was sore . When he came home that evening , the air had grown altogether still . The trees edging the sidewalk were motionless ; in the lots beside the houses a single stirring flower in the tense waiting grass caught the eye . The sky was gray and hot , against it houses and signposts had the strange sharp clearness of a dream . You could hear switching in the freight yards that were miles away  - -  and beyond them , the voices of negro children and the hammeringof their sticks against wooden porches . You could hear the voices clearly and the brittle splintering of their sticks , yet sounds close by seemed muffled and distant . All softness was gone from the air , it was sharp edged and still  --  hot , cruel and silent air ,  |p215the  air of dark visions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grown afraid . If he looked back , he thought , there might appear against the awful clarity of that evening some dreadful procession of things as they are , visions of what he had seen and what he felt it was his fate to see . " Good God , " he had said aloud . " Gentle God , Merciful and All-Seeing God  --  Father  --  " Words dissolved in the cannibal air . He went into the house and into his father 's death . He heard the tinkling of small things , of hanging brass and table ornaments . His mother was humming in a distant room . His father was dead . A sudden breeze drifted through the huge rooms , a breath of the murderous earth . Dry-throated and trembling , he went up the stairs and into the bathroom and vomited again and again , as the first savage sheets of rain crashed down on Pass Royaume . The hurricane . Rheumatic fever . " Yes , of course , " Rainey told Mr. Clotho , " we all do . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago , " Morgan Rainey said slowly , " I almost had what might be called a breakdown . I had rheumatic fever when I was a teen-ager and then not long ago I came very close  --  very close  --  to a breakdown . But I recovered with what I would say  --  " he turned to Clotho and put out his hand  --  " with what I would say was God 's grace or God 's strength or . . . although I do n't believe . . . although I do n't believe as I did . I recoveredand I chose to face whatever there was . Because of the cov-enant . " " And so we have the benefit of your attentions , " Mr. Clotho said reflectively . " My , my , does n't He worketh in devious ways ? " " What ? " Rainey asked . " You have an appointment , Mr. Rainey . Mr. Arnold is going to drive you downtown . " " Right , " Morgan Rainey said . " That 's right . " Mr. Clotho and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " It 's always a pleasure and a stimulation , Mr. R , " Clotho told him . " Come ' round soon . I see us making great strides toward adjustment . " " Yes , " Rainey said . He walked past the cafe door and around the corner and set his portfolios down against the side of a house . Then he went to the curb and watched the sparse traffic for Matthew Arnold 's car . Another group of children had gathered at the head of a narrowalley on the far side of the street . They watched him stare at the traffic , grinning . Rainey walked up and down nervously blinking at the passing cars ; there was no shade on the corner , the late afternoon sun seared his eyes . A pair of the older boys came across the street ; the smaller ones followed , darting across one by one , like commandos under fire . They moved down the block toward him with exaggerated caution . Turning , Rainey found one of the boys advancing in a crouch toward his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street ; some of the others circled in behind him , bright-eyed with fearful intrepidity . " Hello , " Morgan Rainey said weakly . The children scattered at his voice . " Hello , hello , " they began to sing ; they ranged round him , tripping each other up , colliding , walking bandy-legged in procession , helloing each other unstintingly . Some passersby stopped to watch them . Rainey kept turning to keep the biggest boys from slipping behind him to the papers . He made a sudden rush and succeeded in snatching up the envelopes at the precise moment that the smallest boy in the crowd had gotten his hands on them . " No , " Rainey said , pulling them from the boy 's grasp ; the child spun off balance , fell against the side of the building and stood up , smiling . Before Rainey could turn again , a woman had come out of the house and was standing before him bristling.  | " What you doin ' them childr'n ? They ai n't hurtin ' you . This a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " There was a crowd in no time at all ; women in housedresses from the adjoining houses , old men in striped suspenders , a tall drunken man in a yachting cap  --  fifteen or twenty people had suddenly ringed him in . " Yeah , what you doin ' them children ? " The children disappeared down an overgrown driveway between two wooden houses . " What you want to hurt them children for , sub , " one of the men from the Elite Bar asked him . " Yeah , why you want to do that , daddy ? " " Hey do n't do that . " Rainey looked over the crowd and saw Matthew Arnold peeringfearfully from the window of his car . He had slowed in midstreetwithout parking . " No one 's hurting any children , " Rainey made himself say . " You 're mistaken . " Clutching the portfolios , he started through the crowd . There was a moment 's shifting hesitation , he saw a woman 's hand at his sleeve , he stepped quickly over someone 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and the car ; he walked on . The men glared at him and at the last minute parted to let him pass . The crowd was behind him now but their voices grew louder . Matthew Arnold sat palefaced at the wheel of his car ; for a moment Rainey thought he would not open the door . He was staring straight ahead through the windshield . Rainey went around to the passenger side , and Arnold let him in . The men from the Elite had followed closely all the way . " Lock it , lock it , goddamn you , " Matthew Arnold said , ramminginto gear . " Lock it . " The men from the Elite were crowding close outside . Rainey , numb , looked out to meet their eyes . " Hey lookit this man ! " " Hey lookit this fool ! "  | " Hey lookit this long tall sally ! " " Hey where you go , long tall sally ? " They were almost to the corner when the first beer can cracked against the rear windshield and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five when he let himself through his own patio and gate and went upstairs . The heat of the afternoon had not lifted and it was only a little cooler in the green gloom of the closed courtyard . Rainey went into his apartment , removed his suit jacket and made himself a glass of iced tea . From the street came the creakingof a strawberry wagon , the plodding hoofbeats of a drayhorse and the flatted voice of a vendor calling : " Traw  --  beer  --  ies . . . Dey fresh . . . ' Trawberries . . . . " He went in to take a shower , dried himself and changed his clothes . He had a box of frozen chicken legs in the refrigerator for dinner that night , but he decided against them because of the heat . He took a can of soup and some biscuits instead . When he had finished and washed the dishes , he went out and sat on the balcony for a while in the cooling dusk . For the first time since he had gotten out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to tremble . The faces outside the window had never left saw them again , heard the shrilling women , the cool chanted menace of the men walking behind him . He sat motionless in his chair on the dark balcony while the voices welled up inside him until he heard them shrieking and echoing in the still street below . He stood up , trembling more now , and went inside . When he was a boy , he had heard things . . . voices in the pine wind , when he listened , in the soft rush of water , in the Gulf laving stone and driftwood at the river mouth . Then , when the storm had come in the autumn after his father 's death , Ile had lain for days in fever within the shuddering house while allp219the visions feared of the day before , the dread procession of God 's stricken world broke over him without mercy . In all those days , sights he could not blot away rose again and again before him  --  voices roared from that wind , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice of God , had broken , grown distant and fallen away before a terrible maimed chorus , the millionthroatedhowl of a Godless earth , transfixed with note , with death , with darkness . Morgan Rainey , fists clenched at his sides , walked to his writingdesk switched on the light and took down the schoolboy 's copy book where he had begun shortly before to keep his journal . He marked the date  --  April 16 , 1963 and wrote : Today  --  Back of Town  --  I came away feeling broken . . He paused , put the pen aside and went quickly out to the balconyagain ; in swelling rage , the voice cried up from the stones at him . He went inside and sat down on the bed . In the second drawer of his night dresser he had a bottle of sleeping pills ; he preferred not to take them unless he felt it necessary . He sat on the bed for a while , hearing the voices fall distant , then closer as the wind rose ; words formed in his mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but looking outside he could see curtainsin a window across the way stir languidly on the faintest of breezes . Voices rode on the roaring wind , softened as it passed over him . He went to the bathroom , drew a glass of water and took the pill bottle from his drawer . About to turn off the light , he hesitated . He reached out and took the nearest book within reach from his dresser ; it was the Gita , the copy that Joan Herzen had given him the night he left for Venezuela and the Friend 's ServiceCommittee . He opened it and turned to the transfigurationof Krishna , God 's self-litany in the war chariot . He found it and began to read , the wind voices rising again . He read the Litany :  |p220I  am the Man-Consumer , spewer of skulls I am the cunning of Dice Play I am Time , waster of the PeoplesThe wind filled him , lifted him , the voices shouted round him . He put the book down , took two of the tablets and switched off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back of Town came to him , the dark running legs of children , the brute 's mask of Wormwood Puckett , the dull hating eyes , the fiery roofs of the sheds in the railroad yards . And then the streets of Puerto Moreno , burning oil , the same tin roofs , the children , shrilling voices . He felt again as though rising , rising on the wind that pursued him  --  while stretched out before him , horizon to horizon , across the earth a whirling mass of human flesh churned in darkness ; from it , hands grasped the air , and bright tortured eyes looked out in hate and terror . The mass rolled , the hands reached to cling but there was only other flesh ; the flesh gave , rent , bled and cried out  --  and the harder the desperate hands strove to cling , the greater was the yielding , the agonized yielding , the ripping of sinew , as the mass rolled over and over , sky to sky . The wind died , the voices quieted . Night settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that just the darkness came , he saw light , the headlights of a car , so bright that he could see the dull brown wings of night moths , clinging to dry branches , and the green of summer grass . But he went to sleep then . On the first day of May , Rheinhardt and Geraldine went to Pontchartrain Beach with a transistor radio and a gallon of wine . After they had been on the beach for an hour or so and Rhein liardt had cursed the lake for its stillness , a storm came up very quickly from the marshes . The water turned black , reflecting the sky 's swollen thunderheads and rolled up on the sand in swill ) , whitecaps . No rain came , but the wind mounted until the airp221was brittle with dust and sand . Rheinhardt and Geraldine took their wine and went into a glass and plastic hot dog stand to watch the beach blow about . Other people wandered in on the wind  --  a little roundbelliednavy medic , a teen-aged couple in matching purple shirts . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture windows at the storm . Behind the counter , a Greek was stacking cartons of cigarettes one by one in a wire tray . He worked as though he were piling bricks , squinting over the fumes of a cigarette that burned in the corner of his yellowed lips . Each time he dropped a carton into place he would say quietly : " LS  --  MFI ' . LS  --  MF'l ' . " " What 's mean ? " he asked Geraldine , arching a gray eyebrow flirtatiously  --  " LS  --  MFT ? " " Lucky Strike Means Fine Taste , " Geraldine said soberly . " Lucky Strike Means Fine Tobacco , " the sailor corrected . " Yah , " the Greek said and went on laboriously piling up theboxes . " LS  --  MFT . LS  --  MFT . " The teen-agers exchanged looks to signify that everyone there was crazy . The Greek continued his maniacal stacking . " LS  --  MFT . " " You should have been a priest , " Rheinhardt told him after a while . " Priest ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the cigarette out of his mouth and laughed insanely , watching Rheinhardt with I Icllenic caution . " Make more money , " he said , and replaced the cigarette . " Hey , you think I look like a priest ? " " You do n't have a beard , " Rheinhardt said . " But you have something . " " Why ? " the Greek asked . " You Greek ? " " Serb , " Rheinhardt said . " My father was a priest . " " How about that ? " the Greek said and dropped the last carton into place . " Yeah , " Rheinhardt said . " ' Would you like some wine ? " Geraldine looked at him and shook her head.  | " You 'll have to pardon him , " she told the teen-agers . " He just got out of the Crazy Soldiers and Sailors Home . " " I do n't drink wine , " the Greek said . The navy corpsman pushed his stool closer . " Hey , you can give me some of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek said . " I do n't care if there 's no cops . If one comes I holler and get you put in jail . " " Agreed , " Rheinhardt said . The corpsman poured wine into his soda cup and drank it . The teen-agers looked on with amused detachment . No one gave them any wine . " Well , " Rheinhardt said . " To the Eucharist under two forms . " " That 's one you never hear , " the corpsman said . He did not drink directly from the bottle , but poured his next shot into the cup again . Outside , it grew dark and the wind rose ever higher ; the plastic structure shivered as the gale whistled beneath it . In spite of the storm , the lights of the amusement park had been turned on . Colored electric lights around the concessions shook like windtossedfruit . " Hey ! " Geraldine said . " There 's John . " A cop was striving up the promenade , clutching a slicker about himself . The sailor drained his cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping bag . He threw a bill on the counter and grabbed Geraldine by the arm . " Let 's escape , " he told her . They ran out into the wind , across the promenade and over the worried sand ; the wind was behind them . Rheinhardt era died the wine bag like a football . He was not a runner and Geraldineeasily outdistanced him ; he pursued her wearily , wing sloshing in his innards as in the bottle and marveled at the grace and assurance with which her long strong legs assaulted turf and air . His chest ached and he stopped breathless . At the edge of the beach , a wooden walk extended over ap223length of breakwater . Rheinhardt saw Geraldine climb up the dark stones and scale the railing to run into groaning darkness over the water . Walking now , he followed the mooring ; at the end of the breakwater was a white light and he could see Geraldine'srunning figure far ahead of him , darting in and out of its arc . When he reached the end of the woodwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rocks again and was stretched out in a hollow in the lee of the breakwater . " No wind where I am , " she called to Rheinhardt . He climbed over the rail and sat down on the rocks beside her . The spot was almost completely out of the wind , a pocket in the roaring night . Rheinhardt put his arm around her and they passed the bottle between them without speaking . Geraldine set their radio on the flat stones by her feet ; they did not turn it on . " You 're really crazy , Rheinhardt , " Geraldine said , " honest to God . Like what 's a Serb ? " " Serbs are foreigners from Serbia . They have Serbs in West Virginia . " " Rheinhardt , you 're gon na be around for a while , are n't you ? " " Sure , " Rheinhardt said . " I do n't ask questions like that , you know , " Geraldine assured him . " I know it do n't mean nothin ' . I know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " Rheinhardt said . He got her started singing hymns and sang with her  --  " LeaningOn the Everlasting Arm , " " Let Us All Gather By the River , " " When I Die I 'll Live Again . " Geraldine sang them with great reluctance and only when drunk . " They scare the shit out of me , " Geraldine said . " I do n't think it 's fun to sing them . " " I like to sing with you , " Rheinhardt told her . " And if you did n't like to sing them I could n't make you . " They sang " On the Banks of the O-hio , " which Rheinhardtp224had taught her  --  they sang it again , and then , at the top of their voices they sang " I love mountain music , real old mountain music , played by a real hillbilly band . " " You got some kind of talent , " Rheinhardt told Geraldine . " If you were n't such a hick you could be a real American au-thentic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a cold wind . It tasted like a landswell , Rheinhardt thought , there was no sea , no brine in it . Geraldine began to get very drunk . " I do n't want to live forever , " she told Rheinhardt . " I do n't want anything . I do n't have any desires . " " That 's the way to be , " Rheinhardt said . " You gon na be around a while ai n't you , Rheinhardt ? " " Sure . " " I do n't ask questions like that . I do n't , do I , buddy ? " " No . " " Does your wife drink , Rheinhardt ? " " Yeah , " Rheinhardt said . " She drinks . " " Is she fuckin ' other people ? " " She drinks and she fucks other people . " " What right you got to blame her though ? You ai n't there . " " I do n't blame her . She did n't fuck other people when I was there . She did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart as you . " " No , " Rheinhardt said . " But she 's very smart . She 's nicer than me . " " That do n't make no difference to me , " Geraldine said . " There 's only one thing I do n't like and that 's being tired . " Slit reached under the rocks and brought up a handful of clay flecked sand , holding it under her chin in a cupped hand . " It 's like eating sand . " Rheinhardt swatted her hand down and sent the sand fluming out into the darkness . The water on the rocks below them was rising.  | " Oh , Rheinhardt , " Geraldine said , " you know why I love you is you 're so far out . You 're so wild and you do n't have nothing to do with anythin ' . " " That 's not completely true , " Rheinhardt said . " I 'd really like you to be around for a while because after you 're not , it 'll be just like eating sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Honestly , it 'll be shitty when you 're not around . " " What do you want me to say ? " " I just want you to realize that is all . " " You 're trying to give me a hard time , " Rheinhardt said . " Do n't holler before you 're hurt . " " But I need you , love , " she said . " I really do . " " You must be out of your mind , " Rheinhardt told her . " I do n't say things like that to you , why do you say them to me ? Man , that 's an obscenity  --  " He raised his hand and made a claw of it , clutching at the wind  --  " I need you ! If somebody ever tells you , Geraldine , that they need you , you tell them to buy a dog . " " Oh , God , " Geraldine said , " it ai n't like that . You do n't even know what I mean . You  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held his and clutched the air where he had and lowered the hand still twisted to his shoulder . " I swear to God I 'd never do you that way . I mean that I love you , Rheinhardt , because you 're a flyer . You 're up on the air . I 'd never do you that way . " She leaned forward , trying to see his face . " Man , " she told him , " I 've been eating sand . I been dragged and you 're up on the air to me and I want to be up there too . I want to be a flyer too . I want to be with you because you 're so groovy , Rheinhardt , and I love you so much . I 'm scared that 's what I mean . That 's all I mean . " " I have this thing , " Rheinhardt said , " about need . " " I know it 's a hang up . I ca n't help it . I . . . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rheinhardt said , " we have to consider my needs . We have to consider them from every possible angle inp226every minute detail and we have to work tirelessly to gratify them all . That 's going to take so much time and we 'll be so busy that we wo n't even have to think about your needs at all . " " That 's right , " Geraldine said . " That 'll work for a while . You got a lot of needs all right . They 're great too . I just know it . " " They 're sublime needs . " He propped his back up against the rock and shouted at the lake . " I 'm a person of sublime needs . " He raised a limp wrist to his forehead and pressed his brow with the back of his hand . " Hell yes , " Geraldine said . " You 're sick , you 're nervous , you 're a drunk , you 're cowardly , you 're a mouthoff . . . " " Bullshit , " Rheinhardt said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's a put down . " " I 'm just tryin ' to help out . " " I did n't come here to be insulted , " Rheinhardt said . " I 'm going to hurl myself into the sea . " " You ? You 're a chickenshit . You wo n't do it . " " Are you kidding ? " Rheinhardt said . " Nobody is more selfdestructivethan me . I 'll jump off any rock anywhere . " " You 'll never do it , " Geraldine said . She stood and pulled her white cotton jumper over her head , stripping down to her bathing suit . " But I will , by God . I 'm more destructive than you . " You 're drunk , " Rheinhardt said . " You ca n't even swim . " " The hell I ca n't . " " You 're batshit . You 're trying to kill me because I wo n't swear undying love or something . " " I 'm gon na jump off , " Geraldine said . Rheinhardt looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , man , " he said . " Do n't act like a silly bitch . " " You 're chicken . " " Listen , Wonderwoman , you put one scrawny toe in that shit and I 'm going right up there to the taxi stand and I 'm leaving you to the alligators . " He looked at the water again . " Honestly , man , there are alligators in there . " " Sharks , not alligators. "  | " You 're drunk . " " So what ? " " Wait , " Rheinhardt said . Trying to stall her while he contrived to meet the situation , Rheinhardt absently removed his shoes and socks and then his shirt and trousers , until he found himself standing in the baggy boxing trunks he had stolen from the gym of some railroad YMCA . " You 're nuts ! " he told her in despair . " You 're trying to murderme . " He picked up his shoes and began climbing back toward the footwalk . " Go find a lover 's leap , you nitwit ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geraldine rolled over the rock on her stomach and slid , with curious grace into the darkness . He could not hear a splash for the wind . Rheinhardt watched her go and tried to clear his head . " You 're mad , " he said to the deserted breakwater . He put his clothes down in the cleft of a rock and looked over the water . The amusement park lights had gone out along the beach front ; he could see only the row of white lights that lined the lake wall . In their feeble rays , he made out Geraldine splashingalong , almost halfway in . His skin tight with loathing , Rheinhardt jumped into darkness and was swallowed in the warm churning water . He surfaced spitting ; his feet had slid along the slime bottom up-ending him . He tried to turn over , missed a breath and sank again ; his head felt swollen , his guts ached , his mouth tasted rankly of the afternoon'swine . Completely out of control , he bobbed on the rising surf , unable to get his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rheinhardt was overcome with rage and fear , he flapped like a bog-trapped antelope until with the wind behind him and the strength of panic he found his footing and was able to trudge along through tepid , waist-deep water . From the line of lights ahead , he seemed to be about two miles offshore . He walked for a while ; something cold and alive scurried over his foot and he leaped in the air with a cry of " Shit " and stumbled on , retching ,  |p228coughing  and leg weary to the shore . He sat down on the soft sand , the wind peppering him , and looked at the water . Geraldine came walking grandly down the beach as though she had run over from St. Tropez for the evening . " Hello , Easily Led . " Rheinhardt looked up at her in deep annoyance . " I swear you 're a scream , " she said . " I got you to jump off the rock . Imagine little old me getting smart old you to jump into Lake Pontchartrain . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This chick is going to kill me , " he cautioned himself . " You tried to murder me tonight , " he said . " You tried to drown me out of capricious female malice . " " No such , " Geraldine said . " You jumped off the rock because you 're such a crazy boy . You were afraid I was gon na be more self-destructive than what you were . " " I got your number now , " Rheinhardt said . " You 're a man-killer . " " What 's the matter , love , " Geraldine said soothingly , " did some beautiful sexy thing make you blow your cool ? " She wag. gled her behind at him . " That lake tastes like fried oyster grease . It ought to be cementedover . " " Well you ca n't say I never messed you up , smart mouth , " Geraldine said with satisfaction . " Of course that was n't hardly a swim . " " More of a walk , " Rheinhardt said . They went and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach to the road . Rheinhardt phoned for a cab and they rode home , wet and sandy , in silence . As they went through the patio gate , the cab driver discovered his soaked and sanded back seat and cursed them . They walked slowly upstairs as his curses and the sound of his engine died away and went into the apartment . Geraldine had a shower . Rheinhardt turned the radio on to wwED . They were playing " Eine Kleine Nachtmusik " withp229Beecham ; Rheinhardt paused in the act of twisting the dial and let it play . He brought the bourbon bottle in from the kitchen and sat holding it in his lap , listening . In the shower , Geraldine hummed hymns to herself . Rheinhardt drank , thought of himself wallowing in the lake , and laughed . " The chick is going to kill me , " he said aloud . He thought about that for a while . Yes , he considered there was a distinct possibility of that . How stupid , he thought . But as a concept it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assassination , Rheinhardtwondered , aesthetics or moral satisfaction ? Aesthetics toujours ! The idea of Geraldine murdering him was stupid enough to be morally satisfying . But suppose she put ant phosphorous in the chili ; that would not be beautiful . Aestheticswere out . So back to moral considerations which lead us to consider  --  justice . If she soaked the chili with ant phosphorous would it be just ? He was unable to reach an ethical conclusion . The only real satisfaction in his being murdered by Geraldine , Rheinhardt thought , lay in the realm of the perverse . Now that 's where I really live , he told himself , that 's where my heart 's balm flows . Perversion resolves what any number of other things can not . Perversion is what makes the world , as they say , go round . He took another drink from the bottle and thought for a moment of his wife . As victims went there was no competing with her . That 's what did it , he thought , there we were shoving each other to keep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good strong woman with a talent for suffering . What a virtuous chick , he thought . Geraldine came out of the shower wearing white pants andstood in front of him ; he looked at her and put the bottle down . Her skin was chafed from sand and water . Rheinhardt slippedhis arm leisurely about her wide hips and pulled the pants offp230guiding them to her ankles . Geraldine had a cigarette burn on the right side of her stomach ; Rheinhardt ran his finger over her skin and touched it . " They burned you too , did they ? " " Naw , " Geraldine said . " Everything that lies around in the places I do gets cigarette burns on it  --  the beds , the tables , you know . Some John left without his cigarette . I used to fall asleep real easy in those days  --  just bang , like that . Fella leaned his smoke on me and left without it . " " You been ill used . You 're a salamander . " " Why 's that ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you live on air . " Geraldine closed her eyes . " I wish , " she said . He put his face beside the tender blond hair of her groin and brought her down on the bed to him . In his drunkenness , it seemed to him that she was some creature of lakes , of brack and still water ; he moved his lips over her body that was freshly cleaned from the bath and savored on it the deliciousness of his own death and hers , the commanding power of the wheel on which all flesh broke . He sounded all the quarters of her flesh ; his wrist in the cleft of her buttocks he brought her on to him , tasting in her mouth the thrills of destruction and unmaking . In this delirium , he made love to her past the very dead of night until she could do no more than cling to him in silent laughter and the last spasm of his waking nerves had been smashed against her flesh . " Mr. Rainey , " Lester Clotho told Morgan Rainey one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good health . " " I 'm all right , " Rainey said . But in fact he had not been well . He had a cough that persisted through the hottest days and made it difficult for him to speak . He was also becoming veryp231forgetful and frequently misplaced survey materials , and in the last few weeks he had been having some trouble with his eyes . " Really , " Lester said , " go ahead and describe your symptoms to me . I 've got a certain competence in medical practices . " " Cold , " Rainey said . " In the bowels , Mr. Rainey , or in the extremities ? You see ... " " I have a cold . I think it 's mainly in my head . " They were in the kitchen of Lester 's cafe . Beyond the fastenedshutters , a fiery afternoon threw hot fingers of sunlight across the darkness of the oily room . " A cold in summer is a burden and a danger , " Mr. Clotho explained . " If it lodges in the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meningeal tissues . " Rainey turned away and leafed through his charts . Mr. Clotho shook his head . " I hate to see concerned young people throw their health away . " Yes , " Rainey said . " What you been up to , by the by ? I 've seen you wendin ' your very weary way here , there and all around . You 're a fixture of the area . You 've gained acceptance , as we say . " " I have n't been doing anything . I go to see people and I ask the questions on the sheet . I 'm a clerk . " " A clerk  --  yet more than a clerk , Mr. Rainey . Why whenever I find out where you 've been I always hear complimentary words about you . " " Look , " Rainey said , " I meant to do it earlier but I finally went to the Federal building about this fellow Hoskins and I 've got some forms for him . Can he read ? " " He was in the Army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fine . Let 's go see him . " " He 's gone , " Mr. Clotho said . " He went out to cash his check on Tuesday and never came back . I felt compelled to rent his room the other day . " " Oh , " Morgan Rainey . His head tilted to one side and hisp232chin jerked quickly toward his shoulder . It was an involuntary mannerism he had developed after his illness but had always been able to suppress with some difficulty . " Well . . . the police . . . ? " " Ah , " Mr. Clotho said . " I 'm not the sort of person who goes to police stations . Myself , I do n't believe in mysterious happenings . I 'm sure that there 's a perfectly logical series of events connected with his so-called disappearance . " Rainey did not answer . After a few moments he suggested that they go upstairs because it was really quite dark in the kitchen with the shutters drawn . They went out , passing briefly into the full fury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs . " I do n't have my key today , " Rainey confessed . " I 'd be obliged if you 'll show me which of the third floor tenants are welfare clients . " Mr. Clotho did an impression of servile enthusiasm . " Yes , suh ! " he exclaimed . " Yassuh . " They went up another flight of stairs and down the red corridorof the third floor to the first door on the left . Rainey knocked . " Whoa ! " a voice inside said . Mr. Clotho inserted himself between Morgan and the door . " Big Gene , " he said . " It 's Lester . " A man in an undershirt opened the door , saw Clotho , and stepped back . The room was dark . The man turned his back to the door and lighted a lamp . FollowingClotho inside , Rainey suddenly encountered himself in the oversized mirror on the dresser . The man who had opened the door was also looking into the mirror and , seeing Rainey , he froze in his tracks like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a man of about thirty with two pink scars graven on the stubble of his cheek . Rainey became acutely conscious of the whiteness of his own face in the glass.  |p233The  tenant stood with his back to them , crouching slightly , with his hands crossed in front of him . " Clotho . . . " he said , without turning around . " Clotho . . . man . " " Cool it , " Mr. Clotho said . " You just cool it , Big Gene . " Big Gene sat down on the bed with his sinewy brown arm restingloosely across the pillow . " This man is from the city , Big Gene . He gets to see all our guests because this establishment works with the city . Rainey , this is Jones . Ask him anything . " Morgan Rainey was a minute or two drawing his survey materialsfrom the portfolio ; Big Gene and Lester Clotho looked at each other without speaking . " Well then , " Rainey said , " Mr. Jones , how much public assistanceare you receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time with expressionless eyes , and turned his gaze back to Clotho . " Are n't you receiving public assistance ? " " Why no , " Big Gene said softly with strange good humor . " Why no , I ai n't . " Mr. Clotho smiled at Big Gene benignly . Rainey put his pencil away and replaced the charts . " I see , " he said , " I 'm sorry to have bothered you . " " Sure , " Big Gene said . " Yes sir . " Mr. Clotho was chuckling as they went out . " Oho that Jones is a caution . He must of thought we were playing a joke on him . " " See here , " Rainey said . " Now you see here  --  I ' only want to see the people who are getting benefits . I have no reason to see anyone else . " " Mr. Rainey , " Mr. Clotho said . " Try to understand that your whole mission 's success rests on mutual trust and cooperation . I had business with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimal fee because he 's a relative  --  and I like to impress all my charges with the fine official relations I maintain . "  | " I do n't want to see anyone I do n't have to see . " " Ah , " Clotho said , " now I perceive more clearly . " He whistledthrough his teeth and began to sing : " Retreat , retreat cried my heart  --  Is your heart calling retreat , Mr. Rainey ? Do you feel the need to disengage at this late date ? " " Clotho , " Rainey said . " That 's drivel . " Clotho shrugged and walked on down the corridor . " I do n't mind your saying that . A man in my position is very sensitive to nuances of an unkind word and I think that 's a very qualitative insult  --  yessuh , it 's the kind of insult that might pass between two people of culture . It 's almost a backhand corn-pliment . " " All right . I have interviews to conduct . " " Indeed you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured him . They stopped before another door , and Rainey saw that pinned to it was a piece of bright paper that had apparently been cut from the leader of a Sunday comic strip . " Holly , " the little pinning read  --  in varicolored block letters ; under the letters was the grinning face of a blond cartoon cutie which had been shaded over with a pencil to darken it . Rainey knocked at the door , Mr. Clotho stepped in front of him . A young man with a pointed face that was larded to masklike density with pancake make-up peered out . " Hello , clear , " Lester Clotho said , pursing his lips . " Why Lester , " the youth said , " whatever 's on your mind ? " When he saw Rainey , his smile vanished and he withdrew from the doorway as though struck . " Do n't run away , child , " Clotho called to him . " Just a little official business to conduct . " He pushed the door open and went in , Rainey following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jockey shorts ; as Clotho and Rainey entered he was pulling a red print kimono over his shanks , folding it down primly at the skirts . He stood inp235one corner of the room , before a dresser papered with dime-store photographs of movie stars and watched them fearfully . " Mr. Rainey , " Lester Clotho said , " may I present Mr. Rainey . " " Yes . . . yessuh . . . " the youth stammered ; he seemed too frightened to speak . " Rainey ? " Morgan Rainey asked . " Yeah , " Clotho said . " That 's right . C'm on , Hollywood , get straight , " he told the young man . " We 're all scared of the man . This gentleman is n't the coarser sort of white person , child , he 's a social worker on a special humanitarian assignment . " " Oh , " the youth said . He relaxed so quickly that it seemed to Morgan Rainey that there had been something spurious about the intensity of his fear . But in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former fearful sobriety . " I just want a little information , " Morgan Rainey said , clearinghis throat . " Now what 's your full name ? " " Robert Lee Rainey . " " They call him Hollywood , " Clotho said . " My name , " Rainey said absently , " is Rainey too . " The young man 's features broke into a wild total smile and his eyes rolled beneath the green shadow that adorned them . The smile faded at once . He looked at Rainey as though he might laugh or cry with equal likelihood at the next exchange . " What sort of welfare benefits are receiving ? " " He 's receiving his sister 's welfare benefits , " Mr. Clotho said softly . Hollywood looked at Mr. Clotho in open-mouthed suprise . " Why , you see , " he said swallowing , " they send me her benefitsbecause I manages her business affairs . " " Does n't she have to sign for them ? " " He signs for them , " Clotho said . Hollywood Rainey began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign for them , " he said very slowly , " yes , uh that 's correct . I act as her powerful attorney . "  | " You sign for them ? And do you cash them ? They 're made out to her , are n't they ? " " I use powerful attorney , " the youth said desperately . " Power of attorney , sweetie , " Mr. Clotho said . " A powerful attorney is what you need when you get caught cheating the wel-fares . " " How can you cash them if she does n't sign them ? " " Uh , " Hollywood Rainey said with a shrug , " Ah jes ba doorebaand then , why you know . " " Bless your heart , " Mr. Clotho said . " Why he signs them . And he cashes them too . He 's an expert female impersonator  --  just as pretty as a picture . " " Bitch , " Hollywood Rainey said to Clotho . " I 'll cut you , you bitch motherfucker . " Morgan Rainey sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm gon na remember you said that , " Lester Clotho said . " It 's a lie , Mr. , " Hollywood told Rainey . " I mean I can explainthis quite simply . " They waited in silence for a moment . " Oh , you fat bitch , " Hollywood said . " Well , " Morgan Rainey said , " you 're in trouble over this . I do n't see any way around it . " " My sister does n't need money , " Hollywood said bitterly . " She has men . " " So do you , " Clotho said . " Niggers , " Hollywood said . " Cottonpickers . " " I thought you had a boy who worked in the library , " Mr. Clotho asked solicitously . " Leave me alone , you damn fag . If you was wanting me to leave Clotho , God knows you could have said something . You did n't have to run to them with lies . " " You have too many problems for a young person . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer your case to a kindly profes-sional. "  | " I have to report it , " Rainey said . " I mean , it 's a very serious violation . " Hollywood Rainey tugged at the hem of his kimono . " My sister does n't care . She has everything she needs . Everybody'sbeen very happy with things going this way . " " You sign the checks , " Rainey asked , rubbing his forehead , " and then you go and cash them wearing women 's clothes ? " Hollywood shrugged . " The man cashes the check because he knows it 's good , " Clotho explained . " He does n't trouble himself to trouble himself to look at people . He makes ten cents on the dollar . " " I got some looks , " Hollywood said , " and they was n't suspiciousones either . " " Do you wear women 's clothes all the time ? " Rainey asked . Hollywood Rainey looked at him without answering . " How old are you ? " " Twenty-five . " " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hollywood Rainey said . He watched Morganfrom the corners of his eyes , showing the barest shadow of a sneer . " Do you have any family living ? " " My wife , " Hollywood said with an unpleasant smile . " And my son that 's eight years old . They live downstate . " Morgan looked at him in surprise . " But . . . " He let the question go . " Why did you come up to the city ? " " For freedom , " Hollywood Rainey said . " Greater freedom . " " Where are you from downstate ? " " Pass Royaume , " Hollywood Rainey said . Morgan stared at him for such a long time that he grew nervous , fidgeted in his chair , wiggled his shoulders impatiently , smiled a brilliant momentary false smile , and began to bite his fingernails.  | " I . . . uh . . . " Morgan Rainey began , " I 'm from there . . from Pass Royaume too . " Morgan and Hollywood Rainey looked at opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At last Morgan got up and went quickly to the door . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I do n't know . . . about this . " Mr. Clotho came out behind him , smiling . When they were out in the corridor they heard a moan and the smashing of crockery from behind Hollywood 's door . " Hollywood , you better not do any damage in there , " Mr. Clotho called . In the next room , they watched a blind old man fondle a rusted telescope . " He mean the river under the river , " the old man was saying . " Under that river there 's a jewel box . Any truck that stop by know the jewel box is there . You remember there was a all girl or-chester was all girls  --  to play the fiddle played the trombone everythin ' like that . Heh heh . Yeller pussy 's what it was . " He was short and very thin with a completely bald head , light brown and freckled , blind from glaucoma . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he paused and put it to his eye . The lenses were rusted over at both ends . " Red right returning , " the old man went on , " the blinker was a shoal . Keel went plumb over it . You know . Skittery 's what it was . That old Dutchman did n't know . He live by himself over there . The trucks stop by the blinker  --  they know . Gut shot him spilled that whisky . Goddamn you see ' em dance . " He looked into the telescope . " Uh uh . Only one man got a flyin ' fish on his watch chain . " Morgan Rainey got up from the folding chair on which he had been seated . " All right , " he said quietly . " All right . " " You tell it , Beaver , " Mr. Clotho said to the old man . " We 'll be seeing you . " " Next time I deal , Lewis , " Beaver said . " He do n't know whether it factory or it ain't. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Beaver 's vital statistics for you , " Mr. Clotho said when they were in the hall . " But I know they 're all down in my records . I 'll be sure to have them when we next have the pleasure . " " Yes , " Rainey said . " Ah , " Clotho sighed reflectively , " I look out for them all , Mr. Rainey . Maybe nobody else cares , but my eye is on them all . " " I think , " Rainey said , " that I 'm going to stop for today . " They went downstairs and through the kitchen , where Clotho'sold pullman porter was washing a bowl of lake crabs in the deep-sink . In the cafe , at a table near the wall , a young Negro was overseeinga bottle of bourbon and a shot glass which were set before him . He wore dark glasses with round frames and a white straw hat that was tilted forward so that the brim touched the tops of his shades . From time to time , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands and hum . As Mr. Clotho guided Rainey past , the young man raised his shot glass in salute . " If anybody ask you who I am , " he sang to Mr. Clotho , " tell them I 'm a child of God . " " Good afternoon , Roosevelt , " Mr. Clotho said cheerfully . " Are you depriving the outspoken colored press of your talents today ? " " Outspoken colored press gives me Wednesday off , uncle , " the young man said . " I commune with my souly soul . " Morgan Rainey walked up absentmindedly and stood beside Clotho ; the young man turned his chair to face in another direction . " Mr. Rainey , let me present Roosevelt Berry of the Delta Advance , an unafraid colored newspaper . And Roosevelt , this is Mr. Rainey . " He lowered his voice a tone . " Just between us , Mr. Rainey is one of those concerned young white persons who would walk through fire and water for the Negro race . " " Charmed , " Berry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to favor us with a new goatee ? Your last one was very debonair . " " I got one in my pocket all the time , " Roosevelt Berry said . " Roosevelt lost his last goatee in an amusing way , " Mr. Clotho told Rainey . " He had a pretty little girlfriend over across the state line and he just had to go up there all the time to see her . One night he ran afoul of a deputy sheriff , and that officer and his friends shaved off poor Roosevelt 's goatee with a hunting knife . " " But do you think I minded ? " Berry said . " I did n't mind . I did n't want that hairy little fool anyway . There 's a lot of bitternessaround but I do n't let it get to me . Like some cats would go home and brood about taking that motherfucker 's knife and scraping off his cracker pig 's face with it . But not me . " " Yes , they 're so conservative in the countryside , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Christian view of things . He probably thinks a lot like you , Mr. Rainey . " " Why do n't you leave the gentleman alone , Lester ? " Berry said . " Why do n't you leave all the gentlemen alone ? " " Well , " Mr. Clotho said , " I have people to see . I look forward to our next visitation , Mr. R. " He brushed the shoulders of his suit , nodded pleasantly and strolled out the front door . Rainey started after him , but paused at the doorway . Out on the broiling sidewalk , a Sno-Ball vendor bent to his wagon , a green clerk 's eyeshade filmed with the sweat of his forehead . Rainey went back to the table where Roosevelt Berry was drinking . " You work for the Delta Advance ? " Rainey asked . " Is that right ? " Berry looked at him silently , masked by the shades and the brim of his hat . " Mr. Clotho said you worked for the Delta Advance , Mr. Berry . Is that right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are some things I 'm trying to make sense out of , "  |p241Rainey  told him . " I thought that the work I 've been doing might be a little more . . . effective , you see , if I could talk to someone . . . " There are plenty of people to talk to out in the street , " Berry said . They make a business of providing information for you all . I 'm not in that line . " " I do n't want information exactly . I 'm sort of trying to find out where I 'm at . " Berry looked at him from behind the hat and shade complex and made a hissing noise with his teeth . " Sure I guess any man who 's ready to walk on water for the Negro race should get a drink . You want a drink , cousin ? " " Thank you , " Rainey said . He did not at all want a drink . " How we gon na get you a drink though . You ca n't sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to give you one and you 'll have to drink it standing up . Otherwise I 'll have to give you my chair and stand up while you drink my whisky . Hey , pops , " he called to the kitchen man " what we gon na do about this gentleman ? How 's he gon na get a drink ? " " You think he 'd know to go , " the old porter said softly . Rainey took a chair from the next table . " It 's not against the law at the moment , " he said . He set his rainhat down on the plastic tablecloth . " Pops , " Berry called . The porter brought a glass and set it down beside Rainey 's hat . Rainey poured out a finger of bourbon from the bottle . " Where are you from ? " Berry asked him . " You some sort of a preacher ? " " No , no , " Rainey said . He felt his neck jerk to one side in the throes of his mannerism . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've been at it quite a while now . " " Jesus Christ , " Roosevelt Berry said , " you work for that ? But that 's too much . " He took his sunglasses off and regarded Rainey with a broad drunken grin . " That 's the end . " He poured himself another drink , shook his head , and began to laugh . Eachp242time he looked up at Rainey and tried to speak he would be overcomeby a fit of laughter . " Well what you want with me ? " he asked when he had regained control . " I ai n't on welfare . " " I used to do service work , " Rainey said , trying to explain . " Overseas . I wanted to get back with . . . the people . I had n't worked in a while . I 've been sick a lot . It was the only thing I could get that might . . . help . " " Oh boy , " Roosevelt Berry said . " Oh boy . Things get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . " They do n't get any better , dig , but they sure as hell do get funnier . " " I 'm in some sort of bind , " Rainey said desperately . " I do n't know what 's going on . I do n't know what 's expected of me . The survey people keep referring me back to Clotho . " " That 's natural . " " But why ? Why is it natural ? He 's fighting me . I ca n't get anything straight from him . " " Man , you got a weird idea of what help means . What do you reckon you could be doing on that damn survey that Lester wo n't let you do ? " " I do n't know , " Rainey said . Slowly , he lifted his glass and took a sip of the whisky . " I 'm not what you call an outgoing person . I turn in . . . on myself . I wanted to get back and I had to start somewhere . And it seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way to fight it . I 'm not for the system here . I 'm against it . I always have been . Always . " Roosevelt Berry shifted his hat to the back of his head . " Oh boy , " he said . " You 're too much . You 're a bomb , baby . Lester must dig havin ' you around . " " Berry ! What is it ? What ? Who 's Clotho ? What has he got to do with this survey ? " Rainey 's eyes ached from the whisky . " What 's going on ? " " You want to know what 's goin ' on , huh , Mr. Help-Out . Well suppose I put it to you this way . Let me say that our little community is a cultural and political dependency of the white metropolis , and that for some reason which is undoubtedly in the Bible the said white metropolis does n't regard us too well . Ip243mean , I hate to be the one to tell you this , mister , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . " " Berry , for God 's sake . Talk straight . " " Man , do n't you tell me talk straight . That 's a straighter answerthan you deserve . Tell you the truth I do n't like your face . I do n't like you . " " That does n't matter to me , " Rainey said . " Why shit , " Berry said , looking about him . " You sit there drinkin ' my whisky in the middle of Lester 's place and you say nobody treatin ' you right and what 's goin on ? What the hell you think is always goin ' on ? Shit , man , you 're the boss . How about if I ask you what 's goin ' on . This is your scene , baby . Lester works for you , man , you want him to love you too ? " " That 's not what I want . . . " " Oh you got me cold , Whitey . I 'm settin ' here thinkin ' evil thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table and rested his head on it . " Yeah , " he sang softly : " I woke up in the mornin '  --  You were on my mind . . . " " You mean that Lester works for the politicians ? " " I mean that Lester works for the White Devil . " He shook his head and laughed . " Yes sir . Lester works for the White Devil . " Rainey set his glass down . " Man , " Berry said , " do n't look so put down . Do n't give me that shocked virgin look , baby , ' cause you 'll break my heart . Yeah . He works for politicians . He works for cops . For the mob . For all of it . " " Yes , " Rainey said . " That 's what I meant . " " The White Devil is the God of this place , baby . He is the local deity . All those people in the hole in the wall hoo-ha Christ Almighty Church of this and that worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they worship the White Devil . There 's all sorts of prayer , you dig it ? " " Yes , " Rainey said . " I see . " " You see . " Berry settled in his chair . " That 's fine . It ai n't sop244hard for a young perceptive sensitive miracleman to comprehend , is it ? It 's not news , is it , baby ? " " But the survey , " Rainey said . " I do n't understand the sur-vey . " " Let me ask you something . You ever hear of the Big Store ? " " The Big Store ? What store ? " Berry stood up , hiccoughed and walked over to the counter . He threw six dollars on a stack of dirty towels and started for the door . " Next time you 're up to city hall , ask them what the Big Store is . They 'll enlighten you . " Rainey sat for a moment at the table staring into Berry 's empty bottle . The porter was in the kitchen wringing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran out the door and down the sidewalk which was crowding with people coming back from work . In a minute he had drawn abreast of Berry ; people stopped on the street to stare at them . " What 's the Big Store ? " Berry looked at him in suprise and walked on . " The Big Store , " Berry said , in an expansively scholarly tone , " is where you were just sitting drinking my whisky . And the Big Store is also out here on this pleasant street . " They stopped at the corner . People in the houses across the way went to their windows to lean out and watch . " The Big Store , " Berry continued , " is an invention of the White Devil  --  specifically of a man named Yellow Kid Weil and it 's a swindle , you dig ? In the procedure known as the Big Store the swindler takes the mark to some place that 's gon na get him what he wants . He fakes a horse parlor or a brokerage office . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone and messenger boys runnin ' in and out , it 's a whole busy world . But it 's all a put on . " The cats on the phone , the impressive business types at their desks , the messengers  --  they 're all actors . Nothing is happeningexcept that somebody is being put on.  | " The Big Store man makes his own reality , understand . He creates a whole world that somebody , for some reason , wants to believe in . Real people , real action , but it 's not exactly happening , you dig ? " Rainey stood in silence , trying to keep his neck from twisting to the side . The drink and the hot sun had his head throbbing . " Lester operates the Big Store for the White Devil , " Berry said quietly , smiling , with just a glance over his shoulder . No one was near enough to hear them . " He makes things happen back here the way someone wants them to happen . He shows the man whatever the man wants to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . Sometimeswhen he can , he shows people things they wish they had n't seen . Maybe that happened to you , huh ? And your survey baby is a Big Store trip . Man there ai n't no survey . Ai n't nothin ' bein ' surveyed . There 's a white politician named Minnow who wants to please the white folks by getting a lot of niggers thrown off welfare . The survey is for him to do it . The results were in beforethe damn thing started . They must have sent you down to Lester for him to baby-sit you . " " I 'm going to strike this down , " Morgan Rainey said . " I 'm going to break this . " " Good cat , " Berry said , patting Rainey on the shoulder . " You go get ' em . " " It 's not possible , " Rainey said . " There , there , baby . Do n't feel so bad . I 'll tell you a little story make you feel better . See , Lester knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another because you could n't live with yourselves and all like that . He enjoys that phenomenon very much , you dig it ? Well , one time they sent him down a fool like you and he walked that cat over a whole floor of his wiggy little hotel interviewing different people . All sorts and kinds and shapes of humanity . Every one of them  --  man , woman and child  --  was the same cat . It was the greatest Big Store trip ever pulled and old Lester did it sheerly for the sport . " Berry removed his shades and wiped his eyes.  | " Fella 's name was Archie that was all the people . Archie had a lot of talent but the day was Lester 's . It was too much . That white man left with a notebook full of details and a funny feelin ' somewhere way down in his head . I do n't think it ever really got to him . " He was weeping with mirth , waving his shades in Rainey 's face . Rainey began to laugh with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twisting his rainhat , nearly doublingup . " That 's it , that 's it , " Berry said , gripping Rainey 's shoulder . " Too much . " " Too much , " Rainey said . Children watching them from the far side of the street , grinned broadly . Passersby paused and stared at them as they weaved together on the corner , convulsed with laughter . At Audubon Park , Rheinhardt and Geraldine would walk along the bayou and then under the live oaks around the golf course . In late spring afternoons , the park was like a vaporous enclosure , dead hot and richly scented with heavy exhalations of soil and leaf . They would walk very slowly , avoiding an occasionalball that crashed into the branches overhead , and watch the golfers . Sometimes they walked along the row of houses at the south edge of the park ; at the end of the row was a compound where the Tulane agricultural school kept its animals . In the compoundlived a spotted colt who would gallop to the fence whenever they came up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thicket on the park side of the path . In a week when Rheinhardt had a run of late hour sessions , he and Geraldine went to Audubon Park three times , and each time Geraldine fed the colt . The next day they went the colt was not there.  |p247Geraldine  said : " I should n't have fed him . They put spray on those leaves . He 's probably poisoned . " Rheinhardt shrugged , feeling a sudden uneasiness . There was something chilling about the empty pasture . He looked at Geraldine quickly and saw her dull eyed and haggard . A sort of anger stirred in him . It was nearly dark ; the park had grown very quiet , the lamps had been lighted along the paths , and there was no one in sight . Rheinhardt bit his lip and felt a spasm of fear . Damn it , he thought , this is too close to the edge . There were too many crises of nerves in a day . " They have him over somewhere else , " he said quickly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fence as though terror stricken . " C'm on , man , " Rheinhardt said . " For Christ 's sake . " " Something awful is happening , " Geraldine said . It was no matter of horses . " Something fucking awful is happening all the time . " " C'm on , man , " Rheinhardt said . " How would you know ? " As they walked back , Rheinhardt put his arm around her . They walked out of step , lumbering , to St. Charles Avenue ; Geraldine leaned close to him as they walked . " You know how it is , Rheinhardt . " Rheinhardt held her tightly . He was afraid that she would go out of control in some way ; if she did , he thought , then he would lose hold himself . It had not seemed to him that in the gentle quiet of that particular day they were so closely pursued . They stopped by the bandstand where the streetcar stopped , holding each other , fearing each other 's desperation , clinging to the buttress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time coming . Two students smoking cigars walked by and looked at them and said : " Ai n't love grand . " Geraldine was altogether still in his arms . There was nothingp248diffuse about her panic , he thought ; frightened she became rather stolid , her nerves ceased to function . Love is grand , Rheinhardt thought bitterly . Nature is sublime . He held her , she clung to him , he drew the customary strength from the warm and sensuous dependency of her body against his and he was all right . Yes . Love was grand . I 've been here before , Rheinhardt thought . He kissed her in despair . ' When they were on the streetcar , Rheinhardt said that what they needed was a drink . He recalled that there was no liquor in the house . " I do n't know , " Geraldine said . " I want a drink , " Rheinhardt told her . " If I want a drink , you want a drink . " " Yeah , " Geraldine said . " I guess that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streetcar window at the dark trees . It would have to be , he thought . Rainey walked home from Artesian Street . As he climbed the patio stairs he heard the " Kyrie " of the Berlioz Requiem from Bogdanovich 's apartment . He stopped and rapped on the screen door ; from inside came the same quick shuffle of concealment that usually answered his knock in Back of Town . In a moment Bogdanovich came to the door and looked at him through the screen . " Kyrie Eleison , " Bogdanovich said . " Is Rheinhardt here , " Rainey asked . " I 'd like to ask him something . " Bogdanovich opened the door and bowed him inside . Rheinhardtwas sitting on an orange sofa ; above him on the wall was a checkered nude by Gustav Klimt . The dark girl who lived with Bogdanovich sat cross-legged on a cedar chest . Their eyes were red and filmy ; the apartment smelled of marijuana . Rheinhardt got up and turned off the record player . " What would you like to ask me , Kyrie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment and sat down in a canvas chair . He folded his hands in his lap and fell at once into his interviewing manner . " Now . . . " he began . " Who 's out there ? " called a voice from the bathroom . Someonewas splashing about the tub . " Are they cool ? " " It 's the man upstairs , Marvin , " Rheinhardt said . " Nobody would exactly call him cool , but I do n't think he 'll have us arrested . You wo n't have us arrested will you , Mr. Rainey ? " " I have nothing against marijuana , " Rainey said . " Down in Venezuela they . . . smoked it . " Bogdanovich , Rheinhardt and the dark girl watched him with a curious satisfaction . " He says he wo n't have us arrested , " Rheinhardt called to Marvin , " because they smoke pot in Venezuela . " " I 'll buy that , " Marvin said . " Rheinhardt , " Rainey said , " there 's a man named Calvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I heard him speak on your station once . Do you know him ? " Bogdanovich , who had been lighting a joint , passed it along toRheinhardt and began to laugh silently , holding his belly . " Calvin Minnow , " he exclaimed . " Calvin Minnow ! " " Sure , " Rheinhardt said , exhaling . " Cal . Cal Minnow . He'sa good cat . I remember him . He has a happy face . " " Do you know what he 's doing to the people on welfare ? " " I do n't know anything , " Rheinhardt said . " All I know is he has a happy face and he chews a lot of Sen-Sen . " " He has a plan to throw half the people on state relief off the rolls . He 's going to do it to get his name talked about . " " Yeah , " Rheinhardt said . " They all got plans . Everybody has a plan . It 's pretty weird . " " What other plans do those people have Rheinhardt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , " the dark girl said , " I thought we were going to talk about Venezuela . " " Mr. Rainey , " Rheinhardt said , " I am not the one who knowsp250the plans . I can only assure that for myself I have no plans of any sort whatsoever at all . " " I 've never been to Venezuela , " Bogdanovich said , " But I have a very clear picture of it in my mind . " " I mean I 'm not trying to compromise you , " Rainey said . " It 's just that . . . you 're the only person I know who has any contact with that business . You 're the only person I can ask . " " I would hate Rheinhardt to be the only person I could ask , " the dark girl said . " I do n't know quite why . " Rainey sat frowning and watched them pass the resinous joint between them . Back in the bathroom , Marvin began to sing " Sailing To Venezuela . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your voice over the radio  --  I hear it all the time back there where I work . What do you get from them ? Why do you work there of all places ? You could do other things . " " That 's right , " the dark girl said . " You have to admit that , Rheinhardt . How come you work for those degenerate creeps ? " " My employers are not degenerate creeps , " Rheinhardt said . " They are Some Of The Finest People In Our Community . It 's true that they 're terrible when aroused . . . . " " Man , " the girl said , " they 're terrible all the time . They 're sub-human cruds . " " You talk like an extremist , " Rheinhardt said . " You 're not seeing the Big Picture . Rainey is n't the only one who has been seized with melancholy introspection . Speaking as a broadcaster , it 's my opinion that there is a deep confusion in the popular heart and mind . The pop heart and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The explanation numberis very big . " He drew his toke and passed the joint with a shrug . " Trust me . Trust your Rheinhardt . " " Do n't be a degenerate creep , " the girl told him . " My conscience is clear , " Rheinhardt said . " It 's bone dry . " Rainey stared at him , blinking.  |p251Marvin  came into the room wrapped in a souvenir towel from Miami Beach . " I think it 's great , " he told them . " Great ! Like it 's an exercise in sheer existential amorality . It 's sadistic in the true sense of Sade . " " And it 's masochistic in the true sense of Masoch , " Bogdanovichsaid . " All that shit , man . Rheinhardt is great ! Rheinhardt is heroic . " Marvin adjusted his towel to a Ciceronian drape . " You 're heroic , Rheinhardt . You have a heroic dimension . " " I speak to the troubled heart , " Rheinhardt said . He stretched his fingers before him to play a tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rheinhardt suffers , " Marvin said . Bogdanovich bowed . " Rheinhardt saves . " " No , " Rheinhardt told them modestly , " Really . " " What happened to you , Rheinhardt ? " Rainey asked .

I do n't believe you 're such a prick that you 're . . . that you have no humanity . I do n't know why . " He looked about him as though for escape . " If I thought that I would n't have asked you to help me . As far as I can see you 're the only one who can tell me what I need to know . " " And what is that ? " Rheinhardt asked . " Damn it , " Rainey said . " I mean about what 's happening . " Marvin was lying on a corner of the sofa , enfolded in his bright towel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Christ , " the dark girl said , " I do n't want to know what 's happening . Who cares what 's happening ? " " Rainey is an athlete of perception , " Rheinhardt said . " And he has faith in me . I 'm going to tell him what 's happening . " " I 'll tell him , " Marvin said . " I went for a walk last night  --  you know me , I do n't go anywhere . But last night I was in thep252street . I looked in all the penny arcades . I looked in all garages , Walgreen 's  --  all those places . I thought what 's happening . It 's all spine . It 's like fish . And then I thought well how do the fish live in the sea , man , as men do on land . That 's what 's happen-ing . " " That 's awful , " the girl said . " Awful , " Marvin sneered . " What the hell do you mean aw-ful . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Marvin said . " Great ! " " Two years ago , " the girl told them , " I got out of the House of D.

" Her eyes grew wide ; she hunched her shoulders and hugged herself . " My God , " she sighed , shivering , " Polonia Hall ! " " The weather is sort of weird , " Bogdanovich said . " We 're going batshit , " the dark girl screamed . " That 's what 's happening . " " Calm , " Rheinhardt ordered . " All important changes have already taken place . Everything is as it should be . The situation is developing normally . " " Ha , " Marvin said . " That 's the kind of empty assurance you always get from the radio . " " What in fact is happening , " Rheinhardt said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They sat in silence for a moment . Rainey 's head jerked suddenly to one side . Bogdanovich pointed his finger at Rheinhardt in alarm . " That 's it , " he said . " That 's it , man ! " " A bracing turn , " Marvin said . " A wiggy exhilarating turn . " " One by one the warm weather creatures will topple dead wit ! frosted eyelids , " Rheinhardt told them . " The creatures of the cold will proliferate . The air will become thin and difficult to breathe . "  | " Great , " Marvin said . The dark girl placed her hands across her chest . " I 'm a warmweathercreature , " she said sadly . " I 'll die . " " Very shortly it will start to snow . " Bogdanovich looked dreamily at the ceiling . " The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will be screwed . It 'll be Cold City .

I 'm the original . " " What a fool you are , " Rainey said with a desolate smile . He showed a half inch of pink gum over his slightly protruding teeth . " Do you spend all your time being cool ? " He stood up and walked over to where Rheinhardt sat . The others watched him , dull-eyed . " Your cool is cheap . " Rheinhardt looked up at him brightly . " Are you really the original Jack Frost , Mr. Rheinhardt , " Raineyasked . " I 'm a fool , " Rheinhardt told him . " And I 'm really the originalJack Frost . Do you require an intimate personal relationship with me ? Are you shopping for an archenemy ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike at the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored , " he explained . Everyone nodded . Rainey 's chin twisted toward his shoulder . He went back to his chair and stood behind it , his large fingers gripping the vinyl . " Well , " Rheinhardt said . " Do n't stop now . You 're the voice of Christian witness in this slough of despond . " " By God , " Rainey said , " you are an evil fool . "  | " By God , " Rheinhardt said in mockery of Rainey 's voice , " I am the evil fool of the Air . " " The evil fool of the Air ! " Bogdanovich said . " Holy Shit ! The evil fool of the Air .

If I were the evil fool of the air you bastards could n't even get in to see me . " " It 's cheap , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of mockery  --  It 's cheap ! " " Cheap ? " Rheinhardt asked , biting his lip . " Last night I woke up and nuts were growing out of patches on my body . The night before that I woke up in a room full of turtles . And let me tell you it was full of turtles . " The dark girl closed her eyes and sighed . " I 'm hip it was , " Marvin said . " There are other people hurting , " Rainey said . He was pale . " Rheinhardt ! That 's all I 'm talking about . How do you come by the right to all this special pleading ? Are you the inventor of pain ? " " I do it better than you , " Rheinhardt said . " You 're a whiner . You have a whiner 's face . Let me tell you something , whiner . I 'm not a fool as any fool can see . And I 'm not even evil . " He made a gesture of appeal to the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is Rheinhardt evil ? " Geraldine came quietly into the room , closing the screen door behind her . She sat down on the floor in the corner opposite Rainey . " No , " the dark girl said . Bogdanovich shook his head . " Not evil . " " Great ! " Marvin said . " Rheinhardt is great ! " " You see that , you cornpone Savonarola ? I 'm just a drunk . " " That 's too bad , " Rainey said , " but there are plenty of drunks . I mean , it 's unfortunate that you 're a drunk and not something else , but the value of everyone else 's life has n't changed because you became one . " " What do you know about the value of any life ? " Rheinhardtp255asked him . " I admit to special pleading . I 'm a drunk and I crave quarter . " He regarded Rainey , and smiled pleasantly . " But you 're just another nasty piece of pathology . You 're a twitch , Rainey . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowel . " He nodded soberly after the manner of clinicaldiagnosis . " Now drunks are dirty , friend . But they do n't go around leaving a thick odorous film of piety on everything near them . " Rheinhardt addressed the gathering : " I put it to you that this Rainey is God 's Skunk . Arouse his transcendental conscience and he stinks . " Rainey stood up and looked at them . " I 'm not talking about myself , " he said trembling . " I was sick . Once I was well . I ca n't do many things . I have trouble with my eyes . I was n't talking about myself . " They watched him through the glaze of the drug and passed a joint between them . Geraldine looked at the floor . " But there is such a thing as a gift of life . Humanness is given . Clay was raised to consciousness . Blood was made warm . " The dark girl ran her hand over the inside of her leg , feeling it warm . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the joint and dropped it into an ornamental wooden box . " All that gift of life and humanness is a trip . Blood , man  --  blood was made warm to keep a scene circulating . " He laughed apologetically . " I mean that 's the only reason blood is warm . " " Maybe blood is warm to make it all a nice warm bowl of soup for Brother Rainey , " Rheinhardt said . " Maybe his blood is just warm to bleed with . " " We know all that about warm blood and gifts and humanness , " Marvin said . " You do n't have to tell us that . But it do n't apply now , you dig ? " " It do n't apply ? " Rainey asked . " No , " Marvin said . " They had that trip . Nobody could swing with it . It 's over now . " " I never heard that , " Rainey said.  | " Marvin digs the New Humanism , " Bogdanovich explained . " Yeah , " the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you on the New Humanism . You 'll feel like a million dol-lars . " " The New Humanism . . . " Rainey said . " What you really ought to do , Rainey " Bogdanovich said , " is quit your job at the morgue and go to California . Go roll around in that stuff out there . It 's sweet stuff , man . " " I was in California once , " Rainey said dully . " It was very hot and gray . It burned my eyes . At night I 'd walk to where I saw lights and it would be just store windows and empty sidewalk . Car headlights going by . Nothing human . " " That 's an illusion , " Bogdanovich said . " Cars in California come on very hard but they have soft organic centers . " " God , " the girl said , " what an ugly concept . " " Ugly  --  Beautiful . " Marvin said , preparing another joint . " Stupid distinctions . " " Tell us about Venezuela , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear about . " Rainey leaned on his chair as though he were unable to rise , Rheinhardt looked at him , observing his pallor , his slack jaw , his lifeless eyes , and shuddered . When he glanced for the first time at Geraldine , he saw that she was looking at Rainey too . " Listen , Rainey , " Rheinhardt said . " I know your anguish and I have no right to deny it . Let me offer you an alternative . Despairand die  --  how about that ? " " Yes , " Rainey said . His smile showed the line of gums . " Do n't say yes casually . Embrace it . Despair and die  --  how about it ? " " Yes , " Rainey said , standing up . " No , no , " Rheinhardt said . " Despair and die right now while you 're among friends . " Geraldine looked at him angrily . " Rheinhardt , do n't do that . " " It 's valid , " Marvin said . " It 's a valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do their own flipping , " **30;8104;TOOLONG clappy beds and shitty castles and made marriage , and love , the human condition . But is the Bible first concerned with manwomanlove ? No . Stop fighting . Did Rameses ever order a statue of his love ? No . Me , me , me . Ever go into a cave and see a prehistoric drawing of a man and woman , boy and girl in the postures of love ? No . Animals , yet , eating stuff . Did the White Lady of Brandberg on that cave wall in Southwest Africa allow herself to be discovered in a compromising position ? No . She was out hunting , surrounded by hunters and Springbok , looking for that eating stuff again . So what ? Lillian , I love you . They finished the drink and walked once more . Max was still thinking of love when she spoke . The heart , they used it for everything : courage , guts , love . ( " Have you ever slept with Char-lotte ? " ) Floomp , the heart again . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned on . She knows something , Max thought . No , she 's guessed something , and he thought once more of how Charlotte had been at dinner . ( " No , why do you ask that ? " ) " Oh , I just wondered . I 'm not jealous . " He heard her clearly now , all thoughts of love whisked away in favor of defending himself . Stoutly . " That 's a hell of a thing to be thinking about . " " I 'm sorry then . " " What if I 'd said yes ? " " I did n't expect you would , Max . " They both sighed with relief when they entered his apartment . It had gotten chilly and too much walking when you are in love can be exhausting . Lillian opened the nightcase she had brought before they had gone to Harry 's and pulled out a gown . She was going , she had told her parents , to visit a friend in New Rochelle for the weekend . She looked at the bag and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . All they want is a lie plausible enough to be-lieve . " " Stop it , " Max said . She was , of course , referring to her earlier question about Charlotte . He put his head in her lap . She said , " Itp101was before I met you . I do n't care if you did . She is nice and not nice . Harry  --  " Max sat up . " What about Harry ? " Lillian put the gown down and got up to make drinks . " Does he really make a living writing ? " " Yes . " " But he 's written more books than you . " " Yes , he 's also a little older . Lillian , what is it ? " " Nothing , here . " She gave him his drink . " Do n't do that . " " What ? " " Start something and not finish it . " " Sorry . " " Go on . " " With what ? Really , there 's nothing . " " Sure ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay . One more , then to bed . " Lillian watched him from the chair . She was so quiet that Max turned . " Okay , now what ? " She laughed and went to him , holding him tightly . " Ah , well . Honey ? " " Tell me what . " " I think I love you very much . " She did n't look at him . It was sometime during the far side of the night . Both had heard and seen separately something in black ( was it ? ) , prancing at the top of a hill , ready to gallop down . Max turned first . Lillian was there in her sleep , refusing to wake completely , enveloped in that millennia-old dream of women to be taken , to be had ; and she was warm when Max slipped the gown from her and the nipples of her breasts grew taut and hard ; her skin rippled and her light bones slipped under it . Max came at her and his dream was old too , the dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal-like , of the consequences ) , and to match the mock submission he created a mock rage and they stroked and kissed on the knife edge of capturep102and theft . And they knew each of them , the reality and fantasy of what they were doing and their movements were gentle , as if with great sorrow . Even the bed gave back no sound . After , they held each other ; their orgasms had been long and sweet and thorough , as if to signify that that narrow place between what was real and what was not was the best place after all . Max woke as the first gray sifted through the room . " Lillian , " he said , pushing her gently . " Lillian . Let 's get married , okay ? Okay , Lillian ? " She pushed herself up on her elbows . " Could we live on your writing ? " Max recoiled . He had some money in the bank from the folks ' house . He had n't made a dime on his first novel , but had got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $750 . He had socked away his mustering-out pay and was a member in good standing of the 52-20 club , and had disability coming . But . " I do n't know . Some of it would be a little rough , but not all of it . " Lillian hated this ; she did n't look at him . She remembered the conversation she had had with her parents . " He 's a writer , " she had told them . " Yes , " her father had said , " but where does he work ? " " Could n't you write nights and work ? " Her voice was a little plaintive and she hated it . The stories of writers were romantic and all , but you could n't eat romance , that kind , sitting around in garretsand drinking Chianti . Besides , who ever heard of a Negro writer making money ? The Ames home was n't so great . The dishes were chipped , the chairs did n't match , the kid was a mess . What happened when people stopped being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? They did n't even teach English very well where Lillian had gone to school , just so some nut would n't get the idea that he wanted to be a writer . Now she glanced at Max . " I 've gone and spoiled it , have n't I ? " She took his hand . " No , " he said . " I 'm so damned full now . I 'd hate to lose everythingworking . I feel free for the first time in my life . What would there be besides the Democrat ? There are n't that many jobs downtown ; things have n't changed that much , Lillian . "  | " You could  --  " she knew she should n't be doing this  --  " teach , or do casework . . . " " And if I do n't ? " " Then we 'll have to work something out . " Max slumped down into the bed . There were always choices . What choice was there to make ? He wanted her . Already it hurt to think of not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there a job in New York City for him ? Madison Avenue ? Park Row ? Teaching ? Social work , who wanted to do that ? That got you right next to them again , the ones who hurt so damned much that they spilled over on you , like thick sap from a tree in spring . Get a job ? Man , was n't that like the American dream ? Boy meets girl , gets good job and everything 's all reet . " Wow , honey , " he said aloud . Lillian lay on her side of the bed staring at the wall . The black thing she had seen on the hill just before they made love , moved a little , downhill . Now Lillian knew what Charlotte and Harry had seen : a middle-class Negro girl whose father was a bank janitor and whose mother worked for rich theater people on Central Park West . All right . So what ? Did that mean that she could ignore security , the crushing desire to have it ? Along with love , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course he was black , but Negro men , they had a way of starting out with a bang , with the long , long dream , but ending with less than a whisper , so beaten were they simply because they had dared to dream in the first place . Max , her Max , was a man with dreams , but he had to see the hard reality of the present . You could n't eat dreams ; they would n't even put cheap , gaudy furniture from the 125th Street stores into your home . If you dreamed too much you got hurt . In her classes she could look out on the children and knew that killers were already stalking their dreams . How had Max managed to elude the killers ? Suppose Max said no . He would n't say no ; he could n't say no , and she knew it as well as he did . Charlotte had seen all this , the whore , white whore . Max twisted in the sheets . In the final analysis there is always something someone wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way others did when they saw him coming ; she had asked for nothing , until now . Now what she was asking for might be the most important thing of all and he had no choice but to give it to her . WINTER . Harry Ames stared out the front window at the bleak street . How did he really feel about winter ? He tried to bring his thoughts back to work , but he was waiting with foolish anticipation for Max to stop by . He usually did when he was finished with his rounds . Harry looked down at his shoes and they gave him an idea . He 'd take all his shoes out of the closet and polish them . Charlotte'stoo . All the time he 'd be thinking about the unfinished paragraphstill in the typewriter . Yes , he would polish shoes . Charlotte would be proud of him . When he had finished the shoes he returned to the typewriter , snappily pulled up his chair , reread the paragraph which paused at a comma . Listlessly his eyes drifted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How come he had n't seen that before ? He took out the five-and-dime sharpener and then , one by one , with the utmost care , he sharpened the pencils . Where the hell was Max ? The New York Times Book Review lay under some paper , and Harry picked that up and scanned it again , frowning at the picture of a young Negro novelist whom he had never heard of . It gave him a jolt that the review was what they call " a rave . " He looked at the picture of the plump novelist . Fat face , eyes like slits . Hmmm . Have to get the book , see what this young boy is putting down . Could be a challenger to the Ames prestige . Them white folks : divide and conquer or , divide and pay less money for talent becauseeveryone 's scufflin ' to get there and takin ' pennies for the project.  |p105Too  bad , he continued thinking , that the artists were so terribly distrusted by the Party . The Party people never understood what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers and musicians , only the workers , and as soon as the workers got theirs , to hell with everything . Labor ( workers ) was going to be one of the Fattest Cats , Harry guessed , when the smoke of the war finally blew over . It had had the foot way inside the door even when the war broke out . The worst kind of tyrant was the one who once had been a victim . People Harry had known in the Party were complaining these days about the " Iron Curtain . " That Churchill sure had a way of making names stick . Harry 's friends complained , but rationalized that the Soviets would soon return to their own borders . They had to stay in those places to help those countries back on their feet , just the way the U. S. was doing . But Harry insisted that the Soviets were there to stay , in Hungary , Poland , Latvia , Estonia and all the other places . He did n't have to rationalize ; he was n't in the Party anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a resurgence of power in America . Nowadays it looked like the Communistswere coming back big , riding the coattails of the liberal organizations that were being born with the speed of rabbits fornicatingagainst a stop watch . But there were already blazoning signs that communism was going to catch hell just as after War I when the heady atmosphere of liberalism was becoming just a bit too much to stomach . Americans were afraid to suck every drop of meaning from the words that had given their country birth in the first place . New liberalism ? Look at Max . Max Reddick was trudging across the street head down . Max Reddick , a good , competent writer , Harry thought . Ideas to he worked out , a style to be cleaned up and set free . Best reporter the Democrat ever had . New liberalism ? Look at him . Poor black bastard . All those white boys he knew covering those big stories , that is , the ones who came back in one piece and got their jobs back , were they not liberals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thep106way they helped set one another ? Uh-uh . No . And Max is still hurtingfor that girl and a good job . Marriage . By now he may know what kind of marriage it would be . Nothing wrong with the girl , except that she ca n't do Max no good . All she sees is a house with a white picket fence , a refrigerator and a washing machine . Such a fine-looking broad , too . Jesus ! That chick could be so great for Max . Harry saw Max move out of sight , approaching the house . In a moment he would be ringing the doorbell . Harry was glad Charlottehad a little money . Not a hell of a lot , just enough so they could get by comfortably . And it was getting so that he was commandinglarger and larger advances . There had been some talk too about adapting one of his books for the stage . Yeah , it was going all right , so far . But Charlotte . Getting to be a drag , demanding more and more time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though she wanted to rip him away from the typewriter for good . That was her rival , the machine . But what a rival ! It would n't scream or fight back . Charlotte hated it all the more . On the spur of the moment , Harry decided to go down and meet Max and pick up the mail . Hastily , he rolled the paper in the typewriter so that only the very top of the page showed . Then he took some blank paper and placed it underneath his unfinished manuscript . With a little skip and a floundering left jab at an unseen enemy , Harry Ames moved to the stairway as the buzzer sounded . Max Reddick was evil . He wanted to punch out every white face he saw . Evil was beyond anger ; it was a constant state , the state of destruction , someone else 's . Impatiently he rattled the doorknob . C'm on , Harry , you sonofabitch ; let me in from these white folks ' streets . He glanced behind him . February . Cold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snow and made it melt faster . Today had been payday for Max . For weeks he had been kept dangling , waiting for the final word to come in on several jobp107applications with newspapers and magazines . He would n't have been kept dangling at all had it not been for Kermit Shea . They had been at Western Reserve at the same time , had met at political meetings often enough to nod to each other , nothing more . Then they had met again while covering the Boatwright case and Max learned that Shea worked for the Telegram . They had had coffee and drinks together a few times , again , until Max walked into the Telegram office to apply for a job and found Shea in charge of Cityside news . Max knew as he filled out his application that Shea was embarrassed . To hell with him . Shea told him the Telegramwas full up , but expecting departures momentarily , then steered Max to a number of other editors . The interviews were always the same : colorful newsmen 's jabber , changing constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public . These were followed by the application-form ritual and , finally ( sometimes days later , sometimes at once ) , the leaning back in the chair , man to man ( " You and I are above all this , but the publisher ai n't and he 's the man who lays out the shekels , right ? The implication being that the Jews were driving the WASPs out of newspaper publishing but call me next month , right , Max ? " ) And then the handshakes that said that the time was n't right , but when it is , Max , boy will we call you ! There was n't a newspaper downtown that Max had missed , armed with Shea 's recommendation . ( Shea had stopped talking about jobs at the Telegram . Now he only talked about when he was in Italy with the Stars and Stripes and how he had come close to doing a piece on the Buffaloes . But today had been payday . It had been Shea , that bitterly cold morning , who had turned his chair over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could spring for drinks . Drinks , that basic American ritual for saying hello , goodbye , it 's good to be home unwinding , you 're fired , you do n't have it . Like that . And yet Max had come to like Shea , a tall gangling man with prematurely graying hair and a face still filled with childish fat . Over drinks Max could tell that Shea was discov/ering for the first time in his life what kind of world he lived in , what kind of world he had helped to build simply by not building at all . For Max it was the end of the rope as far as downtown was concerned . If he still wanted Lillian , it would have to be the Harlem Democrat , if it would have him . The routine would be galling and regressive . There was no more time to crap around . But what if the crap really had flooped all over the place ? Say all the papers had called the Democrat for references . Wow ! If the people at the Democrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtown they 'd give him the shaft . Was it human nature or the human nature of blacks bombarded with minuscule hatreds hourly that would make them happy to turn him away just as Mister Charlie downtown had ? It would , in fact , give them more pleasure . No , there was no more time . Lillian Patch was pregnant . Lillian wanted an abortion because , she said , she did not want to push Max into anything he was n't ready for . Max , on the other hand , was willing to marry and settle for the Democrat and write nights . Or was he ? Was n't he going to ask Harry this morning for the name of a doctor who could do the abortion  --  if they both finally agreed on it ? C'm on , Harry , open the goddamn door ! Now , he was even getting pissed off at Kermit Shea . Hell , he was white , why not ? Aw , crap . Then Harry was at the door , letters held in his hand . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , cursing , he noticed an exultant smile on Harry 's face . " How 'd it go ? " Harry asked . " You going to be city editor for the Times ? " " To hell with you , Harry . " " Oh-oh , " Harry mocked . " Them white folks been mistreating Max again . Mean to tell me that between Zutkin and Shea , you could n't get set up ? You better see Granville Bryant over in Fag City . He 'll get you set up or one of his boys will . " Still walking heavily up the carpeted steps . Harry went on . " I got a tremendousp109morning 's work done . It flowed like piss after twenty bottles of beer . Hit it right on the button . " But inside the apartment , Harry took a look at Max 's face and stopped the fooling . But he gave it one more try . " Uncle Harry told you how it was , Max . Sit down , I 'll give you a drink . Read this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to be faced week after week with the lies , the evasions , even the crudeness , which had been welcome sometimes . He did n't remember when he had felt the first stirrings of undirected anger ; now it seemed to have been with him all along and was just finding an avenue of escape . He sat down and read the letter Harry had given him . It said : Dear Mr. Ames : I am writing to inform you that the American Lyceum of Letters has chosen you as the recipient of a Fellowship to the American Lykeion in Athens for the year June 1947  --  June 1948 , subject to the approval of the American Lykeion in Athens .

The $500 balance of the $2,600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is kept by the Lykeion for the various services they render you . Presentation of this award will be made at our annual ceremonial , to be held on Thursday afternoon , May 24 , at three o'clock . We hope so much that you will attend the ceremonial and the luncheon that precedesit at 12:30 P.M.It would be appreciated if for the time being you would treat this information as confidential since it will not be released to the press until late in April . May I offer you my warm personal congratulations upon the action of the Lyceum . Max was showered in his own jealousy , he writhed in it . How in the holy hell could anyone get such great news on a day when he feltp110so rotten , so up against it , so wickedly caught in the Audacious Stink of Americana ? Then , lo and behold , old God lettering the tablet with lightning , miracle of miracles , no Audacious Stink at all ! America the beautiful , God shed His Grace on thee ! It was too much . One minute they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the next minute Miss Liberty is giving you the most fantastic blow job you ever had . How can you make these bastards out ? They keep you off balance . They lift while they depress . They take you apart , then sew you back together again and sometimes you do n't even want to be the Frankenstein they have made you . Goddamn them ! Max looked up and smiled . " Did you make these drinks triple , man ? " Harry , almost ashamed of his luck and now sharply aware that he must mute his joy because of Max 's depression , said , " If you do n't have anything to do , we can really celebrate . " " Where 's Charlotte ? " " Oh , she 's gone to visit her mother . You know , the once-amonththing , early in the day to keep people from staring when she gets out of the cab with the kid . Her father 's not home then , you know . " " Yeah . Look , Harry , that 's great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll put me pretty close to Africa , wo n't it ? " Harry broke into a smile . " Goddamn it , Max , they 're beginning to know I 'm here , that we 're here . Max , this could be a whole new thing . Keep your fingers crossed . We 're coming up , Max . Ai n't no stopping us . Who 's that boy got such a great review in the Times , you know him ? " Harry retrieved the Book Review . " Marion Dawes . " " I do n't know him , " Max said , amused . " I 'll bet Granville Bryant knows him . " " One of these days , " Max said , " them people are going to kick your ass for you . Good . " " Oh , hell . Then I 'd be finished in this town , would n't I ? " They laughed . " Wait until Charlotte comes home , " Harry said , then , " How 's Lillian ? "  | " We need a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it , nodding . " How far ? " " Little over two . " " What about the wedding ? " Harry was shouting from the kitchen now . Max found it too trying to shout anymore . He waited until Harry returned . " She is not sure . " " You ? " " Yes . I mean , I guess so . There 's always the Democrat . " " And the new book ? " Max scoffed . " What new book ? " " Man , but I told you , " Harry said loudly . " When you have a book ready to come out , as you have in a couple of months , you should always have something in the oven , ' cause they 'll forget you in a flash . They wash white writers right down the drain . You know what they 'll do for us ! " " The doctor , Harry . I just want the name of a doctor . Right now , man , I just ca n't cut it . " " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some soup ? It 's on the stove . " Apparently nearly everyone in New York knew the doctor . There was a little history that went with him . It seemed that his only daughter had " got into trouble " and had an abortion by some hack and died . The good doctor thereafter set himself up for the major purpose of providing abortions for young women who had got into similar " trouble . " There was only one hitch , the talk went . The doctor required two visits , one to determine the condition of the patient medically and psychologically , for he would never do an abortion if he felt the couple were good for each other . The doctor was said to have been responsible for more successful marriages than all the marriage counselors , priests , ministers and marriage computers put together . There was a second visit only if the doctor deemed the relationship a detriment . As it turned out , of course , the doctor was nothing like that atp112all . He insisted that he did not know the reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimate general practitioner operating well within the law and that he felt insulted that they had come to him . Unless , of course , someone in New York City was playing a joke . No , he did n't now anyone who would . Had Max never heard of the Medical Ethic ? Max and Lillian drove back to New York in almost complete silence . The landscape that flashed past them was hard , frozen , as stiff as the black leafless trees . Lillian felt empty . She was almost tempted once or twice to ask Max to stop at the nearest justice of the peace , but she knew that would be no good . He had no job yet , the future was n't even on the horizon . She had counted on Charlotte'sset knowing about these things . After all , they were involved in these things more often than Negro girls . But , see ? Nothing , not one damned thing . Oh , you just ca n't trust those people . But it was n't their fault , really . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was n't . She simply had never been much good at counting , that 's all there was to it . Well , she 'd get back to New York and see about this whole business herself . If you looked hard enough for a thing , you found it . Now Max was saying something about forgettingit and getting married , that things would work out . Good God ! Lillian thought . Does n't he know that those last words are as famousas Lenox Avenue and 125th Street ? The cry of Harlem : Things Would Work Out . That was all the white folks ever left , some bedraggled hope . And she answered him with a grunt . What , what was that he was saying , that Negro women had the proud tradition of keeping their children , no matter what ? That white people had them cut out of them with no remorse , no nothing . What does this man understand ? Does n't he know that it is all those babies that help create the valley Negroes live in ? Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing when he took away everything except the ability to make love ? Max , you are distraught . You are n't thinking . Love ? Oh , Max , yes , but love with sense . She would find a way ; someone would know something for sure.  |p113Not  in Harlem . There were abortionists there , but the women doubledas hustlers , barmaids , distributors of election campaign material , numbers runners , midwives , boosters and baby-sitters . There had to be something else . The men who were either doctors or orderlies or morticians charged too much and talked too much . " It will be all right , " Lillian said when Max let her out at home . " What do you mean ? " " What I said . " " Come back here , " he said . " Come here ! " She returned to the car . " I want to know what you meant by that , Lillian . I want to know . " " I meant that I would n't let it worry me . We 'll come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's not do it . Suppose something happens . It will work out . You 're tearing me apart . You 're making me think I 'm not worth anything , that I do n't have what it takes to make it . Let 's have the kid . " " No , Max , I ca n't . " Max sighed . " Baby , please do n't do anything foolish . I 'll call you tomorrow . " It was painful to call two or three times a day now . There was nothing to say and seldom anything to report in the way of finding a doctor . So the calls were now down to once a day and their voices were low , as if barricaded against some evil word slipping out that they could never recapture and hide away . So many times he had wanted to shout out : " Careless bitch , you , Lillian ! " And she had wanted to say that he had been inconsiderate , that they never saw each other when he had n't wanted to make love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure and therefore had n't her thing and he had n't wanted to use a condom . Dully , Max watched her enter her house . There was a finality about her movements that made him uneasy . She did n't even turn around to wave goodbye . She was up to something . Fuck around now and get killed , he thought in a grim panic . C'm on , Shea , he thought ; c'm on , Zutkin , one of you goodie-goodie bastards . Can'tp114you see I 'm hurting , hurting , and my girl , my woman is hurting . My whole motherfucking life is a gaping , stinking hurt ! Give me my share ! I am a man . Do n't make me take it in this anger ! Hot tears poured from his eyes and blinded him along with his anger . He snatched the wheel and the car spun around , skidded across the street on a patch of ice and ran up on the curb . He started the car again and climbed up the hill in first gear . One week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of up . She was going to take the bus to Paterson , New Jersey . She had found a doctor . It was all arranged . She would be met outside the terminal by the nurse who would drive her to the office . Afterward , she would he driven back across the George Washington Bridge and placed in a cab . Then she would be on her own . No curettage would be necessary . She would be all right . That was the doctor 's personal guarantee . The whole business would cost four hundred dollars . Lillian felt both relief and dread . Relief that she had found someone to do it , and dread that she had to go through it alone . Just once , while waiting for the bus , she thought to call Max and ask him to be at her house when she returned , although she did n't really know what time that would be . But it would be nice to know that he was there waiting for her . She did not call . She had gone this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd both be more careful , very careful until things worked out for the future . Going over the Bridge , she saw the sullen clouds break long enough for a smear of bright , golden sun to appear , far , far ahead of her in the west . Then she went to sleep , taking that as a good omen . A relievedhalf-smile came to her small face marked by the high-riding cheekbones . As she relaxed and became as one with the gently jostlingbus , Lillian Patch , in an instant 's panic , felt that the thing she had seen in her half-sleep months ago was breaking blackly down that long , eerie hill , coming directly at her . It was eleven o'clock in the morning . Once again the city was in the grip of a long , bitter freeze . The thick ice and snow in the roadsp115and on the walks showed no sign of thawing . Inside his apartment , Max Reddick , who hated rye , poured himself a half glass of it . Everything else was gone . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Slowly , he zipped up the fly and fastenedthe belt , staring at himself all the while in the mirror , which reflected the bed behind him . From the bed they had been able to see themselves in the mirror . Now Max flapped the tie around his neck , paused to drink , then knotted the tie . He pulled the jacket on and , in a sullen daze , patted it down his body . Black suit for dress , black suit for death . Still moving slowly , he went to the bed and snatched off its covers . On his knees now , he looked closely at the blankets and sheets . One by one he plucked up her hairs , the tightly curled , dully glowing pubic hairs , the long , thinner , brighter head hairs . He stood and rubbed them between his thumb and finger . He brought them back to the mirror and laid them on the dresser next to the whiskey . He looked up at his reflection and thought , I am as dead as she . Deader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she usually was home . Her mother said that she had n't come home yet , and somehow , right away , Max had known . He called later and still Lillian had not come home . He did not call again , foreseeing that the conversationwould be stiff or angry . It was only later that he learned that : She had come home very late . Her parents heard her moving softly around her rooms . Then , there had been silence . Later they heard her again ; she seemed to be bumping into things . They had heard her in the bathroom , then out on the stairs . Later they figuredout that she had been trying to call them . They had not heard . But they did hear the noise of her falling down the stairs ; they found her at the foot of them . The trail of blood went back up the carpeted steps into the bathroom where it was a wide splotch , neatly marked with splatters , into her bedroom and in her bed . Her parents had called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been sudden and deadly . The next afternoon when Max had called , Lillian Patch was dead . It will be all right.  |p116What  do you mean ? What I said . Come back here . Come here ! I want to know what you meant by that , Lillian . I want to know . I meant that I would n't let it worry me . We 'll come up with something . Yeah , something like death . Max could n't get their last scene together out of his mind . If only he 'd gotten out of the car and walked to the door with her ! If he 'd gone in and had a cup of coffee with her ! If he had given her just one pecking little kiss , maybe . . . ! Max Reddick stared back at himself as he fingered Lillian 's hairs with one hand and finished the whiskey with the other . I 'll never forgive them . Never . And they do n't even know what they did ! They do n't even know ! He felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cyclone on the horizon , and then it came spinning up , blacker and redder , faster and faster . He could break the mirror , the glass he held in his hand ; he could smash the chairs , kick in the bed , tear the hooks off the shelves , snap records in two , throw shoes through the windows . But he knew if he had five hundred years in which to smash , it would he as nothing because it would n't hurt them at all . He would be just another Negro gone berserk , and they would read about him and think : He should have jumped right up and run after another girl , this one with yellow shoes , maybe . Goddamn them ! They could not he accused or convicted of murder or even being near the scene of the crime . What did they have to do with Lillian 's death ? Everything , and yet , they believed , would continue to believe , nothing . Max wanted to march them into ovens a million at a time ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaps ; he wanted the stink of their decomposing bodies to choke the very atmosphere . But , damn them ! They refused to understand why he wanted them dead . This was why : They gave Lillian the photograph , the image of the American Family Group , but when she looked very , very closely , she was n't in it ; she was n't even the blanked-out one ofp117every ten who would contract polio or clap or pox ; nor was she the one who was n't insured by Metropolitan Life or Allstate . She was nothing and she was not to get that little house surrounded by shrubbery and a white picket fence . But they let her teach about America the Beautiful , and she knew it was not  --  after all , she saw those kids five days a week and sometimes chased them from the backs of buses on weekends  --  they let her teach that shit and she knew it was not , but hoped it was and , my darling bitch , Lillian , you got to hoping more than knowing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your blackness , your babies ; you choked them with the reek and tremor of the ghettoes they created ; you screamed at their injustices which they denied because they must ; you stacked up , created a backlog of book-hungry kids before the doors of their quota-oriented colleges , their Wall Streets , communications centers , their theaters ; you gave them political hacks , the ones who are worse liars and thieves than they , only to create a wedge through which the uncompromisingcan later pass ; you produced good music for them to copy or steal  --  and you wrote more ; you gave them your sons to help fight their wars ( but that must stop  --  a dead Negro on a German , Japanese , French , American battlefield does very little for a live Negro pinioned to his ghetto ) . Out of all the garbage they leave for you , you produce , produce , produce , and scare the hell out of them , for if something can be made from garbage , why is it that they have only automobiles , Lillian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , baby ? Security . You are so goddamnsecure now that you do n't have to worry about where the next anything is coming from . And God knows , you do n't have to worry about me having a decent job so we can live the way you thought we ought to  --  according to their way , which is , my darling , as pitiable as it is , the only way now . Look what you 've gone and done . They have killed both of us . God , Lillian , I 'm mad , I am so mad , baby , and sorry for them , for me , for you . How did we get down here ? We should have been out of here by now . Are we going to have to explode out ?  |p118Max  moved away from the mirror and all he could do was to shake his head very , very slowly . Kermit Shea sat at his desk and stared at the gray , sluggish HudsonRiver . He felt that it was his fault , Max 's girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to feel that way , of course , nothing subtle about it . Shea wondered if he had really tried . Yes . Yes , but in trying to help Max with a job , he had felt himself threatened . Strange , the way you felt it even in the phone calls . Then there were the looks when he had mentioned that Max was Negro . Shea had n't known Ames except by reputation . " My name is Harry Ames , and I am Max Reddick 's friend , " he had said over the phone . The only friend ? Shea had wondered . " He 's had some trouble . I thought you ought to know about it . " And Ames had told him and he might just as well have added : Feel guilty , you sonofabitch ! Shea had n't known a thing about the girl , but now he understood Reddick 's curious detachment : he did n't want rejection , he needed a job desperately , but he expected rejection , which he got . " When 's the funeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and then added , " But you 'd better not come . " How many other Max Reddicks and Lillian Patches were out there , Shea wondered , with talents and desires ignored , indeed , unattributedto them ? What happened to them and how often ? And how thick were those gray ranks who had said to Shea , " How come you know this Negro guy ? " All the ramifications of that question , the inherent threat , the contempt and  --  was it concealed fear ? Ames had done his job well . Shea continued to stare at the river . Reddick , what was he doing this day of the funeral ? Cursing all white people past hell and into oblivion . Kermit Shea did n't want to be among them on that journey . He wanted to lead them . He felt that guilty . Bernard Zutkin 's office was on the East Side . He sat in it and it was quiet , and that suited him . He had no intention of going to the funeral , although he had n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly what had happened to him , to his girl , and why . In trying to help Max get a job , Zutkin had reconfirmed his own position in the literary and communications circles in New York : he was not a well-liked man . He drove hard . His view was uncluttered . He was a critic , not a reviewer . He knew the difference . When he chose to write , he was an author , not a writer . And because he was this precise , his analyses of the communications media had earned him a steady flow of dislike . Zutkin was also a Jew in a shrinking world of Gentiles who did not understand the process of their own abdication of responsibility in both communicationsand literature ( he disliked the term " publishing " ) . Gentiles had run out of family blood ; now they were being beaten out or getting out . When they finally realized what they had done to themselves , they would react just like the Germans . Anti-semitism was always in the American air , Zutkin knew , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jew needed allies . There was the Negro who himself needed allies . But sadly , many of Zutkin 's friends who were Jewish and had matched his own climb up the ladder , had taken over Gentile traits . " Look , Bernie , you know and I know that this is not the time for that ! " " Well , when is the right time , do you think ? " " Do n't be a macher , Bernie . The time will come . Why do n't you hire Reddick ? " " I 'm a critic . I have an office . I teach , I 'm a professor . How could I use a man like Reddick ? And you know all this . The man needs a job now . You 've read his books and pieces . " " So , I 'm impressed . Now what ? " " Now ? Nothing . Sorry to have been foolish enough to have asked a favor of you , sweetheart . " " Aw , Bernie  --  " " The devil take you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been like that or something like that . Stupid people . Time would run out and turn upon itself . One of these days assassins might have to be sent after people like Reddick and Ames because some jerk did n't want to give them a job theyp120could do with one hand because they were black . They would have to be silenced somehow . They were learning too much about America  --  and telling it . Zutkin always thought of how they had reached out after Trotsky . Lenin did n't get him ( did n't want to , really ) , and if Stalin had n't ordered him done in , God knows Trotskywould have been around arguing and still making mistakes . And Stalin knew it , Lev Davidovich Bronstein ; somebody always knows what you are and how you are , exactly . Max Reddick fitted no exact pattern yet . The reality of his girl 's death might be good for him , Zutkin thought . A hard consideration , but the world was hard . He had a handicap ; he was a bit petit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and reporting on them , the horror of the ghettoes Ames had known . Nor had Reddick , except for his time in the Army , really known the oozing horror of being a Negro in the South . Yes , in the end , the girl 's death could rip the last ragged curtain of illusion from Reddick . A lot of white people were going to suffer at Max 's hands because of that . That 's why Zutkin was n't going to the funeral ; he could wait for his turn . He was n't jumping in the front of that line . First , Charlotte Ames had called the girl who had given her the name of the doctor in Pennsylvania . She screamed , talked and cursed , then hung up . New York , New York , where everyone wanted to be on the in in , and clutched onto the empty in things , like a nonexistent good abortionist in Pennsylvania , even to the extentof making him real enough to have a name , address and telephone number . Now , because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation , Charlotte had an argument with her husband . She lost . She was not going to help Max with his meals or invite him to stay with them . " Max and I are friends , " Harry had explained . " I do n't think he wants to be around white people today . We 've got to give him time . " Charlotte looked at him in horror . " Do you mean to say that this afternoon , he has to stand out there alone , without friends who are white , happen to be white ? "  | " Yes . " " Is that all I am , Harry , someone white , a white thing , to him ? " And she came close , too close to telling him in unrelated screams of anger and sorrow how she had been something else to him one night , how she had tricked him and taken him to soothe her own fears and loneliness and how he had fought her for Harry ( In friendship , Charlotte ! ) and how , afterwards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeared to him in a special kind of way . None of the others gave a damn about Harry . But Charlotte did not become sad enough or angry enough to tell . " Time , " Harry said again , " he 's got to have time . " " Then I ca n't go ? " " I do n't think you should . " " All right . Harry ? " " What , dear ? " " When , when will it ever be better ? " Charlotte had not been a member of the Party . She had been amused when her friends who were members had discussed the Party line : maximum integration  --  marry a Negro . And she had observed that nothing wonderful or special had resulted . They were such fools , the Communists , sometimes , but they were the most interesting people she had ever known . At least they were doing something . She was glad Harry was no longer in the Party ; it was too restricting for him . There had been times when , waking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had drawn up short , wondering what she was doing there . Then one day she had walked into the corner of the room where he was working . There had been a slight film of sweat on his face and he had n't combed his hair . He still had on his pajama bottoms . She had paused and watched him and thought , Yes , yes , I do love this man , what he is , where he came from , how he survived . Like Desdemona , thriving , loving , finally , on Othello 's talks of his deeds . But Desdemona too had defied custom . ( Brabantio : Fathers , from hence trust not your daughters ' minds / By what you see them act . ) Or your wives . Or your husbands . Charlotte knew that she hadp122not always been fair to Harry , nor he to her . But , more times than not , those affairs , both hers and his , were unimportant , birthed in ennui . They had never brought them home ; that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going with Max , if Max had had any . In a kind of warm amazement , Charlotte could not conceive of either of them being unfaithful . They had been in love ! God , she thought , good God , and now the girl 's dead . No , she had n't liked Lillian . Negro women  --  and it was not their fault  --  took their men very lightly after the first blush of love . They wanted them to be just like white men in terms of success , which meant , of course , the gracious acceptance of responsibility , the desk job where you bossed instead of being bossed , the lawn you mowed reluctantly when the leaves you raked half-heartedly were not on it . Charlotte had spotted it in a second . One day that would change ; the men would stop deceiving themselves and the women would be proud of them . The Lillian Patches would become , with reality , extinct . " He 's all by himself , Harry , " Charlotte said . " No . I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was all wound up or all run down . He drank alone nights , sitting in a chair , thinking of nothing at all , it seemed , then suddenly becoming aware that he was thinking of it all , the whole brief life with Lillian Patch . Mornings , like a madman , he rushed from the house , fleeing before some prickling obligation to get for himself the kind of job Lillian had wished for him . The day came when , after stopping by the office of the NAACP , he was advised to register at the Urban League . When that was done , he drifted home , slipped the new bottle of whiskey from its brown bag and sat down in his chair . Now he had done all he could do , except report back to the Democrat , and what was the sense ofp123that  --  now ? This night Max sat on a pillow , for his rectum had started to throb with , he thought , all the drinking . But he was damned if he 'd stop . He sat and waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the single touch of balance , the remembered thing , an origin , a point of departure or return . It came . " You working , man ? " " No . Just sitting around , " Max said , suddenly aware that he had been saying the same thing for a month and a half now . " Did you eat ? " Why the hell did Harry think eating cured everything ? " I had a bite , " Max answered , although he had eaten nothingsince lunch when he 'd got a Nedick 's frank and coffee . " Are you drinking ? " " Sure , I 'm drinking . What did you think I was doing , jerking off ? " " Bad day , huh ? Listen , did you work at all today ? " " No . I registered with the Urban League . " " Whatever in the hell for ? " Wearily , Max said , " A job , Harry , a job . " Harry said , " Oh , shit  --  listen , uh , goddamn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to educate you to the way things are ? Wake up . You 're not their kind of Negro . That 's an enclave , man , a niche . I f they 've got a spot , they 're going to slip it to some cousin or brother or some guy like them . You sure got a nerve , dragging your raggedy ass into the Urban League . This is 1947 , Max , time for you to be alert ! Tell you what : if them niggers come up with a job for you , I 'll buy you a whole case of whiskey myself , but hell , do n't you worry about that ; my money 's safe . " Max was trembling . He shouted into the phone , " Harry do n't try to fuck up my mind like that , Harry , do n't ! What 's the matter with you ? " A shocked silence of a long moment 's duration hung like lead between them , then Harry said , " Max , I 'm not trying to fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , man , let you know where it is . I 've known those fellows for years . I know what goes on , Max . Listen , I 'm sorry , really sorry , but Max , you got to let this go . Getp124out of it . Write , Max , do n't let them get to you . There 's more than what shows and everybody 's looking at the top . Get your crumbs together and meet us in Europe . I go to see the man tomorrow , the interview for the Lykeion . After that , it 'll be getting near cut-out time . C'm on , Max . What do you say ? " Max stiffened against his trembling . " Europe . Harry you 're trying to straighten out my mind , but I do n't understand yours . Why run to Europe ? There are more white people there than here . They have n't built any ovens here yet ; I keep hearing about concentration camps , but I 've never seen one here . What is this , with all you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know they started this shit that we 're stuck in ? Do n't you know that , Harry ? " " Okay , Max . The thing is , Europe is closer to Africa . Africa is where I 'm aiming , Max . I know what 's happened , and why . You got to cool it , man . Sounds to me like you 're a little shaky . Want to come down ? " " No . " " I 'll grab a train and come up . " " No , I 'm all right . " " Can I say something to you without you blowing your top ? " " You 've said everything else . Go on . " " You 'd better knock off drinking alone . Get a broad , get that pussy , lots of it and maybe it 'll pass . You got to try to help it . Max ? Max , you listening to me ? " " I hear you , Harry . " " Do it , Max , go ahead . " " Goddamn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even get it up . The blues got me and turning me every way but loose . I ca n't do anything . I do n't want to do anything . " " You sound just like a white man , Max . " " Get up off me , Harry . I 'm going to be all right . I 'm going to be just fine . I 'm going to be whole again . One day , you 'll see . " " That 's a deal ? " " Man , that 's for real . " " Okay . And eat once in a while too , will you ? "  | " Yeah . " " You sure you 're okay ? " " Yeah . Thanks . " Harry Ames hung up , stretched and walked into the room where Charlotte was listing items they would have to take with them to Europe . " How is he ? " she asked . Harry sat on the arm of the chair . He liked Charlotte in horn-rimmed glasses ; they gave her a settled look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were shouting . " " So was he . " " Bad boys , both of you . I suppose you suggested that he get himself a girl or two ? " " Nah . Just told him to stop drinking so much and eat a little bit . " " Of course . " Harry bent forward to look at the list and Charlotte said , " I guess we 'll have to get little Max 's clothes a couple sizes too large . He can grow into them . " " Hell no . Buy things that fit . " Harry was thinking of all the toolargeclothes he had ever worn : socks pulled back under the foot half a length ; pants rolled up two or three times , the tops pinned together to fit at the waist ; the shoes packed in the toe with cotton or toilet paper . . . " Charlotte , you do n't know what it does to a kid to have his clothes not fit properly . " " Insecure ? " " Yes . " " Then you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , two complete outfits each year . How about it ? " Harry rose . " Do n't get smart . Just do n't buy them so big that he gets lost in them . " " What 's the interview to be like , dear ? " " I do n't know . Did n't even know that there was to be one until I got the note . Kierzek said it was just routine . "  | " I like him . " " Who , Kierzek ? He 's all right , for an editor . " " You 've had much worse . " " It 'll be good for us , Charlotte . " " What ? " " Europe . " Charlotte lowered her pencil and said softly , " Yes , it will . The big break . But I do wish you 'd mute some of this talk about Africa . You 're not African , Harry . " She bent back to her pad . " But I 'm black . " " Really . I always thought you were brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know what I mean . " Harry had retreated to the kitchen . " Want one of these ? " " No , just water . You 're not going to get me high tonight and take advantage of me . " She smiled to herself . " Why would a man have to get his own wife high ? " She laughed aloud . " Because it 's fun sometimes . " She paused . " Darling ? " " I 'm getting the water . " " Yes , but put a little Scotch in it , will you , like a good seducer ? " Harry Ames sat down across from the man . " Tell me about yourself , Mr. Ames . " The handshakes were over ; it was time to get down to business . " I started your last book , but have n't finished it . I 'm about halfway through . " Harry stared across at the man , Mr. Kittings , director of the Lykcion in Athens . Tell me about yourself . Something 's wrong , Harry thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've not been a member of the Communist Party for almost ten years , " Harry said . " We 're interested in your art , Mr. Ames , not your politics . " Kit-. tings nodded affably and Harry continued , uneasily . Perhaps it was a look in Kittings ' eyes , perhaps in his tone of voice as he broke in to cover more fully some point in Harry 's monologue . Whatever itp127was , Harry felt suddenly and shockingly that he was in hostile territory . He stumbled for a moment , trying to find some reason for this judgment , but he could not . He went on until he had nothing more to say . Then he asked questions about Athens which Kittings answeredwith a reserve that was not communicated to his secretary . She said , " Oh , you 'll have a fine time there . We 'll make the best possible accommodations aboard ship for you and your family . " Why , Harry wondered , did he shoot his secretary such a sharp look ? The handshakes once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Hear from you ? " Harry said in sudden alarm . " About what ? " " It is usually the practice for us to stay in touch with  --  people who  --  er  --  ah  --  come in for interviews . " Outside , on the way home , Harry thought it all very strange . Kierzek had said that the interview was routine . No one selected by the panel of judges had ever been refused admission to the Lykeion . Well , then , who was this prick , Kittings , to tell him he would hear from him ? The decision was made ! Seven of the best writers in America ( Harry considered himself the eighth , now ) had chosen him , Harry Ames , to receive the Lykeion Fellowship for the year . What in the hell had Kittings to do with it ? I 'm cracking up . Just routine , like Kierzek said . Maybe Max is right . I 'm into this thing too goddamn far . What did he say , Kittings ? Nothing really . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , his eyes ? So ? Maybe the bastard 's just got naturally shifty eyes . Harry , man , ease up , eeease on up . By the time he arrived home , most of the feeling of foreboding had gone . It was going to be all right . The thing was , you could n't distrust them all the time . The sap of the earth began to run beneath the ground that Friday ; spring teased the air . Windows that had been bolted against the winter were opened briefly . A few elderly people bundled themselvesup and sat on the park benches , their pale faces lifted to the sun . Now the scarves of the students hung about the necks and coats and jackets were left unbuttoned . Charlotte went out and wasp128a long time shopping , but Harry understood ; it was the kind of day he would have liked to go walking in , but he could n't . There was too much to do : the inventory of the things in the apartment , finding a broker to handle the sublet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that . When Charlotte came in , she handed Harry the square envelope marked , The American Lyceum of Letters . Harry took the letter without comment ; he had not said anything to Charlotte about the interview except that it had gone all right . Charlotte went to the kitchen with the groceries . Little Max paused , wondering if he was going back out or was in to stay . " Do n't open it until I come back , " Charlotte said . " Help him with his clothes . It 's pretty nice out , but too much of this uncertain weather is n't good for him . " " C'mere , Max . Let Dad help you out . Attaway . " Harry felt sad as he helped him out of his outer garments . He looked at the cafeau-faitface and smiled . " Now come up here and kiss your old Dad . Big ones , now , Pow ! How to go . Another . Pow ! Pow ! " Charlotte was back , smiling expectantly . " All right , go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Smack , smack . Bye-bye . Peanut butterand jam sandwiches coming up . " She watched him go . " Open it , open it , " she said , feigning extreme anxiety . Harry passed a hand over his forehead and carefully broke open the flap of the envelope . His eyes raced down the short paragraph . " We regret to inform you that another candidate , also recommended by the American Lyceum of Letters , was awarded the Fellowship in creative writing ... " There was more , but Harry 's eyes swept back to : " We regret to inform you that . . . " " We regret to ... " Charlotte had moved to him , was crouching , one hand on his knee , ready to sit on the floor , but seeing his face , she paused ,  |p129became  motionless , awkward , half down and half up , and read his face once more , suddenly gone lifeless , suddenly fulfilled , invertedly , and she struggled upward , taking the letter from his dead hands and screaming before she started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did it , did n't they , they did it ! " Harry rolled his eyes up at her . How painful it was to move them ; he had n't noticed that before . Charlotte 's eyes raced along the letter . They were cold , her eyes , and a blue growing darker . There was a vast silence between them . It took a couple of minutes before Harry could begin to think . Another candidate ? How could that be ? The first letter said he had been chosen , selected , preferred ; there had been congratulations . He , Harry Ames had been the best . Now he was nothing . There was someone else . What a fool he had been ! Of course , he had seen it in Kittings ' eyes as he had seen it in white eyes all his life . But why ? They had had former Communists at the Lykeion . Clifford Jacobs , the composer , was Negro and had won a Fellowship in music there . Bolton Warren had been there as a Fellow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlotte and himself ? Why ? Did he have to be a faggot ? Why , why , why ? Would they ever tell him why ? Could he find out why ? " Why ? " his wife said . Very carefully he said , " Charlotte , I do n't know why . " " The Party ? " " I do n't know . " " Us , you and I ? " " I do n't know . " " But they said you 'd been chosen ! " Harry did n't want to look at her face . " I know , dear . That 's what they said . " " Well what do they mean , another candidate ' ? " " Darling , really , I do n't know . " Charlotte folded the letter along its original creases . " You said it would n't be easy . " " I guess I did . It 's the kind of thing you 'd say in our situation.  |p130The  important thing  --  look , Charlotte  --  let 's not hate each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , " she said with her eyes wide , her mouth held open . " Darling , I do n't . " Harry nodded , but he did n't believe her . Even he , thinking for her in times of crisis , thought how nice it would be to have married a white man . And why had n't he , Harry Ames , married a Negro woman ? " I do n't want you to hate either , Harry , " Charlotte said , for she knew that he too could think how much easier it would have been if he had married a Negro woman . " No , " Harry said , reaching for the letter . " They offer some consolationmoney . Let 's take it and run . " " Whatever you say . " " It 's not much . " " It would be hard , Harry . The baby . " Harry sighed . " I have to think about it . Hard . The motherfuckers , the lousy , rotten cocksuckers , the bastards , the sonsofbitches , the faggots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinking of the child , for although hewas not shouting , he was speaking slowly , distinctly and clearlyand without anger , with rather a kind of helplessness , a resignation . "  --  the shiteaters , cornholers , hermaphrodites , pricks , assholes , cunts and cunteaters  --  " " The boy , Harry . " " Let him learn it from me . He should learn it from me . Why ca n't he learn something from me , like pain , Charlotte , pain ! " " Harry , " she said , " Harry ! " " What ! " he flung at her . " It hurts us , too . It hurts like hell , you ca n't imagine . " Harry went to her and rubbed her shoulder . Goddamn it ! They were almost out of it , almost . " Let me think about the other money . As soon as I can . " He smiled . " They kinda took old Harry by surprise . "  |p131John  Kierzek had had it , really had had it . Everyone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barbed shaft from the Lyceum , but all they said was , " How strange ! " or " Gee , what happened ? " or grimly said , " Those dirty bastards , how could they ? " But no one came up with an answer . Now , Kierzek pounded down the carpeted floor to Donald Kenyon 's office . Kenyon was the president of the company . " Is n't that a goddamn shame about poor old Harry Ames ? " Don Kenyon asked . He was blond , in his forties and liked being a publisher . Kierzek was fifty , bent , with a pot and too many jobs in too many New York publishing houses under his belt . Kierzek closed the door behind him and pulled up a chair . " Don , we have to do something . We really ca n't let that man go up there at that ceremonial or whatever the hell they call it , and take a thousand dollars when we know he should have been a LykeionFellow , we ca n't let him do it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved hair . " You 're fuckin ' A right , John , but what the hell do we do ? What can we do ? " " I 'd like to suggest a few things . Okay ? " " Sure , John , anything we can do to help Harry out of this mess , goddamn it , we 'll do it ! " Kierzek waited until Kenyon finished cursing the Lyceum . He liked Kenyon all right , but the trouble with the business was that there were too many people in it who should have been elsewhere . Wall Street , for example . And Kenyon liked him or needed him . Well , that was all right . It kept Kierzek in books , and he liked books . He could n't be glib about them . His rejections were very readable ; no fog , none of that overstocked or untimely business for him . That was really creeping into publishing these days . Snotnosededitors , still jerking off on the sly , or half or whole faggots . Jesus ! For two days Kierzek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the conference tables before the conferences began . No guts in the business anymore . Everyone broke their balls looking for talent , but when they had it right in their semeny hands , itp132scared the crap out of them . Kierzek could n't understand it . During the war he had been an overaged navigator on first the B-24 's and then the B-29 's . He had made many a flight from Tinian to Japan and back . It was strange that in this world of desks and manuscripts , of spry , sexy little girls and homosexuals , of long lunch hours  --  a world so free of the direct approach of death stalking down the sky  --  fear ran rampant . " First , " Kierzek said , " we 'll give him a three-thousand-dollar advance on his new book . His plans to go to Europe are made ; he 's been set to go for months . It 'll kill him if he does n't go . If we can help him , it 'll be great for his ego  --  " " Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapping at his hair . " It wo n't hurt us to help him , " Kierzek said . " We back up our authors . " " Of course , we do , " Kenyon said . " We 'll give him that much of an advance on one condition  --  " "  --  that he wo n't accept that fuckin ' Lyceum money , right , John ? " " Right . " " Have you see the new book ? " " No . " " No ? " " No . " Kenyon waved his hand . " Does n't matter . If it 's Harry Ames , it 'll be good , right , John ? " " It should sell . Now , Don . It 's really very important that you write to the Lyceum and on Harry 's behalf , demand an explanation . I mean , the poor bastard 's wondering if he 's diseased , nuts or a few thousand other things . " " John , do you think it 's because of his wife ? " " Who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , you know what I mean . You know how people are . Does n't make any difference to me  --  gee , she 's a nice-looking doll , is n't she ? " " Yes . No , I do n't know why . His Party connections , beingp133Negro , his marriage , I just do n't know . It could be just one of those things or all of them , but he should know what he 's being charged with or penalized for . Can you get the letter off today , Don ? " " You 're fuckin ' A. Mabel , baby , " he called to his secretary in an outside office . " C'm on , you got ta go to work , sweetie . Let 's hit it . Anything else , John ? " " Yes , we ought to get the publicity department in on this . Let Chris work full time on it . Maybe we can embarrass those bastards half to death ; this is 1947 , they ca n't get away with things like this . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note , sweetie . Call Anthony , and tell him I 'll be over at three for a haircut , will you ? John , you fill Chris in and when she 's got things organized , we 'll get together . Four-thirty all right ? " Kierzek rose . " All right , Don . Just one more thing . Why do n't you give Harry a call ? He 'd appreciate it . " " Have you called him ? " " Yes . Yesterday . " " Yeah , okay . Mabel , after this letter , get me Harry Ames on the phone . Thanks , John . Great thinking . We 'll give those bastards hell . C'm on , Mabel . " Kierzek left and returned to his office . Why in the hell did people have to be told to do the right thing , he wondered . It was all so simple . Harry wrote to the Lyceum , refusing to accept the consolation award . He turned in his novel , as far as he had gone , when he received the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was an all right deal as far as he was concerned . The publicity director , Chris Lumpkin , had worked overtime preparing a dossier on the case , for letters continued to flow . One judge on the panel who had selected Ames now wrote and asked him to accept the consolation money . Another judge who had been out of town wrote asking Ames to forgive them all . For the rest , there was silence . If ever in his weakest moments Harry had thought artists to be a tightly knit group , ever ready to back each other up in times of trouble , hep134knew now that it was a dream . Why in the hell did he keep giving people credit for things that never even crossed their minds . That kind of shit was for someone else , not Harry Ames . When Chris Lumpkin 's fact sheet on the Lyceum case turned up on Kermit Shea 's desk , he put his head in his hands , smoked two cigarettes and wished to hell that the paper had a book section . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to him . At his favorite bar he ordered a hot roast beef sandwich , his usual double of bourbon and two glasses of beer . He was worried . Supposethis sort of thing happened to every black man , woman and child in America every day ? Suppose it had been happening , supposeit would continue to happen ? There would be a reckoning ; there always was , as history proved . That awful balancing out of things . Nature . But what did one do ? Kermit Shea ordered another double of bourbon , drank it neat and caught a taxi . When he got out he hunted up a telephone book . Clutching the address in his hand , he walked swiftly until he came to the house , Harry Ames ' house . He rang the bell . When the door opened he took off his hat and moved slowly up the stairs . " My name 's Kermit Shea , " he said to the man at the head of the stairs he took to be Ames . Photographswere funny . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , you 're from the Telegram ? " " Yes . " Shea had gained the top of the stairs . He stood puffing and he did n't know whether it was from walking so fast , climbing the steps , emotion , or all three . They shook hands . Ames showed him in and offered him a drink which Shea refused . " I just came to say something , Mr. Ames . This morning we got some news from your publisher  --  about the Lyceum . I came to say that I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry for myself , I 'm sorry for white people , I 'm sorry for black people . I do n't want to be your enemy , and I sure do n't want you to be mine . I want peace for us , Mr. Ames , I want peace . I want to help make that peace , but I 'll be goddamned if I know'how . I do n't know what to do or say , except what I 've just done and said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a lot of people like me . They just have n't had four bourbons . " Shea turned . " Give Max Reddick my regards , will you ? " He started out of the room and down the stairs . Harry rocked back on his heels and came forward . He watched Shea go down the stairs . " Mr. Shea , " he called softly . Shea turned around without stopping . " Thanks , " Harry said . Harry returned to his dressing ; he was going to lunch with Zutkin . He thought of Shea . What a strange , exhilarating and at the same time depressing land , he thought . Only in America . C'm on , Harry , he told himself . Put the Stars and Stripes back in the locker ; you can always count on some of the bourgeoisie to join you , always . Harry Ames and Bernard Zutkin were lunching on the East Side , of course . What they should have planned was lunch at the Algonquinin the center of the front dining room . The lunch was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five judges who had not broken silence , since he knew each one personally , and asked if they were aware of what had happened to Ames . Yes , they had heard something . Did n't it make them angry that Kittings had overriddentheir choice ? Well , of course . What were they going to do ? Nothing . Zutkin had suggested that the panel be reconvened and that the judges demand that Ames be sent to Athens , or resign . The suggestion fell on deaf ears . Now Ames was going to Paris instead of Athens and Zutkin was going to give him some names . And during lunch Zutkin would pick up some quotes to use in an article he was doing . It was , really , an observation of how an author 's private life seemed more important to the world at large than his craft . Ames fit very well into that observation . Zutkin did not think the piece would attract a great amount of attention , but he wanted to do it anyway . A couple of days later badly written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers . Three reporters from the Criterion called Ames at different times for his side of the contretemps , but no copy ever appeared . Well , the Russians had their iron curtain , the Americans had one that was velvet ; you couldn'tp136hear it when it came down and you did n't believe it was there when you brushed up against it . The outlandish stories began to filter through to him . He was a pimp for his wife . He was drug addict . He was a pusher . He was a cockhound , and all his bitches were white . He was part of a Communist-inspired plot to create a web of interracial affairs and marriages along the Eastern seaboard . And they grew progressively sillier , the stories . To hell with them . All he wanted now was out , to Paris , France , for who with good sense would go to Paris , Texas ? The time was coming . Ten days after what the Lyceum called its ceremonial , and they 'd be gone , gone , man . One incident occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whatever person or persons had first cast him into the shadows . It began with a phone call as Ames was packing the trunks , following a lunch in Harlem at Big Ola Mac 's with Max . " Me , Chris . " " Oh , hello , baby . " He liked Chris , her husband Jerry . They did n't sweat over anything . A life was a life and they lived it the best way they knew how . " News . " Chris could be so goddamn businesslike . " You 've noticed that the Criterion has n't run anything ? " " Yes , after talking to all those reporters . " " The gal at the Lyceum said not to wait , because they would n't print anything whatsoever about the Lykeion . " " I 'm not surprised . " " Something else . Arthur Lawrence called . " Lawrence was a books columnist for the Criterion . " He wanted to know if you were homosexual . " " I see , " Ames said . How could a man feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you tell him , Chris ? "  | " I told him I did n't know , because I had n't slept with you . It 's still wide open , you see . " " Chris , you 're precious . What am I supposed to do , call him and lisp that I am one , and he 'll pass the word along and I 'll have it made , Athens and all the rest ? " " Is that what it smells like to you ? " " You 're goddamn right , that 's what it smells like . What right does that dried-up old sonofabitch have to ask about my personal life ? " " Down , boy , just laying out the terrain for you . Bumpy , is n't it ? " " Thanks , Chris . We 're ready to go . This can go to hell . " " Y'know , Harry , they really are rotten people . When I think of them sitting in their cold clubs or at their teas or cocktail parties , I get so goddamn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so nobody can get close to him . " " What could he say ? " " I goofed . How 's Charlotte ? The kid ? " " They 're holding up . " " Great . Got ta go , sweetie . See yuh . Lunch one day ? Call ? Love to the gang , " and she was gone . Harry Ames hung up slowly . Is Harry Ames a faggot ? Is Harry Ames a faggot ? He sat down . He felt as though a great many people had defecated on him . He wanted to strike out , but he knew if he did , he would not stop until he had killed . God , let us get out of here before it 's too late . I do n't want to have to kill someone . I do n't want to kill . Well , Paris would be different . Paris and , if everything went all right , Africa . His friend Jaja Enzkwu from Nigeria had sent him a note of consolationon the Lykeion incident . " In our new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to ask them for nothing . It is a prospect that pleases me immensely . The Black Mother will forever beckon to her sons in the West . It is good that you plan to come home . " It was good to know that there was , after all , somewhere to go if times got that hard . For Harry , times were pressingly hard . He would admit it to no one , but he hated to leave America , he hatedp138being driven out . No , they would never admit that they did that . But Harry Ames no longer believed , as they had taught him and his father and his father 's father , that he was a nigger . Once he had believed that he was everything the books had said ; worse even than what they said with their mouths , with their magazines and newspapers , with their radios , and he assumed that with this new thing , television , they 'd continue . For example , Amos ' n Andy would go over big . And Negroes themselves would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but get extremely angry about it ( Amos ' n Andy ) in public . Because they were still niggers . The worst stories about Harry and the Lykeion were written by the Negro press . The Democrat , for example , had not bothered to check out other Negroes who had been at the Lykeion . Sloppy , all of them , as if , that being the way the white man saw them , they would then be that way . But in the process , Harry knew , and he and Max had talked about it often , the Negro press deprived the Negro community of worthwhile newspapers . At least the Negroes were getting smart enough to buy the downtown papers ; they merely lied , they were n't just plain slovenly . Perhaps by the time he returned from Europe and Africa ( he did n't know when that would be ) , things would be different . He knew that Charlotte also felt ambivalent about going . A kind of surcease , yes , but at such a cost in money , energy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak French , for example ? They 'd just have to do it , a few necessary phrases first , and then others . Harry was confident that it would come ; they 'd be talking that shit up a breeze . The spring days whisked by . The American Lyceum of Letters ceremonial was approaching . Harry and Charlotte spent a great deal of time looking out of the window as if trying to memorize every shadow and the position of every light pole , the colors of the houses and doors on the other side of the street . At those times , Harry would study his wife 's face . Such a flitting sadness . She looked with such longing at the Italian ice vendors . But then she 'd lift her head and stare across the street . Envisioning , Harry imagined , Paris . Paris in the spring . ( Hell , she was a woman , wasn'tp139she ? ) Bittersweet the going , bittersweet the leaving . Harry turned from the windows . The good thing ( and he knew it was a desperate rationalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your goddamn toes . Made you think a little faster . Or else it was your ass . You lived once , but damned if they did n't make it seem like forever . Prometheus Black . Only they do n't know it 's fire they got , these American eagles . The night before the day of the ceremonial , Daniel O'Brien called . O'Brien was a poet and Harry had heard that O'Brien was the man who had been given his Lykeion Fellowship in creative writing . " Harry Ames ? I 'm Daniel O'Brien . " " Hello , Daniel O'Brien . " " Hi . About tomorrow . I 'm going to take that Fellowship . I did a lot of thinking about it , and I 'm going to take it . " " You 're a writer , I think you ought to take it . " " Yeah , well this is why I called : I 'm going to say a few words tomorrow . Can I say something for you ? " Harry heard the poet breathing regularly into the mouthpiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was the second choice and that you were the unanimous first choice . Maybe a couple of other things . Is that all right with you ? " " It 's all right , " Harry said . Why did n't they just leave him alone ? Why piss on him too ? " I 'm sorry , " O'Brien said , " but I want to go , I could n't turn it down . " " Sure , I understand , " Harry said . " Well , go ahead , say what you will . Good luck . " " Yeah , sure . S'long , Harry Ames . " The ceremonial was an especial one . Burke McGalpin had been dredged out of the Okefenokee Swamp and urged to set his bourbonaside . He was getting a special medal . It was somehow ironic that the Master of Southern Literature was to be at the ceremonial ; it was almost as if the Northern Literary Masters were saying top140him : " This is how we handle our niggers . Give a little , take much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they could listen to the broadcast together . Charlotte would listen to it at her mother 's house . Max was looking better , Harry thought , as they settled in the living room . He wished Max were going with them . Maybe later . Max had promised . Now , over the radio there came the blabbing of many voices which were faded under an announcer . Max glanced at Harry . The entire business had cut his ego to ribbons , but perhaps this was the end of it . There had been petitions , phone calls , conferences . Harry had stood firm in refusing the consolation prize  --  which was easy enough to do if you got a three-thousand-dollar advance . Well , Don Kenyon was no fool . All the copy would be good for his house and he 'd get a good book besides . He 'd always wanted to be a fighting publisher . Names were called off in monotone . Over the radio they heard the shuffle of feet , the scuffle of chairs , the sound of the mike being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the air . " Harry Ames declined the Lyceum Grant because he was refusedthe Lykeion Fellowship in Athens after having been the unanimous choice of the Lyceum judges . I was runner-up in the competition and therefore won it . " The voices babbled and bubbled again . Max was grinning when he looked at Ames . " That 's a gutsy cat , " he said . Harry looked out the window . " Max , do n't you know that guy 's dead ? He 's blabbed , he 's taken their money and he 's called them names . Yes , he 'll go on off to Athens for his year , and he 'll write poetry and maybe he 'll publish some of it . But that man is dead . They 'll get to him . They 'll make that poor sonofabitch sorry for trying to do the right thing . " Max said , " He should have kept his mouth shut . He did n't have to say a damned thing . " " Yes , he did , Max . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio . Neither of them moved for a long time.  |p143Now  , seventeen years later , Max remembered that afternoon , perhapsbecause it had been a spring afternoon . And Max remembered the kind of dazed look of Harry and Charlotte and the kid in their room on the Flandre . It 's not for real , the look seemed to say ; it ca n't be . Yet there they were , the odor of the North River full in the room , that room crowded with well-wishers , flowers , champagne , muted voices that ship departures always bring . Once Max had looked into a corner . He saw Harry and Daniel O'Brien raising their glasses . A toast , Max thought . To what ? One year later Max knew . It had been a toast to America . O'Brien had written a poem hinting at it , a poem that said if we must sacrifice some to get where we must go , then count me first . Harry had been right about O'Brien ; that was the last published poem of his Max had ever seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another half mile and Max peeled off the main road , shifted into third and moved slowly through the streets . Once he stopped to look at his directions , then drove on to the train station ; the street he was looking for was near it . Twice he missed it and had to double back on one-way streets . The third time he hit it just right , drove past a weatherbeaten wooden windmill ( left up for the tourists ) and went down the street until he came to the number Michelle Bouilloux had given him . There was a wall around the house . Max got out of the car and stretched . The first thing he 'd do was go to the bathroom ; the cotton felt wet . He glanced at the sun ; it was directly overhead . Noon , or just about ; it should n't have taken him that long to drive down here . He 'd do better going back , he thought . Max rang the bell . He breathed the scents of spring , the water in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ,  |p144faintly  , the exhaust fumes of cars . He heard the lock on the garden door snap open and he pushed at the ancient , browned slab of wood . In the garden , color rose layer above layer . First was the thick carpet of grass divided by a walk , then fern bushes and daffodils , then red and pink roses , all dwarfed by giant spreading oaks on either side . He almost missed seeing the house behind the flowersand plants , but he started down the walk , closing the door behind him . Up ahead , at the other end of the walk , the door of the old stone house opened , and Michelle Bouilloux rushed out , her red hair glinting copper as she ran toward him through the different levels of color . Max perceived her dimly , rushing out of the past as it were , and heard her shoes slapping ever so gently upon the old slate walk , and for the first time he smelled the flowers themselves . The black she wore this time was not so formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply cut dress her breasts heaved up and down with each crimping little stride she took toward him . He thought with surprise , She 's a redhead ! Of course , she was a redhead . He 'd known that once . Why had he forgotten ? It was just the day , the time of day , that hour in life through which all past thoughts and desires filtered once more . As she came closer to him , her ripe , reluctantly aging body still  --  ( how would he say it ? ) succulent ; un repas succulent  --  he noticed that she fixed his face with her eyes in such a searchingly bright manner that he inwardly recoiled , not from her , but from what it was she saw . " Hey , Michelle , ca va , cheri , umm , tres chic toujours , ah ? " Only by bracing himself was he able to take her crashing embrace without falling . I t was his own fault . He had thrown open his arms and thrust himself forward in a feeble attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugged and kissed again , until she drew back and let her eyes go over his face again . " Max , es-tu malade ? " " What ? " " I 'm sorry . Are you sick , Max ? I noticed in Paris that you did not look well . Now you are here  --  Max  --  you look worse . Come , I will fix you a coffee . " She took his arm and they walked to the house.  |p145As  soon as they entered Max said , " Michelle , I must use your bath . " " But of course , Max . " When he came out the coffee was ready along with neat little open-faced sandwiches . " You are hungry , Max ? " Michelle asked . He nodded . As she poured the coffee , he leaned to look out the window . A canal flowed right next to the house . He guessed it was a pretty cold place during the winter . The house was very old and extremely Dutch in style . " Is this your house , Michelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee . " Way in the back , " she said , " in history , one of my relatives was a soldier with Napoleon . Comingback from Waterloo , he simply stayed and took a Dutch wife . They built this and used it from time to time when they were not in France . But , " she added hastily , " we are far more French than Dutch . " As he was sipping his coffee , Max felt an urge to turn ; it was as if someone was looking at him . He looked up at a photograph of Harry Ames standing in a far corner on the mantel of the fireplace . Max turned and looked at Michelle , then back at the photo . It was Harry 's devilish photo . His eyes danced and his brows were arched like mountain peaks . " My husband never knew of this house , " Michelle said with a little smile . " It belongs after all to my family . " " So this is where you and Harry used to vanish to . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crossed one leg with a flash of white . " But , how have you been , Max ? Are you still with the magazine ? No more novels , Max ? What happened ? And Margrit , you saw her in Amsterdam . Is she well ? Is there any hope for you two or is there someone else ? " Max shrugged . " There 's no one else . Margrit ? She 's fine . The magazine ? What had he told Margrit ? That he had quit three months ago or  --  No I took a leave for a little while . I was getting tired , Michelle . Too much traveling , too many different countries and people and things in too short a time . Not like the old days , they say , before the jets . Just tired , honey . "  | " We always hoped you would come back to Paris and settle down to live , Max . So much was missing when you decided to return to America . Harry felt badly about it . You made him feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good feeling for him to have . Harry was not a good man to know when he was uncertain about things ; he thrashed about and he hurt people . And your swift passingsthroughwere never enough . " " Well . . . " Max let his voice fall off . Tired , he thought , damned tired . " I often had the feeling , " Michelle was saying , " that there were certain important things America could do or say in some fashion , and they would have been enough to send Harry rushing back to New York . America never said or did them . All day I 've been thinking : maybe he was n't happy in France after the first few years . Maybe he was n't . " Max said , " He never wrote about the French ; he never wrote about France , nothing in love , hate , anger or even indifference . Maybe he was wrong . " " His heart did lay in America , and one could always find time to reflect on that and be sorry  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sharply than he intended , because he was feeling a sudden lurch of pain even through the morphine . Anticipating it after the morning 's drive , he had increasedhis dosage in her bathroom . " Why are we here ? " Michelle closed her mouth slowly and firmly . Ah , he is not well , she thought ; that explains it . That must explain it . She glanced out the window . Max saw her in full profile . His eyes went down to her chest where her breasts swelled to bursting against her dress , then mercifully sloped back to her stomach . He was now conscious of her perfume , a faint something . Violet ? Michelle uncrossed her leg and crossed the other . She leaned forward and took a sandwich and glanced at the window again as she took a bite . Max waited , staring at the dark waters of the canal . Why did n't she get on with it ? " I have something to give to you . " She took another bite of her sandwich . Max , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p147watched  her open her small , rounded mouth . No lipstick . Fluttering like a newborn snake , his penis strained toward an erection . Max groaned and clutched his coffee , wincing . Michelle frowned . Her pout vanished and she came forward , setting her cup on the small table that stood between them . She touched his knee . He placed a hand over her hand and with the other wiped the stinging tears from his eyes . She looked up at him quizzically . " What , dear Max ? Tell me . You are ill. 0 ! Max ! " Her own eyes filled suddenly with tears . " We are all getting old and sick and dropping dead , with everything still a mess . " " Michelle , " Max said , trying to laugh lightly . " I never made love to a woman with red hair . Never in my entire life . " Michelle laughed a little through her tears . " Why , what an extraordinarything to say ! " She giggled . " Max , why do you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere between a wild high and stupor . " Would you let me make love to you if I were going to die and could complete that act just once before I did ? " Max smiled at her . Michelle smiled back . " But we are both so old  --  I would not like the responsibility of having your death on my hands , dear Max  --  " " I would do it for you , Michelle . " " You would ? " Michelle frowned and smiled by turn . What a strange conversation . How odd , how odd ! She stood and retrieved her coffee and then coquettishly said , " I might consider it . But enough of this game , Max . It frightens me . " She wiped the edges of her eyes with a tiny lace handkerchief . " Michelle , " Max said , feeling some of the tension ease from his body , " the mess was a long time in the making ; it 'll take a long time in the cleaning . Harry thought he could do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She went to a nearby cabinet and opened it and pulled out a worn leather briefcase . From her purse she took a key . She laid these on a sideboard . " I will have a whiskey , " she said . " This is allp148too depressing , to talk of love and death in the same breath . You , a whiskey ? " Max felt his head going forward and in a panic he jerked it back up . It took him the greater part of a second to focus and see if Michelle had been watching him . No . " Yes , I 'll have one , " he said . How many times had he seen junkies and cops standing within three feet of each other on Eighth Avenue and 125th Street , the junkies nodding just as he 'd started to , and the cops pretending not to see . " Water , " she said , " or soda ? " " Plain . " First she brought the whiskey and then the briefcase . She lay the key gently in his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , of course . Yes . " " Almost from the first , was n't it ? " Max remembered the letters : . . . and man , there is this French chick , with red hair ! ( You had one yet ? ) I 've never known a woman like her . . Michelle smiled shyly . " Yes , almost from the start . " She looked into her whiskey glass . " You should have seen him then ! " she cried fiercely , and Max saw that she was sobbing once more . Her voice began to wash back and forth over Max . Her gestures with her hands ( whiskey splashing in light brown arcs ) were like frightened little birds springing in a hundred different directions . Her face lighted up . She tossed her head . " He was like a breath of fresh air when he came , like the first strong smell of spring skipping along the Boulevard St-Michel . His eyes were big with seeing , and his heart , oh , Max his heart ! it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and farther ! We thought him the first true American existentialist , and I will never forget what he said at a party : ' Existentialist ? what is that ? ' Of course , he was kidding . But two of his books , I forget which ones , made us see America through eyes we 'd not used before . " He was very much in demand . He went to many parties and came to know Jean-Paul  --  he had just published the second boot of his Le Chemin de la Liberte  --  Simone , Albert , Jean Francoisp149Andre . " Michelle laughed , throwing up her feet . " And at one party he met your American star , the eh , eh , the bullfight man ? Yes , of course you know who I mean , but Harry would not talk to him , said , No American writer can be called great unless he deals with American themes , problems and aspirations . That man could write about losers so well and not even really know any ; he went here and there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet . Millions of them . ' We needed that then , with the war not long over and Dienbienphu still before us . We needed the confidence of someone who had taken more of a beating than we , generations and generations of beatings , and who could still see le chemin de la liberte . So Harry was not a good existentialist and sometimes we think Jean-Paul , beneath it all , is not either . Yes , France rolled out the red carpet as you Americans say , and I met Harry at one of those parties . My husband , you remember , was quite close to the Ministry of Culture . I saw Harry 's wife then and many times after . She seemed  --  petulant , that so many people were concerned for her husband 's work and concerned for him . I could tell right away she was not very good for him . What do you do to writers in Amer-ica ? " Michelle had had two more drinks by now , Max noticed through the soft , cottony gray cloud that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he also told himself that perhaps a nap would do him good . It was still early ; he would get back to Amsterdamin good time . Perhaps Michelle would even drive him there and take the train back . Do something ! Open the case . Pandora 's box , maybe . He thought he was laughing . Pandora 's box . Were those Greeks clever ! Talking all that hip Harlem trash for centuries . Pandora 's box . Yes , indeed . How did it go : " For Pandora carried a box which she was forbidden to open ; it would bring misfortuneto man . " Wow , Michelle , let me open your box . . . . Max ! You 're not drinking ! " Michelle reached for his ' lass and he slipped his hand over her wrist . Brown and white , he thought . Nice . She took the glass . " I 'll get you another and together We 'll drink one to Harry . "  | " No , Michelle , " he said . He tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his chair . The cottony gray fog now swept over him in thick , choking gusts . " No more Michelle . " He fingered the key to the case . It slid through his fingers as though it had been coated with graphite . He wanted to get a firm grip on it and he wanted to scratch himself at the same time . The nodding and the scratching  --  well , he knew what that was . Hours passed , it seemed , time telescoping as if it had resigned itself to the play of mirrors . Michelle was still standing motionless , the glasses of whiskey in her hands . Max blinked . The attache case on his legs suddenly became unbearably heavy and his knees began to quiver . The cold sweat was back , popping out on his forehead . He thought he smiled at Michelle . Finally , he thought he was putting the key in his pocket . " Michelle , " he seemed to be saying from some distance away . He cleared his throat and spoke louder . " Michelle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Max , what is it ? " She did things before she came to him . Putting the glasses down ? " What is wrong ? Of course you can lie down . I did not notice until now , I was so busy thinking of myself with Harry . But come . " Max leaned on her when he finally got to his feet . He leaned on her and felt her breasts pressing into his chest . With an unsteady hand he touched one , slipped his hand around on it until he felt the nipple . " Stop . Be a good boy , Max . Give me the case to carry . " " I can carry it . " They struggled up the stairs . " I hope this does n't disturb any plans you might have made . " " No , no , it is quite all right . Shall I get a doctor ? " " No , Michelle . I know what is wrong . " They were near the top of the stairs now . " What ? " Michelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts in slow motion . They paused , breathing heavily . Max took his hand from her breast and tilted her chin to his mouth and clumsily kissed her ,  | " What is wrong with me is what is wrong with all of us . I 'm simply dying . Like you . Like everyone . " " Shhh , " she said , helping him into the bedroom , to the bed and then removing his shoes . " Why do you make such jokes , Max ? You do worry me . Another kiss , Max ? Oh , Max , should we get so ? A little one , Max , no more . " Max was being washed up in it , the unzipping of her blouse , the mute struggle to unclasp the brassiere , the wide , heavy-tongued kisses and finally , the stark , white , fat breasts tumbled out and hung formlessly before him . Michelle had remained motionless , as if sensing that this was something he must do , and he sensed that and stopped . Yes , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back inside her blouse . He heard a long dry stroking somewhere . He listened very carefully and heard sparrows in the yard downstairs . Then he knew what the sound was , the rubbing of a giant limb against the house . Breathing deeply and not looking at him , Michelle raised herself from the bed . " It is not much good without the love , Max , is it ? After a while , the cliches have meaningonce again . " " Yes , Michelle . " Pain had been riding hard between Max 's buttocks , now it was subsiding . Max started to fall between the gray clouds as Michelle 's voice came distantly to him . " There is an awful smell , Max . Do you smell it ? Could a small animal from the garden be caught in the eaves and rotting ? Max , do you think so ? " She snapped her brassiere and zipped up her blouse . " I do n't know , " Max whispered . She leaned over and kissed his cheek . " Sleep , Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind her softly . He heard her going slowly down the stairs . The smell , the cancer smell of rot and death . Sort of sweet , sort of heavy , sort of like being near a corpse on a battlefield and not even seeing it . The senses , like those of a beast , remember the smell of death . Max winced in pain and fear . Now he was just like anyone else . Mortal . Stinkingly mortal . Until Michelle had spoken he had pretended that the smell was not his.  |p152His  falling was slow and he did not know whether it was from the morphine and whiskey or the inevitable cachexia or all three . Why could n't he have died on one of those wet , naked Italian mountains ? There were so many decent ways to die , so many acceptableways to die . It would have been romantic to die of drink after Lillian . Or pills . A hunting accident . ( " I thought he was a deer , Mr. Coroner . " ) Starvation in the richest city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same year Harry Ames arrived in Paris like a breath of spring . MAX had read Harry 's letter in the Pork Store while he was waiting for the man to wrap up the ham hocks . Harry was having a ball in Paris . That redhead he always wrote about . And all the famous French writers he 'd met . Goddamn , Max thought , I 'd like to talk to that Camus . That 's a tough cat . That Harry . Luck . Now Max was walking back home , through a late September sun . Pretty soon of Hawk would be on the scene and all these cats standing on these corners lying and crying would have their asses cut a duster . The corners would be clean . Yes , sir . You could always tell when wintercame to I larlem . Nobody on the street . Max clutched his bag containing two smoked ham hocks . His mouth watered . It was his day to eat and waiting at home was half a pot of navy beans soaking in water . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room with a small closet and even smaller bathroom . There was a sagging , high-rise bed , a battered table and two chairs and a dresser whose veneer peeled every time someone in the building slammed a door . Max 's savings were gone . Whiskey , he guessed , and flowers for Lillian 's grave . There was the 52-20 club money and the ten percent disability . At home Max moved to the table where his manuscript lay very near completion . He hummed . If he had found a job , he would n't have finished thep153book so quickly ; the book had kept him sane . Outside , downtown , they had rejected him completely and he had crawled back into his hole . Not to die , but to begin to live any way he could . Survival , Harlem style : when the wagon comes , every swinging goes . Morals in an immoral society ? Later for them . One way or the other Max Reddick was going to make do , and further , make it . Hell , he had him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some money and some trim later . Max washed off the hocks and placed one in the freezer compartment . The other he placed in the pot of navy beans after he had drained the water and replaced it . He put a pack of cigarettes on the table and sat down to work . He worked until the smell of the beans and hocks came from the pot , then he rose , tasted them , added seasoning and sliced an onion into the pot . The beans were getting soft and the hock was still in one piece , although its flavor had gone through the beans and colored them a light brown . Close to an hour later when he left the typewriter again , Max removed the ham hock , rinsed it off and placed it in a saucer to cool . Later he would wrap it in aluminum foil and place it in the refrigerator to be used the next day when he made kidney beans . And when he finished the kidney beans , he would use what was left of the hock for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his beans seasoned for about six days . Then he would start on the other hock , using it just as judiciously with cabbage , string beans and collard greens . Two ham hocks and less than two dollars ' worth of dried and fresh groceries kept Max going for half a month . Luxuriously , he gorged himself on the beans and bread with thick slabs of butter . He wondered if he had not been Negro if he could have survived so well in a place like New York . He lit a cigarette and lay down . It was Saturday . From somewhere in the building he could hear a ball game in progress . Soon football would take over . Max liked it when it was quiet like this . He knew people were out , walking or sitting in the parks . Weekends made him feel better because hardly anyone worked . During the week he had to fight being embarrassed because everyone else in the city , itp154seemed , was hustling toward work while he dragged around at home . He had got over that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had his . That 's all there was to it . The girl came later that afternoon . Her name was Regina . Max had met her on the ship the day Harry and Charlotte left . He had gone drinking with her and her date , Bob , until Bob had to catch a train home . To his wife and children . Max and Regina had had more drinks and he took her home , made love to her and a thing of sorts was begun . Max knew that she still saw Bob . That was all right because she knew he saw other girls . When she was troubled about Bob , she came to him . He would punish her for being involved with a married man . What greater punishment could there be than to be involved with a Negro man and giving him money ? Max had already given himself a name ; he was a pimp without briefcase . When you pimped without briefcase , you borrowed money from the girl and the girl knew you 'd never pay it back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrow more money . Sometimes you apologized for not being able to pay the money back and if you did this right , not only would the girl not become middle class and bitchy and dun you for the money , she might even lend you more . Later , in Europe , they would call it macking . Regina ( Max remembered ) had been in a quietly belligerent mood . " Beans and hocks again , " she said . Then she sighed . " If I were coming again I 'd bring you a steak . " " You 're not coming again , Regina ? " " No , not anymore . I 'm not even staying over tonight . " " I see . " Max wondered what had brought it on . He had counted on the ten bucks . " Do you want to tell me why ? " " I do n't mind , Max . " She touched his hand . " You do n't think I know what I 'm doing , do you ? " " I 'm sure somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all right ? " " Sure . " " Well , it 's not any good without love , Max , and I do n't love you and you do n't love me . We just  --  well , we just ! "  | " Everybody just justs , Regina . " " Well , I do n't want to just just ! I want something more . " " Like Bob ? " " Just like Bob . " " Can you have him ? " " No . I mean , sometimes I think no , and he says no , but when we 're together it 's yes . But when he hurts me I  --  " " You come to me . " " Yes . " " I understand . It 's part of the game . " " Max , I know it 's part of your game , our game . But no more . Listen , ca n't we somehow be friends ? I know it sounds like nonsense , but I mean it . " These girls who work in publishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You just ca n't shake hands , Regina , and say , Okay , we 're friends now , ' you know . " " Oh , I know it , " she said , placing her face in her hands . She got up and took her bag . " If it 's to come , it 'll come , but let 's shake anyway . " " I 'd rather kiss you . " " No . A shake , Max . Do n't be like everyone else . Please shake . I 'm tired of passion . " Regina and the other girls made him feel a part of things . Now , for this weekend at least , loneliness . No , he tried to tell himself , the book , the book . He 'd be working , working like hell . He reached out and took her hand . She stood in the door and said , " Think of how you 'd be if you had your Lillian ; I know how I 'd be if I had Bob . " Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He laid out the manuscript and inserted paper into the typewriter . He worked easily and steadily , pausing from time to time to listen to the news or to light a cigarette . He thought of the city , monstrous and writhingbeneath the weight of people running pell-mell in search of pleasure . No one looked for pain or , if they did , they were careful first to drape it in pleasure . Finally , a gray sheen fell across his window ; morning had come . The phone had not rung once . Eightp156million people in the city and not one of them had thought to call . Not a single one . He bounced up from the table . What the hell was he thinking like that for ? Everybody else had been balling  --  all eight million of them  --  but he had been working . I 'm nuts , he told himself . Or going nuts . He fixed a cup of instant coffee and carefullystacked his sheets . Work , Max ! he told himself , Go , baby ! While he sipped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe that was the answer , Paris , Europe . White people , sure , but maybe a different kind of white people . Good enough for Harry . No , do n't believe it . Dump five hundred thousand niggers on Paris streets and it 'd become just like New York . But , maybe , Max thought , if I ever get in any kind of shape . . . Maybe this book will take off . Max shook his head . The goddamn city was so filled with cliches that you started thinking they were your own golden words . Some agent had used that phrase , " take off . " Max knew that no book took off unless it was first catapulted by the publisher . The gray sheen outside was taking on a slight orange hue . How nice it would be in the country now , breaking through the brush and surprising the pheasant , the big game , as they broke their sleep for water and food . Got to get in the country soon . This city is killing me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have wished for , but Regina had been there , could have been there if he had talked her into staying , but she had been right . Games , there had to be something else . He lowered his window shade and got into bed . It seemed that he had slept only five minutes when the phone woke him up . " This is Granville Bryant . Max Reddick ? " Bryant , Max thought . " Did I wake you ? " " Well . . . " " I hear you 're looking for a job , Max . How 've you been ? " " All right , except for the job . " " You need a good publisher too . " " Yeah , " Max said , laughing.  | " Did I say something funny ? " " Oh , no . I 've only been looking for a job since last winter . As for the publisher , ha-ha . " " I know . It 's terrible . " " You have a job , Granville ? " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fags . They had their games too . " Well , yes , Max , but I wondered if you should take something that 'll keep you from your work . " Their solicitousness kills me , Max thought . They could starve you and later say they were doing it so you could become proficient in your art . They 've got all the answers , white folks . Well , Max , welcome to the round-eye set , the shitpacker crowd ; maybe I ca n't get out of this hole ( ha-ha ) until I make that route . " Granville , I need a job . Besides , the novel 's just about finished . " " Oh ! is it really ? Splendid , Max ! Are you pleased with it ? " No , Granville , it 's a rotten novel . I helped kill my girl because I wanted to write a rotten novel . I like ham hocks and beans and cabbage and collards for a daily diet , Granville , so I can write rottenbooks . But Max said , " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine is starting a new daily . He 's gatheringstaff now . It will be somewhat left , but you do n't mind that , do you ? And Max was thinking : How can a broke nigger mind anything ? He 's not interested in what a man 's color is . He 's read your work and the pieces you did for that Harlem paper and he 'd like to see you , if you 're interested . " " I 'm interested . " " I 'll give you his number then . And say , you know Marion Dawes , do n't you ? " Dawes was the young Negro writer who 'd gotten such a rave review in the Times . " I do n't know him , " Max said . " I know of him . " It was important to make the distinction . " I see . I wondered if you 'd be good enough to give me Harry 's address in Paris so I can give it to Marion  --  he was shy about calling you . Marion is planning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in touch with Harry . "  |p158Max  kept thinking , Harry ai n't gon na like this , of Harry ai n't gon na like it at all . " You know , " Bryant was saying , " Marion has gotten a fellowship , so he 'll be able to skimp through in Paris . But perhaps Harry will be able to help him with some contacts . " " Sure , " Max said . Those bastards . They really looked after their own . " What kind of fellowship ? " " A Laurentian . " " Nice , " Max said . " I wonder what I have to do to get one . They seem pretty hard for some people to come by . " Bryant laughed . " It does take a little luck . " And a little suck , Max thought . " That 's all , huh ? " Bryant laughed again . " As far as I know , Max . My ! You do seem out of sorts . Really , I did n't mean to wake you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've never been out of work nine months before . It upsets me a little . " " Yes , " Bryant said . " I 'm sorry for that . Max , I 'd like to have lunch with you sometime . I know you do n't like me , but for a couple of hours  --  it wo n't hurt will it ? " Max beat a retreat . " What do you mean , I do n't like you ? " " Come now . Both you and Harry . I know that . " " It 's not that , Granville , " Max said weakly . " Well , let 's talk about it another time . After you 've spoken to Julian Berg . Remember , " Bryant said mockingly , " the lunch wo n't hurt . " " So all those liberal bastards could n't between them find a job for you , huh ? " Julian Berg spoke as if he were musing to himself . He was a round little man with graying hair and light blue eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewishness . " I supposethis paper will be called liberal . That 's a pity , because from the position of the others , we have to be . Everybody on his dot , like dancers . Okay . We 'll take the label . " Berg grimaced . " So you wo n't misunderstand . I want you on this paper because , number one , I want a Negro , as many as I can get . This is not pure altruism , Max.  |p159There  're whole segments of this town that have no voice . I 'm concerned with Jews and Negroes . You can help me with Negroes and Jews and readers in general . Some Jews are reading the Times , the well-to-do . Too many Jews and Negroes are reading the reactionarypress because they do n't know the difference in papers . There 's another view of things yet to be presented . That 's our job , that 's the New York Century . If you want the job , Cityside and specials , it 's yours . " " I want it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Max resigned himself to it ; he was pretty much like everyone else . No job , panic or depression or both swiftly followed . Truly middle class , he thought . I need to work . Perhaps with the publication of the next book he could stop working . In the pig 's rump . He liked the way Berg was handling him . Max covered all kinds of human interest stories . The City Hall beat followed and , briefly , theater and books . Mostly it was Cityside , where he became familiar with the reporters of the other papers , the neat , young Timesmen , always dark-suited and soft-spoken , cerebral . The Tribmen were cerebral without the dark suits and better drinkers . The reportersfrom the Mirror and the News seemed ashamed of themselves , while the men from the Journal and World-Telegram &; Sun , constant , not quite plodders , drinkers in the old tradition , like French cabdrivers right after lunch with the hooch still curling around their mouths , were solid , underrated newsmen . Criterion reporters were not cerebral or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was late and never missed an important news conference . The others , on a first-name basis with the whole range of public figures , were always late . But no matter , they could debrief Max Reddick of the Century , who was always on time . Handouts , follow-up calls and Max Reddick , and the story was covered , then written mentally in the nearest bar and given ten minutes on the typewriter at the office . Max did n't quite know how to handle the situation . There were two alternatives , of course . He could refuse to float any more of his material ( the juicy color and meat no re/porter gave away anyhow ) or he could continue as he was , hoping that , if ever he became bored or lazy or ill , then he might be able to debrief other reporters . Max chose the latter alternative through the months , picking up in the meantime plaques from the NAACP and the National Urban League and B'nai B'rith for " superior reporting , " but really for being a Negro reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been the first few months , being stopped by guards and police and doormen , being refused entrance to press conferences until the Century office was called and his connection with it verified . Winter hit hard and was followed by a sullen spring , during which he thought of Lillian . He wondered now how it would have been with the writing . ( He was riding the crest of anticipation . The new book would be out in early fall . ) Would he have accomplished so much ? On the other hand , was n't this job for her , for her memory ? He had done it ; he had secured the kind of job she believed he deserved . Aha , baby ! I did n't get it by deserving ; I got it by knowing ! Fags ! ( God , I must call Granville . ) If this book makes a nickel ( he was still thinking ) instead of buying a new car  --  zap ! in the bank . Think France . Yes , think France . Six months , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move around a little , see just what it is all these niggers are raving about . The city seemed to give a heavy , concrete sigh of relief with the coming of September . Labor Day had passed . The department stores were filled with parents readying their broods for school and children bent on spending every penny their parents had not alreadyspent on camp and trips to Grandma 's during the summer . The accidents on the road seemed to have been particularly gruesomeover the Labor Day weekend ; Max had covered three . But now the dead were buried , the injured attached to splints , blood , dextrose and in hospital beds . Football was poised to replace baseball , and quite suddenly , Max thought of Regina . He had spoken to her last Christmas and had decided then that perhaps it would be better if he did n't call her and if she did n't call him . But Max wad feeling gracious and expansive . Maybe he was ready to be friendsp161with her now ; ready to suffer lunches and dinners and long talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward . Max had never known a woman with whom he wanted that kind of relationship . Regina was different . He called her . " I 've been waiting for you to call , " she said . " I wondered how long it would take . Almost a year exactly , right ? " What about last Christmas , Max wondered ? He said nothing about it . " I 've been reading you , of course , " she went on , " and I read your new book in galleys . I have a friend at your publisher . " It pleased Max to know that she had been thinking about him ; he was glad he had called . " That 's your best book so far , Max . You should be proud of it , I am . But most important . Did you call because you 're feeling horny or are we friends ? We are , are n't we ? " " Honest Reg , this was just a friendly call . How are you ? How 's Bob ? Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . I think I 'm getting used to it . Could n't we have dinner tonight ? I 'd like to see you and talk to you . It 's been a long time . " " That 's just why I called , " Max lied , although he would not mind the dinner or seeing her again . He felt proud of himself . He had n't called because he wanted to get into her drawers ( although he knew and she knew it too , that if she felt inclined to take them off for him he would n't have said no ) . He could n't explain to himselfhis feeling for Regina . When she wanted to be friends why had n't he said , " It 's been nice , later ? " Maybe she saw him coming , too . Regina Galbraith ( formerly Goldberg ) had been the sole member of her family spirited out of Nazi Germany . The rest were dead . Gassed and cooked , most likely . From what she 'd told him , they were nice people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They would not have died in isolation , say , in an escapeor during the murder of a prison guard . Those acts were in quarantine ; they were not for those who needed the safety of a group . Regina went first to England and spent a few months in the London home of a mammoth , brusque woman . From there to Scotland . ( Max had often pictured her , a small , puzzled child , stillp162speaking High German , her head swiveling from side to side in order to see it all , her face a blank as her mind interpreted what the adults around her were saying by placing their words in a context with time of day , expressions on their faces , how loudly or softly they spoke . ) She spent many years in Scotland and then was sent off to Australia . Years later , a young woman in her twenties , she arrived in the United States via San Francisco and thence to New York where she charmed everyone with her Scottish accent . " How was the year for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tempted to call you Christmas . It was too much for me again . " You did call , Max thought , sadly , and it would have been too much . Christmas , Chanukah , Bob in the bosom of his family ( yours dead ) , Bob in someone else 's pants besides hers and his wife 's . Well , it was all a part of Regina 's thing , apologizing to hell and back for being alive with the rest of her family dead . The holidayswere bad . Then ( she had told him ) she usually checked into a mental clinic , or friends did it for her , afraid of what she might do to herself after her ten-times-a-night calls . " Hi , there ! This is Regina Goldberg Galbraith . Oh , you know who this is . Well ! Merry Christmas ! Happy Chanukah ! God , I feel so lonely . What are you doing tonight ? I thought you might take a few moments out to talk to me . It 's good I have a friend like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where will you go Christmas ? What will you do ? Max it was the call last Christmas we are friends , right ? You 'd let me talk to you anytime if I needed someone to talk to , would n't you ? I 'd let you talk to me anytime if you were a little ill . I mean , if we were very good friends , true friends . Last night , Max , I called a man , just to talk to . I was very ill . " ( Max had not asked if it was Bob . ) " He said he would come over and stay with me for a while . I said not to sleep with , I did n't want to sleep with him , and he said yes , he understood and he came over and after a while we were on the rug , the red rug on my floor , and he made me go put in my diaphragm and we both got naked and he made lovep163to me on the rug , oh , he fucked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very dirty , dirty , Max , ohhhh , so dirty , and I thought he would stay with me after that , but he got up and left and I cried and cried , then I got up to look for my pills , but I must have hidden them from myself or  --  maybe he took them ! Yes ! He took them from the medicine chest ! Max listened and felt a chill creepingupward from the middle of his spine until it fuzzed somewhere in the front of his head . Now I have no more pills ! " She said the last , Max remembered , with a scream . She had continued to scream and moan and Max had tried to calm her down . " Max ! I need someone now ! Come over , Max . I 've no pills , what 'll I do , what 'll I do ? " " Whiskey , " Max had suggested . She dropped the phone . He could hear her drinking from a bottle . " Come talk to me , Max . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't call Bob . Stay out of that mess . Besides , he would start wondering . She could n't either . Max had sat and listened , insertinga word here and there when he could . He knew he should have gone to be with her through the night . How well he knew that . But , suppose she continued screaming and moaning even if he were there , and finally the neighbors called the police . Sure , try and get out of that one . A half-naked girl ( he assumed ) , out of her mind , her gray eyes bulging with fear and incomprehension , and a spade cat sitting there . Shit , he 'd be in more trouble than she . No , he did n't need that . He listened to her a long time , then he hung up without a goodbye . It was after the New Year before he could think of her without a great deal of remorse . He had told himself over and over again that he had n't made the world ; he just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his press card , but , so what ? He was still a spade who was driving a nice young white girl to madness , they would think . And there was no certainty that Regina would not have led them on with her rantings . But she had forgotten , or rather , she had not remembered thep164Christmas call . Max said , " I was away anyhow , Christmas . I was hoping it would be better for you . What about the Christmas com-ing ? " " Oh , do n't . I do n't want to think about it . " " Okay , then , let 's arrange to meet for dinner , " he said , but he was thinking , A black man sorry for a white woman . A sucker for the people who hurt . Who 's a sucker for me ? But then the world was gleefully crashing its way toward a kind of Jewishness . The war , the horrors of that war , had done it . Jewish comics were stomping out of the Catskills and clustering around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the land . Yiddish phrases were becoming national catchwords . The nation ( and the world ) was guilty about what had happened to the Jews in Germany . Therefore , we will take this Jewish thing and , finally , make it American . Forgive us for the delay , Sholem Asch and Henry Roth . Better late than never . And there was Regina . Who did what about her , bubi ? The day after dinner with Regina ( she told him that Bob was doing so well with his painting  --  he 'd had two successful shows in two months  --  that he was thinking of buying a house in Manhattan , to her delight ) , Berg summoned Max to his office . The Century ( quite naturally , Max reflected now ) was for Wallace . The defection of Southerners from the Democratic Party to form the Dixiccrats made the question of Truman 's election more than unlikely . Dewey looked like a shoo-in for the Presidency . " We 're giving you Wallace headquarters in town , " Berg said . He seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't look at Max . He kept looking for the paper , but really , he was waiting . Max knew he was waiting . It was an important assignment . There were more experienced political writers on the paper . And Max also knew the assignment would entail the digging out of Jews and Negroes high up in the Wallace hierarchy . Portraits , color . He said aloud , " Jews and Negroes , portraits , color . " Berg stopped looking for his paper . He turned a dour eye on Max . " Oh , Max . Oh , Max . Say it with sincerity . " Berg broke into ap165sheepish grin . " Guess you know the paper pretty well by now . " He broke off the smile . " That 's exactly what we want , Jews , Negroes , portraits , color . If you can catch Wallace , we want to know about the abolition of the poll tax , enforcement of the statutes calling for the end of Jim Crow in interstate travel , the continuing apprehensionand conviction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to expand the Marshall Plan or drop it as soon as he gets a chance . Okay ? " " Okay . And thanks . " The Wallace people relied heavily on dramatics . Theirs was an uphill campaign . From the first it was not directed against Truman ; Dewey was the target . Wallace , the thin man with the long face , the stiff , sweeping mop of hair , the toothy , embarrassed , adolescent grin , attracted young people  --  and , Max noted at the time , the younger veterans of the war . There was a certain vibrancy to the campaign , the kind only underdogs wage . Pete Seeger , Paul Robeson , blacks and whites . There were spotlights in a thousand high school auditoriums that cut through the darkness with the speed and force of a knife wounding the eye to disclose Henry Agard Wallace . The volunteers and staff people worked around the clock . Many nights Max left headquarters , leaving Regina behind with other volunteers who had come in from full-time jobs to ink the mimeographmachines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day . But dramatics , spotlights , guitars and folk songs were not enough ; nor were crowds of young people dancing in blue jeans . That was when blue jeans came to have their first bad connotation , because the people wearing them , the folk singers , brethren of the people and prebeatniks , were for Wallace . Long , long before ElectionDay the outcome was foreseen through that mysterious Americandevice , the poll , the polls and talk ; talk and the lack of money in the Progressive camp ; the lack of money and the snowballing whisper campaign about the Communists flying high on the Wallace coattails . Tom Dewey 's star rose higher and higher . The Dixiecrats were going to hurt Truman , wound him mortally . Dewey all thep166way . The Gangbuster , the Governor . Truman ? President by accident . Wallace ? Even Roosevelt had kicked him out . Dewey all the way . It seemed to Max that Wallace started to quit in October ; the fire was cooling . Papers like the Century were few and damned far between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallace be able to trust if he got in ? There was all of that and more . It was the black and the white . The sudden equality in 1948 ( much too early for America ) . It was the deep fear of that as well as anything else . Henry A. Wallace went quietly that November Tuesday , quietlyand early . Harry Truman retired in the Muehlebach Hotel in Kansas City and everybody felt sorry for him , thinking that when he woke the next morning , he would have two and a half months left in the White House . Max Reddick felt sorry for him , crusty little bastard , haberdasher , symbol of the American dream , little guy gone big . Max preferred Truman to Wallace . Wallace had too much to think about ; Truman took a step at a time and took it decisively and later for the rest of you cats . Who really could like Tom Dewey ? The polls told the story on Wednesday morning , the same day Truman woke and fired his Secret Service chief who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost the Election . Max had laughed his ass off ; it was just like Truman . Then it was all over . In Leiden , high on the morphine , Max laughed softly and clutched his paining rectum . How naive he had been then . It had not been over with Wallace , it had just begun , that pulsating , murderousdesire to be near or in politics , for that was where power was . Politics was some American game ; it had its pauses , but never an end . It was the Ultimate Game , while you lived . It had sent people back to where they came from ; it killed others and drove still others to the psychiatric wards or alcoholic clinics . It was where one learned the sorry truth about his countrymen . For example , Stevenson 's great losses to Ike brought forth the terrifying realization that unless the people could have a rich Presi/dent who had had the leisure to study their problems and learn the right phrases and how to utter them ( the European heritage  --  a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make do generally with someone pretty much like themselves . A five-star hero , perhaps , who , from the age of eighteen or nineteen had only to answer the call of a bugle to be fed , clothed and provided water for washing for most of his life , with time out for other jobs which were equally unfamiliar , until they made him their President . A man in their image . There was no faking that image , as Humphrey could tell anybody ; it was no good rambling about the old days as a druggist . Kennedy had put the spurs to that concept of the good old guy next door . Max had been an incurious Democrat , but had never thought of himself as a politician , in fact , not even a good , Northeast variety Democrat . But the co-speechwriting , the tremor of Washington , the cold , steely scent of power had touched him . The social crisis that loomed black over the land had attracted him , but now Max wished that it had n't turned out the way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the Wallace campaign. " . . . now bests his master , Harry Ames . . . " " The Tribune here Harry wrote says you 're better than me . Do you believe it . . . ? " Letters from Harry were few after that . When they came they were unexpected , and therefore they threatened . They contained no warmth . It was just as well , for Max , in a manner he never would have admitted , was weary of being compared to Ames , to Bolton Warren , and now , to Marion Dawes , who was in Paris . The critics and reviewers were unrelenting because , Max concluded , they did not know what they were doing ; and because they were supposedto be knowledgeable people , they 'd never admit to an ignorance of discrimination . The effect was the same . White writers were compared only to other white writers ; black writers were compared only to other black writers.  |p168Max  was deep in bitterness when he received a call from Kermit Shea , who was now a senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was no longer a hot roast beef sandwich and two double-bourbon man . Now he ate two-hour lunches at the best French and Italian restaurants in midtown . His suits were pressed , his shoes polished , his hair neatly combed . Now he wore glasses with complexion-tone frames . He was a different kind of newsman . " I 'm glad you got the break with Century , " he said . " And of course , I 've read your book . We gave it a good review . " Max remembered the lead . It had been about Harry Ames . " Who were you writing about , me or Harry Ames ? " " Yeah , yeah , I noticed that too , " Shea said . " Well , a review in Pace , good or bad , does n't hurt sales , you know . " And Max knew it . Shea chewed his food slowly ; he had expected some bitterness . " You know , we 've already had some discussion at the magazine about opening up , the way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'd like to be able to throw your name in the hopper when the time comes . " Max made him work . He listened and nodded or said nothing . He spoke only enough to keep the conversation from dying . He kept thinking : Kermit Shea , white , senior editor , Pace . Western Reserve , class of ' 37 . Italian campaign , Stars and Stripes . Age , thirty-four . Future , a snap . Why ? White . Max Reddick , black , city reporter , the Century . Western Reserve , class of ' 37 . Italian campaign , infantryman . Age , thirty-four . Future , doubtful . Why ? Black . " You mentioned Ames . What do you hear from him ? " " He 's all right . " " Is he coming back ? " " I do n't know . Why ? " " Well , I mean , things are . . . you know what I mean . " " Yes , I know . " Max lit a cigarette . Seeing Shea again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the old pains.  | " Do you think he should come back ? Would you , if you were him ? " " I do n't know what I 'd do if I were him , " Shea said . " But he was born here . It 's his country . You care for it  --  " " I care for it ? Kermit , this is my day for not giving one good fuck where or how this country goes . I could n't care less . " " You ca n't mean that . " " Am I really permitted to be as conscientious about these things as you ? C'm on , Kermit . Since when ? " Shea waited before answering . " I should think you 'd be even more concerned . What if you inherit ignorance and indecision , as I have ? " " Well then , whose fault is that ? " Then Max saw him climbing Harry 's steps once more and remembered Harry telling him about what Shea had said then . " My mood is foul today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these things . Tell me about the job . And tell me , does Pace pay more than the Century ? " He saw Shea start to relax . At one point he thought , He would be good for Regina . Never seen him with a woman . What 's his bag ? Max 's publisher was giving a party for the publication of his book . He would invite Shea and Regina . And Granville . That would take care of that obligation . As the lunch was breaking up , Shea said , " Army-Notre Dame . Saturday at the Stadium . I 've got two tickets I lifted from the Sports people . What do you say ? " The man wo n't let go , Max thought . What 's the matter with him lie wo n't let go ? But he said , " Sure . Pick you up ? " " Twelve-thirty . " It had been a different kind of meeting . Max had not been broke , distressed with a girl , or in the pit of a depression still finding its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , been muted . He had called a halt to the conversation about " conditions . " Once , he would have allowed Shea to continue talking about them . No more . 1 le knew about the conditions . They had cut him to ribbons , but he had not died . Instead ( thanks to Granville ) he now stood heavilyp170on his own two feet . The book helped too ; a book always did . Well , then . If Shea wanted to unburden his soul , let him find someone else ; if he wanted to hang around , goddamnit , he was going to hang around like a man , not a creep ! At the party for the publication of his book , Shea turned out to be a very shy man , which amused Max . It was Regina who did the wooing , hurtling into this new thing with the force of a bird trying to escape captivity . When last he looked , it seemed to be going okay . He talked for a long time with Zutkin , whom he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there with a young man who stood silently at his side and listened to his conversation without expression . It was Bryant who , midway through the party , said , " Is he your only Negro friend , Max ? " Bryant gestured toward Roger Wilkinson , who was indeed the only other Negro beside Max present . Max laughed briefly . " They were invited , Granville , they were in-vited . " " Why did n't they come ? " Annoyed , Max shrugged and moved away . How in the hell did he know why they had n't come ? He had worked hard on the invitationlist to bring about a balancing of white and Negro friends . He hated to do that . To secure the right balance he had set down the names of Negroes he did n't really like . Like Harry , he thought , I 've become the marginal man . Where were they ? Had he alienated every single one of them at precisely the same time ? How ? Glumly he watched Regina and Shea , then Roger Wilkinson talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young writer ; perhaps Bryant could be of use to him . Of course , Roger knew what he was doing . Max had had that feeling ever since his first meeting with Roger , who had thrust himself on Max , asking him to read manuscripts , discussing this writer and that one , eagerly writing down the advice Max half-heartedly gave him . What was wrong with Wilkinson , Max suddenly realized as he took another Scotch from the tray , was that he liked names . He thought they gave medals for readingp171Stendahl and Giraudoux and Auden and Henry Adams . He was a walking encyclopedia of famous and obscure writers , the good ones . ( " Honest , Max , that Andreyev is something else ! " ) Goddamn it , why had n't they come ? Now he knew . He had been lucky . He had made it , they thought , and that made him less Negro ; that made him no longer one of them . Dick Ricketts , the policyman in Harlem , greeted him in the uptown bars with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max had told him more than once that writers made money if they were lucky , or said what other people wanted them to say . Ricketts , sharp yellow face taut , lidless reptile eyes cold so that you could n't tell if they were comprehendingor not , listened carefully , then said , " Okay , baby , you tell it your way . I know them white folks do n't publish your books because they like you ! " Max had told him he had it all wrong . " But dig , man , " Ricketts had gone on , his handmade suit falling about him like gray velvet , his shirt open at the neck , a little gesture to establish and maintain rapport with the nickel-and-dimers , his Aston-Martin double-parked outside , unticketed on 125th Street , for every cop knew it . " And you writin ' for Mister Charlie 's paper too . Do n't I see your name in the paper ? How you sound ? C'm on here and let me buy you a taste even though I know you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got jammed up in it . " Damn them , Max thought . When you 're down , scraping through on ham hocks and beans , they do n't want to be bothered with you . But when they think you 've made it , they 're either afraid of you or put you down for being a Tom . What 's worse than being black ? Being black and lucky . Max took a final look around at his party , t hen slipped out . Harlem would n't come to him ; he would go to it . " Every time I see you up here , you 're runnin ' through . Them white folks run you out from downtown ? " Sergeant Jenkins . He seemed bigger , blacker , badder . Drugs were starting their poison/ous flow through Harlem and , rumor had it , Jenkins was hell on pushers and junkies . Max nodded briefly . Black sonofabitch , he thought . Like I do n't have any business up here . Like they were all waiting for me to leave Harlem for good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenks , " Max finally said , wearily . " Right now , " he lied , " I 'm doing a story on police brutality . Can you help ? " Jenkins grinned his big bad grin . " Police brutality , eh . What 's that , son ? I do n't know nothin ' about that . Sounds like Communist talk to me . You know the friendly , neighborhood cop is a public servant . That 's right , son . " " Yeah , sure . " " What happened to your ace-boon-coon , that other writer fella ? " " He 's in France . " " France , huh ? Hell , he married a white girl , did n't he ? What the hell 's he in France for ? Did he divorce her or something , or just ca n't get enough of that white nooky ? Is he coming back ? " " I do n't know . " Jenkins laughed . " You got your back up , son . Do n't shit me . I know your type . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nigger leaders , soon 's you get two quarters to rub together you got your ass on a ship for Europe . You do n't even know what 's going on here . " " We try , Jenks , we try . " " That Boatwright boy , he was an intellectual too , was n't he , son ? Look what happened to him . Look what he did . You cats is as queer as three dollar bills . If it ai n't sex , it 's in the fuckin ' head . I seen all kinds , son , and all the noise you make do n't help a junkie or a cat done messed over his wife good , one bit . Cats say I 'm hard . Sure , and I like to beat a bad nigger 's head . Know why ? Because when he sees me coming the next time he 's gon na get the hell outs my way . I 'm hard because I got to be . These niggers up here are harder on my ass than a hundred paddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got a family . Wife and kids . And I mean to come home in onop173piece when my day 's hitch is done . And every single day , every day , there 's some motherfucker up here sayin ' I ai n't gon na make it . What you damned intellectuals still got to learn is that this ai n't no classroom , son , it 's a jungle . " Jenkins hitched up his pants , those heavy dark blue pants with the flashlight in one pocket , .38 revolver low over one cheek of the ass , the row of cartridges , the blackjack and nightstick , the notebook , all attached . The paraphernaliamade a jangling noise . " Cool it , son . I got to go . Keep your nose clean . " Sweet Cheeks , the bartender at the Nearly All Inn greeted him as soon as he entered . " Here he is , ladies and gentlemen , the prodigal . The black Ernest Hemingway , Rudyard Kipling , Honore de Balzac all rolled into one . Furthermore , he is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winchell also all rolled into one . Hey , baby ! Where you been ? Have you come over to our side yet ? Gay is best , baby , I shit thee not . Have a taste ! " He fled as soon as he could to Big Ola Mae 's . He should have known what to expect from Sweet Cheeks ; his was the most vicious tongue in Harlem . He loud-talked you , if he did n't think his tip was large enough . Now , Max sat down and Ola Mae waddled over . " Maxwell ? It is you . Child , where you been ? Is you hungry ? You lookin ' a little bit peaked , there . I know , you done got married and your wife 's a little too fast for you . Right ? No . Well you eat somethin ' anyhow . Did you know your boss at the Democrat  --  " she bent close to Max , " that raggedy-assed nigger paper  --  married your girlfriend , that cute little thing , Mary . Sure enough did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all were then , softened by time and other women still . They spoiled a guy though , the women . Maybe it had to do with the male  --  female ratio he had heard about so much . He never thought about it the way he had thought of some European villages where whole male populations had gone off to war and been killed . What happened to the women ? They must have become ravenous . New York women were a very special breed . Just as most knowledgeable American women hesitate to compete with European women , so most American women pausep174before climbing into the same arena with New York women . Special . Tough , lovely , knowing , playing the cards the way they were dealt , most of the time . Maybe the war had done that , set women free . But Big Ola Mae was still leaning on the table , her fat , deep chocolate brown face benignly creased , motherly behind the out-ofplacegold-rimmed glasses , talking . " I bet you got one of them little white girls now , ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and every big nigger gets him a white girl . " She leaned back , brown flab encased in whalebone and elastic , laughed and slapped Max on the shoulder with a heavy hand . " I sure am sick of you colored men . Runnin ' just as fast as you can after them . Whoo ! Why do n't you menfolks wake up ? It ai n't nuthin ' , now , is it ? " She had killed his appetite . But he ordered coffee and sweet potatopie . When he finished , he left , walking home . At some point , going south on Broadway , past Juilliard , Barnard and Columbia , his pace slow with heavy thought , November 's cold slashing softly through the Heights , he decided that , with the first break , he 'd get out of it for a while . His piles were kicking up more . The Army operation seemed to have done no good . Nerves , one doctor told him ; too much sedentary work , another had said . He found himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to gather in his rectum . There was pain , but that seemed easy , compared to the rest . In successive days , Zutkin asked him to do some articles . ( All right , going-away money . ) Berg was getting him set to do a series on Jackie Robinson , how he spent his time off-season . Shea was giving him almost daily unsolicited reports on his burgeoningromance with Regina.  |p175Still  there was no mail from Harry . ( Well , if that 's the way he feels , later . ) Both doctors were agreed that what Max needed was another hemorrhoidectomy . What I need , Max told himself , is a little orgy . For Thanksgiving maybe . Mildred . After the long depression following Lillian 's death , there had come the women . He met them at parties , conferences , through intermediaries  --  in all the ways there are to meet women . He overdid his first affair , put too much into it , made it meaningful when he really had n't wanted to . He had to back out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had simply begun another , then another . One of his early girls ( Betsy ! ) had been very young , in her twenties , a graduate student at New York University . She wore T-shirts under her blouse ( " I sweat a lot . " ) . The way she liked to make love , it could be done with all her clothes on . She went for nothing else . That had been a mistake . A man likes to grab hold of more than just a head of hair . Most times . The ingenue he had met while writing theater copy liked to drink sherry . She had to have at least one entire bottle before she even thought about making love . Duringwhich time she whined about her career . Irene . The Swedish stringer at the UN , Frederika , was all right , except she never came . She liked jazz , but could n't shake her head to the music to save her life . There were a few tough hairs on her breasts that made lovemakingsomewhat uneasy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it felt like taking hold of a piece of warm chitlin . And she was forever shoving it up out of the way . Regina was another who never came except when she masturbated . She guessed that was why she could n't have an orgasm when lovemaking . Sometimesshe had seemed quite close . Her eyes would narrow , her movements grow short and choppy , as if she were nearing the crest of a hill , running . Then with a long , sorrowful gasp of resignation , she would quit . There was the model , Helene , who made love with quicksilver passion because she did n't have to , the way she had to with photographers , agents and others who made it possible forp176models to get to the top . A telephone call to a woman , or receiving one from a woman late at night , the work lying limp on the desk , meant one thing : the business of pursuing pleasure . Sometimes when one left his apartment and he was still keening his condition which was the murder of loneliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or she would come to him , giving him just time enough to change the sheets . Once when he had carried five changes of sheets to the laundry several times in a row , the laundryman asked , " Are you from the hotel down the street ? Tell me , because we can give you a discount . " Max left hastily , mumbling , No . Manhattan became a city filled with lonely women frowning at their telephones , anxious to make love , desperate to be with someone , and they would speed to him after a brief call , or he would dress hurriedly for the next day 's work , toothbrush and comb jammed into a pocket , and hail a cab to go speeding through a stroboscopic city to the Village , the East Side , Harlem , Chelsea . It was always the same during the first moments . A kiss , an embrace , small conversation , unwrapping the bottle , or , briefly , watching the Late Show , delaying deliciously that moment made possible by the New York Telephone Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes , darting unbidden into the night there would come a phone call . Max would sit or , if they were already in bed , lie and listen . He liked it when the phone was near the bed . There is no better way to learn a woman than to listen to her talking on the phone to her lover , husband , lover-to-be , while you are fondling her breasts and making a soft , flanking foray . How calm they were , the women . Like electricity , always there awaiting a finger to push the right button . Max marveled at it ; he accepted it . They were the winners , the women , and the man who thought not was the fool . Sometimes , high , Max would hold the woman he was with and let the words spill , cascade , knowing full well somewhere behind the drinks that this was not part of the deal , and whenever he was like that , he noticed in retrospect the next day  --  in the middle of an assignment having nothing whatsoever to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around her mouth . He would shrug , as if to her , and continue working . Then came Mildred . One night , soon after he began with the Century , he had some people to his apartment for drinks before going out to dinner . He did not really know his date ; he had only met her the week before . Mildred  --  he had glanced at her twice , pleasantly surprised that he would not be the only Negro in the dinner party . She came with a natty young man who said he was in television . During dinner Max 's date said she was coming down with a cold and Max sent her home in a cab . The signals had not been coming right , anyway . The party returned to his apartment where Max noticed Mildred ( and Charley , he thought ) in a corner . A few minutes later Charley ( ? ) rose and , making his words and attitude nonchalant , bid everyone good night . When the people who 'd brought Mildred and  --  was his name Charley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Mildred still sitting , they asked Max to see that she got home all right . Max put on a somber , responsible face as he assured them he would . When he had closed the door after them , he turned to Mildred . " Drink ? " " Yes , of course . " She was tall . She had " blow " hair , processed hair . Her eyes were a deep brown and her skin was the color of loam freshly turned in spring . She went to the kitchen with him and for lack of anything else to say ( Mildred sent and received signals ) , Max said , " Can I kiss you ? " She had been leaning on the refrigerator , fingers in her hair . " Sure , " she said , " if I can kiss you too . " He stroked her face after the kiss . Then they returned to the living room and played a record , " Night in Tunisia . " They drank in silence listening to it . ( That had been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stay . " In their situation the word had but one meaning . There was a whole list of words , a complete dictionary , for making love , or wanting to . " No , you come home with me , " she countered . He had notp178known then that Mildred was strict with herself about making love with her diaphragm ; that was why she left it at home . Conditioned . Determined . No one was knocking her up . Quickly , Max changed shirts , seized his toothbrush , and they left , arm in arm at three in the morning . There was a cat in her apartment and also many paintings of Greek male nudes . Mildred had put on Wozzeck while she made drinks . After , without a word , she pulled down the sheets on the bed and slipped into the bathroom . Max undressed slowly . God was good to him . Thank you , God , for seeing that I do n't go withoutwhen I need it . Thank you , Man . Mildred came slowly through the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her . She sat at the side of the bed . " In the morning , " she said , " we must be very quiet . Charley ? will be ringing downstairs . " Laughing softly she moved the telephone from the side of the bed and , unwinding the extension cord , took it to the outer room . " He 'll call if I do n't answer the door . I put the phone out there because if I do n't answer that he 'll kick the door in . I do n't want you to hear me lie to him . I may have to lie to you one day . " She had been confident that there would be more than one night . At the foot of the bed that night the cat had yawned , blinked and snuggled close to Max 's feet . " Daisy likes you , " Mildred said . " That 's a good sign . She does n't like just anybody . " Mildred was a poet and worked as a salesgirl at Lord &; Taylor 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chic , neat , appearing unviolated , unloved , and ready for more . Only her eyes were some what streaked with red . She wore a burnt orange coat and scarf ( Max remembered ) and had pleaded with Max not to forget to feed Daisy before he left . Please . There had been one bad moment between them . Mildred had slipped from the game . " Why do n't we get married ? " she asked one night after they had been seeing each other for several months . A good thing at an end , or was it ? Before he could answer she said , " I 'm sorry . It 's just tonight . It 's my birthday . I 'm twenty-nine years old . I want to be married and have children . This being tip179swinging chick and all is birdturd . Tonight , just now , it bothered me , this thing we have , Max . " Max grabbed the straw . " Why did n't you tell me it was your birthday ? We could have  --  " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties with great martinis and champagne at dinner . I do n't want anything special . Unless you 're it . " In the background was Wozzeck again ; it was her favorite record , that and Madame Butterfly . Mildred continued . " Lillian died and you 're not going to have anyone die on you again , not anyone you 're in love with , so you 're not going to fall in love , right ? " She knocked her ice cubes together in the glass and stared out over the rim at Max . " So I 'll give you a quarter for your two-bit analysis , okay , Mil ? " The climax of Wozzeck , the child 's scream , came between them . " I 'm sorry . I should n't have said that , " she said . " I 'm sorry too . " Yes , to hell with all of it except Mildred . Max borrowed Ricketts ' Coupe de Ville and Mildred brought a turkey just in case and even though , which meant , she translated as they rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that if he did n't get anything hunting , they 'd have the turkey . And if he did , it being Thanksgiving , they 'd still have it because she was n't going to clean and cook anything he might be lucky enough to shoot . He had n't told her that Ricketts ' cabin had food in the freezer and on the shelves and that Ricketts had called his caretaker and told him to get the house in shape for company . Ricketts used the place for relaxation and business too , the latter being meetings with precinct captains of New York 's Finest , and current bosses of the Cosa Nostra . In the mountains the skies became clear ; far-off stars and planets gleamed sharply in a sky lighted by cold moonlight . " This car is too much , " Mildred murmured about the Cadillac . Max grunted . He tried to match the tone of her voice to something she 'd said to him  --  " You 're too much , " or " It 's too much "  --  he forgot . Somethingas sensual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sleek and powerful , with points all over and long buttocksmoothlines . Think of America and you think of cars and Hollywood ; one in charge of the national debt , the other overseeing the national libido . They turned off the main road and onto a smaller one topped with macadam ; a dirt road followed , then an access road . Max pulled up before a low , wide cabin . White smoke curled slowly from the chimney and sought the stars . It looked cozy . " Here 's where we have our orgy , Mil . " She said nothing getting out of the car , but at the door she paused , pecked him on the lips and answered , " Yes , the first one in eight weeks . " He had not thought her words ominous then nor of the kiss as the kiss of farewell . The look she had given him after their first kiss , just inside the door , still clutching bags , also had no meaning . Then . He rose just before dawn , drank the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shells into the double-barreled shotgun and stepped out on the porch . He felt deliciously tired , sated . Mildredslept , curled softly on her side of the bed . Max pulled hard on his first cigarette then closed the gun with a dull , steely snap . Puttingthe safety on , he stepped to the ground and mashed the cigaretteunderfoot . He walked slowly down the road , now pushing the safety off ; he might catch a bird at the edge of the road . The gray mist of day was giving way to the lightening morning . Birds whickeredthrough the air , sparrows . A steady , biting wind snaked around the mountains and stalked stiffly up the road . Max pulled up his coat collar and blinked his eyes to clear them of the water brought to them by the wind . He thought he saw something down the road , a brown blur , a rough triangular shape . He hoisted the gun almost chest high and moved off the road , through a slight path ; he would come from the wood onto the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pheasant . He walked swiftly , tho dried twigs clutching at his clothing . He approached the road fast , crashing through the brush , his finger curled around the outside trigger . When he had gained the road he found nothing . He lowered the gun and stood motionless , watching the vapor of his breath rim )  |p181from  his mouth and evaporate . Bastard , he thought , and everybody felt sorry for the birds . I ought to marry Mildred , he thought , proceeding down the road . I ought to . He glanced about him . The sunshine was climbing through the mountain valleys now , laying down straight golden fingers , reflecting light from the brooding , dark-green acres of spruce and pine , warming the naked maples , teasing the great , twisted oaks . Come out , come out wherever you are . . . Max thought . She was all for him , Mildred . Whatever he did was all right , whenever he wanted to . That was important to a man . She understood . The cliche again . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face to the sun and glinted against its brassy glare . Good , feels good . ThanksgivingDay . Alone in the woods . Fine babe waiting in bed . Nice . He had spent two hours more in the field , he remembered , and then , returning to the cabin through the brush , just beneath him , suddenly , twisting and running like the head of a gigantic serpent , the designs on its back like those on a reptile , the hen burst cover with a dangerous sound of her wings . Max , still recoiling from the snake image , hesitated a moment , but then as the pheasant fled through a break in the brush and flew up against a small patch of open sky , Max fired , and before the echo of the first shot caught the hillsides , he let loose the other , tracking the bird down its sudden plummet to the ground , and he heard the pellets hit  --  thrrepp !  --  and saw feathers burst clear in the sky . The bird 's falling was now straight down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He broke open the gun and plucked the shells from the hot , smoking barrels . He lit a cigarette , then stood dry-plucking the hen . When that was finished , he took out his skinning knife and cut its throat to let the blood drain . Then , slipping the point of his knife just beneath the breastbone , he sliced open the stomach and shook out the contents . He 'd give the bird to Ricketts , a thank-you gift . Mildred was waiting for him , backing away from the pheasant . He laughed at her and went to get drinks while she fixed the turkey . There had been two days more of the orgy , but they would have others , he thought , driving back to the city . He really had thoughtp182that . But over coffee she had told him . Charley ( ? ) was back in the picture . Eight weeks between dates and no phone calls , what did Max expect ? And she knew Max well enough , she had said , to know that even if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ultimate in the American affair , marriage , she did n't know ; he had demonstrated a fierce selfishness and it left nothing for her . Charley ( ? ) would marry her , give her all the things she 'd never even think about if she were Max 's wife . She 'd accept . That 's all there was to it ; she 'd made up her mind . She had not wanted to ruin the weekendby saying anything before now . It had been her turn to be selfish . And during this , Max sipped his coffee and thought foolishlyof the bird downstairs in the car . Then , blinking , he glanced around the room , at Daisy , the paintings of the Greek nudes , the shelf of records with Wozzeck and Madame Butterfly set apart , and knew he was going to miss Mildred . This was what the look and kiss in the cabin was all about ; this was what the complaint about the eight weeks was about . It was all about Goodbye , Max . He said the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stroked her behind . She walked him to the door . And closed it softly behind him . He had not known what he felt then . His tongue had lain silently in his mouth , a little dry perhaps , but it had not been stuck . He whistled tunelessly driving to Ricketts ' home . The Cadillac purred beneath him , prowling its way uptown . Who else had gone like that ? They all went differently . Some drifted , some fled , or he drifted or fled . It was all motion , these affairs , energy , and the ones he enjoyed most were those that took the least mental toll . Goodbye , Mildred . Do you ever laugh when you call out , " Charley " ? Or was it Charley ? A soft rain was falling , months later . He was walking with Kermit Shea to Shea 's midtown apartment . They had had dinner and Shea had drunk a lot and become glum . The wet streets reflected store lights and the headlights of the slowly moving traffic . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light top183change . When it did , it caught a small , white sports car . Laughter trickled out of the car and Max , standing on the curb , just about to step down and proceed across the street , looked down into the car and saw Mildred , a filmy kerchief bound to her head , her white teeth flashing in the darkness , the whites of her eyes rolling up and widening . For just a moment . Max nodded and his mouth formed up to a smile and he stepped down , passed in front of the car and gained the opposite curb . A few paces down the walk he heard the traffic move , heard the sharp deep roar of the sports car , then he turned around . Old Mildred . Go , baby . " How 's Regina ? " Max asked . He could ask that now . Max and Shea had already gone through a scene when Shea , laughing of course , had wanted to know how Max had come to know her and Max lied because he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to be involved with Regina , to even be in love with her . " She 's all right , " Shea said quietly , handing out drinks . But when he sat down , he said , " Max , I have n't seen her in a while . " Regina 's pulled her number on him , Max thought . That Christmasbit . " Oh , " Max said . " I did n't know . I have n't spoken to her . " Max stared into his drink . When he looked up , he saw Shea dabbingat his eyes . Was the bastard crying ? " Well , " Max said , cheerfully , " you 're holding up all right ? " Shea nodded , gulped his drink and poured another . He took out his handkerchief and blew onto it . " I was having some problems , " he said . Max nodded . Do n't go on , man . I do n't want to hear it . Yet he knew that was precisely why Shea had asked him to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could n't , I could n't  --  " and Shea 's voice rose in muted anguish above the sound of the steadily falling rain . " Goddamnit ! " he said , stomping his foot on the rug . " I could n't get it up , Max . We 'd be there and , I 'll be a sonofabitch , I 'd want to so much it was killing me , and I could n't get it up until I told her I could n't get it up and then it was all right . For months , it was the same , and with every girl I 've ever known . Once I tellp184them , it 's all right , but it 's like I have to tell them every time I see them . " Max looked at the floor . Goddamn . He 's going to hate me tomorrow . Maybe he hates me now . It wo n't ever be the same . There 'll be nothing at Pace now . No man should make a revelation like that to another man , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were trying too hard , " Max said . " That can be murder . Too much hooch is bad , too . " " It was n't either one , " Shea said sadly . " I just could n't get it up . " Max thought , Did n't he have anyone else to tell this to ? Is he so bankrupt of friends that I 'm his best friend ? Maybe because he knows I do n't move in his circle ; I 'm certainly not going to tell his friends , because I do n't know them . He did not look at Shea . He thought of Mildred , her laughter , the white sports car . What had she thought the instant her eyes widened in recognition ? Gone now , tearing through the middle of Manhattan . She had been sitting on the rider 's side . Who was the driver ? " You ever had any trouble like that ? " Shea asked . Kill him , Max thought , kill ' im . Tell him never , not once in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should he decline the role of God or accept it ? Shea worked hard to be honest and to do that you had to ask shallow questions , not questions at all , but make statements about yourself . If he suspected that Max and Reginahad been lovers and Max had not had the problem getting it up , then Shea was going to hate him not only for hearing the confession but for having a harder cock . Harder and up longer . " Does n't everybody ? " Max said , tossing down his drink . " Really ? " " Come on . You know it . " Shea brightened a bit . " I thought that might be the case . . . ah , Max , I 'm screwed up and you know it and I know it . " Max shrugged . He felt bone weary now . Something very old wan starting all over again . After the operation he was staying out ofp185complications , and he was n't going to make any . Jesus , two operationson a man 's ass . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're going to be all right . Talk to a headshrinker , maybe . But I 'll lay ten to one that you 're going to wind up with one of the stiffest pricks in the city , maybe the whole Eastern seaboard . You wo n't be able to get enough pussy ; your reputation will spread from here south to Washington and from here north to Boston . You are going to wear chicks out . You are going to tear trim up . When you walk down Madison Avenue , the guys in the Look Building are going to say , " There 's goes a cocksman 's cocksman ! " The series on Jackie Robinson completed , Zutkin 's articles finished , Max checked into the hospital so he could be out in time for Christmas , give in to the season , the celebration of the impossible occasion , the rich man 's chance to dissipate the image of Scrooge ; celebrate the lie and in consequence celebrate the massacre of the babes ( while one escaped , that one  --  with his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride to Antipater  --  victim of his father 's wrath for striving for his father 's throne through Herodian power and the Hebrew law of succession through Mother ; and Josephand an ass .

Yes , all of that , but he wanted to be home for Christmas . In the hospital , smelling of wax and starched sheets and rubbing alcohol , they took his temperature , pulse and blood pressure . Up from the lab a cutie with pipette and tube for the complete blood count . The intern asked him questions in his most bored bedside manner . They did not feed him . The next day they gave him pills and shaved his buttocks . And after , through the swinging door , they rolled a stretcher . For him . Then he was on an elevator filled with sweet-smelling nurses , young , and even the starched rustle of their uniforms made them somehow more alluring . The whiteness , the purity of white did it . It made him want to scatter some dirty old semen all over it , the whiteness , make it more human . OR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not going to die from shock or some jerk 's stupidity , he told himself . Gently they held his arm , pushed the needle into the big vein and slipped in the sodium pentothal . Max went over the precipice . He was depressed . People whittling gleefully away at your flesh . Did they flush it away to join the shit and cloudy condoms floating in the rivers ? Did fish nibble at it , a delicacy ? Look , man , here 's a piece of Max Reddick ! Have a taste ! Just what did they do with the flesh ? It was a little bit of dying , already , faster . Even with their clean sheets , drugs , voluptuous nurses , flowers , diets , stainless steel tools , you were dying . But you knew that  --  piece of flesh , massed calcium , hunk of gristle , haphazard bit of matter , product of warm , ancient seas , still steaming lands wracked by unimaginable diastruphisms ; the dark , dark memories of that time ( and the puzzle  - -  reptile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever ? ? ? ? ) contained where , in the blood , the very atoms of the bone ?

I Am , I told you , damn it , I Am . Fresh flowers surrounded him and their scent filled the room . Granville Bryant , sitting in a chair , smiled at him . Beside him was another boy , a very pretty one , with violet eyes and flaxen hair and the tan of a youth always in the sun . Granville said , " Well now , Max , how are you feeling ? " Max nodded his head slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? You ca n't avoid lunches or slip away from parties , can you , Max ? " " Cigarette , " Max said . Bryant made a slight , almost unseen gesture and the youth glided forward , a glittering , golden cigarette case opening in his hand . In the other there appeared , magically , a lighter . After Max had taken a pull on the cigarette , Bryant said , " They tell me that 's just like having a baby . " He laughed softly and smiled at his boy . " Never had one of those . One of my friends did though . He was very careful after that . Sailors and writers  --  oh , they can be so sadistic ! " Bryant crossed a leg  --  elegantly  --  and leaned back as if preparing to tell Max something important . Or a story . Once upon a time , and it seemed to Max that just recently he had been having silly dialogues with someone , an object was seen hurtling down from an Eastern sky . When the nearest townspeople arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have containedpeople , but no one was in it . First , it was thought that Buddhahad cast sinners from the heavens and the sinners had evaporatedin transit . Many , many years later , centuries , it was thought that the object was a part of the original Black Stone hidden awayp189by the evil Qarmata in the Far East . Then the object was forgotten altogether ; it was covered by swells of the earth , the dirt and rock . The truth , however , was that the object was a craft from another planet and the creatures in it , who looked very much like humans , their planet having the same makeup as ours , were stranded here . Looking very much like humans , they mixed with the populace withoutattracting attention to themselves . Being of superior natures , they soon mastered the skills of the earthmen , then went on to become their betters . These were men who did not know women . By our standards the first group were extraordinarily handsome . On their planet females were used only to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order to appear as genuineearthmen , they came to know earthwomen , and their handsomenesswas altered in their offspring , some of which were like them and some just like other earthmen . They traveled across the earth and across the five seas , the succeeding generations of these men from space , and in due course they became stevedores and bankers , philosophers and hoodlums , musicians and clerks , writers and actors , unskilled laborers and atomic scientists ; they became soldiers and sailors , warriors and generals . They were of all conditions , high , low and in between , and they were all colors ; no discriminationexisted between them . They could tell their own from an arch of the brow , a vocal inflection , a bend of the wrist , the pelvic walk . Slowly , over the centuries , they came to control many of man 's efforts on earth , but they did it secretly . They were laughed at , hated , legislated against , harrassed , made vulnerable , all of which made them band together more quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth people to rationalize them as persons with an inherently ill nature ; earth men traced that naturethrough legend , literature , art , business and rumor . During this time , the most brilliant made their way into the offices of ministers , kings and presidents with the purpose of serving whatever nation they found themselves in loyally and to the full . Some were found out and dismissed . Others continued on , trying to improve the earth . Slowly , ever so slowly , with the power well within theirp190grasp , they will improve the earth . Women will be defeminized by them , made nude , and the mystery of their bodies will exist no more . Or , if they are clothed , their breasts will be flattened , their hips squared , their mouths and hair painted in outlandish colors . They will , these men from out there and their descendants , design men 's clothes , make them more feminine . There will be no other styles available . They will continue to work with the languages . In polite company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " queer , " " faggot , " " fruit , " " queen "  --  they will say homosexual or nothing at all and they will make works by homosexuals more and more acceptable . They will seek in the legislatures of the world surcease from police and other social harrassment . However , with all these things against them , they have taken on the burdens of the races of which they are now a part . There are small problems : some who do not belong try to in the most ostentatious fashion . And some who do are always fighting it . Max , I know that secretly I am called the Great White Father because I help young Negro writers get started . I did not help you , Max , so you have no cause to be grateful to me on that score . I do n't even want your gratitude for the job ; you deservedit . I have told you our story . Be tolerant . We too are outcasts . We have a natural empathy for your people . How well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ! Max was thinking . He saw that the chair beside his bed was empty . Where the hell is he ? Where 's that kid ? That cigarette ! Max floundered in bed looking for it , until he thought to look in the ashtray . There was one cigarette butt in it . Max rang for the nurse . " Yes , Mr. Reddick ? " Her voice came out through a loudspeaker . " What time did Mr. Bryant leave ? " " Mr. Bryant ? There was no Mr. Bryant here to  --  " " An old man and a young fellow . " " There was a Mr. Wilkinson here . " There was a Mr. Wilkinson here . There was a Mr. Wilkinson here.  |p191The  voice was no longer female , nor was it really male either . A voice without body . The words spiraled down Max 's consciousness and he remembered that as a child he had had to make spirals between the two blue ruled lines on his paper during the penmanshiplessons ; the white circles where he started and ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Max 's eyes shot open in fear and his heart raced like a slipped clutch of a car . He remembered the words , the last line of the last of a series of crazy dreams , dreams which slipped with envious ease back and forth in time : There was a Mr. Wilkinson here . Max stared at the beams in the ceiling of Michelle 's house in Leiden . Why ever in the hell was his heart racing because of a dream about Roger ? Did it know something ? Was it recalling the pieces ? Was it blackjack now ? Gin ? Where else had he been ? At the table in Paris where Max , Harry and a few others had had their morning coffees , listening mostly to Harry talk against the roar of traffic rushing down Boulevard Raspail . Roger again , saying that he had gone to one of those Catholic colleges that specializes in prelaw courses and which was always being visited by people from the FBI and the CIA to recruit personnel from among the student body . ( " Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There had been laughter , stomach-bursting laughter . Talk to a clown like Roger ? Desperate , those CIA cats ; had to be desperate . Max saw images of Roger : Paris , laughing over coffee , talking his French jam up , beret hung down over one eye . Roger in Rome : standing on the Via Veneto talking Italian to the Italian hippies with their shades , thick heels and eight inches of shirt collar open at the neck . Roger : sauntering , down Leidsestraat shouting hip phrases in Dutch to the Dutch hippies cooling past in shades with sticks of pot in their mouths . Roger everywhere . Smiling , laughing loudly , mimicking . Roger : enough to crack your ribs with laughter . Clown . But why , Max wondered , am I thinking of him now ? Guilt , maybe . Bad scene last night with that check . Very bad . The only other time he had been sharp with Roger was when he was stalking Regina ; Regina now married , kids , their friendship over because she knew as Maxp192knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not lose sleep if their wives took from the attic a sambo toy from the past . It was , as far as Max knew , a good marriage . After Shea , Regina had floundered a little through the spring , giving off strong scents of her weakness , which was to be loved , wanted , forgiven for surviving , and Roger , like a dog sniffing the crotch of a woman during her menses , was there . There had been something wrong with it  --  what , exactly , Max had n't known  --  but he made it clear to Roger that he was to stay away from her . Roger had smiled , of course , wisely , Like , okay , man , the smile seemed to have said , I dig she 's yours no matter how much you say she 's not . If she 's yours , well , boss . You the best , baby . After that summer , in a way , maybe she had been his , but not in the way Roger meant . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Max felt himself relaxing when he thought of Regina , and going back to that summer . . . " . . . and get the hell out of Korea , " Arthur Godfrey had said . His radio audience had applauded . Had it been hotter than usual that summer , Max wondered , or had it just been Korea ? He had had the postoperative itch bad and the heat had sent him running back to the doctor for a soothing massage and a careful look-see . He had climbed on the table , lowered his chest and raised his rear , waiting for the rubber-coated finger . The doctor had been good ; his single failing was that he liked to listen to Arthur Godfrey . But Max had depended on the doctor 's finger , the expert massage it gave , the immediate relief from inner torment . " Steady , " the doctor always said . " Relax . Make like you 're making a stool . " Max went to an air-conditioned movie when he left the doctor 's office . The movie would cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper a little more bearable . The movie was about Paris , and some wrinkled little old guy with the hots for a skinny little librarian . In a way the movie was about incest too . These old guys , Max thought , loving it up , taking on generation after generation ofp193broads . Gable , Grant , Cooper and the rest . What the hell was going on ? There was a new crop coming up : " The Toothies , " the film critic on the Century called them , and many were Jewish guys who had changed their names . More freedom to be any kind of racial member now , yes , but , Jeez , Mac , do n't bring me the Abie Finklesteinbit , okay , baby ? Soon " The Toothies " would be the old guys , and they 'd take on the chippies for another three generations . No wonder everyone was so screwed up . But Paris was some place . It made Max think of Harry . New York had n't been the same since he had left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Jaja Enzkwu , then to China , then back to Africa . He was resting in Paris now , awaiting the publicationof his collection of articles on Franco Spain , two of which Max had read . It seemed that Harry was spreading out , taking on the world instead of just white America . Oppression was oppression , Max and Harry had once agreed , and there was a relationship between the oppressed Negroes of America , the oppressed Spaniards , the oppressed brown peoples of Asia and the oppressed black peoplesof Africa . But Harry 's books , which did not deal specifically in fiction or nonfiction form with Negroes , were not well received in the United States . Yet , old Harry had been around the world and was now telling of the Spanish mystique , the extent of police power , the lack of religious freedom , the toppling of the Spanish people from the peak of pride down into doltish stupidity . The Republic had been their last chance and they had blown it . Now there was little else except to trap as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , as corrupt as the next caballero . Going back to the office , Max decided that he would write to Harry that afternoon . Enough , this being salty over what white folks said . Harry should have been bigger than that . Max walked into the office and pulled off his jacket . The windows were open and the heavy smell of the river came in . He sat down and loosened his tie and rolled up his sleeves . In the aisle behind him the copy boys and reporters brushed past with coffee and sandwiches . " Hey , Max , " some of them said , " going to Korea ? " They had asked withp194laughter and Max laughed back . Then he sat down to write to Harry . It was no secret that Berg desperately wanted Max to go to Korea and see Harry Truman 's integrated Armed Forces take the field against the North Koreans . Berg had broached the idea in a roundabout way and Max had beat a rapid retreat . The joke in the office was , who in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly die for the Century ? That was the way the white reporters put it in their discussions . Max could see a white reporter doing it , but not himself . It made no difference that Berg had said he could see a Pulitzer for Max ; that the Negro fighting man for the first time in American journalism would be given credit at the moment he deserved it ; Berg could see that too . But , Max thought , he could see Berg being beside himself with joy if circulation tripled in Harlem , Bedford Stuyvesant and Astoria as a result of the articles . Max used his operation as an out , but he knew that if the pot bubbledover in Korea , he 'd have to tell Berg , no . Max assumed he would not have to do that . Berg had sense enough to know that any Negro really aware of his position in American society in the year 1950 , if given the chance to refuse to go to a real fighting war and still remain economically and socially solvent , would refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cynical liberal ( his own words ) . Besides , when the white Americans called out , " Gook ! " it sounded awfully like nigger . Max had heard about that kind of war in the Pacific ; he wanted none of it . But there was no reason why Korea would not turn into that kind of racial war . Instead of the British and French kicking the Orientals in the ass , now it was steady Uncle Sam . Ultimately there would be China to face . Racial wars called something else . The Russians understood the hell out of that . They carried the blood of the Khans and the Timurids . Thus tinged they were the least white of all the major Allies in War II  --  and suffered most . Could they forget Stalingrad , for example , where they lost more men than were lost by the Americans throughout the entire war ? And the Japanese . If ever there came a chance to kick Sam 's ass , they would n't pass it up . Sure , they werep195coming along fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could forget Little Boy peeled down the sky upon Hiroshimaand Nagasaki ? Military humiliations could be forgiven under a military code , but racial humiliations dealt under a military code never could be forgiven . Crazy , these wars . But there remained something haunting and curious about the chance to go to a war in which you yourself did not have to carry a gun or suffer in the foxholes ; a war in which you were not the primary target counting off with every fearful stride the seven secondsit takes the enemy to get you in his sights and kill you . Given the chance , most men preferred war that way . It was true that correspondentswere killed during wars , but those often were the ones who forgot , after all , that wars were only current news , that they were simply reporting the extensions of national policies foisted upon the shoulders of a poor pfc eating regularly for the first time in his life , or a second looey trying to wrest command from his sergeant . War II was n't quite five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the poor , stupid , losing French . Now they were in Vietnam , and losing their shirts . And Israel , surrounded by Arabs and the Mediterranean . How long would that last ? The thought of Israel made him think of Bob Loewenstein ; he had interviewed Bob the day before for a " Portrait " because he was donating the proceeds from his current show to Israel . There were some loose ends Max had to tie up . He ripped the letter to Harry from the typewriter , reread it and put it into an envelope which he addressed by hand . Wars , he thought , as he picked up the phone to call Bob , I want no part of wars . How can one write intelligently of an act that is basically stupid ? Somebody would ; lots of somebodies would , but I 'm not going to be one of them . Then , he had believed that . Max glanced over his notes as he dialed . Bob was doing great . Making all the money and still had his art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Regina , but Max knew that he ( Max ) was n't supposed to know about her . The meeting aboard the ship when Harry and Charlotte were leaving had been byp196chance , Bob would have him believe . Max had n't mentioned Regina either , of course . After , he had marveled at how easily one passes through the cuckoldry circus of Manhattan . If you choose to becomeinvolved in the games , you must honor the rules . Bob had had a hacking cough yesterday and had taken many cough drops along with a few martinis to ease a sore throat , but nothing seemed to help . When Bob got on the line Max would inquire about his cold , of course . " Hello . " Letitia , Max thought , Bob 's wife . The voice sounded hollow , as if she were speaking in a great cathedral to no one in particular . " Max Reddick , " Max said , " How are you , Mrs. Loewenstein ? " He 'd never met her . He went on . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is he there or at the gallery ? " " Mr. Reddick ? From the Century ? Yes he told me . Mr. Reddick , Bob 's in the hospital . " Her voice now sounded very small and very hurt . " What 's happened ? " There was a pause , then she said , " He came home late last night , went to sleep , but did n't wake up this morning . He was in a coma . He 's still in a coma . " " What hospital ? " She gave him the name of the hospital , but added , " You ca n't see him . Just the family . " " Can I call you to find out what 's going on ? " " Yes , yes , of course , Mr. Reddick . " " Do they know what it is ? " " They think it 's an aneurysm . " " Oh , Jesus . " " I 've got to go now . " " Yeah , sure . I 'll call later . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Portraits " editor . " Loewenstein is in the hospital with an aneurysm . Coma . Want to switch it to city desk ? "  | " No . Not a big enough name . If he dies we 'll run the portrait with the copy we have . Hold it for now . " Max hung up . Should he call Regina or let her find out ? If Bob had seen her , he probably told her about the " Portrait " and she would have asked which reporter on the Century was doing it . Max called her . She sounded very cheerful , having just come in from work and having seen Bob the night before , she told Max . And he thought , Oh , God . He imagined Regina , calmed and sated , perhaps combing her hair while she talked . Then he thought of Bob , lean and spare , as still as the death he was moving toward under an oxygen tent . For Regina , it had always been Bob , even when she was seeing him , Shea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the head that looked sort of squeezed in from the sides , the thin broken nose , the sandy hair . Bob with the hip phrases . " Yass , baby , how you doin ' ? " " How 's Bob 's portrait going ? " Regina asked , slyly . Max had guessed right . " Baby , I got to talk to you , " he blurted . " Can I come over ? " " Baby , I got to talk to you , ' " she mocked him . " What 's the matter , horny ? " " Naw , hell no , " Max said , suddenly wishing he were and that was all he had to see her about . Suddenly the cheerfulness was gone and in its place was a urgency . " What is it , Max ? " " I 'll tell you when I see you . " " No ! What is it ? " Regina 's voice was instantly demanding , startlinglyharsh , as if some instinct had signaled her that a diaster had occurred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Goddamn it , you 're not going to see me , Max ! Now what is it ? Is it about Bob ? " Max was stung . " Later , Regina . " She crashed on , " What 's happened ? Where 's Bob ? What 's this all about ? Max , tell me ! " Her voice was now a scream so loud that Max moved the phone away from his ear.  | " Bob 's in the hospital . In a coma , honey  --  " " Aw , no ! " " Reg  --  " " When ? " " Reg  --  " " When ? Where ? " " Reg , it was sudden . His wife could n't wake him this morning . She called the doctor and they took him to the hospital . He 's been there ever since . He 'll be all right . " " He 's not ! He 's going to die ! " Then Max saw it . She wanted him to die for the torment he had caused her , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was dying . " He was with me last night , " Regina said . " We made love ! He had a sore throat . . . " She wanted him to die and now he was dying . She had put that pussy on him and it killed him , finally . That weapon they have , the women . There was nothing else to do at the paper . Max left Regina 's number at the desk and took a taxi to her house . Regina cried at his side while he called the hospital and got a report . " Condition serious . " Well , it was n't critical yet , Max thought . But they lied to you . Nobody 's going to lie to me when my time comes , if I know it 's coming . Now that I know , Max thought to himself in Leiden , I try lying to myself . He held Regina in this arms . It was kind of stupid , that , but it was Man perhaps a million and three quarters of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they cried . Some people laughed and danced to keep from crying . Max remembered some of the wakes he had gone to as a very young man , when everyone came in with cake or potato salad or hams or fried chicken , barbecued spare ribs or cole slaw or macaroni salad , and whiskey . Then came the music and the slow drags and the Lindy Hops , the boogie woogies . The older people , they 'd sing ,  | " Did n't He Ramble , " but maybe in the next room that corpse was n't going to ramble anymore . " It just ca n't be ! " Regina kept saying . Her love for Bob should have kept him strong and incapable of dying ? Regina , he thought , we should be wise now . This is a time for setting precedents , you and I. We should be making love , stone screwing and drinking and playing records and screwing some more , and eating ; it is a time for letting those who are going to die , die . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must pause to mourn , reflect on dying . Except in war . Then you want to get away fast from the place where the dying is done . " No , no , no . " Regina sobbed , smashing her foot against the floor . Mad at God , Max thought . Mad at Jews who get themselves gassed and mad at the ones who escaped . Mad at Bob for not wanting her badly enough to throw out his wife and four kids , and now mad at him because he is dying and she had told him to his face ( she was saying now , mucus and tears strewn through her hair ) that she wished he were dead . Max led her to the bathroom and washed her face , dug the cloth into those deep , grief-carved creases that had suddenly lined her face . He opened her medicine cabinet and asked what pills she wanted to take . She gestured toward the bluecapsuledsodium amytal . " How many do you usually take ? " " Two , " she said in her shattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her room while she undressed in the bathroom and readied for bed . Once he had known what it felt like to lie in her bed , to pad barefoot from the bathroom to the kitchen to put up coffee or to make a sandwich . She came out of the bathroom , her face bare of makeup , as if she had gone into mourning . She got into bed and let Max pull the covers up . " Call me if you need to , " Max said . " Thanks . Thank you , Max , " she said drowsily . He closed the door to the apartment and heard the lock snap behind him . He hoped she would n't call in the middle of the night , but who else was she going to call ? Could she say she was crying over a guy who wasp200dying when he left her in bed ? Could she tell anyone who the guy was ? No . She would have to go back to the beginning , the way she had with Max . That would mean telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , met her in the Catskills where they fished in a small lake at night and Bob tried to imitate the whippoorwill 's cry , or met her in the little hotel in Taxco where , with the sun setting , all the mountains of Mexico , harsh and grim during the day , turned soft , and the vultures on their last flights through the valleys had not seemed repulsive at all ? Could she tell about meetings and bag lunches and long , arm-in-arm walks along the promenadeof Carl Schurz Park ? Could she tell of begging Bob to impregnateher and how , untrusting of her then , he had not seen her for three months ? What Max had n't heard before , he heard that night and there had been so many times when , in genuine anger , he wanted to ask : Why , why , do you hurt yourself so ? But he knew the answer and that made the question invalid . He called her the next morning , then called the hospital for another report . Condition : " Serious . " Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retard furtherdamage to the brain . The sore throat he had complained of had been a broken vessel in his head , spurting a steady stream of blood against the back of his throat . Max reported to Regina , then dressed and took a taxi to her apartment and made her eat . The tears had not stopped and she had not slept . Twenty-four hours ago , Max thought , she had been her usual lovely self . Today , she looks ugly and a thousand years old . Could I have ever broken my neck to get into bed with this ? Regina wanted to go to the hospital and Max became angry . " Do n't be a stupid broad all your life , Reg . What about his wife and kids ? His sisters and brothers and his parents ? What have you to do with any of that ? All they need right now is you running in there screaming all over the place . " The tears , the body-shaking sobs , the forlorn body , sexless now , the gray eyes transformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like damp , stained straw . Max , watching her , thought , Those rottenp201little truths . He could almost hear them strike her , see her body recoil from them . He reached across to her and held her . " I 'm sorry , " he said at last , thinking , World , look at this tableau . Look , world . We suckle your babies , clean your kitchens and shithouses , gave you all the blackertheberry your men ever wanted , take all the jobs you do n't want , fight in your wars and now you want us to stop short of loving and consoling your women too ? " Try to call your office , Reg . Come on , now . When this is all over you wo n't want to have lost your job . If it happens bad  --  " He paused . But some preparation was necessary . "  --  the job 'll be good to have . You 'll appreciate having something to do , some place to go . " He listened while she talked on the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to go ? " " Yes . " She started crying again , then silently , mouth pursed into a pout , until the scream burst from her trembling , tightened lips . " Oh , Max , what in the hell am I going to do ? " Max remembered the endlessly long days after Lillian 's death ; he remembered watching the sun come up and its light fill the room in which he slept , and he remembered the way it had eased down at the end of the day when the radios and voices , the slamming doors of the other apartments , jarred his being , made him think for the first time of the living . How had the fat couple on the second floor made love to each other ? Was the tall , skinny , light-skinned woman on the first floor a good lover ? Why did the guy beneath him laugh so much and so loudly ? Much of the emptiness had remained , sometimes it hurt , at other times it merely ached . Remembering , Max took Regina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His own eyes began to water and he held her tightly to him so that she might not spring free before he had a chance to blink the tears away . He left soon afterward and went wearily to the Century office where he spent the balance of the day plodding through work . He paused only to call the hospital and to call Regina , who now demanded that Max call Bob 's doctor and get an up-to-date progno/sis . Max did not pass that along to Regina . The doctor did not hold out any hope whatsoever for Bob 's recovery . Just as well , Max thought . The brain 's going to jelly now , or parts of it . Better off dead . When Max was about to leave the office in the early evening , he called Regina to tell her to dress so they could go out and eat . He called the hospital once again . Now it was , " Condition critical . " Max rang Regina 's doorbell and heard her inside running to open the door . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max pushed her inside . " No , he 's not . I just called the hospital before I left the office . His condition 's critical , but he 's still alive . " " No , goddamn it , no . He is dead , I tell you , dead , dead , dead ! " It was no good trying to reason with her . Max called the hospital and asked for Bob 's doctor again . He hung up slowly . Puzzled , he said aloud , " Why would they say critical ' when he 's already dead ? " Reg must have felt it and called . Max took her arm . " C'm on , we 're going to get something to eat . " " I do n't want to eat ! " She tore away from him . Max sighed . " Reg , I 'm very tired and you look pretty bad . Let 's eat ; this 'll all wear a little better . After all , what can you do now ? " She wiped her eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll try to be good , honest . But it 's so hard . . . " The tears again , then down the elevator , the hot night greeting them as they stepped into the street . She held him tightly as if she might lose him . She staggeredagainst him sometimes and he would mutter , " Straighten up , baby , straighten up , Reg . That 's better . " He did not remember where they ate , but he remembered the walk back to her home . She held him tightly , as before , and bumped against him again . Her face chased grief and anger , anger and grief . Max heard her grinding her teeth ; he caught the saw'steethsound of the sobs she could not suppress , but she did not give way altogether until they were in the elevator . Upstairs he placed her on her bed and called her doctor , as she had asked . He handed her the phone and listened to her talking . She was asking the doctor to call the place where she usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , Max ? I know you 're tired , but I would appreciate it ifp203you just dropped me off at the little hospital . I feel so tired , I 'd be afraid to try , myself . " " Sure , " Max said . He got down a bag for her and watched her comb her hair and put makeup on . Looking in the mirror she said , " Shea . He was the only person I ever met who was weaker than me , and I was happy . I could see Bob , fading into just a memory . I could have helped Shea  --  Kermit , but he broke it off . Did n't want to be weaker than me . He could have helped me too , because I need to be able to help someone , not always be helped . That 's important  --  " She glanced at him in the mirror and spun around . " Oh , Max ! Do n't look so sad . " She kissed him on the cheek . " Do you know something ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , Max , I just feel tired , not dirty at all , just so tired I could sleep for a thousand years . " She drew back as if a thought had just occurred to her . " Before we go , should we make love , just once more , to say goodbye to the old Regina ? I really feel something else , Max . I mean it . Would you ? " And Max looked at her carefully . No hysteria , no blankness . An earnestness , an innocence even . " I am very tired , baby . " " Yes . I 'm sorry . Not about the offer , but because I made you tired . Max ? " " Yeah ? " " I do n't really know anyone else who would have done for me what you 've done . " " Forget it . " At the small , East Side hospital , Max walked her to the door , carrying her bag . He rang the bell and a nurse answered . " Hello , Regina . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform . " Hello , Collins , " Regina answered . " In for the last time , sweetie , so do n't fuss over me . " Max kissed her on the cheek , then on the mouth and returned to the waiting taxi . The door to the little hospitalclosed with a barn !  |p204BAM  ! MAX jumped in the bed , his mouth agape , his hands held protectively in front of him . Slowly , the bedroom in Leiden came back into focus . Max lowered his hands . What in the hell is scaring me besides the cancer ? That I know about . It 's something I do n't know . He looked at the floor where Harry 's briefcase had fallen and its brass fittings had clattered on the oaken floor . " Max ! Max ! " He heard Michelle racing up the steps . She burst through the door , her eyes sweeping the room in fright . " Are you all right ? I heard something fall . " Max pointed to the briefcase . She said , " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers yet ? " " No , I 've been drowsing. 1 ' 11 get to them in a minute . " " If you need me , " Michelle said , " just call . " There was something in her eyes Max saw , something familiar , knowing , like Mildred'seyes had been when she knew she was going to leave him . Like Regina 's eyes when she knew even their friendship was over . " Max , " Michelle said . She had been about to close the door . " Yes . " She simply stared at him , pityingly . " Yes , " he repeated . " It is nothing . " She closed the door gently , almost reverently , as if someone were dead in the room . She knows , Max thought . She 's thought about the smell . Max retrieved the briefcase from the floor and unlocked it . He took out a yellowing envelope addressed to Harry in Paris . He took the letter from the envelope and scanned it , then paused at the signature . Theodore Dallas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. Mission to the United Nations . A blond Negro with blue eyes , a Democrat who managed to secure some important positions . The letter was dated two years ago . Max readp205and reread the letter . It seemed friendly . He set the letter aside , then removed the contents from the case and saw that the packets were numbered . He removed the packet numbered " L. " In the distance he heard a train rushing toward the station he had passed trying to find Michelle 's house . Max placed a pillow beneath his buttocks to ease the throbbing pain and opened the packet . Dear Max : You are there , Max ? It is you reading this , right ? I mean , even dead , which I must be for you to have these papers and be alone in the company of Michelle , I 'd feel like a damned fool if someone else was readingthem . I hope these lines find you in good shape and with a full life behind you , because , chances are , now that you 've started reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby . Max blinked and reread the lines . What was this ? It was like listening to Harry talk once more , perhaps in Paris in the cafe , or in his house , in his study , with Charlotte and Little Max in the other room , and he , Max , tingling from feeling good , just being in Europe , and grateful that Zutkin had taken him to task for not writing novels . GRATEFUL , later , but resentful then . Max 's plans had been sketched out and the talk with Zutkin had stung enough so that he moved up his timetable . They had been lunching at the Algonquin  --  Zutkin liked the Algonquin  --  and Zutkin was being the old writing master , taking Max to task : " It 's spring , Max , 1953 , and you have n't published a book except those essays in over three years . They 'll forget you . Is the Century taking it all out of you ? Do n't squeeze your talent out on Berg 's paper . In another ten , fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because whatever transition comes willp206be because of them . Things are moving fast  --  " Zutkin raised his hand placatingly . " I know . A cliche , but that does n't mean it 's untrue . There is a task force of sociologists , psychologists , attorneys and educators , and people of good will  --  " that was the first time Max had ever heard the phrase , " People of good will "  --  " are working now on papers that will shake this nation from top to bottom . School segregation has an excellent chance of being outlawed by the Supreme Court . The speed of the change will tell us what kind of country we 're living in and about the people . No issue so reveals what people are or will do as this one of race . This is going to be an exciting and terrible place until that problem gets settled or , at least , people decide that it must be settled . Take your break now , Max , so you can be back when it all starts . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Europe to write . You 've made your peace with Harry . You made it in a very sly way ; you simply stopped writing books ; you stayed out of competition with him . We know what the critics do to Negro writers  --  hurl them into the pit and let them kill each other off  --  that 's going to change , too . " " Do n't hold your breath , " Max had said . He had glanced around the room . There was a female novelist he had met . She had a long , racehorse neck and was eating very daintily . At another table sat a male novelist with heavy brows who , it was said , drank a fifth and a half of bourbon every day and liked his women under nineteen years of age . Zutkin was right , of course , it was time to get out ; get out before you got used to the weekly paycheck , the travel , meeting the famous people ; get out before death and corruption , the seedy side of life , became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berg for a leave starting in the fall . " All this is none of my business , Max , " Zutkin said . Max smiled . But , Zutkin had noticed , it was a smile without mirth . " No , it is n't , " Max said . " But you 've got all the answers anyway , have n't you ? " Zutkin lowered his head as if expecting a charge . He had always done that , even as a child . People had thought that because he wasp207involved with books and writing he was a punk who could n't take care of himself . But Max had said nothing else and Zutkin had raised his head , noticing with some distress that Max now seemed bored by his presence . Strange , Zutkin thought , how for a time you think you know someone and then  --  you just do n't , not at all . A word , a look and there 's the end of something . " Except that you 're a good writer . I care . In a way I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had had his say and he had meant it ; Max could do with it as he liked . Max had changed . Maybe it had started with his girl 's death . One could not any longer call Max petit bourgeois . The change was good to see , but what did it por-tend ? Against the background of writer 's talk and the clattering of china and silver , Max felt momentary regret . It was hard , damned hard to dislike people who liked you . Here Zutkin was talking about great changes coming over the land , this great , vital Americanland and he did n't know shit about what great changes , at least , not American ones . Wise , yes , he was wise , but the wisest men looked stupid when it came to exercising that wisdom about America . What about now , right now , never mind the big picture . Max swung his head around the room . How foreign it seemed after small dark kitchens in the South where the meals had consisted of grits , grits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken or pork , and the people in those kitchens with their dark , impassive faces coming out of clothes that always smelled of cooking . The Algonquin dining room smelled good and the faces in it were so goddamned innocent , even those etched with some genteel kind of evil . God , these people do n't know , Max thought . Sure , he had avoided going to Korea , using his operation as an excuse . He had n't gone to witness and report on the military industryand how it was brought to bear upon and obliterate humanity . Instead , he seemed to have become the Century 's ace reporter on lynchings in the South and the subsequent trials for murder , if the murderers insisted on being apprehended . He had made many trips to the South , to the small , still belligerent towns in Mississippi , Al/abama , South Carolina  --  towns with their Civil War monuments surrounded by neat lawns of St. Augustine grass upon which sat old Negro men , as watchful as tomcats , wearing sweat-stained felt hats , wrinkled khaki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many courtrooms down there , in the colored gallery sections , of course , and smelled the sheepshitty , acrid odors and seen the Confederateflag stretched open behind the judges ' benches ; he had seen too many dead , mutilated Negroes and tough , alive , giggling crackers . There was your war ; there really was no other . Max had looked at the white defendants , at their relatives in both the jury box and audience , and had come to know , really know that to be oppressed was not enough to win ultimately ; that to be in the right was not enough . You had to win the way they had won  --  with blood . Words , petitions , laws , ideas , were not going to be enough . The common denominator was blood , white blood as much as black blood . The politicians he had met , the personalities , black and white , their publicized indignation , were as nothing . They made no waves . How could they , when Negroes themselves were a part of the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools , the minute grants of status within the segregated communities , the security derived therefrom . You talk about change , man ? You 'd better talk about an explosion . There had been one man who might have started the change , averted the explosion . Max had taken a short leave , with Berg 's blessing , to work for that man , because the Century , after all , was coming out for him . The man had not won . Damn , he had sounded right ; he had seemed like the kind of guy willing to start things . People with sense , unafraid for the first time in a long while , had popped up from behind every bush , as though at the bidding of a master gardener , to lend support . Max had worked on speeches and organization and at the convention . No good , all of it . Thera were many little things that had killed the man , but none were as effective as the intellectual label . Intelligence is the enemy of thep209American people ; too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could happen here and that it would be as nothing that had happened anywhere , anytime before . Maybe the answer was that they were intelligent enough , the American people , to not want to know . The old-line people in the man 's own party had helped to cut him down . Deals , they wanted deals and could not understand why the man was not dealing . They had helped him on the way down . The man had been capable ; he might have heralded the end to the hundred years stench of Negro deaths . The other man : a nation did not move well in the shadow of a man who had performed other tasks with a Jim Crow command . It was all eating at Max now . Even before he had the lunch with Zutkin . He found himself wanting to get away and write . He wanted to do with the novel what Charlie Parker was doing to music  --  tearing it up and remaking it ; basing it on nasty , nasty blues and overlaying it with the deep overriding tragedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences to come : Herman Melville , a super Confidence Man , a Benito Cereno saddenedbeyond death . He wanted to blow the white boys off the stand  --  those who could n't blow like niggers  --  before they took the whole thing and made an intellectual exercise out of it . Goddamnit , yes ! He was going to get out . Pitch camp elsewhere and get sharpened up and rested for the battle that was coming : the battle in black and white . Max took the ship with the summer equinox . At Le Havre where cranes stud the docks as gigantic , long-limbed insects , Max looked down from the main deck and saw Harry waving ; he saw no other black faces . Max waved back . He was glad he had written that first letter ; it had led to a resumption of a regular exchange with Harry once again . Max had known when he wrote the letter , that it was a matter of pride with Harry . Who would write the first letter after that long period when Max 's letters had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Pride , one of Harry 's weaknesses ; pride over terribly small things.  |p210Max  said goodbye to the people he had come to know aboard the ship ; they rushed through the exit for the boat train to Paris . Standing beside his luggage in customs , Max could see Harry waiting for him at the exit . Through wide grins they studied each other carefully , and when Max was through , Harry embraced him . They placed the baggage in Harry 's car and Max was glad Charlotte was not there ; he 'd wanted the first few moments alone with Harry . Their conversation was swift and jovial , but the studies of each other persisted . Harry had put on some weight ; that was an ordinaryobservation . But Harry 's face  --  it seemed to encapsule some grim wisdom , some sad affirmation . " How 's Zutkin ? Shea ? Granville ? Chris ? Kenyon ? Kierzek ? " Harry asked , and without waiting for Max to reply went on . " Fill me in ; what 's really happening back there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Left Bank if you stop for a late lunch and get caught in Montmartre traffic , if you detour , but by the time they had reached St. Clair , Max was almost talked out . Harry , pausing from time to time to curse French drivers ( " These bastards over here do n't seem to realize that cars can kill you . Just like Africans . " ) , went back to the time of his departureand told Max all the things he had n't known then about the American Lyceum of Letters , the deal with Don Kenyon ( the book had n't done well ) , and all the little hurts ; the sudden flare-ups betweenCharlotte and himself . " That incident changed my life , " Harry said , driving crisply through the swollen green Norman countryside . " They made me mad . They made me a writer . " South of St. Clair , the traffic heavier , the gray , ugly factories more frequent , Harry turned to Max and said with sudden and curious warmth , slapping him on the knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vive la France . You 're going to work here . You 're going to sit down and write . Paris is the place for it . It 's going to be a special thing because they do n't shit on you here if you say you 're a writer , You can say it and not feel ashamed . Every writer ought to do it , come to Paris , if only for once in his life . Goddamn , Max , you lookp211good . A little tired . Them crackers been running the shit out of you , huh ? " They both sat in warmth for several miles , not talking . Max leaned his head back on the seat . " Dawes is over here , you know , " Harry said . " I gave your address to Granville and he gave it to Dawes . " " Yeah , I know . Do n't see too much of him . Travels in another kind of crowd . And there 's another cat here . Three weeks ago , I think he said . Roger Wilkinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight as I 'd let him get , which was n't very much . Young cat . Says he 's writing , but I 've never seen any of it . Have n't seen him in a few months . Had to set him straight . " " Woman ? " " Just a friend . " " How can a man have a woman for just a friend . Baby , you 're slipping ! " " Long story . Tell you about it sometime . Funny . Wilkinson never said anything to me about coming over here . I thought he loved the civil service . " " What , was he a social worker ? " " Yeah . " Harry laughed . " Boy , I tell you , those white folks back there got the best of everything . Now they got so many Negro social workers listening to Negro problems they do n't have to be bothered with them anymore . " " I guess that 's what he did . I never asked . " " Well , I hope he produces . Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can . However hard or evil the hustle , they still think it 's better than putting up with that nonsense back home . By the way . That Dawes has been on my ass like white on rice . Essays . He 's really been stomping me . " " Why ? " " How in the hell would I know ? I suppose it 's easier for spades to run each other down than paddys . You know . "  | " I 'm really in France . Really in France . " " Damned if you are n't . " After a while , quietly , Harry asked , " How 's Mississippi ? Just as bad ? " " It 'll get worse . All of it . The whole goddamn place . " " That 's too bad . You keep hoping . " " It 'll get better . " " But you just said  --  " " After it gets worse . " " Yeah . I got you . How 's the hunting ? " Max said , " Falling off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see too much out there anymore . " He was remembering the last time he 'd gone hunting with Harry and shot the deer . The day he discovered that Charlotte had lied to him . Well , then , they had known each other fourteen years . Where had the years gone ? " Got one bird last fall . I was out all morning . Ricketts ' place . " " He still in business ? " " Yeah . I think he 's even printing dream books now . " They laughed . " Women ? " Harry asked with a smile . " Catch as catch can , " Max replied . He had gone through a very dry spell in the weeks before he left . Ending everything . He had n't wanted to borrow any trim and he was n't going to lend any joint . Clean slate . Ledgers balanced . " It took you a long time , it seems , " Harry said . " Catch as catch can ? " Harry 's laughter , booming , filled the car . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about that in Paris . I mean getting back to writing . " " Yeah , " Max said . " Well , I had to learn the other world . I mean , sleeping with white women is n't the whole thing . You can learn tho men from them , though , but you 've got to see them in action , the white boys . These guys run the world and when I stop and think about that I either get scared or mad . " " Some world , man . "  | " Hip . " " Tough , your man losing the election . They liked him here . Good tongue ; good head . The other cat  --  well , it 's a good time to be away . " The sun had been bright that day and there were many cars on the road , the sun 's rays glinting from their tops . Before taking Max home , Harry swung up the Champs toward the Arc de Triomphe . " Look at that motherfucker , Max , look at it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sayre-Coeur , the Sorbonne , pausing for a drink here , a drink there ; they became high , not merely from the liquor , but from each other , and being in Paris in summer ; and that night in his room in Harry 's house , where he was staying until his own flat a few blocks away was ready , Max looked out the window . Paris . Paris ! And Harry burst into the room with another bottle , just as though he knew Max would be at the window looking out . . . I 'm sorry the letter went on to get you into this mess , but in your hands right now is the biggest story you 'll ever have . Big and dangerous . Unbelievable . Wow . But it 's a story with consequences the editors of Pace may be unwilling to pay . And you , Max , baby , come to think of it , may not even get the chance to cable the story . Knowing may kill you , just as knowing killed me and a few other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't quit now ! It was too late when you opened the case . This is a rotten way to treat a friend . Yes , friend . We 've had good and had times together ; we 've both come far . I remember that first day we met at Zutkin 's . We both saw something we liked in each other . What ? I do n't know , but it never mattered to me . Our friendship worked ; it had value ; it lasted . I 've run out of acquaintances and other friends who never were the friend you were . So , even if this is dangerous for you  --  and it is  --  I turn to you in friendship and in the hope that you can do with this information what I could not . Quite frankly , I do n't know how I got into this thing . It just happened , I guess , and like any contemporaryNegro , like a ghetto Jew of the 1930 's in Europe , I could n't believe it was happening , even when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Jaja Enzkwu 'll be here next week , " Harry was saying . Max had been in Paris a month . They were the first at the cafe where they took midmorning coffee . " How is he ? " Max asked . " A prick , " Harry answered . " I 'm going to tell you before Wilkinsonand the other cats get here . Africa is in for trouble . If the white man knew what 's going to happen to that continent when he leaves it , he 'd change his mind , but he knows what he 's doing , and them dumb niggers are falling flat on their faces . I would n't tell anyone else this , but that place crushed me . Enzkwu . In Africa and out of Africa , he 's always talking about how much he hates whites . Told me the only reason why he puts up with me and Charlotte is because he likes me ; we 're brothers ' says he . But that man goes stone out of his mind , stone , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I did n't keep a close eye on him , he 'd have his hand up to his wrist in Charlotte 's crotch . That 's just the reason he gets out of Africa so often . " Max , bent double laughing , did not see Wilkinson 's approach , but Harry did . " Cool it . " Max , who found himself laughing more and more at Harry 's secrecy , as much as his comments , was still laughing when Roger arrived , pulled out a chair and sat down . Harry flashed a quick , amused glance at Max  --  the kind of glance exchanged when you 've allowed an outsider ( who almost too quickly takes advantage of it ) to thrust his way into your group . Wilkinson ordered coffee and croissants and joked with the waiter . " Where you learn all that French , boy ? " Harry asked , mocking paternal gruffness . Roger smiled shyly . ( He always did the right thing , said the right thing at the right time , Max recalled . ) " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger laughed . " You know what they say  --  psychopaths usually are good at languages . " He laughed again ; broke himself up . Generally , the passing of a beautiful woman sparked part of i he daily ritual , the " lying and crying . " Harry : in Spain ; a girl who had an apartment in Gaudi 's La Pedrera on Paseo de Gracia in Barco/Iona . Roger : two girls in a tourist-class cabin aboard the Flandre , hopping from upper to lower berths . Max : a church-going landladyin a Tunica , Mississippi , boarding house . Harry : a girl in Pekingwho was lean and soft . Roger : A geisha in Tokyo while he was in the Army . And on , until the others  --  a couple of musicians , an actor and an opera singer  --  joined them . Then politics , mostly concerned with U. S. racial problems , replaced the girls . But not until Roger , seeing a tall , firm blonde pass by , announced that next he was going to Scandinavia , where the pussy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of every open bottle of Aquavit . If they stayed at the cafe long enough , soon , it seemed , every American Negro who was in Paris passed by or joined them , like the nightclub singer , Iris Stapleton , and the drummer she went with , Time Curry . Marion Dawes never stopped . He passed at a distance , usually , waved at no one in particular and continued on , his regular entourage of at least two companions at his side . " The only time he ever really talks to me , " Harry mused one day , " is at those Franco-African meetings . " And yet , one night when Max had had dinner with Harry , Charlotteand the kid , the phone rang . " Dawes , " Harry ducked back into the room to announce . While he talked , Max and Charlotte edged into a conversation . Charlotte 's alert , disdainful New York look was gone . Her face was beginning to assume a slight , perpetualfrown , as someone with constant migraines . She seemed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . On the whole , she looked fine . She too had put on weight , but carried it well for a big woman . Harry returned . " He wants to borrow some money . We 'll meet him at the cafe , okay , Max ? " " Sure . It 's on the way home and I 'd like to meet him . " " He 's got his goddamn nerve , " Charlotte said . " After all the rottenthings he 's written about you  --  " Harry pulled on a jacket and said , " Ca n't let a brother starve , baby . Says he has n't eaten in three days . "  | " How much ? " Charlotte said . " We 're running through money like water . The family fortune is n't unlimited , you know . " In the middle of buttoning his jacket Harry stopped and dropped both hands . Then he said very quietly and wearily , " Baby , it 's all right . " But Max had heard distinctly the warning in his voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ferocitythat she obviously wished to direct at Harry . Little Max walked Max to the door . He needed his own child . How did that saying go ? " Ai n't got chick nor child . " Max and Harry walked quickly to the cafe , Harry frowning all the way . They never went to the cafe at night ; now it was a strange , dingy place with weak lights and faded tablecloths . Marion Dawes sat huddled at a table in a corner . He was very dirty and he looked tired and bloated , like an exhausted beetle trapped . His round dark face was slack , but he managed to stand and give a weak smile when Max and Harry approached . Harry said first thing , " Hungry ? " Dawes smiled again and nodded . " But I can manage if you let me have the francs . " " The meal wo n't be deducted from the loan , " Harry said , just short of being curt . They sat down . Max said to Dawes , " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " Dawes said . His hand went briefly into Max 's and was withdrawn . Harry signaled the waiter and ordered , without consulting Dawes , soup , a steak with fries . " You do n't have to  --  " Dawes was trying to say . " You 'd better eat , Dawes , " Harry said gently . " I 've been hungry . Nothing looks right , feels right or sounds right . Nothing is right . Go ahead and eat . We 'll get a drink . " " Thank you , " Dawes said , taking the francs Harry passed t him . " I 'll pay you back as soon as I can . " " Sure . " Max sat back and studied both of them as Harry looked at Dawp217who was bent over his plate . He was hungry , but he ate neatly , pausing to smile and say , " Sure is good . " When Dawes was drinking his coffee , Harry said to him , " How come you 've been attacking me , Dawes ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mop of hair glowed dully in the cafe lights . " Well  --  " he began . " You make it sound as though we know each other . You know that 's untrue . We 've spoken to each other exactly five times and I spoke more than you . You 've never been to my house , and I 've not been to yours . What is this ? What are you running me down for ? And now  --  I 'm not putting you down because anybody can have bad luck  --  you call me to borrow five hundred francs . I got a family and I 'm a long way from home , too . All right . I understand you 're having bad luck . But why call me to help you after you 've been running me into the ground ? That 's what I ca n't understand . " Dawes 's voice broke from him high-pitched and sharp . " It 's the duty of a son to destroy his father . " Max watched Harry recoil . Harry then looked Max full in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once a puzzle , flooded with understanding and rejection of that understanding . Gruffly Harry said , " What in the hell are you talking about ? I 'm not your father . " Dawes loosed an exasperated gasp that sounded like a hiss . " Harry , well , if you do n't know  --  you 're the father of all contemporaryNegro writers . We ca n't go beyond you until you 're des-troyed . " Cautiously Harry said , " You 're crazy , man . You 've been hungry too long . " But Max noticed a sudden gleam rise in his eyes and then slowly fall . Dawes finished his coffee in Harry 's lingering siknce . " Really , " Dawes said . " As soon as I can , I 'll pay you back . I 've got a couple of pieces on desks in the States right now . " " I hope they 're accepted , " Harry said . " But are n't you working on a novel ? " " I 've just finished it . "  | " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 've got to go . " He shook hands with Dawes and then Dawes , turning crisply , took Max 's hand . " Mr. Reddick , I 'm sure we 'll meet again . " Whistling , Dawes merged quickly and plausibly with the shadows that lay close to the cafe . Max and Harry stood watching and listening . " That motherfucker'sgot some nerve , " Harry said with a suggestion of admiration in his voice . " Let 's go . I have to think about this one . " After walking some distance , Harry stopped and said : " Do they really think that , these young guys , of me being the father of Negro writers ? " " Yes , " Max answered , remembering how eager he had been to meet and talk to Harry ten years ago at Wading River . " We 've been thinking it a long time . " " We ' ? " Harry laughed . " You trying to destroy me , too ? " Max laughed . " No shuck ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away too long or you 'd know you 're the father . " " Too long ? " Harry scoffed . " Do you think they 'd let me back in without hounding me to death after that visit from Michael Sheldon last week ? I got news for you : no . I 'm also getting a little tired of France . Not enough brothers here for me . But where else can I go ? I tried to get a permanent visa to live in England  --  no dice . They wo n't let me live in Spain . All I have to do is to show up at the frontier once more and you can forget about old Harry , writing about Franco Spain like that . Africa ? I 've got nothing in common with Africa . " Harry laughed and the sound was rich and full . " Man , I 'm dangerous ! " Dangerous or not , Max observed , Harry was the darling of the French intellectuals . Several times it happened that they met at partiesto which Harry thought Max had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to Jean 's , did he ask you over ? " But when Ma x was invited , he would ask if Harry were going and Harry would grumble and run the host down . But he would show up at the party and seldom , it seemed , was able to break away and exchange a fewp219words with Max . By the middle of that fall , Max had come to understand . Harry 's friends were very much like his books : they were not for lending ; they were his . He had bought or written them , and he was n't going to let them get out of his sight  --  or be shared . But Max enjoyed the gatherings because most of the people who went to them spoke English . There were times when he hungered for the sound of it ; sometimes the cafe did n't count because the talk was often about race or women and sometimes politics . He longed for talk of people and doings and he did n't mind if the English was badly pronounced . At other times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions , prices , buy food and carry on a light conversation with his concierge or a woman . Michelle Bouilloux , who usually attended the affairs with her husband , a short , plump poet from Avignon , made Max speak in French . She waited while he searched for words or stumbled over them . Sometimes she supplied him with the word he was seeking and then laughed , heartily , showing her white teeth and letting the ceiling lights play on her red hair . Max liked her and envied Harry . I Iad Max not known of her affair with Harry he would not have conceived it ; Michelle seemed unattainable . A souring Charlotte helped . A souring Charlotte whose brief moments of hilarity now came because of the attention paid to her by Jaja Enzkwu . Knowing Harry as he did , Max was not prepared to dislike Enzkwu . On the other hand , he was not going to like him on sight , either . The AfricansMax had met at the Franco-African meetings had made him cautious . But his first meeting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was held at Andres and when Enzkwu came in , his silken agbada swirling about him , he paused and glanced about the room , then came swiftly toward Max and his date , a tiny , smallbonedbut tough magazine reporter named Janine ; she spoke BritishEnglish . Enzkwu , a Nigerian , had met her before . He much preferred the French to the British and wished he had been born in Senegal , first ; the Ivory Coast , second ; or Dahomey , third . Mostp220people , Max thought as Enzkwu swarmed around Janine , for the sake of courtesy at least , tend to guide their meaningful remarks through innocuous ones ; or they work with the eyes . There is , after all , some guideline for these sorties and it was usually observed between a man and a woman trying to come together , particularly in the company of others . There were no guidelines for Enzkwu . He simply ignored Max and gave his full attention to Janine , pausing to adjust his sleeves and to puff rapidly on his Gauloise bleu . His eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing . Max was embarrassed for Enzkwu . He knew the laugh . Pig . That was what Janine was thinking . But one must be nice , mus n't one ? And not offend our black brethren . Max knew that when Enzkwu got the message that he was being put down ( and he would believe Janine was putting him off simply because Max had got there first ) , the message would be garbled . For Enzkwu ( and Max knew the type ) , every white woman who was courteous to him was really offering to share her bed with him . " So , you will not go dancing with me tonight , " Enzkwu said , scowling at Max . But his eyes were already searching the room . " I will call you tomorrow , then . . . " " No , Jaja , not tonight . Thank you , you are a dear . Tomorrow I have an interview . Adenauer is in town , you know . Yes . Ta-ta . " Enzkwu rustled away , heading for , Max could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every rustle of his agbada . A momentary , floundering silence came between Max and Janine . " Say it , it 's all right , " Max counseled . " Oh , Max , " she said , tiredly . " What does one do ? I find him loathsome . To think that he may even become a First Cabinet member  --  and I did n't want to offend you . " " What 's he got to do with me ? " " You 're right , of course . Nothing . Well  --  " " You people have got to stop being so foolish . " Max was both sad and irritated . " Do you like the Germans ? They are white . "  | " No . You know I do n't . " " Well , then , is n't it the same ? " " I 'm sorry . I knew we 'd have words about it . It 's the reaction , you see , bending over backwards . " " Stand straight up for me . " Janine smiled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , and then , watching Enzkwu swirl away from Michelle and veer toward Charlotte , he had promptly dismissed him . God , Max , what does n't start with Africa ? What a history still to be told ! The scientists are starting to say life began there . I 'm no scientist . I do n't know . But I do know that this letter you 're reading had its origins with what happened there . Let me go back to the beginning . I doubt if you 've heard of Alliance Blanc . In 1958 Guinea voted to leave the French Family of Nations , and at once formed a federation with Kwame Nkrumah , or Ghana , whichever you prefer . The British and French were shaken . How could countries only two minutes ago coloniesspring to such political maturity ? Would the new federation use pounds or francs ? The national banks of both countries were heavily underwriting the banking systems of the two countries . There would be a temporary devaluation of both pounds and francs , whether the new federation minted new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what really rocked Europe  --  if the federation worked , how many new , independent African states would follow suit ? Then , what would happen to European interests in Africa after independence and federation ? Was it really conceivable that all of Africa might one day unite , Cape to Cairo , Abidjan to Addis ? Alliance Blanc said Yes ! If there were a United States of Africa , a cohesiveness among the people  --  300 , - 000,000 of them  --  should not Europeans anticipate the possibility of trouble , sometime when the population had tripled , for example ? Could n't Africa become another giant , like China , with even more hatred for the white West ? It was pure guilt over what Europeans had done to Africa and the Africans that made them react in such a violent fashion to African independence . The white man , as we well know , has never been of so single an accord as when maltreating black men . And he has had an amazingp222historical rapport in Africa , dividing it up arbitrarily across tribal and language boundaries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it requires the same passion for getting along with each other in Europe . But you know all this . All I 'm trying to say is that , where the black man is concerned , the white man will bury differencesthat have existed between them since the beginning of time , and come together . How goddamn different this would have been if there had been no Charles Martel at Tours in 732 ! TouRS . Except for a few phrases found in the encyclopedias , its meaning had been lost in history , perhaps intentionally , Max rememberedthinking when he and Harry had stopped there on the way south to Carcassonne to buy smuggled Spanish shotguns . Somewhere between Tours and Poitiers , Charles Martel had halted the Moors driving up from Spain in , the encyclopedias said , " one of the decisive battles in history . " There was a stinging clue , Max thought , as they were taking lunch in a cafe along the Loire . Otherwise how white would Europebe ? Or America , for that matter ? They misled you , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they destroyed the histories of the vanquished carved on stone stelae and wrote their own . Was Alexander 's chief captain , Clitus the Black , black after all , or only by nature , like Nero ? How could Balthazar of the Three Kings be black when historians wrote that black people came out of the ass-end of history ? How then could Balthazar he king of anything ? But at Christmas who questioned ? You got your gift and you got drunk . Go , Balthazar . Why could n't they tell you straight out who was a Moor ? They told you a Moor was a Berber , a Saracen , an Arab , anything to keep you from knowing that Berbers , Saracens and Arabs were often black . But the Spanish knew ; how well they knew . ( Max had gone on a brief trip to Madrid and had been there only long enough to know that Spanish womenp223did n't like to remove their brassieres when making love saving the contents for the kiddies and to hear the Spanish whisper loudly to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mira ! Mira ! Un moro ! " Max had heard the history resounding in their voices . ) So great a conspiracy , Max thought ; the extent of that conspiracy which , conscious or unconscious , had the same effect . It really was too much . What they would n't do , the white folks , to keep you from having a history , the better , after all , to protect theirs . Max had felt empty walking beside the Loire after lunch ; he even felt stupid . There was so much he wanted to know , but never would know . How wonderful it would be to be able to read Arabic ; what answers would come from that ! Or classic Chinese to understand what had happened to the great Chinese navies and find a clue , perhaps , to the presence of black people in the Melanesian islands of the Pacific . How did they get there ? What immense traffic in goods and people took place between China and Africa , and in which dawn of which history ? Caught up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon which he walked , the snorts and neighs of horses , great , ungainly Percherons against small , fast , surefooted Arabian steeds , the jangle of armor , the shouts in Old French and Arabic , the lung-bursting cries for god and country , as usual . Harry broke into his thoughts . " Goddamn . " Max glanced at him , then followed the direction of his eyes . Coming toward them , motionless above the knees , was a small , wrinkled Negro . He was wearing a beret faded to an ugly purple ; a white shirt out of which sprang in every direction a huge , red , polka-dotted tie , the kind which had not been seen since the days of Bop City in New York in the midforties . He also wore a zoot suit and highly polished black knob shoes . The man , as black as his shoes , his lips as red as the inside of a watermelon ( he would have gone well in a 1930 's Hearst caricature of a Negro ) , moved steadily across the green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his back and pushed him forward.  | " Professor Bazzam , " Harry said hurriedly . " Hello , hello , " the man called Professor Bazzam said . " I saw you people cooling it along the river here . Have n't seen you in a couple of years , Harry . " He took Harry 's hand and shook it , while studying Harry keenly with myopic eyes . " Came down here for a bit because Paris was getting too crowded , know what I mean ? " Turning to Max , he said , " You from the Apple ? How 's the Apple ? You like this side of the ocean , man ? Nice , is n't it ? Everything 's cool here . " Max had n't heard New York City referred to as " The Apple " in fifteen years . The Professor , Max estimated , was at least sixty years old and he was , in the flesh , the kind of Negro every white man laughed at and pointed to . Yet there was about Professor Bazzam ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfpossessionone sees in clowns performing before thousands in MadisonSquare Garden . What great penance was the man paying to degrade himself so ? Looking at him closely , Max could see that the Professor had n't combed his hair ; it stood balled and napped on the sides of his head as berries left for the birds after the passing of the berry picker ; his suit had n't had a cleaning or pressing in months ; the white shirt collar was ringed with dirt . Of all the black American characters Max had met so far , Professor Bazzam was the oddest . Even standing still his forearms were held forward , his hands bent toward the ground , like a bird 's legs seeking to come to roost . Harry and the Professor finished their brief conversation and Bazzam stuck his gnarled hand into Max 's , pivoted and marched off , nothing about him moving save his legs . " See you in Parce . " His knob shoes sliced neatly through the grass and expertly topped the small stones . Harry shrugged , and anticipating Max 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is . He pops up in the strangest places : Paris , where I first met him ; London , Amsterdam , Munich , Berlin , Stockholm , Copenhagen , Barcelona . Nobody knows who the hell he is . When he shows up , he reminds all the Negroes , who 'd like to forget it , that they are ; they do n't like to be reminded . I wish to hell he 'd getp225a new suit and throw away that tie . " Harry shook himself with irritation . " He 's like a bad penny or a conscience . " The next day they continued south to Carcassonne and purchasedthe Spanish guns . Then they returned to Paris along the Rhone via Macon , roaring down the highways bordered with ancientplane trees that had white rings painted on them ; passing the ugly French farms , the farmers and their families with centuries ' old dulled looks ground deeply into their faces ; passing giant wine tank trucks and Max thought , How different after Paris , just as all America is different after New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , months from now , when he 'd have to take that fourhourdrive to Le Havre again to the ship that would carry him back to New York , the Century and the future . It would be time then , for the book would be finished and perhaps he would be tired of Paris . But there was plenty of time yet . Time for hunting in the fall ; he would be disappointed if French pheasant and duck were as similar to American pheasant and duck as French women were to American women . A change in locale did not make Max lose perspective ; a woman was not better in bed simply because she was French . The same did not apply to French wines , however ; they were better . " How goes the book ? " Harry asked . " Good . " Max struggled from the grip of his own thoughts , suddenly aware of the long silences they had had on the trip north . Well , he assumed that Harry , like himself , did n't like long , drawnoutconversations on the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be all right . " Harry glanced at him . " Sure would like to take a look at it . But I 'll wait until it comes out . " That tone of voice , Max thought , knowing what the tone and the words meant . Most rigidly observed by writers who are friends is the rule that one never reads ( or asks to read ) the work of another while that work is in progress . Harry was aware of that rule , yet , however you cut it , Max thought , Harry had asked . Did Harry think he was in it ? Did Harry want to be in it ? Max knew that a lotp226of people thought they were in novels or wanted to be in novels , but he 'd never thought Harry was like that . Then watching the suburbs of Paris , Moret and Fontainebleau rush up and slide behind them , Max knew what it was . The old jealous bit ; Harry thought he would have reason to be jealous of the novel . Goddamnit , Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me against you ; it 's you against them working out of your bag and me against them working out of my bag ; us against the bad guys . Harry 's unanswered question hung heavily in the car until he started to whistle tunelessly . Then Max hummed a tune and finally they came to Place d'Italie and Harry became involved with the heavy traffic . Max breathed a little easier , but he knew Harry would never forgive his unspoken refusal to let him read his manuscript . By autumn Max was feeling like an old Parisian . The steady flow of Negroes from America , he noticed , was on the increase . During their first few weeks they savored Paris to the full , then a few of them drifted off to be seen occasionally selling the Herald Tribune in front of the American Express office or sitting glumly in the cafes in the Quartier , speaking their high school or college French which of necessity was becoming sharpened with the flavor of Paris . It was one thing to quit New York or Chicago or San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet that Paris was n't going to welcome them with open arms because they were discriminated against in the States : if you had no money , the world discriminated against you . Generally , the newcomerswere young . Their hatred for the United States was loudly and volubly voiced . Still , it seemed to Max that what they had suffered was , after all , negligible . Perhaps America 's blacks were getting soft . Max seldom saw the older Negroes , the ones who 'd come after World War I , except in passing through Neuilly or San Gervaise or other sections that did not throb and seethe as the Left Bank . Sometimes he saw middle-aged mixed couples , expatriates , walking arm in arm , speaking English . They were unnoticed except by otherp227Negroes . Max wondered how life was for the mixed couples , how it had been , what had caused them to come to Paris . He would watch them walk out of sight along the quays or in the Tuileries. 0 , beautiful for spacious skies and amber waves of grain . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look of triumph , as if to say , You see , we French are different ! That difference , of course , making them better . That implication was always there . It was in the hundred little clubs that Max saw other American Negroes with their French men or French women listening to bop , France 's latest American import . And he saw them when the great musicians from the States came through on tour , Ellington , Parker , Davis , Mingus , Roach , Mulligan . Most of all , Max noticed the white Americans in Paris in their often inadvertent contacts with Negroes . Gone now was their selfassurancethat an entire nation was behind whatever they chose to do or say to a Negro . If a Negro was with a French woman , the white Americans might glare or ignore them altogether ; some ranklingembarrassment kept them from seeking any middle ground . White Americans who at home would not be caught dead trying to smile at a Negro , did so in Paris when recognizing a Negro as an American by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut dead . Smile at me at home , the sullen Negroes seemed to be saying , not in Paris . In Paris I do n't have to give a good goddamn about you . Early in September , after having Paris largely to themselves duringAugust , the tourists went home . The new Negro expatriates cast about with increasing desperation . Summer was over and so was the first flush of Paris ; they had to be set for winter , somewhere , somehow . Requests for loans of francs came more frequentlynow . The one restaurant in Paris that served food homestylewas crowded with Negroes waiting to meet other Negroes who might be able to put them onto something . Others resigned themselves to the mean hustles that would carry them through their first Paris winter . Max watched all this grimly . He recalled the nine months he was out of work . Would Paris have been better than New York ? He admired the youngsters . Starve in Paris first , ratherp228than in New York where you 'd starve and get your ass kicked too . He hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that it was becoming in many ways very much like home . Then they 'd do all right , those kids . But none of them would be Josephine Bakers or Redtops ; the French were over their black exoticism . The kids would be just people , which would be all right for a change , if things just held steady . When the first autumn chill hit Paris , Max and Harry took Little Max with them on a hunting trip to Viviers to try out the Spanish guns . Harry , Max remembered , had driven the entire distance with a furrowed brow , and Max knew that the reason they had driven so - far and fast was to put as much distance between Charlotte and Harry as humanly possible in three days . Little Max was along not so much to be introduced to the sport ( Harry was often both sharp and short with him ) as to deprive Charlotte of his presence . Once , when they had paused at the end of the shooting for cigarettes and cognac and were watching Little Max handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Max was surprised . That was another rule he 'd broken . You did n't talk about each other 's girlfriends until you had brought her name up . " Okay , " Max answered . Had he and Janine been seeing that much of each other ? Harry snorted . " I 'm glad she 's French . If she were American I 'd have to kick your ass ! " He shouted to Little Max : " Hold it higher , boy , higher ! " Harry sat down upon a hummockof grass . The late afternoon sky was tinged with greens and reds . " Sometimes I wish I had n't left the States , goddamn it ! " " Getting to you ? " Max asked . " To me ? You mean through me . " Harry sighed and watched his son . " I sleep badly . My work is n't going well . I wake up in the morning sometimes and wonder who in the hell is this broad next to me . Charlotte . " He sucked wetly on his cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back into the States without being hounded to death , what would it be like for me  --  hell , forget it . I feel this way every fall when the tourists have gone . I miss the accents fromp229Nebraska and even Mississippi . When we first got here , I used to sit in the lobbies of hotels where Americans would be , just to hear their voices . I miss Harlem too . The summer . The first warm day when everybody gets down in the streets , lying and crying , and it 's hot and muggy , the niggers are evil and the jukeboxes are blaring and you can smell fried chicken and barbecued ribs in the air on any corner ; I even miss the cops holding up the corners in threes and fours when the summer comes . And the watermelon cats , holleringand jiving and getting rid of those melons as quickly as you 'd spit out a watermelon seed . How I miss it . " " Yeah , " Max said with a slow smile . Harry said , " Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make things better . Here I am writing about Spain and China and Africa . If we solve the problem at home we solve it around the world . " " What 's solved around the world could also solve it at home , " Max countered . " Yeh , I feel that way too , sometimes , like there 's more I can do . " Harry grinned cruelly . " I 'll bet . All summer I 've been watching you while you were noticing the happenings . I 'd say to myself , Look at old Max . Digging it all . What does he think about it ? Me , I talk too fucking much to notice anything . " Then Harry laughed and it was kind of a release . " That 's what you are , Max , a noticer , a digger of scenes . Max the Digger ; Max the man . " " Get off me , Harry . " " Man , I ai n't never been on you . " Harry eased his bulk down between his legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagram a football play on the ground . " You 're anal , man . I mean tight . Like you 're determined to be the only cat surviving this whole mess . It 's hard to get to you , Max . You never got over that girl , Lillian . You write good . You knock me out , but open it up a little . For myself , I wonder where it went . I do n't feel it anymore . Maybe being away . I do n't know how a guy keeps the feel of it . " " You have n't lost anything , " Max said . " I worry about losing it.  |p230It  's tough enough worrying what the faggots will make in in any year . That 's what kills you , Harry . It 's all like women 's fashions , that 's the way it is now . " " There 's Zutkin , " Harry said . " So what else is new ? " " Like that , huh ? " " The man 's getting tired . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They stymie him , too . " " Then , there 's the being black . " " There 's that too , yes . " Harry said , " That 's insurmountable . " " That 's exciting , " Max said . " Never a dull moment . " " Ai n't it the truth ? " Harry crushed out his cigarette . Together they turned to watch Little Max hold his father 's gun and say , " Boom ! Boom ! " " We ought to clean these birds and get them on ice , " Max said . " Yep , guess so , " Harry said . " I do n't feel mad at Charlotte anymore . Y'know , sometimes all this gets to her . She loved her old man , and was sure he would n't mind . She 'd never liked her mother , but it was the mother who came through . You remember how Charlotte used to take Little Max to the house when the old man was n't there , in a taxi , at some ridiculous hour so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man died since we 've been here . Her mother came once to visit us . She 's getting on ; they always get on when you 're away from them . Charlotte wo n't come out and say she wants to go home . In a way she does n't . Here , no one stares at her when she 's got the boy ; no one curses under his breath  --  that she knows of  --  when she passes . It 's all right . I think she feels that she owes her mother her presence . All this has been bugging her and making her impossible to live with . That and the good fortune I 've had . If it had been otherwise , we 'd have no choice but to go home . Then , there 's always Michelle for her to find out about . Aw , hell . She gives herself to the kid now . Maybe you 've noticed ; you notice everything else , you bastard . " Max laughed and gathered up his birds.  |p231Winter  came and Paris was naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big deal about Paris , Max wondered , glumly , staring through his steamed window . This you could get in New York with better central heating . The novel rolled slowly ahead . On the days when nothing came or he was just too lazy to work , he fled to the museums or to the streets or spent an afternoon and evening at Janine 's , a woman who was all for the lending and borrowing of those bits of human flesh and company without ever asking for an accounting . They were good for and with each other . When he left Paris she 'd find someone like him ; chances were that before him there had been some guy he had resembled in the ways that mattered to her . If he could , Max would find someone like her in New York , but they did n't grow that type as thickly in the States as they did in France . If he did not see Janine or go to the museums , he walked the sodden streets , peering into cafe windows to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new expatriatesand treated them to drinks or meals in the restaurants that lace the tiny streets in the Quartier . Whatever he did , his single concern was with his novel . New York , his job and all the people he knew there seemed from another time when he had met them only in passing . There were times when he thought of a person in New York , pictured that person , but could not call up the name . Except Regina . He thought of her with pale , swift concern . He had received two notes from her . The first asked , when he had been in Paris two weeks , if he had caught the clap yet . In the second note she said she 'd never had a desire to return to Europe , and felt that those who had earlier escaped it were foolish to go back to the slaughterhouse just because slaughtering had stopped for a season or two . Not once did Max think of Shea until a letter came from him , asking if Max would consider working for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return ? Roger Wilkinson reappeared , claiming that the Swedish broads were great , but he could do without the winters . The group still took coffee in the mornings , but they 'd have to brush the steam offp232the windows so they could see who , head bent against rain , snow or wind , was passing . As usual , rumors filled the cafe : Dawes was going home soon . His book was finished , sold , and he had got a nice piece of change . He would be missed at Les Halles where , when he had money , he and his streetboys would sit in one of the cafes extolling the virtues of a rotten onion soup . An expatriate Negro , caught stealing sheets he had hoped to pawn from a little hotel on Rue Jacob , had been arrested . One of his buddies was taking up a collection from among the Negroes to pay his bail . Time Curry and his group ( he was having trouble with his old lady , Iris ) had gotten some bookings on the Riviera . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FrancoAfricans . Harry Ames ( who was not at the cafe that morning ) had insisted that true independence , when it came , meant working outside the French Family of Nations , not within it . The Africans had answered that the French , responsible for curtailing their developmentin the first place , should be willing to contribute economically and socially to the Africans and the easiest way for them to do that was for the African countries to stay in the Family . Harry then told them that what they would get would not be independence ; that the single difference with the coming of what the Africans chose to call independence would be black people instead of white people stealingand taking from black people , with the French seeing that their boys got the most . He had left the meeting in an uproar . " Slave ! " the Africans had sneered at Harry . " Negro ! " It was also in the cafe that , when winter began to loose its grip on the city , the plans for spring dominated the talk , while everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still there , had survived still another winter . " Holland at tulip time , " Harry said . " They still love me in Hol-land . " " No , man , Scotland . " " Portugal . " " Are you crazy ! " " I heard of a place tourists ai n't been to yet  --  Ibiza . Next yearp233this time you wo n't be able to get on the island . Tourists ; they 're just like flies gatherin ' over a horseball . " " Tangier , that 's the place they tell me . " " Yeah , sure , " Harry said . " Every place under the sun but black Africa . " Everyone laughed . " We 'll take you at your word about Africa , Harry . " One of the musicians said , " We ought to take up a collection and send Professor Bazaam down there . Would n't he be a smash with his Apple shit , them knobs and that four hundred-year-old suit ? " " We know where Max is going to be come summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They looked at Max , smiled and said nothing , each with his privatethoughts of home , the good thoughts of home which , seconds later , were ambushed and wiped out by the bad ones . " Back to the paper ? " Roger asked . " I do n't know . I 've got an offer from Pace . " As soon as he said it , he wished he had n't . The eyes swung toward him again and fell away . Max could almost hear their thoughts : Here they were , by the dozens , wondering where their next meal was coming from , not all of them , but a great many of them , and there he was , Max , just like them , spade , boot , nigger , with a job waiting at Pace  --  everybodyknew Pace  --  and another book almost ready and advances were going out of sight these days . Whose ass was he kissing , this Max Reddick ? Had to be kissing somebody 's ass . Otherwise a spade just do n't make it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Max cleared his throat and asked Roger , " When are you going home ? " They always needed social workers in the States . Things were getting rough for ditch diggers , but they were clamoring for social workers . Progress . " Sometime in the summer , " Roger said . " But I tell you , man , it 's mighty appealing over here if your bread does n't run out . " " Maybe I 'll go back one of these days , " Harry said absently . " For a visit . "  | " With your luck , " one of the group said , " you 'll probably wind up back in Africa and Dawes will wind up the greatest Negro writer ever . " Harry nodded wryly . " Strange , Africa . Really . You 're glad to get away from it , yet something keeps pulling you back to it . " " Oh , man , " someone said . Harry smiled . " Go . Just once and you 'll see what I mean . It 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , planted a seed deep inside you . You may hate Africa with all your heart , the way it is now , and the way the white folks like it ; you may rant and rave about how bad it is , but you seldom turn down a chance to go there . " Harry laughed somewhat self-consciously . " It 's in your skin , you see . " Everyone at the table laughed again , heartily . Max could n't concentrate ; his thoughts kept flying off . He put Harry 's letter on the bed and lit a cigarette . He glanced at the window . About one o'clock . He wondered what Michelle was doing downstairs . It seemed quiet . They should n't have had those drinks . In the old days , yes . Lunches in New York , seeming to fly down Madison Avenue after three martinis and two stingers . The old days when no one was ill , and liquor and cigarettes put a fine edge on any part of the day , even in the morning , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm beer at eight in the morning in Kano in northern Nigeria , when the temperature was already over oo  --  . Max frowned . He was drifting again . He brought Harry 's letter back before him . Was it true ? Had he never heard of Alliance Blanc ? The letter continued : The Alliance first joined together not in the Hague , not in Geneva , not in London , Versailles or Washington , but in Munich , a city topheavywith monuments and warped history . Present were representativesfrom France , Great Britain , Belgium , Portugal , Australia , Spain , Brazil , South Africa . The United States of America was also present . There were white observers from most of the African countries that appeared to be on their way to independence . The representation at first , with a few exceptions , was quasi-official . But you know veryp235well that a quasi-official body can be just as effective as an official one ; in fact , it is often better to use the former . I do n't have to tell you that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrecy . They were moved from place to place  --  Spain , Portugal , France , Brazil and in the United States , up around Saranac Lake  --  Dreiser 's setting for An American Tragedy , that neck of the woods , remember ? America , with the largest black population outside Africa , had the most need of mandatory secrecy . Things were getting damned tense following the Supreme Court decision to desegregateschools in 1954. 20 PARIS  --  NEW YORK1954 May 17 ! How they celebrated that day ! They gathered at the cafe the morning of the 18th more briskly than usual , glancing searchingly at each other , the Paris , London and New York papers clutched nervously in their hands . " Do n't mean a thing . " " Looks like some very powerful shit to me , man . That with all deliberate speed ' means just that . " " But you know Charlie and Miss Ann ai n't going to sit still forthat  --  their kids in the same classroom with black kids . " " Charlie ai n't got no choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it 's got to be a fake-out . " " Wonder how they 're taking the news back home . Max , write to us when you get back , hear ? Goddamn these papers ; I want to know what our people are saying about it . " " Those peckerwoods  --  there 'll be another Civil War . " " Or a stateside Mau-Mau uprising . " " All right , let it come then . " " Yeah , with you three thousand miles away . " Laughter . " Suppose it turned out to really be something ? "  | " And we did n't celebrate . Let 's celebrate , because it might start a whole new bag back there . A whole new day . " " That makes sense . Sure , let 's order a little taste . " " If it 's the real thing , I might have to pack up and go home . " " Time enough for that . Time enough . " At the end of the celebration , which lasted two days , in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven Max back to Le Havre . Max 's leave was up ; his book was finished . " When are you coming back , Max ? " Max countered with , " When are you coming home , Harry ? " " Never mind . Just put the blocks to them , man . " " You too , Harry . " Passengers pushed and shoved against them . " I probably wo n't be coming home at all . This is home now , for better or worse . " " Not ever ? Not even now ? " " A man could raise hell there now , yes , " Harry said . Then proudly , " But you 'll all have to look back to me . " " Dawes too ? " Max asked . " Him most of all . " " Give Charlotte my blessing , the kid too . And Michelle . " " Yes , of course . You 'll come back , wo n't you ? " " Maybe . How can you tell ? " Max walked Harry to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back to work , " Harry said with a sigh . " Keep your head low and your chin covered . " New York remained unchanged , a testimony to its strength against the minds of millions of people who leave it every year and expect that with their departure , something about it will change . When the ship had come into the harbor , he thought of the people he wanted to call right away . But once unpacked and haviii checked to see that his subtenant had n't ruined the place , Max decidedthere was no one he wished to call that day , and he dug out the liquor he had hidden and fixed himself a drink . He expected and received no trouble from Michael Sheldon.  |p237Senator  Braden 's Un-American Affairs Committee had been washed away by the eloquence of a lawyer from the Midwest . His third day back , Max called Shea . He had to talk about the Pace job before reporting to the Century . Shea invited him to dinner at his apartment that night . The apartment was in the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Max arrived in a belligerentmood . He had had a shoving match with the doorman who had blocked his passage and asked in a nasty tone who Max wanted to see ; finally backed off and allowed him to get on the elevator . As soon as he 'd shaken hands with Shea , he started to complain . Shea listened , his face flushing . He called downstairs and ordered the doorman to come up . And apologize . " I do n't give a damn what the house rules are , " Shea said loudly . " When you see Mr. Reddick , you let him in without a word . You tell the other doormen too . If I have any more trouble like this , I 'll have your head . " The doorman flushed . He did n't know if this was one of the elaborate games the liberal tenants sometimes played or not . If it was , Mr. Shea played rough . If it was n't , what the hell was he going to do if some nigger waltzed through the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every other one . The doorman apologized ; he 'd take the matter to the agent . " Welcome back to New York , " Shea said dryly . " You can see that things have n't changed that much . " " No , " Max said . He sighed with relief . He had been so close to corking that sonofabitch right in the mouth , so close . Max looked around . Shea had a view of the Avenue down to the Washington Arch . He 's done well , Max thought , very well . And here I thought I was raising hell in a couple of shabby rooms in Paris . Hell , I was doing better . Max had forgotten about the opulence one can find inside even an ordinary building in New York . If I had been white , he thought . . . Shea fixed him a drink . " Look , Max , we can talk about Paris and Harry after you tell me your decision about Pace . We 're most anxious to know . We expect things to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desegregation . I'llp238be candid with you : We want Negroes on the Pace staff . Sooner more than later , everyone 's going to look around and find that they are n't clean ; they wo n't be able to point to the South . We want to start with someone who knows the South , who knows something about the Negro mood , generally . I 'm telling you this . At the office someone else would tell you something a little different , but it would amount to the same thing . Also in the future is a desk in Africa  --  maybe . This Mau-Mau business has us half expecting the whole continent to go . You 'd get first crack at this if it came about . Now , you 'd work out of New York , in National Affairs , but when you 're on assignment , you 'd work with bureau people in that area . You 'll have to learn our systems , but that 's a small problem . What do you say , Max ? You can name your price . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his head , nudged by the doorman and Shea 's current luxury ; it had no basis in reality . Max looked boldly at Shea . His hair was the same gray ; yet he seemed to be growing younger instead of older . The white boys get all the breaks , Max thought , knowing it was a thought to be laughed at . Max wondered how it was with women for Shea these days . He hoped he would have the good taste not to go into it , even if he got high . Shea nodded . " That 's in the ball park , " he said . Max swallowed his drink . In the ball park ? In the white folks ' ball park ! His father had had to work over five years to make what he was going to make in one . What was this , a welcome to the white folks ' ball park ? Max wondered suspiciously , What if I had asked for more . Would I still be in the ball park ? Shea went to the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Congratulations . You 're on the Pace staff now . I only wish I could have done the same thing a few years ago when I was on the paper . Now , I guess , you 'll have to talk with Berg over at the Cen-tury . " " Christ knows we ca n't pay that kind of money , " Berg said . " Well , I knew it ; it was inevitable . They all sit back and wait and then they buy out the poor bastard who made it possible . What am I to do , stand in your way ? How ? It 's a free country , more or less ,
