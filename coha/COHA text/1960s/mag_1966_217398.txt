With the opening of the fourth annual New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center only a month away , a tabulation was made of this year 's entries . There will be one picture each from Russia , Spain , Japan , Hungary , Yugoslavia and Belgium , two from Italy and France , and four from Czechoslovakia , which has lately become a hotbed for avant-garde films ( TIME , July 29 ) . Fine , but how many were entries from Hollywood , which makes **32;4677;TOOLONG ? Answer , as of last week : none . <P> <P> That was curious indeed , since a supporter of the New York Festival is the Motion Picture Association of America , the trade association of the major Hollywood studios . What is even curiouser is that eleven domestic pictures were submitted to the Lincoln Center selection committee , and all were rejected as " not of festival caliber . " Then it turned out last week that the selectors had tried to get one Hollywood picture , The Fortune Cookie ( with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Artists . That prompted Cookie 's producerdirector , Billy Wilder , to suggest that United Artists was " scared of the snobbish , intellectual types of audiences and critics " in New York . " After all , " he quipped , " my picture was not made in Czechoslovakia . " <P> <P> The truth is that for all their public plumping in behalf of U.S. representation in film competitions , U.A. and the other M.P.A.A. members are privately wary of festival juries and reviewers . The festivals are concerned with artistic values , the studios with commercial ones . Even if a Hollywood entry should be praised by festival press previewers , the distributors fear that the papers would give the film less attention later on , when it counts-in its general release . " Festivals are fine , " sums up one studio executive , " for Polish , Russian and Czech companies . They have nothing to lose and a great deal to gain . " <P> But there are many film makers who believe that international festival com petition is the only way that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Producer Robert Radnitz , who was a panel member at last year 's New York Festival , thought it was " a great festival . The most exciting thing was the number of young people who came , despite the high ticket prices . If kids will go out and pay that much money to see foreign films , it drives another nail into the coffin of the Hollywood syndrome of catering to the twelve-year-old mind that even twelve-year-olds never had .
