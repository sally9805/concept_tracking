" There 's an East Berlin and a West Berlin , but tonight we 're sitting with the best Berlin , " sang Danny Kaye at a gala Beverly Hills banquet where Composer Irving Berlin , 74 , accepted the Milestone Award of the Screen Producers ' Guild . It was only the second time ( the first : to Bob Hope in 1962 ) that the Guild 's award for outstanding movie achievement had been presented to someone other than a producer . President Kennedy , ex-Presidents Eisenhower and Truman telegraphed their congratulations . And then , " with great pride , " surrounded by a boodle of filmdom 's most glittering stars , the old tunesmith clogged every throat when he hopped to the piano to God Bless America , as only Irving can . <P> <P> " I had a vision , " said Sara Bartholomae , 47 , " and in the vision I saw John Glenn 's space vehicle . ' ' So the ex-beautician , who last December won a $5,500,000 divorce settlement from oil-rich William August Bartholomae , announced that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Mercury 7 on her Brea Canyon ranch near Los Angeles . " It will be open to the public for meditation and peace of mind , " says Sara . She plans to have the chapel completed by Feb. 20 , 1964 , the second anniversary of Glenn 's triple orbit . <P> <P> Occasional Actress Linda Christian , 39 , onetime wife of the late Tyrone Power and self-styled " woman of the world , " thought she saw a Ford in her future , but her engagement to Actor Glenn Ford , 46 , was brief even by Hollywood standards . After a candlelit dinner , they both phoned their happy news to Los Angeles Columnist Harrison Carroll . Came the dawn , and Glenn was on the phone again . " Ridiculous , " he snorted . They were " only kidding . " Not so Linda . " Glenn proposed , " she insisted . " He was so nervous he had three helpings of Wiener schnitzel . I think he should go to a rest camp . " Instead , he went out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fickle heels : " Drop dead-and I 'm not kidding . " <P> <P> The U.S. Mint clinked out 3.4 billion new coins last year , and still finds itself so short of change that it expects to produce 5.1 billion coins annually by 1970. and 7 billion by 1975 . Where does the money go ? For one thing , all those vending machines and parking meters , says Mint Director Eva Betrand Adams , 54 , are gobbling up nickels and dimes as fast as her plants can turn out fresh ones . " However , the real culprits may be collectors . " There used to be about 2,000,000 coin collectors in the U.S. , says Eva , " but today there are up to 8,000,000 . What 's more , people once saved individual coins or rolls of coins , now they save bags full . " <P> <P> A bunch of the beards were whooping it up at a Greenwich Village Java saloon called The Bitter End and one of the poems recited was Ode to a Champion : Cassius Marcellus Clay . Its author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 , getting ready for his Madison Square Garden skirmish this week with Heavyweight Doug Jones . Quoth Cassius : " The word 's been passed around that I 'm a very charming guy. / the greatest fighter that ever lived , / and I 'll gladly tell you why . . . " Of course if he turned out to be wrong , Cassius could just call himself a beat poet . <P>
