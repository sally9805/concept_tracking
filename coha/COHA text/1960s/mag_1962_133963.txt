As the gun fires to send Weatherly and Gretel across the starting line on Saturday , it will be the 18th time in 92 years that a challenger has tried to carry home the trophy won by the schooner America under the eyes of Queen Victoria . None has succeeded  --  in 55 cup races spanning almost a century , the defenders have lost only five . // By present standards of sportsmanship , not all of the challengers have been given a fair chance . This is not the case with Gretel . Seldom if ever has an overseas invader in any field been helped so far along the road to victory by a nation anxious to make things equal . " It 's hard to tell where the American part ends and the Australian begins , " exclaimed an observer last week . From her epoxy-paint bottom , smoother than a gun barre , to the aluminum extrusion that forms the towering mast , Gretel is indebted to her host country . Winches , rigging wire , many fittings  --  even sails  --  have been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were tested in a model tank in the un-down-under city of Hoboken. // Contrast this generosity with the attitude toward Cambria , the first British vessel to make a foray , in 1870 . She was required to sail a single race against a fleet of 23 crack yachts . For the next challenge , despite published protests that a " match should be won when made , " it was conceded that the invading Livonia would be pitted against a single boat , but there was still a catch : the committee reserved the right to name her adversary on the morning of each race , depending on the weather . Four potential defenders were ready , all best in different strengths of wind . As recently as 1958 there was a stricter interpretation of the clause in the deed of gift stating the yacht must be " constructed in the country to which the challenging club belongs . " // When I sailed aboard Sceptre in England four months before the last cup races , the crew expressed a wish for enough Zeta cloth  --  a lightweight , strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I promised to send them some if the cup committee expressed no objection . It did . The late Commodore W.A.W. Stewart , chairman of the committee , informed me that sending American fabric to a challenger might violate the country-of-origin clause . Now , under an obviously relaxed interpretation of the clause , Gretel Helmsman Jock Sturrock is able to say : " We have available a full complement of Hood and Ratsey sails to use  --  if we want to . " // This is not intended to belittle the Australian achievement . But it is true that without a relaxation of the rules by the present cup committee there simply could not have been a challenger from down under . No one unfamiliar with the complexity of a modern 12-meter yacht realizes the technological background necessary to its production ; while harnessing the wind for propulsion may be anachronistic , to do it competitively requires an extensive leavening of aerodynamic materials and techniques . // There are not likely to be any secrets on either side . The Aussies followed the early trial races closely  --  a boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she lost her mast , and picked up the crew member knocked overboard  --  and are familiar with every phase of American starting tactics and sail-handling methods . During the week after the selection of a defender the rival vessels stood side by side on the ways of Newport Shipyard as final modifications took place , all work open to mutual inspection . // Gretel , incidentally , effected a rather major change for so late in the season by moving the mast forward 19 inches . " She has always had a weather helm , " concedes Designer Alan Payne . " It did n't seem so bad back in Melbourne , but it seems bad here . " Jock Sturrock , now that he has been named helmsman , is delighted . " Nothing I dislike more than fighting the wheel . I have a Payne-designed sloop of my own back in Australia , and she balances perfectly . Gretel will be better for the change . " As the headstay has been shifted a matching distance , no recutting of sails is required . At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American system of blocks and mainsheet lead adopted . Now little remains of the Australian attempt to break away from standard 12-meter practice except the linked coffee grinders for handling head-sails ( SI , July 9 ) . // Thus Gretel will meet Weatherly as closely equalized as it is possible for boats of widely different origins and national backgrounds to be . Yet , as the series of trials to choose a defender has proved , it is impossible to be certain of the relative abilities of yachts in match racing until they meet in actual competition  --  and even then superiority may hinge on the whim of the winds and vary from day to day . // The known advantages of Weatherly begin with the men on deck . Bus Mosbacher has proved himself the outstanding helmsman of this era , both in his grasp of tactics and his ability to make a boat move through the water , especially to windward . After four years of watching Bus on the starting line I am still amazed at his knack of bending almost any situation to his advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timing  --  not just the minutes ticking away on the starter 's chronometer but how the boats will come together after sailing different courses at different speeds . No matter what his opponent may do , Mosbacher is usually where he wants to be when the gun sounds . // Backing up Mosbacher in the cockpit are shipmates from Vim four years ago  --  Dick Matthews as navigator and Don Matthews as mainsheet man and tactical spotter . Forward is Vic Romagna , veteran of both Weatherly and Columbia . Adding Buddy Bombard and Doug Mercer , six of the 11 men aboard were blooded in the ' 58 campaign . The teamwork necessary to perform intricate yet split-second maneuvers can only be gained through competition , and the Weatherly team has had ample . // Weatherly achieved 15 victories against five defeats in the trials , but Gretel is an unknown quantity . Her yardstick has been the venerable Vim , whose present capabilities can only be judged by her failure to win a single race during this year 's New York Yacht Club cruise , against five victories in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start their first big-boat match race on Saturday when they come up against Bus Mosbacher and Weatherly . This is something like trying to lasso a tiger the first time you see a tiger . // On the challenger 's side is Sturrock 's proved ability under pressure in other classes , a rigorous training program with much hard drill , a crew chosen after almost two years of tryouts and what might best be called the Aussie competitive flair  --  the determination , dedication and dash that have carried a small nation to the top in other sports . // The weather also may be on the Australian side . Unless Gretel is capable of the biggest surprise within memory , Weatherly must be considered the fastest yacht of her class ever built in light and moderate winds , say up to 15 knots . Changes in ballasting have vastly improved her stability , and beyond question she now qualifies as a good all-round performer , not likely to be outclassed in any conditions . But how far up the velocity scale her power extends is a matter of question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went well during the final trials in winds of better than 20 knots , but somewhere in this area the challenger might begin to give an interesting account of herself . // I can not forget watching from Gretel 's cockpit her enormous superiority over Vim while going to windward in a rail-down breeze ( SI , Sept. 3 ) . While some observers who have watched from astern feel she , too , may be a trifle tender in. a blow , I was impressed by her drive through the seas , her ability to point high and foot well and the smartness of her crew in tacking  --  as well as the angle between tacks , fully as good as Weatherly's. // While meteorological records do not indicate appreciably stronger average winds in mid-September than in midsummer , for a few days anything could happen . Not only is it the season of the equinox , but already the fresh chill gradient winds of autumn have tinted the trees of Newport . Come zephyrs between frontal systems , expect Weatherly in a walk . But come a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might develop drama sadly lacking for the spectator fleet in recent cup matches , as well as in the trials this summer .
