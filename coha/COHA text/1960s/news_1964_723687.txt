txt American philanthropic foundations have assets totaling 314.5 billion , an increase of 33 billion since 1960 , a survey by the Foundation Library Center showed yesterday . The foundations are now making grants at a rate of $779 million annually , an inIlcrease of more than $150 million since the center 's study of 1960 , Ithe new study showed . Education , which receives $315 million a year , continues to be the leading beneficiary of foundation grants , but its share of the total has been slightly reduced in the last three years . Support for international activities has moved up from ' sixth place to second . In the tabulation of 1960 , international ' affairs received less than $33 ' million ; this category can now count on about $106 million a year . More Educational Aid All indications are that this trend will be accelerated . Although complete figures for 1963 are not yet available , it is expected that education 's share will be shown to have declined to about one-fourth of the total , from a high of 41 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those for education by the end of 1964 . Actually , the lion 's share of the money for international activities goes to educational institutions . International studies get 39 per cent , or $20.3 million annually , and 22 per cent , or $11.5 million , is generally earmarked for education in international affairs . Support for international activities has included such grants as $250,000 by the Carnegie Corporation of New York to Northwestern University for research on inter-cultural relations . Such on-the-spot projects as a $265,000 gift by the Ford Foundation to the National School of Law and Administration in the Congo are also included . Similar grants have // equipped science laboratories in Latin America , nursing schools on Taiwan and medical schools in the Philippines . They have also given funds to American universities to assume direct responsibility for training their own students for service abroad , educating foreign students on American campuses and establishing direct cooperative relations with institutions in new nations . Support for the humanities is on the rise , largely because of the new and liberal support for the performing arts , mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1963 , the humanities received $20.5 million , $4 million more than in the entire preceding year and more than half of it for the performing arts . It is likely that the humanities will soon be tied with the sciences , with both moving up to third place . Activities Are Analyzed For the moment , however , the lineup still remains : education , $315 million , international activities , $106 million ; welfare , $96 million ; health , $90 million ; sciences , $86 million ; religion , $46 million , and humanities , $40 million . The data come from a 1,000-page volume , the second edition of " The Foundation Directory , " prepared from foundation reports and Government records , and edited by Ann D. Walton and Marianna 0 . Lewis . A detailed analysis of foundation activities was prepared by F. Emerson Andrews , director of the Foundation Library Center . The report was published yesterday by the Russell Sage Foundation The survey lists and describes 6,007 of the more than 15,000 foundations on which the center has files . The 6,007 either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grants of at least $10,000 in the latest year of record . The center defines the modern foundation is " a non-governmental , nonprofit organization having a principal fund of its own , managed by its own trustees or directors , and established to maintain or aid social , educational , charitable or other activities serving the common welfare . " First Modern Foundation The major categories of foundations are general research , special purpose , community , company-sponsored and family . The first substantial foundation that is believed to have met , the modern definition was the Peabody Education Fund , established in 1876 with a principal sum of $2 million " to aid the stricken South . " But a foundation type of fund was set up as early as 1791 by the will of Benjamin Franklin to assist " young married artificers " of good character with $300 loans at 5 per cent interest . Foundations are found in every state of the union . The greatest concentration is in New York , with 1,594 , or nearly 27 per cent of those listed . With many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all foundation assets , or $8.161 billion , are concentrated there . The Ford ! Foundation 's assets alone amount to $3.3 billion . New York , New Jersey and Pennsylvania account for about two-thirds of the nation 's foundation assets . California and Texas were singled out as states with sig- ' nificant foundation growth in recent years , with Texas showing an upsurge in foundations with large assets . Texas is now the fourth state in terms of foundation assets . Since the end of World War II , Texas 's foundation assets increased 25 times . The study showed the proliferation of foundations to be a recent phenomenon . Of more than 5,000 foundations for which the date of origin is known , only 18 were organized before 1900 . Relatively few were organized before 1940 . But 1,638 new foundations sprang into existence in 1940-1950 , and in the next 10 years 2,839 were chartered . More than 88 per cent of all existing foundations have been established since 1940 . Six foundations today have assets exceeding $250 million . They are , in the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Duke Endowment , the John A. Hartford Foundation , the W. K. Kellogg , Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation of . New York . One hundred seventy founda tions have assets of $10 million or more . These 176 foundations together have combined assets of $11 billion , or 76 per cent of the assets of the 6,007 listed in the survey . The total assets of the unlisted ones are negligible . File Federal Returns Mr , Andrews noted that attacks on foundations , especially by Congressional critics , often referred to the existence of ; more than 45,000 foundations.I This is merely the number of information returns received by the Internal Revenue Service on Form 990-A , he said . While foundations are also required to ' file this form , the great major ' ity of those who file it are not foundations but civic , welfare and religious organizations . The most recent category of Ifoundations is that of industrial corporation sponsorship as a means of corporate giving . Almost half of all companysponsored foundations in the directory were organized in the four high-tax years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and although they control only about 8 per cent of all foundation assets , they have ' been making 19 per cent of all grants in recent years . In other words , they do not build up endowments . Family foundations have also had a spectacular growth beginning with the high-tax years of World War II . Nearly 60 per cent of the foundations in the survey , about 3,500 , fall into this category , but they control only about 16 per cent of all foundation assets . Nearly all existing large general foundations of today began as family foundations , Mr. Andrews said . The foundation part in the nation 's philanthropy often appears exaggerated . Foundations account only for about 8 cents of the annual dollar of private philanthropy , the survey found . Foundations are sometimes criticized fo rhaving somewhat peculiar purposes . Mr. Andrews noted that two Prairie Chicken Foundations , one in Illinois and the other in Wisconsin were devoted to the preservation of " that magnificent bird , an inseparable part of American tradition . " Mr. Andrews said it was dangerous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He point ed out that the Ford Founda1 tion started in 1936 with an endowment of only $25,000 . Nor is it safe to ridicule some ! seemingly peculiar grants . Often cited as the classic example 's the work of Prof. Robert H. Goddard , who in 1920 asked for a grant " to put a pound of gunpowder on the moon . " Professor Goddard received support from the Smithsonian Institution and the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation and performed research that was later recognized as the key to the development of the multiple-charge rocket . " John Brown 's Body " was written by Stephen Vincent Benet on a Guggenheim Foundation fellowship . The white lines on American highways were first promoted by the Dorr Foundation . The Foundation Library Center , which undertook the study , is at 444 Madison Avenue . It maintains a reading room open to the public , with detailed information on all American foundations . A branch office of the center will be opened today at 1327 18th Street , N.W. , in Washington .
