RICHELIEU by D. P. O'Connell . 436 pages . World . $10 . <P> It was the worst of times : the first half of the 17th century . Spain rotted . The German principalities writhed . Sweden , France , Spain and even Switzerland were seething with religious mania . The European peasantry was regularly picked over by tax collectors and aimless bands of soldiers detached from all allegiance . Trade patterns kept collapsing . The gaudy corpse of feudalism weighted the Continent , but there was nothing , apparently , strong enough to winch it out of sight . <P> Yet such a force was being created , and on the Continent its principal inventor was the despised and sickly rationalist , Cardinal Richelieu . What Richelieu devised at home was the modern European state . France was his working model , and as its most powerful Minister of government , he developed a strong , centralized , departmental administrative system that , to some extent , endures today .

It is hardly possible to overstate the treacherous confusion that Richelieu 's Europe presented to any would-be diplomat . The Thirty Years ' War ( 1618-48 ) turned much of the Continent into a wasteland . Alliances flickered on and off like fireflies . Richelieu did his work , too , in a time of witch burning and archaism . His very closest adviser and friend , a shrewd Capuchin named Pre Joseph ( for whose shadowy role the title Eminence grise seems to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yearning to renew the crusades against the infidel . <P> French social order ensured disorder . Soldiering and conspiracy were almost the only trades open to the younger sons of an already partly superfluous nobility , and many of them saw fit to follow both . Friction between Huguenot and Catholic never really ceased . Conspiracies against Louis and Richelieu coagulated regularly around Gaston , Louis ' vain and frustrated younger brother , and Marie de Medici , their harridan mother .
