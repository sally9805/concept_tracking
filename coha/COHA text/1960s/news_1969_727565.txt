Cohen , said yesterday that all antipoverty programs should be improved by " politically insulating " proved programs , by transferring them from the Office of Economic Opportunity to older Federal departments . In the Netherlands . yesterday , the police in Venlo said Mr. Coeppicus opened an account under an alias with the Banque Populaire Suisse in Zurich last Dec. 12 . In German , the bank is called the Schweizerische Volksbank . The police said the checks amounted to $1,017,615 . They refused to confirm that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession of District Attorney b Hoean , but the checks Mr. Hogan has are for the following amounts : $340,063.38 ; for $105,366.80 ; for $106,005.59 ; and $466 , - 179.24 . These add up to $1 , - 017,615.01 . Some time after the account was opened , the Zurich bank led Mr. Coeppicus to believe that the checks had been presented for collection without problems , the Venlo police said .

The payee on all of the checks is the city 's Department of Finance and a concern called Pagliuca Associates . There is a Pagliuca Associates in New York City , and its owner , Angel Pagliuca , has been questioned by the District Attorney 's office . No action , however , has been taken against Mr. Pagliuca , who asserts he has no knowledge of , the checks . The fact that the checks were slopped by The Chase Manhattan Bank here avoided any loss to the city and the banks involved .

It was made out to the name Saul Belinsky and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles . The check was supposed to have paid for a $50,000 house in Los Angeles purchased from Allen C. Woodard , a real estate broker . In an interview with The Times , Mr. Woodard had said he saw Mr. Bellnsky only once ? to make the deal ? and later told Mr. 13elinsky in a telephone call that the check was no good . Amplifying a statement published in The Times on Tuesday , George Nicolau. former head of the . Cnmmunity Development Agency , said yesterday that Congressional delay in financing the Office of Economic Opportunity , had left the C.D.A. strapped for cash late in 1967 . The financial pressures , he said , was the reason he had transferred $5.2-million in health-aid money from the City Controller 's office to other programs in the Community Development " Agency . About $5,000 of the funds , according to the 0 . E.0. ? which later objected to the transfer on the grounds that the money had been earmarked for hospital programs only  --  was lent to four employes of the Human Resources Administration , including Mrs. Helyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was discharged for ' refusing to answer questions about the embezzlement of $22,000 in Neighborhood Youth Corps funds . The following are detailed explanations of some H.R.A. problems : Lack of O.E.O. Inspectors Hampers . Local Agencies Federal officials ? in the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington concede that a shortage of inspectors to monitor programs hampers local agencies such as the Human Resources Administration . ? We are definitely shorthanded  --  terribly , " said one regional official who declined to be identified . According to O.E.O. officials , besides ? yearly independent audits , checks of grants and programs are limited within the agency to understaffed inspection and auditing divisions . The inspection division for the Northeast region of the Office of Economic Opportunity consists of three inspectors , according to James Gallagher , supervisor of the inspection division in the region , which includes New York City . Besides the approximately 150 programs . within H.R.A. 's Community Development Agency in the city , the inspectors must monitor hundreds of programs in about 150 other agencies in the New England states , which have budgets totaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . The auditing division in the Northeast region consists of about nine persons , including the clerical staff , although auditors may he called from other regions for special investigations . The report by a team of Labor Department investigators dated Aug. 19 said : " Wide variations were found in the quality of on-the-job supervision received by the en rollees . Unfortunately , however , in the majority of the instances where it was possible to observe on-site supervision , the impressions formed were negative . Supervisors frequently were absent from the sites or were ignorant of the objectives of the Youth Corps program and of the whereabouts and activities of the enrollees . " A typical example of this was the situation encountered at a work-site provided by United Bronx Parents a delegate agency that handles poverty funds . Although there were 29 enrollees assigned to the building in which the organization is housed , only six could be located on the day that the.project was monitored . " The staff members who allegedly supervised them could not remember their nnmes nor could they recall precisely what their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worksite indicated perfect attendance for every enrollee thrmighoti I a four-month period . " The report later added that there were no accurate statistics on job placement by H.R.A. 's Manpower and Career Development Agency , but investigators concluded " that those enrollees who obtain permanent employment do so , for the most part , as a result of their own efforts . " " Very few openings are located through MCDA , " the report said . " There is in fact reason to believe that some agencies would prefer that enrollees continue for as long at possible in order to avoid reduction in staff as a consequence of reduced enrollment levels . " Asked about the Youth Corps report ' last night , Mr. Ginsberg referred all questions to Commissioner Cecil Tyson of the Manpower Career and Development Agency . He said the Youth Corps was within Mr. Tyson 's area of responsibility . Mr. Tyson was not immediately available for comment . Cohen Proposes Transfer of Program Secretary Cohen , who was one of the founders of the antipoverty . program urged that " tested and proved " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to separate Federal departments . The Secretary , interviewed in Washington by telephone , recommended that O.E.O. be used solely for " innovation , experimentation , surveillance and evaluation . " Mr. Cohen said that the transfer to Federal departments would " insulate politically " the antipoverty program , which he said was now subject to myriad pressures . Mr. Cohen said that by " insulate politically , " he was not referring to " partisan politics , " but rather to the conflicting demands of " a Mayor Daley , an Adam Clayton Powell , Upward Bound and the Blackstone Rangers . " " As things are tested and work , they should become part of a larger department , " Mr. Cohen said . Secretary Cohen remarked that the antipoverty agency 's Community Action Program " went too fast too far in an area untried and fraught with great difficulties . " " They tried to eat all three meals during the day at one sitting , " Mr. Cohen said . Commenting on disclosures of inefficiency and corruption in H.R.A. , Mr. Cohen said : " Any disclosures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger program . " Mr. Ginsberg , asked to comment on Mr. Cohen 's proposals , said of the transfer from O.E.O. to separate Federal departments : " Basically , I agree with that point of view , as long as for a reasonable period of time the program is monitored by O.E.O. in order to preserve the experimental nature of it . " I have a little concern that if all the popular programs that appear to he going well are taken out of O.E.O. , then O.E.O. becomes more vulnerable to political attack . I would stage out the transfer of these programs , so that they would . always have one or two for selfprotection . " Mr. Ginsberg said of Mr. Cohen 's view on the Community Action Program : " It did move faster than any of us thought it would , but I 'm not at all sure that these are things that are that easily controllable . Once you expose people to participation , it 's hard to turn them off . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
