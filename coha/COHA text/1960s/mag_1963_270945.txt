SOUTH KOREA <P> When General Park Chung Hee ran for President eight weeks ago , he was so confident of victory that he held the most honest election in South Korea 's history . The result was almost disastrous ; he squeaked in with only 43% of the total vote . Thereafter , Park 's Democratic-Republican Party vowed never again to risk such a close shave . Last week , as South Korea elected a new National Assembly , things were a lot closer to normal . <P> Victory was essential for Park , because the Assembly , though virtually powerless in most other respects , has the constitutional right to institute impeachment proceedings against the President by a simple majority vote . Disregarding election laws , government officials campaigned for Democratic-Republican candidates , and police made house-to-house canvasses . So blatant were some of the tactics that Park was forced to sack two Cabinet members to still the opposition outcry . At the same time , to build up his regime 's democratic image , Park ordered an amnesty for political prisoners , publicly permitted exiled former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native land ( ailing in Hawaii , Rhee declined ) . From Washington , where he had gone for President Kennedy 's funeral , Park sent back pictures of himself and President Johnson , had them reproduced and plastered all over South Korea . <P> On election day , the opposition parties accused Park supporters of stuffing ballot boxes and registering children as voters . Some of the charges were undoubtedly true , but connoisseurs of Korean politics decided that , despite the backsliding from the pure presidential balloting , the proceedings were still far more honest than a lot of other elections in the past . Result : of the 175 seats in the National Assembly , Park 's party won a smashing 110.
