For reasons of realism as well as low costs , Hollywood directors have for years sought their scenery abroad . But television , content to develop its talent for staging the eruption of Vesuvius in a studio closet , has rarely ventured far afield . Next season , viewers will see a brave pioneer bust out of the closet onto the Cte d'Azur and points north . The pioneer : a hammy comedy serial about an American nightclub act in Europe titled Harry 's Girls ( NBC ) , which is filming 13 of its 26 half-hour shows on the French Riviera . <P> On hand will be a team of nine Americans , eight Englishmen , 50 Frenchmen and one Spaniard . Some will do the acting ; others will handle the cameras as they sweep across the endless strips of white sand and incredibly blue bays .

They should make most viewers forget about Harry .
