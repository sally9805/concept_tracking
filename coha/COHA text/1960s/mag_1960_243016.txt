Back from 17 days of traveling , talking and trenchering through Russia , a five-man delegation representing the World Council of Churches last week reported that , despite repression , religion in the U.S.S.R. is remarkably " rich and intensive , " and that Russian Christians have an " ardent desire " to make contact with their fellow Christians in the West . <P> The trip was the latest move in a slow warmup of relations with Russian Orthodoxy that has been going on since the World Council 's Evanston Assembly in 1954 . The makeup of the World Council 's delegation to Russia was well designed to disprove any lingering notions Moscow 's Patriarch Alexis might have that the W.C.C. was " a political tool of Western imperialism . " Under the leadership of World Council General Secretary Willem Visser ' t Hooft ( Dutch Reformed ) , the delegation consisted of : British Anglican Francis House ; U.S. Lutheran Dr. O. Frederick Nolde , director of the W.C.C. 's Commission on International Affairs ; Greek Orthodox Dr. Nick Nissiotis ; and Burma Baptist U Kyaw Than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Songs of Welcome . The junketing World Councilmen ranged from Moscow to Leningrad , to Riga in satellite Latvia , to Etchmiadzin in Soviet Armenia , for two days of talks with Vazgen I , Supreme Catholicos of the Armenian Church , within view of Mt . Ararat , one of the traditional sites of the landing place of Noah 's Ark . There were banquets and church services , meetings with Patriarch Alexis and Metropolitan Nikolai ( Russian Orthodoxy 's foreign expert ) , talks with leaders of the Russian Baptists ( who claim a membership of 3,000,000 ) and the Lutheran churches of the Baltic States . <P> Back in Geneva and jaunty in a Russian fur hat . Secretary Visser ' t Hooft last week described the " songs and shouts of welcome , the waving of handkerchiefs , and the joy of being with Christians of other churches , the sincere desire for closer contacts with those from other lands . " How was Christianity doing ? Orthodox leaders estimated church membership at about 25 million ( total pop . 208,826,000 ) , and the theological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large ( as many as 10,000 in one service at Leningrad ) , but the question is how long they will continue under the Communists ' strict policy of cutting off young people from the church . " There are no Sunday schools , no religious youth movements , and it is a fact that most of those we saw in church were over 35 years old , with a majority of them women . " <P> Truths for Troubled Times . Church leaders are under close supervision by officials of the Soviet Government 's Council for Religious Affairs . " These are full-blooded Marxists , of course , " said Visser ' t Hooft . " But some of these atheist supervisors have developed a real liking for their job and show a deep interest in church affairs and history . After all , there may be found in England and Sweden and elsewhere government functionaries in charge of church affairs who are agnostics as well . "
