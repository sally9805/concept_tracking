Oh , who owns New York ? <P> Oh , who owns New York ? <P> Why , we own New York ! <P> Why , we own New York ! <P> Who ? <P> C-O-L-U-M-B-l-A <P> - Columbia College marching song <P> Although Columbia does own a good $200 million worth of Manhattan real estate-including the land under Rockefeller Center-the boast is not literally true . But to many of the university 's neighbors on Morningside Heights , Columbia is about as popular as a slum landlord . Last week 150 demonstrators , including many sympathetic students , clashed with police while trying to block construction of a new university gymnasium on park land that some residents of nearby Harlem wish to protect . Thirteen protesters were arrested . The confrontation was the latest in a long series of emotional disputes involving Columbia and Morningside Heights , a neighborhood whose residents are a mixture of Negroes , Puerto Ricans and white intellectuals attracted by low rents , the university and such varied institutions as Union Theological Seminary and the Juilliard School of Music . In an effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired nearly $30 million worth of property on the Heights , including 73 low-rent apartment buildings and houses and nearly 20 cheap " S.R.O . " ( single-room occupancy ) hotels , some littered with prostitutes and dope peddlers . By cleaning up the worst of the rooming houses , Columbia has helped cut down the Heights ' horrifying crime rate . Nonetheless , its real estate acquisitions have been attacked at various times by no fewer than 70 neighborhood organizations , many of which accuse the university of a " racist " plot to displace poor Negroes with middle-income whites in the buildings that it has bought . <P> Separate but Unequal . Resentment at the university 's land-buying policies spilled over into the gymnasium dispute . Columbia got the city 's permission to put up a $9,500,000 building in Morningside Park , long a bottle-strewn , crime-ridden buffer between the campus and Harlem . The university plans to devote the ground floor to a free community gymnasium and swimming pool , use upper floors of the building for its own athletic programs . Although this would be the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project " a land grab " and " a desecration of a public park , " termed the facilities " separate but unequal . " The university did not help matters much by publishing architects ' sketches showing an expensive entrance facing the campus , with only a small servicelike door facing toward Harlem , giving critics a chance to scoff at its " backdoor generosity .
