When he was not covering space shots at Cape Kennedy , Reporter John Wasik 's fascination with the sky took him to nearby Green Air Park . With a parachuting club called the Falling Stars , Wasik , 29 , a reporter for the Melbourne , Fla. , Daily Times , made 17 weekend jumps , finding in his eerily placid descents a sense of euphoric freedom . <P> So strong was his love for the sport that last summer he persuaded his brown-haired bride Rickie , 22 , to share it with him . Her first jump was perfect , though she laughed about landing in a mud puddle . The second time up , last August , she left the plane in a bad body position-back arched toward the ground . Rickie became entangled in her main chute lines , her reserve chute snarled and , as John Wasik watched from the ground , she fell to her death . <P> Though Wasik had always been known as a brooding loner , he seemed to develop a new morbidity . " I feel like now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told a friend . To another he said : " I killed her . " For $4,400 , he bought from a used-car dealer the supercharged Corvette that once belonged to Astronaut Gus Grissom , careened it along Florida roads at up to 135 m.p.h . <P> Acquaintances recalled Wasik 's traumatic reaction to the deaths of Astronauts Grissom , Ed White and Roger Chaffee in the Apollo fire last January . Wasik wept , slashed his wrists , and at one point drove around Cape Kennedy pointing a pistol at his head . <P> Suit for Burial . The Falling Stars ' safety director grounded Wasik temporarily after Rickie 's death . But soon he was jumping again . Last week he boarded the club 's Cessna 182 , the same plane from which his wife had plummeted . At 3,200 ft. , he hesitated , then stepped into space . He rolled on his back , then indolently onto his stomach . In seconds , the horrified jumpmaster realized that Wasik had no intention of opening his parachute . <P> On the paracide 's broken body , which struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fallen , were three meticulous notes apologizing to the club and detailing burial instructions . At his apartment in the town of Cape Canaveral , a newly pressed suit was laid on the bed for the burial . Two days later his body was buried beside Rickie 's in a silver casket that he had selected himself . Wasik had hoped to be buried on his first wedding anniversary , but a county-ordered autopsy delayed the drama by one day .
