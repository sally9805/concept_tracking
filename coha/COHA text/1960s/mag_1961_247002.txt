Still straining toward adjournment , the U.S. Congress last week : <P> &gt;Restored , in the Senate , $533 million worth of House cuts in the Kennedy foreign aid program . As sent to a Senate-House conference committee , the Senate measure called for a total appropriation of $4,196,600,000 . For President Kennedy , who had described military-economic aid as the most important piece of legislation to go before the current session , this represented a major triumph . Of the total Senate appropriation , $1.7 billion would go for direct military assistance to uncommitted as well as Allied nations , $1.2 billion for long-term development loans , $450 million for supporting assistance to back direct military aid , $334 million for development grants to newly independent nations , $300 million for the President 's contingency fund . <P> &gt; Approved , with a House roll-call vote of 287 to 97 , a bill placing the Peace Corps on a permanent basis and authorizing an appropriation of $40 million for this fiscal year . Conservatives of both parties held out for , and got , a loyalty section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he neither believes in overthrow of the United States Government nor knowingly belongs to an organization advocating such action . <P> &gt; Extended , in the Senate , impacted-areas school aid and the National Defense Education Act for another two years . The impacted-areas bill , which benefits 3.800 school districts in the home districts of 319 House members , had been used by congressional leaders to lure reluctant Congressmen into supporting what they did n't want ( national aid to education ) in order to get what they did want ( federal school aid for their home districts ) . For example , Mississippi 's Democratic Representative William Colmer , who helped block the national bills in the House Rules Committee , turned around and voted for the impacted-areas bill , under which he will get $1,245,000 for school construction , maintenance and operation in his district . The two-year bill will diminish incentive for any general aid bill proposed next year . <P> &gt; Toyed with the semantics of President Kennedy 's proposed Disarmament Agency , up for consideration at a time when popular sentiment is more belliferous than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Affairs Committee , to the United States Arms Control Agency . The stuffier Senate had already chosen a somewhat longer hapax legomenon , the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency for World Peace and Security . <P> &gt;Turned down , in the House Appropriations Committee , a $4,000,000 request by President Kennedy to help jack up the entire Temple of Abu Simbel 203 feet above the rising waters of the Nile 's Aswan High Dam in Egypt . <P> &gt; Shot a special emergency bill to the President authorizing the General Services Administration to sell 2,000,000 Ibs. of goosefeathers and down ( used in sleeping bags , flight jackets , survival suits ) , which it has been hoarding since 1947 ( along with iodine , opium , castor oil , sperm oil , diamonds , sapphires , rubies , instruments , missiles , aluminum , tin , zinc , lead , nickel , bismuth and platinum ) . When Delaware 's Senator John Williams asked how many feathers the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization had collected , he was told that the information was classified .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
