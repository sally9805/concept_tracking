Waiting in Hong Kong for the visa that would permit him to enter Red China , Correspondent Frederick C. Nossal of the Toronto Globe and Mail was upset by a series of frustrating delays . Why were Peking 's masters keeping him out ? " I ca n't understand it , " complained Nossal , " when I can do them so much good . " <P> Peking finally got Nossal 's point , granted him a temporary visa last October , later extended it for six months and thereby made him the Western Hemisphere 's only Red China-based newspaperman . In his eight months on the job . Nossal gave his hosts scant cause for offense , generally depicted Red Chinese life in the most glowing terms ( TIME , April 18 ) . But even that was not enough : last week the Globe and Mail announced that the Chinese Communists , accusing Nossal of inaccuracy , had ordered him to leave . Correspondent Nossal could not understand why-and neither could anyone else who had read his effulgent dispatches .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
