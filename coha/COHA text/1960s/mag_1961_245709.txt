( See Cover ) <P> The crowd in the House galleries filled every seat , overflowed into the aisles . Over both the galleries and the floor of the House brooded a hush of expectancy , as if some history-making drama were about to unfold . <P> Promptly at high noon , as he has done many hundreds of times before . House Speaker Sam Rayburn swept through the door of the Speaker 's lobby and onto the floor of the House . This time something new happened , a violation of custom for which old Capitol Hill newsmen could recall no precedent : in a grand gesture of affection and respect , both Congressmen and spectators stood up and applauded the old man as he started up the steps to the Speaker 's rostrum . <P> Cursing &; Conniving . The question facing the House was whether to adopt Rayburn 's resolution calling for the addition of three new members ( two Democrats and one Republican ) to the Rules Committee , the channel through which most major legislation has to pass before it can get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . In that simple question , a mere housekeeping detail on the surface , much was at stake : Sam Rayburn 's own prestige , the balance of power between liberals and conservatives in the House , and the congressional prospects of Kennedy Administration legislative programs in the 87th Congress . <P> During the 86th Congress , in 1959-60 , Virginia 's wily old Howard Worth Smith , chairman of the Rules Committee , had made up an unsplittable conservative bloc with the committee 's four Republican members plus Mississippi 's William Colmer . Because most major bills require positive action by the Rules Committee , the six conservatives were able to use a 6-to-6 deadlock to stall any legislation they disliked . By adding two new Democrats and only one Republican , Sam Rayburn expected to tilt the 6-to-6 standoff to an 8-to-7 majority . So much was at issue in the shift that the fortnight before the showdown saw the House 's fiercest struggle for votes in many a year , a struggle that ultimately involved personal pressure from the new President of the U.S. , broad threats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both sides . <P> As usual , the prevote battle behind the scenes was what decided the outcome , and the floor debate made no real difference . " Judge " Smith complained that the Rayburn forces had granted him only eight minutes to state his case . Said he in attacking the " committee packing " : " I will cooperate with the Democratic leadership just as long and just as far as my conscience will permit me to go . " When laughter rippled across the chamber . Smith retorted : " Some of these gentlemen who are laughing maybe do not understand what a conscience is . " Mister Sam based his case on the nation 's obligation and need to back up its new President . " He demonstrated on yesterday , ' ' said Rayburn. referring to Kennedy 's State of the Union address , " that we are neither in good shape domestically or in the foreign field . He wants us to do something about that . Let us move this program . Let us be sure that we can move it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program will move is to adopt this resolution . " Most of the House rose to applaud Rayburn as he climbed back to the Speaker 's rostrum , but Judge Smith stayed slumped in his chair .
