 | " Where does he come by such outlandish notions ? " Martin turned around and gazed affectionately at his big wife ; his wife amused him . Her pale face looked lye-scrubbed , and a sour expression camouflaged native handsomeness , as if this character , like her humor , was something to he suppressed . To cheer her , he made his joke about a heavenly descent , and laughed when she would not laugh . 1 is said , " Now sweetheart , there are jaguars and anacondas here , that 's all . " Kneeling on his seat , hands resting on its top , he loomed above her , anxious to interest her in all the information with which he had prepared himself . But she was not an easy person to reach out to , and he drew back a little when her hand dropped , out of habit , to tug down the hem of her dress . " Many of these tribes consider the anaconda their ancestor , " he said . " They think their shaman is a jaguar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night . " Hazel shifted fretfully . Look at him kneeling on his seat ! Why does he kneel like that ? " Shamans , " she said . " ' That 's why the Lord has sent us here , to rescue these poor heathens from such darkness . " When he smiled vaguely , turning away , she said , " You should n't have filled your own head with such fiddle- ( addle , let alone an innocent child . All he can think about arc savages and these awful snakes and jungle animals . " Shc tried to smile at him , to show that she was not quite serious , but she could not ; the airplane had made her feel much too upset . Nevertheless , it seemed appropriate that they should undergo some sacrifice and even hardship in the performance of their Christian duty , and she was therefore content to enter a terrain so remote from the green bright plains of North Dakota , where Satan , as her father said , " had been run clean across the country . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the southern sky toward Tierra del Fuego ; the plane lost altitude . Brown wastelands of the alpine tundra surged in the cloud plateaus , and far lone huts , untouched by sun , looked uninhabited . The sky lakes of the glaciers turned dull-green , then black , and the white overcast turned gray ; clouds gasped up out of sudden  | chasms , swirled from the earth like vile subterranean vapors . Tundra gave way to chaparral , and chaparral to the trees of the high forest . The dark vapors forsook the trees and , drifting , touched the plane ; a vulture tilted outward and away . Now the airplane plummeted and slid down the east slope of the sierra . Hazel Quarrier moaned , and her husband went back to her and took her hand . The mists swarmed past the window and the cabin darkened ; lights , flickering off and on , bounced and shuddered with the plane itself , which roared confusedly in its descent through the updrafts of the cloud forest . Then the window cleared again . They had forsaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous greens , wild strangled greens veined by brown rivers of hot rain , the Andean rain , implacable and mighty as the rain that fell on those sunless days when the earth cooled . MADRE DE Dios , already in view , formed a yellow scar in the green waste . With its litter of rust and rotting thatch and mud , the capital of Oriente State resembled a great trash heap , smoking sullenly in the monotony of rivers . The three Quarriers at their plane windows were taken aback by the grim prospect ; even Billy could not mistake this devastation for an Indian village . The DC-3 slid out into its turn , over the river front , where derelict craft , misshapen and unpainted , nuzzled the bare mud bank ; the heat of the place rose to engulf the plane . Now a few figures came in sight . They stood like sentinels , as if transfixed by a sudden cataclysm . The mud streets , of a yellow-orange color , deeply rutted , were barren of all life but pigs and vultures and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud airstrip , parting a rank depressed savanna , swung into their view . A light plane and an old Mustang fighter were parked at its edge ; the fighter plane was belly-deep in weeds . Quarrier rearranged his legs so that his knees , in the event of crash , would not bend in the wrong direction . They were cer- tainly a long way from North Dakota , as Hazel had said . Except for their term at Moody Bible in Chicago , they had scarcely set foot out of the Dakotas in all their lives until a month ago , when they had gone to Florida to catch the freighter . And here they were , thousands of miles from the clean kitchens and church suppers of home , ending their second airplane ride , not at the county airport but in a steaming jungle town on the banks of the Rio de las Animas  --  River of Souls ! Such names were common in these parts , and sooner or later I lazcl would horrify herself with the translations . The people and dogs of Madre de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jungle , and this plane , which crossed the Andes twice a week , was the sole evidence of an outer world . Men and dogs in the foreground , women and children to the rear , they stared at the old machine as it lumbered to a halt . The men looked of a size , and in some hangdog way identical : small brown mustachioed halfbreeds , barefoot , in pajama tops and ragged pants and floppy sisal hats . The women , in gingham , were more various and more washed-out ; the children were in rags . All stood in ranks behind a large pale man with a pistol on his hip , a small pale man in the white cassock of a priest , and a blond man in a rich blond beard , shorts and shortsleeved flowered shirt ; this man stood with feet apart , strong fists on hips , and a fine smile on his sunburned face . All three wore shoes . The Quarriers recognized the blond man , from his picture in Mission Fields , as Leslie Huben . Quarrier stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man grinned lustily and waved at them , he grinned obediently and waved back . Then he took off his glasses and wiped them with his handkerchief , wondering how much the other knew about him . When the cargo door swung open and Huben strode forward on brown legs to pump their hands , Quarrier watched the awe appear on the faces of Billy and Hazel . Huben introduced the " Mart ' Quarrier Family " ? Hazel glanced sardonically at her husband and blinked her eyes  --  to El Comandante Rufino Guzman , the prefect of Oriente State ; this  | imposing man , in a tieless white shirt buttoned to the throat , was the first prefect the Mart Quarrier Family had ever beheld . He addressed them in a loud and worldly manner , responding to Martin 's " Buenos diets , senor " with " We arr es-spik Ingliss here ! " To Hazel , bowing formally , he spoke Spanish in a courtly manner , in no way abashed by his unshaven face , his open fly and a strong breath of aguardiente . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hazel Quarrier said , her fingers fretting on her purse . Then Martin Quarrier , last in line , took the official hand of welcome . It felt like loose stones in a damp rubber bag . The scene was observed with apparent approval by the small priest , who had not been introduced . He stood at the right hand of the Comandante , and it was now clear to Quarrier that while Huben and the priest both accompanied the illustrious Guzman , they were not themselves on speaking terms . Quarrier wondered if this small man in his white cassock was the Black-robed Opposition whose fearful defeat at the hands of Huben had been recorded in Mission Fields . Under the keen eye of the Enemy he felt more and more uncomfortable  --  far more uncomfortable , it was plain , than the neglected party , who was , if anything , amused . And his discomfort knew no bounds when the priest suddenly smiled at him , and extending his hand , said , " Xantes . " Martin said , " Howdy . Martin Quarrier . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Billy . Billy , this is Father Xantes . " Because he was uneasy , his words sounded stiff and wooden to him , and he watched with relief as Hazel , carried away by all the protocol , accepted the Catholic hand . Hazel said , " How do you do , I 'm sure . " Leslie Huben said , " Pardon me , folks . I should have made the introduction . " Billy Quarrier said , " Hiya , Father . Ever seen a Niaruna Indian ? " And the Comandante said , " Ha , ha , ha , ha . " He did not laugh these sounds but spoke them : " Niaruna ! Ha , ha , ha ! " The outburst seemed to Quarrier so arbitrary that he had to smile , but when he saw that the priest was smiling , too , and that Huben  | watched them both , unsmiling , he turned his head away as if to cough . Past Huben 's head , across the strip , he could read the lettering on the small planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U E R Z A S A R E A S and on the pocked fuselage of the light plane was scrawled : 1V oldie d1 Moon , Inc . Small Wars &; Demolition The doors of this plane were both wide-open , as if its occupants had abandoned ship before it had stopped rolling , and rushed off into the jungle without even bothering to turn off the ignition . He smiled again . Huben was following his gaze ; in the hot gusts , the hair at the crown of Leslie 's head rose like a crest . Hazel wigwagged her husband in warning , hat feather trembling . The world awaited him . " Well , I mean , it 's all so strange , " Quarrier blurted ; then the laughter came and he squawked hopelessly , like a chicken . " That little plane . . . I mean , small wars ! " He struggled to compose his face . " Are they Americans ? Is it a joke ? " He laughed again . " Martin ! " Quarrier glanced back at the tattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outlaw craft itself , but something wild and humorous and free that was suggested by that rough red lettering . Suddenly he felt depressed , as if he had entered a cold air pocket , but the moment passed and he felt fine again . " MARTIN ! What are you staring at ? My goodness ! " She had not meant to sound so peevish .  | His head half turned in the weak sun , he regarded her questioningly , a stumpy man in a baggy suit ; his glasses , thick and rimless , blurred his gaze and made him appear irresolute . Staring at his huge forehead and thin limp blond hair , at the red skin of his face and neck nicked by quiescent acne , Hazel was struck by his fierce ugliness , and wondered for the thousandth time how Billy could be so beautiful . She inspected her son , who was loitering right next to the Comandante 's leg , admiring the pistol ; to spare Billy that raw look his father had , she left his hair long on the forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked just like a choirboy on Christmas cards . She reached and patted Martin on his breast pocket and turned away from him , aware that he still gazed at her . " Oh , that airplane scared me so , " she said , not looking at him . She was ashamed of noticing his ugliness . Yes , she instructed herself , we are surely entering the realm of Satan ; we must prepare every defense ; we must . . . Why , take Madre de Dios ! Just imagine giving such a name to any place ! That 's those Catholics for you ! Billy had told all his friends in school that he was off to Mother of God . Martin had laughed , but suppose some Catholic had come along and changed the name of Chippewa Flats to Mother of God , North Dakota ? Despite herself , this idea made her giggle . Well , it is n't funny , Hazel Quarrier ; no , it is n't . Frowning , she spanked and tugged her skirt , as if to prepare it against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband by the elbow and led him off ; she followed them promptly , clutching Billy by the hand , and behind them came several desperadoes in old pajamas , carrying the luggage . The little priest trailed the party , an amused expression on his face , his hands folded behind his back . Every few minutes Hazel turned and frowned , to show these men that she was on to them and that any attempt to rifle a bag , much less make off with it , would be dealt with harshly . But the halfbreeds were not laughing or conniving ; padding hurriedly on their bare feet , they looked less murderous than thin and tired .  | Ahead of her , the sweat stains grew under the arms of Martin 's jacket ; typically , he had forgotten his summer suit and wore the Sunday serge of his own climate . Beside him , Leslie Huben walked with springy step ; she regarded the man 's abbreviated garb , his long bare legs , with mixed emotions . The God-given beauty of Leslie I ( when made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how she should react to Huben 's " modernism , " to the brown legs and hula-hula shirt . In the New Fields Mission , this young man was already a legend . A former star in college basketball , he had been called from a lucrative job in the real-estate and insurance business to emulate St. Paul : " Be ye followers of me , " he had told the Tiro Indians , " even as I also am of Christ . " This moving event had been described in his first letter to Mission Fields , the monthly publication of the New Fields Mission . He became a regular contributor , and his fervent accounts of the dark jungle won high praise . Soon he announced his intention of carrying the Word to the savage Niaruna . " I am enjoying the profits of a business deal I entered into with the Lord , " he wrote in the May issue . " Invest to Gain . The Lord has impressed upon Andy and the Undersigned the command to Go . " Andy was Huben 's pretty wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine , and there were those faint hearts among the readership at home who wanted to stay Leslie and Andy from trying to contact this fiercest of all peoples in the jungle . Mission Fields exhorted its readers : " Pray much for Leslie and Andy Huben in their brave efforts to call the Niaruna unto the communion of Jesus Christ . Let your hearts be with this young couple in Jesus , for a greater harvest of souls in the days ahead . " In the August issue Huben thanked his sponsors for their prayers : " The Lord has surely opened up this work : our Uyuyu has renounced his contact with the darkness and corruption of the Opposition , and this very day has led a band of Niaruna to our door ! We have thrilled to see this fellow Uyuyu grow so rapidly in the Lord ... " Despite Huben 's modest tone , it was quite clear that he had not only contacted the Niaruna but had administered a stinging  | defeat to the Forces of Rome . Funds were found almost immediately to sponsor another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Christmas , " A tremendous outward evidence of the Lord 's working things out to open the doors to this tribe was the sending of the Mart Quarrier Family . The day that we meet this fine Christian couple at the jungle airstrip will surely be a glad , glad day for Jesus ! " Peering about her at the scraggy lots walled in by jungle ? why , it was just like living in a hole ! ? Hazel recalled with slight discomfort this first mention of themselves in print . She was glad of Martin 's opportunity to work with such a man , yet afraid that Leslie Huben might not understand him . Martin 's history of failure was as notable as Huben 's swift success  --  suppose this little Mrs. Huben gave herself airs ? It would be too mortifying ! And all the worse because Martin was a missionary son of missionaries , an honors graduate of Moody Bible , and Leslie 's senior in experience by many years . Despite his record , he was generous and industrious and very bright  --  perhaps too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it did not seem fair that he had been transferred after ten long years at the Sioux mission , and just when he had shown some progress . Why , some of those poor people were still called " red niggers " by the ranchers , and had been living in junked automobiles when Martin got there ! Well , the Indians had been ungrateful when it came time for conversions , that 's all there was to it . They were like all reservation Indians , as people said  --  too proud to work and too proud to take . Leslie Huben would have done no better . Although the morning was still new , the heat had settled for the day , a humid breathless heat that seeped from the green walls , from the pale mists . That plane trip had exhausted her . As they neared the village outskirts , her nostrils were assailed by drastic odors : the redolence of tropic plants which filled the yards : sweet whiffs of pig dung , garbage and strange cooking ; the reek of stale water and excrement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like vomit , which Leslie said came from the sawmills on the river .  | Billy had fallen far behind , attended by dirty-looking children and a yellow dog beset by mange . The children tugged at Billy 's shirt , saying , " Ay , gringuito  --  que tal ? S-ss-t ! Gringuito ! " Fearing nameless infections , she wanted to slap them away , but Billy accepted their attentions cheerfully . Billy said , " You kids ever seen any Niarunas ? " and they jeered at him , mimicking : " Yoo kit ever sin Aniaruna ? " filly laughed with the children , though soon he came running and took her hand , smiling up at her in a bewilderment that wrung her heart  --  how could they have brought a child to such a place ! But a moment later he was cheerful once again . " Ma , did you like Father Xantes too ? I think the father is a very interesting person . " She did not bother to point out that the interesting person , who was still trailing them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pronounce his name . The children ran to alert the streets , but the dog still followed her and Billy . 1 It announced that he had named the dog New Walter , in honor of a friend in North Dakota named Walter Hubbell . Then filly ran off into an alley , followed by the dog ; the animal dodged a kick or two and caught a third . She hated the cheerful cruelty in the faces , the laughter as the dog , legs tangling in its haste to round the corner , fell on its chest and yelped . She hurried after filly , hoping that Martin would see them disappear and wait for her . By a small fire , three Indian women in coarse blouses of soiled cotton , black wrap-around skirts , nose ornaments and ankle thongs were cooking some sort of mealy cakes laid on the embers . They were attended by two men in ragged store clothes . One of these men , very drunk , was lying on his side , his head clutched between his hands , while his companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the women . The women paid tm attention to either one ; they gazed impassively at the child and at the large white woman following him . " Niarunas ! " Billy said . " Sec them ? Niarunas ! " A townsman , passing , laughed contemptuously . " Niarunas ! "  | he said to Hazel . " No son Niarunas ! Son indios mansos , son Mintipos . " This halfbreed was drunk also ; he leaned over Billy , shouting , " Ay , chico ? No son Niarunas , entiendes ? Los Niarunas son salvajes , indios bravos . Estos " ? he pointed ? " son indios mansos . " The Mintipo man turned the arc of his urine in a slow circle , and regarded the halfbreed with a grin of fear and anger . His face was swollen and his eyes yellow . Thickly he said , " Y tu ? Mestizo . " Almost falling , he gestured violently at the gathering onlookers , while his women stared into the fire and his fallen friend clutched his head still tighter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he jeered . " Caballeros mestizos . " He pointed at the dog . " Otro mestizo , " he said . When he clutched at his crotch and shook it , Hazel dragged Billy away , and the people laughed , not at the Mintipo man but at the gringos . " Dead drunk ! And at this hour of the morning ! " Hazel Quarrier exclaimed ; she felt slapped across the face . But her remark struck her as silly and scared  --  not that she would have described herself as " sensible and effectual and courageous , " yet she knew she was regarded in this way by those who knew her on her own home grounds , where good sense and diligence and moral courage meant something . In this place such qualities must be totally unfamiliar , much less effective . " What does mestizo mean ? " Billy asked her . " That Indian guy called Walter a mestizo . " " I suppose he meant mongrel , ' " Hazel said . " Now come along . " Billy looked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real mongrel ? " he said . He fell to his knees to pat the dog , which shied sideways . " C'mere , Walter , " Billy said . " I thought you were an Indian dog . I never even heard of mongrels . " When the dog came up on its belly , whining , and Billy pressed his face to it , Hazel yanked him to his feet  --  what could she be thinking of , letting the child play in this filthy street , with vultures and pigs and diseased dogs ! In a place like this , for all she knew , human  | beings could catch hog cholera . She would have to be constantly on guard . When Billy clutched at Walter , she drove the dog off with her foot . At the mouth of the alley the little priest watched over them discreetly , his arms folded behind his back . She had not recovered when , at the next corner , they were accosted by a bearded man with huge dark glasses and a gold earring ; he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this awful place , he was intoxicated . At the sight of Billy his beard cracked wide in a leering grin ; lurching backward , he raised his arms . " C'mere ! " he said , and Billy , churning forward , hurled himself onto the man 's chest , crying , " You want to look at Walter ? This is my dog Walter ! " The man tossed him up into the air , laughing insanely . " Wall-ter , " the man babbled , " Wallter ! This is beautiful , man ! So how 's wit ' you , Stud ? How 's things in the old U.S. and A. ? " Hazel did not realize at first that the man was talking English . She was tempted to declare aloud , Some people do n't care how they go about the streets ! And if the ruffian responded rudely , as he must , she would then say , And you call yourself an American ! Humph ! The idea of saying things like this amused her and she looked forward to the exchange , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not catch . The bearded one lowered Billy to the ground , eying her the while in an evil and suggestive manner . " Oh yeah , " he nodded . " The God Squad , huh ? " He had his hand on Billy 's shoulder ; when Billy retreated toward his mother , the hand fell disgustedly to his side . " You 're a very rude man , " Hazel said . " And you call yourself an American ! Humph ! " But as she passed , her eye was caught by the face of the other man ; though his face was calm , his cold eyes chilled her to the soul . Even worse , he had sniffed out her private joke and  --  why , look at that  --  he was winking at her ! " American ! " the bearded man called after her . " So who 's American ? They slung us out ! "  | " Do you think he 's a pirate ? " Billy said to her . " He was wearing an earring , did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a soft voice said . " It is amusing , no ? " Glancing back , she saw the priest , who smiled at her as if he approved , not only of her joke , but of the general fact of her existence . She hurried on . Had she imagined it , or had this man winked at her , too ? Why were people winking at her ? She was close to tears . Her heart was pounding , and the sawmill smell and the clinging heat , stoked by her anger and exertions , made her discomfort ever more acute . The people in the street stared at them , pointing ; the gringos were admired lavishly , aloud . She tried to smile at them , and look with an interest at their town , but the repetitious litter of poor shacks , the beaten citizenry and scuttling children , the shop windows , few and filthy and filled with garish imitation goods , the mud and vultures and the smell reminded her of the slum outskirts in the southern towns which she had glimpsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . The sad brown eyes , the gentle whispering enmeshed her ; never had she felt herself so enormous , such a freak . The swarming vultures with their naked heads and pale white ghostly legs filled her with loathing ; the village whined with flies . She thought , But everything is dirty ; there is nothing clean here , nothing . Her body was sweating more freely than she had thought possible ; she was startled by her own plenteousness , and felt afraid . Just as the hotel came in sight , the one car in Madre de Dios came up from behind , driven by a soldier in green uniform . The car rolled and slid on the muddy ruts , and although El Comandante smiled at her in a courtly manner , no offer was made to rescue her from the open road . Nor did solace await at the Gran Hotel Dolores , in which all of the heat and bad smell and corruption of Madre de Dios seemed to collect . The toilet alcove  --  no real toilet , but a standup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed  --  brought on the tears that she had held back all  | morning , so that she cried unrclievedly even as she relieved herself . Why have we come here ? she cried silently . What am I doing in this awful place ? Jesus said : In the world ye shall have tribulation : but be of good cheer ; I have overcome the world . Remembering this , she felt a little better .  | " The Martin Quarrier Family has arrived ! Pray much for His servants Martin and Hazel Quarrier , pray much for the Undersigned and his wife , Andy , who must try to take His Word to the savage Niaruna , for this work will surely be difficult and dangerous . All your prayers are needed , for Satan is marshaling his forces and the Opposition is ever ready to take over at our first misstep . " Since I last wrote , the Lord has heeded all our prayers , and work proceeds very well among the Tiro and M.intipo  --  all our jungle tribes , in fact , except the Niaruna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by your correspondent and are therefore closest to his own heart . These Indians are still wild and savage and go naked and drink intoxicants called Masato and Nipi , which is also known as Vine of Death , and live in a state of total barbarousness and filth and sin . Less than a year ago , these same savages killed an agent of the Opposition , by name of Fuentes . If you could see  | these poor lost souls , you would realize how confidently Satan still walks among them , and meanwhile all the men still get disgustingly intoxicated , falling down finally in a stupor . " On my first trip up the Espiritu , as I wrote before , I left Andy behind in Remate de Males , in case something went wrong , but now that Martin is here and the contact is made , we have decided to take the girls in with us , and Billy Quarrier , too , as there is no mission school this side of Cochabamba , in Bolivia . " Let not your heart be troubled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We surely thank the Lord for His new outboard motor , that He entered into your hearts and made you generous : But my God shall supply all your heed according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus ( Phil . 4:19 ) .

We are headed straight for I lell ! " Before we are through , we hope to have an airplane survey , so that we may hunt out the last lost soul in this great wilderness . Not one will escape the great net of our Lord ! For some have not the knowledge of God : I speak this to your shame ( I Cor. 15:34 ) . " The Lord has again impressed on us the great importance of the Niaruna work being built of God . The Lord willing , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all your prayers for the souls of the Niaruna and the work of His servants have been heeded . " Yours for a greater harvest of souls in the days ahead , " LES HUBEN , Madre de Dios " After reading his letter aloud , Leslie led them in a hymn . The two couples were seated facing one another on the twin beds in the Hubens ' room , where the arrival of the Quarriers had been celebrated with orange drinks called gaseosas and informal prayer . Now Leslie cried out gleefully , " If you think this is bad , folks , wait till you see Remate . Why , Madre is a paradise along- side of Remate . " Remate de Males , farther upriver , was the nearest trading post to the new mission . " It 's like going , " Huben said , " from Purgatory straight to Hell . " " My land ! " Hazel said . When her husband glanced at her uneasily , she smiled a tremendous party smile at Andy Huben . Andy Huben , smiling back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass . " Welcome to Madre de Dios , " she said . Andy Huben 's voice was one of the loveliest that Martin had ever heard , low and gentle and a little hesitant , a little sad even , yet at the same time clear and peaceful ; it had a quality of childlike wonder . With that look of surprise and the two neat buckteeth that just touched her lower lip , she reminded him slightly of an Easter rabbit ; her clear face combined an air of innocence with something as saucy and irreverent as a hot cross bun . " As I wrote in my last epistle , " Leslie said , " the Lord surely gave us the command to Go when He sent down the Mart Quarrier Family . " " Well , the Mart Quarriers are here , and they mean business ! " Hazel cried , with a wild look of suppressed laughter . When Martin tried to smile , Andy smiled also , slipping her hand through her husband 's arm . " We 're awful glad you Mart Quarriers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her awareness of their joke . " Not that Mart here and I are going to see eye to eye on every little thing ! " Leslie slapped Quarrier on the knee . " But maybe until you kind of get the feel of things , Mart , maybe you 'd better talk to me before you say anything like you did to the Comandante . " Hazel said , " Oh Martin , we just got here . " Andy Huben said , " Mr. Quarrier was in the right . " " Are you sure you know what we 're talking about , Andy ? And anyway , use Mart 's first name ; we 're all going to have quite a beautiful Christian fellowship before we 're through . " " Perhaps I was mistaken , " Quarrier muttered . He explained to Hazel what he had learned from Huben : that the Comandante had become increasingly impatient about the Niaruna , due  | to pressure put upon him from the capital to establish colonies and develop a lumber commerce in their lands , and to consolidate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been patient to a fault with the missionaries ' attempts to make peaceful contact with the tribe , but since no real progress had been made , stronger measures had become necessary . The Niaruna themselves had forced his hand , he said , with their raids upon the peaceful ' Piro and on the settlement at Remate de Males . " Now you have to admit , Martin , " Huben said , " that Rufino is in a tough position with the government . And just remember that without his good will no Protestant mission would be allowed to work here . After all " ? he turned to Hazel ? " Rufino is a Catholic . " " My goodness , " 1 lazel said , " a Catholic ! Imagine a Catholic helping out in the Lord 's work ! " " I-le 's a very practical Catholic , " Andy Huben remarked . " He thought that Leslie might open up that country faster than Padre Xantes , who is getting old and has no help . " " Then he 's a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know which is worse , a bad Catholic or a good one ! " Leslie Huben laughed with the rest , but at the first opportunity he said , " Whatever he is , he 's on our side . I worked hard to get him there , and I intend to keep him there . " " Oh Martin , really , " Hazel said , " why do n't you listen to Mr. Huben ? " " Leslie , " Leslie said . " ? listen to Leslie ! " It seemed to her that his beard made Leslie look rather naive . She smiled unhappily toward the Hubens , taking Martin 's arm . " He 's such a stubborn man , " she smiled . " Yet you say , Mrs. . . . Andy . . . that he was in the right . " " He can be morally in the right , " Andy Huben said mildly , " and still be mistaken . " " Oh , I do n't understand how that can be , I 'm sure ! " Hazel lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forgive her for her old-fashioned notions . " Well , you  | ca n't teach an old dog to suck eggs , " she told them . Martin broke in to remind her that she did not even know what he had done . He told her that he had encountered the Comandante in the afternoon , and after an elaborate exchange of civilities had suggested to Guzman that an armed attack on savages , except in self-defense , was against the national law . The Comandante had taken this reminder as a threat and had become angry . Hazel Quarrier groaned , and Huben shrugged hopelessly , trying to smile . " What a fellow ! " he said . " He has n't been here a single day , and he knows the law better than the Comandante ! " " It 's a well-known law , " Quarrier said . " They even mention it in the tourist literature . " " One of the first things you 'll have to learn , Martin , " Huben said , " is that here in the jungle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was pacing around the room . " Why , slavery is against the law , and half the people in this town are slaves ! The good Lord knows that slavery is an abomination in my sight , but the fact is that slavery is very difficult to control when the Indians themselves practice it , not only with their captives , but by selling their own children to other tribes . Why , Martin , there 's hardly an Indian in this settlement who is n't enslaved by somebody ! " " And Guzman ? " " What about him ? " " Your Mintipos say he profits from the slave trade . " " Do you have proof ? " Huben placed his fingertips together . " Now you be careful , Martin . If we do n't have Rufino 's cooperation we 're going to be in trouble . " " If we condone human slavery , we 'll be in worse trouble still . " Huben shrugged him off . " Look . There 's a law here against holding an Indian to any debt he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a local joke . When you told Guzman he is breaking the law , I 'm surprised he did n't laugh in your face ! The Comandante is the law here in the jungle , he takes the place of God Himself ! " Hazel gasped . " Really , Mr. . . . Leslie , " she began . " You do have a free-and-easy ? "  | Quarrier grasped her firmly by the arm and she subsided . " Then what did he mean , " he said to Huben , " when he said he had no intention of breaking the national law ? " " I know exactly what he meant , " Huben said . He paused . " He has an old army plane out at the airstrip , but it does n't work , and its pilot has been transferred . He ca n't call in another one without drawing attention to what he wants to do . " " There were two planes at the strip , " Quarrier said . " That 's right , " Iluhen sat down again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane ? " He jerked his thumb , then narrowed his eyes and lowered his voice . " Two Americans . ' rho , ' live right down the hall . They turned up about ten days ago , before we came up from Remate , and Andy says she thinks one of ' cm Wright be pretty notorious ; he looks like some feller that had his picture in the paper back home ! " Leslie smashed his list into his palm . " Anyway , they 're the blackest kind of sinners  --  drunkards , fornicators , killers . Yes , they 're killers , mercenary killers , no better than those who nailed our Lord upon His cross ! " " Jumping Jchosophat ! " Hazel cried , placing her hand on her check ; she winked at him in full view of Andy Huben . He knew that she was punishing him because Andy was pretty , and he tried to distract attention from her . He said , " Where did they come from ? " " Bolivia , I think . There 's been another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Guzman  --  this is just the chance he 's been waiting for . " " But somebody will report this ! " Quarrier said . " Who will ? Nobody will . And even if they did , they would not be believed . And even if they were believed , Guzman might be embarrassed , but his action would be approved . I tell you , Martin , the government wants those lands developed . So who 's going to report him ? Nobody will . Nobody gets in that man 's way ! " " Martin will , " Hazel said . " Wo n't you , Martin ? " Her tone was so cold , her voice so very different from the flustered voice of a moment before , that the Hubens stared at her .  | " I do n't know yet , " Martin said . " Why , I saw those men this morning , in the street ! " Hazel acted flustered once again . " And they 're even more black-hearted than you say they are ! " IN an early light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set forth with Billy to look at Indians in the market place , or to walk the river bank , keeping a sharp eye out for jaguars and anacondas , or to take a boat across the river to the jungle on the far side . There was so much to do . Yet in the end nothing happened ; they never found what they were seeking . Even Billy tired quickly once the sun had leaped clear of the trees ; the sun grew swollen , lost its outline , turning the sky from limpid blue to dull cooked white , like a gigantic frying egg , until the sun itself turned a sick white , in a white sky . Though it was still early in the morning , they would retreat into the Gran Hotel , with its slow creak of ceiling fans and dusty purr of frazzled chickens in the kitchen court . In the bar of the hotel , the people sat all day waiting for rain to cool the air , and when the rain came , every afternoon , they waited for it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did their sitting in their rooms . They were waiting for supplies to come , and meanwhile they sweated like the damned , and sipped on orange gaseosas and prayed prayers . For three days now , in time of worship , Andy 's right knee and his left had touched , and he was straining to touch knees again when the brutal shout of the gross bearded outlaw pierced the thin ceiling from the bar below ; all four stared at one another , tense with dismay . Only the moment before , Leslie Huben had said , " . . . and we pray for the Niaruna , 0 Lord , that they may come to know Thy great love and the blessings of a Christian life in Thy sight and the joy of the hereafter in Heaven above ? " " ? and blow them little brown pricks to Kingdom Come ? " " Amen . " Leslie , startled , concluded his prayer by mistake . In the silence Martin thought , Can God be laughing at us ?  | He really meant , laughing at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasped the juxtaposition of Heaven and Kingdom Come , nor even the obscenity , but only the dreadful callousness of that man 's exclamation mounting from the lower regions . It was left to him , Martin Quarricr , to see the lurid irony of the timing . Why had he seen it ? And why  --  since the event was circumstantial , after all  --  had his first thought been that God was laughing ? Or had the lord intended that hellish cry to draw his attention to his own behavior ; for an instant his leg had actually been pressed to hers , because Andy had swung half about , and gazing straight through hint , blind to his confusion , said , " May God have mercy on his soul . " " Amen , " her husband said again . " No , " l lazel said . She had started up like a goaded beast , then sank hack heavily once more , her shoulders slumped , her ears protruding through her hair ; her bun , ordinarily immaculate , had collapsed since their arrival , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had once found in the barn . " Sometimes we ask too much of ! lint . Our God is a just God , and He will strike down such iniquity with His terrible swift sword ! " " On Judgment I ) av , perhaps , " Quarrier said . He rose and went to the window . In his guilt he did not wish to look at Hazel , who wore high sneakers and a big print dress with hearts and bright red roses on a shiny background ; his guilt made him feel irritable . Huhcn jumped up and walked the room , up and down , his eyes upon the floor . " I 'll he franker than I was the other day , Martin . If the Niaruna can be cowed a little , they will be softened up for an outreach of the Word , and this will make our work  --  yes , your work too , Martin , do n't look at me like that  --  a darn sight easier . Do n't you forget that the Opposition is just lying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won in Jesus ' name . " Quarrier said , " It is our responsibility to try to stop him ? " " It is not your responsibility . It is my responsibility . "  | " Yet you do n't accept it . " " I beg your pardon . " Huben stopped short in his pacing . " Now you be careful , fella . We have other people working with the Tiro and Mintipo in this area , and I ca n't , I wo n't jeopardize those fellows for your sake ? " " I certainly understand that you ca n't jeopardize the other missions , so what I 'm after here is permission to talk to Guzman again on my own responsibility ? " " No , " Huben said . " You 've caused enough trouble already . I 'm sorry , Martin , but I forbid this . " " I 'll talk to the Americans then . " Huben shrugged . " Go ahead . You 'll get nothing but jeers from men like those . " " They are devils , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hairy one  --  he could pass for a devil himself ! And that other one  --  I 've never seen a face like that in all my born days . That man has looked Satan straight in the eye ! " " I do n't know , " Andy said slowly . She had moved across to Hazel , who had never once lifted her eyes from the hands clenched in her lap , and now she put her arm around Hazel 's shoulders . " That second man , I saw him in the corridor . Maybe Martin could talk to that second man . " " Yes , I 'll try . " Quarrier turned his gaze from Leslie to Andy . " What does he look like ? " " You must have seen him in the hall . In a strange way , quite an interesting face . Dark , a little hard . Indian blood . And he always wears a dark blue neckerchief round his throat . " " What makes you think he 's Indian ? " " Oh Andy ! " Leslie snorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow comes from up our way . He looks more like some kind of an Italian to me . " " I know he 's an Indian ; he 's part Cheyenne . " Andy got up and walked about the room . " I knew I 'd seen that face before , and when I learned that his name was Moon , I was certain of it . " She turned and looked at her husband . " He 's from our mission schools , somewhere up in the Northwest . " " That hairy one ? " Hazel , distracted , was gazing out the  | window after Billy , who was playing in the streets . " That hairy one never came from our Sioux mission , I 'll tell you that much ! " " No , no , the other man . " " Andy , honey , just because this fellow looks a little In-dian ? " " I told you , he 's part Cheyenne or something ; anyway , he 's from the reservations . And he was bright , and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so they decided to make an example of him , do n't you remember ? Years ago . He was the first Indian from the missions to go to the state university  --  Somebody Moon . " There was a lot of talk about it . I remember , because my dad was all excited . " " But you were only a child ! " said Leslie , frowning . " Yes . I was only a child , but I cut his picture out of the paper and even kept it in my room . I felt sorry for him , I do n't know why . I mean , I guess I felt sorry for all Indians , the way we treated them . And especially the Cheyennes  --  the first time I read about that journey from that Oklahoma reservation , all the way north across Kansas and Nebraska and South Dakota and on into Montana , and getting shot down by those stupid , stupid people just because they wanted to go home , I cried all night  --  it makes me cry right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had risen to her eyes . " So anyway , I prayed for him . " " Dull Knife 's people , " Quarrier said . " Martin knows all about Indians , " Hazel said in a flat voice . It seemed to her that her husband , in the past years at the Sioux mission , had grown more and more indecisive , masking a loss of evangelical zeal with his " respect " for the Indian culture ; how was he ever to redeem a people whose religion seemed to him so beautiful ? It was her theory that his fascination with the tribal sacraments , the respect he paid them , not only impeded the harvest of souls but was downright disrespectful to the Lord . Martin claimed that his gradual methods laid a better foundation for true faith than quick conversion , but his dogged adherence to these methods was the sin of pride . " Well , a lot of my mother 's people were massacred by Sioux in Minnesota , so our family is n't quite so sentimental as Andy 's  | is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got his picture in the paper for going to the university ? " " Well , yes . And again for being thrown out of it , just before graduation . A lot of folks hollered , Darn drunken Injuns ! ' but they were pleased it happened . And then a third time when he was sentenced . Only he never came home again  --  they never caught him . " " A criminal ! " cried Hazel , who had never seen one . " I might have known ! And a backslider , at that ! " When her husband smiled , she immediately looked cross ; this was a rule of her game . " Well , it was n't all that simple . " Andy seemed sorry that she had brought it up . " I think I do remember , " Quarrier said . " Somebody Moon . I certainly do remember . He assaulted somebody , stole his money ? do n't you remember , Leslie ? It was in all the mission newsletters for months . " He rose and started for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leslie said , " I had not been called by Jesus . Anyway , it just goes to show you what you 're up against . A man like that will only mock you . " " Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers , " Hazel intoned as her husband went out , " for what fellowship bath righteousness with unrighteousness ? " And what communion hath light with darkness . II Corinthians , Martin thought as he went down the stairs . He had never dealt with this aspect of his work , the hostility and jeering , the contempt . How strange that the contempt should be so frightening  --  as frightening , yes , as the danger from the savages ... Well ... He drove himself along the corridor , determined not to reconnoiter but to make a firm entry and demand an audience . In the door to the bar he collided with Padre Xantes . The priest smelled of liquor but was otherwise composed . " Good evening , sir , " he said to Quarrier . " You are looking for the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quarrier grinned , frowned , said " Excuse me , " said " Good evening , " and finally in a fit of nervousness and impatience ex- tended his hand , which the padre took , and to his dismay , did not release . They struggled silently in the passage . " Why do you hate and fear us so , " the padre said , " when all we feel towards you is mild astonishment ? " Still smiling , Quarrier thrashed politely , desperate to free himself . This is absurd , he raged ; why does he cling to me ? Over the padre 's shoulder he saw Huben 's convert , Uyuyu , who skulked past them , hissing , " Buenas . Buenas noches . " The padre said , " Si , si , poor Uyuyu . Such a promising boy ! " He gasped for breath , but still he clung to Quarrier like a blind man . " Si , I raised hint ntvself in the mission , raised him a pure catolico , and now he is  --  eh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over ? A Protestant ? I ) o von believe so ? Is he neither ? Is he both ? " The padre stopped smiling ; he gripped Quarrier 's hand in his bony fingers . " Answer me , Senor Quarrier . Do you think he knows the difference ? " Later Quarrier wondered at that last remark ; did the priest not mean , " Do you think Ile knows the difference ? " How false and cynical , if true  --  did it betray a papist lack of faith in their own dogma ? I lc should not have talked to the priest at all . Just at that moment he broke loose  --  or rather , the padre threw his hand away , casting it up into the air as if setting free a dove .  | WOLFIE WORE HABITUALLY , EVEN AT NIGHT , A BLACK BERET , OUTsized dark glasses , the green fatigues of one or more foreign armies , and a gold earring in his left ear . He had been talking loudly when he lost his footing in the slime and fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid-air and while still on his hands and knees , as if nothing were amiss . He was still speaking as he rose . He was a broad squat powerful man , with big loose hands and a big shaggy head , a chest like a nail keg , and small feet , and he was tightly sprung ; one had the impression that Wolfie , fitted out with rubber soles , could bound five feet straight up into the air from a standing position . " How come he wants to see us ! " Wolfie shouted ; they had been summoned by a soldier to an audience with El Comandante . " There ai n't enough bread to pay this Guzman , anyway ! " When Moon did not answer , Wolfie said , " Look , we got thirtyfour pesos and we was into him for more than that ten days ago . And I ai n't goin to no calabozo , never again , not in this town  | and not on this whole lousy continent . I 'm very particular about the pens I go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember down in Paraguay ? Like , that food , man . Are you kiddin ? That 's food ? And also those arc very unhygienic conditions , not to mention stink . It stinks in there worse than it stinks out here . " He drew in a violent breath of the sweet jungle night . " Phoo ! " he said . " This jungle ! Ilow can you stand it  --  you depraved or what ? I mean , this is where God farted . " " It smells to me like the night was full of flowers . " " Oh man , " Wolfie said . " Flowers . Flowers , he says . Oh man . " I le walked on a little way . " Lissen . I am very serious , " he resumed . " I do n't dig this jungle scene . I wan na split , and we ai n't got bread enough to gas up the lousy aircraft . I am being very serious with you . If there ai n't a solution around here pretty fast , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And when you showed him them river diamonds , he told you they looked phony . " " All diamonds are white , says the Comandante . " " I tell vou what I think . I think this Guzman , he 's gon na hang in there a little more and then he 's gon na grab the aircraft . " " That 's what I think too . " " Well , we ai n't gon na take the screwin lyin down . " " We 'll have to take it standing up then . " " Yeah , yeah , so all right . So I 'm gon na send a letter to the American ambassador and sign it An Outraged Citizen . ' What do you say to that ? " Wolfie shadowboxed , punching and snorting in the open street , but almost immediately gave it up . " Okay , never mind , do n't talk to mc , I forgot Cuba . So we lost our citizenship ? that was my fault ? " Ile shook his head and sighed , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Wandering Jew . Only why in Christ did we wander into this place for  --  it was n't funky enough in all them other jungles ? Why do n't we ever wander along the Riviera , maybe ? La dol-ce vita , right , Lewis ?

I took my bar mizvah and I never ate goy dreck , and I was goin to  | be , like , a Talmudic scholar . And now I 'm the Man without a Country . There ai n't no justice , right , Lewis ? " He grinned . " I got an idea , Lewis . If we go to the calabozo , we might as well go there flat , because they 'll grab the thirty-four anyway . So first we 're gon na go back to La Concepcion , Lewis , and have a little drunk for ourselves , all right , Lewis ? . . . I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Moon said . THE Gran Hotel Dolores was a structure of twelve rooms ; except for the church and mission of the Iglesia de la Virgen , it was the largest building in the settlement , and the only one besides the sawmill which was roofed with tin instead of thatch . The hotel had been erected in the great era of the rubber boom , in anticipation of a prosperity that came but did not remain ; it gave shelter to transient timbermen and plantation patrones , to explorers investigating the wild tribes and rivers of Oriente State , and to missionaries , as well as to such rare visitors as the state 's political representatives in the capital . The hotel bar , which occupied one flank of the whitewashed lobby  --  dining-room  --  salon , was the center of Madre de Dios , for the rest of the settlement , unequipped with generators , was plunged into darkness by the jungle night . Hence the people were drawn like insects to its light . Those with money and those who had spent money at the Gran Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered on the sidewalks , content with the glow from the large windows in the white plaster wall . Here , as the evening passed , they might speak softly or sing ; the townsmen at the tables inside sang rarely and spoke loudly . Having neither glass nor screen but only large wooden shutters to be closed in time of storm , the windows were used periodically for sudden entry and exit . The bar was located on a corner , and since its two doorways serviced each of the only two streets in town , the clientele commanded a view of almost everything of importance that took place in Madre de Dios . A further attraction of the Gran Hotel was a radio that played full blast all day and night , as if  --  since all jungle radios  | were overpriced  --  its listeners were entitled at the very least to all the volume it was able to deliver . The radios were cheaply made , and since it was never certain that , once silenced , one would ever speak again , and since there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual practice was to turn it on immediately upon purchase and leave it on for the rest of its natural life . Once dead , it remained in its place of honor forever : a mute radio , all set about with Spanish doilies , artificial flowers and a hand-tinted portrait of the Virgin Mary , was in Madre de Dios a symbol of prestige . Behind the bar of the Gran Hotel two dead radios flanked the live one . These were but a few of the unusual features which made the bar of the ( ; ran 1 hotel Dolores the heart of this jungle capital , and it was to this place that there came each night , in a private car with a soldier-driver , its proud owner , El Comandante Rufino Guzman . Since no road in Madre de Dios went farther than the airstrip , the car , brought in by lumber raft , was used almost exclusively to conduct ill Comandante between his house at the army post and the hotel . I  --  I Comandante invariably sat himself behind a table in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan . Here his townsmen could come to him as to the Judgment Scat , and here he could witness and preside over almost everything that took place , not only in the bar itself , but in his entire kingdom . On this February evening one of the two Americans who had sat down with Guzman stood up almost immediately and walked about the room ; he returned to the table but did not sit down again . In the two weeks since their arrival in Madre de Dios , Moon and Wolfie had put on a bold face , ordering the best that the Gran Hotel Dolores had to offer , but the Comandante had not been taken in , and now he was baiting them at his leisure . Collecting their passports that first day , he had grinned in a way that had alerted them to the dimension of their predicament , saying , " Of course the senores pilotos are very welcome in my humble city ; it is only a formality , and soon the pasaportes will be returned . " Wolfie , thinking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jerking his thumb at Moon , " Amigo mio him also  | heap big indio ! " The Comandante , who was not an indio , had gazed briefly at Moon , a gaze that made Moon coil and stiffen ; he had not returned the papers , and meanwhile their bill at his hotel had mounted remorselessly . Now he pointed at Moon 's chair , as if Moon , standing , made him nervous . Moon remained standing , hands in pockets . The Comandante took note of this small rebellion ; he lifted the glass , poured the liquor down his throat like a man filling a hole , and blew the air back out at Moon in a huge belch , as if to send him flying from his sight . The people in the bar sniggered expectantly , nudging one another . They watched the Comandante wipe his mouth with the back of one hand and with the other signal for another drink . Over the back of the wiping hand , which he held for a long time at his mouth , his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Ha , ha , ha , ha . " " This is some terrible kind of a jungle beast , " Wolfie observed , sincerely impressed ; he hitched forward in his chair to stare more closely at the Comandante . In this place , all but isolated from the world , the big pale man beneath the fan was the natural enemy , and their enmity was an old one ; Moon reacted to his gaze with the clutched fear and hatred that he had once felt for the county sheriff . Though he kept his expression blank and casual , it was all he could do to face him . They had met on all the earth 's frontiers , in all its jungles ; this was the strongman unrestrained , the incensed executor of his own law , swollen and jovial with power . The Comandante was a massive man , quite unlike the small brown halfbreeds of his town , a big thick man with a pale thick unshaven face . He had a coarse small crown of hair , more like a tuft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Wolfie had boasted of Moon 's Indian blood , the Comandante had called Moon piloto with heavy sarcasm , in a way which suggested that Moon 's status as senor piloto was a tremendous joke . So intent was Guzman on conveying disdain for Moon that he addressed all his remarks to Wolfie , even though Wolfie spoke almost no Span- ish . In this way Moon was made to serve the white caballeros as interpreter . Wolfie was quite oblivious of this situation , and for the moment it amused Moon to pretend that he was oblivious of it also . " How long do you plan to be our guest in Madre de Dios then ? " the Comandante said to Wolfie . " Bueno , " Wollic said . " Right , Lewis ? " Behind his hand he said loudly , " I 'm just kind of stringin this beast along . " " We will leave when you return our passports , " Moon said , after a moment . The United States had revoked their passports in absentia ; there was no sign on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will be delighted to return the passport of the caballero " ? Caiman bowed to Wolfie ? " when the caballero regulates his accounts at the hotel . I am an understanding man . I do not even ask you why you have no visa for this country , or impure where you have come from . On the other hand , I am not stupid . Your airplane is full of armaments . It has bullet holes in its wings . I know where you have come from . And I also know that if I send you back there . . . " He smiled broadly . " You chose the wrong side , no ? " " Caramba ! " Wolfie said , judicious . " How 'm I doin , Lewis ? " Moon said , " We have no money , and apparently there is no work we can do here . " The Comandantc nodded . " I much regret it , of course , but even if there was work that you could do , I am not empowered to issue work permits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You own the hotel , you own this town . We are living at your expense ; therefore we figure you have something in mind . " The Comandante sighed . " If you can not regulate your accounts in a very short time , you will force me to confiscate your property . " " The airplane . " " The airplane . Precisely . " " And you know what the plane is worth . " Guzman grinned . " As a matter of fact , I do . I have made inquiries . "  | " We are American citizens . Suppose we complain to our ambassador ? " Guzman grinned still wider , a grin that shot straight back along his jaw without curling upward . " I beg of you , " he said , " please do so . Your embassy will advance you funds and you may regulate your accounts , no ? " His tone changed , and for the first time he spoke to Moon directly . " I have been waiting for you to do this , photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When Moon was silent , he continued , " Because you do not wish to do it . Because you are fugitives , perhaps , or criminals . " He banged both hands flat upon the table . " All the more reason why I must protect my country ! " He waved his hand toward the door , dismissing them . " I will give you three more days , " he bawled , and jammed his face into his glass again , surfacing a moment later with a blast of air . " Hey , momentito , " Wolfie said . " Hey , Lewis , remember what we heard about them Indians ? " " Guzman , " Moon said . The man whirled on him . " Mestizo ! You will call me Comandante Guzman ! " he shouted . " Be very careful ! I can send you back where you have come from , do you understand ? And there you will be shot ! " Moon was listening to his partner , his face expressionless . Then he said to Guzman , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Eh ? " Guzman placed his fingertips on the table , as if about to spring . " What is it ? " " The Niaruna are still not pacified , and the news is getting out , and yet your hands are tied because the law prohibits you from sending your soldiers in to kill the Indians . " Guzman nodded , looking carefully at Moon . " I am quite able to take care of our poor Indians . " " We were just thinking that a foreign plane loaded with armaments . . . ? On its way elsewhere . . . ? " Guzman kept on nodding . " Claro , " he said . " Si . Claro. "  | LATER , on their beds upstairs , they discussed it further . They were both irritable , Wolfie because he felt Moon had not really told him what had been decided with the Comandante , and Moon because he did not want to think or talk at all . He lay on his back and stared at a huge moth pasted on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ai n't as stupid as I look , so level with me . Something happened there right at the end , I seen his face . " He heaved over on his side . " That bastard 's got a plan he did n't have before , now ai n't that right ? He kinda likes the Old Wolf 's idea about goin out and leanin on them poor motherin Indians we heard about , the ones that 's buggin him out to the east . Right ? " Moon was silent . " Oh that murderin bastard , " Wolfie said . " Like , shame on 'm . " After a while he said , " Listen , Lewis , I do n't blame you , not wantin no part of this . I do n't blame you , only did you stop and think , if we do n't do it , somebody else 's goin to , and if we do do it , we do n't have to make no direct hits , just maybe like a little napalm upwind , know what I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Urn . " " Well , there 's always the diamonds , Lewis . " " Yeah . " " These greasers run a lousy jail , Lewis , and how about the aircraft ? And also , these Neo-rooneys ai n't real Indians , Lewis . They ai n't like Blackfoots or Apaches or Cheyennes or nothin . They 're just a bunch of starvin jungle rats , just like you told me . This is South America , remember ? It ai n't like they was your own people or nothin . So maybe you could kind of think of it like a mercy killin , huh , Lewis ? " Wolfie cocked his hip and cheerfully broke wind . " I said , huh , Lewis ? You ai n't startin to go soft on me , I hope ? " Moon was staring at the moth so hard that it blurred and became two . He was still irritable when Uyuyu knocked on the door ; he snapped it open , and the Indian leaped back toward the stairwell . In the cheap red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's neck looked thin , and his face twitched in his attempts to smile . This Indian happened to have a bright red shirt with bright blue rockets on it , but otherwise he was identical to his counterpart in every frontier river town from Puerto Maldonado in Peru to Porto Velho in Brazil , from Riberalta in Bolivia to Bahia Negra down in Paraguay : the native with the bright smile and the Christian humility , the sharp eye and the crucifix . Moon demanded , " Did you bring it ? " He did not know which gave him most shame  --  the stupor of the Indian defeated by the white man , or the hunger of the convert like Uyuyu , with his base imitations of the white man 's way . Another door opened down the corridor , and a girl appeared in a shaft of light . She closed her door and came toward them . Uyuyu tried to slip past Moon into the room . Perversely , Moon deterred him . Uyuyu was still pushing gently as the girl approached the stairs . She greeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled inquiringly at his discomfiture . Glancing at Moon , she nodded politely , then looked carefully again . She was a small girl with straight brown hair to her shoulders and a clear open face , sunburned , in hide sandals and a dress of pale blue faded linen . Moon had noted her nice legs while waiting to see her face , but it was the face that struck him . The skin was warm and clear and the mouth full  --  the line of the upper lip was a soft arch and white teeth touched her lower lip in a wistful way . So certain was he that she smelled good that his belly glowed and tingled , and at the same time he was overwhelmed by nostalgia for something lost . Frantic , he cleared his throat . She was turning toward the stairs . " I do n't guess we 've met before , " he said . She gazed directly into his face . " No , " she said , " no , we have n't . " She went on downstairs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian was prepared to speak of her with reverence or obscenity , according to the whim of his new master , but Moon only scowled at him and sent him off ; Uyuyu was to seek out his friend , the ayahuascero , and bring Moon a fresh bottle of the drug by the next evening . Moon went back into the room . Wolfie lay flat out on his  | bed , his beret propped on his huge dark glasses , his gold earring on the pillow , snoring . At the rust-flecked mirror on the flyspecked sink Moon curled his lip at what she must have seen . Once , at a police hearing , he had heard a tape of his own voice , and the sound had seemed just as foreign to him as the face which now confronted him : a lean face , yellow-bronzed with sunburn and malaria , carved close around high cheekbones and an Indian 's broad mouth , a weathered face , so set in its expression that the dark eyes scented to burn through a leather mask . The face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid as a helmet ? a bad head , he thought , a dirty head , as the French say . It looked too big for the body , though the body was strong and quick enough  --  - or had been before he had worn it out with lush and tail and junk , and now malaria . Well , he was scarcely a pat-fit gentil knight ; as Wolfie said , he looked like some Hollywood ( ; croninto trying to kick a ninety-dollar habit . Moon toppled backward over the end of his own bed and blew a long sigh at the ceiling . Wolfie was sighing , too . " I 've had a hard-on for three days now , " Wolfie said . " You think I ought to consult my physician ? " And they lay there laughing for a long time , Wolfie hiccuping for joy , while the vultures circled in the dull gray sky beyond the window , crisscrossing the black crest of jungle , and the enormous moth on the ceiling gazed down upon them with the white eyes on its wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both feet down hard on the floor between the beds.  | ON THEIR WAY DOWNSTAIRS THEY WERE INTERCEPTED BY THE Comandante , who bought them a drink . Moon emptied his glass and banged it down on the table between himself and Guzman , contemplating his host until the latter , caught by the sound in mid-pontification , withheld a frown , smiled that long smile that seemed to move straight back instead of moving upward , and asked Senor Wolfie if he and his . . . friend ? . . . would not have another . Moon raised his eyebrows , shifting his gaze to a fourth man who had joined them at the table . " I would be happy to join you , " the priest said in English ; he had come in late . He smiled , affecting innocence of the Comandante 's irritation , and bowed almost imperceptibly to Moon . He was a small spare figure with a shrewd frugal face and stiff white hair standing straight up on his head , and this evening , despite the heat , he wore his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More drinks came , and still more drinks , and the Comandante paused briefly in his discourse to display soiled photos of  | his forlorn fat wife , taken head on , at attention  --  Senora Dolores Estella Carmen Maria Cruz y Peralta Guzman , he proclaimed ? and of his son Fausto , whose head at this moment was just visible behind the bar . El Comandante did not dispense salaries to strangers . " The Indians , in my heart I love them , they are my brothers , but this great land must he made safe for progress . . . " Guzman had already made his point obliquely , confidentially , demanding and eliciting an occasional " Si , claro " from Moon and from the padre ; swollen with drink , he was now prepared to start again . Even Wolfie , who had caught little or nothing of the address , sensed that they were in for a reprise . " Oh man , " he groaned , and rolled his eyes . ( : Teary , he felt that an interjection in another language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , by a drunken greaser . And it was true that in an access of selfhypnosis , Fl Comandante continued to speak with furrowed brow , his eyes shut tight in psychic pain ; he seemed oblivious of them all . " Los indios , quiero cltcir , los salvajes bravos ? " Wol ( e whistled . " Even him payin for the drinks , it still ai n't worth it . I mean you boil down all this gas he 's blowin which I do n't even understand a word of it , and what he still wants is that we swing out there and blast the crap out of the redskins , right ? " Moon nodded , and the padre 's smile flickered a moment , like a tic . " Jesus , why do n't he spit it out then ? " Wolfie said . Then he yelled , " Get your ass out there , boys , and blow them little brown pricks to Kingdom Come ! " The silence that followed caused all three to turn toward Guzman . He had stopped talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so huge and silent that it bathed the entire room in apprehension . The faces gathered swiftly in the windows . Wolfie nodded his head , impressed . " Look at them eyes , " he said . He kept on nodding . " Like he do n't understand a word I said and this jungle beast wants to massacre the poor old Wolf . "  | To Guzman he said , " What are you , some kind of an anti  --  Seemite ? " And he laughed into Guzman 's face , in honest delight . Moon caught a glint in Wolfie 's eyes which , coupled with the cheerful tone , meant that his partner wished to fight . And Guzman himself , who had also attained that plane of drunken perception on which all languages are understood , turned his gaze from Wolfie to Moon and , making no headway , to Padre Xantes ; the priest lowered his eyes , though calmly . " Bueno , " said Guzman ambiguously , and cleared his throat . The padre , chin on chest , nodded minutely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Comandante . " You got that , Duke ? So let 's cut out , let 's go get laid . " Jumping to his feet , he clapped Guzman on the shoulder ; Guzman 's hands dropped down below the table , and Moon 's own hand slid inside his shirt . " How about that , Stud ? Chicas ? Mujeres ? " The hands appeared again , first Guzman 's , then Lewis Moon 's , and were placed carefully on the table edge . Moon almost said , " He 's got a knife , " but watching Wolfie , he knew he did not have to . Guzman decided to smile . The smile slid back along his jaw , more like a split . " Gurls , " he said . " Woomans . " He laughed : " Ha , ha , ha , ha . " It occurred to Moon that Guzman was the only man he had ever heard who actually said " ha , ha , " when he laughed , heavily and separately like that : " Ha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he stared at Moon . " Indio , " he said . " Ha , ha , ha , ha . " Moon did not join them when they left . He sat quietly , facing the padre , and after a while the priest lifted his head and returned his gaze . " You think I am humiliated , do you not ? " the padre said . " Why do you care what I think ? " " You do n't answer my question . " " It 's not my problem , Padre . " " I am humiliated , of course . It is humiliating to have to sit here and listen to cold plans for taking life and know that one will not raise a hand to stop it . " " Why do you sit here then ? " Moon said . " I was told to come . Our Comandante intends to break the  | national law , which forbids the killing of Indians except in selfdefense . But as long as he compels the representative of the Church to give tacit agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame so thin that ? " " Yes , I guessed as much . I asked a stupid question . " " The question you intended to ask , senor , is how a priest such as myself , willing to sir here and drink with villains , may call himself a priest . But is he then to turn his back on the other tribes who need his help , to abandon the work that can be done , to do nothing but creep about an empty church ? For that is the alternative , should one contest the word of El Comandante . And so I must choose what scents to Inc the lesser of two sins , and pray for forgiveness in the eyes of the Lord . " The priest stood up . " I suggest , " he said , " that you and your colleague must do the same . " He bowed very slightly . " Buenas i/ochcs . " " Buenas nochcs , Padre . " Xantes hesitated . " What kind of men arc you ? Could I plead with you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be somebody else . " " That 's right . You 're not a stupid man , Padre . " " Quite true . I am the only man of  --  is it this word ? ? sensibility in the entire state of Oriente ; that makes me somebody , no ? " He paused . " And who are you , Mr. Moon ? Are you any-body ? " Moon looked at him ; he had been taken by surprise . " Me ? " he said . " Why , I am the great halfbreed of the world . " He paused and drank ; the priest awaited him . Moon seized a fold of his own skin . " The color of modern man ! In a few centuries everybody is going to look like Lewis Moon . " He burst out laughing . " You are not truly amused , " the padre told him coldly ; Moon stopped smiling . " You did not answer my question  --  who are you , Mr. Moon ? I did not ask what you were . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . " You are an educated man . In the times we have talked , I have found it entertaining . It is too bad we work against each other , no ? In a stupid world ? " He bowed .  | Moon rose drunkenly and returned the bow , lifting his glass , but the priest , in elegant distaste , paid him no heed . For all his drink , he was as ascetic and erect as he had been three hours before , though he had to shuffle now to keep his balance . Turning slowly at the door , he contemplated Moon for nearly a halfminute . " These Indians that you wish to kill . . . " A faint smile emerged on his face , and he nodded his head up and down , up and down . " Yet it appears that you are part Indian yourself , senor ? " Moon was silent . " How sad , " the padre sighed . " Does it not strike you as rather sad , senor ? " Then he was gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the appearance of Uyuyu , even though it was Uyuyu whom he awaited ; the very sight of that red shirt annoyed him . The Indian must have lurked outside until Xantes departed , not wishing the priest to learn of his business with Moon . And since Moon did not feel guilty , Uyuyu 's guilt annoyed him further . According to Xantes , Uyuyu had come to Madre de Dios in search of an education so that the Indians of the Remate de Males region would be less easily cheated by the traders . He had sold his service to the priest , who taught him to read and write , and he became a fanatic Christian : within the year , Xantes had made him the mission teacher at Remate . But when his Catholic prayers for his people went unheeded , Uyuyu had switched to the Protestant prayers of Leslie Huben . He had also applied his education to the exploitation of the very people he had set out to defend , and was now so little at ease with himself that as he approached Moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguishable . But he had brought it , a large wine bottle full of the thick brown fluid called ayahuasca , which he placed on the table , patted , and relinquished . " Uyuyu . Esta muy fresca , Uyuyu , no ? " " Muy fresca , sen " or  --  ayahuascero amigo mio . " The Indian backed out of the room . The distemper in his narrow face reminded Moon of James Mad Raven , one of the last full-bloods on the reservation . James Mad Raven had called the halfbreeds  | " white trash " because the halfbrceds , in recent years , had taken to calling James Mad Raven " nigger . " Up in Barbados lived a big brown nigger girl in a big plain dress with a round white collar . Moist-voiced and obscene , with a languorous warm tongue and a breath of candy , she had tried hard to evangelize hint , wagging an earnest finger with one hand while with the other she explored his lap under the table . She was an Anglican , very devout . " Mahn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone know Jesus if you wuh-shipin dat May-rv ? " It did not occur to her that someone who was not Anglican might not he Catholic either . When he said nothing , she had mourned a little . " In do day , you see , it be all right , but in de night , niahn ... " She sniffed painfully . " De single life , doss de way it go . " this big sweet girl took him home with her to a world of chickens and poinsettias . Now what tam you mus go , sweet honey . Coss when you go , you woan corn bock . In the morning , her little boy clung to him all the way to the bus back to the port , calling out jovfully to children who jeered him , " See mahn dcah ? Ile fath-ah to me ! " Wistaria , that was her name . Wistaria dancing naked in her cottage . Wistaria , who cried when he went away , was the only one he remembered . De single life , doss de way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a dim figure had moved into the corner of Moon 's consciousness . Turning his head very slightly , he saw a man poised in the doorway . It was a gringo ; in the remote corners of the world the short-sleeved flowered tourist shirt , the steel-rimmed glasses , khaki pants and bulldog shoes had become the uniform of earnest American enterprise . Moon recognized the man as the new missionary . His head was cropped too close , so that his white skull gleamed , and the red skin of his neck and jaw was riddled with old acne ; his face was bald with anxiety and tiresome small agonies . Coming up to the table , the missionary bumped nervously into a chair ; it screeched on the tile floor . " Buenas noches , senor , "  | he said . " Puedo sentarme ? " He sat down on the edge of the chair . Raising his eyes without raising his head , Moon contemplated him while he rubbed his ear , which was already numb with drink . After a moment he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I have , " the man exclaimed , flushing . " I mean ? " he stood up , knocking the chair backward . " I did n't mean ? " He restored the chair . " It turns out we 're both Americans ! Imagine ! I mean , the way you dress and all , someone could take you for ? " " ? a gook , a wog , a spic , a spade ? " " Excuse me ? No , a local fellow . Of the town . " " Because of my clothes , you mean . " " That 's right . " " And because I look like all these local halfbreeds , these mestizos . " " Well , yes , in a way , " the man said , gazing frankly at Moon 's face . " Look , I was just trying to get acquainted . I knew all along you were Mr. Moon . " " Well , I know who you are too , friend , and if you sat down here to save my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell I was a missionary ? " " Are you serious ? How do you tell a hunchback or an elephant ? " Moon whistled in derision . " I do n't understand why you 're so angry  --  I just got here ! " " All halfbreeds , as you must have heard , are violent and treacherous , especially when under the effects of alcohol . " The man laughed aloud , controlled himself , and sighed . " Personally , as an American , I 'd be very proud to have Indian blood . I think most Americans would be proud to have it . " " They would , huh ? " " I should think so . " " How much Indian blood would most Americans be proud to have ? " " Oh . " The man sighed again and shook his head . " But you 've done all right , it seems , " he said , unruffled . " Probably your education is better than my own . "  | " Probably . I 'm very well educated . " Moon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into this room just now , you not only knew my name was Moon but you knew that I was educated . You knew exactly who I was , is n't that right ? " The missionary tried to bluster , then waved his hands and groaned . " How did you know ? " Moon said . " It was just that Andy . . . Mrs. Huben . . . she remembered reading something . . . she was very sympathetic with your position . " " She was , huh ? Let me ask you another question . " " Why , certainly . " " How would you like a short kick in the nuts ? " The man stood up . " Sit down , " Moon said , taking his arm . " They say that Indians ca n't hold their firewater . " He grinned stupidly , and the man sat down . " Last quest ion , " Moon said . " How would you like me to marry your sister ? " Ile burst out laughing , leaning back in his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask you a question , " the man said . When Moon only shrugged , he said , " With that education and everything , how did you end up in Madre de Dios ? " " Why , I 'm a missionary , " Moon said . " I 'm at work in the fields of the Lord . Go ye into all the world , and preach the gospel to every creature . Mark , Chapter i6 , Verse 15 . You want to get preached to ? " The man looked angry but said nothing . " You do n't believe I 'm a missionary ? " " Of course not . " " Are you calling me a liar ? " The man said , " I deny your right to speak this way , even in jest , because you 're not a missionary . You are a vicious , drunken man , and a blasphemer . " He mopped his face , very upset . " The Niaruna you intend to murder are the ones I will be working with . I mean to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb them , machine-gun them ? "  | " It will make things hot for you , is that right ? " " I was n't thinking about that ? " " Better start right now , then . " " I 've thought about it . I have a wife and child . " " You have faith in the Lord , do n't you ? " " There are limits to what we can ask of the Lord 's mercy . " " Well , I never thought I 'd live to hear one of you fundamentalists admit that . Look , what are you hanging around for ? " Moon said . " Why did you sit down here in the first place ? " " When I say unto the wicked , Thou shalt surely die ; and thou givest him not warning , nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way , to save his life ; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity ; but his blood will I require at thine hand ! " " Okay , I 'm warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith then . " " Yes , I do . " " When you are out there in that forest , with the savages behind those trees  --  how much faith will you have then ? " " In God ? " " In your own faith . " The missionary began to speak ; he faltered and stopped short . " I 'll bet you 've asked yourself that very thing quite a few times . Let me ask you something else . Did you earn your faith , or were you stuffed with it , like a big turkey ? " " My faith is a question I 'll have to work out without your help . " The man got slowly to his feet . " I wanted to talk to you , Mr. Moon , but I see it 's impossible . Perhaps you could tell me where I could find your partner . " Moon picked up his glass and drank . " You want to see Wolfie , you 'll find him at the cat house . Only he hates being interrupted while he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can screw one of the pigs . " He finished his drink and stood up . The serenity in the missionary 's face incensed him ; yet he wondered if he really knew what he was angry at . Was it the distemper he felt whenever he had talked too much , or was it only  | that flat ugly voice of Western white America that to this day he could not hear without a twitch of shame and hatred ? One time , drunk , he had taunted his father for volunteering as a soldier in World War I , taunted him as a mongrel white . Alvin Moon had whipped him so badly that he had finally drawn a knife . They were in a saloon , the first and last time they ever had money enough to get drunk together . Alvin Moon told him to put down the knife , and he had done so without blustering . They returned to their bar stools and went right on drinking . After a while , when the onlookers had gone , Alvin Moon said , " That meanness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You tote that there meanness around with you just like you tote that big heavy oldtime war knife that the old men give you . There ai n't no real use for a knife like that no more . " To the nuissionary he said , " South Dakota ? Or Nebraska ? New " Tribes Mission ? Isar Tribes Mission ? Or S.I.L. ? " " North I ) akota . Tar " Tribes Mission . " He paused . " Well , Mr. Moon ? " " Lewis Moon . " 1 lc gave his hand . " Mv name is ullartin Quarrier . " " Well , Martin , you got the call , is that right ? " He closed his eyes , resting his face in his hands . " Care for some ayahuasca ? " " If that stuff 's ayahuasca , you better be careful . That 's a poisonous narcotic drug . The Indians call it nipi . Why , it gives you hallucinations ! It can kill you ! " " That 's right , " Moon said . " Care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms , and sighed . Without bringing his arms down he opened his eyes and looked at Quarrier . " What can I do for you ? " he said . " I 've heard what you men are going to do . I hoped you would tell me it 's not true . " " To tell a lie , " Moon told him , " is a sin . " Quarrier 's laugh , though genuine , trailed off into a squawk of desperation . Moon laughed too , in drunken glee . " This Indian , Uyuyu  --  Is it true that he 's working both sides of the street ? I mean , I was talking to the padre . Uyuyu 's a Protestant and a Catholic , is n't he ? "  | " Do you mean that Indian who was just here ? The one we call Yoyo ? " " Yeah  --  Yoyo . " Moon laughed softly , steadily . " That 's beautiful . " " Yes , he 's been both . " " What is he now , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frowned . " Forget it , man . " He waved Quarrier off , or rather , Quarrier 's expression . The steady stupid honesty of the man 's face annoyed him ; he felt somehow exposed . " Yoyo , " he muttered . " That 's beautiful . Who thought of that ? " " Andy  --  Mrs. Huben . Leslie 's wife . " " Oh yeah , the one who sympathizes with my position . So that 's Leslie 's , huh ? The pretty one . " Quarrier nodded , flushing . " Yours is the big girl , with black hair . " " Yes . " " You think Leslie 's little wife is pretty , too , I bet . " He studied Quarrier , then made a guess . " You think you 're in love with Leslie 's wife , is that right ? " Quarrier started to protest but was too upset to find his words . His face lost color . Moon heard his own voice say , " You screwed her yet ? " " You coward ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a child holds up two broken toys . Tears came from behind his glasses and rolled down his cheeks . " You have a demon . You 're a drunken coward ! " Moon laid his hands flat on the table . " I guess you could say that , all right , " he said . " I guess you could say that . " The rage had collapsed , subsiding in a sour self-dislike . His peaceful admission took the other man aback ; Quarrier stood there , fists still clenched , still crying , as if behind those heavy lenses his eyes had melted . " Your fists are clenched , " Moon observed quietly . " Well , come outside ! If you are man enough ! " The naivete of this jibe pained Moon worst of all ; in the excess of his spleen , he longed to slug this stupid-looking hick in his thick glasses , but he made himself say , " I am not man enough , "  | and not only that but  --  lest the missionary imagine that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And finally he said , " I 'm sorry . Please sit down . " " You mean you 're just going to sit there and let me call you a coward ? " " You 'll get tired of it after a while , " Moon said .  | WOLFIE AND GUZMAN WERE FIGHTING TO GET THROUGH THE DOOR together ; each dragged after him a giggling and frightened girl . Neither girl had left puberty far behind , and each had the small potbelly and high wide breasts , the flat face and delicate limbs of the jungle Indians . The pretty one wore her black hair pulled behind her ears , showing cheap earrings , and her bright red dress was tight ; when Guzman brought her to the table she winked at Lewis Moon , and slowly stuck her tongue out . " Se llama Suzie , " Guzman said . " Que. quieres aqui ? " he jeered at Quarrier . " Misionero ! Misionero want woo-mans ! " But when Quarrier glanced at the girl , then back at Guzman , the Comandante @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart . It was not to be thought , he assured the room at large , that the girl was for himself ; El Comandante Rufino Guzman , as the world well knew , was the honorable husband of the beautiful Senora Dolores Estella Carmen Maria Cruz y Peralta Guzman . The indio girl was for the North American mestizo , Senor  | Moon . At this Suzie giggled , stroking Guzman 's upper leg . She too was very drunk . " Ruff-ni-to , " she said , and winked at Moon again . But Moon and Guzman paid no attention to her . The Comandante was smiling triumphantly at Moon , and Moon smiled back at him until the Comandante , looking confused , stopped smiling and began to glare . Moon thought , Well , there 's going to be trouble . Any time now . Casually he checked Guzman 's hip ; the pistol belt was missing . At the bar Su  --  rie 's friend had broken loose from Wolfie , who was addressing her affectionately as Fat-Girl ; with his beard and beret , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark glasses , he had frightened her out of her wits . She had an open stupid face , with pockmarks and missing teeth , and was barefoot beneath her printed frock of mission gingham . Nevertheless , seeking to emulate her friend as well as to better her own lot , she addressed herself to the third gringo . Arms straight at her sides like a child reciting , she smiled and winked , stuck her tongue out very slowly , and said to Quarrier , " Ay yam Mercedes . Ay yam vir-geen . " " Ha , ha , ha , ha , " cried El Comandante Rufino Guzman . " Misioncro lull Indio gurls ! Ha , ha , ha , ha ! " Moon gazed solemnly at Guzman , then bent his head and began to laugh , and Wolfie , rushing up with his cigar and giant beer bottle , saw Moon laugh and began laughing too . He sat at the table , grabbed his Fat-Girl onto his knee and howled until the tears came , out of sheer empathy . After a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laughter rose and burst in high little sounds out of his nostrils : snee , snee , snee , snee . From along the bar and at the windows , beneath the display of hand-tinted Virgins and flamenco dancers on aguardiente calendars , soft-drink signs and plaster crucifixions , the laughter clattered without mercy . Sweet Suzie laughed straight into the face of Moon , her dark eyes mirthless , and fat Mercedes , who imagined that she was the mother of the joke , laughed modestly as best she could , for on Wolfie 's knee with both of Wolfie 's hands clasped hard upon  | her breasts , it was hard for a girl to get a breath . Moon recognized her as the girl who worked in Guzman 's kitchen . He smiled at her sympathetically , in response to which she winked at him again , and again stuck her tongue out . " Ha , ha , ha , ha , " shouted the Comandante , hurling himself backward ; he believed himself to be the witty one . " Snee , snee , snee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . Yet Guzman , surrounded by laughter , laughed alone ; and as for Wolfie , at no time during his entire seizure did he know or care what he was laughing at . " This is a madhouse , " Moon said approvingly to Quarrier , who looked like a man on whom the sky was falling . Suzie , following Moon 's gaze , leaned back and nestled her elbow in the missionary 's groin ; cocking her head far backward so that she stared straight up into his face , she cried out the identical words that Mercedes had spoken with such success a few minutes before . She kept her head that way for several moments , frowning when her remark was disregarded , and at the same time aware that something better was afoot : for Quarrier , who had jerked back from her elbow , was helplessly peering down into her dress . The girl raised her hands beneath her breasts until they swelled like buttocks in the neck of her dress , and said to Quarrier , " S-ss-t , s-ss-t , misionero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry . His sweating tormented head swung back and forth , back and forth . " What do you seek here ? " he said to Moon . " What are these lost souls laughing at ? " Moon took his wrist and pulled him down onto the bench beside him . " Be quiet , " he said , " you 're not here to save us . " But Quarrier persisted , waving his free arm about . " You are lost souls , ca n't you realize that ? You have Satan in you , every one of you ! " Moon squeezed his wrist so hard that the man faced him in surprise . " She 's got nice tits , " Moon said , " would n't you say ? " Quarrier opened his mouth , then closed it , reddening so violently that his whole face seemed to swell . Moon said to him , " Now listen , friend , you 're welcome here , but never mind the Gospel lessons . "  | But Wolfie , in violent antipathy to Quarrier , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says ! What are they laughin at ? " louder and louder ; then he reared up in his chair , shoving his FatGirl aside . " What are you , some kind of a religious fanatic or somethin ? You do n't like people enjoyin theirselves , or what ? " He smashed his fist on the table . " At least that Catholic , at least he 'd take a drink with us , for Christ sake ! Hey " ? he turned again to Moon ? " hey , Lewis , you remember them big spade girls we had in them rum-and-drums up in Barbados ? Did I ever tell you them whores was devout Catholics , for Christ sake  --  and Protestants ? And I bet every hunrpin one of them , Catholic and Protestant , had the clap . " Now what trait you inns go , sweet honey . Coss when you go , you woan corn bock . " I was in Barbados once , " Quarrier said . " On a freighter . We came down here by freighter from Fernandina , Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street and had ourselves a very nice chicken chow mein dinner . " Now that , thought Moon , makes two sad things that happened in Barbados . Wolfic winced . " Oh man , " he said . " Lissen . Where was I ? Oh yeah , I was gon na say , like where the hell do you get off tryin to tell us about sin ? That 's what you 're hangin around for , right ? " " Yes , " Quarrier said , and Moon watched Wolfie twitch under the steady gaze that the missionary fixed upon him . " Well , you got nothin to look so holy about , am I right , Lewis ? " When Moon said nothing , Wolfie turned back angrily to Quarrier . " You and them Catholics both . Some holy men ! All this lousy backbitin and knifin over people who maybe they do n't want no part of neither of you ; well , maybe you ought to think of that before you come sneakin around here criticizin ! Maybe them people are better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little human dignity , for Christ sake , and not where you bastards can make beggars out of them , not to mention all the booze and slavery and syphilis " ? Wolfie jerked his thumb at his female companion ? " that comes after . How long  | do you think them Neo-rooneys are gon na last once you 've softened them up for all these jungle cons ? " He jerked his thumb at Guzman . " Ten years ? Thirty years , maybe ? " His voice rose . " So do n't come runnin to us about our business . Physician , heal thyself ' ? right , Lewis ? " " Fa-Cry-sek , " the Comandante said . " Fa-Cry-sek . " " Rufi-ni-to , " complained the whore called Suzie . " Silencio ! Nosotros hablamos ingles . We arr es-spik Ingliss ! " To Wolfie  --  though looking straight at Quarrier  --  Moon said , " You forgot the part about robbing the Indians of their own culture and then abandoning them " ? he raised his voice in mock outrage , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with nothing strong enough , neither their old culture nor a new one , to support them against the next group to come along . " " Oh yeah , " Wolfie said , " that 's right . Neither their old culture or a new one , " he yelled angrily at Quarrier , " and then you come runnin to us about our business . Well , all I can say is , Physician , heal thyself . ' " Quarrier said mildly , " They say that every sin has its justification in the mind of the sinner . " Pleased that he had acquitted himself so well , Wolfie had leaned back in his chair , relighting his cigar ; now he slammed forward once again . " Jeez ! You 're a smug sonofabitch , now ai n't you ! " he said to Quarrier . " And I 'll bet that kid of yours you mentioned a minute ago , the chicken-chow-mein eater , for Christ sake  --  I bet you already made another smug sonofabitch out of that kid already , am I right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never sinned in my whole life  --  I do n't believe in sin ! " " Smuk snuffa-bits , " Guzman repeated . " Smuk snuffa-bits . Ha , ha , ha , ha . " Quarrier opened his mouth to speak , then closed it . Moon got to his feet and made his way around the table . Behind him he heard Wolfie say , " Well , it just so happens I seen your kid , I run inta him on the street . Do n't get me wrong , he 's a real nice kid , Reverend , no shit . Listen , Reverend , you ai n't really  | a bad sonofabitch or nothin . It takes all kinds to make a world , know what I mean ? Know what I mean , Reverend ? " HOLDING his breath , swaying drunkenly beneath a bulb which illumined little more than grime and moisture , Moon stared awhile at the cement wall ; it took just such a hopeless international latrine in the early hours of a morning , when a man was weak in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead and rotten in the gut , to make him wonder where he was , how he got there , where he was going ; he realized that he did not know and never would . I le had confronted this same latrine on every continent and not once had it come up with an answer ; or rather , it always came tip with the same answer , a suck and gurgle of unspeakable vileness , a sort of self-satisfied low chuckling : Go to it , man , you 're pissing your life away . Standing there , swaying pleasantly , he grinned . I do not care , he thought . I no longer care . If I can just stay where the action is , I never will care , never again . In the dark corridor leading back into the bar-salon , Guzman 's son Fausto lay in wait ; he swung open a door for Moon 's inspection . Inside was a table and a cot ; there was no window . " Sss-t , senor , s-ss-t . " The boy 's eyes flashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through whose glass pane the head of fat Mercedes swam in a garish light . Then he pointed at Moon , then at the bed . When Moon only shrugged , Fausto scuttled ahead of him to the next door , jerked his thumb at it and grinned . There were murnnirings within . Bending forward a little , the boy made a basket of his arms and then , rolling his eyes , moved his hindquarters in and out spasmodically , in the manner of a dog . Moon entered the bar , disregarding the urgent tugging at his sleeve . As he suspected , it was none other than the perfidious Wolfie who was missing . Moon found himself face to face with the fat girl in mission gingham , who stuck her tongue out very slowly . " We arr es-spik Ingliss , " said the Comandante . He looked  | disgruntled , and was scratching his armpit inside his shirt . Across the table Quarrier was still present , his hands clenched on his knees , his face pale and rigid behind the dull thick lenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen of my aunt is on the table . " " You fren fock woo-mans , " Guzman retorted . He was glaring at Moon with an artless hatred that grew with every drink . When the fat girl reached over and stroked his arm , he drove her off with a backhand blow across the breasts . " Vete al diablo ! " commanded El Comandante . " We arr es-spik Ingliss ! " Quarrier said , " Did he tell you he 'd stolen my letter to the government about his methods with the Indians , in which I reported that he makes money in the slave trade ? Because I 've learned just that from our Mintipo believers here in town . " Moon put his glass down . " You just got here a few days ago , is n't that right ? " " That 's right . " Quarrier nodded up and down , aggrieved . " That boy Fausto showed him the address , and he read my letter and then tore it up , right under my nose . " " Send another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuse him of tampering with the mails . " He shook his head . " Take it from me , you 're a born Ioser . " After a pause Quarrier said , " Do you really think attacking the Indians is going to pacify them ? " " No , " Moon said , " but killing them is . " He reached over and seized Wolfie 's abandoned glass and drained off what was left in it . Wolfie came and signaled to his Fat-Girl . " That Suzie of yours , for Christ sake , " he complained to Moon . " She 's too damn drunk to move . " Mercedes got up and wandered toward him , clutching her arms to her hurt breast and glaring over her shoulder at the Comandante , who was drinking even more heavily than before . He glowered evilly at Wolfie and the girl , nodding his head as if to indicate that a moment of dreadful reckoning was at hand . When Wolfie yelled at him , " So what 's with you , you spic sonofabitch ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Moon and expelling noisy puffs of air , like a blowing horse ; after a time he disappeared toward the latrine . The place had emptied ; Fausto was sleeping behind the bar .  | An occasional head poked furtively through the door , but the window clientele had vanished . Somewhere a rooster crowed , and a pig snuffled in the mud street ; a light of the oncoming jungle dawn soured the bad light in the room . Quarrier tried doggedly to interest Moon in the Niaruna , showing him a crude dictionary compiled by Huben and Uyuyu . " They seem to use the same stem for verbs and nouns and adjectives , with just a change of affixes , and they have genders , and their second-person pronoun is ti . All this suggests an Arawakan stock , the only one in this region . Perhaps you know that some tribes in our own South may derive from the Arawak as well . And I remember something else : the Sioux word for the Life Force , the Great Mystery , is wakan ; in certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waka ! " " The Great , 1Ivstcry , huh ? " " You prohahly know much more than I do ? " " You are trying to tell me that there are similarities between the Plains Indians and these Indians we are going to bomb , is n't that right ? Well , there were much greater similarities between my people and the Crow , between my people and the Shoshone , and even when the one real enemy was the white man , we killed Crows and Shoshones whenever we had the chance . " Moon was silent for a time . Then he said suddenly , " I know all about you , Quarrier . You 're a pain-in-the-ass type , a nosy .. . Listen , we had one just like you when I was a kid , always appealing to our primitive nobility . He was all read up on the proud Cheyenne in paint and eagle feathers , and all he found was a pack of ragged halfbreeds chewing dog meat . Ca n't you see we 're trying to help you people ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white man came along , and here was this poor sonofabitch looking for gratitude ? " Then Wolfie shuffled in , swollen and sobered , one hand scratching his chin bristles , the other still fumbling with his trousers . Behind him marched Mercedes , looking put upon ; haughtily , arms still straight at her sides , she went on out the door into the street , like a huge toy . Wolfie glared sheepishly at Moon . " Lousy , " he said , and coughed and spat . " I mean , that was  | really a nowhere hump . Nowhere at all . " To Quarrier he said , " You got a wife upstairs here , right ? You people screw at least , I hope . So keep your eyes to yourself . " Quarrier rose without expression and went out toward the latrine . " Well , I 'm glad you got one , anyway , " Wolfie called . When Quarrier was gone , he said to Moon , " You dig that guy , huh ? " " He 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than most of them ; at least he 's not stupid . " " He 's not , huh ? You mean he just looks stupid . He just acts stupid . " Wolfie , scratching , sounded like a pig on a dry fence . " So where 's the treacherous greaser ? " But even as he spoke the door opened and the Comandante appeared . He too looked angry , and he yelled violently at his son Fausto , " Son of a cow ! Close the doors , close the shutters , before the Gran Hotel Dolores is stolen out from under you ! " And the boy , jolted from his sleep , dropped down behind the bar in case something was hurled at him , then darted out at the far end and scurried to close the doors . The Comandante pitched over to the table , where he drank down a half-bottle of beer at a single draught . When he came up for air he was breathing hoarsely . His color was bad and his fly was open . " We arr es-spik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded craftily toward the room in the rear . " Piloto , you wan focks woo-man , no ? La chica Suzie  --  drunk ! Ferry drunk ! " He raised both hands to the side of his head to indicate that the girl was unconscious . " Ahora " ? he pointed at the door ? " you focks Indio gurl , vanzos , no pay nada . " He raised two fingers , grinning triumphantly at Moon , his gold tooth gleaming . " Indio boy , " he said , " fock Indio gurl , no pay nada . " Moon grinned back at him . In a flat voice he said , " The Comandante is a dirty pig . Un maricon sin verguenza . " A moment later , he lay flat upon the floor . Guzman had taken a large beer bottle by the neck and whipped him a backhand blow along the skull ; he stood over Moon , holding the bottle by the neck . Quick as a snake , Moon thought , quick as a snake . The bottle was not broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | fractured skull , maybe . He gazed peacefully at Sheriff Guzman from the floor . If you do n't kill me now while you have the chance , he thought , you 're going to regret it . An arm appeared around the Sheriff 's neck , and a wild hairy face over his shoulder ; both disappeared from view . A woeful crash , a roar of animals , and the light on the ceiling spun ; the end of the world has conic at last , he thought , we have collided with the moon . And he sank away into oblivion . When he came to again , there was a kind of silence , the only sound a breathing and a scrape of feet ; he sat up , hauling at the table leg , and stared at the scene before him . Wolfic and Guzman were each using one hand to hold their pants up . They were circling in the center of the room , and in the free hand of each of them was a knife . Behind Wolfie , also circling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " 1 Icy , Wolf ? " " I see hint , " Wolfie said , his eyes fastened on Guzman . " I see the little lad . And the little lad gets one step closer , he 's gon na get his throat cut . " Wolfic had now secured his pants , and his free hand was extended out behind him toward the boy . He did not stop moving , but kept circling , circling , knees bent , in a kind of squat ; as he passed the table he seized a bottle by the neck and broke it in half  --  crack  --  on the table edge , and kept moving . Now he had a weapon in each hand . Passing , he said to Moon , " How you doin , kid ? " " Give me your knife . " " No , no , " Wolfie called back over his shoulder , " no , no . This one is mine . I le pulled the knife on me , not you . " The next time around he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife fighter , baby  --  he 'd take you . " Moon struggled to his feet , hanging on to the table , then crashed hack clumsily off the bench against the wall . " No , no , " Wolfic murmured next time around . " This one is mine , baby , this one would take you . " Though Moon 's eyes had cleared , his body was still paralyzed . He watched Wolfie with a vague dispassionate admiration for something done professionally , with grace : the flowing movements of the man , the sure feet flat to the floor for balance  | and silent as on tiptoe , the swift strong gliding legs , the big delicate hairy hands loose at the wrists , the long knife held out like an offering , blade flat , to pass more easily between ribs .. . Guzman bellowed at his son , " Fausto , Fausto ! El otro ! Matalo ! " Moon sat with his feet straight out and his palms on the bench and watched the frightened boy coming to kill him . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wide agonized mouth like a hole  --  crash  --  a spot on the wall and falling glass and the boy broke away with a little screech , dropping his upraised weapon , for Wolfie had whirled and whipped his jagged bottle at the boy 's head . Guzman broke to lunge and slash at Wolfie , who turned under and out and away so easily that Guzman stopped short and dropped his arm in surprise and  --  yes , Moon thought , yes , there it is , the good old fear . He had seen Wolfie 's knife come out before and he was sorry he had missed the moment this time , for it was one of the prettiest things that he had ever seen . It was like the first electric movement of a dance : the draw from inside the shirt was too fast for the eye , so that the forward and outward motion of the blade as the hand unfolded seemed slow-motion by comparison , and lethal because it was so graceful and unhurried , like a ritual performed many times over . Guzman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have quit right then and there . The boy whimpered , coming up again with his bottle , but he was no longer in the fight . Wolfie sensed all of this and grinned , moving in closer , for Guzman 's step had straightened . The big man , until now as quick as Wolfie , was moving slowly , his legs stiffening ; in a moment he would lose his nerve and freeze  --  and then , Moon thought , your only chance is to make your move or run before you freeze . Moon watched the pale unshaven face with distaste for what now must happen , but without pity . Wolfie had not yet made a pass , though he had feinted once in play and laughed when his foe leaped back ; the intense happy grin on Wolfie 's face parted his beard . That was the terrifying thing . Moon knew now what Wolfie had known from the beginning : that the outcome had never been in question , not even  | when there had been two against him . It was the big man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of his still more awesome and implacable assurance , that had shaken his nerve beyond repair . " Villains ! " Well , Moon thought , did 1 say that ? He turned his head . Quarrier stood there in the door leading to the latrine , the near-naked body of the small Indian girl in his arms and on his face the ultimate outrage of Jehovah . Quarrier , mouth open , glared at the shambles of the room in disbelief : the knife fighters and broken bottles , the cringing boy , the torpid Moon . Wolfie had halted in mid-stride to stare at Quarrier . Moon yelled a warning and struggled to his feet . In the same second Wolfic ducked so low that his fingertips grazed the floor , and came out and up again , knife erect . Guzman tried too late to stop his lunge ; as he fell , he rolled sideways with a grunt , casting away his knife , and when he struck the floor , yanked his knees up to his stomach and his arms up to his face : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own knife shivering ; then he whirled and rushed at Quarrier , shoving the knife point at his face . " You stinkin bitch ! Did n't I tell you keep your nose out ? Did I or did n't 1 ? You spoiled it , you gone and spoiled it . " He actually stamped his foot . " Jesus ! " he shouted . And he drove his knife so hard into the table that the wood split . Sensing that Wolfic had lost interest in him , Guzman scrambled for his weapon , then leaped to his feet in fighting posture , bounding and circling and bellowing with rage . In terror of his father 's ferocity Fausto screeched , " Papa , Papa ! " But Guzman had the wit not to catch Wolfie 's eye , addressing himself instead to Quarrier . " Hah , evangelico ! Hah , estzipido ! " And he pointed his knife at the girl . Quarrier tried clumsily to pull her skirt down  --  she was naked underneath  --  but since the cloth was bunched against his waist , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skirt fell . " Hah , " Guzman cried again , smiting his palm to his forehead , " evangelico ! Evangelico fock Indio gurl ! "  | " Yeah , how about that ? " Wolfie murmured . " How about that ? " " No , " Moon said , " he did n't do that . " He remembered how the missionary had stared down the girl 's dress . " Do n't be stupid , Wolf . " " Stupid ! " Wolfie grunted , nodding his head . " And this to the guy that only just saved his life . " He slumped angrily into a chair . The Indian girl had come around . She sat alone against the wall under a yellow bulb , as if in wait for someone to come and tell her where she must go . Hands pressed like fig leaves to her crotch , she stared dully at the men , uncomprehending . With her lipstick and earrings gone , she was no more than a child . Quarrier stood at the table . The girl had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said to Moon , " Do you realize what these evil brutes have done ? Do you care ? I do n't know what to say to you ? " " Do n't say nothin then , " Wolfie told him . He shouted suddenly at Guzman , " You want us to fly tomorrow , prick ? Because if you do , you better get our papers set . " Guzman , once he had understood , roared angrily in acquiescence . He drove the Indian girl out the door into the dawn and his son after her , fetching the latter a slap across the head . " Son of a cow , " he bawled , " go home to your poor mother , Dona Dolores , and tell her that her husband , El Comandante Don Rufino Guzman , has set out on his journey to the casa ! " Quarrier spread his arms in a gesture toward the room which , with the shutters closed , had become dense with smoke , and stank of sweat and spilled cheap beer and breathing . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He shook his head . Moon took his bottle of ayahuasca and moved toward the stairs . " I told you , friend , " he said , " you 're a born loser . " " Ai n't we all , " snarled Wolfie , " ai n't we all . "  | IT HAD BEEN THE CONFRONTATION WITH THE PADRE , HE DECIDED , that had set in motion that series of grotesque events . And though the episodes had been the fault of Guzman and Wolfie , the man who had upset him most was Lewis Moon . She 's got nice tits , would n't you say : Aow , how that phrase still twisted him ! Moon had faced him with his own perfidy , his longing for another man 's wife , and even worse , a sinful lust for women in general , including the poor little Indian believer . He could not excuse this on the grounds that Hazel had been cold to him , for to his astonishment her growing terror of this place , her disapproval of his every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had shocked him mightily , not only because it was so unlike her , but because of its greedy and insatiable nature . Perhaps he should send her home from this jungle that deranged her so . But she had no memory of her night fevers and refused to discuss what she considered his false concern for her . Except to accuse him of consorting with killers and harlots , she had  | scarcely said a word to him since they came to Madre de Dios . She had become so dogmatic since leaving home , so frightened ! Yet even back in North Dakota , it had been difficult to persuade her to learn a little Spanish , for was n't Spanish a Catholic language ? Had Hazel been reared far away from the Protestant heartland of the Great Plains , she would have made a redoubtable Catholic or even Communist ; it was the dogma that attracted her , the securiy of righteousness , for she felt no need to understand her faith . Yours is the big girl , with black hair . How careless that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself and to Hazel but to all women . What sort of man was this ? He had almost given up on Moon as a cold sinful killer , a man who thought and spoke , when he spoke at all , in short quiet starts of violence . And it was just after he had asked if attacking the Indians was going to pacify them , and Moon had said , No , but killing them is  --  and to think that , startled by such dreadful cynicism , he had almost laughed ! He had to get hold of himself ! ? that Moon , blaspheming , seeking to corrupt , had nonetheless spoken to him with passion , and in warning . Why did moral judgment of this man seem beside the point ; could it be that Moon was fatally damned , beyond redemption ? He had never heard of such a thing . You 're a devil  --  a true devil ! To try to corrupt If 1 can corrupt your faith , it smells already to high heaven , right ? Moon had leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened , Mr. Quarrier . But you warned us a while ago that we would go to hell , so I am warning you  --  he laughed  --  that you are there already . You 're in the jungle now , up to your fat God-fearing ass , and in the jungle the game gets a little rougher . You 're very drunk . Why , you 're not even making sense ! Perhaps I 'm not . But I see that you understand me . When Moon had gone off to bed , he and Wolfie were left staring at each other across the wreckage of the evening . " Moon ? So how do I know about Moon  --  I mean , he 's only my friend and I still do n't know 'm ! " Wolfie waved Quarrier  | away . " Like , do n't bug me , Reverend . You do n't get to know guys like Moon , for Christ sake , they do n't stand still long enough . You either swing with 'm or you do n't , that 's all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to talk again . " I do n't know why I even tolerate this madman , you know it ? " He shook his head . " There 's this kind of very way-out cat ? like you run inta him all over the world , and each time he looks different and each time he disappears , but always I know I 'm goin to run inta him again , because the guy is on the road , he 's always on the road , and he 's got nine lives and nine names and nine faces . Only this one , this Moon , he 's different . I run inta him in Israel , and since then we been to Cuba and all over . Like in some way which I ani too stupid to figure it out , he 's beautiful , see , and also he 's mean as catshit . They do n't come no meaner than Lewis Moon , and you never know when he 's goin to be mean or when he 's goin to he beautiful . I le always cons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand ? ? there ai n't no difference . " Wolfie glanced up . " I mean , you seen how quiet he is ? Well , that quiet sonofabitch is also the angriest sonofabitch I ever knew . IIc 'd give you his last dime one second and break your neck the next , and you 'd never know why he done either one . " According to Wolfie , they had lost their American citizenship for fighting in the armies of foreign countries ; their plane they had stolen in Cuba , and they had come with it to South America via Hispaniola , Barbados , the Windwards and Venezuela . Lacking visas , they stayed away from the big towns on the coast and worked the hack country . In Cuba , Wolfie had taught Moon to fly ; Wolfic was also a mechanic . They had banged down the continent to Tierra del Fuego , where they had made big money bombing out a rash of oil-well fires . It was on the strength of this feat that Wolfie had painted on the fuselage Wolfie &; Moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had operated two new bulldozers that no Paraguayan could run , and had torn up the landscape near Asuncion more or less at will until the day when Wolfie was slapped in the face by a low branch of a huge tree ; he had battered the giant to the ground , demolishing the new bull- dozer in the process . He was freed from an ancient jail by Moon , who destroyed it with the remaining bulldozer ? " I wake up and there he is , right next to me , yankin on the controls ! " ? but they were caught immediately . They were on the point of being shot , Wolfie was certain , when Moon handed over to the guards some river diamonds he had once picked up in Venezuela ; they took off in their plane that night and crossed the border into Bolivia . In Bolivia they had settled for a while , flying for the new revolutionary government , and then for the still newer revolutionaries who took over in Santa Cruz de la Sierra . With the defeat of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had flown to Riberalta in the Beni , where their last money had gone for a tank of gas . That same day they had crossed the border . " Moon 's been all over this lousy continent , you know , on foot , for Christ sake . Took him three years , and all he 's got to show for it is malaria . " Wolfie shook his head . " Like I says to him , Lewis , like what are you , some kind of a mas-o-chist or what ? Like , there 're jag-you-ars here ! Not to mention all them serpents , Lewis , and tarantulas and crocs and vampires and poison arrows . Whatta you got , I says to him , some kind of a hang-up about this place ? I says , Gim me Frisco or the Village any time , that 's the Old Wolf 's kind of jungle ! " Wolfie looked restless ; he needed to talk and was prepared to talk too much . Quarrier noticed how careful the man was to establish his expertise in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if Moon were some easily recognized and very valuable phenomenon that others might try to steal . " Oh , I do n't mean I ai n't heard things , " Wolfie confided . " Like , in Cuba , I ran inta some guy who knew a guy that said he done time with Moon , you know , in stir ; if you wan na know what for , do n't ask me . And once I seen he had some kind of a union card , and it turns out he worked over in New York with them Mohawks or Mohicans or whatever the hell they are that work on the high girders in them new buildings . After that , he was in the merchant marine , and one year he jumped ship in  | Maracaibo . He got up in them rivers and got hold of a big haul of them river diamonds some way , and that was all the stake he needed . He bummed around this continent on foot  --  like one little knapsack . Even the handle of his razor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Christ sake ! " Wolfie laughed . " He learned long ago to travel light , and he never give up the habit ; he do n't own nothin and he do n't want to . Once I asked him what the hell he thought he was loin down here , and he told me he was huntin for wild Indians . I lc said there was horse Indians in Patagonia that fought with the goyim just like on the Plains , but they was all on reservations , and the Indians down there in Tierra del Fuego were , ill gone . The mountain Indians , he said , were nothin but tame diggers , and from what he heard about the jungle tribes they were nothins  --  little rats , like , sneakin around in swamps . Right about then , he got had dysentery and malaria , so he grabbed a ship out of Callao , west for Hong Kong . " Wolfic got up and scratched himself all over with both hands . lie was tottering , and placed one foot slightly ahead , to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told ya nothin , because I do n't really know nothin ; I only picked up a little here and there , from things he said . " He blinked . " Where was I ? " He frowned at Quarrier . " Oh yeah . So do n't go gettin nosy . " Quarricr stood , but Wolfie waved him down again . " What are you ? " he demanded . " Hyperthyroid ? " He shook his head again , astounded at his own patience with the world . He whistled a little , his head nodding . Quarrier was listening for his snore when Wolfie said , " For all he says about himself he might as well have come from Mars , only I happen to know it 's out West somewheres  --  he 's part Indian . His father was halfbreed Cheyenne Indian and French Canuck , his mother halfbreed Mississippi Choctaw , which prolly this makes him some nutty kind of a Negro . But it do n't matter where he comes from ; like I was saying , a guy like that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I been around a lot  --  I mean , I ai n't like him or nothin , I ai n't no drifter  --  and I run inta other ones just like him . He do n't belong nowhere , he 's like a house cat somebody runs  | out on , you know , like turns out at the edge of some woods : he do n't belong where he comes from and he do n't belong where he is , so he keeps movin , and soon he 's a wild animal that you do n't never tame again . " " But you , " Quarrier said . " You 're going home . " " Yeah , " Wolfie said tiredly . He slumped back against the wall . " I mean , I been just about everywhere , I seen enough of life . Some one of these fine days I 'm goin home . I even got a wife and boy home , see . " " You do ? " " Well , kind of . Azusa 's common-law . Azusa and Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You mean Richard ? " " No . Dick . We named the infint Dick . " Wolfie shrugged . " For some goddamn reason when I say that , Lewis always laughs . " " But tomorrow  --  today , I mean  --  you 're going to go out and bomb those innocent ? " " Oh , man . " Wolfie stood up . " You know ? Like , cool it . According to what this Guzman says these Neo-rooneys been massacrin for thirty years . That makes them bloodthirsty savages , do n't it ? And anyway , this Guzman , he 's got us by the balls . " He stared appraisingly at Quarrier . " You ai n't a bad guy , Reverend . You come to Frisco , Reverend , you look me up . In Sausalito or any of them North Beach expressos , they all know me . If they let me back in the good old U.S. and A. , that is . You just ask for Wolfie . " He stuck out his hand . " All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Pleased to meetcha , " Wolfie said , " I 'm sure . " QUARRIER was at the airstrip the next morning when Wolfie &; Moon , Inc. , went to work . The airplane had already been gassed up , although as a precaution the Comandante still held their passports . Moon 's whole face was swollen from Guzman 's blow , and his grin was painful . He nodded to Quarrier , but Wolfie , who  | looked terrible , had apparently forgotten their new friendship , and responded to Quarrier 's " Good morning " by spitting noisily on the ground . " You 're going ahead with it then ? " Quarrier said . Moon said , " The bombardier here could n't hit Bolivia today , much less a village . " " So how conic you dragged me out here ? " Wolfie said . " The way you fly even when you ai n't got no hangover , I 'm lucky to get back alive . " " The fresh air will do you good . " " Fresh air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dank heat . " There ai n't a breath of fresh air in this whole miserable continent . " " Please do n't do this , " Quarrier said . Without answering him they climbed into the plane . Moon waved enigmatically at Quarrier as the engine noise exploded . The plane jounced and wobbled to the end of the runway , where it roared a moment , shaking like a leaf ; then it spun around and came hack down the strip , bounding the ruts and depressions like some huge ancient bird seeking to get aloft . The wheels had scarcely left the ground when it curved away ; by the time it cleared the trees , it was already headed eastward . When the silence had settled down again and the loiterers had begun to drift away , one man remained . " Ah , " the priest said . " Good morning , Mr. Quarrier . " They did not attempt to cross the strip of ground between them . " Good morning , Padre , " Quarrier said , starting away . " Have you thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what question ? " " It 's quite simple . I asked you , do you think he cares ? " " Do you mean Yoyo ? " " Why , but who else ? Oh yes , oh yes , I see ! " The padre actually clapped his hands . " Very good , Mr. Quarrier ! Excellent ! Bravo ! " Quarrier had started back toward the town and Xantes kept pace with him , remaining on the far side of the road . They went  | along slowly in the heat . Quarrier was amazed ; this man was laughing at him ! " I do n't want to discuss this with you , " he told him finally . " I do n't understand why you talk to me at all . " " We have a common problem : the Niaruna . " " The Niaruna are no longer your concern . " The priest raised his eyebrows . " On the contrary , " he said . And he stepped firmly in front of Quarrier , blocking his path . He told Quarrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Niaruna on the very site on the Rio Espiritu where Leslie Huben had since established his own outpost . " The Indians , " Xantes remarked , " think it demeaning to harvest crops from a chacra cleared by other people , but apparently Senor Huben does not share this view . " Before Quarrier could defend Huben , the priest had passed on to an account of the martyrdom . There were two nuns with Fuentes , and all three were taken alive ; the sisters were later returned in a barter deal arranged by Yoyo , in which two women of Huben 's tame Niaruna band were delivered to the savages . By this time the sisters had been martyred so decisively and so often that both preferred to give up Indian work and return to their convent in Spain . " This convent is built , " Padre Xantes said , with a sad smile , " in the manner of a citadel  --  impregnable . " According to Yoyo , the martyrdom of the Dominicans had commenced on the trail leading eastward from the mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuentes , his death might have been more prompt and even , perhaps , more merciful . But they imagined from his cassock that he was female . " They had not got far into the jungle when it came into their heads to rape my poor compadre . Imagine their chagrin ! Pues , to make this historia a brief one , they became angry at the deception and beheaded him . We found the body eight days later . " The priest stared coldly at Quarrier , who stared as coldly back . It seemed to him that this curious man had actually taken relish in the telling . " You will now see , " Xantes remarked after a moment , " why I am presently at a disadvantage in regard to the Niaruna . I have written for a replacement for the good Fuentes , but the record of  | the Niaruna does not inspire many volunteers . You will also see why I consider the Niaruna my concern . Why , all the jungle peoples , and the mestizos too , and the patrones and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , even yourself , Senor Quarrier  --  arc my concern . Good day ! " And the little Dominican , bowing , hurried on ahead of Quarrier on the bare path beneath the bare brown sky , his frail body struggling in his heavy cloth , his thin head bobbing . QUAnarn:R spent the morning in the dining room , at work on 1 Iuhen 's Niaruna dictionary . While he knew that it was important that he do this , he was extremely restless , and was constantly distracted from his work by the random complaints of fat Mercedes and by the thin fatalistic townspeople , pigs , children , vultures and indentured Indians who paused before the window . He was plagued by worry about Billy , about what might befall them in the months ahead , about the stranger who passed her days on the other bed  --  the stranger for whom , he kept reminding himself , he was responsible . But more often he thought about Andy Hubcn and the fact that at a time of terrible peril he was sinfully attracted to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to glare and snigger . Twice that day Guzman himself came by to check the hotel accounts . Each time , seeing Quarrier at the table in his salon , he winced and snarled and cleared his throat with violence as if , had it not been his own hotel , he would have liked nothing better than to spit copiously upon the floor . Quarrier had placed his chair so that he could see the hallway and be sure to intercept Wolfie and Moon when they returned to the hotel . However , he soon fell asleep , doped by the sun and the drone of flies ; he awoke sometime later at the roar of a plane and the sound of running feet . In the street , people were standing in the mud , staring upriver . From out of the haze came the growl of a small airplane , invisible , and then the growl rose to a shriek as the plane plunged toward the earth . For a moment , over the edge of town ,  | a bruise formed in the haze , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plunge into the trees upriver . But its roar continued , reverberating wildly in the forest ; a few seconds later it rose once more , too steeply , into the overcast , its motor dying to a point no longer audible . Then , incredibly , it dove again . After this dive  --  the third , according to those in the street ? it leveled off and headed for the airport ; the people , wringing their small hands , ran out to meet it . When the fliers appeared at the hotel , Quarrier set himself to question them . But Wolfie looked sick and exhausted , and though Moon 's face was composed , his shirt front and throat were heavily caked with blood . Moon scarcely nodded at him . " Nice country , " he remarked , and went upstairs . Toward evening Quarrier cornered Wolfie , who was in evil humor . They had not yet attacked the Niaruna villages , Wolfie said , but he refused to say anything else . Moon was already under the effects of ayahuasca . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forget it . Like , do n't bother . He drunk enough to turn on a rhinoceros . I seen him flip on this Indian soup before , down in the Beni . It 's like I told him after : Lewis  --  he do n't like being called Lew , see , only Lewis , which this is some goddamn family name or other , so I call him Lewis , for Christ sake  --  Lewis , I told him after , like make it with pot , Lewis , or hash , man , or peyote , you can even shoot it if you wan na , jam the needle right inta your miserable brain , Lewis , only just lay off this jungle junk , this Hiawatha . I mean , who needs some kind of a loo-natic around , who needs it ? And you know what he says to me ? Lewis , I mean , this crazy Lewis says , I need it ; it allows me to see . You 're outa your fuckin mind , I told him . " To Quarrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well have listened to a savage ; the waving hands , the cries and grunts made the problem very similar . Although he got the gist of the speech before it ended , he was wincing and frowning so violently in his concentration that Wolfie himself recoiled in alarm . " Look out ! Back up ! " he cried . " What 's the matter , you gon na puke or what ? " He started away , then turned back , furi- ous . " Jesus , here I 'm tryna tell you somethin which this is for your own good , and what do you do  --  you gawk at me like it was me that was the lunatic , not you guys . " He stomped into the bar , still shouting . " You 're livin in Nutsville , Pancho , take it from me , " he told the bar man , who crouched back in terror against the bottles ; Wolfic , who claimed to be incapable of telling foreigners apart , had forgotten that he had tried to kill this boy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brow . " Another one ! " Quarrier looked up to see Hazel , drawn from her room by WoIhc 's uproar , staring at him in horror from the stairwell . She looked like an old woman . " You 're laughing , " she cried . " How can you laugh ? Are you insane ? "  | THEY PICKED UP THE RIo ESPIRITU AT REMATE , AND FOLLOWED IT north and east . By airplane the distance was not great , for Moon did not follow the serpentine river but swung across the bends . They crossed several Tiro villages ; some of the Indians scattered into the forest while others ran out into the yard between the huts to stare at the terrible bird . Then for a long time there were no signs of life , only the dark green of the canopy and the glisten of black water in the swamps and wormy creeks . Soon the Espiritu itself was no more than a creek , and now an unmapped river came into view , unwinding eastward ; the headwaters of the rivers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in opposite directions . On the bank of the unnamed river , back a little distance from the bank , there appeared a deserted village . Moon swung over it in a low glide . The village had not been abandoned but evacuated : a wisp of smoke and the Indian dog that scurried across the open yard confirmed this . One small incendiary , he thought , will take care of this whole outfit . They circled back to the Espiritu and this time found the mission settlement : two large huts and a wooden cross . They must have passed right over it , and it was easy to see why they  | had missed it , for in the short time since Huben left , the jungle had reclaimed it . The huts were smudged by vines and leaves , their outlines blending with shadows , and the yard itself was a tumult of green strands and infestations . The wooden cross had been seized by a thick liana and was tilted crazily , about to topple . A damp miasmic heat seeped through the plane each time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning light , as if the earth were cooling still in some primordial gray morning . The scene was so infernal that even Wolfie , startled from his doze by Moon 's maneuvers , spoke in horror . " Whatta these Indians got ? " I lc coughed , in pain . " Some kind of a emotional involvement with this place ? " At a loss as to where to spit , he swallowed , wincing . " Oo , " he said . " Like , I 'm dyin , man . " He reached behind hint to unstrap the crate that held small incendiary and fragmentation bombs . " This ai n't gon na be no bombin , man . This is what you might call pest control . " " Go back to sleep , " Moon said . " There 's nothing to bomb yet . " Wolfie settled back , clasping his hands on his gut as he closed his eyes ; he blew a loud sigh through his lips . " There ai n't , huh ? Well , if I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jungle from end to end . I mean it . It gives me the creeps , I do n't even like to look at it even . " He sat up again and stared at it . " Whee-oo ! " he said , and shook like a wet dog . " So why do n't we unload a few of these highly dangerous explosives and cut back to Madre and grab the bread and split ? " Moon left the mission area and moved back up the river to the empty village and circled it at a distance ; in comparison with the mission station , the yard was brown and bare and the thatch clean . " All right , Lewis , maybe you do n't wan na bomb no Indians , is that what you 're sayin ? Who needs it , you 're askin me . What 'd these noble redskins ever do to us , right ? They 're only just another minority group , right ? So that 's exactly what I 'm tellin you  --  it do n't matter where you drop the bombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I care , or right on their lousy heads , that 's  | beautiful too , but anyway , like it do n't matter  --  let 's just drop somethin in case this Guzman got his nose inta this crate and counted , and then we waltz back to Madre havin done our duty fait'fully ; and by tomorra night , man , we 're outa the jungle , we come up for air ... " Getting no response , Wolfie sighed with disgust and subsided once again , eyes closed . Moon scarcely noticed him . He was intent on the still , silent clearing , the silent watchful waiting , as tangible as blood  --  he could feel it right through the noise and vibration of the plane . Unlike the Tiro , the fierce Niaruna were terrified . These inner rivers were narrow and winding , so that the pontoon planes used in the jungle could not land on them beyond Remate ; the chances were that the savages hidden in the trees below had never seen a plane in all their lives . The rain forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , and part of it was thought to cross the disputed frontier into the jungles of Amazonas . The only scheduled flight within five hundred miles was the plane that came twice each week to Madre de Dios and returned across the Andes . He circled closer , banking low ; he could scarcely hope to glimpse the Niaruna , and he was about to climb again when he saw what he had come down to this continent to see . A naked man appeared at the edge of the clearing , and stamping violently on the ground , raised a black bow . Moon did not see the arrow until it hung suspended for an instant at the top of its arc : a gleam of blue-and-yellow feathering , like a small bird , a turn of dull light on the cane shaft .. . " ... like , one problem , " Wolfie was saying , " was gettin her to be , you know , like intimate . Man , I tried everythin , even daisies . Finely I grabbed her hand and put it there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind of a joke : her sayin she would never touch me , I was too funky , man , I was not her type , Azusa said . Well , I was kind of , you know , like intrigued . So I got her to promise just one little thing : If you ever touch it , Zoose , I says , just even once , then we go all the way  --  right , baby ? " Until this moment the only Indians that Moon would acknowledge were the old men of his childhood who had survived  | the long wars with the whites on the Great Plains . Most were reduced to the white man 's denims and were grateful for rolled cigarettes and sweet canned foods , but one of these old warriors , steadfastly scorning the government dole , had lived out his stubborn life in a small cave . This old man spoke often of Charles Bent , the halfbrecd Cheyenne son of Trader Bent of Bent 's Old Fort , down on the Arkansas , whose rage had only found relief in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had escaped the slaughter of Black Kettle 's unsuspecting people at Sand Creek , and after that had tried to kill his own white father . With his young warriors of the Dog Society , Charles Bent had waged revenge so cruel and savage that the Cheyennes themselves , the Race of Sorrows , who had suffered more death and betrayal from the whites than any tribe on the Great Plains , had turned their backs on hint . But a few Cheyennes still knew Bent 's name , and Moon , peering into the bright mad old eyes of this ancient cave dweller , caught a brief flicker of that lunatic rage that closed the heart and snapped the teeth shut like a trap , and caused a man 's whole head and frank to shudder . This old man 's son , named James Mad Raven , after years of apathy and sullen silence , had performed the outlawed Sun Dance all alone . Leaning back at the end of a lariat run through his breast skin with a harness awl , he circled a dead tree by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the skin tore and he fainted . At the request of the missionaries , he was seized and jailed , and he died in jail of the shock and pneumonia brought on by his ritual wounds . Lewis Moon had watched the Sun Dance of James Mad Raven , had seen him lying stunned beneath the sky in greasy dungarees and sateen cowboy shirt with fake pearl studs , and old black broken street shoes , without socks . The old men had known something that their heirs would never know ever again . Because they were pleased by the boy 's interest , they talked in front of him for hours on end about the last great Councils of the Chis-Chis-Chash , as the Cheyennes called themselves , when Two Moons and Dull Knife had joined forces with Gall 's Uncapappas and the Oglallah Lakotas of Chief Crazy Horse against the troopers . Before the great victory at the  | Greasy Grass Creek , they had numbered fifteen hundred lodges , and the smoke of their fires had shrouded the blue sky of the high plains . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast triumphant sight , the thousands of campfires and ponies galloping and colors and buffalo meat and smoky smells and wolf howls and wild yelling . There were wild tribes in Paraguay and in Bolivia and on the rivers south of the Guianas , but he had never reached them . And once there had been wild horse Indians  --  the Araucanians and Tehuelches  --  in Patagonia , but he had arrived there a halfcentury too late ; as in the case of the Plains tribes , the few thousand remnants had been penned up on reservations . He had wandered down to Tierra del Fuego and stared into the face of the last Yahgan left on earth . The bright shimmer of the arrow , the lone naked figure howling at the sky  --  it had been years since he had grinned like that , with all his lungs and heart ; he actually yipped in sheer delight . Now he had sensed something unnamable and always known , something glimpsed , hinted at , withheld by sun and . wind , by the enormous sky .. . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your face , you 're makin noises ! " Wolfie shrugged , and clasped his hands behind his head . " Anyway , Old Azusa knew that I meant business , see , like she grown wary . And I was gon na give up hope on her , and was kickin myself for gettin hung-up on a chick that was sexually disturbed , when one night we was sittin in this art film , eatin popcorn outa the same box , and she says , Did you find the prize yet ? This popcorn got these little prizes , see . Well , like instantly I get this beautiful idea from this joke that I heard it once , but beautiful , the answer to a maiden 's prayer . As usual I had , you know , this erection , so quick as a mink I work a hole through the bottom of the box , with my fingers , I mean , and insert it , you know , all sweet and innocent , nestlin right up amongst these popcorns , dig ? Then I whispers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it yet , I 'll race you . Well , Old Azusa digs right in ? she 's still watchin this art film , see  --  and wharnmo ! What the hell kind of corn d' you call this ? she yells . It 's livin ! That 's the prize ,  | I says to her , that them popcorn people laid on you , like maybe it 's some nutty kind of a pet . Well , you know , man , that crazy chick  --  once she got hold of it she never let go for a week , and it was exactly nine months after this art film that we gave birt ' to this infint which we named it Dick ... " The lone man was still leaping in the clearing . Three more Indians ran forward as Moon banked around , but they did not raise their bows . Crossing again , he saw them struggling with the bowman , trying to drag him back into the forest . They succeeded , for a moment later the clearing was as empty as before . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low that he had to yank hack on the stick to clear the trees again . This time , glancing back as he banked away , he saw the Indians , a band of thirty or more , appear at the edge of the clearing , running and gesticulating at one another ; several men tossed their bows to the ground . When he passed again , they fell to their knees , staring straight up at him , and clasped their hands upon their breasts . He came in lower to make certain , the shadow of the plane like a black hammer on the clearing ; when the shadow crossed them , they broke and scattered off into the forest . Wolfie , who had reared up when the plane dived , missed what Moon had seen ; he had heaved joyfully around and wrestled a bomb out of its nest , and by the time he turned back again and set to work removing the panel on his side window , he saw only the Niaruna 's final flight . " Now you 're swingin , man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothin but a bunch of Jews . " Taking Moon 's silence for surprise , he laughed . " What are you , ignorant ? This is the Lost Tribe of Israel , man , ai n't you heard that ? " He hooted gleefully . " And now is their turn to get persecuted , just in case they forgot how it was back there in Tel Aviv . " Moon laughed . " Put that stuff back , " he said . " Do n't put me on now , Lewis . " Still struggling with the window , Wolfie gazed at him suspiciously . " Bombs away , man , if I can get this mother open long enough  --  some bombin plane , that 's all I got ta say . Why in Christ did we steal this for ? " He paused a minute , wheezing . " Where you goin ? Come on , man ! "  | Moon said , " I did n't see you getting set , or I would have told you we did n't need it . " He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downriver . " Did n't see me ? Like , man , I am seated next to you , man , in the adjoinin seat . What are you , far-sighted ? " Wolfie returned the bombs to their crate ; he was grunting angrily . " You woulda thought you woulda smelt me , at least , with this lousy jungle sweat I 'm workin up . Every time I raise my arm , I knock myself out practically . This Christly jungle ! " He swore and muttered for a while , but by the time he turned around again to stare balefully out across the jungle , his voice had lowered and turned cold . " Look , " he said , " you better answer me . I 'm sick of clownin , Lewis , you 're gon na push me too far . I ai n't noticed you hesitated to get blood on your hands when the price was right , so come on , explaina me , what is it ? You dig Indians but not spades , is that right ? And them Cubans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what I hear  --  you do n't mind bombin them . " He heaved around . " But Indians , never . Them little brown nudes down there that are prolly cannibals and I do n't know what else , no dice , not them ! " Wolfie was panting . When Moon remained silent , he looked confused . " Jesus ! So just do n't push me too far , " he said . " Oh yeah , where was I ? So I want you to explain to me . " " It sounds like you 're explaining something to me , " Moon said . Wolfie nodded . " You 're kind of a smart-ass sometimes , you know that , Lewis ? I was just rememberin last night , the way you told me I was kind of stupid sometimes . You do n't even think you hafta bother explainin nothin , because Old Wolfie is stupid and ignorant , right ? A kind of a clown you keep around for kicks . You think all you got ta do is say , So Wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say that Lewis Moon is a cold-hearted communistical murderin sonofabitch , you know that , do n't you ? A bum . That you never been off the road in your life and would n't know how to make a honest buck , so you kill for money . A lot of people would say that , Lewis . " " A lot of people would , " Moon agreed .  | " God , you 're just so sweet and cool , now ai n't you ? Christ ! " Wolfie drove his fist so hard against the side of the plane that the fuselage quaked . " I had enough of this ! How in hell did I get tied up with a cat like you in the first place , that 's what I wan na know . Well , listen , let me tell you somethin , college boy , who was it taught you to fly ? You ai n't so smart as you think , when you got to learn your Iivin from me . And another thing , before I hooked up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my sidekick , it was Wolfie-and-his-friends wherever I went , and what I wan na know is , what did you do for a patsy before I conic along ? You have some kind of a congenital idiot , or what ? " " tact 's see now . There was Kublai Cahn , he got shot down in the Negev . Or was that you ? With those rabbi beards , " Moon said softly , and smiled at Wolfie , " it 's hard to tell you Jews apart . " Wolfic 's knife was out so fast that Moon raised his eyebrows , impressed . I Ic shitted his head minutely , for the tip of the blade was against his throat , under his chin ; it had broken the skin , and he felt a warns trickle slide down to his collar . " I had enough , , Aloon , like I told you . " Wolfie 's voice was thick and quiet . " When you get to Madre , you better put down nice and easy . " Staring straight ahead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he would drop in for a landing , and that was probably not sufficient time for Wolfie to cool off . Very gradually he cased off course . " Straighten out . South-southwest 183 degrees . " So . . . Moon shrugged and grinned , and the grin spread quickly across his face ; he knew he must not laugh , but he could not help himself . Already his body shook , and then his mouth fell open with the laugh and the knife cut him again . " Do n't laugh , " Wolfie said . " Because I ai n't laughin and I ai n't kiddin . " Then the pain overtook Moon and he stopped . The whole front of his shirt was damp with blood . Wolfie said coldly , " You 're a fuckin maniac , you know that ? "  | Moon held his head as still as possible . In the near distance he could see Madre de Dios , the smoke of the lumber mill and the hot glaze on the tin roofs . After a while he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When we get in . I do n't want you bleedin all over my aircraft . " He forced Moon 's head back slowly on the knife tip . " There ai n't much I 'd put past you , but Jew-baitin ! It 's okay for a Jew to be a anti-Semite , but not no goyim bastard like you . " Moon glanced at him quickly ; he caught the faint humorous flicker before Wolfie could suppress it . " Not that that 's the only reason , " Wolfie snarled . " Did you see that guy shoot an arrow at the plane ? " Moon considered knocking Wolfie 's arm away and throwing the plane into a roll . But though he had little to lose by this maneuver , he had nothing at all to gain ; Wolfie would kill him with the first reflex . Then he heard Wolfie 's voice again , and from its tone he knew that he had won . " That 's a reason not to bomb ? Are you outa your mind , Moon ? You really mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunatic of a Indian is nutty enough to shoot an arrow at us ? " And though this was exactly what Moon did mean , he now turned his head and gazed coldly at his partner . He was sorry that he had pleaded , however obliquely , and now that he had gained an edge , the knife point at his chin infuriated him . " Do n't try to understand anything , " he said . " Just put that knife back and shut up . " And he thought with a wild icy glee , Now you 've done it . Now you 've done it . Wolfie forced his head back once again , drawing new blood . " C'm on , set the plane down . This ca n't wait . " " Suppose I do n't . " " I 'll give it to you here . I can fly this thing too , remember ? " Moon jammed the stick forward and tipped the plane into a dive . Before they gained speed he yelled , " If we still have wings when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side window , okay , kid ? " And gritting his teeth against the pressure in his chest he sent the plane howling down at the green chaos , the treetops  | spinning and the brown river leaping upward and out to the side  --  an orange slough , white birds like giant flowers , green ? hauling back again , eyes shut , and the pain of terror like hot wire in his chest  --  he had cut it- too close  --  then a rush of leaves , the nose of the plane against the sky : Wolfie 's livid face intent on him , teeth bared , Wolfic bracing himself with his feet , keeping the knife neatly in place with his left hand while with his right he hauled instinctively at his own wheel ; in a moment he would try to kill Moon and take over the dual controls . But on the rise , the plane snapping and shuddering like a kite , Moon rolled it violently to the right , knocking Wolfie back , and plunged again , at the river this time , pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to roar along beneath high branches , so that for a moment of horror it seemed as if they had entered a tunnel of swarming green ; then he broke for the sky again , climbing steadily at an angle so steep that ' Wolfie , seeing that a stall was imminent , did not make his move . Wolfic tried to shout , and when he found he could not speak , removed the knife from his companion 's throat and tapped a small metal plate on the controls , the manufacturer 's plate that read , THIS AIRCRAF " 1 ' N ( YC ' CERTIFIED FOR ACROBATICS . Then the colors of oblivion whirled about their heads , and when they came out again Wolfic did not raise the knife . He was shaking his head sadly ; the rage that had filled the tiny cabin shrank to an injured muttering . He had trouble clearing his throat . " You wan na commit suicide is fine by me , only just swing past Madre first , and let the Old Wolf bail out . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ai n't like you . I ai n't mad at life , Moon . I ai n't got no lousy death wish . " As he spoke he toyed with the side window , but his hand shook so that he was helpless . He did not seem to notice that Moon had leveled off and was flying normally . " This knife always brought me luck , " he said . " I had it made up special one time , down in Mexico . " " Keep it , " Moon said . His heart was pounding so that he felt sick , and his legs , like two plastic tubes of water , were all but useless on the pedals . On the airstrip at Madre de Dios they sat stunned in the  | plane for several minutes , unable to move . The people gathered around the plane at a little distance , the barefoot men , the barefoot women , the dogs and children , all of them remorseless in their curiosity . " Do not feed the lunatics , " Wolfie said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to laugh loudly and violently , until the tears poured down their cheeks . Not yet able to face each other , they sat there shoulder to shoulder in the stifling heat of the small cabin . The bystanders withdrew a little , and they laughed a little harder ; then , as suddenly as they had begun , they stopped laughing and crawled out of the plane . In silence they refilled the empty tanks by siphoning gas from the drums on the rickety platform , then locked the cabin , and in the haze of the dead sun , staggered off toward the town . The people , who had sighed and poked one another at the sight of Moon 's bloody throat , fell into line behind them . Moon searched for a way to make amends . Because he was still angry about the knife , he started by saying sourly , " So you think I 'm an anti-Semite , huh ? " " Nah , not really . " Wolfie said . " You 're anti-everything . But I 'm an anti-goy , confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's hard to find a Jewish lunatic . " Moon grinned , but Wolfie 's own smile was dispirited . He walked stiffly , in a kind of shock , and his face was sad . For the first time that Moon could remember , his partner did not feel like talking , and as his own head began to clear , he realized that Wolfie 's terror in the plane had been fed less by fear of death than by bewilderment at Moon 's contempt for both their lives , by the threat of a totally meaningless end . When Wolfie had recovered from his shock , from his fatigue and hangover as well as from the experience of the morning , he would deeply resent what had been done to him and especially the careless way in which Moon had told him that he could keep his knife . Eventually he would doubt that he had ever seriously intended to kill Moon , and that Moon had known this all along and had humiliated him anyway . Then he would question his own courage and find some excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of Moon .  | Even this one , Moon concluded , glancing at the violent man beside him . Even this one must be handled like a baby . His mind strayed back to the strange sights of the morning ; he wanted to think about what he had seen and why it had so excited and unsettled him . To Quarrier , who stared at his bloody shirt from the salon doorway , he refused conversation , saying enigmatically , " Nice country , " and continuing upstairs . Wolfie lay down on his bed without taking off his boots and fell asleep , a surprised expression on his face , mouth slightly open , and the handle of his knife protruding like an iron nose between the buttons of his twisted shirt . Moon sank down slowly on the edge of the other bed and contemplated the round face and the roistering beard , the inseparable earring and dark glasses and beret like grotesque toys , the knife made specially down there in Mexico . In all the time that he had known this man he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use , and the fact that Wulfie had gone to sleep without sliding its sheath beneath his arm was the bleakest evidence of his defeat and new dependence . He reached across and removed Wolfie 's beret . Wolfie 's hand flicked toward the knife , stopped , settled back upon his stomach . Ile sighed like a sleeping child . Moon nodded in regret . From now on , in some way , he was responsible for this human being ; the partnership was over . And though he knew that this new relationship could have come about at any time in their common past , he was sorry that it had happened . Since he himself would refuse responsibility for this man  --  for any man  --  he and Wolfie had better part company , and the sooner the better . He made the decision without turmoil ; he had made it before with other men and with twenty years of women . But the decision did not spare him sadness . A fine old kind of friendship had been killed , and a fine old freedom . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to this place before . He lay back on his bed and closed his eyes . He would go again to where men shot arrows at airplanes , but how , or even why , he did not know .  | A DOG TURNED IN ITS CIRCLE AND LAY DOWN IN THE SHADE , AND A vulture swung up and down in a short arc above the jungle , as if suspended from a string . In the heat of the siesta , the street below was hollow as a bone . He took the cork out of the bottle , and holding his breath to kill the bitterness , drank off half the brown fluid in a series of short gulps , gargling harshly when he was finished and spitting the residue into the street . The aftertaste made him gag . He sat down on the window sill and in a little while the nausea receded , leaving only a thick woody taste and a slight vagueness . A half-hour passed . Maybe the Indian had watered the infusion . A voice in the salon below sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his way . A little more ayahuasca , Mr. Moon ? He took up the bottle and drank off another quarter of it , then set it down very slowly . You 've made a bad mistake , he thought ; already he knew he did not need it . The effects were coming very suddenly , and he stood up and stalked the room . In overdose , he  | had read somewhere , the extract of Banisteriopsis caapi is quite poisonous and may bring on convulsions , shock and even death . Flow silent it was  --  the whole world was in siesta . He glanced quickly out the window , to take time by surprise ; the dog slept soundly , and the vulture still swung up and down its bit of sky , dark as a pendulum . From the far end of the street , a solitary figure was moving toward him , down the center of the street  --  the last man on earth . There you are , he thought , I have been waiting for you all my life . Now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pound and his breath was short . He went to his bed and lay down on his hack . Ile felt a closure of the throat and a tension in his chest , a metal bar from chin to navel to which the skin of his chest was sewn . Breathing became still more difficult , and a slight pain in the back of his head became a general , diffused headache . I lc turned cold and his teeth chattered ; the hands pressed to his face were limp and clammy . I am ( lying all apart , he thought ; at the same time his chest constricted ever more tightly . Let go , he told himself aloud . Let go . He rolled over on his side and blinked at the other bed . The man on the bed retreated from his vision , shrinking and shrinking until he was no bigger than a fetus . Color : the room billowed with it ; the room breathed . When he closed his eyes , the color dazzled him ; he soared . But there was trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in heavy spasmodic leaps , that it must surely stall and die . He broke into a sweat , and his hands turned cold as small bags of wet sand .. . He sat up , aching , in a foreign room . He could breathe again , although his heart still hurled itself unmercifully against his chest : how thin a man 's poor chest was , after all ; it was as thin as paper , surrounding a hollow oval space of wind and bitterness . Thump , thump-ump , urn-thump ; it would crash through at any minute , and what then ? Do I greet it ? Introduce myself ? How long can a man sit holding his heart in his hands ? Or was that thump coming from elsewhere ? The thump of a bed  --  were the missionaries making love ? The male missionary  | making love to the female missionary ? The Courtship of Missionaries : the male missionary , larger and more splendidly plumaged than his shy dowdy mate , hurls his head back joyfully and sings " Praise the Lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and mounting in a decorous and even pious manner , inserts his tongue into her right ear .. You are the Lost Tribe of Israel , and therefore you must pray especially hard , for the Lost Tribe of Israel is under God 's everlasting curse . Do you understand ? Why do n't you answer me ? What is the matter with you children  --  do you wish to remain accursed ? Now you answer me , Lewis Moon , or I 'm going to beat you . Lewis ? Lewis ! Now his body cavity felt hollowed out as if cold sterile winds were blowing through it . . . loss , loss , loss . Loss . Look into the sky and think of nothing , said Alvin Moon " Joe Redcloud , " but do not look into the sun , for the sun will blind you .

He was not like the old men , nor even like his father ; he spoke American and raised the American flag at school ; he wore blue jeans and looked at magazines in stores and stood around outside the movie in the town , searching his pockets as if he had real money ; and he did not believe in visions . Like all the children , he killed his hunger at the mission house on Sunday and afterward felt ashamed . Once he went hungry , telling the missionary that Cheyennes never ate on Sundays . He remained on the rock a second day and a second night , just out of stubbornness , and because he was proud of the rifle that Alvin Moon had laid beside him . No bear nor cougar came ? the animals would not bother him , his father said , if he sat still ? and on the third morning he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun and wind blow through him . He was as firmly rooted in the ground as the young pine .  | By afternoon he was growing weak and became filled with apprehension : something was happening . The jays and squirrels had lost all fear of him , flicking over and about him as if he had turned to stone , and the shrill of insects crystallized in a huge ringing silence . The sky was ringing , and the pine trees on the rocks turned a bright rigid green , each needle shimmering ; the pines were ringing and beside him a blue lupine opened , breathing . Then the river turned to silver and stopped flowing . The jays trembled on the rock , their eyes too bright , and the squirrel was still , the gold hairs flowing on its tail . He stared at the enormous sky , and the ski- descended and the earth was rising from below , and he was soaring toward the center Then , in the ringing , far away , rose a flat droning . The airplane unraveled the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever appearing , and when it had gone , the sky no longer rang . Ile sat a long time on his rock , but the sky had risen , leaving him desolate . Light-headed , he went down to the river , where he drank . He found mushrooms and fresh-water mussels , and some berries , and when he had eaten he laughed at his three-day vigil , pretending that he did not feel a dreadful sorrow . On the fourth day , waiting for Alvin Moon to come , he hunted . He killed a wild goose on the river , and boasted of it to his father . His father gazed at him . And where is the goose , his father said . I could not reach it , the boy said . It came so close , and then it drifted far away . HE reeled from the bed and drifted to the window , but the figure coming down the street was gone ; again he had missed some unknown chance . The street was void , a void , avoid . Dog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a vulture , nothing more , and thus We parted , sang Lenore . Singing . Somewhere , somewhere there was singing . His  | whole body shimmered with the chords , the fountainhead of music , overflowing . The chords were multicolored , vaulting like rockets across his consciousness ; he could break off pieces of the music , like pieces of meringue . You 're sleeping your life away , he told the dog . Do you hear me ? I said , Do you hear me ? Meri-wether , Sheriff Guzman said . That 's some name for a red nigger , ai n't it ? You 're the smart one , ai n't you kid ? Ai n't you supposed to be the smart Cheyenne ? Done good in the war , and now they gone to send they little pet Christ-lovin Cheyenne to college , ai n't that right , kid ?

Do not fight so much . You come back and see us now . Alas , too late  --  the world is dead , you sleepyhead . The Inn of the Dog and the Vulture . There are voices , you see , then singing voices , then strange musics , hollowed out , as if drifted through a wind tunnel , these followed by a huge void of bleak silence suggesting DEATH . THE STORY OF MY LIFE , by Lewis Moon . Now . . . something has happened , was happening , is happening . BUT WILL NOT HAPPEN . Do you hear me ? I said , DO YOU HEAR ME ? A softer tone , please . To begin at the beginning : my name is Meriwether Lewis Moon . Or is that the end ? Again : I was named Meriwether Lewis Moon , after Meriwether Lewis , who with Lieutenant William Clark crossed North America without killing a single Indian . So said my father ; my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on North Mountain . Alvin Moon still traps and hunts , and in World War I , when still a despised non-citizen , exempt from service , joined those 16,999 other Indians as insane as himself who volunteered to serve in World War I. Alvin Moon is half-Cheyenne ; he went down South when he came home and took up with a Creole Choctaw woman named Big Irma and  | brought her back up to his mountain . The worst mistake that Alvin Moon ever made was trying to educate himself ; his information about Lewis and Clark was the only piece of education he ever obtained , and it was wrong . He used to joke that he could n't educate himself unless he learned to read , and how could he learn to read if he did n't educate himself ? So he left off hunting and trapping and came down off his mountain and took work near the reservation to keep his children in the mission school , to give them a better chance in life . I ai n't got nothin , said Joe Redcloud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the hell of it is , I broke my back , paid out every cent , to keep then kids into that school , and now they do n't know no thin , neither , only Jesus Christ . Now ai n't that somethin ? They sit around here thinkin about Godamighty , I reckon , while they 're waitin on their gover'ment reliefs . All but Meriwether Lewis . Again : my name is Lewis Moon , and I am lying on a bed ( deathbed ? ) in a strange country , and I hear eerie voices and a crack is appearing on the wall , wider and wider , and the bulb in the ceiling is growing more and more bulbous , and will surely explode  --  a crack ( of doom ? ) of lightning down the walls . The extract of B. caapi is a powerful narcotic and hallucinogen containing phenol alkaloids related to those found in lysergic acid , and whether or not it finds a respectable place in the pharmaceutica of man , it has held for unknown centuries an important place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the time of my experiment I was lying in a narrow room with a corpse in the next bed , with God , a vulture and a dog as witnesses , wishing that Marguerite were here . Marguerite . I wish to tell Marguerite that the reason I did not make love to her that time in Hong Kong was not because I did not want her but because I had reason to believe that in the late , low hours of the week before , I had contracted a low infestation . I did not know Marguerite well enough to give her crabs  --  you understand ? Marguerite had alabaster skin , triumphant hair , and an unmuddied soul , and a swinging little ass into the bargain .  | You listen to me , Meriwether Lewis : what the hell you sass that Sheriff for ? He mighta kilt you . You stay clear of whiskey , then ; long as you ca n't stay out of trouble , you ai n't welcome back . And do n't you show your Mam that bad face , neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll whup you again , hero or no hero . Alvin Moon " Joe Redcloud " said , You 're all your people here got left to count on . You go get that education , hear me now ? And then you come on home and learn it back to us as best you can . Because the way things are goin they ai n't no hope for none of us , lessen we do n't get somethin learned here to us pretty quick . I have opened my eyes again , to shut off all that blue . Color can threaten , overwhelm , whirling like that  --  an ant in a kaleidoscope might sense the problem . But out here the bed shudders , the chair sneaks , the bureau budges ; they back and fill , about to charge . From above the bulb socket descends like a falling spider , leaving the bulb behind . B. caapi , which is named for the caapi of certain Brazilian Indians , is also the camorampi of the Campa , the natema of the Jivaro , the ayahuasca or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the soga de muerte of most Spanish South Americans , names variously translated as " Vine of the Devil , " " Vine of the Soul , " " Vine of Death " : the Spanish term means literally " vine rope of death , " the soga referring to the jungle lianas used commonly as canoe lines , lashings , ropes , etc . In addition to certain medical properties , the vine can induce visions , telepathic states , metaphysical contemplation and transmigration ; these conditions are used by the Indians for the reception of warnings , prophecies and good counsel . Among many tribes one purpose of the dream state is identification of an unknown enemy , and the use of it is thus related to the Jivaro practice of taking tsantsas , or shrunken heads . . . I am cut off , I feel both silly and depressed ; it is the solitude , not solitude but isolation . . . Death is the final isolation , but from what , from what ? I am trying to reach out to you , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see you . I only feel your presence in this room . Perhaps ... I wonder ... are you inside me ? And if so . . . Now listen carefully : There is a lost reality , a reality lost long ago . Are you in touch with it : can you tell me  --  did you see ? ? the man with the blue arrow Or . . . or are you the figure in the center of the street ? So you came here , after all ! Can you hear me ? I said , CAN YOU HEAR ME ? CAN  --  YOU  --  I LIAR  --  ME ! I can not reach him through the sound and silence , distant sound and deepest silence , like a thick glass barrier between the world of the living and myself , as if I were wandering on an earth which had suddenly died , or in a Purgatory , myself already dead . There is something that you have to understand . Now look what 's happening  --  can you see ? It 's Him , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not suspecting that I am already dead , he will attempt to kill me. lie speaks : StopshoutinforChristsake ! Here he comes , intent on the kill . He has broken the glass wall . I Ic drags nic across the room . He has a costume , he is all dressed up like a soldier of fortune , he is very hip ; but see the rosy checks behind that beard ? An enormous child ! " You are an I  --  normous Child ! " **30;541;TOOLONG ! **33;573;TOOLONG ? Gowanlookatyaself ! See that pale face in the glass ! The face is rigid , and the eyes are dark and huge . Over the left eye drifts a dark shadow , like a hand . There you arc , I sec you now , and the bearded man , your warder . He knew his lucidity could not last , and because he had taken too much , he dreaded going under again , and he started to ask Wolfie for help . " Hey , " he said . But he could not ask , he had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , what could poor Wolfie do ? There were no sedatives in Madre de Dios ; sedation was superfluous in a graveyard . He pushed away and tottered toward the window , where he fell across the sill . The dog and the vulture were gone . The light was tightening in the way it always  | did before the sudden jungle night , and down the center of the street a solitary figure walked away . The bottle stood upon the sill ; he drank it to the bottom . HE felt like crying , but did not . He had not cried in twenty years  --  no , more . Had he ever cried ? And yet he did not really feel like crying ; he felt like laughing , but did not . Stalking Joe Redcloud 's shack as twilight came , he waited to be called back , beaten , and forgiven , but with the clear prairie darkness came the knowledge that the call would never come , that the days of tears and comfort had come and gone before he had realized they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sagebrush for a little while , and then moved off like a lean yearling grizzly driven snarling from the cave , feeling very bad and very good at the same time , and spoiling for a fight . He crouched beside the window sill , his back to the world without , and far away he heard them coming , the marching of huge nameless armies coming toward him , and once again his hands turned cold . He felt very cold . On the wall of the room , over the door , he saw a huge moth with a large white spot on each wing . It palpitated gently ; he could hear the palpitations , and the spots were growing . And there was a voice , a hollow voice , very loud , and very far away , calling through glass , and there were hands on him and he was shaken violently . The voice rose and crashed in waves , rolling around his ears ; it was getting dark . **47;608;TOOLONG ? AwrightLewis ? I saidAWRIGHTLEWIS ? He looked at the man and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrank before his eyes and became a tsantsa . He could not look , and turned away . A figure crossed his line of vision , moving toward the door . The door opened and light came in . The voice said **29;657;TOOLONG . Do n't go . . . I need ... Do n't go . I need . . . But he could not hear his own voice , and he could not have said just what he needed . From over the man 's head the large white eyes of the  | moth observed him ; they pinned him , like incoming beams . The music crashed , the wave . . . The door was dark again . He pushed himself to his feet and stared out of the window . The dark was rolling from the forest all around , and the sky was so wild as the sun set that it hurt his eyes . He reeled and fell , then thrashed to his feet and fell again , across the bed , and was sucked down into the darkness as the music burst the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through cathedral vaults of color , whirling and shimmering and bursting forth , drifting high among the arches , down the clerestories , shadowed by explosions of stained glass . In the dark chapels of the church was a stair to windy dungeons , to colors rich and somber now , and shapes emerging ; the shapes flowered , rose in threat and fell away again . Fiends , demons , dancing spiders with fine webs of silver chain . A maniac snarled and slavered , and rain of blood beat down upon his face . Teeth , teeth grinding in taut rage , teeth tearing lean sinew from gnarled bone . Idiocy danced hand in hand with lunacy and hate , rage and revenge ; the dungeon clanked and quaked with ominous sounds , and he kept on going , down into the darkness SNOW , dawn , black aspens . The creature rose at the boy 's coming and somersaulted backward , whining and snarling , the trap clatter muffled in white silences ; whiteness ; the blood pools colored black , the tight-sewn cold . A great head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last wolf in the mountains , the first and only wolf the boy had ever seen . He had no rifle . The old wolf leaped , to drive him back , and fell forward on its muzzle , which rose white-tipped from the snow ; its tongue fell out . The icy steel worked tighter on its foreleg , and the pain confused it , for it looked aside and wagged its tail a little , shivering . Then , just once , it howled a real wolf howl , pure as the black air of the mountain forest . Then it lay down . It had been gnawing on its foreleg , just above where the trap had snapped , and now it began again , whining and snarling at  | its own agony , at the stubbornness of its own bone which held it earthbound . The mad yellow eyes watched him , the taut muzzle , the purplish curled gum , red teeth , the jaw ; the scrape of teeth on living bone made him cry out . The ears flicked forward , but the gnawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprang sideways ; another such spring might free it . He drew back , frightened of the mad wild yellow eyes . The sun rose to low banks of winter clouds ; the day grew cold . He cut a sapling and carved a spear point , long and white ; confronting the wolf , he drove the raw white wood into its chest as it came up at him and fought to pin it to the ground and grind the pain out of it . But still it fought to live , dull heavy thumps in the white flying powder ; a blood fleck seared his lip  --  the wolf was snapping at the place where the stake pierced it . Shaken free , he had fallen within reach of it , but the stunned creature only raised its bleeding teeth from its own wounds and stared at him and past him , blinked once at the dying winter world , in daze , and lay its head upon its forepaws , panting . He opened his eyes , gasping for breath ; he drifted downward . Once the abyss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papier-mache angels , and again he broke off chords of music from the air like bits of cake : the Paradise was false and he went on . A spider appeared , reared high over his head , then seized , shredded and consumed him . Voided , he lay inert in a great trough , with molten metal rising all about him in a blinding light . SO THIS WAS BRIMSTONE . The missionary 's pasty face peered down at him over the rim : This is a proud day for the mission , Lewis , and a proud day for your people . We all count on you . Eyes . Eyes . He struggled to free himself , but the stake held in his heart , the hole in his heart ; even breathing hurt him , even breathing . He clawed at his own chest to ease it . If only he could get that pain out , then his heart would bleed his life away , but gently .  | A ROAR of trapped insects , flies and bees , and he among them : mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraping toward remote slits of air and light , of acrid insect smell , of flat inconscient insect eyes , unblinking , bright as jewels , too mindless to know fear , oh Christ , how mindless . Humans . . . A human mob , pounding its way into the bar , in search of  --  what ? It did not know . It had no idea what it was hunting , but was hunting out of instinct , with myriad flat insect eyes , trampling everything underfoot ; he shook with fear . Like a rat he was , a famine rat of broken cities , a quaking gut-shrunk rat , scurrying through the wainscoting of falling houses . His skeleton flew apart , reassembled in rat 's skeleton ; his spine arched , the tiny forefeet and long furtive hand , the loose-skinned gassy belly ; he poised , alert , hunched on his knees upon the bed , hands dangling at his navel , long nose twitching . In the mirror across the room he saw the hair sprout on his face and the face protrude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely into the glass that his nose touched it ; he watched the face wrinkle and turn old ; he saw his own raw skull again and groaned . Then another mask , a new expression , hard and sly and cold . As he watched , it softened and turned young and wide-eyed , gentle ; the muscles in his stomach eased , and he recognized the self of boyhood mornings . I le was touched by this last face and grinned at it in embarrassment ; but just as he grinned , self-consciousness returned to poison him , and the boyish face turned hard again and mean , and the lips drew back upon sharp teeth and the eyes glittered , and the whole body tensed with an anger of such murderous black violence that he recoiled from his own hate , falling back again across the bed . A huge dead dog had its teeth locked in his throat , and the metal bar dragged at his chest again , and when he closed his eyes the Rage descended , a huge and multilimbed galoot in hobnailed boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploding in its mouth and flames shooting from its ears , bearing a club spiked with rusty nails , wearing brass knuckles and outsize six guns ; in its blind snot-flying rage , it blew its own head off by mistake . This thing came stomping down out of his mind , and he gasped ,  | Look at that guy , that guy is so mad , he blew his own head off by mistake ! His body relaxed and he howled with laughter , lying now with his back on the floor and his feet on the bed , and as he laughed , the gnawed and painful stake which had pierced his chest as long as he could remember cracked and opened like an ancient husk and turned to dust , and he could breathe again . With the music rising in the summer breeze there came a gay preposterous parade along the highroad : calliope flutings and fanfare , with band wagons and floats and maelstroms of confetti , pouter pigeons and emerald parakeets , bursting drums and golden tubas , and gauzy fat-cheeked majorettes in crotch-tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taut balloons ? oompa , oompa , oompa , oompa .

She wore a gigantesque plumed hat which she flew like a flag , and as the old tub pushed along , batting her eyes and swinging her butt , she leaked and sagged and oozed so woefully at the seams that rats and crows fought for her leavings , while in the front and alongside , as trumpets blew and pennants flew and children snickered and horses nickered , stores and provisions and water and fuel were crammed aboard ; varlets hurled up trays of tarts and heaved up meats and slung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran to pump in gasoline and air , barely able to offset the waste and loss of the vast outpourings beneath  --  Big Irma meanwhile , nothing daunted , leering and winking to beat hell , and curtseying prettily as the bands played and hats were tossed and wild cheers rent the air hip hip hurroo and winking her blinkers and twinking her pinkie and twirling a tiny parasol , all giggling and goosed and poked , as if to say , Well , sweet Christ knows I always done my damndest.  | ONCE upon a time , at morning , a small blood-silver river in 1 the rising plains , the silver undersides of wind-awakened leaves , j the silver spider webs in dew .

He lay there all laughed out and loose , loose as a dead snake slung on a rail , lay there drunk with gentleness and pleasure . Be a good boy , Lewis , do not hate so much . Oh good old Wolfie , Wolfie would die laughing . The thought of the Old Wolf laughing , dying of laughing , set him off again , but this time , even as he laughed , an apprehension came . He crawled to the corner of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . The noises were surrounding him , there was something happening to him , something happen- ing , and he felt too tired now to deal with it . If he could only stop this laughing , but he could not ; his laughter grew louder and louder , and when he tried to stop he could not close his mouth . It stretched wider and wider , until he swallowed the ceiling light , the room , the window and the night ; the world rushed down into the cavernous void inside him , leaving him alone in space , pinwheeling wildly like a jagged fragment spun out from a planet . A terrific wind blew , and his cars rang with the bells of blueblack space ; the wind scaled his throat , his flesh turned cold , his screams were but squeaks snapped out and away by the passage of night spheres . Nor could he hear , there was no one to hear , there was no one where he had gone  --  what 's happening , what-ishappening .. . IIc had flung himself away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cold windy reaches of insanity . This perception was so clear and final that he moaned ; he would not find his way hack . You 've gone too far this time , you 've gone too far ... As he whirled into oblivion , his body cooled and became numb , inert , like a log seized up and borne out skyward by a cyclone ; he struggled to reach out , catch hold , grasp , grip , hang on , but he could not . Ile could not , he was made of wood , and there was nothing to hang on to , not even his own thought ? thought shredding , drifting out of reach , like blowing spider webs . He was gone , g-o-n-e , gone , G-O-N-E , gone  --  and around again . " I'hc howling was in his head , and all about lay depthless silence . I Lis screaming was ripped away before it left his mouth , and the mouth itself was far away , a huge papered hoop blown through and tattered by the gales . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lungs sucked tight , shriveled like prunes , collapsed . He died . Death came as a huge bounteous quiet , in the bosom of a high white cloud . The wood of his body softened , the knots loosened ; he opened up , lay back , exhausted , mouth slack , eyes wide like the bald eyes of a corpse . He glimpsed a hard light lucid region of his mind like a lone comet , wandering far out across the long night of the universe .  | " What are you doing ? " he whispered angrily . He was upset by his own nakedness . " You have n't any clothes on , " Moon remarked . " Is that a sin ? " The pupils of his eyes were very large , and both his face and voice were gentle . " Give me that dictionary ! " " No , not now . " He was already moving off unsteadily ; he disappeared into the stairwell . Quarrier ran back for his bathrobe , then went to fetch Wolfie . But Wolfie had found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | TOWARD DAWN LEWIS MOON CAME TO THE QUARRIERS ' ROOM . HE entered without knocking . Quarrier awoke in time to find Moon going through the pockets of his pants hung on the chair . Moon met his gaze calmly , still going through the pockets , and a moment later held up the Niaruna dictionary in the dim light . Quarrier slipped quietly from his bed and trailed Moon into the corridor . From the window Quarrier watched Moon drift down the center of the street to the edge of light and disappear into the darkness . Then he saw Andy running in the same direction . He started to call out to her , then stopped ; he ran to the doorway , to the stairwell , then back to his room . Quarrier was at his window when a climbing airplane roared over the hotel . In the jungle no one flew at night , and in the echoes of the plane 's motor a tension swelled , a taut silence , cracked like glass by the sound of a first voice , which told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town , a moment later , he heard Wolfie howling . By sunrise all of Madre de Dios had convened to stare at the spot where the airplane had been . Guzman himself came , in his private car , with driver . Everyone had an ear cocked for an engine , but everyone also seemed to know that Moon would not come back . Nevertheless , I luben went over to the radio shack to try to contact Moon . Almost immediately the flyer 's voice resounded , but Leslie was unable to tell how long Moon had been talking . Apparently the man had no audience in mind , for the monologue was in English . Who was he talking to , then ? Leslie did not catch all of it , and in fact made no real contact ; he was paid for his efforts in curses and strange maledictions . It was now known that Moon was under the effects of ayahuasca , and the wonder was that on this rough mud strip , without lights of any kind , he had got into the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another that he had feigned the ayahuasca , that he had made off with the plane , leaving the Bearded One to fend for himself . Others stated flatly that under the spell of the Vine of Death , Moon had divined the location of Paititi , the legendary El Dorado , and had gone there , suicidally alone , to add his bones to those of all such jungle visionaries . Wolfie , meanwhile , cornered Guzman , and using Quarrier as his interpreter , demanded the use of the old army fighter as a search plane . Guzman said that it did not work , and when Wolfie said that he would fix it , the Comandante shrugged . He jeered as Wolfie ran off with tools and gasoline toward the plane on the far  | side of the strip ; it sat in growth up to its fuselage . But soon Wolfie was seen leaping up and down , cranking the prop by hand . The plane did not respond , and the squat figure scrambled back under the cowling and dove down once again into the works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could start the plane , which had been famous for its treacherous and ugly disposition , and had not left the ground in more than a year . But an hour later the Bearded One was again swinging violently on the prop , and after a few dreadful coughs the airplane belched a cloud of smoke and came to life with a clatter of outraged metal . Wolfie ran back across the strip , shouting wildly through the black grease on his face . " Gas ! " he bellowed at the Comandante . " Gim me some more gas ! " But Guzman shook his head . " Mecanico , si , " he grinned . " Piloto , no . " He could scarcely turn over the property of his government to someone who owed him money . " You got my passport , do n't you ? Look , I 'll bomb them Indians myself ! " Wolfie made war whoops by patting his open mouth , then made violent bombing motions . The Comandante was amused . He laughed : " Ha , ha , ha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy , " Wolfie told Quarrier . " I shoulda done it the other night . You tell him to get that crate gassed up and oiled and do it quick , or I 'm goin to knife him right here and now in front of all his friends . " Speaking quietly , he kept his gaze on Guzman 's face , and El Comandante did not wait for the translation . " Pigs ! " he shouted at his soldiers , who were standing there half dressed and unarmed , scratching at dirty undershirts . " You dare to come before me out of uniform ! You will be punished ! " He whirled in fury and singled out his driver . " Mechanic ! " He spat violently in contempt . " You saw ? The gringo fixed a motor faster than you can wipe my windshield ! Now prepare the plane for this true mechanic and do it quickly ! " He turned again to Wolfie and bowed slightly from the waist . Wolfie grinned into his face , disdainfully . " He 's chicken , ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's chicken through and through . " He watched as Guzman 's driver , shouting violent or- ders in his turn , directed the soldiers toward the drums of gasoline . " Maybe he knows the plane is n't safe , " Quarrier said . " That 's what he thinks , all right ; look at that miserable face ! But there ai n't nothin wrong with that old heap except only maintenance . That 's like what I hate about this lousy continent ? no maintenance . Valves stuck , fouled plugs , and every other wire loose , but that 's a good old swingin , practically brand-new American engine . And just as soon as I get rid of them bushmasters and tarantulas and all the other jungle crud which this is prolly layin around the cockpit , the 01 ( 1 Wolf is goin to be air-borne . " He shook his head . " 1 hat crazy Moon . He 's pulled plenty of cute tricks , but this one ? " Ile threw his arms wide apart and staggered back , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he want I should start , even , answer me that . And not a lousy chart , even , and somewhere out there on a sand bar on one of them miserable rivers , prolly layin on his ass eatin mangoes , this stupid drugged-up bastard is waitin for his buddy Wolf to come and rescue him . And I ca n't even land when I do find him ? " He barked with exasperation , but the sound had a slight ring of despair . Wolfie blinked a little , shocked ; his face turned red in consternation , as if he were facing the probability that his friend was dead . " If I were you , 1 'd try the Niaruna country first , " Quarrier said . " Sure , sure . Like , where is it ? " " To the east . You were there yesterday . " Andy Huben was standing just behind them . " That 's right , " she said . " He was going eastward . " She looked pale and tense . " What is all this eastward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and out , summoning the halfbreeds as his witnesses . " The marks all know exactly where he went , and his own pal Wolf did n't even know that he was goin ! " Huben hurried over . " Are you cursing at my wife ? " he said . " So who 's cursin ! What I 'm tryna find out is how in sweet Christ does she know he headed eastward ! "  | Now all three stared at her . " He told me . " " When did he tell you ? " Huben said . " Last night  --  I mean , this morning . Just before he left . " " Oy ! " Wolfie cried , delighted . " Very good . I musta been sheltered as a yout ' or somethin , I thought you people ? " He jerked his thumb at Quarrier , then tossed his chin toward Andy . " First him and that Indian chick , and now it 's her and Lewis ? " Andy slapped him hard across the face , and her husband came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bobbing and weaving . But the people , moaning , pressed so close that Leslie was restricted in his maneuvers and finally came to a halt . He was red to the point of bursting , and when he spoke , his voice was high with rage . " You take that back ! " " Or else ? " Grinning , a bad glint in his eye , Wolfie slowly withdrew his hand from inside his shirt ; he raised the hand slowly and pinched at Huben 's face . A moment later , when he withdrew it , there was blood between his thumb and forefinger . Huben paled , and the people gasped . " Big mos-quito , " Wolfie enunciated . He grinned at Quarrier and winked . To Huben he said , " I was only foolin wit ' you , Reverend . Like maybe you 're kind of emotionally upset  --  I mean , you know , neurotic possessiveness , right , Reverend ? Only do n't come prancin around the Old Wolf again like that or you 're liable to get fractured . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were asleep . I thought he was on his way to bomb and kill . I ran after him and begged him not to attack the Niaruna . " She turned toward her husband . " He promised he would n't . " " Promised ! " Huben shook , in a fury of emotions . " What were you wearing ? " Quarrier said quickly , " Did he say anything else ? " " He said some other things . I 'm not sure I understood them . " Her husband seized her by the arm . " Come on , Andy , we 're going back to the hotel . " " Well , you accomplished what we could n't , " Quarrier called  | after her . Without turning , Andy raised her hand in a small fluttering wave , and both Quarrier and Wolfie laughed . " She 's a swinger , ai n't she ? " Wolfie said . But Leslie took their laughter as liI directed at himself , and glared over his shoulder . At this , Wolfie snarled and cursed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was worrying once more about his partner . " Eastward , huh ? " I lc rolled his eyes . " Eastward , the man says . " He waved his arm in a half-circle . " You ca n't miss it , right ? " I-le slammed his big fist into his other hand . " Well , nuts to that . I 'll get him out all right , one way or another  --  all I got ta do is find him . Lewis and me , we been in trouble worse than this , a lot worse . " Wolfic flew our an hour later , after going back to the hotel for his pistol , which lie wore strapped to his hip . " So what 's it to ya , " he said to 1 Iubcn , who , standing in the hotel doorway , had glanced at the weapon in disdain . " You think it 's some kind of a sex symbol , or what ? Maybe I wan na shoot myself a vulture . " The crowd at the airstrip cheered El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muy macho , hombre ! " ? saluting the beard and ( the gold earring , the mechanical genius and the revolver . It was commonly assumed , and confirmed by the infernal clatter of the I ' engine , that El Lobo would disappear in the wake of Moon and die a hero 's death before the sun had set . " Introit et Kyrie ... " Quarrier turned . Here was the priest again ; he had not even noticed him . Xantes was everywhere , hands folded behind his back , observing . " So . . . the Requiem commences . Inevitable , eh ? And I , for one , will miss him . Such a strange man , this Moon ! A soldier of fortune , and of the classic type , and yet  --  how shall I say ? There 1 was something likable about the man , did you not find ? " " He 's dead , you mean ? " " Do you not think so ? " Xantes cocked his head . " Y usted ? I understand that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the laws of this land , for example ? ? " Quarrier laughed ; they walked on a little way together . " Oh  | yes , I love to read . I wish I could read Spanish well enough to borrow ? " He stopped short . " By all means ; one must do what one can to help dispel ignorance . " Quarrier knew that he was being jeered at , and he particularly disliked being jeered at in a kindly manner . But the priest was too adroit for him , and he exclaimed , " But why are you sympathetic to Moon ! These men are mercenaries , very probably criminals . . . " " How is it , then , that we pass so much of our time in talk of him ? Do you deny it ? If he is the ordinary bandit he appears to be , why can we not dismiss him ? Surely you have noticed , Senor Quarrier , that the people we dismiss most vehemently are the very ones we find it necessary to dismiss most often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banditry of the late Moon that so unsettles us . We all sit up , we call old names at him ; we can not be comfortable while he is there . Yet we circle in uneasily  --  what is his secret , what does this man wish to know that we do not ? " He paused to cough . " And now , alas , he is gone away , and with him some sort of  --  possibility ? For all of us . " Xantes smiled , bowed , and set out toward the town . " What is it you want with me ? " Quarrier called , despairing , and the priest turned toward him , his brown cassock snapping in the dull wind of the airstrip . " I would talk to you , Senor Quarrier , even if I had no better reason than the following : I have learned all of my English out of books , and I speak it very well , do you not think ? But I have not many chances to practice it , and so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He smiled gaily and bowed again . " Good day , senor . " WoLFIE was back while the sun was still high , careening down to a bad landing , out of gas ; he took off a second time as soon as he had refueled . He left again at dawn the following morning and flew until dark , and he did this again on the following day , the  | page deleted  | page deleted  | Alone ! She was alone  --  they 'd left a sick person to walk alone ! Whimpering , she picked up her skirt as Momma used to , crossing the barnyard in the rain ; she began to run , crying and laughing at her own fright , at the big frightened white knees pumping along . But there , the folks had stopped , and seeing their stern faces , she hastened to compose herself . " Goodness , wait for me ! " she called out gaily , as if she were carrying the picnic basket . Their silence was awkward  --  did they think her too forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodness , I forgot about that min/1 , " she sighed , twirling a little . " This is surely the domain of Satan , Mr. Huben , I can smell sulphur in the very air ! " I , cslie cried out , " Why , that vomit smell , that 's the sawmill , hazel , you remember that ! Why heck , you wo n't hardly call that a smell at all once you smell Remate de Males ! Culmination of Evils ' ! I low 's that for the name of a town ? " Awaiting her reaction , young Mr. Ruben glanced uneasily at Mr. Quarrier . Their uncertainty gave her a grip on herself ? she would confound them . " I reckon it 's as good a name as any , " she said primly , " in this neck of the woods . " Now Martin Quarrier laughed boisterously in relief , this coarse-looking fellow who imagined that he understood what he was pleased to call Miss Hazel 's " quirky " sense of humor . But she had not fooled that child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if skirting some ominous beast . They almost nodded at each other . I know , his face said . You have gone away again . You have forsaken us . Yo-yo had been sent to contact the Niaruna ; he returned a week later with word that the plane had crashed and that Lewis Moon was dead . How had he died ? Yoyo shrugged and smiled . He knew no more . Wolfie , once he had understood ? " What 's he sayin , c'm on , what 's he sayin ? " ? picked Yoyo off the ground and shook him like a rat . " Since when do n't a bush pilot follow the rivers ? Huh ? And if he piled up along the rivers , I woulda found him  --  I seen every lousy river from here to Bolivia and halfway across Brazil . So where 's the aircraft , huh ? Where  --  is  --  the  --  aircraft ? "  | But Yoyo did not answer , not out of recalcitrance but because he spoke no English ; instead he smiled enthusiastically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind , he had learned early in the game that gringos  --  and especially the evangelicos  --  responded favorably to eagerness of any kind . When Wolfie 's question was translated for him , he smiled again . It was true that he , Yoyo , had not seen the wreckage ; it was far off  --  he pointed vaguely eastward . The plane , he said , had disappeared in the far country of the Yuri Maha , the People to the East . The Yuri Maha , he explained , were of the same clans as the Niaruna , but now nobody went that way ; the trails were lost . Wolfie lowered him to the ground , but he kept his big hands clenched for a few moments on the front of the red shirt , glaring at Yoyo and breathing harshly , as if considering how best to dispose of him once and for all . Leslie talked with Yoyo separately , but made no more headway than had Wolfie with this flexible personality ; it seemed quite possible that Yoyo had gone no farther than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it as dramatic and final as he could in an attempt to please his listeners . Leslie did learn , however , that his own small band of Niaruna was most anxious that he return , as they were under constant threat of violence from their wild brethren and had been forced to take shelter in Remate de Males . A few days later the Hubens flew out to Remate , leaving the Quarriers to wait for the supplies .  | AT THE FNO OF IIIS LONG NIGHT OF UPROAR AND HALLUCINATIONS , Lewis Moon had a dream . He dreamed that he walked homeward up the bed of an empty river and out onto a blasted land of rusted earth and hones and blackened stumps and stunted metal , a countryside of war . In the sky of a far distance he saw a bird appear and vanish ; but no matter how far he walked , the world was one mighty industrial ruin , a maze of gutted factories and poisoned ground tinder the gray sky . He came finally to a signpost , and the signpost had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward it , stumbled , fell and ran again . The signpost pointed eastward , back toward the sun , and it read : NOWHERE Very tired , he turned back along his road , crossing the dead prairie . Though he had not noticed them on his outward journey , he now passed a series of signs all pointing eastward . Each was illuminated by a ray of sun , and each bore the same inscription :  | The terrible silence of the world made him move faster , and soon he saw , on the eastern horizon , the dark blur of a forest . He ran and trotted weakly , bewildered by the crashing of his feet upon the cinders . Another sign , and then another , pointed toward the wood . As he drew near , the wood became a jungle , a maelstrom of pale boles and thickened fleshy leaves , shining and rubbery , of high dark passages and hanging forms , of parasites and strangler figs and obscene fruited shapes . But even here there was no sound , no sign of movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sway the lianas ; there was only the mighty hush of a dead universe . He started forward , stopped , started again . Too frightened to go on , he turned around and saw what lay behind him ; then he sat down on the road , and this time he wept . When at last he lifted his eyes , he saw a signpost at the jungle edge ; it was obscured by weeds and leaves and the tentacle of a liana , and at first he thought that its inscription was identical to all the rest . But this sign did not point anywhere , and as he drew near and stared at it he saw that its inscription was quite different . It read : NOW HERE Astonished , he ventured on into the darkness of the jungle . Soon he came to a kind of clearing cut off from the sky by a canopy of trees , a soft round space like an amphitheater , diffused with sepia light . Everything was soft and brownish , and the ground itself quaked beneath his feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of the clearing he strayed into a quagmire ; very quickly he sank , too tired to struggle . But as he passed into the earth and the warm smells of its darkness , he was still breathing without effort , and soon he dropped gently into a kind of earthen vault . Though closed off from the sky , this cave was suffused by the same soft brownish light as in the clearing far above . Here was a second sign , which read :  | NOW HERE The passage through the soil had cleaned him of his clothes , and he was naked ; as he stood there , small black spots appeared in pairs upon his skin . I Ic pressed at them and discovered to his horror that the black spots were the tips of snail horns ; at each touch a naked snail slid uut through his skin and dropped to the cave floor . His hands flew wildly about his body , and the snails slid out and fell , until finally the earth at his bare feet was strewn with slimy writ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , numbers of salamanders crept forward ; each salamander grasped a snail behind its head and writhed in silent struggle with it , the soft bodies twitching back and forth in rhythm . I le hacked toward one side of the room and fell into a tunnel . He ran along the tunnel , no longer afraid , for there was light ahead . I-1c ran like a boy . The tunnel emerged like a swallow 's nest from the side of a high bank . Far below he saw a jungle clearing in a huge sunlight of the world 's first morning , and in the clearing the Indians awaited him . Naked , he leaped into the radiant air , and fell toward them . MooN awoke . He lay in a half-world between the dream and his narcosis , growing gradually aware of where he was . Though the room was dark , he could see the moth 's white eyes above the door , and the glint of the bottle on the window sill . The man on the next bed was missing . In the background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ringing in his ears . The night air of Madre de Dios was fragmented by insectsinging and far barking , by the tocking of frogs in the puddles and ditches , the murmur of voices behind walls , by sounds of breaking . But the street below was rigid in its silence , and he wondered if he was not still in the dream . He rose slowly ; though his head was light , he felt intensely strong and sure . There was no question in his mind about what he was going to do . He would not wait until it was light ; he would go now . He  | lifted his watch to his ear ; its tick was murderous . The numerals of the watch face , reading five-fifteen , glowed with chinks of light , as if time burning had been forced into the casing ; its metal swelled and shimmered with constraint . At this , his chest began to tighten , and his breathing hurt the cold wound in his heart ; he removed the watch , and holding it by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink until it broke . Then he dropped it out of the window . He moved quickly without turning on the light . From his knapsack he took the last of the river diamonds , holding them a moment in his hands . He had found these on the upper Paragua , in Venezuela , bright alluvial diamonds , burnished clean by mountain torrents , green and blue and yellow and red . In the darkness , he could feel them burning , like fire and water of the universe , distilled . He put one diamond in his pocket and slid the rest under Wolfie 's pillow . His revolver , in its shoulder holster , he put on beneath his shirt . An instinct nagged at him to leave the gun behind , to go forth unarmed and clean ; he slung it into a corner of the room . But after looking at it for a moment , his instinct weakened and he retrieved it . He went out of his room and down the hall to where the missionaries slept ; he opened the first door he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , his back to him , lay Leslie Huben . Beside Huben was the girl . He crossed the room and looked at her , the long hair on the pillow and soft mouth ; he could smell the warmth of her . When he reached down and ran his fingertips from the corner of her eye along her temple , her eyes opened , widened . Slowly her hands reached for the sheet and drew it to her chin . " Come with me , " he told her , neither softly nor loudly . She cried out faintly , like a child , which made him smile . She turned her head toward her husband , turned it back again . " No , " she whispered , " no , no , no . " He went out the door again and closed it . The next room was Martin Quarrier 's , and he found what he was looking for in the hip pocket of the missionary 's pants . Quarrier awoke and  | followed him out into the hall . The man talked on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice say , " No , not now . " He glanced back once as he turned down the stairs ; the girl was watching through the door crack . When she closed the door , he kept on going . He walked down the center of the empty street . On its last corner leaned a solitary man , a drunkard , attended by a dog . The drunkard was singing a sad slow mountain song , gasping for breath , lungs cracking . When Moon crossed his line of vision , he croaked , " Dr ndc vas , amigo ? " I-lc kept on singing while Moon stopped , swaying , and regarded him . The drunkard 's face waxed and waned , in caricature of idiocy , of rage and misery and innocence , of sensibility and soul . Ile sang softly out of his great mouth , his staring eyes and tear-eroded checks , his skull : " One buen de bailar Qrre buen de cantar . " Was this man the solitary figure coming at him down the street ? Moon said , " Yo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I'he man paused again , contemplating Moon . " Si , " Quieres venir ? " " No , gracias . " And then the man said gently , " Una copita , si ? ayahuasca , no . Buen viaje . " Moon emptied his pockets of his change and gave it to the singer . The man demurred : it was not Moon but the ayahuasca that made the gift . Moon said , " No , I no longer have need of it . " The man took it . " God will repay you , " he said ; he looked uncertain . Si , si . Dios le pagara . Moon walked on , his enlarged pupils drawing in the faintest light ; every sound and every smell enlivened him . In the nostrils of a lunatic , he thought , the night air is just as strong . . . In this moment he could scent , hunt out , run down and kill the swiftest creature on earth . Stalking the plane , he knew every sinew and muscle in his body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jungle night , he played cat , nerves taut , listening . He heard  | a small night animal and sprang for it , and was astonished when he missed it . An instant later he stopped breathing ; something was hunting him in turn . He drew the revolver and ducked under the plane , rising silently behind the intruder . The girl stood beside the wing . " Where are you going ? " her voice said . " Are you going to bomb the Niaruna ? " " No . " " You must not . " " No . " He laughed . He had not felt so happy since  --  since when ? " Are you sick ? You look so strange ! I suppose you 're very drunk . " " No . " " What is it then ? What are you doing out here in the middle of the night ? Why did you break into our room ? " " To say good-bye . " " But we have n't even said hello yet ! " " Let 's say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's smiling ! She said , " Your name is Lewis Moon . " " Yes . Your name is Andy . What were you christened ? " " Agnes . Agnes Carr . " " That 's much better than Andy Huben . " " I tried for days to place your name ; then I remembered . " She had been running , and she paused for breath ; gazing at him , her eyes filled with tears . " Your people , and the mission  --  they were all so proud of you ! " " Yes , they were . " " Yet you disgraced them ! " " That 's what they said . " " May God forgive you ! " " Why should He , when I have n't forgiven Him ? " He laughed . She looked disgusted . " You 're not the least repentant , are you ? " " No . Suppose I told you that I did n't steal that money , that it was given to me. "  | " Why did n't you tell the truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was being said . A thief is one thing , but a betrayer  --  do you always talk like this ? " " Like what , Mr. Moon ? " " Like a missionary 's wife . " " I am a missionary 's wife ! " " Then why did you follow me out here , with your hair still wild ? Agnes Carr ! Maybe you were never meant to be a missionary 's wife . " " Mr. Moon , I came to beg you not to attack the Niaruna . " " All right . " " All right what ? " " All right , beg me . " " Oh please ! You must n't attack them ? " " I wo n't attack them ; I 'm just heading eastward .

As she spoke she gazed at him , and her face changed . This made him happy ; he awaited her , saying nothing . " I low strange you look  --  your eyes , I mean ! And your voice , when you talk about these things , it 's so quiet , so gentle . I do n't understand you ! Why do you do . . . And just now , coming here , I saw you crouched on all fours , like an animal ! You looked like a cat ! Really , you frightened me ! What were you doing ? " He felt removed again and did not answer her . She said , " You must listen to me . There 's nothing east of here but jungle . For two thousand miles ! You ca n't just go there ! " " That 's the only way to do it  --  go . When there 's a jungle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the far side . Because if you struggle to back out , you get all snarled , and afterwards the jungle is still there , still waiting .  | " I do n't understand you . " She looked annoyed ; he was trying to see her body through her bathrobe . " You promise then ? " " I 'll promise if you like . " She got down on her knees . " 0 Praise the Lord ! " she said , and began to pray . He too got down upon his knees , to see her face better . " What are you doing ? " he inquired . " Saying a prayer for you . " He took her hands and raised her to her feet . " Do n't , " he said . " Please do n't do that . I knew yesterday that I would not attack them . Listen  --  I know something , Andy . . . " But he had forgotten what he wanted to say . He reached out to her and touched her face ; her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took from his pocket the wild diamond , the clear drop of river fire and mountain rain , and squeezed it hard into her hand . She ran . " Good-bye , " he called . Good-bye , good-bye . It was still dark , dark and starless , when he turned the plane at the far end of the runway ; he could scarcely make out the wall of trees at the far end or where earth merged with sky . His hands on the controls moved swiftly and precisely but he was breathing urgently , and he did not wait for break of day as he had planned . He roared away into the darkness , veering wildly from side to side ; when he thought he was running out of ground he sighed , hauling back on the wheel , and the plane bounded aloft . The black wall was much too close , and jumped at him ; he rolled his wing to miss a treetop , hooting , and then he was high and clear . Already , off to the east , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling toward him across Amazonas . A lone black palm , bent sadly on the sky of dawn , sank away into the darkness as he rose . He flew boldly , straight into the sun . He was sailing eastward into all the mornings of the world , as the cloud forest and dark mountain range , the night and the dank river mists fell far behind . There had never been a day so brilliant . The dawn light caused the swamps to glitter , and pierced the muddy floods with life . It sparkled on the canopy , and illumined from within the  | wings of birds ; a flight of parakeets shimmered downriver like a windburst of bright petals , and an alabaster egret burned his eye . He laughed with joy and sang . The cabin of the plane confined him ; he would burst the plane apart . He was oriented to the sun , as if he had soared into its field of gravitation. lie was the sun in the sun-flecked wings of a golden insect , crawling across the dome of sky inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings below , the sun in the huge voice of the bird morning . All air and light and sound poured through him , swelling the universe . To meet the sun he had wandered from his course , and now he whirled off northward ; today , without effort , he could feel his bearings like a bird . Rcmate was in the distance ; he was headed straight for it , though he had not checked his compass . He knew . He could trust his eyes and hands to take him by dead reckoning . At Rcntate the inhabitants rushed like chickens to the center of the clearing ; he passed overhead , up the Espiritu . It was not until he crossed a " tiro village that he felt a first somber dread . Realizing where he was , not sure why he had come , his hands grew cold . He checked his gauges . His journey to the sun had consumed much too much fuel ; he must turn back now if he was to reach Madre de Dios . But Madre de Dios was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the next moment the dread left him and his mind soared once again . He switched on his radio set , wishing to sing something to the world ; he sang " Shenandoah " and " Columbus Stockade " and " All My Trials , " and the Portuguese words of " Jesus Wants Me For A Sunbeam " : " Brilban-do , brilban-do . . . " He flew onward . Because he did not know as yet how he would do what he must do , he swung wide of the Niaruna village , circling at a distance , and all the while he talked and sang . Another voice crackled thinly over the radio ; it had been crackling for some time . He put the earphones on and listened . " This is Les Huben at Madre de Dios . How do you read me ? Over . "  | Moon pressed the button on his transmitter . " This is Jesus , up in Heaven , " he said affably . " How do you read me ? Over . " But Huben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's safety were interspersed with flight talk : " By my estimate , " Huben 's voice said , " fuel-range ratio of your aircraft is very critical . Can I assist you ? Over . " " How about some last rites ? " Moon responded . " Over . " But he realized with annoyance that he had neglected to press his transmitter button . Huben came back again : " You are under the effects of a powerful drug ; repeat , you are under the effects of a powerful drug . You must try to concentrate , you are in emergency ; repeat , you are in emergency . May the Lord forgive you and keep you , Amen . Over . " " Thus spake the Lord to Leslie Hubens , His false witness : I call heaven and earth to record this day against you , that I have set before you life and death , blessing and cursing . " In the silence that followed he bellowed , " Deuteronomy , 30 : i6 . " Huben 's voice said , " 30 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in emergency ; repeat , you are in emergency . Where are you proceeding ; repeat , where are you proceeding ? Over . " Moon looked a last time at his gauges . " What is your exact location ; repeat , what is your exact location ? Over . " " I 'm at play in the fields of the Lord , " Moon said ; he removed his earphones . " Repeat , at play in the fields of the Lord . " According to his own estimate , he would run out of fuel in a few more minutes . The girl had said that to these Indians the white man was a creature from the west ; he circled wide and came in upon the Niaruna from the east , out of the sun . They spread like ants . A few stood still . They awaited him , just as they had awaited in his vision . But of course he could not land , not even a crash landing ; flyers who pancaked their small planes onto the canopy had starved to death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monstrous trees . As for the river , it was too narrow and overgrown for an approach , and there were no sand bars . In the vision he had leaped into the air , and he would do that  | here ; there was no wind , and if he timed it right and used his shrouds , he might drop into the clearing . He reached back across the crate of bombs and dragged the parachute up front , then began his climb in a widening circle , higher and higher , with the sun , until the canopy stretched away so far on every side that the whole jungle lay beneath him . The climb had burned up the last of his fuel . The gauge was lifeless , and he knew that he might stall at any time . His breath was short ; the altimeter read 9600 . He leveled off for his approach , so intent on his work that only when he braced the door open and the cold air scared his hand did his fear verge upon panic . But his breath came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a morning , all light and purity and color , even death must be magnificent . He tried to work himself into his parachute . But his vast solar energy was instantly exhausted ; he sat there gasping . " Hoo , boy , " he said , trying in vain to cheer himself . He bound his arm in the straps of the chute , and grasping the strut , inched out onto the wing ; how cold it was , in this cold light of heaven ! He was afraid again . Ile clutched the parachute to his chest , and with his other arm  --  the one run through the strap  --  he hugged the strut . Now he pulled the cord and the silk bulged at the crack . Now you 've done it . This time you 've really done it . The wind tore at his face , and his arms ached . Short of the clearing , a mile and a half above the trees , he kicked himself backward and away . Shoving his free arm among the straps , then clasping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes against the gut-sucking suspense , and the blow of the silk snapped open ; he fell the length of a long howl before the impact all but wrenched his arms out of their sockets . He blinked , in tears ; he was alive again , laughing idiotically in the clean sunlight of the upper air , legs dangling and swaying like the legs of a rag doll , drifting , drifting down through the great morning , in a wild silence like the wake of bells .  | THE MOON HAD TURNED , AND A WEAK SUN FILTERED THROUGH THE heat from the sky somewhere above . The supplies had come on the DC-3 two days before , and now the Quarriers waited on the river bank for the mission seaplane that would fly them to Remate . Even Hazel , in her conviction that no other place on earth could be so awful , was glad to leave Madre de Dios , although she remained angry with her husband , refusing to understand why Padre Xantes and Wolfie should come down to see him off . Martin reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a constant threat , the most insignificant arrivals and departures were events that all attended , but she did not relent . In recent days Wolfie had sought Quarrier 's company , but he merely came and sat and fumed , and scarcely spoke . His beard had grown ragged , and there were small bits of tobacco in it . " You run inta Moon out there , " he muttered now , averting his eyes , " you tell 'm if he thinks Wolf 's gon na hang around here forever he 's off his nut , because I ai n't . " Quarrier advised him to  | give it up and go back home . " The Old Wolf can take care of himself , do n't worry , " Wolfie said . Then Yoyo came , accompanied by the mother-and-daughter team which he had acquired from Huben 's band of tame Niaruna , the same band that had given up two women to ransom the captive nuns . Leslie had seen to it that the union of Yoyo with the daughter was sanctified in the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at being excluded from the marriage , since in the eyes of the band she was Yoyo 's first wife and her daughter little more than a courtesy to the new husband . But Leslie had placated her with beads and had thought of her subsequently , for religious purposes , as the mother-in-law . Yoyo pretended not to hear Quarrier 's greeting and peered about as if the missionary had addressed someone else . Finally Quarrier turned away and stared out at the jungle on the farther bank . Remembering the fate of Padre Fuentes , he was overcome by sudden di  --  i/iness ; how had Leslie found the courage to establish a mission at the same location on the Rio Espiritu ? Or was it faith ? It seemed to him that Huben 's faith , to judge from the support it had had from the Almighty , must be far greater than his own . Behind him , in elaborate insolence , Yoyo cleared his throat and spat . Quarricr glanced at Xantes , who raised his eyebrows and drew his cassock closer in a gesture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the priest 's expression seemed to say , and both men smiled . Quarrier disliked the idea that the Niaruna mission had been set up through Yoyo , who with his wives , dog , shotgun , and trading goods went off every few weeks in Guzman 's canoe on a slaving journey up the inner rivers . In his red shirt with rockets on it , Yoyo crossed frontiers at will . He sat in councils , attended feasts , and everywhere was treated as a man of consequence . At the same time he was recognized by brown and white alike as a spy and a liar , an agent of Guzman who was not trusted even by Guzman himself . Yet many of El Comandante 's operations , balanced intricately between the law , the practical realities of the jungle , and a nostalgia for the grand old days of the rubber  | boom when wild Indians were shot on sight , were based on the tribal information he obtained from Yoyo . Sooner or later the latter would reappear in Madre de Dios , his canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caiman and boa . More often than not , he brought along one or more Indian children , purchased ordinarily from their parents , whom he sold to the plantation owners along the banks of the main rivers . For reporting this situation Quarrier had got himself disliked by everyone in Madre de Dios  --  including , he suspected , Leslie Huben . Yoyo treated Quarrier with servile rudeness ; like Guzman , he had not forgiven the missionary for noticing the trade in slaves , and the hate in his moist yellow eyes was plain . Unlike Wolfie and Xantes , he did not wave good-bye to the Quarriers  --  the first time , Martin reflected , that Yoyo had ever declined an opportunity to imitate the white man . In the shadow of the warehouse , pistol on hip , the Comandante stood , thick and still in his white shirt and pants ; he did not wave either . ON the bank at Remate that same afternoon , Huben stood , feet spread apart and fists on hips , considering the Lord 's unconquered fields . Standing beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the long wait in Madre de Dios , were frayed by doubt and fear , and he grappled constantly with an impulse to outrage Huben . Still , he had to admit that the man 's confidence cheered them all , and he wondered if Leslie 's true crime in his eyes was not simply the possession of Andy . From where they stood , all of Remate could be seen ; how dared they put it on the maps at all ! Its dispirited clearing was surrounded on three sides by low thatched huts , like a debased caricature of a colonial plaza ; the fourth side faced the Rio Espiritu . In the mud of the clearing , thin dirty chickens picked and small hogs sighed . To Quarrier , as to everyone who came there , the name " Culmination of Evils " caught the spirit of the place exactly . The clearing scarred a wall of jungle which could not be held in check ; the green absorbed both fire and machete , flowing back  | across the tangle of ugly blackened stumps to close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick lianas which crept up from behind , and the interiors were infiltrated by pale tentacles , squalid liverwort and creeping fungi . The plaza itself , worn bare by feet and pigs , and beaten flat by heavy rains , had been a quagmire for half a century ; its soil was a sterile orange-red , as slick as grease . Through the prism of the mist , the heat of the low jungle sky seemed to focus on this wretched spot , where tarantulas and scorpions and stinging ants accompanied the mosquito and the biting fly into the huts , where the vampire bats , defecating even as they fed , would fasten on exposed toes at night , where one could never be certain that a bushmaster or fer-de-lance had not formed its cold coil in a dark corner . In the river , piranhas swam among the stingrays and candirus and the large crocodilians called lagartos ; in adjacent swamps and forests lived the anaconda and the jaguar . But at Remate de Males such creatures were but irritants ; the true enemies were the heat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more like an ague , of the silent hostile people of the rain forest . The inhabitants of Remate  --  ragged woodcutters for the most part , more Indian than not ; a small detachment of Quechua soldiers on punishment duty ; and the inevitable Syrian or Lebanese trader of the inner rivers who tended to these people 's needs in the only shack in good enough repair to close and lock ? all vied with one another to tell the Quarriers the latest news of the Niaruna . A party of warriors had appeared only the day before , in a large canoe . They had raised empty hands in sign of peace , then held up otter skins . The storekeeper had ordered the eight Quechuas to hold their fire , and the soldiers were still sullen about this . " Why would you fire ? " Huben said . " You 've seen Niarunas here before . " He was annoyed that he and Andy had been off downriver , testing the new outboard motor . The storekeeper shook his head . Not those tame Niaruna of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small knot of  | half-clothed Indians at the clearing edge . These had been bravos from the inner river . Huben said , " We are not padres . We are not catdlicos . " The storekeeper , a fat man of cold resilience , smiled briefly and shrugged his shoulders as if to say , It is all the same to us . He continued his account . The Indians had been told to come to the bank and to keep their hands on their paddles ; the Syrian had no confidence in the soldiers ' aim , even on those rare occasions when they were sober . But the Indians would not come in until the soldiers had drawn back ; the latter did so after shouting a little and shooting off their rifles into the air . For each otter skin , worth thirty pesos , the Syrian had given a machete worth four and a half ; then the Indians withdrew . Out on the river they took up their bows and loosed arrows at the settlement , then slipped quickly to the far bank , paddling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came running , firing as they ran , and in the battle a small child suffered a bullet wound in the leg . The Syrian reported to Madre de Dios a new attack by savages on the settlement of Remate de Males , and ordered large quantities of cane alcohol in anticipation of extra soldiers . Seeing Billy 's open-mouthed delight , Hazel shook her untidy head ; she then looked bleakly at her husband . He suggested that she and Billy walk around while he and the Hubens saw to their lodgings . " Did n't I tell you ? " Huben crowed . " Madre de Dios is like Omaha compared to this ! " Hazel and Billy had not been gone ten minutes when he heard her scream ; she came rushing back to the Syrian 's store , Billy in tow , her rough hair so disheveled that she looked mad . " This is no place for a child ! " she gasped at him , as an admiring audience of halfbreeds fell into place behind her . " These people ? why , they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cuffs of their pants slack in the mud . One man had a small marmoset on his shoulder ; its black head was pressed close to his own , like a demon whispering in his ear . A drunken man in a canoe along the bank had called out to  | Billy , laughing evilly and pointing at the water ; evidently he was suggesting that Billy would make a tasty meal for the piranhas . When she told the child to pay no attention to him , the man felt insulted . He shouted after them , and when they turned , seized a live chicken from the bottom of the canoe and tossed it into the water , causing his own wife to scream at him . Billy stared in fascination as the chicken , fluttering futilely , became soaked and began to drown . The piranhas did not appear , and the people on the bank laughed at the drunken man . Enraged , he jumped out of the canoe and grabbed a tame trumpeter bird which was picking along the water . Taking its legs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost in half , then tossed it out after the chicken . " Oh boy , Pa , you should 've seen it ! " Billy cried , unable to contain himself any longer . " Wow ! The whole water kind of got all wrinkled and then there was this kind of little noise , you know , like chopping , and it got all red in the water and everything , and that old bird was gone and the chicken too  --  they went after the chicken too . And then ? " But here he stopped , for Hazel slapped him . " You see ! " she cried . " You sec what 's happening to him ! And now you want to take him even further into this awful jungle , to see still more dreadful things , more cruelty and filth ! And you 're risking his life  --  our lives ! " The Syrian , Senor I laddad , belched . Quarrier took her by the shoulders . He had seen relish in Billy 's face but he had also seen a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the avenging angel . " You are free to go home , " he said . " I wo n't hold it against you . " " Yes , that 's it ! " Hazel cried . " You want me to take the responsibility ! Well , I wo n't do it ! " She glanced at Andy Huben , who had come running at her scream and was now trying to slip away . " We are your family ! We 'll go where you lead us , Mister Quarrier ! " She folded her big arms upon her chest , with an air that said that on the moral battlefield she was ready to take on all corners . " I never doubted it , " Quarrier said . When Andy had led Billy off to show him the tame Niaruna , he said to Hazel , " From  | now on , I 'll also take the responsibility for disciplining Billy ; I never did like to see a child slapped in the face . " Hazel startled him by cringing ; she drew her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen this gesture in all the ten years of their marriage ; unable to look at it , he turned away . His eyes met the flat gaze of the merchant . Though the Syrian did not speak English , he had been interested in the exchange and had felt no inclination to avert his eye . Now he opened his bad mouth to smile , and shrugged his shoulders . Once this man had exclaimed to Huben that if the Niaruna could be given a taste for beads and liquor , their conversion would become a simple matter ? why , look at the Tiro , he had said . But he had since become more philosophical about the stupidity of missionaries , and went on about his business without complaint . He had already amassed a considerable amount of money , in part through enterprise  --  his Tiro had shown him that the green pinfeathers of the common parrot would emerge yellow if dyed with toad-skin fluid , and he now sent quantities of rare yellow-headed parrots across the mountains  --  and in part because he preferred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Syrian had no hope , no heirs , no joy , and yet he was content . Senor Haddad , that same evening , sat with the missionaries around the crude table on the earthen floor of his store , gazing unhappily at his hissing lantern , which was consuming fuel . Because the community was lightless , its hours were the hours of day , but since he had sold them supplies and rented a shed to them which otherwise would have gone empty , he did not feel he could turn the lantern off under their noses . Quarrier was watching the avid face , flat and hollow like a soft balloon , when Huben pointed at the corner . The tarantula did not make Hazel scream ; she closed her eyes and shuddered , and Andy said , " Oh , goodness . " Haddad picked up a flask of kerosene used for the lamp . Without leaving his seat , he jerked some liquid out toward the spider . When it was drenched , he flicked a match toward the spot where it backed around in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spatter of kerosene with its bent legs . Hazel cried out at the same instant  | that the Syrian laughed , for the spider had ignited ; the small flame ran a yard or more before exploding quietly , in a soft puff . Quarrier did not know whether Hazel 's cry was a delayed reaction to the spider or a reaction to the Syrian , or to the fact , suggested by the man 's strange skill , that tarantulas were commonplace and that dealing with them in this manner was less hardihood than sport . It ( lid not matter . Remate de Males might break her nerve entirely , and he dreaded the night , the hammock slung in the open shed , the night cries of unknown creatures , the brown water and the vile open latrine . The four adults lay side by side , guts rumbling with fried manioc and beans , and listened to the drunken singing of sad mountain /maims by the soldiers across the clearing . The unseemliness of the sleeping arrangement had been outweighed , even for I lazel , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child , in all his innocence , was there to serve as a rein on lustful thoughts . They had searched the shed with a flashlight for night beasts and had fallen back , disheartened , before the swarms of giant roaches . I lazel had lain down to her rest without a murmur , but even in this blackest darkness Quarrier knew that she was rigid as a corpse , that one more provocation from the jungle would make her scream again and that one day she might not stop . Yet he could scarcely keep his mind on her ; it turned insatiably to Andy I Iuben , who actually lay there in the same room with him , only a few feet away . He ached with a longing that was not lust and he ached with guilt ; he could not sleep . Then he thought about what awaited them , and the fear grabbed his stomach and would not let go . He peered at his watch again : it was past midnight . Tomorrow had come , when they would go up the Espiritu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people related to Yoyo by marriage  --  would follow them upriver to the mission , and they would also take from the Remate garrison four Quechuas , known to the jungle tribes because of their uniforms as the " Green Indians . " Haddad 's mosquito netting had a strange and acrid smell ; just outside its close thick heat , the night insects whined . Quarrier  | slept fitfully . When daylight came , they rose exhausted in the cold jungle dawn , to a breakfast of watery lima fruit and a little farina meal mixed with hot water . Four soldiers were hunted out and separated from their companions ; if the four who were finally delivered in a mute and pitiable condition to the boats were not the same men assigned to the trip the day before , they were at least indistinguishable . They were Quechuas of the sierra , slack in the jaw and purple-skinned , with yellow eyes and stumpy mountain legs . The bleak gloom absorbed from their native tundra had been deepened by exposure to the jungle . All of them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear more brutish and unhappy . Quarrier nodded at them and smiled , and they retreated , bumping into one another like cattle ; one of them crossed himself . " They must think we 're demons , " Quarrier said sadly . " I wonder how the padre persuaded them to go . " He thought with sympathy of Padre Xantes , who had had to countersign Guzman 's signature on the note to the corporal at Remate . " They have no choice , " Huben said . " The Quechuas have never had a choice about anything . The Opposition has only used them , just as the Incas used them  --  they are a meek and stupid people . " " And shall they inherit the earth ? " His own remark made Quarrier uncomfortable . Quickly he said , " Are they really stupid , do you think , or just resigned ? " " What 's the difference ? " Huben 's ironic smile made Quarrier still more uncomfortable , and he turned away . He thought about his reservation Sioux , the terrible apathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stupidity . Billy was already in the bow of the canoe when Hazel came from the latrine ; she was ashen . She would not tell Quarrier what the matter was ; it was just too awful , too disgusting . But later she said that she had seen two giant frogs or toads squatting half buried in the fecal muck . Trapped in the water of the pit , they had grown fat on the swarming flies and were living out their lives buried in excrement . " They live in it , " Hazel choked . " They live in it . Why , no  | North Dakota frog could possibly  --  oh , this vile place ! " He tried to laugh , to tease her about clean-living North Dakota frogs , but she would not be comforted . She sat trembling in the morning chill , teeth chattering , all hunched in upon herself . He wondered if Andy Huben had seen the frogs . In the early mist the people stood in deferential rows , wideeyed like children ; their murmurings were as gentle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taught them that the evangelicos were evil ; still , the people did not expect to see these evangclicos alive again , and one or two were moved to call Siierte ! " " What are they saying ? " Hazel demanded , glaring at them until they backed away . " They are wishing us good luck , " her husband said . He climbed clumsily into the second canoe , a long black craft hollowed our of a single trunk and powered by the ancient forerunner of I luhen 's new white outboard . The canoe already held Billy and I laze ! and supplies , in addition to two soldiers with their kits and carbines . Ruben had a similar load , but with its new outboard , his boat would he faster . This was the motor sent with the blessing of Leslie 's sponsors in Wisconsin ; before departing the United States , it had had its photograph in Mission Fields . Now that he had his outboard , Leslie prayed almost daily for barbed wire to fence the mission hut so that the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would give them a little privacy . Leslie wore black basketball sneakers , a red baseball cap on his taffy hair , and a T-shirt tucked into lastex bathing tights pulled up above his waist , so that , with his short torso and long legs , he looked like a high-hipped boy ; the golden hair and soft tan of those legs  --  Hazel said that they reminded her of a pullet ? caught the dull light reflected from the river . On the lap of his wife , seated facing him , was his new short-wave radio , which invoked for its proud owner friendly voices from all corners of the globe . This morning he had summoned up American music from Panama , popular tunes to which he crooned accompani- ment . The music wandered on the river in the thick cotton mists of dawn ; it rose , fragmented , through the roar as he cranked his motor . Now Leslie stood up in the stern , and spreading his arms far and wide , cried , " Praise the Lord ! " " Praise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She sat opposite her husband , facing the motor . Maneuvering his boat into Huben 's wake , Quarrier waved to the people on the bank ; they did not wave back . He was depressed by the settlement Indians , by the filthy pants , the rotting undershirts of their deliverance . The weakest and most opportunistic people in a wild tribe were those who prospered under the white man  --  a fact no less true because Lewis Moon , in their conversation that night in Madre de Dios , had made this point . He was glad to leave Remate , as he had been glad to leave Madre de Dios . There were chambers of cold air upon the river . He was tired and nervous and cold , and shook so violently that he could scarcely steer . When the canoes had rounded the first bend and Remate had disappeared from view , he nodded to Hazel and they prayed . One hand on the outboard tiller , the other to his forehead , he prayed that the Lord would bless them and keep them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayed dutifully for the health and safety of His servants , Leslie and Andy , that they too might work for the Glory of the Lord , Amen . He watched her as she prayed . How grotesque and right it was that at this moment , stubbornly erect , borne against her will into the hated jungle , she should be facing backward  --  this poor great mule of a woman , he thought , with the last grace kicked out of her . He said , " Almighty God , we pray for Lewis Moon ? " " No ! " " ? that he be still alive , and that he may walk safely from the wilderness , to seek his own salvation in Thine eyes , Amen . " She spoke in hate : " I 'd pray for Guzman first ! " From the river rose sad supplicating limbs of submerged trees , writhing and shivering in the current ; on a sand bar at the bend ahead a pale caiman five feet long lay with its jaws agape ,  | straining to swallow a sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach of Huben 's motor it rose on its short legs and ran , carrying its body clear of the ground , like two men borne forward by a heavy log which they are about to drop ; headlong and obscene , it plunged into the current . A thrash of its armored tail and it was gone , leaving a soft spreading welt on the slow water . At Billy 's shout she had turned her head in time to see the reptile , and was gagging . " They 're harmless , Hazel . They say only the black crocodiles are dangerous . " " The crocodiles , " she muttered . " The black ones . Where are they ? " She fixed her eyes on the big red hands folded tightly on her lap . I le did not want those hands to touch him , ever again . A scent of the jungle caught him unaware ; he stared at the engulfing trees . Perhaps the canoes were being watched , had been watched since they left Remate . But this was Tiro country , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ; like the Quechua , they had made their peace with exploitation . At the same time one never knew what impulse might seize this people , whose resilience must have its snapping point , and for whom , unlike the Niaruna , stealth and treachery ranked high among the virtues ; on this narrow river it would be the work of moments to fill the chests of the Lord 's ambassadors with arrows . Having hidden any food and valuables , the Tiro could then paddle downriver to Remate with the news of another Niaruna massacre . Quarrier stared at Billy 's small eager body pressed into the bow . Perhaps the only thing staying the Tiro hand was that the idea had not occurred to them . He shuddered violently with cold . A need for peace came over him ; he had an impulse to cut the motor of the boat and drift silently backward into green oblivion , letting his hand trail in the cool water . Along the river banks where sun had touched the earth , wild walls of flowering trees and shrubs sprang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stilt-root garcinias and spiny palms , myrtles , cecropias and acacias , pineapple , and plantains with their scarlet blossoms . Hazel pointed at the pea vines , wondering if the  | fruit in the pods tasted anything like the garden pea . She also recognized deer callaloo , with its edible greens , but when Quarrier angled over to the banks to let her pick some , she held them in her hands suspiciously , then dropped them into the water . " It 's some foreign kind of pokeberry , like we have home , but different , " she muttered . " I do n't trust it . " And she relapsed into her dejection , though Billy sought frantically to bring her back , pointing out bright barbets , jacamars and tanagers which crossed back and forth in front of them ; he shouted as a stream of parakeets spun around a treetop , and a small , somehow familiar emerald bird bounded from limb to limb ahead . " A kingfisher ! " Billy called . " Lookit that funny kingfisher ! " They saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hanging nests of the caciques and oropendolas : " Lookit the giant orioles ! " But Billy 's voice was deadened by the motors , and as the sun rose higher the birds and colors vanished , like the mist . Hazel had long since turned to stone , and the child stopped calling . They went on into the growing day , up the brown river , the green canyons . The dry season had already begun ; the river was shoal in places , with sand bars lengthening at the bends , and sunken trees emerging like great black feeding reptiles of another age . A spotted sandpiper bobbed and teetered ; when it flitted off  --  Peet-sweet  --  Hazel cried out in recognition of this gentle bird from home and burst into tears . The Quechuas swung slowly around to grunt and peer and gape . When Quarrier smiled at him , Billy glanced at his mother , shrugged in an effort to look unconcerned , and turned away again . The wan glaze of the strip of sky over their heads had clouded to vapor above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickened , closing off all sound ; the motor 's roar rebounded from the green , defeated by the weight of stillness . In this world gone dead Quarrier saw a sloth , pressed to a high trunk for camouflage . Eyes fixed on the tree , he reached out to touch his wife , then turned when he did not find her ; his hand was wavering near her breast and she watched it without expression . The boat jumped a sunken tree and yawed around , sluicing a spray of  | water across their legs ; it plowed into a canebrake at the bank , and the motor stalled . Over Hazel 's shoulder , in the sudden silence , he met the gaze of the Green Indians . He grinned . " Muy estupido , " he said . They did not smile back . Nor did Hazel ; her face was straining , but she could not help him . Billy 's careless whistling , well meant , was thin and airy , and pained Quarrier worst of all . " There was a sloth , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pointed . She nodded , brushing aimlessly at her wet skirt . " I wanted you and Billy to see it . " She nodded again , and he dropped his eyes in fear of the smile that she would force . Now the river silence he had longed for was unbearable ; he yanked violently at the cranking rope , twice , three times , four , rocking the boat with the misspent strength of his own clumsiness . They reached the abandoned settlement at Esperanza as the sun , shrouded by the pall , slid across the narrow avenue of sky between the treetops . In 1912 the Niaruna , enraged by the brutality of the white man , had put aside their inter-village quarrels and banded together to destroy this place ; there had been three survivors . The old rubber camp had lain at a confluence of streams , and the last trace of it was a banana grove gone wild ; after the massacre a metal cross had been erected on the bank . The memorial was ten feet high , on a concrete base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But now the vines were so thick upon it that only one arm protruded through the green ; it had lost its form and soon would be difficult to find . Quarrier yelled at Huben , " Shall we stop and clean that cross ? " but Huben said , " That papist cross ? " and shook his head . THE Niaruna station was a two-hour journey above the Esperanza ruin . Perched on a bank of rufous clay above a river bend , the mission shed was visible a quarter-mile downstream . Both Tiro and Niaruna recognized the place as a frontier , which the Niaruna , but not the Tiro , crossed at will .
