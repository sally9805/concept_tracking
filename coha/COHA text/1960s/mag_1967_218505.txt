The Middle East has undergone so many Arab-Israeli alarums since Israel became a state 19 years ago that even the antagonists often find it difficult to take one another seriously . They huff and they puff , they bluster and threaten , they move troops around like toy soldiers , but-with the single tragic exception of the war over Suez in 1956 - their bravado has rarely amounted to more than local skirmishes . Last week the area once more seemed on the brink of disaster-and this time the huffing and puffing was more serious . In the closest that Israel and the Arab countries have come to all-out war since Suez , armies everywhere were moving across the sere , seared sands of the Middle East . <P> Syria 's radical Baathist regime sent its tanks southward to back up troops already massed along the Israeli border , mobilized its untrained " People 's Army " to back up the tanks and ordered students to form 150-man " battalions " to back up the army . The armed forces of Iraq , Jordan , Saudi Arabia and tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its 100,000-man reserves , drafted half a million students into a civil defense corps and warned all doctors , hospitals and pharmacies to be ready for emergency duties . Israeli cities were strangely empty , just as they had been on the eve of the Suez campaign : most able-bodied men had been called to their reserve units and were manning guns and tanks on the country 's borders . <P> The most ominous move of all came along the 117-mile Sinai desert frontier between Israel and Egypt . Ever since Suez , the frontier has been guarded by a 3,400-man United Nations peace-keeping force whose only assignment has been to keep the two hostile nations from each other 's throats . Last week Gamal Abdel Nasser ordered the U.N . troops to withdraw- " for their own protection " - not only from the border but from Egyptian soil entirely . Into their positions moved an Egyptian force estimated at 60,000 men , including one armored and four infantry divisions . It was the first time in ten years that Egyptian and Israeli troops had been in each other 's gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab-Israeli conflict , charged on both sides with the emotions of a holy war , had reached the flash point of hysteria . To U.N . Secretary General U Thant , the situation was " more menacing than at any time since the fall of 1956 . " At week 's end he planned to fly to Cairo to try and ease the tensions . <P> Bad Pupils . Both sides are responsible for the present crisis . Israel has never seriously tried to make peace with the Arabs , from whose land it was carved . The Arabs have never admitted Israel 's right to exist . Instead , both sides have engaged in border terrorism that has only served to deepen the hatred between them . Last November , in reprisal for guerrilla raids , Israeli tanks whipped into Jordan-one of its least aggressive neighbors-and shot up a town . Only a month ago , the Israeli air force flew into Syria-which trains and finances most Arab " commando " units - and shot down six enemy MIG-21s.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
