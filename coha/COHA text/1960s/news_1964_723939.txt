Reinert , president of the university , add Morris B. Abram , newly elected president of the American Jewish Committee , at the committee 's annual meeting at the New York Hilton .

" The references to the Pharisees as the " temple gang " and as " racketeers selling sheep and doves in the building " were also criticized . Future textbook authors were urged to " explain the true significance of the Crucifixion . Jesus suffered and died for the sins of all and for the salve. - tion of all . The only disposition ' proper at the foot of the Cross is sorrow for one 's own sins ; there is then no need to accuse others , " Positive references to Jews , the report noted , abound in comments on the Old Testament as a heritage of the Roman ; Catholic Church .

The study was written by Sister Rose Albert Thering , who received the cooperation of the American Jewish Committee . The committee also cooperated in a seven-year self-study of Protestant textbooks completed at Yale University Divinity School last year . A Jewish self-study has been completed at Dropsie College for Hebrew and Cognate Learninv . Its findings will be made public soon . The St. Louis University study comes at a time when the Ecumenical Council , at its next session in September in Rome , is expected to act on a statement defining CatholicJewish relations and absolving the Jewish people from the guilt of the Crucifixion . Last Thursday , at the dinner session of the American Jewish Committee , Cardinal Spellman voiced his regard for the Jewish people , stressing that anti-Semitism " can never find a basis in the Catholic religion .
