Modern technology treats harshly those who do not anticipate its rapid progress , and this is nowhere truer than for the military . The U.S. is not only working on next year 's weapons , but also on those for many years and even decades ahead . This year the U.S. will raise its research budget to a record $6.3 billion out of a total defense budget of $60 billion . More than 2,000 new weapons are on drawing boards or taking shape both in the military 's 83 labs and arsenals and in the countless defense projects of private industry . Among the more interesting : <P> &gt;-A Buck Rogers-style Army " jet-flying belt " that is expected to transport a soldier over the treetops at 60 m.p.h. for as far as ten miles . Weighing a total of only some 150 Ibs. , propelled by a Lilliputian fanjet engine and fed by a back-riding fuel depot of seven to ten gallons of kerosene , the new jet is aimed at superseding a current experimental backpack that is operated by rocket thrust and has a range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the new system can be proved feasible , scientists at Bell Aerosystems Co. , which developed both the old and new jet belts , are optimistic . The Pentagon has invested $2,000,000 in the project , believes that it can drastically alter infantry warfare through such means as mass landings behind enemy lines . <P> &gt;Two new versatile tanks that take naturally to water , which are being assembled at General Motors ' Cleveland plant . The Sheridan , the most revolutionary tank since World War II , is the U.S. 's first with a cannon capable of firing both conventional shells and guided missiles . It can be air-dropped from C-130 or C-141 cargo planes ( by eight 100-ft. - wide parachutes ) without damage , swim like a turtle across water obstacles . After testing , it will go into operation within a year . An even more versatile vehicle , the MBT-70 ( for Main Battle Tank of the ' 70s ) , is being developed jointly by the U.S. and West Germany in history 's first two-nation collaboration on a major military weapon . It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to crawl under wa ter , like a crawdad , on river , lake or ocean beds , traverse steeply slanting terrain and raise its turret to peer over hills and walls . It is air-conditioned and insulated against atomic radiation . The first experimental model is scheduled for completion next summer . <P> &gt; A Navy " surface effect ship " that is actually a giant high-speed hydrofoil capable of a speed of 120 knots and able to cross the Atlantic from New York in 35 hours , reach Viet Nam from San Francisco in 72 hours . Powered by gas and turbine engines and traveling on cushions of air , the ship could quickly transport troops to trouble spots , be adapted as a high-speed aircraft carrier or as a moving platform for deploying anti-missile missiles and ICBM batteries at sea . Though the program is still in the model stage , the Navy believes that it can have a seagoing version within a decade , feels that the ship will completely change naval warfare .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
