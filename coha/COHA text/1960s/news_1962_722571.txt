txt Letters to The Times Letters to . The Times President Backed on Peru Postponement of Recognition of Junta Considered Necessary The writer of the following letter , long active in the Pan-American movement , is the author of books and articles on Latin America . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I usually enjoy the keen comments of your distinguished James Reston , but I feel that I must differ with his article on July 27 criticizing President Kennedy 's withholding of recognition of the new military government in Peru . In the first place , Mr. Reston sums up the whole question of recognition of governments in a few brief paragraphs when it is one of the most discussed problems for the past century in Latin-American affairs . He fails to mention the suggestion just made by Colombia , Venezuela , and several other southern republics that the subject should be clarified by an immediate meeting of the Organization of American States . The Franklin Roosevelt Administration suggested a cooperative arrangement among all of the American republics . The recognition of Bolivia was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A long discussion of the problem took place at the Bogota Conference in 1948 . During the days of . Dollar Diplomacy the United States adopted a rule of nonrecognition of Central American republics that were formed by revolution . Precedents Cited Washington , at various times , has withdrawn recognition from Mexico , Argentina and other countries , with much less reason than presents itself with the present situation in Peru . My own feeling is that the United States has continually overstepped its kindnesses to the dictators and military forces of Peru since the days of Augusto Leguia , who became President of Peru in 1919 by a coup d'etat . Dictator Leguia received many favors from Washington . He increased , thanks to the Government and the bankers of the United States , the indebtedness of Peru from $10 , - 000,000 to $111,000,000 . When the Peruvians criticized him he sent them to prison . As an American in- ; vestor put it : " It cost us $100,000 , - 000 to lose the friendship of Peru , when we could have lost it for nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the continual line of dictators , with President Eisenhower conferring a special " decoration " on Gen. Manuel Odria . General Odria was one of the three candidates in the recent Presidential election , but came out third . I first met Haya de la Torre in 1922 when I was beginning my annual visits to South America . Even at that time he showed his interest in social and political questions and led a group of students in the organization called Apra ( " Popular Alliance for American Revolution " ) . From that day this movement has struggled for the development of democracy and the defeat of communism . It was not long until Dictator Leguia expelled him from his native land . He spent a year in Mexico at the invitation of Jose Vasconcelos , Minister of Education . He then went with a group of United States labor unionists to Russia . After careful study of communism he gave his decision in the following words : " The Communist system might be good for Russia , but that does not mean that it is good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oxford University and fellowshipped with British labor unions , the Quakers , and distinguished intellectuals until he received a call from Apra in Lima to return as a candidate for the Presidency of the republic  --  the first of his three efforts , the last of which he has evidently won . These few high spots in the past forty years of Peruvian history leave no doubt in my mind that President Kennedy could do nothing more than postpone recognition of a group of army officers who had used the very military machines we had furnished them to seize the highly respected President of Peru and imprison him in the bowels of an ancient battleship , incommunicado . I am equally convinced of the necessity of saving the Alliance for Progress and other inter-American movements by cooperation between 3 , vigorous Organization of American States with the President of this powerful country . SAMUEL GUY IN MAN . Bronxville , N. Y. , July 30 , 1962 . Tax Reduction Wanted To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I am strongly against Senator Paul Douglas ' suggestion that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see " the whites of the eyes of the recession . " I believe that such thinking is highly dangerous . If our people receive a tax cut , business would be on the upswing and there would be greater spending , which in turn would increase the tax revenue . Furthermore , I think if the Senate waits too long in the treatment of an emergency it would leave no time for revival of confidence and stimulation of our business economy . Under the present decline in our national economy , a stimulant is necessary to improve business in this country . I feel that passage of an emergency tax-cut bill would initiate a healthy economic state of affairs . M. MARTYN KAFKA , M. D. Forest Hills , N. Y. , Aug. 1 , 1962 . Voting Rights in U. N. Charter Said to Cover Loss of Privilege for Those in Arrears The writer of the following letter was formerly acting chief of the Polish delegation to the United Nations . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In its advisory opinion of July 20 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United Nations are legally obliged to pay their assessments for the Middle East and Congo operations . The General Assembly is expected to act in September on the basis of this pronouncement . Two important powers and a number of lesser states refuse payment or simply fail to pay . Under Article 19 of the Charter a member of the U. N. which is in arrears for the preceding two full years " shall have no vote in the General Assembly . " The question is presently being discussed in U. N. circles whether a decision concerning loss of voting rights has to be taken by simple or two-thirds majority . I would like to suggest that no special decision of the General Assembly is needed under Article 19 . This provision uses mandatory and peremptory language . The loss of the right to vote in the General Assembly is an immediate result of the accumulation of two years ' arrears . The General Assembly may " permit " ( by special decision ) such a debtor state nevertheless to vote if it considers that the failure to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Procedure Followed Contrary to appearances , the above expressed view can be easily implemented . On the basis of a report of the Committee on Contributions stating the arrears and the debtor country , the President of the General Assembly and the chairmen of the main committees cease to count the vote cast by the debtor state when a show of hands takes place and cease to call the name of that country when a roll-call is taken . That was the procedure used in the League of Nations when under the Covenant the parties to a dispute were excluded from voting . It is worth stressing that the temporary forfeiture of the right to vote is very far removed from an exclusion from U. N. membership or even from a suspension of rights of membership . First of all , it does not affect voting rights of the debtor in the Security Council , ECOSOC and Trusteeship Council . In the General Assembly the debtor retains eligibility to these bodies , to commissions and committees , as well as an unimpaired right to take part in debates , to submit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly may for political reasons be reluctant to suspend the voting rights of a defiant big power such as the Soviet Union or France . It is , however , worth while considering that the mere fact that such a suggested procedure , strictly in conformity with the Charter , is available ( plus perhaps a precedent in relation to a less crucial member ) may provide a potent motivation to pay the arrears rather than risk such a limited but disagreeable sanction . The financial " veto , " threatening to bankrupt and paralyze the United Nations , could thus be broken . ALEXANDER WITOLD RUDZINSKI . New York , Aug. 1 , 1962 . An editorial on the subject discussed above appears elsewhere on this page . Lincoln Square Art Queried To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Timm I read with consternation that the Lincoln Square Committee has ordered one of Henry Moore 's monstrous creations to be placed in front of the new Philharmonic Hall . If their object is to get a mass of metal , would n't it be more appropriate in this space age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those at the Museum of Natural History ? THERESA WISE .
