Snare drums roll . Spotlights lattice the darkness and zero in on a trim brunette and a dangling hook . She thrusts the hook into a ring knotted in her hair , and while spectators watch in disbelief the rope tautens , and slowly she is lifted up and up through the elephant-scented air until she is dangling 73 ft. high . Then she calmly starts juggling three pastel Indian clubs , all the while hanging by her hair . <P> Ringling Bros. ' hairborne Rapunzel , Chrystine Holt , 21 , is the new sensation of the 1964 circus . She came by her talent somewhat naturally . Her father juggles while he hangs by his teeth . <P> Chrys was born in Germany and started show business at the age of five , helping her father in the family juggling act . When he fell and broke his back two years ago in Hamburg , the circus owner asked her to go on in her father 's place .

" Does she do anything special to lessen the strain ? " I eat vitamin pills-A and B-and I brush my hair a lot , " she says . " And I wash it once a week like everybody else . " What kind of shampoo ? " That 's another secret . " <P> Maybe LePage 's ?
