txt Washington , Oct. 4 ? The defense department today decided that service men in Hawaii are no longer qualified for extra foreign service pay , but the troops in Alaska are . A spokesman took pains to explain that the decision had nothing to do with the weather or special living hardships . Hawaii ; the 50th state to join the union , got lopped off the list because the enlisted men there catch tours of duty over 30 months . Skirt a Ticklish Problem The decision was made to keep Alaska in the old " foreign duty " pay scales not because it gets cold in the winter but because the tours there last leas than 30 months . By drawing the 30-month line , the defense department avoided the ticklish political problem perhaps of insulting either state as a foreign point . The decision to redefine the pay for overseas duty was forced by the new military pay raise approved by the President Wednesday . Prior to the raise , the Pentagon 's definition of foreign duty was that outside the contiguous limits of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extra pay rolls . Lops Off Western Europe This was a little embarrassing to both Hawaii and Alaska as states , but all right with the personnel living there because of the higher than usual costs of living . The new legislation ' gave authority to the Pentagon to recognize as factors " undesirable climate and lack of normal community facilities . " So the Pentagon redefined reign duty pay " to- read , " special duty pay , " and drew the 30-month line . In doing so , it lopped off most of western Europe , including France and Germany , except for isolated posts , as areas entitled to the extra pay . The pay is only for enlisted men and it ranges from $8 to $22.50 extra . a month . The average pay raise for all ranks was $30 a month . Most other foreign nations , including Russia and all of Canada except the metropolitan areas , remained on the foreign extra pay list . In Wet Nam , personnel will draw ' an additional $55 , a month for " hostile fire pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel drew the extra money under the old foreign ruling , but now only 225 , - 000 will be directly entitled . 18 Million Savings A spokesman said the savings in dollars will be 58 million . However , the savings will mainly be lost in a new family separation allowance which will cost 40 million annually . Under this plan , enlisted personnel with the grade of corporal re 41 or above with four years of service will be entitled to $30 a month in addition to other allowances when they are separated from their families . Also cost of living allowances in some cases will be raised 10 per cent in certain instances not defined , which will cost another extra 1.1 million dollars . The hazard pay in Viet Nam will take up most of the remaining savings . The net effect of t h e redistribution of funds seemed to be that it will at least nullify the raises given to bachelor service men stationed overseas .                    @
