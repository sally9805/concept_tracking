Along with its legislative record , each Congress writes its own short hand label : innovative or standpat , Micawberish or Scroogian , spineless or rebellious . The 90th 's first session fell somewhere in between on each count . It reflected rather too faithfully the national condition of confusion and contention over Viet Nam and the urban crisis . Unable to change the course of either , its mood was often one of angry frustration . The fight over the proposed tax increase and efforts to curb federal spending flavored the entire session , giving it a bitter taste-but no tax bill and only marginal savings . In the House , where dispute was hottest , the Republicans began by declaring that the old conservative coalition of the G.O.P. and Southern Democrats was dead , but the bloc won more crucial vote tests than in any of the past ten years . Nonetheless , the tradition-clogged congressional machinery managed to finance the war , keep the important domestic programs going , and pass some key legislation . The record on major issues : <P> <P> Approved <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program 's 32-year history was passed , raising monthly benefits at least 13% with proportionately larger increases at the bottom of the scale . But the bill included restrictions on state welfare programs subsidized by Washington . <P> &gt; Urban , educational and poverty programs were generally continued , with some additions . For the first time , the model-cities concept received operational funding , and a new federal rat-control program was approved . <P> &gt; Federal jurisdiction over air pollution control was expanded and research efforts increased . <P> &gt; The consular treaty with the Soviet Union , signed in 1964 , and this year 's multilateral pact regulating weaponry in space and national-sovereignty claims on celestial bodies , were both approved by the Senate . <P> &gt;Meat-inspection standards for processors and distributors covered only by state law became more stringent . The statute requires states to raise their standards to at least the federal levels already applied to meat sent across state lines . Other consumer-oriented legislation extended the Flammable Fabrics Act to include all fabrics used in clothing and household furnishings and established a National Commission on Product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given a boost with the establishment of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting , which will subsidize noncommercial broadcast operations . - Terms for settling the national railroad strike were dictated after repeated extensions of the strike deadline failed to avert a stoppage . <P> <P> Defeated or Deferred <P> &gt;The tax increase-10% surcharge on personal and corporate income sought by the Administration - never cleared the House Ways and <P> Means Committee . After much wrangling , the White House promised to trim $2.6 billion from what would have been spent in the current fiscal year , and Congress excised another $1.8 billion . It is possible that some tax increase will be voted next year . - Civil rights proposals ran aground for the second straight year . The Administration 's omnibus measure proposed open housing , a ban on jury discrimination and protection for civil rights workers .
