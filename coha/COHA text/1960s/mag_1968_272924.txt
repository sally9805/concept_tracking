Businessmen are always talking about ways to end that chronic corporate ailment , the time-wasting conference . Now Danish Engineer Soren T. Lyngso 46 , head of a Copenhagen-based industrial instrument firm , has come forward with a conference-room conversation stopper : a sort of electronic tote board that reminds company staffers that talk is far from cheap . <P> Based on Lyngso 's conviction that at least " half the time spent in executive conferences is unproductive , " his $650 " Econometer " continually informs conferees of the rising amount of company treasure , in terms of salaries , expended as meetings go on and on . Programmed with the salaries of the participants , the device starts with the push of a button and , on a wall-mounted Scoreboard , flashes a minute-by-minute reckoning of the conference cost . The more and the mightier the brass , Lyngso explains , " the more power is used , the faster the wheels run and the larger the bill becomes . " <P> A tinkerer who started out in a small basement shop 16 years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings that have come with the growth of his own firm , Soren T. Lyngso , Dansk Servo Teknik , to two plants and 160 employees . He finds that the machine starts saving money even before conferences start : nowadays his managers whenever possible skip calling meetings rather than watch the machine add up the cost .
