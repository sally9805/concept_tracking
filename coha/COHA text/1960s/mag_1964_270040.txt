What wears purple Bermuda shorts , walks like a man , hits like a man , and occasionally loses its temper like a man ? A lady golf pro . <P> In golf , the big difference between boys and girls is money . Last year Arnold Palmer won seven tournaments and took home $128,230 . Mickey Wright , the ladies ' champion who hammers her drives 250 yds. and more , won about twice as many tournaments ( 13 ) , but her take-home pay was only $31,269 . Not bad , of course , but hardly fair . <P> Last week in Augusta , Ga. , Mickey and the rest of the girls got together for the 25th Titleholders championship , the ladies ' equivalent of the Masters-except in cash . When Palmer won the Masters last month , he collected $20,000 , and the rest of the field divvied up another $110,000 . Total prize money at the Titleholders : $7,500 . <P> It might have been a million as far as the girls were concerned . In the second round , Kansas ' Marilynn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tees , that 's a score any man would be proud of . But then she shot a third-round 77 , and had to score a one-under-par 35 for the final nine holes to beat fast-closing Mickey Wright by one stroke . <P> She also had to duck , just to stay alive . Midway in the last round , Mari-lynn 's playing partner , Judy Kimball , missed a 3-ft. putt . Swinging her putter in teeth-grinding disgust , Judy sent it zinging right past Marilynn 's ear ( see cut ) . At least she had the sense to hold onto the handle . The penalty for throwing a club is $50 , and at ladies ' prices , that 's no bargain . For winning the Titleholders for the second year in a row , Marilynn Smith collected $ 1,300 . Mickey got $1,000 , and Judy , who finished fourth , got only $625.
