Scene : The living-room of Flora MacDonald 's home in eastern North Carolina , a late July afternoon in 1776 . The place is a rather striking one in a pioneer or backwoods manner . At the Center is a large bay window , giving a view of cleared fields in the distance and a dark stretch of virgin pine forest beyond . The window is framed with heavy hanging curtains of the MacDonald clan tartan . Fastened spread up on the wall to the Right of the window is the British flag . And on the wall to the Left of the window is a large portrait likeness of King George the Third of England . A solid hand-hewn table is set in front of the window . At the Right Rear a stout door leads to the outside , with a clothes chest beside it . A similar door at the Left Front opens to the inner chambers of the house . Over at the Right Front is a wide stone fireplace with cooking crane , kettles and three or four pots and pans hanging along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are placed about , and a timbered bench is set in front of the fireplace . The feeling of the room is one of permanence and great strength as if it had been built against the wash and wear of time . At Rise : Sandy Ochiltree , a dried-up button-eyed tough-fibred old Scotsman of sixty-five or seventy , is dawdling back and forth in the room with a fearsome , long-barreled musket , giving himself commands and awkwardly trying to execute them . He is dressed in an ancient coat and kilt of the MacDonald cloth with ragged hose and shoes . His grizzled weather-bitten head is set with a tamo-shanter in which two crow 's feathers are stuck . Seated on the chest at the Right Rear is his twin deaf mute brother , SIMEY , likewise grizzled and weather-worn . He is dressed in a homemade Indian garb and is wearing a tattered blanket and carries a pack on his back . His haggard scrawny face is doubed with a few splotches of war paint and his scraggly gray hair , tied in a topknot by a string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat imitative of the crow 's feathers in Sandy 's tam . A bow is slung over his shoulder , and a rough ill-made tomahawk and a few arrows are hung in his belt . SANDY ( Working with his musket . ) Parade rest . ( He does so . ) Shoulder arms . Right about . Forward march . ( He marches a few steps . ) To the rear march . ( He ponders the execution of this maneuver a moment and then bangs the musket down on the floor and wipes his forehead with his sleeve . ) Dang my soul if I can learn this stuff , Simey . What 's the use of all these commands when a man 's got nothing to do but aim and load and shoot ? ( Commanding himself again . ) Ready , aim fire  --  and all by the book . ( He does so , stamping the floor with his shapeless shoe to give the shot . Then he consults a little book lying on the table . ) And that was the trouble in the battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enough execution . Now here are them rapscallion Whigs and young Dan Murchison lying in wait  --  ( Indicating a place behind a chair. )  --  and here are us Tories , brave and loyal souls all , Master Allan MacDonald 's men . We come a-marching up . " Lay down your arms ! " we say  --  " all ye who do battle against the lawful king this day ! " But what happens ' pon that , I ask you ? Nothing . They lie still , and not a bark or a growl out'n ' em . That 's the way of them varlet Whigs  --  deep and cunning . Then what do we do ? ( Consulting the book again . ) We hold a caucus . We will charge . " Form fours , " Master Allan says . ( Imitating and as if addressing a platoon of soldiers of his own in the room . ) Form fours , men . ( He lines himself up with the invisible platoon . ) Then with pipes a-blowing and the flags flying do we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down . ) And the red-hot bullets whinging ' mongst us . ( With his lips he makes the zip , zip , plop , plop of the bullets and simulates the men falling around him . ) Do we do that ? Nay , we do like the Whigs  --  every man jack for hisself and jook behind trees . ( He darts behind an invisible tree and peeps out . ) We stay there till black dark comes down . And then we creep across the creek . ( He begins creeping forward . ) And up the bank and tear in on ' em with a dreadful cutting and chopping of blades . ( He goes through some antics of stabbing the enemy . SIMEY stands up , growls and gestures with his tomahawk toward the outside . SANDY looks around . ) Whist , I tell ye . We stay right here with Mistress Flora MacDonald till the last trump . Take off that pack . You 've been wearing it for days . We ai n't gon na march away to the West , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ponders his military situation . Suddenly he throws up his hands , dropping his musket against the table and grabbing his throat with his own hands . He jerks his head backward and struggles desperately in the clutch of an adversary , himself . Gradually he begins to get the better of the opponent , choking him down and on down to the floor . A moment he holds his enemy so , then snatches his hands away , springs around , and grabbing his musket strikes the prostrate Whig a few hefty blows with the butt . He looks around at SIMEY and grins and mops his face again . SIMEY , who has reseated himself , stares stolidly out before him . SANDY glares down at the Whig . ) So ye 'd slip up and layway a poor harmless man from the rear , would ye , Dan Murchison ! ( He leans forward and peers at the body a moment , then turns and sits disgustedly down in his chair , fanning himself with his old tam . There is a KNOCK on the door at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls out . ) Who is it ? p. 3 VOICE ( Beyond the door . ) Open up ! SANDY ( Half-weeping . ) I knowed it  --  I knowed it . Soon as Mistress Flora and the family go off and leave me them Whigs would have to come again . ( The HAMMERING on the door continues . ) Go away ! Go away ! They ai n't nobody here but me and poor old Simey . Go away ! VOICE It 's me  --  MacAllister . Open up . I 'm not going to hurt you . ( Finally SANDY goes over , unbars the door and opens it slightly . ) SANDY Uck  --  ( MACALLISTER pushes his way in . He is a brawny , imposing Scotsman about sixty years old , dressed like the well-to-do planter he is  --  in a dark welltailored coat , wine-colored waistcoat , knee breeches and silver-buckled shoes . A touch of refinement shows in the rim of white linen at his wrists and throat . His gray hair is worn long about the temples and tied back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a narrow black ribbon . He carries a riding whip in his hand . SANDY stares at him sourly as well as apprehensively . ) You creep ' pon us all slew-footed and quiet-like , Mr. MacAllister . MACALLISTER Where 's your mistress ? SANDY ( His face caught in a sudden sweep of grief . ) Sorrow and woe is our lot ! Ochon-ochrie ! And only a handful of days is left to us . ( He creeps piteously over to a chair and sits down . ) Ruined and undone we be . Like the barefooted King of Norway  --  naked as a yard dog . p. 4 MACALLISTER The same old cussedness and complaining , I see . And you 're likely to be nakeder if you do n't mend your ways in this household . What are you doing with that musket ? SANDY Please sir , just playing with it . MACALLISTER Guarding the house , eh ? SANDY In a manner of speaking , sir  --  like a witch a-setting on a shank bone . But Lord pertect us , there ai n't much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place at Moore 's Creek and Master Allan MacDonald is made prisoner and bonnie Master Alexander too , and both sent to the far north to rot in a dungeon  --  they ai n't much left to gyard . MACALLISTER They 'll not rot in a dungeon , they 'll be exchanged when the time comes . SANDY ( Wagging his shoulders . ) And Master Donald Campbell that was to wed Miss Peggy  --  killed in cold blood . MACALLISTER I know . ( Glancing over at SIMEY . ) Greetings , Simey . ( SIMEY stares coldly at him . ) Still playing Indian , I see . SANDY Aye , poor daft fellow , one of the Lord 's afflicted ones ! MACALLISTER That 's a new item  --  that pack on his back . p. 5 SANDY Aye , him and me 's been thinking of leaving all these troubles and marching toward the Indian country in the west . SIMEY ( Grunting . ) Oohm  --  oohm  --  SANDY I tell ye we ca n't go yet , Simey . We got to stay here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Lifting his glance by MACALLISTER. ) quit bothering her . MACALLISTER Have the Whigs been here lately ? SANDY ( Throwing up his long-taloned hands . ) Aye , last week ' t was  --  them villains come marching through the yard and driv off our cattle  --  what was left of ' em  --  and me fighting valiant-like to the last breath . They taken all our corn and threatened to burn down the house and Mistress Flora begging ' em not to . Ill-sick she was but still a-begging ' em to spare her home . They go away and in two days another crowd comes . They taken our silverware and what little meat we had in the smokehouse . And now you come with your men . MACALLISTER I 've got no men  --  I 'm alone . I tied my horse down there in the woods . ( SIMEY starts creeping up behind MACALLISTER , his tomahawk raised . SANDY springs across the room and jerks him back. ) p. 6 SANDY Ow-ow ! He 'd hang us all . ( He pushes SIMEY down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at SIMEY . ) MACALLISTER Behave yourself , Simey , or I 'll teach you how it hurts . ( SIMEY shudders and sits now all drooped over . ) SANDY Oh , say you wo n't harm poor mistress . MACALLISTER Of course not . I ask you where is she ? SANDY They 're coming right back soon . They 're way down the hill by spring . They 've gone to put the baby away . MACALLISTER Uhm . Anne 's child ? SANDY Aye . The Whigs burnt down Major MacLeod 's house yanside the county and Mistress Anne had to move over here with her mother . ( Savagely . ) May the curse of the forty-eight kings including Fergus  --  MACALLISTER Never mind the curse .  --  And they 're burying the baby ? SANDY Putting its little body in the cold , cold earth to sleep until the judgment morning . And in that day , let me tell you , sir , a monstrous mass of hypocrites and murderers are going to be jerked from their tombs to be judged by the All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Better a millstone were hanged about the neck of that Dan Murchison , for I 'll be there in my snow-white robe a witness against him . p. 7 MACALLISTER Yes , if you can break out of hell to get there  --  you old liar ! SANDY Sorrow ! Sorrow ! And here knee-deep in the grave I 'm left to stand on gyard over the ruins of this house  --  doomed and desolate as it be . ( He pulls the old musket toward him . ) MACALLISTER ( Gazing a bit abstractedly about him . ) The house looks all right . SANDY But stripped , stripped worse'n the lady in the Bible . MACALLISTER Some things they have n't stripped  --  that picture there and that flag . SANDY ( Chuckling . ) We had ' em hid away , sir , when them Whigs was here . MACALLISTER Well , you 'd better burn ' em up . Have you any food left ? SANDY Hardly a grain , sir . I swept the floor of the barn this morning to get a little corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me ketches a rabbit in our rabbit gum . Mistress Peggy 's got a mush cooking there on the coals . Bless her soul to heaven . Night and day she works like any servant here , she that was set to be Master Donald Campbell 's wife and walk in silk and laces there in Cross Creek . Ah , that I should ever have lived to see her hands grow rough and red with labor in this howling wilderness  --  and she with kings and queens in her line that goes back to Adam 's day . Aye , sir . p. 8 MACALLISTER We 've all got to forget kings and queens now , Sandy Ochiltree . There 's going to be a new time in this land of ours . Everybody will work and be proud of working . ( SANDY grimaces . ) SANDY Plighted and twined they were , and a bullet took his life away there at Moore 's Creek . And every night now by her bedside she lifts her little hands all twisting in grief and sends her prayers out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done the mortal deed . MACALLISTER I wager she 's praying for the safety of Dan Murchison himself who 's off fighting for freedom . SANDY And why should a wonder and glory like her pray for that hellcat , I ask ye ? MACALLISTER Because he 's wonder of a lad and he loves her . And Donald Campbell with all his lace and foppery was a poor thing beside him , that 's why , Sandy . SIMEY Oohm  --  oohm ! SANDY ( Yelling . ) Whist , will ye ! We ai n't a-going from here , not now with all these enemies about . ( He glares at MACALLISTER . ) Aye , with whatever turmoiling and gouging of guts may be I 'll stay here by my folks . ( Pleadingly . ) You did n't bring us any food , did you , sir ? p. 9 MACALLISTER No . SANDY Cousin Jenny Ban MacNeill brung us some yistiddy  --  all the way from over the river , she did . Kinsfolks ort to hold together , she said , Whig or Tory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not here ? SANDY Yes sir , down there helping put the little baby away . Me and Simey dug its grave this morning and when they come back him and me 's got to go down there and cut logs and pile on it to keep the wolves from coming to dig it up  --  aye , Lord . ( He throws out his hand in a gesture of grief and the musket falls clattering to the floor . He whirls around in fright and stands trembling as if expecting it to go off . And then he timidly reaches down and picks it up . ) Some day that thing 's going to shoot and kill me sure as I 'm born . It jumps right out'n my hand . ( PEGGY MACNEILL comes quietly in at the Right Rear . She is an attractive young woman of some twenty or twenty-one , full-figured , of medium height and with dark gray eyes and auburn hair . She is poorly but neatly dressed in the broad skirt and tight bodice of the times , wearing a light blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is carrying a heavy bucket of water , and stops an instant in surprise when she sees MACALLISTER . ) MACALLISTER Greetings , Peggy . p. 10 MACLEAN Cousin Alec . ( She comes quickly on across the room and sets the bucket on the hearth . ) MACALLISTER And how are you , Peggy ? ( He takes her hand warmly in both of his . ) MACLEAN Well . And you and your family ? MACALLISTER Still struggling and working ahead in these stirring times . MACLEAN So are we all working  --  now , Cousin Alec  --  doing what has to be done . ( She turns and examines the gruel cooking on the coals . ) MACALLISTER I 've come to see your Aunt Flora . MACLEAN She and Cousin Jenny Ban are coming with Anne , there . ( She gestures . ) MACALLISTER I 'm sorry to hear about the baby , Peggy . ( PEGGY shakes her head and says nothing . MACALLISTER goes on . ) I 'm here on an urgent matter . ( He looks over at SANDY . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the goats . ( She takes a pail from behind the chimney and holds it out to him . ) SANDY Aye , ma'am . ( He comes over and gets the pail. ) p. 11 MACLEAN And take your musket . Maybe you 'll see a squirrel or a rabbit . No harm can come to the house now with Mr. MacAllister here . SANDY Hanh ! Simey , bring your bow and arrows . ( He gestures to his BROTHER . ) I could n't hit a barn door . ( He sets the gun in the corner . Suddenly he brays out a defiant stave of song at MACALLISTER. )  --  God save our Lord the King , Long live our noble King , &nbsp; &nbsp; God save the King . ( He glances piously up at the portrait on the wall , then he and SIMEY go out . ) MACALLISTER ( Staring after SANDY and then turning toward PEGGY . ) I 'm sorry to hear about Anne 's child , Peggy . MACLEAN It 's almost killed her and Aunt Flora too . MACALLISTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great hopes for it and for all her children here in this new world . MACLEAN Had ?  --  Yes , and still has  --  ( Softly. ) in this new world . MACALLISTER All of you should have moved over to my plantation weeks and months ago . I begged you to . I could at least have fed you , and had medical care for the baby , protected you . But no , she had to remain out here , carrying on her hopeless struggle for the Tory cause . p. 12 MACLEAN She does n't think it 's hopeless , Cousin Alec . MACALLISTER ( Shaking his head . ) Ah , but I warned her , pleaded with her , pleaded with them all , with Allan , but it did no good . MACLEAN Uncle Allan and Aunt Flora have seen their duty and they 've done it . And she will keep on doing it . MACALLISTER I hope not  --  now . MACLEAN ( Looking up at him . ) What 's happened ? MACALLISTER And I hope you 've finally come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cousin Alec ? MACALLISTER You know very well what . MACLEAN Like Aunt Flora I had a duty to do  --  and I would have done it  --  if Donald had not died . MACALLISTER Proud you are , a MacLean of Jura , but not too proud to find joy and happiness in a new life , Peggy . ( Smiling at her . ) And I know you will . MACLEAN ( Turning suddenly toward the fireplace and digging in the ashes with the toe of her shoe . ) I hope Cousin Jane keeps well . p. 13 MACALLISTER She does . ( Going on . ) Did n't I see how things were going for you when I was out here eight months ago ! All the splurge and preparation for your and Donald 's wedding brought no happiness to you . Your thoughts had begun to dwell on someone else  --  a strong marching lad , working in the fields out there . ( Watching her as he is silent . ) No doubt you 've heard of the great doings of Dan Murchison in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Have you ? MACLEAN Cousin Jennie Ban has mentioned him . MACALLISTER Already he 's one of our most trusted men , a sort of hero among us . He almost captured the Tory governor at Fort Johnson single-handed . And with the power of his own two arms he 'll build himself a place in this colony and he 'll build it for you too , Peggy . MACLEAN I  --  please , Cousin Alec . ( She bends quickly down and stirs the gruel , trying to hide the feeling in her voice . ) Dan  --  Dan  --  is he safe ! Nothing has happened to him ! MACALLISTER My prayers are about him , Peggy , about you and him . And when he gets here  --  MACLEAN ( Straightening suddenly up and gazing at him , her face tinged with color . ) Dan  --  is he coming here ? p. 14 MACALLISTER I 've sent a fast messenger for him to intercede for your Aunt Flora  --  with General Lillington  --  and then to ride here . God grant he arrive in time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater danger than ever before , Peggy . We 've got to save her . You must  --  ( The rear door opens and JENNIE BAN MACNEILL comes in with FLORA MACDONALD and ANNE MACLEOD , Flora 's daughter , and JAMES , Flora 's son . JENNIE BAN is in her late fifties , a rough , peppery little woman with square features and square brogan shoes . She is a sort of harridan in appearance but a person of great heart and ability . She is smoking a corncob pipe . FLORA MACDONALD is now in her fifties and though she shows the marks of suffering and sorrow in her face and figure , she still retains something of her former beauty and grace . She is below medium height , with slightly graying dark hair , wide dark eyes , in which is caught a constant and heavy brooding thoughtfulness , and clean-cut decisive yet delicately feminine features . ANNE MACLEOD , a slender and frail young woman and overcome with grief , is leaning for support on her MOTHER . JAMES MACDONALD is a quiet , bookish-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows in the threadbare clothes of all the family . As they enter the door JENNIE BAN sees MACALLISTER . She stops and throws up her hands in irritation. ) p. 15 MACNEILL Well , more trouble . MACALLISTER ( Quietly . ) Greetings , Flora  --  Anne  --  James  --  and you too , Cousin Jennie . ( They ALL return his greetings as they come across the room . PEGGY at the fireplace now lifts up the pot of gruel . ) MACLEAN Come to your room , Anne . This gruel will make you feel better . ( She leads ANNE out at the left . The rest of the family settle themselves about the room and JAMES stands beside his mother 's chair , his distrustful and questioning young eyes on MACALLISTER 'S face . ) MACNEILL What woeful tidings have brought you here , Alec MacAllister ? ( She pulls out her knitting needles and a ball of yarn . ) MACALLISTER I 'm on an errand  --  well , of mercy , same as you , Cousin Jennie . MACNEILL From the droop of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of your political speeches . Well , we wo n't listen to you . ( She leans down and gets a coal from the fire to light her pipe . ) None of your boys been killed yet ? MACALLISTER I hope not . And yours ? p. 16 MACNEILL Puff . Puff . Ai n't heard a word from ' em in this madness . Aye , the whole world 's gone crazy . ( Straightening up . ) And instead of you stomping around making speeches and always causing trouble , Alec MacAllister , you ought to be out among your neighbors preaching peace and trying to persuade them to lay down their arms and return to tending their cattle and going to church on Sunday to listen to Parson MacLeod with humble contrite hearts there in Barbecue church . That 's what you ought to do . Ah , but you wo n't . ( The coal burns her finger and she flings it down with an angry click of her lips . ) Dod drot that thing ! MACALLISTER No I wo n't . And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come when the blind and misguided must yield to our cause . ( He looks over at FLORA . ) MACNEILL ( As she knits . ) You and your cause ! There 's only one cause  --  and that 's being friends and living together in peace and not spilling your own kin 's blood on the battlefield . ( Puffing her pipe angrily . ) Aye , what good is any cause to me and me myself with six grown sons out somewhere tonight ready to kill each other or be killed ? I ask you what ? MACALLISTER No good to the three of them that 's on the Tory side , that 's sure . And instead of you sitting here spouting foolishness you yourself ought to be out trying to spank some reason into them that 's run mad following that king there . I reckon you knit one sock for a Whig and another for a Tory , do n't you , seeing as you 've got boys on both sides ? p. 17 MACNEILL Well , there 's some sense in that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I reckon folks 'll go on killing and shooting till there ai n't nobody left . And what for ? You and your liberty , and Flora here , poor thing , with her empire and one great English-speaking race united . JAMES I 'll get some wood to cook supper , Mother . ( He touches FLORA 'S shoulder , looks at her and goes out . ) MACNEILL ( Going on angrily . ) Oh yes , you can always get up some excuse to burn and pillage and murder if that 's the kind of heart you got . Back in the old country when the MacNeills were out cutting off MacGregor heads it was all for a cause and their sacred honor . And when the MacGregors would come home bearing a basketful of MacNeill heads and dump ' em on the floor it was still the same cause and honor on their side . I 've heard my grand-mammy tell about it . And the wailing and weeping of the wives and sweethearts and the little children were n't stopped by the sacred cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . ) Well , there 's no use my talking . It wo n't do any good with either of you  --  nor with my boys either . MACALLISTER No , it wo n't . Our men are fighting for a principle  --  a principle deeper than you and others like you will ever dream of . p. 18 MACNEILL Bah , principle . Call it what you will  --  it all comes to the same thing to a dead man . ( She shakes her head and makes her needles fly . ) Flory , you better go lie down now and rest yourself . We 'll fix up something to eat . We 'll even feed you , Alec MacAllister , such as it is . MACALLISTER This is no time to think of eating . I 've come over here to have a final talk with you , Flora . MACDONALD ( Lifting her heavy eyes . ) Final ? MACALLISTER You would n't listen to me in times past , but now you must . Your life is in danger . MACDONALD So has it been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimmers around her lips for an instant . ) MACNEILL Reckon if she were n't afraid to save Bonnie Prince Charlie in the days gone by and a price of thirty thousand pounds upon his innocent head  --  she 's not afraid now . Hanh , you need n't talk to her , Alec . I 've tried and it do n't do no good  --  no good to talk to anybody . MACALLISTER Will you quit unraveling your mouth , Jennie Ban MacNeill ! ( JENNIE BAN snorts and goes on knitting . ) I 'm trying to warn you before it 's too late , Flora . Colonel Philip Alston , the Whig leader , is marching down this way  --  burning and laying waste all Tory property . I got word of it and hurried here as fast as I could . And woe to you if you fall into his hands . ( FLORA is silent . ) I 've sent  --  sent a fast messenger to General Lillington begging for an order to protect you . It may not come in time . p. 19 MACNEILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You mean it 'll be Whig against Whig maybe fighting over her ? MACALLISTER I hope not . But fire and sword are loose , Flora , and this is no organized warfare in the Cape Fear Valley now but a bloody civil war . MACNEILL And you 've been a ringleader in bringing it about , Alec MacAllister . MACALLISTER ( Angrily . ) Will you be quiet , woman ! I 've come to ask you to be sensible , Flora . You are a person of note , a ward of the king himself . It is common knowledge that you have been rallying the Tories to the royal standard . I 've come to ask you to give up this blind cause you 're following and declare yourself  --  yes , just that  --  declare yourself for our side before it is too late . MACDONALD ( Sternly . ) And you are mad to think I 'd do it , Cousin Alec . MACALLISTER Mad ? I tell you America is going to separate itself from England as sure as there is a God in heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across an ice pond when the weight 's too heavy it has begun  --  and every day the crack is widening , widening . Every-where up and down the land the workers , the servants , the poor people like Dan Murchison have banded themselves together in a common ideal . Poles and banners are set up in the towns , in the hamlets and cross-roads , and the Sons and Daughters of Liberty have organized and armed themselves . They are marching toward one thing  --  victory . You 've got to listen to me , Flora . p. 20 MACDONALD And we are marching to prevent that victory  --  as we will . This war is not over yet . We have just begun to fight . MACALLISTER ( Staring at her . ) You believe that ? MACDONALD It 's true we lost the Battle of Moore 's Creek Bridge last winter . But our people have shown their worth . The Highlanders are still fighting , and they will continue to fight , even in small bands , until the king has sent enough troops to beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will never , never take oath against the cause I believe in , against another oath I took long ago . MACALLISTER ( Trying to control his temper . ) When I came to this country forty years ago I held the way you do , Flora . I was a loyalist then  --  believing as you do in the authority of the crown and the sanctity of the king . And then gradually something happened  --  I do n't know what it was  --  something in this wilderness and the struggle to tame it that gives men a new feeling about themselves , a feeling of self-reliance , of strength , of  --  MACNEILL Yes , liberty . We know the word , Cousin Alec . MACALLISTER Liberty . They get the urge to be their own master , to go and come as they please , to worship as they please , to be their own man , their own boss  --  yes , as becomes men full grown and free . They resent the meddling of parliament and the king . They want to have their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have created their homes , their families , the roads and cleared fields around them . ( PEGGY re-enters at the Left . She comes over and stops by FLORA 'S chair . FLORA smiles wearily up at her. ) p. 21 MACDONALD Cousin Alec is making us one of his speeches , again , Peggy . You argue well , Cousin Alec , but not truly . The people already have their own government , their assemblies , their houses of burgesses , guaranteed by the crown . MACALLISTER And all of them controlled by the royal governors under the king  --  to be dismissed , to be called , to be instructed as they see fit . Oh , I have seen it happening under my very eyes . My bond servants have caught this new spirit . I 've freed every one of them and helped ' em get a new start . And they 're standing with us to a man . MACDONALD ( With sudden hardness . ) It 's not liberty but license you 're talking about . And when the time comes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cry out this liberty and these rights , then you 've got no government , nothing but mutual bickerings , strife , even fights and killings  --  anarchy . What you have in North Carolina now . We learned that in the clan wars in Scotland and we learned it well . ( Her voice growing more firm . ) Cousin Alec , I know that only in union is there strength , a steadfast union of our peoples into one . I tell you so again . And as we grow strong here in America so shall the old world draw strength from us  --  like a great tree whose roots run deep and wide through the earth . It is our bounden duty forever to fight for that  --  to help build for that . p. 22 MACALLISTER Fine and glorious words , Flora . And they serve only to keep you lost in your blindness  --  a blindness that has already cost you your husband , a son , friends , and many an hour of wasted suffering . You 've got to open your eyes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) They are opened , Cousin Alec , and they see that such men as you with your wild rebellion have betrayed your trust , and you must be put down at all cost . My conviction , my belief has nothing to do with pride and pomp of nations , or wealth or power . It is a principle deeper than that , and it stands clear to me as a book to be read . Already our vast empire has begun to spread itself like a great sheltering plaid over the globe . Far ahead , generations ahead , I can see the age when peace and goodwill shall reign the world over because of its protection  --  because of its sheltering . And that ideal has given me courage , has given me and my husband and thousands of others like us courage to cross a treacherous ocean , to brave all the perils and obstacles of a wilderness in order that we might do our part as pioneers in the creation of that dream . For that I took the oath of loyalty after the Battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until I die . MACALLISTER You are a fool , Flora , and a rope almost around your neck . Once more I ask you  --  will you take the oath for the American cause and thereby save yourself and your family , or  --  not ? p. 23 MACDONALD ( Shaking her head . ) You have heard me . MACNEILL She 's a stubborn Scot like you , Alec . You might a-knowed it . ( MACALLISTER turns angrily about the room a few times , strikes himself with his whip and twists his leg a bit in pain . ) MACALLISTER ( Stopping . ) And what will you do now ? MACDONALD Continue to speak and work for the truth as I see it . You are wrong . Jefferson and Washington are wrong . Time will prove it . The people are not united against the king . The majority are for him . Your congress in Philadelphia is divided . And already reinforcements are being sent to General Clinton on the Cape Fear . MACALLISTER How do you know that ? MACDONALD Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MACNEILL She 's become a regular Paul Revere , riding out at night . MACALLISTER The British government has just recalled Clinton from the Cape Fear , Flora . MACDONALD No ! MACALLISTER He sailed to the north three days ago . ( FLORA sits suddenly silent in her chair , staring before her . ) The loyalist cause is broken in this colony and you might as well know it . And now I have to tell you that the North Carolina Assembly has passed a law ordering that all Tories take the oath of allegiance , or  --  suffer the consequences . p. 24 MACDONALD An assembly of traitors can make no legal law . MACALLISTER Sign this oath or Alston will hang you like a common thief and delight in doing it . I know him . I plead with you . MACDONALD Words are wasted on you , Cousin Alec . You can leave us alone now . ( MACALLISTER throws up his hands in futile anger . ) MACLEAN But , Cousin Alec , you are a member of the Committee of Safety . You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peggy , and it is beyond me . MACLEAN You have power . MACALLISTER But no military authority in the matter . My commission forbids it . MACDONALD And Clinton gone  --  ( Suddenly crying out . ) This is some mad dream ! The king 's men will come . Allan will be freed , my boy will be freed , and we 'll win this fight . MACALLISTER ( Somewhat more kindly . ) A mad dream , Flora ? Then you are the dreamer . I am dealing in facts , hard facts . Peggy knows it 's true . Look at her . She begs you , Flora . ( FLORA slowly lifts her face and looks at PEGGY , who gradually turns away to the window. ) p. 25 MACDONALD She does not beg me . MACLEAN ( In a low voice . ) Aunt Flora . MACDONALD She is brave and loyal . In my place she would do the same . MACALLISTER Then you would ruin her life too . You are heartless , blind and heartless . ( Pulling a document from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MACNEILL Now you listen to me , Flora MacDonald . You may be right about all this dream of peace and the empire and the world . I do n't know , and I do n't give a dang . But I 'm not going to sit here and let you drag the rest of your family down to death . Turn around here , Peggy MacLean , I want to talk to you . ( PEGGY still stands at the window , her head bowed . ) MACALLISTER It 's only Peggy 's great loyalty to Flora that keeps her mouth closed . MACNEILL Shut up ! Maybe there 's nothing to be done about Flora . But , Peggy , something can be done about you . You get on your duds this minute , lass . I 'm taking you out of this accursed house home with me . MACLEAN ( Turning back from the window , controlling her tears . ) Aunt Flora  --  I  --  I  --  ( Her lips tremble and then , coming forward , she puts her arms around FLORA . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MACNEILL Now we 've got two fools on our hands  --  ( Glancing at MACALLISTER . ) No , three . ( Suddenly there is the sound of SHOTS in the distance . PEGGY turns sharply back to the window at the rear . JENNIE BAN throws her knitting aside . ) Well , there it is , and every man 's got to fight whether it makes sense or not . ( She reaches over and grabs SANDY 'S musket . There is a scramble at the rear and SANDY comes flying in , carrying the pail in his hand . ) SANDY Them Whigs is coming down the road a-snapping and a-snarling . They seen me and let fly a monstrous great volley . And look , they put a hole plumb through the bucket and all the milk 's leaked out . MACNEILL I tell you this , Alec MacAllister , if you let them Whigs come in here and harm us  --  I 'll kill somebody if it 's the last thing I ever do . ( Looking at the gun and then handing it quickly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and defend us women-folks like a man . SANDY ( Moaning as he receives it limply . ) Oh , I would , but there ai n't no use . Them frenzy-minded cutthroats  --  Ooh , listen at ' em ! They 're coming on like savage dogs , a-yelling and a-barking . ( In the distance YELLS and HALLOOS can be heard . SIMEY backs in at the rear with his bow drawn . Now in the adjoining room at the Left the sound of a WOMAN 'S sobbing is heard. ) p. 27 MACNEILL And they 're scaring poor Anne to death . ( Calling . ) Hush , Anne , I 'm coming !  --  All right , you heard me , Alec MacAllister , you old Whig ! ( She goes out at the Left . SANDY runs over and stands close up in the crotch of the chimney and wall , the musket dragging in his hand . SIMEY stands close to him . PEGGY turns from the window to FLORA . ) MACLEAN Go upstairs and let me talk to them . Please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside , a THUNDERING on the door . No one moves . The HAMMERING on the door is repeated . SANDY cowers in the chimney crotch , and SIMEY now pats him on the shoulder consolingly . MACALLISTER looks at FLORA . ) MACALLISTER Well , Flora . ( He taps the document in his hand . The door is flung open and COLONEL PHILIP ALSTON , a rough-looking , heavy-set officer of some forty or more , comes in , accompained by a little young snaggle-toothed SERGEANT . They are both dressed in nondescript continental army uniforms , grimy and unkempt , and ALSTON carries a heavy sword in his hand . The voices of MEN talking outside are heard . ) ALSTON ( Peering about at the group . ) We are looking for one Flora MacDonald . p. 28 MACLEAN ( Glancing at MACALLISTER and then speaking . ) By whose orders do you act ? ALSTON ( Smiling grimly . ) You might say by our own , and we do carry a bit of paper with a list written on it . ( Bowing to PEGGY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be taken . Where is she ? MACDONALD I am Flora MacDonald . ALSTON Thankee . ( To the SERGEANT . ) Search the premises . A SERGEANT Yessir , Cap'n . ( He touches his cap with his forefinger and goes out . ) ALSTON And now , ma'am , by the authority vested in me I place you and your house under arrest . MACALLISTER ( Stepping forward . ) Colonel Alston , as a member of the Committee of Safety I am here on a prior duty . ALSTON Ah  --  Mr. MacAllister . ( Saluting . ) I did n't see you , sir . MACALLISTER ( Indicating the document in his hand . ) I have demanded that Flora MacDonald take this oath of allegiance in accordance with the new law . p. 29 ALSTON ( Ironically . ) And no doubt she has taken it . MACALLISTER I have every hope that she will , and confess the error of her ways . Then  --  ALSTON Your civil authority is great , Mr. MacAllister . I respect it . But this is a military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is for the American cause with her made prisoner . ( Deliberating . ) Yet if she will take the oath her sentence might be lessened . I say might be . ( To FLORA , after a pause . ) So you will not ?  --  We all know your fanatic loyalty . MACLEAN But a fair trail must be had  --  her defense given . Surely , Cousin Alec , you can demand that . ALSTON As she has made her decision , so has this court . ( He touches his own breast , then gazes at PEGGY . ) Your name , ma'am ? MACLEAN Peggy MacLean . ALSTON You 're a pretty thing . Whig or Troy ? MACLEAN Flora MacDonald is my aunt , sir . ALSTON Hah , then we may want you too . MACALLISTER She 's not loyalist , Colonel . Speak up , lass  --  declare yourself . p. 30 ALSTON Also to be taken  --  a son , a daughter , and a notorious old servant  --  I remember  --  by name one Sandy Ochiltree . SANDY ( With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boasting of his loyalty to the king at the crossways store . Is he present ? SANDY Lord have mercy ! ALSTON ( Looking over at him . ) I see . Standing armed and defiant too . I make a note of that . ( Loudly . ) Drop that gun ! ( SANDY drops the gun as if it had suddenly grown hot to his touch and puts his face farther up in the chimney corner . His tam-o ' - shanter falls off and SIMEY picks it up and begins to fan him with it . ALSTON steps over , takes the musket , looks at it and lays it on the table behind him . ) And now , ma'am , if you have any preparations to make , make ' em quick . And then everybody get out of the house , for it might prove a little warm in here . MACLEAN Would you burn the place down ? ALSTON That is our intention . ( He looks about him and sees the flag on the wall . Snatching it down , he flings it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a funeral shrouding . ( JAMES comes rushing in at the rear with an armful of wood . He stops , throws the wood toward the fireplace and then advances on ALSTON with a single stick in his hand. ) p. 31 JAMES What are you doing here ? ( FLORA lays her hand on JAMES ' arm . JENNIE BAN enters at the Left with ANNE . ) ALSTON Is he your son ? We want him , too . He 's named on the paper . ( JAMES springs across towards ALSTON , but MACALLISTER moves quickly in front of him . ) MACALLISTER Keep your head , boy . ( ANNE hurries over to her MOTHER and clings to her . ) MACLEOD Mother , Mother ! MACNEILL ( To ALSTON . ) If I was a man I 'd wring your neck . ALSTON ( Whirling around . ) Ah-hah , another Tory . MACNEILL I 'm not a Tory , but I 'd like to get my broadsword and cut your shirt off . Ai n't you got a bit of respect for people  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not a Tory what are you doing here ? MACNEILL Helping out with the sick folks and the suffering  --  and burying the dead . That 's bigger than Whig or Tory . Of course you do n't understand that . ALSTON ( Soberly . ) I reckon I do . Suffering  --  death  --  we all know what they are in this war . Our own houses burned , fields laid waste , loved ones murdered . ( Fiercely . ) And we know who to thank for a lot of it . But for this woman here the Tories from Wilmington to Guilford Courthouse would have laid down their arms long ago . Well , she will find that revenge is a two-edged sword that can cut both ways . I am waiting , Madam . p. 32 MACNEILL For mercy 's sake do something , Flory . Do n't sit there like seeing a ghost from yonder world . ( FLORA sits staring ahead of her saying nothing . ANNE turns brokenly away and sinks down into a chair , her head bowed over on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to move a muscle to save her ? MACALLISTER It 's in Colonel Alston 's charge , not mine . She could still swear for our side . SANDY ( Moaning and shaking . ) This is the end . The deadfall of the grave has fell upon us at the last . ALSTON I make no promises  --  but I still say if she will take the oath , she may receive a fair trial , her guilt to be proved upon her . MACDONALD ( Quietly . ) There is no guilt to be proved , Colonel Alston , and you know it . I have only done my duty in serving my king . And I have tried in every way I could to prevent all acts of lawless violence , the spilling of innocent blood . As a mother and a woman I share the horror of that . ALSTON Do n't think being a woman is going to change a hemp rope into a pretty ribbon for you . ( Sternly . ) Make your choice , Madam . There 's a mighty fitting limb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it already . p. 33 MACNEILL They 've got you , Flory . Now I 'd be sensible and swear  --  I would . MACLEOD ( Weeping . ) Please , Mother . Let us save ourselves . There is nothing we can do . JAMES Mother , do it  --  do it . MACDONALD ( Looking up at him , her face white and strained  --  whispering . ) Jamie  --  my son  --  your father is a prisoner  --  a prisoner with honor . JAMES I 'm afraid for you  --  afraid . ( His shoulders heave with sobs and he turns away toward the fireplace . PEGGY puts her arm around him . ) MACLEAN I beg you , Aunt Flora  --  for Uncle Allan 's sake , for your own sake , for  --  MACDONALD ( Huskily . ) You would all desert me , then . ( Lifting her chin and gazing at ALSTON . ) And I ask you to leave this house , Colonel Alston . ALSTON ( Incredulously . ) This is no time for joking , Flora MacDonald . MACDONALD ( Steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Leave my home ! p. 34 ALSTON I am , and with you as my prisoner . MACDONALD ( Rising . ) If you touch me you do so at your own peril . ALSTON I 'll chance that . MACDONALD ( Looking up at the portrait . ) Then I call upon my king to witness the deed you 'd do . As he has laid his hand upon my head and blessed me , made a father 's promise to me , sworn his loyalty to me as mine to him , so do I swear to you that if you harm me he will give you no rest day nor night . At your waking up , your lying down , the power of his mighty arm will reach for you . And his soldiers will never stop hunting , hunting until they find you and shoot you like the dog you are , whether sleeping or awake , rising up or sitting down . And through future days honorable men everywhere will spit your foul name from their lips with a curse . ( A hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave me in peace  --  yes , for your own sake and safety , leave me . ALSTON ( Shaking his head , his voice somewhat quieter . ) In the cause I am fighting for , neither kings nor lords nor ladies , threats nor abuses bother us overmuch . You continue to stand as an enemy to us . Then you must yield or we will hang you like any other traitor in spite of your king . And we will set his picture there to see it done . It 's for you to decide and decide not . p. 35 MACDONALD And I have decided . ( Her voice still level and resolute . ) As a girl I braved danger night after night in the hills of Scotland for the cause I served . So it has been my endeavor to do all these years  --  follow the truth as I saw the truth to be . Now I am old , my days are almost ended . Little enough of life is left to me . ( Strongly . ) Then shall I shame it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have given by begging for mercy from such as you , leave my name a disgrace to my children and my brave husband ? Never . Let me die then with honor and my name live as a cry on brave men 's lips . ( MACALLISTER , JENNIE BAN , PEGGY and the OTHERS now look on in moody apprehensive silence . ANNE continues to weep softly . FLORA sits down in her chair again . ) Go ahead and shame yourself forever if you will , Colonel Alston . My cause is just and I am not afraid . ALSTON I have listened to you , been patient with you , given you every chance to save yourself . You are determined . So be it . I command you and your household to assemble as prisoners outside . MACALLISTER But the family is innocent . ALSTON That will be decided . SANDY ( Blubbering . ) Merciful saints in Paradise ! Pity us . ( SIMEY mumbles comfort over him. ) p. 36 MACALLISTER Mistress MacLean here is not a Tory . ( He indicates PEGGY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both will , and the lad too . SANDY ( Turning to them and whimpering . ) And me  --  what about me , peoples ? Swear me safe , somebody , before he cuts my throat . MACNEILL And you too , drat ye ! SANDY ( To ALSTON . ) True , sir , your honor . I 'll take oath to anything , anything . Just name it , sir . And Simey , my brother here , is a sweet man of peace like me , both harmless as two doves , sir . ( SIMEY starts to pull his tomahawk and moves towards ALSTON . SANDY grabs it away . He stumbles over and falls on his knees before FLORA , twisting his gnarled hands up before her . ) Man and boy I have served you for fifty-odd year , Mistress Flora , and never axed you to go against your great and shining principles in all that enduring time . But now , it 's too late to hold out any longer . Have mercy on us and save us . MACDONALD ( Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm will come to you , Sandy , I promise . SANDY But , Mistress  --  you  --  it breaks my heart to see harm fall ' pon top your bonnie head . p. 37 ALSTON ( Reaching over and touching SANDY with the point of his sword . ) Out with you , old man . ( With a gurgle of terror SANDY flies over to the door at the Left and stands holding onto the door lintel , his face turned back in horror . SIMEY hurries to him . ) We are ready , Madam . MACDONALD Let it never be said that in one thing I obeyed a wretch like you . Do what you will with me , hang me , shoot me , but I will not help you . You will have to drag me from this room . ( She grips the rungs of her chair and stares malevolently at ALSTON . He moves angrily towards her . ) MACLEAN ( Crying out . ) Do n't touch her . ( She springs forward to protect FLORA , and then stops suddenly still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Darkly . ) Young woman , I have no great urge to hang you too , but if you interfere  --  ( Turning to FLORA . ) For the last time , Madam , will you come quietly ? ( FLORA continues to stare at ALSTON . He strides to the near door and calls out . ) Sergeant ! ( PEGGY , in whom a great struggle has been going on , jerks up the musket now and steps out into the room . Holding the butt in the crook of her arm she levels it at ALSTON as he turns from the door . He starts back in astonishment . ) Put down that gun , girl . ( A gasp of fear breaks from the OTHERS . SANDY moans and hides his face against the wall . SIMEY stands stolidly and still protectingly beside him. ) p. 38 MACLEAN ( Trying to control the trembling in her voice . ) Put your sword on the table , Colonel Alston . ALSTON ( Blinking uncomprehendingly at her . ) Peggy MacLean , you 're likely to get yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . MACALLISTER You are mad , Peggy . They 'll kill all of you . MACLEAN ( Her eyes bright and her face flushed with excitement and anger . ) Stand back , Cousin Alec . ( She waves him back . ) And you , sir , you 'd better obey me . MACNEILL ( Suddenly clapping her hands . ) Hooray , Peggy ! That 's a brave lass . ( Stepping over to ALSTON . ) Gim me that sword . ALSTON Get out of my way . ( He turns back again to the door . But JENNIE BAN jumps forward , slams it , bars it and stands with her back to it . ) MACNEILL Now you do what we tell you or we 'll have your knavish life . ALSTON And I 'll have your lives , so help me God ! ( He stands looking darkly at PEGGY , his head bent to one side . ) So you are a Tory . p. 39 MACLEAN ( Shaking her head . ) I 'm not a Tory , and I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , I think . But I love her for standing firm for what she thinks is right . Yes , Aunt Flora , I 'm on the other side now , but I 'm for you yourself in spite of it . ( The tears glistening in her eyes . ) You may stand here , Cousin Alec , and see your own kin taken out to be hanged , but I wo n't . Aunt Flora has mothered me , cared for me , and I have loved her for the greatness that 's in her . And I 'll fight to protect her . Colonel Alston , give up that sword ! ALSTON ( Snarling . ) I will not . MACNEILL You wo n't , eh ? ( She hurries over and stands by PEGGY 'S side . ) You put that sword on the table , you villian , or I 'll take this gun and blow your brains out . Put it there . ( She reaches out for the gun . ALSTON looks at the Two WOMEN . PEGGY 'S hand gradually draws back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ALSTON bows his head and finally lays the sword on the table . ) ALSTON ( Muttering . ) You 'll pay for this  --  all of you ! You 'll pay ! MACNEILL ( Grabbing up the sword . ) Shut your dirty mouth and behave yourself . Maybe I wo n't stop at cutting your shirt off . I might cut your lips off . ( She runs her fingers with testing bloodthirstiness along the edge of the blade . SANDY whines and shudders and peeps out from behind his fingers at the scene. ) p. 40 MACLEAN Colonel Alston , I want your word as a soldier that you will go and leave this house in peace . ALSTON ( Grimly . ) I promise that , my girl , but I will leave it in the ashes of peace . MACNEILL Then you will burn with it . Get a rope quick , Jamie  --  quick . ( JAMES runs over to the chest and fetches out a stout rope . ) MACDONALD Jamie ! MACNEILL ( Snatching the rope . ) Keep your tongue out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already . ( Threateningly to ALSTON . ) All right , make up your mind . ALSTON I promise nothing . And if you dare tie me with that rope  --  MACNEILL Tie you ! We 're going to hang you high as Haman on one of them curtain hooks there . And while you 're a-swinging there I might souse this sword up to the hilt into your rotten stinking insides . Will you go on and let us alone , or wo n't you ? ALSTON No , my men are around this house . MACNEILL And I reckon you 've heard of hostages , ai n't you ? Well , you 're a hostage , and before your men ever break in that door you 'll be kicking your last on that floor like a stuck pig . Once more we ask you to swear you 'll leave us in peace . ( ALSTON shakes his head . ) You 're as bull-headed as Flory . ( She moves behind him and pricks him with the sword . ) Swear ! ( But ALSTON remains motionless. ) p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge you with responsibility in this . MACALLISTER ( With a faint touch of sarcasm . ) I 'm afraid it 's entirely a military matter and in your hands . ALSTON You have authority . Put an end to this childish nonsense . MACNEILL Childish , is it ? Then we 'll treat you like a child  --  spank you . ( She whams him across the rear with the flat of the sword . He suddenly roars and jerks himself up straight . ) And once more . ( She whams him again . He yells . ) ALSTON ( Panting . ) I warn you , Mr. MacAllister . MACALLISTER One angry Scotch woman is bad enough . But when you get two after you the only thing to do is yield . Colonel Alston , I promise you that the Committee will bring Flora MacDonald before it legally to answer for her deeds . I advise you to leave the house in peace . ALSTON ( Mopping his face with his sleeve . ) And from your behavior I 'm beginning to suspect your loyalty to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 42 ALSTON I do . MACALLISTER That is an insult . ALSTON And I mean it to be . MACALLISTER By heavens , no man has ever questioned my loyalty to the colonies . Nor shall you . ALSTON Then disprove it by acting accordingly . MACALLISTER ( Moving in front of ALSTON , his gaunt heavy frame drawn fiercely up . ) Take back your words . Take them back or I 'll  --  I 'll prefer charges against you . I 'll go in person to Generals Caswell and Lillington and strip your rank from you . I 'll  --  ( He sputters with anger and lifts his riding whip . ) Apologize . ALSTON ( Coldly , after a moment . ) Very well , I apologize then . ( MACALLISTER lowers his whip . ) MACNEILL Go ahead and horse whip him , Alec . You 'd have at least one star in your crown if no more . ( HOOFBEATS are heard flooding up to the door outside . ) MACALLISTER And now , Peggy , put aside that gun . MACLEAN ( Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has made no promise yet . I mean what I say . I will never let him harm Aunt Flora . p. 43 MACNEILL We 'll kill him first , one of us will . ( A HAMMERING sets up on the rear door . ALSTON smiles vengefully . ) ALSTON We 'll see who gets killed . MACLEAN Command your men to march on down the road , Colonel Alston . You will join them . ( The BANGING on the door is repeated . SANDY shrinks away farther into the room . ) ALSTON ( Calling out loudly . ) Break the door down ! SANDY ( Squealing . ) Ah , Lord , Lord  --  here comes the flood of damnation . VOICE ( Outside . ) Heigh there ! Mistress Flora ! SANDY ( Quaveringly . ) And now ' its destruction piles upon us . That 's Dan Murchison 's voice . ( The face of a YOUNG MAN appears at the rear window . ) See , there he is . ( MACALLISTER hurries over and unbars the door , and in an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young fellow of twenty-four or five , dressed in the uniform of a captain in the American Continental army . His face and figure show the strain of his hard riding . His clothes are spattered with mud. ) p. 44 MACNEILL Well , Dan Murchison , I hope I 'm glad to see you . ( She staggers over to a seat , sits down with the sword across her lap and begins fanning herself furiously with her apron . DAN looks about the room and his eyes fasten on PEGGY 'S face . ) MURCHISON ( Saluting . ) Colonel Alston  --  Mr. MacAllister . ( ALSTON returns his salute . ) MACALLISTER Thank God you 've arrived in time . And the order , Dan ? MURCHISON ( Still looking at PEGGY . ) It was granted . What 's happened ? MACNEILL Ah , Lord in heaven , you 've saved Peggy from shooting the lights out of old Alston . MURCHISON ( To PEGGY , his face lighted with a smile . ) You , Mistress Peggy ? MACNEILL Aye , as stout-hearted a lass as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that weapon now , girl . MACNEILL Do n't you do it , Peggy , not till Dan says so . MURCHISON ( Hurrying over to PEGGY . ) You 're crying . p. 45 MACLEAN I  --  No , it 's nothing . ( She gives him a swift look and then bows her head , her shoulders shaking as she tries to keep herself from breaking down . The gun slides from her grasp and lies on the table . DAN stares at her , and then his hand goes out and touches her on the arm . ) MURCHISON ( His voice low and tender . ) Ah , Peggy MacLean , please , you must n't cry now . It 's all right . It is ! MACNEILL This hard-headed Flora was going out to get herself hanged for her king , and Peggy was all set to kill somebody before she 'd let it happen . I was too . ( To ALSTON . ) Ai n't you ashamed of yourself ? Scat now and make yourself scarce . ALSTON Captain Murchison , that young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer 's life . MACNEILL She 's not a Tory . You heard her say so . MACALLISTER Aye , Dan , she 's declared herself for our side . MURCHISON ( Still gazing at PEGGY . ) She 's in my protection , Colonel Alston , no matter whose side she 's on . ALSTON As your superior officer , Captain Murchison , I command you to assist me in securing these prisoners . ( He reaches towards JENNIE BAN for his sword , but she grabs it up and cuts savagely at him . He jerks his hand away . ) And that includes you , you old bell-cow. p. 46 MACNEILL Mess with me , you snapping turtle , and you wo n't have a claw left to scratch with . MURCHISON ( Standing near to PEGGY , now as if oblivious to the others in the room . ) All that long road and the riding . It seemed I 'd never get here . Like years it is I 've been away from home  --  and from you . Tchk , and I asked you not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heart-sick about you , afraid for you out here unprotected in these woods . And now I 'm here seeing you again , and you 're safe from harm , and  --  and beautiful , more beautiful than before . ( Her voice dies out as he continues gazing at her . ) MACLEAN ( Looking up at him through her tears . ) And Aunt Flora , you 'll save her , Dan ? That 's what matters most . MURCHISON And she is saved  --  her life is . Yes , there 's something else that matters too , Peggy . You and me  --  my love for you . I tell you now , I love you . ( He smiles at her and then bending down kisses her . For a moment he holds her hand tightly , looking deep into her face . She suddenly buries her head against his shoulder and clings to him . FLORA sits staring as if unseeingly ahead of her . JENNIE BAN smiles broadly about her. ) p. 47 MACLEAN ( Brokenly . ) Night and day I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart aching for you . I 've been a fool , I know it . And in my pride I struggled against it , fought against it . And now you 're back and I 'm glad , glad , Dan . I love you . MURCHISON ( Kissing her hair , almost whispering . ) And like a star you 've been above me , Peggy MacLean . But now you 're real enough , close enough . And in the new day we 're fighting for all the old differences will be wiped away . There wo n't be any high and any low , some sitting up near the throne of God , and some the dregs of the earth , slaves and bondservants the way I 've been and walked in shame and my father before me . There 'll be a chance for every man to prove himself . ( Vehemently . ) And I 'll prove myself for you , Peggy , I will . MACLEAN ( Murmuring , her face alight . ) It 's I must prove myself , Dan . MURCHISON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crust to my name , with nothing but the future ahead , nothing to offer you but my love and the strength of my two arms . But they will win a place for you , they will win it for you somehow . ( He holds her close to him . ) ALSTON ( After a moment , satirically . ) I congratulate you and the young lady , Captain Murchison , now that you seem to be in each other 's cuddling keeping . ( Seriously . ) You could n't have chosen a braver one , young Captain . Nor you a braver man , Mistress MacLean . ( To FLORA . ) And now , Madam , we will resume our little matter . p. 48 MURCHISON ( Turning to ALSTON . ) I have orders from General Lillington , sir . The prisoners are in my charge . ALSTON ( Giving him a searching look . ) I deny you that . MURCHISON Flora MacDonald 's life is to be spared . ( He hands him a crumpled dispatch which he still holds in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long while . Then he wads it up and crams it into his pocket . DAN reaches for it . He hands it reluctantly back . The SERGEANT appears in the rear door . ) A SERGEANT ( Saluting with his forefinger to his cap . ) Yessir , premises all clear , Cap'n . ALSTON ( With a shout . ) " Yessir ! " " Yessir ! " How many times do I have to remind you I 've been promoted ? I 'm a colonel now . ( The SERGEANT blinks at him . ) A SERGEANT ( Touching his cap spasmodically as he backs away . ) Yessir . ALSTON And quit saluting with one finger ! A SERGEANT ( Disappearing . ) Yessir  --  Captain ! ( ALSTON whirls towards the door and then turns back. ) p. 49 ALSTON ( To JENNIE BAN . ) Old woman , I 'll trouble you for my sword . MACNEILL Oh , no you wo n't . This is a famous sword now . I 'm going to keep it for my grandchildren  --  tell ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one summer 's day in the long ago . ALSTON I have been shamed to undoing and my pride humbled in the dust by a couple of women , Captain Murchison . I want my sword back . ( He spits in sudden disgust on the floor . ) SANDY ( Now crowding himself eagerly forward . ) And a famous sword already , is it ? Well , what about my musket ? Nanh , nanh , do n't leave it out . You seen it with your own two eyes , Dan  --  how it was p'inted straight at the rapscallion 's raging heart . All ready to go off , it was , and let wind through the bully 's breast , for defense of Mistress Flora . And how air ye , Dan ? ( Now beginning to babble from his long repression . ) I 've been a-thinking on ye , and laying a prayer now and then on the doorstep of heaven to keep you safe wherever ye might be . And now to think of it  --  Mistress Peggy a-biding here till you come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . Wonderful it is , Dan , wonderful . ( He grabs DAN 'S hand and flops it heartily up and down. ) p. 50 MURCHISON And greetings to you , Sandy . SANDY ( Taking PEGGY 'S hand and kissing it . ) Aye , a wonder of a lad he is , and the darling of Carolina you be . Now I give over and stand out no more against him after his saving Mistress Flora this day . And do n't you , Mistress , for so ' t was all intended . And one look at Mistress Peggy 's rosy pink face , fresh as a sunbeam kissing ' mongst the flowers , tells me who she loves . Happy as singing birds they 'll be , the both of them . They will , Mistress Flora . And poor Master Donald and his powdered wig must needs rest in his grave finished and forgot . ( He picks up his musket , pats it , and backs away towards the door at the Left . Stopping by COLONEL ALSTON who has been watching JENNIE BAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself fiercely up . ) Out with ye , old man ! ( ALSTON draws back his hand as if to strike him , and SANDY flees over to SIMEY again . ) ALSTON ( Sharply . ) Good day to you all . And , Captain Murchison , see that your orders are carried out , and at once . MURCHISON Yes . ALSTON ( Bowing to FLORA . ) You 're a brave and noble woman , Madam , and worth a regiment of soldiers to any cause . I regret I was denied the pleasure of hanging you . ( He salutes and turns to go away . Suddenly he springs back , snatches the sword out of JENNIE BAN 'S lap , and goes out chuckling heavily. ) p. 51 MACNEILL ( Half-bounding out of her chair and then sinking back again . ) The scoundel ! He ai n't got a bit of manners . He even spat on the floor . ALSTON ( Angry and loud outside . ) Form ranks ! ( There is the sound of trampling FEET as his troop is heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sigh . ) Well , there he goes , praise the Lord God , and we 're still alive . MACALLISTER Once more it seems Providence has intervened to save you , Flora . Now will you take warning and  --  MACNEILL She 's been persecuted enough for one day , Alec MacAllister . Let her alone . MACALLISTER True , her life has been spared , but not more than that . MACNEILL And that 's enough . Now let 's set down and eat together as friends . It 's all over and ended now . Sandy , fetch in more firewood , you and Simey , to build up the fire . MACALLISTER But the judgment of the state still stands against her . MACDONALD ( Quietly . ) No , Cousin Jennie , it 's not ended and done with yet . But it soon will be , and I pray so , ( Looking up at DAN coldly . ) Strange the working in this new land , Dan Murchison . ( Smiling wrily . ) You 're still my enemy , my former bound boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there you stand with your arm about my once proud niece . Ah , rather had I been blinded utterly before my eyes had witnessed the shame of it . p. 52 MACLEAN ( With almost a cry . ) Aunt Flora ! MACDONALD No , Peggy , there 's nothing for you to say . You 've said it all , your face shows it all . And each of us must go her appointed way now . Your life is beginning , mine draws to a close . What do you wish of me , Dan Murchison ? MURCHISON General Lillington has sent horses , ma'am , for your use  --  in the road out there . MACDONALD The general is very kind . MURCHISON And I wish  --  I wish I could leave you here to live in peace , but I can not . His orders are for you to take the oath , both you and your household , or leave  --  at once . ( He looks at her , his seamy young face filled with sorrow . ) MACALLISTER Now you see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice but to take the oath . MACNEILL The oath ! The oath ! Will you quit using that word ? MACALLISTER Then let her bow her stubborn heart . MACDONALD Again you waste your empty words , Cousin Alec . ( Firmly . ) Then we will leave . JAMES Mother ! MACDONALD Yes , Jamie , we will go . p. 53 JAMES And what 's to become of all we 've done here ?  --  our house , our barns and fields ? MACALLISTER ( Sternly . ) They will be confiscated by the government , that 's what , and transferred to someone more worthy of them . As a member of the Committee I shall determine who . JAMES If you take them from us , Cousin Alec , may God curse you for it . MACDONALD When peace is restored , Jamie lad , and we have won this war , we 'll have them back again . And here we 'll gather once more , you father and brother , and we 'll go on as we have started . Till then  --  in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma'am . But the orders say the oath , or lacking that you 'll leave these shores . MACLEAN Dan ! MURCHISON And return to Scotland or some other British land . It is a hard verdict , I know . MACALLISTER But a just one . MURCHISON And surely you 'll sign it now , ma'am , for the war will soon be won . ( Jubilantly as he pulls a paper from his pocket . ) The general sends this message to you , Mr. MacAllister . ( He hands the paper to MACALLISTER who spreads it out and runs his eyes over it . ) It has just been received from the north . p. 54 MACALLISTER ( Reading abstractly , then light breaking over his face . ) Listen , Flora , everybody . " We therefore do solemnly publish and declare that these united colonies are , and of right ought to be , free and independent States . " ( Triumphantly . ) They 've done it . Congress has declared independence . MACNEILL Thank the Lord , thank the Lord for that anyhow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will , ma'am , and we 'll fight harder than ever now to make it so . MACALLISTER Aye , boy , we will . ( Staring ahead of him , his voice tremulous with feeling . ) Now everywhere let the people shout for joy , the bells be rung . Let thanksgivings be said in the churches , bonfires lit across the land , to mark this glorious event , a time to be recorded in all future history . MURCHISON They are , Mr. MacAllister . Last night the town of Cross Creek was a blaze of light . Your own kinsmen , ma'am , joined in the parade . MACALLISTER And everywhere the Tories will be laying down their arms now , deserting their evil cause . Ah , Flora , my prayers are answered at last . Read it , girl , read it and know that right has triumphed . Your struggle is ended now and you can give over at the last . ( He pushes the paper into her hands. ) p. 55 MACDONALD ( Almost inaudibly . ) I will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bending above FLORA , her voice stricken and pleading . ) Please , Mother , we 've got to give in . Please let us stay here , keep our home . JAMES Do it , Mother . ( They stand on either side of her . ) We want to bide here . MACDONALD ( Gazing before her as they watch her . ) So with these words and these deeds you destroy our dream , for now it is destroyed . Ah , more than that , the hopes of the world . And you , Alec MacAllister , Dan Murchison and Peggy , your children 's children and their children will see some day how wrong you 've been . In my heart I know it . And because I know it I 'll still stand true to the belief that 's in me and in my poor husband . You say swear obedience to this or take the consequences . I 'll take the consequences  --  whatever they may be . ( She grinds the document in her hand and throws it on the floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unseen listener . ) You 'll see the meaning of this liberty you talk about  --  how the states will quarrel among themselves , civil war be bred and the land overrun , how the rich will oppress the poor because they 'll have the power to do it . How greed and avarice will flourish , waste and confusion , because they are free to . ( Her words soaring more impassioned through the air . ) Freedom ! Freedom ! And the voice of the people  --  ah , the people , the riff-raff , the ignorant  --  will be bought and sold like cattle in the marketplace , and the land will be gutted and ruined and the treasures of the mountains and the forests rooted up as if by swine . And this nation of liberty and free men you talk of will become a land of demagogues and office-seekers and bloated slave-drivers . And so it 's ended now . All the old days are ended . And what might have been a great and glorious empire of English men and women is broken and destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nothing to do now  --  nothing else to do  --  but to deny this land and turn our faces back to the old world , there  --  to die . ( Shaking her head . ) I 'll get my shawl , Dan Murchison . Jamie  --  Anne . ( She turns and goes out at the Left Front . ANNE and JAMES hesitate a moment and then follow after her . The GROUP stand in heavy silence for an instant . MACALLISTER picks the document up from the floor and carefully smooths it out in his hand. ) p. 56 MACNEILL Her life and soul is in them words . ( Halfweeping . ) And her poor heart is broken , this day it is . ( Angrily . ) For what you 've done , Alec MacAllister , I 'd say God blast you , but it ai n't no use . MACALLISTER ( Sadly but decisively . ) Not now , Jennie Ban . Justice has won . MACNEILL Justice  --  ah  --  ( She grabs up a straw broom from the corner and begins sweeping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAN 'S arm . ) I ca n't stand it , her face . To see her look like that . MURCHISON Nothing can be done about it , nothing . She wo n't give in . MACLEAN ( Shuddering . ) Hearing her talk like that about the future  --  for a moment it almost frightened me . She seemed like a sort of prophet seeing far ahead . MURCHISON She 's suffered so . And she 's wrong , that 's why she 's suffered . From the beginning she was wrong and her words were wrong . Ah , Peggy , it has to be like that  --  the weak have to give way and the wrong ideas have to give way . It 's cruel , but it 's so  --  and it wo n't be like she said . ( Fiercely . ) My country wo n't . We 'll build it different . Out of her very tears we 'll build it  --  into something great and wonderful . p. 57 MACALLISTER ( Buoyantly . ) Aye , lad , we will . Mistakes will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the glory of it  --  and what she 'll never see  --  is that we ourselves have the power to change these mistakes , to wipe out these evils  --  to make our country what we want it to be . ( Staring before him . ) Aye , that 's it , we ourselves free men , like this document says , and responsible men , both to ourselves and the generations that come after us  --  responsible in the terms of that very freedom . We must never forget that , and our children must never forget . ( His strong and vibrant voice booming through the room as he looks ahead of him . ) Yea , with these living words and these deeds we begin our empire , Dan Murchison and Peggy MacNeill  --  an empire not of oppression and hate and power spreading over the world , but of justice , courage , and peace among men . And in the symbol of you two  --  it is like our young country beginning  --  ( His voice dies out and he gazes a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , Alec MacAllister , you 've got this liberty and got it bad . You sound like Parson MacLeod and his gospel . MACALLISTER And it is the gospel . ( He wipes his eyes. ) p. 58 MACNEILL ( Shaking her head . ) Listening to Flory there , for a minute it seemed in all this mommick and mixtry of beliefs that she was right and had the truth  --  her and her sheltering plaid . And now seeing you , Dan and Peggy , standing there with the light on you , looking so young and hopeful  --  seems like you 're right . MURCHISON And we are right . MACALLISTER They are . And the principle of liberty in this new nation shall be the true sheltering plaid for oppressed mankind . Well , good night , Jennie Ban . I must hurry back to Cross Creek . I 'll not say a last farewell to Flora . ( He turns and holds out his hand to JENNIE BAN . With sluggish reluctance she finally takes it and then returns hurriedly to sweeping the hearth though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear door . ) Get them safely on board ship in Wilmington , Dan . Even in her defeat I respect her . ( Sighing . ) Ah , it could have been different . MURCHISON ( Saluting . ) I will , sir . ( MACALLISTER goes out . The door closes behind him . ) MACNEILL ( In angry frustration . ) It 's wrong , all wrong . If somebody could only spank some sense into her head . ( Glaring up at SANDY who is still standing over at the Left like a bony old sick bird . ) And you , you old hypocrite , what 'll happen to you now ? Will you be going back with her in all your bravery across the raging water ? p. 59 SANDY I will not . ( Shivering . ) I wo n't cross them waters again . I wo n't . And I ca n't help pore missus now . ( SIMEY grunts . ) SIMEY Oohm  --  oohm  --  SANDY Yeah , we 'll go , tomorrow we will . ( Staring off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my trusty musket . We 've been talking about it for weeks now . To the west , over the mountains , clean away from all this . There among the Indians we 'll live with the prairie dogs and buffalo and forget all this , forget all this and be free , really free . MACNEILL Well , dang it , you may be right . SANDY And we are right . ( Staring off . ) First in Scotland they swore me fast and made me make my mark of blood for the king  --  writing me down in a great book forever . And finally , who knows ?  --  There maybe by a river rolling from the great Pacific mountains down they 'll put me up a monument and cut our name in the ' mortality of everlasting stone  --  " Sandy and Simey Ochiltree , of the Clan Ochiltree , first pioneers in the building of the west . There they sleep side by side . " Ah , Simey boy , the wonder of it ! ( FLORA comes in from the Left with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bundle under her arm . Following her are ANNE and JAMES. ) p. 60 MACDONALD We are ready , Dan Murchison . MURCHISON The horses are waiting , ma'am . SANDY Goodbye , Mistress Flora , goodbye . ( He runs up and bows brokenly over her hand , kissing it . ) MACDONALD Thank you , Sandy . And you and Simey will stay here . SANDY Aye , ma'am , it 's all fixed what we 'll do  --  all fixed . MACDONALD Peggy and Dan , I leave all this to you . The place is yours . MACLEAN No , Aunt Flora . We do n't want it , no . MACDONALD And here where we would live you must live . There is a laurel tree I planted by the spring . See that it lives . MACLEAN ( Weeping . ) Yes , yes . MACLEOD ( Suddenly seizing PEGGY 'S arm . ) And the grave , Peggy ! My child  --  care for it . ( PEGGY nods her head . ) MURCHISON Aye . ( They go out at the rear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden stir as she is left alone . ) I wo n't stay here another night . ( She lifts the kettle from the fire and flings down the poker , calling . ) I 'll ride with you far as home ! ( She hurries out after the others . For a moment the Stage is empty and silent , shadowed down now with the twilight falling over the fields . Presently FLORA appears in the door . She gazes heavily about the room , then stands staring at the portrait of the king . She reaches up and turns it on its wire to face against the wall . Taking the flag from the table she hugs it against her . Once more she gazes in farewell about her and then goes swiftly out with the flag and disappears into the gloom. )
