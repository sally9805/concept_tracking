Vincenzo Bellini 's 1831 opera Norma is one of the Matterhorns of the repertory for sopranos . Many of the world 's finest singers have come to grief on its melodic precipices because they lacked the bel canto technique , emotional projection , and soaringly powerful voice that the title role requires . The 19th century Soprano Lilli Lehmann said it was easier to sing three Brnnhildes than one Norma , and the great French Prima Donna Pauline Viardot was so obsessed with the difficulties of the part that the last word she spoke on her deathbed was " Norma . " Maria Callas has scaled the role , though rarely without lapses along the way , and often with a sense of straining bravely beyond her vocal limits . <P> Yet last week in Manhattan 's Carnegie Hall , 24-year-old Greek Soprano Elena Suliotis went about rehearsing a concert version of Norma with the American Opera Society as if she had never heard any of this . Her attitude : " What is there to be afraid of ? " She soon found out . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its midst not only a daunting array of singers from the past but also the diva of divas , Callas , enthroned in a corner box . Immediately the entire house turned in claque-like obeisance to Callas ; galvanized by her magnetic presence , they applauded and cheered as she blew kisses and tossed them the roses that lined the tier . Then she went backstage to greet her compatriot with " Brava ! Brava ! Brava ! " But now she had created a supercharged atmosphere that was as much of a challenge to Suliotis as the opera itself . <P> Till then , Suliotis ' performance had been uneven : ravishing in some spots , somewhat ravaging in others . As the second act got under way , her vocal lines became tangled with Soprano Nancy Tatum 's in a tricky cabaletta , Si , fino all'ore , estreme ; she reached for a high C , missed , and hid her face behind her arm in chagrin . A sour chorus of boos accompanied her exit . Suddenly , in the middle of the act , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the audience murmuring in confusion . Suliotis had asked for an unscheduled intermission in order to pull herself together-and let the audience cool down a bit . It must have worked . She returned-eyes flashing , pacing the stage like a tigress-and finished the act with a fiery , rafter-ringing performance . <P> Her recovery showed that Suliotis has the temperament of a true diva . She has the vocal equipment too-power , range , a rich , natural voice and a keen instinct for drama-but at this stage of her career it is marred by an occasional lack of control , exaggerated effects and some forcing at both extremes of her range . Also , she may be gambling with her voice 's future by singing taxing roles at such an early age . Still , such all-or-nothing assaults on the heights are in the spirit of Callas ' own career , and the older soprano may have been acknowledging the kinship when she tried to quiet the boos at Carnegie Hall by shouting the Greek word for " good " : " Kalla !
