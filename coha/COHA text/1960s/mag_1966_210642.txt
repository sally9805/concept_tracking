The citizens of Detroit built their first museum of art eight years before they built their first automobile back in 1896 . They have been restyling both ever since . The first acquisition of the Detroit Institute of Arts was a $2,500 mythological oil called Reading the Story of Oenone , an object lesson in severe academia by U.S. Artist Francis D. Millet . Final proof that the museum subsequently made greater and more thorough acquisitions had to wait until last week when it opened its new $3,785,000 wing , doubling previous gallery space . <P> Before , space was so tight that Millet 's Oenone hung in a rack in the basement - which , considering its slick blah-ness , was not a bad idea . There are plenty of other works that deserve to be seen : six Rembrandts , for example - including Henry Ford IIs gift , A Woman Weeping . The museum has Jan van Eyck 's St. Jerome in His Study and Rogier van der Weyden 's St. Jerome in the Desert , both dating from the Renaissance . There are also such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a 5 ft. by 6 ft. altarpiece by the evanescent baroque master Giovanni Battista Tiepolo . <P> Snook Cocker . Detroit 's American panorama ranks among the best in U.S. museumdom , from a version of John Singleton Copley 's 1778 Havana harbor scene Watson and the Shark to Whis tler 's impressionistic Nocturne in Black and Gold : the Falling Rocket . Many such acquisitions occurred during the 21-year administration of the museum 's late Director William R. Valentiner , onetime assistant at Berlin 's Kaiser-Friedrich Museum and a Met curator , who died in 1958 . Valentiner provided the museum with highly professional personnel and standards . By way of relief , Valentiner also had a capacity for snook-cockers . In 1932 , he and Edsel B. Ford got the Mexican Communist revolutionary , Diego Rivera , to paint murals of the city 's industries in the museum 's garden court . Rivera slyly turned one worker-model 's head , whose hat bore a sign saying " We Want Beer , " so that it read just " We Want . " Detroit citizens huffed and puffed about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Rivera " was trying to express his idea of the spirit of Detroit . " <P> Fords were still in the forefront of the black-tie throng of 513 patrons and benefactors on hand for last week 's $100-a-plate inaugural . In particular , there was Mrs. Edsel B. Ford , 70 , who gave $1,000,000 toward the three-story , polished granite building , and then refused to let the wing be named for her or to give a speech after dinner in the 60-ft. - tall , slate-floored sculpture court . <P> Coo Wha Zee . To appreciate it all , Museum Director Willis Woods led such guests as Detroit Mayor Jerome Cavanagh through the new galleries . There for the admiring were 13 brand-new acquisitions , ranging from two 5,000-year-old Cycladic figures to Miro 's surreal Autoportrait II . Other works unveiled that evening were Chicago Realist Ivan Le Lorraine Albright 's 1926 Burgomaster with A Key ( see opposite page ) and Nicolas de Largilliere 's 1703 Portrait of an Alderman of Paris , the $50,000 gift of a cousin of Mrs. Ford 's , Ernest Kanzler.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
