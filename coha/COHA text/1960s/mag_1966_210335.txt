What 's wrong with bathrooms ? <P> Just about everything , according to a six-year , $100,000 study just completed by Cornell University . And the worst offender of all is that old unmentionable , the toilet . Not only has it not changed basically since plumbing began to move indoors , but it remains " the most ill-suited fixture ever designed . " The most natural position , Architecture Professor Alexander Kira and his four assistants discovered after exhaustive research , is squatting . " We may think it is outrageous to squat , " says Kira , " but most of the world squats . It is more natural and easier on the body . " <P> Kira 's radical proposal is more down to earth : the seat should be just 9 inches high v. about 16 inches for the conventional toilet . For better hygiene , he advocates washing jets fore and aft . The seat itself would be wider , padded , and come with built-in push-up bars , paper holder and electric flush controls . And while on the subject , Kira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with everything from splash diagrams to trajectory charts , the study group proposes a cavern-shaped urinal , suggests that it might pull down from the wall above . <P> Out with Faucets . The Cornell project got underway when Kira discovered that " kitchens have been researched to death ; someone does a study every year . But the bathroom has been left alone . " Starting from scratch , the Cornell researchers conducted a questionnaire survey of 1,000 Los Angeles families , found that " once people got talking about bathrooms , they could n't stop . " <P> Sinks , it appears , are too small and too low . They should be higher and wider . Present faucets should be replaced by a recessed fountain-type water source . The bowl should have a splash lip at the front and be contoured to set up a swirling , self-cleaning water action . <P> Tubs are now fit for no one . They should be longer and contoured to the bather 's body . More hand holds and a nonslip surface are needed to reduce accidents . Since washing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand sprays are proposed to allow bathers to step out of the tub completely cleansed . <P> No More Slipping . Showers are too small ; they should be larger , have a built-in seat , and be enclosed to the ceiling except for the entrance . Different-shaped handles , square for hot and round for cold , would permit the soapy-eyed bather to adjust water temperature without alternately scalding or freezing himself . To avoid slipping while balancing on one leg , a continuous wraparound safety bar is needed . " One can get a car washed automatically in five minutes , while it still takes us 15 minutes to wash ourselves by hand , " Kira notes wryly , and predicts that sweeping technological changes are due in personal hygiene . <P> Already , he points out , automation has taken over in the bathroom-gadget department , with everything from electric toothbrushes and toothpicks to hair dryers and whirlpool agitators . More mechanized conveniences are surely coming . More important , he hopes that his report has finally lifted the " veil of embarrassment , " and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathroom is conceived of and produced as an entity , " Kira maintains , " no significant progress can be made .
