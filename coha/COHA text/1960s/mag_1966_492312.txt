TV MADNESS Hollywood is gambling a record $30 million on television pilot productions -- over 100 new series for next fall , of which a score may make it to your screen . Every once in a while , usually on a Sunday evening , a strange private film festival lakes place at the ABC television studios in Hollywood . Filing into a projection room , a group of ABC officials watch three or four hours ' worth of television shows which have never been on the air and never will be . Some of the shows are as good as the pap that flows over the airwaves today  --  but others are infinitely better . They have been resurrected from a lonely storeroom deep in the recesses of the studio , and among them are some obvious favorites of the assembled executives . As they watch the films , you can hear groans , laughter and muttered comments ?

In the coming few weeks , over 100 new shows like these will also be interred , Their commitment to the film repositories will be the final act in a peculiar madness which takes possession of the television industry every winter . The madness is called " the pilot season , " and its principal symptom is an uncontrollable obsession to waste money . As you read this , for example , some $25 million of hard-earned TV capital is inexorably going up the Hollywood spout . This is the amount spent to make pilot films ? sample episodes  --  for TV seri , - you will eel see on your screens next fall .

" This year 's bumper harvest of pilots  --  ranging in theme from the adventures of an Iroquois detective on the New York City police force to those of a Missouri butcher contesting a piece of real estate with the 1 .

It inevitably brings on a tendency for producers . networks and advertis-ers. with such a huge investment involved . to play it supersafe  --  imitating " sure-fire " but tired formulas and assuring season after season that mediocrity will continue to breed more mediocrity .

These names come from the fact that if a $200,000 pilot sells as a network series and survives . its producer , writers and stars can automatically become millionaires . Pilot mad- therefore , is akin to compulsive gambling , chronic insomnia , delusions of grandeur . persecution fantasies , and twitches of the check-writing pen . In December , at the height of this year 's pilot agony , Harve Bennett , ABC 's West Coast Director of Program Development , met me for breakfast at the unusual hour of seven A.%1. , to evade pursuing producers . " I do n't have time to get a cold until May , " he explained . " I ca n't answer two hundred phone calls a day . " Perry Lafferty . CBS 's West Coast vice president in charge of programs , said , " This whole town is crazy . Producers and writers accost me in parking lots and even in the men 's room . I 've had three suits nearly torn off my back . When 1 try to play catch with my son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait to sell me a pilot idea . " In the office of William Self , head of TV programming at 20th Century-Fox , his entire eight-foot couch seemed to be upholstered with manuscripts . " Ideas for pilots , " he explained wearily . " Just one week 's worth . " In pilot time , ordinarily stable people tend toward loony behavior . This year , for example , Talent Associates and CBS jointly financed a pilot for a half-hour series called Run . Buddy , Run . a spoof of the successful Fugitive series . It concernsa man , played by Jack Sheldon , who overhears a syndicate murder being planned and then for the rest of the series has to flee from Mafia retribution . Over at NBC there is another half-hour pilot from Universal , called Run . Jack , Run . This also . by admission , is a spoof on The Fugitive and stars David Astor and Adam Keefe as two men who inadvertently are involved in a Mafia murder and spend the rest of their series running away from the mob . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet each plunged blindly and stubbornly ahead . The combined cost of the two pilots is nearly a half million dollars . Although such close duplication can be fatal , Run , Buddy , Run as of now is on the CBS fall schedule . A prime manifestation of pilot mania is a compulsion to imitate something else that is already successful . When Get Smart ! . this year 's series about a bumbling secret agent , hit it big in the ratings . an even dozen ideas involving other bumblers popped up in the new pilot crop . There is Larry Blyden , a bumbling insurance investigator in CBS-United Artists ' Green For Action ; Richard Mulligan , as a bumbling Western star in NBC-Talent Associates ' The Hero ; and a whole family of bumblers in ABC-Universal 's The Clumbsys , This season 's hit , Hogan 's Heroes ! about a rollicking group of P.O.W.

Bewitched . The Beatles . Gilligan 's Island , Bonanza , Last in Space . Combat . 12 O'clock High . Batman and assorted comic strips . Besides imitation , another gambit is to try to cash in on the success of a star in an established series . This is called " capitalizing on the track record " ? no matter how ludicrous the new pilot role may be for the star .

Horton. a very hot TV personality because of his long run in Tl'agon Train , had , in the year since he had left that series , considered and rejected nearly WO pilots . This one interested him , however . The Aubrey-Dorso-Aurthur series was to be called Mark Dolphin . As Horton tells the story , he was in Boston rehearsing for his starring role in the Broadway musical , 110 in the Shade , when he was visited by the triumvirate . " They discussed the pilot with me. " says Horton , " and Aubrey made it very clear that the show was a cinch for CBS for either 1964-65 , or 1965-66. depending on the length of my Broadway run in HO in the Shade . They gave me a script to read , and it was very good . It was written by Richard Nash , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Rainmaker , on which the musical was based . It was just the kind TV MADNESS of role I had been looking for after years in West-ems . The hero . Mark Dolphin , was a suave New York multimillionaire living in a Park Avenue penthouse . He involved himself in people 's problems and solved them for them . Dolphin had a charming off-beat personality . so I signed to do the pilot . It was a great deal . I would have had **26;2477;TOOLONG percent of the profits plus a big weekly salary . " 310 in the Shade opened on Broadway , and it was a hit . It was then agreed that since the show would run for at least a year , the Mark Dolphin pilot would be made in 196-1 for the 1965-66 season . " Until then . " says Horton. " everything seemed fine . But from that point on . an incredible series of events began to happen . " First , according to Horton , the producers of the pilot asked him to pick his own director , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foul-up on the starting date . Without informing Horton , they scheduled shooting to begin when he was committed to rehearsing an appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show . Horton says . " They had already hired Michael Rennie . Shirley Knight and Lew Ayres to begin work that week at salaries totaling thirty thousand dollars . I just could n't get out of my Ed Sullivan commitment , so the thirty thousand dollars went down the drain for lack of a ten-cent phone call . " When I was able to clear time to do the pilot , " Horton continues , " they hired the actors again for another thirty thousand dollars , and then they gave me my shooting script , which Aurthur proudly said had been rewritten a dozen times . I could hardly believe what I saw . Instead of a suave millionaire , I was now playing a tough Humphrey Bogart character who owns an antique shop in New York . Putting me in a role like that would be like asking Mickey Rooney to play a pro-football tackle . I phoned my agent and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . ' I ca n't . If you do n't do the pilot now . CBS can sue you for everything you own. ? So Horton went hack to finish the pilot , and one calamity piled upon another . An entire wardrobe of hand-tailored black mohair suits was ordered at a cost of thousands of dollars , but when the cameraman saw them they all had to be discarded because the glistening black photographed with a halo around it . A whole day 's shooting had to be canceled because there was no permit from the city to film in the streets of New York . " Worst of all . " says Horton. ' ' they kept rewriting the script , and it got more and more awful . We redid scene after scene , and the costs kept mounting . Soon the budget was over six hundred thousand dollars for a one-hour show . Later I was told that the total cost ran to nearly seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars , and Academy Award-winning movies have been made for less than that .

So do the TV subsidiaries of the movie studios , which . in addition . comb through their old films looking for possible series pegs . This year , for example . 20th Century-Fox has done a pilot based on the movie . Three Coins in the FMMIUM . Of the 1.000 pilot proposals submitted ( three-page outlines to elaborate 100-page presentations ) . only one in 10 will reach the script stage . The first moment of truth comes in May . when the networks took at the scripts. and each selects approximately 30 to be filmed as pilots . The studios and production companies . in the meantime , are deciding to proceed with pilots which they are linancing independently in a gamble to keep all the profits , if any . These are known in trade as " freeballs .

Seven pilots . perhaps , have made it on each of three networks . But even then . for the lucky handful of survivors , the battle is far from over . Network salesmen now have to make the rounds of advertising agencies to line up sponsorship for the new shows , in the face of formidable competition from the established ones . The frenzy now move , to the lobbies and corridors of the agencies . Frc ? quently. a pilot accepted by a network is rejected by the sponsors , who foot the hill once a show gets on the air .

One and Playinnisc 90. whose current brainchild is Batman . " I With it were not necessary to make pilots , " Dozier says , " but I do n't know how to get away from them . It 's basically a sound procedure , like making the prototype of an automobile before putting it on the assembly line . It gives you a chance to recognize and correct your mistakes before you spend millions of dollars in actual production . " There are several case histories to back up Dozier 's contention , The Akfiale 's Nary pilot . for example , was a sea drama , with no comedy .

" Pilots are an evolutionary freak , like the wallaby in Australia , " says Universal production boss Jennings Lang . A handsome , bagel-eating New Yorker . Lang has observed the development of the process since 1952. when he became a television pioneer with the Music Corporation of America . According to Lang . all the early television people came from radio . where shows had been sold on the basis of auditions held for advertisers . Says Lang , " This worked for a while in TV because a lot of radio shows became TV shows , and names like Ozzie and Harriet and Amos ' n ' Andy were familiar enough for advertisers to say ' Go ahead . ' " But with TV 's startling growth came an almost insatiable demand for shows to fill up network time . " This was the opportunity for the movie industry to take over the infant , " Lang observes , " but they chose to ignore it . hoping it would go away . If the big , familiar movie names had moved in then , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , the fringe people , who could n't make a living in films , or who were just starting , were the only who would take a flyer in TV . But the advertisers said to them , ' Who the hell are you , and what have you done ? ' And pilots were born . " At first pilots were fairly reasonable to produce . Up until a few years ago a half-hour show could film its sample segment for as little as $20,000 ; an hour pilot rarely ran over $50,000 . But after ABC made it a three-network race in 1961. the price zoomed up out of all proportion . Today . with an pilots filmed in color  --  and with intense competition for actors , writers and technicians  --  it is almost impossible to make a hall-hour pilot for less than $150,000 or an hour pilot under $400,000 . Costs for an hour show more than double the half-hour figure because pressure to retain the viewer can involve the company in outdoor and even foreign locations , instead of the usual single set . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear little relationship to the shows that may later be seen on the air . Jackie Cooper , the former child star who heads Screen Gems , the lucrative TV arm of Columbia Pictures , recently said , " We 're forced to spend six hundred thousand dollars for a pilot of a show . When it gets on the air , it has a **44;2505;TOOLONG budget . What we 're showing the networks and the advertisers is what would never be a typical episode . " With risk capital seemingly limitless . pilot-making flourishes as an industry within an industry . It even has its own separate standards of pay . An actor who gets $7,500 for doing a segment of a running show can demand and receive as much as $25,000 for doing a pilot . A $2,500 writer earns up to $20,000 for a pilot script , and a ?

He has a contract to direct four CBS pilots a year , at an average fee of $20,0011 . There are two major reasons for these inflated prices .

Actors , particularly , balk at this . and they must he bribed with triple and quadruple fees , sometimes even with a movie commitment .

Similarly , Gunner Pyle was an Andy Griffith spin-off . Meanwhile the pilot graveyards continue to fill up .
