txt The Catholic archdiocese school board was told last night it must raise tuition fees for at least 350 elementary schools by as much as 10 or 15 per cent to avert a financial crisis that could force the closing of many schools . The Rev. H. Robert Clark , archdiocese school superintendent , told the board it must act by March to establish new ceilings for tuition fees or establish an across-the-board charge for each student based on actual costs of operating their schools . Suggest Ceiling Raise Presently , the ceiling on elementary school tuition fees is $100 for each pupil or $150 for families with two or more children attending a school . Father Clark suggested t ha t the board consider raising the ceilings to $110 and $165 . Such an increase , he said , could be implemented over a three-year period beginning with the fall term this year . Father Clark asked the board to consider establishing a new form of tuition fee , a uniform charge for each pupil and substituting it for the traditional system of tuition ceilings . Defends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge , " said Father Clark , " it would put us on firm financial ground . The schools up to now have existed on the sisters ' contribution of their lives . " But with a change in the church , a shift in the services of the sisters , and a decline in their numbers , we can no longer count on them to insure the existence of the schools . A per capita charge would spell out the real costs . " In response to questions from board members , Father Clark acknowledged that any form of a tuition increase could force the archdiocese to close down 50 to 70 inner-city schools . The reason , he said , is that innercity pupils would be unable to meet the increased tuition , and many of them would consequently be forced to leave the schools . " An across-the-board increase , " said Father Clark , " definitely would close them . They are not meeting their costs now , and the children who attend them can barely afford to pay current tuition . " Father Clark asked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases . He said the inner-city schools would require separate study and action by the school board and archdiocese officials . Urge Higher Stipends Board members were told that since 1961 , operating costs of the elementary schools have climbed 120 per cent , while tuition fees have increased 12 per cent . As a consequence , tuition fees which paid GO to 65 also asked the board that , in considering tuition increases , it accept the fact that annual stipends to sisters teaching in the schools also must be raised . Petition is ' Denied The archdiocese currently pays the teaching orders a 51 , - 700 annual stipend for each of their members teaching in parish schools . Father Clark told the board that one order has asked that the annual stipend be raised to $2,400 . In addition to the $1,700 stipend . $120 is paid each year for hospitalization and medical costs . In other business , the board denied a petititon signed by 393 parents of St. George High school students asking that Catholic high school registiation be postponed until all efforts to save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parents ' request was to seek time for them to ask other teaching orders to replace the Christian Brothers as operators of the school . Delaying registration , which is to take place at 86 schools Saturdays , would have permitted boys wishing to enter St. George to wait until the school 's fate was decided before committing themselves to other schools . Cut Teacher Allotment The board also learned that the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary , who provide teachers for 28 elementary schools , have reduced their allocation for the 1969-1970 school year by 24 per cent to 201 teachers .
