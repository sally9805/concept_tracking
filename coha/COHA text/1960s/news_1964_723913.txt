txt President Johnson said today that Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona " will be up there pretty high " when the Republican National Convention votes on a Presidential nominee in July . As for himself , Mr. Johnson said , he intends to " stay out " of the political arena " as long as I can . " Mr. Johnson gave his views at a news conference in his White House office . Question 6 , Page 701 He is trying to keep away from partisanship " and campaigning ' ' ' . in his conduct of the Presidency , Mr. Johnson said , and is restricting his openly political engagements " practically to those " to which President Kennedy had committed himself . The President also said he was trying to acknowledge Republican contributions to " the success of our program . " And the pay rise he has proposed for Federal officials and members of Congress , he said with a smile , will not be " just for Democratic Congressmen . " The news conference was Mr. Johnson 's second this week , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has met the press on every Saturday since March 7 . Today , reporters who entered the White House press office for a routine briefing by George E. Reedy , the President 's press secretary , were escorted through another door , down a corridor and into Mr. Johnson 's office . The President sat in a big swivel chair behind his desk , seeming relaxed and in good humor . " Bill , " he called to Bill D. Moyers , an aide , " you 're the coffee man . Bring the coffee on around here where they can get it . " The actual distribution of the coffee was done by stewards in white jackets , however , they passed among the reporters with trays of white cups bearing the Presidential seal . When the questioning started , Mr. Johnson remained seated while the reporters stood around his desk . Often , he leaned back in his swivel chair and once caught himself just before putting a foot on his desk . What , he was asked , did he think of Senator Goldwater 's claim that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , " Mr. Johnson said , " I do n't keep informed on the details of the Republican aspirants ' gains or losses . " Then he proceeded to display considerable knowledge of Senator Goldwater 's gains and losses . He attributed this knowledge to an unnamed caller with whom he said he had talked yesterday . But Mr. Johnson has expressed much the same view to friends in recent weeks . The visitor had told him , he said , that Senator Goldwater might well carry the California and Texas primaries , as he carried the Illinois primary this week , and put delegates from those states together with the Southern state delegations , and those of such Western states as Arizona , Montana and Wyoming . In that event , Mr. Johnson said , " that potential has some 632 votes . " Senator Goldwater 's minimum prospects , the President said , " looked like a pretty solid figure , over 500 , " the way it is going now . These remarks were reminiscent of some that President Kennedy made in the months before his death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldwater would be the Republican nominee . Observers here believed Mr. Kennedy thought the Senator would be the easiest Republican to defeat and actually was hoping for his nomination . Mr. Johnson 's willingness to boost the Arizona Senator may stem from a somewhat similar feeling . But he insisted that he was not really thinking in political terms these days . " I do n't want to see any party in this country be an opposition party just for the sake of opposition , " he said . " I believe it very damaging to the American nation to have opposition for opposition 's sake and to have blind opposition . " It grieves me when I see measures that are calculated to benefit all Americans opposed along party lines . It distresses me to see measures that came up under President Eisenhower 's Administration that passed with almost solid Republican votes , and the same measures come up with other Administrations and ? they oppose the same measures as opposition votes . " That is not his way , Mr. Johnson said , and continued : " I try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can . I try to keep my political speeches restrained . I have tried , to be the President of all the people .
