txt Weekday mornings used to find Ernie Gregory hard at work here . supervising output of intravenous feeding solutions for Cutter Laboratories , Inc . Cutter officials figure he 's on the job as usual today , though it would take a while to find out for sure . The company 's production lines and some 225 manufacturing jobs , including Mr. Gregory's. have been transplanted to Chattanooga . Tenn . The reason ? High California costs kept Cutter from meeting rivals ' prices and showing a profit , according to Fred Cutter , senior vice president . This businessman 's complaint is heard often around the Golden State these days . An increasing number of manufacturing executives say they 're finding California 's operating costs out of line when compared with those enjoyed by their out-of-state rivals . To meet cor , petition . they claim , they must move plants elsewhere , or  --  more often  --  add production capacity when needed by building in some state other than this one . Many Dissenters State officials and labor leaders , however , strongly maintain that California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state , such as its sizable pool of skilled labor and its big and growing consumer market . And they note that many businesses in California are continuing to expand within the state , while others are moving in . Nevertheless , many California businessmen testify to their troubles with costs : The research team of a major maker of radar equipment developed improved components for military use . But the company repeatedly loses production contracts to Southern competitors whose taxes are lower and whose labor costs are 10 , ; to 30% less . Friden , Inc. , just finished a new business machine factory in Chicago , part of a company policy of making major expansions only outside California , the company 's home state . Bryan Essick , president of Essick Manufacturing Co. , a Los Angeles-based maker of air conditioners , says high tax and labor rates a re prime reasons why his company has " made its last expansion in California . " Essick in recent years has added plants in Wisconsin . New Jersey , Texas and Arkansas . Though President Robert Cannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Californian , " this electronics firm 's newest plants are in Arizona and Massachusetts . The next , says a company report , will be in the Midwest because of California 's " labor rates and taxes . " " And there 's no way to measure how many companies give up the idea of coming here in the first place . " says a State Chamber of Commerce official . Adds Hank Wright of the Los Angeles chamber . " When they drop the idea we have to conclude costs were part of the reason  --  though they never tell us . " The California , Los Angeles and Oakland chambers have launched exhaustive studies aimed at finding facts about comparative production costs . State . Still Grows Not that California . has stopped growing . Population , now nearly 16 million , continues to rise about 1,450 per day . Overall employment averaged 6 million last year . up from 5.2 million in 1955 . Even manufacturing jobs  --  given a healthy boost by the fact that California currently gets 23% of the Federal defense contract dollar  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year . It 's estimated that some 14,500 manufacturing plants have been built or expanded in the state in the past decade , representing capital investment of nearly $4 billion , and new investment In this populous state will no doubt continue to be impressive . But state officials warn that California 's need fOr new jobs far surpasses those of other states . It 's reckoned that 250,000 jobs must be added yearly just to take care of added population . Many businessmen , fretting about soaring costs here , wonder if manufacturing can provide its share . Major causes of their concern include : Expensive worker fringe benefits . Businessmen complain California has the second most liberal  --  and second most expensive  --  workmen 's compensation program of all states ( New York is first ) , costing employers from a few cents to about $20 per $100 of payroll , Sc ' cording to jobs covered . Hospitalization is costly . Mr. Cutter says his Chattanooga employes get the same medical coverage as do the Berkeley workers , but for half the price . Unemployment benefits het @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Employers now pay Into the state unemployment insurance fund an amount equal , on the average , to 1 9,6 of the first $3,600 each worker cams : next January the payment will jump to a maximum of 3 5,1 and apply to a 33,800 base . A political climate which some executives feel is " anti-business . " Some businessmen argue that the governor and the legislature are too pi one to sympathise with demands of or ganized labor , resulting in a steady flow of costly social legislation and restrictions on business . One manufacturers ' group complains that unions backed 184 bills in the last session which , though many failed , did raise some unemployment checks , gave limited collective hat gaining rights to public employes and provided some financial support for workers luring a rett riming period after they are thrown out of work by automation . High chi ect labor costs Average hourly earnings of production workers ( S2 661 are third highest in the nation , flailing only Michigan 162 761 and Washington ( 32,681 The national average is S2 32 hourly , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills California 's 62 6 billion proposed budget and its projected tax collections are the biggest of any statg .

Over the past five years , state and local tax takes have jumped WI , four times the rate of Federal increases Combined state and local tax collections  --  on a per capita basis are higher here than in any other state but New York . An official state government survey says " California tax bills for firms in most industries will tun about 25 's to 30,1 higher than in most Midwestern and Eastern industrial states . " Colored Complaints Such complaints , of course , often have political or economic coloration Frnplovers use them in their bargaining table skirmishes with labor leaders and jousts with liberal poll  --  icians , two groups who want to do things businessmen fear will cost them money . And . in defense of high wage rates here , union leaders cite Federal figures which indicate California has a higher cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poWeal proposals are defended on pounds that new schools are needed to meet population growth , or many elderly people need government aid to get proper medical care The political coloration of many gripes about California 's production costs shows up frequently When a Republican assemblyman said recently that high taxes " will soon bring an e otitis of business out of the state . . . and also deter new industry from moving to California . " he was also getting in his licks at Cloy . Brown 's Democratic fiscal policies . And though businessmen often assert that state administration and legislature are pretty much under labor 's control . considerable evidence indicates otherwise Despite strong labor hacking , a recent bill to restrict use of court injunctions in labor disputes failed to pass , and the slate AFT ... CIO complained that bills to liberalize unemployment and disability insurance fell far short of goals set by labor poops . Among those who dispute the extent of the problem is union economic consultant Harry Polland of San Francisco : he discounts entirely the talk of manufacturers avoiding Califotnin ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement . " he says . " Statistics show there is greater expansion here than in most areas . " State Administration officials apparently share this viewpoint . Concedes California 's director of employment , Irving Perluss : " Business is sensitive to tax burdens . " But , he adds , " I think our taxes are realistic and not exorbitant . They 're needed to provide the services that make California a better stale " Basic Industries to Stay And it 's true , of course . that many of California 's basic industries will stay put . Its giant food processors wo n't leave crop-growing areas , and research-oriented firms will continue to cluster around such cerebral centers as Berkeley and Palo Alto . Thanks to continuing population growth , the important retailing and service businesses will expand . It 's the miscellaneous manufacturers who sell nationally and have business rivals entrenched elsewhere who are getting most skittish about California 's costs .

Into easingly . California executives ate becoming more outspoken on the subject and mot e willing to take action " Politicians do n't seem to realt7e that a tactory can be picked tip and nun ed out , " says one . Some of the moves from Califmnia result from rectuiting activities of low-cost Southern and Midwestet n states which seek industry " I get a steady stream of people ft elm those states in my office . " says one executive , " and they all sing the same soon song of low-cost labor " The song often works One Califin ma company built a factory in Nebraska after hearing about " good , healthy all.Americean boys who will work for $1 50 per hour , " its treasurer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold on a national basis and ca n't compete if we keep all our operations help " F V ' rowing , president of the 500-employe Repeal Brass Manufacturing Co. , says this plumbing fixtures concern moved from Los Angeles to Little Rock after finding that taxes acre two-thirds lower and average hourly rates SI 55 rather than 32.52.
