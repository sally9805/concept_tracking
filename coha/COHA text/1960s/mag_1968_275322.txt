At Ankara 's airport , President Charles de Gaulle 's opening remarks were lost on his hosts-because the official assigned to turn on the public-address system was asleep at the switch . Then De Gaulle noticed that his interpreter had got ahead of him . Nudging the man , De Gaulle growled , " I did not say that . " Finally , the Turkish security police were no match for rampaging photographers , one of whom got his camera within two feet of the general 's nose during the playing of the Marseillaise . <P> The five-day state visit was clearly off to a bad start , even though penitent Turkish authorities promptly sacked the security chief and promised to send the forgetful official to some Turkish equivalent of Siberia .

In private talks , De Gaulle reportedly only echoed his public wish that Turkey " remain her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strategic and economic position " required it to remain an active NATO partner . That , for De Gaulle , was in itself quite a concession .
