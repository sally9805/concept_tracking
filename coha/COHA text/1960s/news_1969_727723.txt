txt ? A consultant to the National ety Bureau has never bothered to called Mustang into the shop to check fol possible steering defect . He says he looked if car over himself and " decided it was n't ilk of the cars they were looking for . " Besidesse says , " I did n't want to lose it for a day or ; To . " Tha* , surPrisinglY , sums up the feelings of an app ? , ently increasing number of American driver : ! They would rather take the chance that the is nothing wrong with their cars than giveup for a day . They are blissfully ig-r norin etroit 's periodic recalls of millions of cars trucks , the latest of which  --  a General Motoirecall of 1.1 million 1965 and 1966 vehiclesras announced this week . They are greeig the whole business with a mighty ho-hum Al as these drivers yawn , the auto makers ? ar their lawyers  --  stir uneasily . Ir here in Detroit , if nowhere else , the recallare viewed as deadly serious business . Al-.tho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peiOntage of the recalled vehicles are actually dertive , they hunt for every possibly faulty cams if it were on the FBI 's 10-most-wanted HE : Why ? " Conscience is part of it , " says an ao company official . But there are other reason . More and more car owners involved in lvidents are claiming their autos were faulty Id are suing the manufacturers , and courts ? increasingly siding with these car owners . i a result , the makers are bending every efet to remove any faults  --  and any liability . n Increase in Suits It is n't known how many suits alleging lefective design or improper building of cars have been filed , but many are pending . Auto companies do n't like to talk about such matters , but Ross Malone , general counsel of GM , said last year that the number of product-liability suits against the company had tripled between 1960 and 1966 . " We have reason to believe that our experience is typical of the automobile industry , " he told a group of insurance executives . Like any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the present surge comes at a time that is especially bad for them . In recent years , the courts have been making it much easier for plaintiffs to collect in product-liability proceedings . Plaintiffs used to have to prove not only that a defect in theicar caused the accident but also that the defect was the result of negligence on the part of the manufacturer . Proving such negligence was enormously costly , time-consuming and difficult . Now , however , most state courts require only that the plaintiff show that the defect caused the accident . Also , more cases now are going to juries , which tend to side with the plaintiffs more often than judges do . Suits against manufacturers can involve hundreds of thousands of dollars , and Mr. Malone says GM pursues an " aggressive defense " in such cases . So far , the manufacturers have won most of the cases , although they have lost some big ones . Some Big Lawsuits GM , for example , . is currently appealing a jury verdict of $460,000 awarded in a case involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design defect that caused a fire after a crash , and the jury agreed . Last year a young man crippled in an accident won a $1 million judgment against Volkswagen on the ground that the 1956 Volkswagen was faultily designed . The judgment was later contested , but the man got an $800,000 out-of-court settlement . Legal liability specialists contend that these and similar court cases are making the auto makers far more diligent about heading off defects in the first place and recalling cars once a defect is spotted . " You are seeing a lot more quality control , more testing in the area of safety and more warnings , " says Harry M. Philo , a Detroit lawyer who has handled several cases against auto makers . Lawyers say the auto makers can use the recall campaigns as a defense in some liability suits . " If the auto companies warn about a defect and nothing Is done about it by the car owner , the companies at least have the defense " that they tried , says Mr. Philo . For this reason , lawyers say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every affected model , even though the Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 requires only that initial owners and those to whom an unexpired warranty has been transferred be notified . The cars and trucks are fixed free of charge , even though the law does n't require it . Ironically , this diligence itself is triggering lawsuits . Recall notices " are a signal to lawyers as to which cars may have a defect , " says Jeffrey O'Connell , a professor of law at the University of Illinois . Some lawyers whose clients have been in accidents are quick to sue the manufacturer if that type of car is later recalled ; they try to use the recall notice as evidence that the car was faulty . Some law firms keep a file of recall notices . But they have difficulty keeping their file complete because the auto makers , never fond of bad publicity , often announce the campaigns in time for the lightly read Saturday morning papers . Auto makers are n't required to announce the recalls publicly . They merely have to notify the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has quietly prodded auto makers to initiate some of the callbacks , can announce defects itself if it thinks the public should know , so the auto makers take no chances and announce the campaigns themselves . Some of the 350 recall campaigns in the past two and a half years have been prompted by Consumers Union , an organization in Mount Vernon , N.Y. , that tests and rates products . It has discovered several defects , and on two occasions it has rated autos " unacceptable " when , it says , the makers refused to recall the models . However , one of the models was recalled about the time the Consumers Union article went to press . All told , more than 12 million cars ' and trucks have been recalled since the Safety Act was enacted in September 1966 . The largest recall occurred just a few weeks ago when General Motors announced it was calling back 4.9 million cars and trucks . GM says the response to its 80 or so recalls has ranged from 70% to more than 95% . Ford says its responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately the percentages have been declining . " People have gone through other campaigns , " says Raymond Flemming , general manager of Lyman Slack Motors , a Chevrolet dealer in Portland , Ore . " The registered letter ( telling of the callback ) is n't anything that motivates them to come running . " " I 've had a devil of a time to get cars in , " says G. M. Sulsar , service manager of Woolston Chevrolet in Paris , Texas . He says that in one recent campaign he finally threatened owners with cancelation of their warranties ? a threat he would be unable to carry out  --  if they did n't bring their cars in . A Chevrolet dealer in Pawtucket , R.I. , adds : " These things are losing their impact as far as any scare is concerned . "
