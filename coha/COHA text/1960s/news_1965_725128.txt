txt specialte The 1 , ew ' York rime . BIENHOA , South Vietnam . Nov. ** battle was over , and the paratroopers of the 173d Airborne Brigade filed slowly back to the tents where they live . It was an ironically beautiful Vietnamese evening , with the rays of a full moon refracted through broken clouds . Pfc . William Henry , 19 years old , of Jackson Heights , Queens , had spent an hour on a barren hilltop Monday , knowing that most of his platoon had pulled out without him . He had sat there , he said later . firing his machine gun , sure he was going to die . But he had not died , and now he and Pfc . Russell Dennis , also 19 , were back at the door of their squad tent , no longer within range of Vietcone , bullets . The first thing they noticed as they drew hack the tent flap and walked inside was that they heard no music and no shouting . They were to discover later , as the bunks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been killed and three seriously wounded . Of the 12 men in the squad , only five slept in their tent last night . By all accounts , the battle had been a famous victory for the Americans , with 403 Vietcong killed . A visitor remarked that this was the kind of fight that United States commanders had been praying for . Private Henry listened , his eyes inexpressibly sad . " It was n't worth it , " he said , twisting his hat in his hands . " Every time I looked up there were bullets dancing up toward me . It was hell . I hated it . I know every guy up there mapped up in a poncho , and it is n't worth it . " " Yeah , " said Private Dennis in the soft accent of the Kentucky bluegrass country . // " You used to have to stand in line to take a shower . Now you can do it any old time you ; want to . " The carnage was not con-I fined to one squad . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vietcong assaults ! had only 15 men of its normal complement of 43 ready for ! duty this morning . The rest ! were dead or wounded . The riflemen , their usual ribald insouciance gone , sat in their bunks and talked of the heroes of the battle . They talked of a staff sergeant who had crawled into the no-man 's land between United States and Communist lines to retrieve dead and wounded buddies . He was hit on his third trip out , and said to the medic who reached him as he was dying : " Tell my grandmother it did n't hurt . " They talked of a specialist 4 who had spent 26 months in the Far East and whose orders for a trip back to the United States were canceled only a week ago because there were not enough replacements . He was dead , too . And they talked of Sgt. 1st Cl . Sylvester Bryant , 32 , of Columbus , Ga. , an amiable , deep voiced man who led a patrol that recovered the bodies of dead Americans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bryant was unhurt and today he stated his code succinctly as he sipped a bourbon and Pepsi-cola from a canteen cup ; " We lead them in there , and we bring them out . " Sergeant Bryant was one of those selected to go to Saigon this afternoon to tell foreign correspondents what had happened to his platoon on Hill 65 . He is a professional soldier , and he managed a kind of grim humor that was beyond the younger men who had fought with him . " We got into position when they opened fire , " he said , " and when I say we got into position I mean we got on to the ground . " That V. C. unit we fought ' could have held its roll call in a phone booth this morning . " ' I 've Tried ' Staff Sgt. John T. White of Jamaica , Queens , an intense and articulate squad leader who had lived through the worst of the battle , spent most of last night in the company orderly room , talking to anyone who would listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been almost wiped out . " I 've done the very best I could , " he said . " I have n't shirked . I 've tried to make my commander proud of me and my squad . " Now all I want to do is get out of here , get away from this place , go home . But I ca n't take my men with me because they 're most of them ' dead . " You ca n't make friends in times like this ; all you can have is associates . " At the crude little officers ' club , the leaders of the unit that had fought the battle ? the First Battalion , 503d Infantry  --  sat around a circular table and drank a great deal of beer . They talked with almost too much sang-froid of the men who had died . It was as if they were afraid to begin to express their emotions for fear they would be unable to stop . Second Lieut . Robert M. Gregson of Pasco , Wash. , had lost two of his best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been roommates at West Point , and they had been the first members of the class of 1964 sent to Vietnam . ? One officer had said to his company commander just before beginning an attack : " This looks like a nice place to die . " He was killed by a machinegun bullet between the eyes five minutes later . ' We 're Doing a Job ' Lieutenant Gregson had been hit behind the right ear and in the left thigh by mortar shell fragments . He said he felt no emotion at all . " We 're doing a job , " the 23-year-old lieutenant said . " Saying that is the only way I can deal with this . Both of them were leading rifle platoons in the attack and that 's what we 're supposed to do . " The battalion commander , Lieut . Col. John E. Tyler of Winona . Miss. , slumped in his chair as he talked about the dead officers . He wore two clays ' growth of heard and a filthy fatigue.uniform . " If anybody should have to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rifle company platoon leaders . Their life expectancy on the assault is about 12 seconds . " Then he turned to the other officers at the table . " No reveille tomorrow , " he said .
