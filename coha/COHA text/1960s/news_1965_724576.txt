Powell 's charge tha Mrs. James was a " bag woman " , made two years , ago , first on the House floor and then on television , that led to the defamation c of character suit that has involved the Harlem Representative ever since .

Mr. Powell delivered his speech from a loose-leaf notebook on a music-stand lectern on the House floor , gesturing to the members and the galleries with his black-framed glasses . 50 Members Present There were about 50 Representatives present , three-quarters of them Democrats . This was an unusually large number for the late afternoon period . In his litany of grievances , Mr. Powell inveighed against the press in general , The New York Times in particular , allegedly corrupt policemen in Harlem and " political judges .

Mr. Powell declined to repeat off the floor the names of those he called killers , his charges against the police or further characterization of Mrs. James . The Representative said he was making the speech because " certain biased press have misinformed the public " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public might know the truth . " He called The Times " the unfriendliest newspaper in the country to me " and said the paper 's editors , while criticizing his advocacy of free expression , " were doing everything they could to evade a $500,000 libel suit in Alabama " in which The Times ' defense had been based on free expression . Plans Harlem ' Expos ? ' Mr. Powell said he would begin exposing conditions in Harlem in a series of speeches next week . As an off-hand example , he charged that New York City policemen were receiving $3,000 a month in payoffs for each " drop , " or temporary repository , for narcotics he said " they protected in Harlem . Tracing his complicated case through the courts , Mr. Powell maintained that a contempt citation and a warrant for his arrest had been " unlawfully issued , " and that one court proceeding against him had no jurisdiction because the papers were served at a wrong address . " I 've been tried three times in New York City by all-white juries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to invoke the Civil Rights Act to protect Myself in New York City . " This brought a smile from Speaker John McCormack and laughter from some of the other Democrats . " I intend to continue to fight , and I will not be deterred by this irrelevant suit , " he cried . He reserved his severest criticism for the police , charging that " narcotics-pushers ' rave all the protection they want from the Police Department . " ' Dregs ' of the Force " The vast majority of the police in my town are fine , upright men , " Mr , Powell said , " but in Harlem , we get the dregs of the police force . " When the Representative finished , about half the Democrats present applauded , and Representative Roman C. Pucinski of Illinois gave him a one-man standing ovation . More than 50 different judges sitting in eight courts have heard aspects of the defamation suit during the , more than 22 months of litigation . Legal observers of the case disputed Mr. Powell 's contention that at no time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress could not be prosecuted for statements made off the floor of the House if the had previously been made in Congress . The New York State Supreme Court jury that found him guilty of defamation on April 4 , 1963 , specifically considered , under the charge given them by the judge , whether the statements about Mrs. James were true and ; whether Mr. Powell was protected by Congressional immunity when he made them on a 1960 television interview program .
