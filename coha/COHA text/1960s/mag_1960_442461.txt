are three graves in a row marked by simple , identical stones set equidistantly , and flat , in the greensward . Each has the briefest of inscriptions . At the right lies Edwin J. Lewis , 1848-1926 ; at the left , Emma Kermott Lewis , 1848-1891 ; and between them one of their three sons , Sinclair Lewis , 1885-1951 , " Author of Main Street . " The world-renowned writer holds the honored place between his parents . But the mother , who died when he was six after a long illness with tuberculosis spent in sanatoriums far from home , he barely knew , and he was not his father 's favorite son . Behind them is the Lewis monument marking the family lot , lugubrious , of dark granite , underneath the mournful draperies of the stone .

There seems to be no existing photograph of him after early childhood . I have one taken at the age of three or four , before the characteristic features had developed . There are apparently none taken subsequently until after he left Yale . ? Governor Orville Freeman proclaimed 1960 as Sinclair Lewis Year in Minnesota . The first weekends in July , August , and September were given over to a Lewis festival . Nineteen sixty would have been the year of his seventy-fifth birthday , and is the fortieth anniversary of the publication of Main Street , the thirtieth of his winning the Nobel Prize . LAD never before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was married to Sinclair Lewis , he had never urged me to visit the town or proposed taking me . His father and stepmother were dead before we met ; only his older brother Fred and Fred 's family had never left Sauk Centre , and to them Sinclair Lewis was indifferent ; and I do not believe that he visited the town himself during our marriage , except en route to somewhere else . What drew me there now , to attend this festival in his honor ? Some desire to pay tribute to him as an artist ? Some appeal to a humorous sense of curiosity about how the satirizer of all boosters might now be celebrated by the same ? Specifically so that his two only grandsons , John Paul Sinclair Lewis , aged six , and Gregory Claude , aged three , sons of Michael Lewis , Sinclair 's only surviving son , might visit the childhood haunts of the grandfather who died before they were born ? Or was there not another reason , wholly unconscious , when I made the decision to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be broiling weather ? Was it not a desire to learn , if I could , more about the man who for a few years had been the center of my existence , had fathered my only child , had caused me more grief than joy , but whom , after more than twenty years of total separation , I could never put out of my mind ? My daughter-in-law Bernadette , her three-year-old son Gregory , and I ( John Paul had come down with measles in Chicago and had been left in Minneapolis with his nurse ) now stood before the three stones . Why , I wondered , had the writer wished to be buried in Sauk Centre beside his father ? His brother , Dr. Claude B. Lewis of nearby St. Cloud , had expressed surprise at the news and concluded , " He must have loved the old town . " But was that the reason ? The questions that flashed through my mind at the grave were to be pondered all the while I was in Sauk Centre , and afterward . Sauk Centre had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success , and the legendary " Zenith , " an up-and-coming city of the same Middle West , was the scene of two later superior and successful novels , Babbitt and Dads-worth . The geriesis of his literary insights was here and in this vicinity . It was artistically fitting that his ashes should finally rest here . But why , as he expressly commanded , next to those of his father ? The body of his stepmother , Isabel Warner Lewis , is interred in the family lot , but not next to the husband she loved and served so long , nor next to the famous son , whom she understood and protected more than the father , cver did . There was a certain filial piety in Sinclair Lewis . During his father 's lifetime he wrote home regularly . But although he begot two sons , he had no father-son relationship with either of them . Continually separated from both children , he seldom wrote to either , and when living in the same house with one or boils of them , wished to see then'i only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his best behavior . He was not affectionate with them . Both children ? 1 had occasion to see much of his older son , Wells , in our home , and eventually in my own , from the time he was eleven until he went away to war never to return again ? were afraid of him . If he bantered with them , it was with an irony too far over their young heads to grasp , and it humiliated them . Wells , sophisticated and humorous , once he got away from his father and was mature , affected and doubtless really felt considerable affection for " the old bastard . " When , at twenty-one , Wells published his first and , for his age , distinctly promising novel , They Still Say No , his father , who had read the manuscript and picked the title , was excited and proud . Michael , when he passed babyhood , had toward his father a resentment and fear that he never overcame . At seven he remarked , after a reverie , " When I grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At thirteen , lie said solemnly , " All my life I have felt like a bastard . " When he was invited by his father to join him , before and after our final separation and divorce , he looked forward to the event with a combination of hope and anxiety . When a schoolmate asked him about his famous father he replied morosely , " I hardly know the man . " On a very few occasions , his father had invited him to visit , but always arranged some activity for Michael that would remove the boy from his presence and even from his house ? a fishing trip with someone else , or a motor tour . Their last encounter had been catastrophic . Michael was twenty and completing his work at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London , when his father invited him to spend the Christmas holidays with him in Rome . Sinclair Lewis was then very ill . Rumors had reached inc from friends and acquaintances who had seen him that his poor head was as emaciated as a skeleton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The father had invited the son to lunch with him promptly at one the day after his arrival . Michael had spent the night on the town , getting to bed in the hotel where his father had sent him ? was there no room in the large apartment ? ? at dawn . He overslept and was very late for lunch . His father , in a fury of rage , demanded that he return immediately to London and , in effect , said , " Never darken my door again . " Michael returned to London , took his diploma , and then came home only a day or two before his father died and only some two weeks after he had taken his wretched , humiliating , though not undeserved , dismissal . Sinclair Lewis had received the news of his older son 's death in the fall of 1944 in a manner that seemed utterly feelingless . He was on a lecture tour en route to Chicago when the news came over the radio that Lieutenant Wells Lewis had been shot in Alsace by a sniper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom he was aide-de-camp . My gentle , sensitive sister , who was devoted to Sinclair Lewis and to Wells and of whom Lewis was fond , felt that the news which he might not have heard should be broken to him lovingly and went to the railroad station but missed him . He had scheduled a party for the evening , to which my sister and her husband had been invited . They phoned the Palmer House , where he was staying , thinking it might have been called off . Lewis had already left for the party , and they went . There they found him in the liveliest possible mood . No one mentioned the death of Wells , but my brother-in-law , finding himself , for a moment , apart with " Red , " quietly and simply expressed his sympathy and sorrow . Sinclair Lewis flew into a biting rage . " People just love to be bearers of bad news . " He snarled at Hal ( Harrison ) Smith , who had telephoned or telegraphed his friendship and sympathy . He attacked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wells 's death a few min-utes before I was scheduled to leave for it . " Dorothy 's just putting on an act . She was n't his mother . It 's all self-dramatization . " Fanny Butcher , longtime literary critic of the Chicago Tribune , was there , and Lloyd Lewis , the newspaperman and historical writer , with his wife . Sinclair Lewis admired Lloyd and had collaborated with him on the play jayhawker , which had not been a success . When I ran into Fanny some months later , she was still shocked at Lewis ' conduct that evening . Lewis bragged that he had heard the news just before he went to lecture and had never " been better in my life . " My sister , defending Hal Smith , said , " He is one of your oldest friends . He did n't want to bear bad news , but to offer you sympathy and comfort . And you know that what you say about Dorothy is not true . She loved Wells deeply , and he loved her . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But my sister was not shocked . She was sorry . She knew only too well that Lewis ' reaction to frustrations and griefs was to hit out at those who cared most for him , and often at those for whom he cared most . That was always the trouble : never knowing whether he really cared at all , for anybody or anything except his work . Neither was I shocked when I heard the story some time later . I commented only that he must have felt perfectly dreadful . He repressed his emotions to a point unbearable for those who wished to share them and had the pride of Lucifer in doing so . But how many great writers have ever been good family men ? In recalling biographies , one finds that their number is minuscule . S/NCLAIR Lewis was not a good father . When young he had been a docile , dutiful son of a father who had inspired admiration , often fear , but never , I had gat'lered , intimacy or warmth of feeling . So it could hardly be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be buried here , I pondered . After his father 's death he had maintained fairly close ties with only one member of the family , his brother Claude . Theirs was a real friendship that lasted until Sinclair Lewis ' death and extended even to Claude 's family , with whom he was more at ease than with his own . Claude and his family had visited us several times in New York and in Vermont . The two brothers looked very much alike , except that " Harry " ( as Claude continued to call him ) was much taller than Claude . I never heard Sinclair Lewis consistently express as much admiration for any other man as he did for Claude . Nearly six years younger than Claude , Harry had in his boyhood perpetually tagged after his brother and was proud of him as a physician , a surgeon , and a man . Claude had the mind of a scientist , and the author , in keeping with his times , elevated the scientific mind above all others . Claude was not a country doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had received his medical training at Rush Medical College in Chicago , a highly reputed school which since 1942 has been incorporated in the University of Chicago , and like his father he chose northern Minnesota for his home and work . But he had lived and practiced in St. Cloud , a town ten times as large as Sauk Centre , comely , prosperous , the scat of the Minnesota State Teachers College and of a splendid Catholic hospital of whose staff he was a member . He had studied internal medicine , was an excellent diagnostician and a skillful surgeon . He had exuberant health . His habits were temperate as to food , drink , and sleep ; he loved the outdoors of the northern woods , lakes , and streams , was a first-rate shot and an exceptionally skillful fisherman . And , as laconic in speech as his writer brother was garrulous , he was the very soul of ineffusive kindness . Sinclair Lewis once remarked to me , " The only people I ever wanted to impress were my father and brother Claude . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , who had died before I met his genius son . But impressed or not impressed , Claude had a deep affection and highly protective feeling for his brother . Claude was not , by nature , a reformer ( nor , except in his younger days , was his writer brother ) . He accepted people as they were , when they were beyond the powers of medicine to heal . Sinclair Lewis thought psychiatry a form of quackery . Claude was conscious of its limited power to cure unhappy personalities . But he had respect for modern psychological analysis . " Harry had a huge inferiority complex , " he once remarked . " Had it as a kid . " " Ass meinen glosses Schmerzen mach ' ich die kleine Lieder , " wrote Heine , who made most of his own Schmerzen for himself . Claude probably comprehended this generality . But he was a doctor and was outraged by his brother 's way of life . When I telephoned him upon receiving the news of Sinclair Lewis ' death , he answered in his clipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise me a bit . Lewiscs are long-lived . He was basically healthy . Should have lived another ten years at least . But could n't , the way he behaved . Drink 's affected his central nervous system . But why did n't that secretary telephone me ? If I 'd known of his condition , I 'd have taken the next plane to Rome . Wonder who was taking care of him . " ( He meant what doctor , with a strong implication of doubt about Italian medicine . ) Pitiable as he was , Sinclair Lewis could not endure or give pity . Nor was Claude a dispenser of it . Perhaps the only person in the world whom Sinclair Lewis would have welcomed then would have been Claude ? gruff , unsentimental , and competent . But Claude , who lived to be seventy-eight , is not buried in Sauk Centre . Sinclair Lewis ' ashes are not beside those of his most enduring friend in the family . Pauses he wanted , I thought , to rest here from a sense of tradition , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary mores had , like his fellow iconoclast H. L. Mencken , a deep feeling for tradition . If , like Mencken , he had little use for the commercial middle classes ( the booboisie ) , and especially their promoters , boosters , retailers , salesmen , and ad men , it was not because of a keen social consciousness about the exploited workers or the oppressed minorities . He admired the independent entrepreneur industrialist ( Dodsworth ) , and hated the corporation empires ; he felt sorry for the dirt farmers , " Svenska " ( Scandinavian ) and " Dutch " ( German ) , so many of whom were his father 's patients in his boyhood and whom he saw being squeezed by land dealers , loan sharks , middlemen , and later by bureaucratic policies and regulations . He did not think highly of Jews , in general , because of their predominant economic activities , though he admired Jewish scientists , doctors , and a few writers . ( Gottlieb , in Arrowsmith , is surely one of his most sympathetic creations . ) He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of the law , and politicians , almost without exception , rogues , promising all things to all men , with the single aim of being elected . He was basically apolitical , but insofar as his social ideas were articulate and consistent , he was an old-fashioned populist American radical . He attempted over a number of years to write a novel about labor , studied the scene with his usual thoroughness , had long talks with many labor leaders , and finally threw the manuscript away with the dictum that few labor leaders were really concerned with helping the rank and file ; rather , they were concerned with feathering their own nests and grabbing power . I went with loins to an AFL convention in Canada , and he ' railed at its leaders all the way back . Toward American Negroes he had a genuinely warm feeling , and in then . a real interest . He left part of his estate to the NAACP and the Urban League . But his interest was more seignorial than egalitarian . He was more against the white South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south ? purest Anglo-Saxon stock in America ? are awful : filthy , inbred , shiftless . " I remembered the remark when Kingsblood Royal was published . His yearnings , if not his tastes as expressed in his way of living , were more aristocratic than democratic . He hankered after the old and long established . He fled to Europe as a cure for all his woes , and always , by preference , to England , France , and Italy , with then ? long continuity of culture . He disliked urban Germany , even before Hitler , because of its energy , technology , inodernism , and Babbittry . His attraction was to the medieval ; he was as versed as an art historian in twelfth , thirteenth , and fourteenth century cathedrals , churches , abbeys , and castles ; although , to the end of his life , as far as I know , he was indifferent to pictures and sculpture except as part of architecture . Those that adorned his walls were usually prints , and all conventional . He discovered music only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intensity with which he did everything . He left an enormous collection of records , all of them of classical music . Ir TRADITION influenced his desire to be interred beside his father in Sauk Centre , it was not because of the civilized traditions embodied there . When he was born , as I learned there last summer , Sauk Centre had only recently emerged as a settled village . The first white child to be born there had preceded Sinclair Lewis by less than twenty-five years . The Indians , because of the lakes , had been fishermen and loggers , and logging first attracted the small number of white settlers , who lived in stockades . The loggers cut down the trees , so that the earliest picture of Sauk Centre is of a village bleak and treeless . Yet it must earlier have been heavily wooded . Oak , elm , birch , and poplar flourish there , and today its heavily shaded streets , neat lawns , the Sauk Lake , and the incomparable skies are its only claim to beauty . Its buildings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England towns and villages that rank among the loveliest in the Western world . Many of the Sauk Centre homes of Lewis ' boyhood , as well as his father 's , still stand . They arc comfortable , reasonably spacious , gabled , replete with screened porches front and back , but lacking in any architectural design whatsoever . By the time Sauk Centre came into being , the great fireplaces of the earlier-settled East had given way to more practical stoves and hot-air furnaces , burning wood or coal . There is nothing there one would wish to restore . The physical description of Gopher Prairie , as seen through the eyes of Carol Kennicott in Main Street , is not very different to this day . Of course , there are new buildings and new homes , mostly of the ranch type , some of them of attractive design , but few are in the village proper . One recalls Carol 's dream of having it all rebuilt in Georgian brick with shuttered windows and white trim and her efforts to get the only possible village Maecenas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carol never did anything about even smaller dreams . Except for refurnishing her husband 's home , which is recognizably the old E. J. Lewis place , Carol was a great improver only in her own mind . The novelist 's stepmother , Isabel Warner Lewis , did do something . Like Carol , who in the novel had been a librarian in St. Paul , she was relatively urban . Dr. E. J. Lewis brought her as his second wife from Wilmette , a suburb of Chicago . She was a leader in the Gradatim Ladies Club ( in the novel , the Thanatopsis ) and among the few movers to create the City Park , which adds greatly to the town . She was also a mover in providing the first village rest room for the wives of the German and Swedish farmers from the surrounding countryside , who brought their wives into town along with their products , the wives to do the week 's shopping with nowhere to wash , relax , and be sheltered from the village heat or cold . She was an early clubwoman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Will Kennicott 's widowed mother , who had given over her Gopher Prairie home to the bridal pair and lived elsewhere , but nearby . She has little role in the story , but is sympathetically depicted . The history of the Lewis family , on both sides , was pioneer . Of British stock , the paternal family was ? if the legend is true , and in Sauk Centre I sass ' it stated with fair evidence in the family Bible ? descended from Peregrine White , the first child born to the Mayflower Pilgrims in America . The Lewises were American a hundred and fifty years before there was a United States . The mother 's origins were more obscure . The novelist had told me that the family was " French Canuck , " but this , I found from the family annals in the possession of his brother Fred 's widow , is not true . The Kermotts came from the Isle of Wight , and the family reached America through a fourteen-year-old boy who apprenticed himself to a ship 's captain , trading between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lad , having had a row with the captain , jumped the ship , and thereafter he and the family he founded remained in British Canada . There is a rumor that the name was not Kermott , but that this name was adopted later , probably by the boy , who jumped the ship and wished to conceal his identity . Emma Kermott 's father ? none of the family still living in Sauk Centre seems to know when or how ? came to the United States and became , or already was , a veterinarian . E. J. Lewis married Emma in 1873 . He was then living in and beginning his medical practice in Ironton , Wisconsin , where she was teaching school . Apparently the ancestral Lewises moved very early from Massachusetts to Connecticut and farmed in the vicinity of Westville . Then , during the Gold Rush of the 1840s , the family sold the farm , pulled up stakes , and went to California . Like many thousands of others , they found no gold and started working their way eastward , getting as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Lebanon . From Lebanon , the family moved to Elysian , Minnesota , tracking westward again . E. J. Lewis , after a spell of teaching school in Redwood Falls , Minnesota , went to Rush Medical College in Chicago . He practiced first in Ironton , Wisconsin , where both his oldest son , Fred , and the second son , Claude , were born . The third son , Harry Sinclair Lewis , ten years younger than the oldest , was the first Lewis to be born in Sauk Centre . The New England tradition persisted in the family 's religion . Unlike the Lutheran Scandinavians who , with predominantly Catholic Germans , settled the farms surrounding Sauk Centre , the Lewises were Congregationalists , whose church descends from the Puritans . The well-to-do Protestant Anglo-SaxonS in Sauk Centre built and attended the Episcopal Church . The present church existed in Sinclair Lewis ' childhood , Designed by Cass Gilbert and built of stone in the Tudor style , covered with ivy and well placed in pleasantly landscaped grounds , it was and is the most distinguished building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneer territory and their outlying farms were greatly in need of physicians . The Sauk Centre of 1920 , when Main Street was published , had a population of 3000 . It has some 3500 today . In Sinclair Lewis ' childhood it was , I heard , under 2000 . Yet Dr. E. J. Lewis prospered , and although the family did not rank in the top economic class along with the banker , the commission merchant , and those who had made substantial fortunes in real-estate deals , it was economically not so far from the top . Dr. E. J. Lewis could afford to send both younger sons penuriously to college ? Fred , the oldest , never cared about a higher education ? and although , among the gilded youth of Yale ; a rich man 's college , Harry Lewis was too poor , and too eccentric , to belong to the upper crustand too proud to join its outcasts , he never had to tend furnaces or otherwise work his way through : He did do some newspaper work for pittances . When the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mostly in farm mortgages . That was a great deal more then than it is now , and considerable for a country doctor to amass . So , perhaps for social reasons , the Lewis family might have joined the Episcopal Church . Certainly never the Methodist or Baptist , with at that time their hell-fire revivalism which Sinclair Lewis the writer was so bitingly to satirize . But , except for Sinclair Lewis ' adolescent conversion ( while preparing for Yale in Oberlin and from which he soon recovered ) , there is no indication of any particular religious feeling in the Lewis family , father or sons , beyond the purely formal . The father thought the church a good thing for the community , and the family regularly attended morning service together , sinless the father were on an emergency call , and the boys also attended Sunday School . The father believed in and practiced the sterner and more puritanical virtues , pre-eminent among them duty , and especially the duties of his healing profession .

The father fulfilled his duties to his patients , his family , and the community . He did not attempt to collect fees from those who were indigent through no fault of their own , from the widow with children whom she could barely feed or clothe , or from the struggling farmer whose crops and year 's work had been destroyed by drought . His ledgers , preserved by Fred 's family , which I saw in Sauk Centre in his widow 's home , carry laconic comments ? " Ca n't pay . " But he had neither charity nor patience for " ne'er-do-wells , " who shifted off onto others responsibilities which , by hard work , they would have been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the margins the words " Dead beat , " or " No good . " One remarks , " Skipped the country with a niece leaving a wife and four children . S.O.B . " How many characteristics of his father the author son displayed ! Sinclair Lewis had the same sense of duty toward his work , though it was often interrupted by breakdowns . And how often did I hear him cry , " I 'm so tired , so tired ! " He never drank while he was actually working , but spent regular uninterrupted hours at his writing table . When he had come to a stalemate in a novel , he would go on a drinking bout , leaving home with a secretary or any companion he might pick up , disappearing for days or weeks ; and such a breakdown invariably occurred , during my life with him , at the end of every novel and lasted until another idea for a novel miraculously was born in his fevered mind . His work was always ordered . Ile wrote his novels from precise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their haunts , building the structure of the book as an architect designs a house . Characters and incidents developed as he Wrote , but they moved within the framework . With the tools of his work he was as scrupulous as his father was with his surgical instruments . Sharpened pencils , notebooks , paper , carbon were always in the same place . His writing table was never littered , and what he had written was neatly stacked each clay . In his home he demanded an orderliness that sometimes drove me to exasperation . Ile smoked continuously but could not endure a half-tilled ash tray . But he also could not endure an ash tray , or anything else , that seas not exactly Where it should be , nor a meal that was not served punctually to a second . He always hung his clothes on exactly the proper hangers , and his bureau drawers might have been kept by the best-trained valet . He was scrupulous about paying bills and collecting debts , and , like his father , had no use for dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might cultivate them briefly out of a writer 's curiosity . He was hell on servants , thinking nothing of their hours or recreations ? yet they were invariably devoted to him . But he would fire them out of hand for even a slightly unsatisfactory performance of a task , for any familiarity , or for what he might consider an overreaching of a long tacitly granted privilege . Are such characteristics the result of early environment , even though one rebels against it , or are they congenital ? At any rate , " Like father , like son " was not suspended in the Lewis case . Perhaps the dust did call to dust . BUT was it not all muds simpler ? Where else could he have been buried ? Where else had he ever had a home ? Where had he spent anything like the seventeen years of his life that he had lived in Sauk Centre before he went away to college ? He had had many homes , but never , until his marriage to me , owned one with the intention ofkeeping it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twin Farms , in Barnard , Vermont . We spent only long summers here ( where I ant writing this ) , and although he was often away , it was his home for eight years , and during that time he was certainly happier and more creative here than he was anywhere else . And this home was also his simplest . In 1933 he bought a large Tudor-style house in Bronxville , New York , as a wedding anniversary present to me . I did not want him to do it . I could not imagine him , or myself , happy in the suburbs . Thereafter , following our separation and eventual divorce , he rented and furnished an enormous New York penthouse , with a living room sixty feet long and views from its windows of every bridge in New York ? the specifications he had given to a real-estate agent . Apart from his books , which lined the great room from floor to ceiling , it was as conventionally furnished as if designed by an expensive but not at all imaginative interior decorator . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought a house in Duluth , having decided to return to Minnesota . Again , the house was immense , pretentious , and ugly , a German-style Mid-Victorian castle , looming in the most prominent position in the city ? a white elephant , Duluth people said , with a bowling alley and billiard table in the recreation room in the basement . He wrote Cass Timber/arm and discovered that he was tired of , Duluth , traveled again , and bought a large estate near Williamstown , Massachusetts , again in New England . Here the land and view were beautiful , but the large house was nondescript and conventional , such as might have been built for a prosperous executive . That , which held all his household possessions , including his books , and was kept by a caretaker , was in his ownership when he died . Both these houses were sold to Catholic orders , ironic for an owner who had despised all organized religions .

He had never been rooted anywhere , except in his childhood and youth in Sauk Centre . Nor had he made many real or permanent Friends . In England he had had a few friends who were more than admirers of his work . But most of them had predeceased him . Or the European continent he made few , if any , close friends , even among writers , although initially he was much sought after , because his work had been translated into every European language and was a best seller in many countries . So gregarious that he could not bear to be alone except while at work , he sought temporary companions rather than friends . He was never in the least Europeanized . Although he had spoken German from boyhood , picking up a " schoenste Langewitch " version from the German-speaking people of Minnesota , and had studied it in high school , aided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and could write , it correctly , even literately , his accent was bad , and speaking it torrentially , he forgot grammar . His French was limited and abominable . He had many times started studying Italian systematically , but how well he eventually came to speak and write it , I do not know . His erudition in English and American literature was phenomenal , but with Continental literature he was only superficially familiar . Of the works of Flaubert he spoke only , during our life together , of Madame Boomy . He had certainly read Balzac but never in my remembrance returned to him , as he repeatedly did to Dickens . When , after our marriage , we started together to collect a library , the German and Russian classics were added by me . On the Continent he drifted toward Americans : journalists , foreign service people , or Europeans with American wives . He was as American as ham and eggs and strawberry shortcake , and always distinguishably so . Although he had written Babbitt in England and Rome and most of Dodsworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him anywhere in Europe . In Rome , he died alone , and only his secretary ? a strange man of undistinguishable nationality , whom he had engaged in Florence ? accompanied his poor body to the crematorium , though his death was front-page news in every American and European newspaper . No one , as far as I could learn from the secretary , when I saw him in Rome a year or so later , visited him in the hospital to which he had been delivered delirious in a state of total physical and nervous collapse . He emerged only briefly from the coma in which he soon died , and his last words at the hospital are said to have been , " God bless you , Sister , " to the attendant nun . Now , standing before his grave , I saw him , as when I met him for the first time in the foreign office in Berlin , July 8 , 1927 . " Knick " ( H. R.

He seemed to bring in with him a disturbing atmospheric tension such as that which precedes an electric storm . I saw a narrow , ravaged face , roughened , red , and scarred by repeated radium and electric needle burnings , less of the face below the hawkish nose than above it , where it broadened into a massive frontal skull , crossed by horizontal lines ; reddish but almost colorless eyebrows above round , cavernously set , remarkably brilliant eyes , transparent as aquamarines and in them a strange , shy , imploring look ; red-blond hair , already retreating , very fine and silky ; a small and narrow mouth , almost lipless , drawn away from the long teeth by repeated burnings , and which in the course of a few minutes could smile a dozen ways . The face of a man who had walked through flame throwers . An elegance about the figure , slim , narrow , long boned , very tall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have forgotten where to stop ; long and narrow hands and feet . Very well dressed in clothes obviously from Savile Row . And an immediate aura of greatness , large , torrential , tortured , and palpitatingly sensitive . I felt that if one but touched him with the softest finger tip , he would recoil . My instantaneous reaction seas , God , what a lonely , unhappy , helpless man ! Somebody mast love and take care of him ! And , of course , I was fascinated . I did not imagine myself in the role . I did not fall in love with hint then , nor really , ever . It was something deeper than that which can happen so many times in anyone 's life . I married hint a year later in London after a courtship pursued in Berlin , Vienna , Russia , and Italy . What moved me was a compelling sense of his need . Yet neither I nor any other woman who had come into his life before or was to come afterward could fill whatever that need might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , driving and driven , yearning and resistant . In the end all women left him , driven away perhaps by the impossibility of penetrating the curtain that screened him from any real intimacy ; or he left them , forever disappointed . I remember other things , of course : the incandescence of his conversation , more often than not a monologue ; his hilarious gift for mimicry , usually of his own characters or those being created in his ? mind ; and his continuation of a monologue until the listeners were exhausted or bored ; his incredible power to ad-lib verse in the manner of any English-writing poet from Shakespeare to Vachel Lindsay or T. S. Eliot , as fast as he could talk , with never a fault of meter or of style ; the game we played together and with others , of which of us THE BOY AND MAN FROM SAUK CENTRE could most quickly compose a sonnet containing a line usually meaningless ? he always won , doing it as fast as he could write . His mind was as swift as light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his fishing words out of never-never land . Challenged , they were always in the dictionary . His intimates remember his flaring and often cruel temper , at any slight , real or imagined , during which his nostrils would expand like those of a horse , and his unspoken contrition afterward , expressed in introverted sulkiness . They remember the penetrating acidity of his remarks on public figures and on everything that he considered puffed up and overblown . Yet he was himself , as a man and writer , overblown . And one remembers , also , his generous encouragement to other writers , especially young ones , and his ineffable charm . But he was really happy only in his work . When it was going well , he would often chuckle at his typewriter and tear out a page to read to me . He took special delight , it scented , in his more monstrous and ridiculous characters . He ' wrote most of It Ca n't Happen Here in Vermont , and excerpts from the speeches of the preposterous Berzilius Windrip , which head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , with gusty relish , with the happy comment , " What a bastard ! " If the child is father to the man , what kind of lad was Harry Lewis in Sauk Centre ? There are still many people there who remember him , a few who went to school with him , and I saw a number of them . Their picture is of a lonely boy , eager to be one of the gang ( one of the Club , of which his brother Claude was the mischievous ringleader ) but forever repulsed . In a small town , then as now , physical skills are highly admired by other boys and their elders . they fish , hunt , build secret refuges for themselves in the woods , retrieve and patch up discarded wagons and machinery , and earn money by picking berries , mowing lawns , and doing small handyman jobs for the neighbors . Harry was good at none of these things . He was too nervous and impatient to be a good fisherman , hacl no pride in killing rabbits and game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singularly helpless at anything requiring the concentration and control of his hands or limbs . With his long legs and natural swiftness of movement , he should have been proficient at sonic games . Theoretically he liked tennis , but although for a time we had the only tennis court in our Vermont township , he rarely appeared on it and was as bad a shot with a ball as with a bullet . His mechanical competence extended to the ability to change a typewriter ribbon , and stopped there . His exercise was walking , and he walked untiringly until , in his trampings , he had explored anarea . Then he was bored with the paths through the woods , ever-changing as they always are . He was not interested in the minutiae of nature . He preferred to walk in Europe , where every village and county is different ? in Cornwall from Land 's End to Tintagel ; clean across Shropshire ; along the Main from Mainz to Frankfurt ; from Innsbruck through the Alps to Venice . These tours took with hint . He never would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that appeared when we were tired . His knapsack was always heavy with books . If , at rest in the evenings , he could not read , he was frantic . He enjoyed conversation only with a group , though he would stop to talk with wayfarers about their lives and occupations , or linger in cemeteries , fascinated by names on tombstones and noting some in a book . Everyone with whom I talked in Sauk Centre who had known him as a boy remarked that he always had his nose in a book ; one recalled him reading on the Lewis lawn with the lawn mower nearby and only a few roses cut . I tried to find out from his contemporaries what he had read and got the impression that it was mostly romantic novels ( Scott was repeatedly mentioned ) and a great deal of poetry . Later , when a successful writer , he professed to despise poetry ? " People write poetry who ca n't write prose " ? and his insistence on this was once the cause of a heated quarrel between us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had started his literary career with writing poetry ? better described as verse ? and his knowledge and memory of the English and American poets were prodigious . He had a photographic memory of any printed page . A Harvard don , English teacher , and poet who was once visiting us started to quote from a poem by John Donne . We were sitting before the fire in the big room at Twin Farms , and Lewis had rudely retired behind a newspaper . Our guest halted in his recitation , groping for the next lines . Sinclair Lewis put down his paper ? he had been listening all the time ? and finished the whole passage . Probably the boy who was forever reading found in books an escape from an environment which was not uncongenial but whose demands he could not meet . He met its demands as a student in the Sauk Centre grade and high school . The education , then , was less inclusive , but in the subjects taught , more rigorous and demanding . For some reason or other , he kept many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mathematics he was very good , and some of the essays were quite astonishing for his age . He told me that he had graduated at sixteen , fifth in a class of seventeen . Mrs. Kells , who as Laura Thomason had been through high school with hint , though a class ahead , denied this . " There were nine in his class , and he should have been graduated at the top . He was easily the brightest scholar in all subjects , though he was best , of course , in English and literature . Early in high school he had something published in Scribner 's , and I remember how excited everybody was in school . But some of the teachers did n't like him ; he was too odd and had ideas of his own . " In defense of his prejudiced teachers , it must be noted that his marks in deportment were bad . His awkward , show-off antics perpetually disturbed the classroom . She recalled also that his power of observation of human behavior showed itself very early . " When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , and many of us youngsters went to see it . Harry watched with a superior air and said on the way home , ' The machine 's all right , and the principal words of the operator are toe , myself , and 1 . ' " Mrs. Ben DuBois , formerly Cecelia Gallagher , and younger than Harry , lived next door to the Lewis place and remembers only that he had remarked to her , " I do n't like cotton tops . " Her husband remembers when Harry ate grass . " I cat grass , " he had remarked ostentatiously , and promptly illustrated it by cropping the lawn on knees and elbows . This desire to call attention to himself as a compensation for normal inabilities persisted all his life . He would drag the Nobel Prize into the conversation in a most embarrassing way . He was conscious and self-critical of his showing off , but he seemed unable to help it . Sauk Centre remembers that he walked ten miles to Melrose to get a train to Minneapolis to enlist in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteen . The stationmaster , after establishing his identity , telephoned his father , who came in a two-horse rig to drive him back home . The story has it that Harry bragged to the stationmaster that he would undoubtedly be the youngest drummer boy in the army and intended to become another Richard Harding Davis . But the self-confident pose was quickly abandoned with the arrival of his irate father ( who had to pay two dollars for the buggy ) , and as he drove through Sauk Centre he was good-naturedly greeted by the jeers of his contemporaries , yelling " Doodle " and whistling Yankee Doodle . No one in Sauk Centre recalled his ever getting into a fist fight , yet there is no record that he ever had but one close boyhood friend . The committee that thought up and managed the festival , the museum , the restoration of the old home , and a scholarship fund for creative writers is not the Chamber of Commerce primarily bent on boosting the town . The driving spirit has been theeditor of the Sauk Centre Herald , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of energy . He wants to be a creative writer , " though none of us today could write like Sinclair Lewis or any of those writers of the twenties and thirties . They might pan the hell out of America , but they had n't any doubt about it . At base they were all optimists . We are n't sure whether anything will survive our own lifetimes . " Another member of the committee is Don Hipsehman , author of the pageant A . Alan front .111ain Street . He is assistant editor of the Independent Banker , published in Long Prairie , twenty miles from Sauk Centre . Others are an attorney and his wife , an investment counselor , a restaurant owner , a chain-store manager , the Episcopalian rector , and housewives with a literary interest . Mr. Hipschman 's pageant of Sinclair Lewis ' life is faithful and written with talent . It was acted on the fairgrounds after dark on a lighted stage , in a series of scenes . With a nice attention to unity , it begins and ends in the graveyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout his ghost carries on a commentary on himself , his times , and his contemporaries , most of which is taken from what he himself had written or said . It revives the incident to which eyewitnesses at the interment testify . The January day was the coldest in the year , 22 ? below zero and blustery . Dr. Claude Lewis , in pouring the ashes into his brother 's grave , spilled some over its side , and a snowy gust blew them away . " He could n't be quiet even in his grave . He 's scattered all over Stearns County . " But what does it matter where a handful of ashes lies ? What was once Sinclair Lewis is buried in no ground . Even in life he was fully alive only in his writing . He lives in public libraries from Maine to California , in worn copies in the bookshelves of women from small towns who , in their girlhood , imagined themselves as Carol Kennicotts , and of medical men who , as youths , were inspired by Martin Arrowssnith and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library . He does not live as do those few stupendous novelists revealing the human condition for all places and all times . He never really penetrated the soul . He was not a poet of either verse or prose . But he is an ineradicable part of American cultural history in the twenties and thirties , and no one seeking to recapture and record the habits , frames of mind , social movements , speech , aspirations , admirations , radicalisms , reactions , crusades , and Gargantuan absurdities of the American demos during those twenty years will be able to do without him . I did not go back to the grave .
