A Story by RICHARD ROGIN In the Company of Runners W E WALKED out across the bridge over the silently flowing Cam : Chris , the captain of the cross-country team , tall , blond , surprisingly thick-legged for a distance runner ; a serious dark-haired fellow with glasses whom I had seen run once before in the late afternoon rain , forcing himself along gamely on the half-mile leg of a medley relay ; the chaplain , still quite young , small , balding ; and myself , with apprehensive enthusiasm and a new sweat shirt for the occasion . The others would meet us out at the start . With those quick bouncy steps runners take when they go out before a race , we walked down into the alley of winter trees . It was late January , brisk and sunny , the ground damp from a touch of snow the week before . I was an American at Cambridge University , studying at King 's College . That afternoon there was to be a cross-country meet against a neighboring Royal Air Force base and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come along though I was almost a complete stranger to my college team . And I came . I was a graduate student and the restexcept for the chaplain were undergraduates . You manage to find modest and even ridiculous ways of indulging an athletic enthusiasm . For me , running combined the dreamlike challenge of time with real sensuous joy . The competitive delight was there but so was the delight of simple movement , You have made the run ; you are complete . Sports are made for heroes , champions , and occasional princes . But almost everybody was a young champion once  --  even shadow-boxing before the mirror . At some time of night we are all welterweight champions of the world . But I was never a prince nor shaped like one . When I came to Cambridge , running was in my mind as always but I did not expect to do anything official . In high school I had run the last two years  --  ordinary enjoyable half-miles. f had won some races but the league was small . However , 1 had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy and myths of speed and stamina . In the off-season of my senior year I ran round and round on a snowy board track , miles and miles . 1 contemplated success . But in the spring I was very little better than the previous year and I sloughed it off as the wrong sort of training . In the fall I went to Dartmouth College and went out for cross-country . We skipped rope and threw a medicine ball , dashed up and down the high cement steps of Memorial Field , and ran in paced packs through the woods and over the golf course , down a shady slope and home again . It was very pleasant and the company was good . I still have a certain prejudice toward the intelligence and imagination of distance runners over sprinters and weightmen . The woods were green and warm in that early Lill and I wore old track shoes that were comfortable and familiar . But I was never very good . not enough stamina nor speed . We would bunch at the start on the golf course and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the woods . After the sweaty climb there was the coolness across the open golf course ; then we would come pelting down the rocky stumbling hill with abandon before the forcing run home . We traveled to Yale when the woods were yellow and red and the runners came spilling out of the rocky hills onto the green . We loped across the great greenswards at Harvard . Sometimes there was the proper clean fatigue , that special satisfaction , the legs moving with pleasure , and sometimes it was grim and only enduring . Once my back had pained and my legs lost their luck and my ambition went somber . I trotted shamefully , with pain , refusing to walk , along the wood trail , past the brook , and came home seventeenth . Cross-country if nothing else is a thoughtful sport and a runner must have imagination and ambition , must deeply believe in what he is doing . Once that is gone , all is over . After the race we would pick up our sweat clothes in a gossiping crowd on the piney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was riot a good season ; we lost three meets and won only once . But it brought an intimacy with place and college that I would not have wished to miss . There were the wonderful hot showers , the joy of them , talking quietly , tired , in the steamy , stinging room . I would walk back to the dormitory in that long-ago autumn wills a feeling of having been somewhere , traveled to Richard Rogin studied at King 's College , Cambridge University , alter graduating from Dartmouth in 1954 . Outside of the Dartmouth literary magazine , this is his first published story.a significant destination that no one else had been to , some upland place rammed with fable . In the indoor winter season I quit . It was failure , I suppose , that caused this decision . I was n't really fast enough to enjoy the competition and there were no more woods  --  only the black cinders , round and round . I could n't lug myself around anymore without losing belief . But though I quit official running , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in later years I would turn from studying for final examinations , don my sweat clothes , and run in the night around the stadium track , going a mile in the warm breezy dark . On those nights there was no sense of distance . Or at dawn at a summer beach I would run on the edge of the sea , through the yellow , blowing foam . T H E N in the summer after my graduation I came from America to Cambridge . The bulletin hoard in the reading room was always crowded but I remember the day I found a notice for those interested in running . Because I was interested and also because when you come to a new place sometimes you bear a mobile egoism , as though of course you 'll win , I signed my name in a casual , reminiscent mood . I had deposed my knowledge of England as a great island for runners . I indulged the fable that gathers around the sport you love and were never particularly good in . Frustration gilds it ; participation makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brief autumn an unnoticed but happy runner as a Dartmouth freshman who ran through the uphill woods and over the flawless green of the golf course , past Mink Brook and home again , finishing around the middle of the pack . Now 1 was a freshman in a new place . Chris , the captain , might come around to my room and chat or we 'd stop on King 's Parade or outside Hall , but no , the American was always out of shape , too busy . I shied away from competition . It was pleasant enough to have put my name down . And then one day in January at lunch , eating shepherd 's pie , Chris said , How about coming out for a run ? They were one man short and needed just that one so the meet could be official . Would I help ? With fable in my mind and wanting to help , 1 agreed to turn up at two o'clock back of the college library and walk out to the course with them . Whom are we running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four or five miles or so . You know , I 'm rather out of shape . Just like to jog now and then . I did n't tell him that I had never run that far in my life . Quite 70 IN THE COMPANY OF RUNNERS all right , Chris said , and showed me a carefully drawn map of the course . I took a quick glance . We were to tun in a sort of long closed loop toward Grantchester and back , finishing up at the start . Well , see you at two . I 'll do my best . Two o'clock and we bounced out through the Backs , a region of lawns and river and gardens to the colleges ' rear , the greenest part of Cambridge in the spring . We walked past the hoarse writhing geese which paraded beyond the river . The start was past Grange Road , back of the Rugby grounds . The RAF chaps were already there , limbering up in faded sweat clothes , slender , long-legged , with wool skiing caps on their heads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid back to that somber painful afternoon in the woods , running all alone , far behind . The race does n't necessarily go to the swift American , the invincible stranger . We clustered , jittery , informal , at the start , looking out into the countryside down the narrow dirt road toward the fields beyond . Someone shouted , Go , and we were off . There were those first few unbelievable steps when you are nervously tired and yawny and must learn to run again and then the easy rhythm , your legs moving familiarly , dropping down in front . I had forgotten how fast a cross-country race starts off or perhaps it was a combination of memory loss and lack of condition , but in the first fifty yards I was running last , shoulder to shoulder with a RAF chap , each digging through a muddy rut to right and left of the crown of the wagon road . I had made up my mind previously that , though I was out just for the fun of it and to fill up the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muddy puddled road between high thickets , hunting for firm places , I stayed right on that RAF chap . I did n't try to sprint and catch up . The chaplain was limning strongly some distance ahead . Chris must have been out near the leaders , for I could n't see him . Then the thickets gave way to fields and we were off the road and running through a boggy , stubbly meadow , my sneakers sinking , splashing ; I was tired already in the first half-mile . The last RAF man in blue shorts and red shirt was well up ahead of me and the others were beginning to disappear across the huge field . It was an odd view of the proceedings . When we veered from the field onto a narrow winding dirt path again , I knew I would be running alone and easy for a long time ; even the next runner was out of sight . In one sense , it was quite a private affair now . My only decision was that I would n't stop . Slogging along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the curious detachment of utter defeat I watched flocks of rooks rise black and silent from the fields . The meadow was humped with three giant hayricks , huge houses with rounded tops . A pair of jet fighters whistled over , steaming by like streamlined teakettles . My course took tue first toward Grantchester . Running along I remembered walking there in the early autumn down a path much like the one 1 trotted on now , and the birds shying away down the flanking thickets . The men were in the fields in that season building the third high hayrick . I remembered a hawk shrieking , a huge white horse , fishermen along the Cam , pollarded apple trees , an English robin calling , singing in full tones , and above all , somehow , the sense of a landscape in miniature . The path led onto the Cambridge-Grantchester blacktop road and I turned left sharply , horning . The firm road felt good under my feet . A blond boy from King 's whom I had seen at the race 's start cycled toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came abreast of me . " I say there , are you part of the race ? " The lack of recognition , the abstract politeness of this question , exasperated me , but I managed to grin back a feeble , Yes . After all , he was right to query . There was nothing obvious to tell him I was part of an event . I did have a cardboard number pinned to the front of my old Dartmouth T-shirt but that was all . It looked very much as if I were running all alone , perhaps an Olympian out practicing . Several hundred yards down the road , a man who I believe started the race a hundred years ago waved me to the left again , back into the meadows on another dirt path . I smiled , Thank you , and jogged on , on my toes , easing along like a champion well within his power . I ran on and came to a confusion of muddy ruts and footprints and meadows reaching away on all sides . What was farmer and what cross-country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way I chose made me clamber with awkward fatigue over a high wooden fence . Was this the English style of cross-country racing ? The doubt stayed home to roost . I H A D lost the course as completely as a child wanders baffled through a summer wood . Somewhere ahead of me , I was sure , the winner was already striding toward the finish line to vigorous shouts of Well done , well done . " With this feeling came the first real touch of the ridiculous and then shame . Sighting the spires and towers of Cambridge I knew my general way home and I ran now at a considered moderate pace , as if forever . But for the cardboard number I could have been any sneakered eccentric jogging through the outlying streets of Cambridge , for I arrived there shortly . Trying to direct my course hack to the start I had come too close to town . Women were out walking in the streets carrying bundles from the stores . Everything was ordinary except for a red-faced , red-kneed young man in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every afternoon strengthening his legs for the next marathon . If there were any glances of mild curiosity , I passed them by with all the disdain a runner could muster who was intent on form alone . To get to where I was going I had to run back along the river , past the punt shed and the ducks , past two young mothers wheeling their baby carriages on the narrow asphalt path in the riverside park . I was still jogging , having decided that no one would be out walking in shorts in the middle of January , and only some runner , somewhat mental perhaps , would go for such a lark . I passed the Mill , a bridge and pub of the same name where the students used to sit out on the stone bridge on pleasant nights and watch the waters race or someone leap in and swim to the far shore for the laughter of it , drinking hard cider and light ale , the interior pub singing , the park whispering , lilting . My course lay through the remainder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big hanging sign for Tony Beer and Ale , and finally up West Road . In my mind I imagined that no one would be left waiting for me ; dramatically , I almost wished it . But as I rounded the Rugby field at a determined pace , finishing the wrong way home , stronger than ever , I saw three people up ahead . One was the blond boy on the bicycle who had intercepted me previously and had been cycling through the muddy bush country in search . The other two were RAF spectators who had kindly waited for no apparent reason as they showed no worry . My team had gone home to shower leaving an invitation to tea at the Copper Kettle on King 's Parade . My afternoon 's performance left me no opportunity at the time to judge the morality of the departure . Then I felt I had it coming  --  poetic justice for a sort of pride . For the first time in almost an hour or more I stopped running , stood still in shaky fatigue . 1 moved around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily but with no trouble . Surprisingly , I was not as done in as 1 thought . No one asked me what had happened . Without prompting , I apologized for being late . I had lost the course ; grinning like a clown . It seemed the proper thing to do as if you were delayed at a sherry party or had overslept in the sun . Carefully I held my sweat pants wide open with both hands and guided my legs in , then hoisted the sweat shirt over my head . And we 72 IN THE COMPANY OF RUNNERS walked back , cutting past the Garden Hostel , down the alley of bare trees , past the rusty banging geese , over the idling Cam . All I wanted now was a hot shower for my aching body , a cup of hot tea , to lie down and rest , sprawled in the old green repose of Cambridge as I had first known it that lambent afternoon arriving on the train from Liverpool Street Station and Southampton . I wanted the greenswards , house martins churring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bells from Great St. Mary 's and all the other churches of Cambridge thronging through the dusky air , tolling me to sleep . I showered with infinite pleasure , dressed , and went down to the Copper Kettle , walking slowly , carefully , on pain . But I could n't find the team in the Kettle or anywhere else along King 's Parade . Either the tea was called off or I had come too late or , again , I had lost the course . However it was , I returned gratefully to my room and collapsed on the sofa with my own hot tea and toast and jam . By dinner time I had figured my run at about six miles . Stiffly struggling into my gown , I walked over to Hall and more welcome food . I DID N'T see Chris for a day or two but then he cornered me one afternoon just inside the College gate . What happened ? Oh , T lost the course . Farce , tiny shame in my voice . And we grinned . To the team it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked ; simply , I had finished fantastically far behind . Who won ? 1 asked . The RAF chaps . How did we do ? And he mentioned that Ellison placed second , a name which I always afterward believed to be the serious dark-haired fellow with glasses but was never sure . It showed how little I knew my running companions that afternoon . They all found out about my losing the course and thought it , as I did , comic . I received some pleasant ribbing at the dinner table . What would these Americans think of next ? Happily , though with a secret sense of unreasonable affront , I noticed that I was never invited to another cross-country race . Though at the same time 1 seem to remember it both ways ; that I did indeed receive another chance to run only wisely turned it down . Perhaps they had enough men for later meets . Maybe they had enough at the time of the first race and never actually needed me ( no one seemed to be counting noses officially ) and merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference . Rut perhaps T cast aspersions on innocence . Well , they knew . There was no glitter in this impromptu effort . For memory I had a sore right foot for weeks afterward and a large piece of white cardboard , somewhat wrinkled , with the number , 165 . I never returned the number for other runners in other races as was the custom . Perhaps it deserved a quiet retirement . In the spring Chris came around several times urging me to attend the cross-country dinner . But I refused gently , firmly . I told him I did n't think I had earned my way , some such nonsense , nor did I really know the people . I did not want to be borne , even with generosity , as the stranger in the company of runners .
