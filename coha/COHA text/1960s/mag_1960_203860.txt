As someone once put it , the distinction between the minor and major poet is largely a matter of size : the greater the poet , the bigger his world . By this standard , France 's Saint-John Perse was a giant from the beginning , for he wrote of the oceans , the deserts , the globe , and of a timeless Man . His form was neither verse nor prose , and to many the vivid imagery was enigmatic , possibly cryptic , as in Seamarks ( 1954 ) : <P> <P> The Sea . . . on its confines , under its falconry of white clouds , like a tax-free domain and like entailed land , like a province of rank weeds that was wagered on the dice . <P> <P> Saint-John Perse is the pen name of Alexis Saint-Lger Lger , 73 , a diplomat who wrote poetry in secret after his day 's work at the Quai d'Orsay in Paris , where he served for years as Secretary-General of the French Foreign Ministry . ' ' Is this true , Leger , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare time ? " asked Aristide Briand of his faithful assistant . " It is. " replied the writer firmly , " an imposture . " <P> When war came . Lger 's refusal to join the Vichy regime brought him disgrace and exile to the U.S .. where Poet Archibald MacLeish , then Librarian of Congress , gave him a $45-a-week job collating bibliographies in the stacks . He has lived in Washington ever since ; now , with a more lucrative contract from his publisher , he can afford an annual trip to the French Riviera . He never talks European politics in public , though he knew the secrets of 15 years of French diplomacy . His comments were saved for Chronicle , his latest work , which ends : " Summit of time , here are we ! Measure the heart of man ! " <P> In the Washington phone book , he remained plain " Alexis Leger . " When a publisher requested poems for an anthology , he replied : " My name does not belong to letters .

For his work in the Congo as U.N . Secretary-General , Hammarskjold was an obvious candidate for the 1960 Peace award . But the Nobel deadline for nominations is Jan. 31. long before the Congo emergency appeared . With Hammarskjold ruled out on this technicality ( and perhaps with an eye toward avoiding controversy with Hammarskjold 's vociferous detractor , Nikita Khrushchev ) , the committee decided to make no award .
