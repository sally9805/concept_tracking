txt Late in the afternoon of April 6 , 1964 , Sen. Thomas J. Dodd of Connecticut took off on a flight to West Germany . On the surface , at least , there 's nothing unusual about such a trip . Senators are always taking trips to one part of the world or another . And there was nothing unusual about the appointments he had with West German leaders ? they were scheduled as nothing more than routine courtesy calls . But charges that he took the six-day trip to Germany to promote the private business interests of Julius Klein have landed him in the middle of a hassle nobody likes . Mr. Klein is an American registered as an agent for West German business interests . The Senate Ethics Committee is charged with finding the facts , " This is obviously going to be unpleasant , " said Sen. Wallace F. Bennett ( R ) of Utah , vice-chairman of the committee . " We did n't seek this responsibility . It is one we would like to have had pass us by . " Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prisoner in a West German prison , Bogdan Stashinsky , identified by Senator Dodd as " a confessed member of the Soviet murder apparatus . " The Senator said the trip fulfilled his responsibilities for the Senate internal security subcommittee . Senator Dodd explained that the investigalion , made in cooperation with officials of the German Government and the United States embassy , resulted in a subcommittee report entitled , " Murder International , Inc . " But documents admittedly taken secretly from the Senator 's private flies suggest an ? other story . James P. Boyd Jr. , a former Dodd staff member , and one of four who took around 4,000 documents , says Senator Dodd went to Germany at the insistence of Mr. Klein . At that time , Mr. Klein had been suffering serious loss of business as the result of the Fulbright investigations into the lobbies for foreign business interests . Mr. Klein had appeared before these hearings . As a result of the publicity given the Fulbright hearings , and Mr. Klein 's role in them , German companies , including Daimler-Benz , Mannesmann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts with Mr. Klein . Mr. Boyd testified that Mr. Klein wanted Senator Dodd to talk to German leaders to refurbish Mr. Klein 's tarnished image . " My belief was that the Stashinsky , affair was a cover-up , " charged Mr. Boyd . The subcommittee counsel , Benjamin R. Fern , filed with the subcommittee a dossier of 81 documents he said came from Senator Dodd 's files . Among the items Mr. Fern read into the record from these documents were extracts which Mr. Fern said were : ? An Oct. 22 , 1963 , telegram from Mr. Klein to members of the Senate , complain* // * Dodd 's six - day trip to Germany queried // ing of the Foreign Relations Committee inquiry . " This hearing has cost my firm thousands of dollars in business . .. " it said in part . $100,000 loss cited ? A Dec. 17 , 1963 , letter to Senator Dodd , with a canceled contract attached , in which Mr. Klein said : " This alone brings me a $100,000 loss . .. . I hope something can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dated Dec. 17 , 1963 , and marked confidential , in which Mr. Klein told Senator Dodd he feared two options with German clients might not be renewed and said " ... Let 's discuss this matter on the phone . " ? A message dated Dec. 23 , 1963 , in which Mr. Klein told Senator Dodd : " Hope you will answer the committee smear against me . " ? A letter of Jan. 20 , 1964 , in which Max Klein said his brother Julius was awaiting word on a Dodd trip to Europe . ? A telegram Mr. Klein sent Senator Dodd on Feb. 2 , 1964 , saying in part : " Whenever you come it will be helpful and appreciated . " ? A letter in which Mr. Klein told Senator Dodd he was sorry the Senator 's trip had been postponed , and another in which Mr. Klein outlined a list of West German officials he wanted Senator Dodd to see . Privacy suggested " I suggest You see them alone , without anyone from the embassy or the foreign office , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was a sheaf of memos suggesting an approach to each of the German officials  --  among them Chancellor Ludwig Erhard . One segment of the memo on the suggested visit to Chancellor Erhard said the Chancellor should be told : " We in Congress have to rely on the assistance of General Klein . . . in regard to the federal German republic . . . the help of General Klein has been of great assistance to us . . . " Another memo , suggesting an approach to German Foreign Minister Gerhard Schriider said : " Use the contents of the Erhard memo . " A former Washington representative for Mr. Klein , Miss Helen E. Batherson , was asked by Mr. Fern if Mr. Klein had " encouraged " Senator Dodd to take the trip . Tells of letters She testified she had seen copies of letters to Senator Dodd from Mr. Klein " asking the Senator to do this . " She added that Mr. Klein " is a very persuasive man . " Also : " General Klein called Senator Dodd on innumerable occasions to intervene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing clients . I know he called on any number of occasions . " Miss Batherson added cryptically : " But he was n't the only senator involved . . ? he asked several senators to do the same thing . . . because he had lost favor with his German clients . . . . " The subcommittee counsel did not ask for elaboration . Moral issue raised Subcommittee chairman , John Stennis ( D ) of Mississippi asked Mr. Boyd if he had considered his removal of thousands of documents from Senator Dodd 's files as a possible criminal offense . " I thought there was a possibility , yes , sir , " Mr. Boyd replied . " But I decided it could not be illegal if it was morally right . " He added that he thought when all the factors were weighed , " it would be determined not to be a violation of law " and would not result in his being prosecuted . He said he and the others involved in the removal of the documents were faced with a situation in which " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He added they felt they had an obligation " to inform the public and the authorities of what was going on " but decided against going either to a Senate committee or the FBI until they had the documentation for their charges . " The only other source available to us was the public , " he said , explaining his reason for turning the information over to columnists Drew Pearson and Jack Anderson . Charge denied He said that " at no time have I or others involved ever received a cent of compensation or gratuity of any kind . " If those making allegations against the Senator are agreed on the purpose of the trip , they have come up with no clear mo- tive to attribute to Senator Dodd for these reported actions . Early in the hearings , in a confusing and emotion-packed few minutes , Mrs. Marjorie Carpenter , a former Dodd secretary , thought she knew it . She said she had overheard " speculation " that Senator Dodd " must have " been paid at least $10,000 by Mr. Klein for his trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has requested the Attorney General to initiate perjury proceedings against her . After the Senator returned from Europe , she said , she overheard a conversation in her office between two Dodd aides , David Martin and Gerard Zeiller . Conversation related The conversation , as she said she recalled it , went like this : Martin . " I wonder how much Klein paid Senator Dodd for this ? " Zeiller . With what Mrs. Carpenter described as a chuckle " Oh , I 've known Klein for years , ever since I worked in Senator Bridges ' office . " Martin . " He must have paid at least $10,000 . " Zeiller . " Oh , easily ; at least that . " Mrs. Carpenter added that it was just " speculation . " Both Martin and Zeiller later took the stand to deny ever having had such a convei sa hon. Earlier Mr. Boyd testified that Mr. Klein had made a New York apartment available to Senator Dodd , and that he used it on an average of once a month . Miss Batherson echoed this testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends to use it . " Because the names are so big , and the implications so far-reaching , long-time observers of Congress describe the proceedings as having " an air of unreality . " But for senators , the hearings may be just little too real for comfort . At least some of them are probably watching their staff assistants with new caution .
