" Some people said it could n't be done , " said United Steelworkers President David McDonald , " but we 've done it . " " A significant development in the history of collective bargaining , " agreed R. Conrad Cooper , a U.S. Steel vice president and the industry 's chief negotiator . The White House passed on word that President Kennedy was " gratified . " <P> The news was not unexpected , but that did not dampen its revolutionary impact . After 51 months of meetings , labor and management agreed on a 13-week paid sabbatical vacation once every five years ( on a rotating basis ) for all hourly workers in the top half of the seniority ranks at each steel company . In all of U.S. industry , only the canmakers have even a roughly similar agreement , and Dave McDonald has been trying to get one from the steelmakers for seven years . <P> McDonald also won higher sickness , accident and health insurance benefits - but no wage hike . In return , the union promised management a contract guaranteeing no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold off a strike for 120 days after a contract reopening instead of the present 90 days . At a cost of roughly 8 an hour on a yearly basis , the new contract granted the smallest increases in the industry since World War II and was well within the limits of a noninflationary settlement asked of all unions by President Kennedy . <P> The sabbaticals will give steelmakers a lot of bookkeeping problems , but the union regards the three-month paid holiday as one answer to automation . McDonald figures that senior employees going on long vacations will create up to 25,000 new jobs for people who will have to fill in for them . Even at that , the union will not wholly offset job losses in the steel industry . Steel is automating so fast that in March , with 25,000 fewer workers , it turned out nearly a million more tons of steel than it did last year .
