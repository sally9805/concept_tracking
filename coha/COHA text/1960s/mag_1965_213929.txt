How to Murder Your Wife is a nimble comedy that does n't make much sense because it makes nonsense , most of it screechingly funny and played by knockabouts who know that the slapstick was invented for keeping an idea aloft , not for beating it into the ground . Jack Lemmon , too often compelled to flail around in boudoirs as the All-American lecher , demonstrates that he can wipe the leer off his face and make homicidal impulses more hilarious than hard breathing . <P> Scene of the crime is an improbable Manhattan town house where Cartoonist Lemmon , abetted by his man Friday , Terry-Thomas , draws a James Bondish comic strip called Bash Brannigan . The place is a boy 's garden of sex and violence . " No gay little chintzes , no big gunky lamps , the complete absence of a woman 's touch , " gloats Terry-Thomas . But one night at a bachelor dinner , someone wheels in a gigantic cake that gives forth a frosted blonde ( Virna Lisi ) , and Lemmon , anesthetized by alcohol , begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tooth . <P> Next morning , beside himself , he finds the blonde-with a wedding ring on her finger . He has not only had his cake , he has married her too . Some joke , he begins bravely . How would she like a divorce ? The blonde smiles agreeably and noncommittally shrugs : ' Non capisco . " She no spek Engleesh . He non parla Italiano . <P> After that crisis , Wife amiably describes how a fighting-trim bachelor becomes a fat , happy benedict . Lemmon 's lady smothers him with love and stuffs him with pasta until he has rings under his eyes and a bulge over his belt . Dragging his paunch through the men's-club swimming pool , he makes the mere act of floating seem a wry comment on the leaden responsibilities of marriage . Even Bash Brannigan evolves into a folksy domestic series called The Brannigans . Finally , Lemmon rebels . Both he and Bash decide to dispose of their mates by dumping them ( Brrrp ! Blasp ! ) into cement mixers . " A tomb of gloop from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murder plot itself , and the mock trial that follows it , Writer George Axelrod ( The Seven Year Itch ) and Director Richard Quine make the mistake of thinking that the muse of comedy is a rubber-limbed contortionist , and sometimes stretch the fun to the breaking point . Luckily , the supporting cast shows such spirit that Lemmon has to work hard for his share of the laughs . As the gentlemen 's gentleman who would not hesitate one moment to help rub out a superfluous lady , Terry-Thomas hyphenates the movie with tomfoolery , holding whole scenes together by letting his face fall apart like a piece of shattered Limoges.
