In eight states and parts of Canada , on the evening of Nov. 9 , 1965 , lights started to flicker and fade . The Big Blackout had begun . Before the Northeast groped its way back to normalcy , more than 4,000,000 man-hours of productivity were lost . The total is incomplete ; it can not be fully tabulated until Where Were You When the Lights Went Out ? ends its run . Figure 1 wasted man-hours per viewing . <P> Like the actual event on which it is tenuously based , the picture begins brightly . A company treasurer ( Robert Morse ) is in the process of absconding to Brazil with the company funds when the power failure overtakes him at the scene of the crime . He quickly gloms an abandoned auto from a traffic jam and heads for Boston , where an airport is still functioning . But he gets only as far as the exurbs . <P> End of the comic promise and beginning of a vapid farce of mistaken-identity crises . Morse 's co-star is Doris Day , playing a pulpy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he blunders into by mistake . To disarm audiences-and possibly critics-she sometimes refers to herself as the Constant Virgin , a sobriquet Doris has actually earned in half a dozen previous films , pursued by the likes of Gary Grant and Rock Hudson but remaining a freckle-faced iron maiden to the fadeout . In this picture , she is equipped with a husband ( Patrick O'Neal ) , but by pouting continually , she keeps him at arm 's length . Morse , drugged on her sleeping potion , never gets to make anything but frantic motions . Thus if she is no longer precisely virginal , she remains constant . <P> Doris Day fans , if there are any left , would be better off waiting for her new situation-comedy series on TV this fall . At worst , it will be only half a man-hour wasted .
