Notes and Comment ANUMBER of earnest and intelligent writers have expressed their dismay recently at the foolish sideshows that cluster about the grave ceremony of inaugurating a new President . The balls and bands and fatuous floats , they say , diminish the greatness of the occasion . We can see their point , and particularly when the ceremony marks the orderly and civilized transfer of the real stuff of power from men of one persuasion to men of another . This is a remarkable human accomplishment , and one that deserves much solemn thought . To see an entire nation peacefully altering its political direction is quite as astonishing , in its way , as it would be to see a continent spontaneously hitching itself into a new alignment with the polestar . But until America becomes a nation of philosophers ( it wo n't happen tomorrow ) there is likely to be a lot of amiable foolishness mingled with all our serious political occasions . Nor can we entirely agree with those who object to this disorderly state of affairs . The mood of Inauguration Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Eve , when the hands of the clock move toward midnight . Amid the whoops and the horseplay , everyone usually finds a moment to ponder the events that lie behind him and the prospects that dimly loom before . And New Year 's Eve is only a convention of the calendar-makers . The sentiment induced by that arbitrary date is at least equally , natural to an occasion on which the nation , by its votes , has drawn a line under its immediate past and begun a new calculation of its future . Perhaps , after all , it is not the new year that produces the resolution but the resolution that produces the truly new year . To President Eisenhower , we offer our best wishes for an unruffled retiremerit . To President Kennedy , we extend the appalling burden of our hopes . Ex THERE are now three living ex-Presidents of the United States . Having , as they say in the law , no independent recollection of such a state of affairs , we 've taken the trouble to see whether the Messrs . Hoover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our history . Far from it , says history , giving us a dark look ; the situation may have been rare in recent times , but in the good old days ex-Presidents were a commonplace . In fact , there have been only two inaugurations at which no ex-Presidents were alive , and these , as you 've no doubt already guessed , were Washington 's first and second , in 1789 and 1793 . Since then , it has been the case more often than not that at least two ex-Presidents were alive on Inauguration Day . To spell this out precisely , of the total of fifty-one inaugurations that have been held between 1789 and 1961 , thirty-four have been lived through by at least two ex-Presi dents , seventeen have been lived through by at least three ex-Presidents , four by at least four ex-Presidents , and one by five . The first of our dozen trios consisted of John Adams , Thomas Jefferson , and James Madison , who lived through both of James Monroe 's inaugurations , in 1817 and 1821 , and the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant , Hayes , and Arthur , who saw Cleveland inaugurated fur the first time , in 1885 . All three of these men were dead when Cleveland was inaugurated for the second time , in 1893 . Cleveland and Hayes were the only two ex-Presidents alive when Cleveland 's successor , Benjamin Harrison , took office , and ( strictly speaking ) Cleveland and Harrison were the only two ex-Presidents alive at Cleveland 's own second inauguration . Cleveland was the only living ex-President when Roosevelt succeeded McKinley . The first inauguration at which the country could boast of having four living ex-Presidents was that of John Quincy Adams , in 1825 , and the four were Jefferson , Madison , Monroe , and Dad . The next four-ex inauguration was Polk 's , in 1845 , when John Quincy Adams , Jackson , Van Buren , and Ty ler were all alive . When Buchanan took office , in 1857 , there was a quartet consisting of Van Buren , Tyler , Fill-more , and Pierce . At the time of Lincoln 's first inauguration , in 1861 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fillmore , Pierce , and Buchanan . Van Buren , who was born in 1782 and died in 1862 , holds the undisputed title of **26;2144;TOOLONG e n-succeed-him-than-a n y - other ; the number was eight , and the eight were Harrison , Tyler , Polk , Taylor , Fillmore , Pierce , Buchanan , and Lincoln . One last statistical fact , suitable for speculating on in bars , very late at night : Mr. Hoover , who has lived to see four men succeed him in office , at a total of nine inaugurations , is , of all the ex-Presidents who have been the only one living at the inauguration of a successor , the only one to have been the only one at the inauguration of inure than one . Ambassador Stevenson ONE of the quietest places in town just before the inauguration was the headquarters of the United States Mission to the United Nations , at 2 Park Avenue , and there , last week , we came upon Adlai Stevenson . He was en route from Libertyville , Illinois , to Washington , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ambassador to the U.N. , and he was temporarily using an office on the nineteenth floor . The floor was watched over by a sleepy-looking guard , and rows of unoccupied , slightly dusty desks , each bearing a rectangular green desk blotter and a telephone , led to a small corner office whose door was tabbed " MR STEVENSON . " The office was gray and impersonal , its only decoration a dark painting of Abraham Lincoln The new Ambassador looked bright indeed  --  his face sunburned , his bald head freckled , his back hair freshly clipped , his eyes Palm Beach blue and clear behind a desk stacked with let-ters and notes , printed , typewritten , and scribbled . An outsize caramel-colored briefcase with a gaping top was at Stevenson 's feet . These were encased in badly scuffed but nicely polished brown shoes , and , for the rest , he was outfitted in a dark-blue1pin-striped suit that looked tight on him ; a light-blue shirt with French cuffs , gold cufflinks , and a straight silver pin at the collar ; and a dark-blue necktie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk , he pushed the briefcase to one side , giving it a somewhat tolerant look . " I have an enormous collection of briefcases , and this one is one of my mistakes , " he said . " It 's divided into compartments , which at first I thought would be efficient . Now I find that when you try to stuff things in , you twin into compartments . What I would like is some time to work on a large accumulation of undisposed-of mail . Every time I try to get at it , I have to make telephone calls to people about appointments and personnel . I have just now come from a long-deferred engagement with Mrs. Roosevelt . I wanted to see her about various problems of the United Nations and some other things she wished to talk about . 1 have n't had an opportunity to get to know the staff here As soon as I take over officially , I 'll go around and call on them in their offices . " The phone rang . The Ambassador spoke to somebody about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung up . " My goodness ! " he said , turning back to us . " The things you have to do in order to live here ! Our government puts the Ambassador up in an apartment at the top of the Waldorf Towers . It 's a handsome apartment . Very handsome . And equipped Like an embassy abroad , with a living room , a dining room that will accommodate forty people , and  --  let 's see  --  one , two , three , four , Eve bedrooms and five baths , and a full pantry and bar , and cabinets with beautiful china and all that . But the kitchen is empty . I 'm going to need pots and pans to cook with , and there 's not a pot or a pan in the place . I 'm bringing my housekeeper , Viola Ready , from the farm at Libertyville . I like to cook when she will let me and there is time , which is n't often . Mostly , what I do is mix up what 's left over . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I may have a kitchen shower . I have a birthday coming up February 5th . My friends always give parties for my birthday , and I think this time I 'll ask them to give me a kitchen shower . " He threw not say , oh , to be fifty again ! " We asked the Ambassador whether he thought he 'd like living at the Waldorf . " I 'm sure love the view , " he said diplomatically . " I 've never really enjoyed living in big cities . I 'm a country boy . : I love the feeling of the country . I love being on my farm , and I hope to be able to get back there occasionally for weekends . My children and grandchildren spend holidays with me at the farm . I have three grandchildren . Of my sons , Adlai III is the only one who 's married so far , and they 're his children -- -Adlai Stevenson IV , Lucy Wallace Stevenson , and Katherine Randolph Stevenson . They 're four years , two and a half years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the two older ones are at that rough and roly-poly stage where they 're beginning to talk and seem virtually indestructible . Lucy Wallace is a little tougher than the boy , at this stage . She 's named for her Great-Great-Great-Aunt Lucy , who is . Mrs. A. Kingsley Porter the widow of A. Kingsley Porter , who was a distinguished archeologist at Harvard Aunt Lucy lives in the James Russell Lowell house , Elmwood , in Cambridge . She 's now very frail , very delicate , and very old . How old we 're not sure . Aunt Lucy is a favorite of all my boys . All three of them went to Harvard , and while they were there , all three had the great pleasure of Sunday dinner with Aunt Lucy  --  the best dinner of the week . I love to read to the two older grandchildren . They always ask me to read to them . I 'm impressed with their power of concentration . I ca n't say I have any special favorites among their books at this stage . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wind in the Willows . ' " The phone rang again . Mr. Stevenson listened attentively for a few minutes , and then said , " Oh , no , please , I would n't want her to go to all that trouble . My goodness ! Making two telephone calls , and all that . " After he had hung up , we asked him how he liked his new headquarters . " I believe I 'll be in an office upstairs somewhere , " he said . " As I remember , I lived in these very offices in 1946 and 1947 , right along this corridor  --  in this very one , or one or two down . We were all strung out along here . I started with this business in San Francisco in 1945 , at the conference at which the United Nations Charter was written and adopted . Before that , I 'd spent a good deal of time abroad . I 've always loved to travel . In 1926 , as a newspaperman , I had gone all across the Soviet Union and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations . I 'd had considerable grounding in foreign affairs , and all through the Second World War I 'd been assistant to Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox . I 'd been at the front in most of the war theatres . Pd travelled a great deal with Frank Knox , and also on missions for President Roosevelt , including a survey mission to relieve the suffering and restore the economy of Italy . I 'd seen the misery , waste , destruction , and savagery of war , so , as time went on , I 'd become more and more concerned with the problems of maintaining peace . After Secretary Knox died , I resigned and returned to my law practice in Chicago . But I was then asked to come back to Washington by Archibald MacLeish , my long-time friend in the State Department , to work on plans for the United Nations . I 'd intended to go only to the San Francisco conference and after that go back to my law practice in Illinois . When the conference was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Senate ratification of the Charter , and after the Senate voted for the Charter , I went back home . But then Jimmy Byrnes , our new Secretary of State , asked me to come hack to the Department and go with the United Nations to London . So , after V- J Day , I went to London with him by ship , the Queen Mary -- a troop transport she was then . I became deputy to former Secretary of State Stettinius as our government 's representative un the Executive Committee to set up the machinery for the first United Nations Assembly . Stettinius soon fell ill , and replaced him as chairman of the United States delegation to the Preparation Commission , which put the flesh on the bare hones of the United Nations Charter . I stayed in London for six months , through the first meeting of the first General Assembly of the United Nations , in January and February of 1946 . I inherited General Eisenhower 's office at 20 Grosvenor Square , which he had occupied before D Day . Our delegation to that first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Vandenberg , Senator Connolly , Mrs. Roosevelt , John Foster Dulles , and Congressmen Bloom , of New York , and Eaton , of New Jersey . Because I had worked with the U.N . from birth to adolescence , the delegaLion looked to me for advice on almost everything , and I felt more competent then , I confess , than I do now . " After that General Assembly meeting in London , I again went hack to my law practice in Illinois , but then I was appointed to our government 's delegation for the next General Assembly , and I spent the autumn of 1946 working at U.N . headquarters , which was then at Lake Success . Again , I felt very much in touch with things , and deeply involved , emotionally and intellectually , with the U.N . I represented our government on various issues in the committees . After the third General Assembly , in 1947 , I left again to go hack to Illinois . I was almost at once asked to run for Governor . And thus began my meteoric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ? " went up and down with some rapidity . " " Anything different in your approach to the U.N . now ? " we asked . " I was much younger then , and I think I 'm more realistic about some things now , " he said . " But the intervening years have n't destroyed my hope and confidence in the U.N . Certainly I 've been disillusioned about how soon we can achieve what we 're working for , and about some of the infinite difficulties  --  the Russian expansion , the stubborn trouble in the Middle East , the consolidation of Communist power in China , the difficulty , of maintaining solidarity among the Western countries , the effect of thirty new countries on the old prewar balance , the growth of atomic weapons , the speed with which the old empires have dissolved to create new independence and instability , the African tumult , the new societies that have arisen , and all the changes and torments of the period in which we live . We originally worked to create an organization to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League of Nations and after living through the war . The League of Nations had worked hard to reduce the threat of war , and then there was a war . With the new machinery , our hearts were full of hope that the everlasting curse of war might he controlled , if not extinguished , by the organization of international society for collective security . The U.N . was a step in that direction . Up to the Kennedy administration , the United States Mission has been treated as an embassy , to execute orders from the State Department . Now I hope to spend JANUARY 28e 1 9 6 1 more time in Washington participating in the formulation of policy and shall have something to say about the orders I must execute . I have not lost any of my faith in the United Nations . It will he difficult . The United States has been on the defensive too much of late , and the Afro-Asian nations now have a majority . Many are neutralist and want no part of the Cold War . No longer can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will happen to public opinion in our country when we begin to lose votes , and decisions go against us now and then . But I still have confidence , and I still have hope . One thing has remained constant ; the fact that the United States , in spite of its frustrations , has had no recurrence of isolation or clamor to withdraw from the world scene . We ca n't withdraw . We dare not withdraw . " W bite Tie OUR man Stanley blew into the office the other day wearing a rented topper and the cool , detached expression of a man who has seen history in the making . " Jacqueline is yummy , " he said cryptically , and deposited the following dispatch : " Have been to Inaugural Ball , in Washington . ' Ben-Hue intimate , cozy affair by comparison .
