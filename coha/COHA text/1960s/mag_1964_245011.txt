Cautiously an Israeli patrol advanced along the narrow gravel road , sweeping for mines . Immediately to its left were the bubbling springs that form the headwaters of the River Dan . A few feet to its right , a white plastic ribbon marked the Syrian border . From the grey stone hills beyond , two shots rang out , and suddenly the whole area erupted into battle . Syrian mortar shells fell on three Israeli villages ; Israeli jets bombed two Syrian settlements . Altogether , 10 people were killed and 37 wounded . <P> It was one of the worst outbreaks of Israeli-Arab violence since the 1956 Sinai-Suez crisis , and it brought the U.N . Security Council into emergency session . What the council heard about seemed to be a battle of inches . Accusing Israel of " wanton aggression , " Syria 's U.N . Ambassador Rafik Asha charged that the gravel road on which the Israeli patrol had been traveling was 50 yards inside the Syrian border . Not so , replied Israeli Ambassador Michael Comay angrily : according to a 1962 U.N @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border , and on the Israeli side . <P> The real issue was not the road at all , but water . Israel and the Arab states are contending for the Jordan River waters , and the Dan in turn supplies half the total volume of the Jordan . Biblically , the headwaters were granted to Israel by a divine deed registered in the Book of Judges . Historically , Israel 's claims go back to a 1923 agreement when the headwaters were placed inside Palestine . The trouble is that the Syrian-Israel border was vaguely drawn and has been disputed ever since . <P> Syrian President Amin Hafez recently has been calling for war against Israel " at the earliest date . " Such Arab threats-and Israeli counterthreats- have been heard before . Nevertheless , the water war seems to be heading for a showdown .
