MEMED MY HAWK ( 371 pp. ) - Yashar Kemal-Pantheon ( $4.95 ) . <P> Turkish literature , little of which has ever penetrated to the U.S. , has always been derivative . For hundreds of years , Turkish poets imitated those of Persia ; in the 19th and 20th centuries , the model has been France . This lively first novel skillfully blends both traditions with a strong individualistic note of its own and suggests that U.S. readers may have been missing something . Beautifully translated by Edouard Roditi , the book tells the story of young Memed who grows up in a mud-walled village hut in a remote province of Anatolia . Recklessly brave and a deadly marksman , Memed battles his environment and a succession of superb villains . Chief among them : sly , goat-bearded Abdi Agha , who owns five villages and combines the brutality of Simon Legree with the buffoonery of Captain Hook . Readers will have to remind themselves from time to time that all this is happening in the 20th century . <P> As a child , Memed runs away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young man , he elopes with the village belle on the eve of her marriage to Abdi 's nephew . Tracked down in the forest , Memed loses his girl but kills the nephew and escapes to the crags and hidden valleys of the Taurus mountains , where he joins a band of outlaws and finally becomes a Turkish Robin Hood . After a dozen gunfights , in which bursts of Homeric rhetoric alternate with bursts of grenades and guns , Memed at last avenges himself by murdering his goat-bearded enemy , Abdi Agha . Then , like a proper hero , he rides off into the sunrise and is never seen again . <P> Fantastic though it seems , Author Yashar Kemal , 39 , has lived much of his novel . Village-born , of Kurdish descent , Kemal was five years old when his father was murdered by an enemy while kneeling beside his son in the mosque . The experience left Kemal with a stammer , which he cured by chanting the traditional songs of Turkish troubadours . This folk poetry glows in his description of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if " a green rain has fallen , " and by midsummer , the high plateaus are blue with thistles " rippling like the sea . " There is also the settled villagers ' nostalgia for a happier nomadic past , and repeated echoes of Nasr-ed-Din , the great comic hero whose wit and clownish wisdom have enlivened Turkish bazaars for 700 years . For the most part the author 's philosophy seems to reflect Memed 's own mood , benign in the midst of violence : " What good men there are in the world ! "
