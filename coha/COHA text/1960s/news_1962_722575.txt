txt Letters to The Times pg . 23 Letters to The Times A. M. A. for Fluoridation Association 's Position Declared Misrepresented by Opposition To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMEs : I am writing to correct a false representation of the position of the American Medical Association on the fluoridation of public water supplies which appeared in the letters columns of the July 14 issue of your paper . This false representation resulted from the use of a statement taken , entirely out of context , from a letter written by an A. M. A. representative , The only official statement of the position of the A. M. A. on this subject is contained in a twentyfour-page booklet entitled " Statement on Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies by the House of Delegates of the American Medical Asciation . " Copies of this booklet may be obtained from the A. M. A. , 535 North Dearborn Street , Chicago 10 , Ill . The booklet contains a report of the study on which the policy decision of the A. M. A. was based , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delegates , the only body in the A. M. A. authorized to make policy decisions . The purport of all of this material may be briefly but accurately summarized in the following excerpt from the statement adopted by the House of Delegates : " . . fluoridation of public water supplies is a safe and practical method of reducing the incidence of dental caries during childhood . . . . " I hope that in the future those persons who oppose the fluoridation of public water supplies will refrain from misrepresenting the position of the A. M. A. on this vitally important subject . Matters of such great public concern should be decided on the basis of true facts rather than false representations . RICHARD P. BERGEN , Staff Attorney , American Medical Association . Chicago , Aug. 8 , 1962. many countries of Latin America ? often have large Communist oppositions . My argument is brief and therefore over-simplified , but it ought to caution those who , like Professor FitzGibbon , consider liberalism with its belief in free discussion to be a " virus . " On the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communism and the sophisms of Professor FitzGibbon . FRANK MYERS . Kearny , N. J. , Aug. 4 , 1962 . Proposal for Foley Square Federal Project Deferment Urged Until City 's Plan Is Adopted To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The Architects Council welcomes Mayor Wagner 's recent call for " additional open space . .. particularly along the westerly facade " of the proposed forty-one-story $80,000,000 Federal building on Foley Square . We are , however , deeply concerned by the concluding sentence of the Mayor 's wire to Senator Jacob K. Javits . " However , in no event do we want to hold up or delay the Federal building program . " This implies an architecturally disastrous compromise by the city . It would allow Washington first . to erect the Federal building on an admittedly inadequate site ? and later , perhaps , provide " additional open space . . . along the westerly facade . " Such a course inhibits present planning and portends irreparable harm to the proper future redevelopment of the entire center . There is no emergency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , it was due to growing awareness of the fact that our 1949 master plan was obsolete that the Board of Estimate ordered a new study of the City Hall-Foley Square district . No authorization for any construction in this area ought to be permitted by any committee or department -- city , state or Federal ? until after the new master plan has been publicly aired and officially adopted . Library Explains Inspection To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES We are sorry , indeed , that Theresa Irene Fallon , whose letter was published on Aug. 6 , seems to have had such an unpleasant experience in the library . We should like to reassure Miss Fallon on two points : It is not now nor has it ever been the policy of the library to inspect women 's " handbags . " Attendants are required to check readers ' ( men 's and women 's ) briefcases , suitcases , portfolios , tote bags ? in short , any large container . Rude or discourteous behavior by any staff member is never countenanced , let alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A statement to the effect that briefcases , etc. , will be checked is posted at both entrances of the Fifth Avenue library and is in line with the library 's responsibility to protect in the public interest its ' arious collections of books , some of which are intended for circulation , and , therefore , may be taken out of the building , while others are reference materials and must remain in the building so as to be available at all times . HARALD OSTVOLD , Acting Director , the New York Public Library . New York , Aug. 8 , 1962 . Free Discussion Backed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Prof. John FitzGibbon , in his letter published Aug. 4 , is wrong on two counts in his attack on the liberal belief in free political discussion . First , he implies that we should not heed John Stuart Mill 's assurance that " free discussion would insure that truth prevail . " Actually this statement misrepresents Mill in his essay " On Liberty . " Mill said , rather , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can-be uncovered and made a living truth . Censorship leads either to the suppression of truth or to its becoming a mere blind prejudice . Of course Mill realized that falsehood might prevail in a free discussion . Secondly , Professor FitzGibbon states that liberals are " incurably optimistic " to believe that " a healthy ( i. e. , democratic ) body politic will readily resist the ideological poison of communism . " But if one adds economic wealth to " democratic " in one 's definition of " healthy , " it is the simplest realism to assume that 3. healthy democracy  --  with free dislussion  --  can well resist communism . Nations which are prosperous and iemocratic  --  for example , the United states , Canada , Great Britain ? have no large Communist movements . Nations which for years have Known poverty and suppression of Free discussion -- Italy , , Spain , Japan , Three-Sided Site The present Federal site is threesided and cut off in the middle of the block . We must extend the site to Broadway and pull the building back out of Foley Square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square to the monumental proportions essential for a government center of national significance . Under the proposed plan space needed to underpass traffic would be unobstructed , permitting the creation of a landscaped traffic-free pedestrian plaza . The vista down Lafayette Street to the classic clock tower on City Hall would be preserved . ( This vista would be blocked by the eight-story wing that is to jut out and straddle Elk Street . ) The Federal building would then impressively be seen and approached from all four sides . ' We could then dispense with the blank westerly wall . Washington has asserted that it will not await the city 's new master plan , but intends to award a construction contract during October , 1962 . Congressional authorization and an increased appropriation for additional land and revision of plans would materially delay the project . But Washington would not defy a clear-cut official request from the City of New York , asking that it wait . We strongly urge Mayor Wagner to make such a request before it is too late . NATHAN R. GINSBURG , A. I. A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York City . New York , Aug. 3 , 1962 . Costliness of Moon Project To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your series of articles on Project Apollo , designed to send three Americans to the moon , makes fascinating reading . Indeed the prospects of such a successful venture are exhilarating  --  except for these aspects : There is no question that the race to the moon holds portents of extending the cold war into outer space and planets . And this would place in even greater jeopardy the life ' of every one of us on earth . Also , as long as infants live in rotting homes where they can be gnawed on by rats , as long as millions of people in so many lands are " living " on starvation rations , as long as we have such a deficit in school buildings and competent teachers , as long as there is such a crying need for so many things to be done down here below  --  does it make any sense to spend some twenty billion dollars to rocket ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N. Y. , Aug. 3 , 1962.
