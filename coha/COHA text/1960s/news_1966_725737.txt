txt August is Japan 's annual month of trauma over Hiroshima , the month when she rededicates her spirit to the pacifist gods unloosed by the mushroom cloud . Each August for 20 years , Japan 's ' popular magazines devoted their editions to Hiroshima , to the world nuclear threat . But not this year . The annual pilgrimages were made ; the peace demonstrations , thoroughly confused by the rivalry of pro-Peking and pro-Moscow factions , took place . But something has changed in Japan . Whether she speaks of it publicly or only privately in the quiet of the teahouse , Japan is moving toward rearmament and , almost certainly , toward possession of nuclear , weapons . As in India , Japan 's politicians do not yet talk frankly on nuclear matters . But confidentially they concede that China 's nuclear bomb has changed the whole question . " How can we ignore it ? " a Japanese asks . " The world is changing . China has changed . We must , too . " " Do n't think we have n't counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government . " We know that it would mean an unlimited world nuclear arms race . But what is the alternative ? If the Geneva ' disarmament talks fail , if India , for instance , should start to build a bomb , we could not ' stay out . " An American diplomat notes // that the Japanese did not react like this when the Soviet Union first produced nuclear weapons in 1949 . " China frightens them , " he said . " Russia did n't . They felt that the umbrella of United States power protected them . But there is something different in their reaction to China . Now they see China well on the way to nuclear armament . This has shaken them . " World Role Sought But , as another foreigner said , it is not only fear that motivates Japan . " For years Japan has suffered from an inferiority complex , " he said . " This goes back to her 19th century effort to emulate the West . Now , for the first time , some Japanese are beginning to perceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have caught up in industry , in technology , in standard of living . And some are beginning to add up what this means in terms of world power . " What it means is that while Japan has one-seventh of China 's population , she has an industrial production substantially larger than China 's and growing at a rate that by 1970 probably will make her the third industrial country in the world , behind the United . States and the Soviet Union . She already holds the third position in the key categories of steel and electric power capacity . But without military power , and especially without nuclear military power , can Japan play the role that her position would justify and can she maintain the position without nuclear weapons ? These are the questions that thoughtful Japanese are struggling to resolve . They recognize that their decision may have awesome consequences . Space Program a Factor There are no technological barriers to Japanese construction of nuclear weapons . Japan is far advanced in peaceful nuclear technology for ship propulsion and power generation . Unlike other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of delivery systems through her space research and satellite program . The Japanese believe that they have more sophistication in the space and missile field than any power except the United States and the Soviet Union .. If the decision is made to produce nuclear weapons , a ready-made system for their delivery will be at hand . " We thought we could hold back popular sentiment for nuclear arms by getting ahead in the space race , " a Japanese military analyst said . " It may not work out exactly as some of us expected . " A. Fascination for China The Japanese are gripped by a curious fascination for China , a combination of attraction and repulsion , of guilt for the long war and atrocities inflicted on the Chinese and of nostalgia for China , born , in part , of roots in Chinese culture and , in part , in long years of residence during the Japanese occupation . Many Japanese , particularly the older generation of military men and civil servants , feel that they have a special understanding of China and that Japan can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misunderstanding Western world . Do the Japanese fear China ? Ambassador Edwin 0 . Reischauer of the United States thinks not . Other diplomats disagree . They feel that the Japanese fear China because of her size , her mass of population , her seemingly aggressive national characteristics . " Two things have shaken the Japanese , " an American diplomat said . " First , the latest Chinese nuclear test . This really hit home . And now the crisis in Peking . It has been so savage and so many of the individuals are those well known here in Japan . " A Japanese said : ' Perhaps , we are not afraid-of China . But she has made us stop and think . " 9 Newsmen in . Peking More Japanese visit China than do nationals of any other country . Last year 4,400 Japanese went to China compared with 400 Chinese visitors to Japan . The Japanese are tourists , businessmen , members of cultural groups , quasi-government representatives and sympathizers . Agitation for diplomatic ties between Japan and the Peking Government ebbs and flows . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsmen in China , more than represent any other country , and the Japanese press publishes more news of China than appears anywhere else abroad . Japan has become China 's principal trading partner . This year the volume of ChineseJapanese trade will cross the $500-million mark , doubling the 1964 figure . In part this reflects China 's trade shift to non-Communist countries because of the rift with Moscow . But in part , it is a reversion to traditional patterns of Japanese-Chinese trade . Last year Japan sold China $70-million worth of fertilizer , $45-million worth of machinery and $45-million worth of steel products . The Japanese bought in return $45-million in soybean products , $26-million worth of rice and $24-million worth of pig iron . The Japanese are sensitive about charges they are overexpanding trade with China . They note that West German trade with China grew by 97 per cent last year , that of Britain by 29 per cent and Italy by 129 per cent . The Japanese doubt that trade with China will expand indefinitely . It is limited , they feel , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deferred credit Japan is willing to allot . Purge Halts Trading Currently trade is impeded by Peking 's ideological crisis . Japanese businessmen returning from China report that it is almost impossible to do business there . " They are rushing from meeting to meeting , " a Japanese said . " They are spending so much time absorbing the ' thought of Chairman Mao ' that they have no time to talk trade or sign contracts , Literally , they seem to have only about an hour a day to put in at their desks . " Informal briefings that had been given once a month to Japanese correspondents by a Chinese trade official have been discontinued because of the pressure of ideological meetings . The Soviet Union has not been standing by idly while Chinese ties with Japan strengthened . Soviet trade with Japan reached $400-million last year . It will be bigger this year . The Russians are dangling a tempting morsel in front of the Japanese . They are offering the . Japanese a role in the development of Eastern Siberia and the Maritime Province . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical right . One of the most tempting Russian offers is a cooperative deal on a gas pipeline from new Sakhalin fields . The gas would be moved by pipeline and special compressor ship to fuel Japanese industries . The Japanese would put up the capital , build the facilities and the two countries would share the profit . The Russians have another proposal . They would like the Japanese to build an oil pipeline to supply Eastern Siberian industrial centers , This , too , would be cooperative . They have similar projects for the construction of steel mills , cement plants and chemical establishment . The dollar capital involved in these undertakings is difficult to calculate . But it would , the Japanese believe , run into billions . Japanese industry , always aggressive in seeking new outlets , is strongly tempted . Already more than 400 Japanese ships a year are docking at the Soviet Union 's new Pacific harbor of Nakhodka . They are handling an increasingly large share of Soviet Siberian trade . Soviet offers for cooperative economic development are the first such major effort by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Economic Policy sought to attract foreign capital on the basis of concessions and special contracts . The Russians say they are determined to speed the development of Eastern Siberia and are willing to give the Japanese good profits for a share in this undertaking . The fact that this will simultaneously orient Japan toward Moscow rather than toward Peking is not concealed . The Russians make no secret of their antagonism toward the Chinese .
