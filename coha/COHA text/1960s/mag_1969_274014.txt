" I 'm very old-fashioned , " admits Los Angeles ' Richard Diebenkorn . " Though I 'm interested in most of the new art , painting remains for me a very physical thing , an involvement with a tangible feeling of sensation . " In that , Manhattan 's Robert Natkin would concur . " The giant cool that is part of today 's life-style repulses me , " he says . " The artist has to have vulnerability , open up his feelings , and find a loving commitment . " Though Diebenkorn and Natkin belong to no school and live and work on opposite sides of the continent , their similar approaches to painting have brought them both to a kind of stylistic halfway house between representationalism on the one hand and formal geometry on the other . Both are romantic abstractionists who have preserved on canvas a sense of place and object without the aid of recognizable images . <P> Damp Light .

Then , in 1955 , he found himself in something of a bind , as he describes it , bored with splashing color around with the total freedom that abstraction allows .

" <P> Somewhat surprised that he does not even sketch from life any longer , Diebenkorn is still searching in his painting for that perfect balance of freedom and license . He explains , " Somehow , if you can put a shape , a space , a color anywhere , that 's not good . And yet if it has to go just here so specifically because of things like gravity and time of day and source of light , that gets to be a drag , too . " <P> Gingham Checks .
