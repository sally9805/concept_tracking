Three years ago Georgia stood at the 1 crossroads . A Federal court had ordered the Atlanta schools to integrate , and throughout the state there WaS deep resentment , with much inflammatory talk about massive resistance , school closings , violence if necessary . During the preceding 20 years Georgia had piled up a striking record of progress and modernization . Industry had surged in from the North , jobs had multiplied , average family income had risen sharply , people were living better . Education was Improving , and the illiteracy rate was dropping . Atlanta had become a gem among cities , and most of the large towns were booming mightily . And yet in the winter of 1960 there was an air of apprehension in the state . Everyone knew that the Atlanta court order was only the beginning , and , with the threat of social strife hanging there like a storm cloud , cooler heads wondered whether Georgia 's line , straight march ahead VV:IS to he halted in its tracks . Would Atlanta be another Little Rock ? Would there be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the public schools had been closed down tight  --  and remain closed to this day ? Already there were signs that industry , which likes to operate in an atmosphere of peace and order , was beginning to look askance at Georgia . Several national companies had reported difficulty in persuading their branch-plant executives , particularly those with children , to move into the state , The fact that in the end Georgia faced up to its problem and refused to turn back to the nineteenth century is one of the remarkable and encouraging events of our time . Today the state is moving forward at an even more rapid pace  --  in industrialization , in education , on the racial front , and politically . Lust summer it threw out itt ancient cOuntv-unit voting system , which had long gisen the balance of power to the rural backwaters  --  and to the Gene Talmadges they produced . By its example Georgia may very well point the way ahead to sonic of the other states in the Deep South . Georgia 's new attitude is typified perfectly by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I asked him to define " a moderate . " " In my case , " he replied , " ' moderate ' means that I am a segregationist but not a damned fool . " Then he added : " 1 am a southerner by birth and at heart , and I believe sincerely in our traditional separation of the races . On the other hand , l any for progress . am determined that during my administration this state will move ahead  --  fast . And 1 know that we cant have real progress in the midst of social upheavals . Consequently while 1 am governor we are going to obey the laws , we are not going to resist Federal court orders with violence , and we are not going to close any schools . We have seen some pretty sorry examples of that kind of folly in the South , and 1 want none of it in Georgia . " Sanders , a 37-year-old Augusta attorney , was elected governor last autumn after trouncing Marvin S. Griffin in the September Democratic primary , A slim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanders was a B-17 bomber pilot at age 19 in World War II . He holds a law degree from the University of Georgia , conducts a successful practice in Augusta and has served in both houses of the state legislature . " A segregationist , but " in Georgia the governor serves one four-year term , and although he can not succeed himself he can run for the same office again after standing aside for one or more terms . Griffin , Sanders ' opponent in the primary , had occupied the governor 's chair from 1955 to 1959 , and his administration was riddled with financial scandals . His attempted comeback in 1962 raised the old ghost of corruption in the State House , and Sanders pounded hard on the issue of clean government . He also hammered away on his favorite theme of progress . The state had pushed forward rapidly under Gov . S. Ernest Vandiver , whose term was drawing to a close , and Sanders insisted that nothing must check this march to better things . And of course the race problem was an issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people thought . Griffin is a forthright segregationist , as undiluted as high-proof bourbon . Sanders made it clear that he is " a segregationist but  --  " " This ' segregationist but credo , " said Ralph McGill , famed columnist and publisher of the Atlanta Constitution , " is a dichotomy that often crops up in the statements of the nets breed of southern politician . And that little word ' bull and what follows can be charged with future meaning for the South . " Many of the political soothsayers gave Griffin the edge in the primary . What they overlooked was that Georgia had indeed turned a corner . Most of the voters still wish the old racial status quo could remain , and they deeply resent what they regard as northern interference in their affairs . Yet , almost suddenly , the economic motive has become more important to the majority of Georgians than the perennial battle over Negro rights . Sanders sensed this , and he won . He was unopposed in the November election . In Georgia , perhaps more clearly than in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked eye the almost convulsive changes which are occurring in this nation 's way of life . The revolution in agriculture , the exodus from the land , the urbanization of the people , the industrialization of our economy , the rising standard of living for the rank and Me  --  all these trends are proceeding at an accelerated pace in Georgia . Georgia is a big , sprawling state , endowed with great natural beauty in many of its areas but ugly and neglected in others . From the mountains of the north  --  an extension of the Great Smokies  --  the terrain slopes away through rolling farm country and lovely wooded hills to the broad croplands and lush pastures of the southern coastal plain . Deep , slow streams , some of them navigable in their lower reaches , flow southward to the Gulf and east to the Atlantic Ocean . Georgia 's climate is benign , good hunting and fishing abound , and the outdoor life can be enjoyed most of the year . From the time of the Civil War until the 1930 's Georgia was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy was based on cotton ; a half century ago its compresses turned out 2,000,000 bales a year . With the exception of some tobacco , there was little other commercial farming worthy of the name . Textiles were the only industry of any consequence . Forty-acre , one-mule farms , eroding and declining in fertility , were the order of the day . On the larger places the ancient sharecropping system still had its stranglehold on the land . Forestry was a hit-and-run business , with the little peckerwood sawmills stripping the countryside and leas ing desolation behind . Fifty years ago two thirds of the population lived on the land , and most of the rural people of both races were bone-poor . Del and sanitation were bad , and the health quotient was low . Schools were poor , and the roads for the most part were mere gashes in the red earth . The courthouse gangs ruled the political roost and all too frequently remained in power through appeals to ignorance and bias and hatred . " Do n't talk to me about the good old days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I lived in those times , and they were n't good at all  --  for most folks . " Then came the day when Georgia 's one-crop economy began its precipitous decline . Cotton fell upon evil days in the Southeast and moved west . Hundreds of thousands of people knew no other way of farming , no other way of life . The flight from the land began . Abandoned cotton fields grew up to weeds , and little frame dwellings along the rural roads stood vacant and sagging  --  melancholy symbols of an era that was gone . Even as late as 1940 there were still 1,500,000 people living on Georgia farms . Today all but 400,000 ? one tenth of the state 's population  --  have fled to the towns and cities , and many of those who remain on farms earn most of their livelihood in the factories of nearby towns . Of Georgia 's approximately 100,000 fames , moreover , 65 percent are listed as part-time farming operations . And yet the slate 's agricultural income has leaped from 5150,000,000 in 1940 to almost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of diversification , hybridization , better fertilization , mechantzation  --  m short , more and better cash crops produced more efficiently  --  finally began to take hold . Cotton and tobacco are still grown in Georgia , but they are now only two of many cash crops . Peanuts , hybrid corn , hogs , cattle , dairy products , truck crops , pecans , peaches run into important money . Big business in birds The mast spectacular success story of all is poultry . Georgia tops the nation in chicken production , having showed a hundredfold increase since 1940 . Gainesville , a lively town in the foothills of the north Georgia mountains , claims to he . and probably is , the broiler capital of the world . 115 packing plants process around 230,000,000 broilers a year , turning out everything from the whole bird to quick-frozen chicken pie . Chickens and eggs together yielded an income of $242,208,000 for the state as a whole in 1961 ? close to one third of the total farm take . Gradually Georgia 's idle croplands are being returned to grass  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast-growing pine trees , which have become one of the big-money crops . Farmers are being taught scientific forestry for perpetual yield , and today many a farm realizes more money from its timber than it garnered from cotton in the old days . One of the finest examples of regrassing and retimbering I have ever seen is the ranch of David S. Wainer near Valdosta in south Georgia . In 1939 Wainer began assembling worn-out farms and devastated woodlands and now has a ranch of 2,381 acres . He built 83,000 feet of terraces to stop erosion , covered the depleted land with fast-spreading grasses , and set out 600,000 trees . Today the Wainer ranch is a beautiful piece of countryside . More than 300 polled Hereford cattle roam the pastures , 200 acres are in corn and tobacco , and the woodlands are ready to begin harvesting on a perpetual basis . Wainer expects his experiment to start yielding a substantial profit in 1963 , " Many authorities predict , " he said to mc , " that this southeastern coastal plain sonic day will he the Lop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural revolution is by no means at an cod in Georgia . The consolidation of small farms into larger holdings goes on apace . People are still leaving thefarms in droves for city jobs . But there are still many small , submarginal farms in Georgia . Rural poverty , and the ignorance that always attends it . still exist in sonic of the little backwaters . The poor whites , or rednecks , as they are often called in Georgia , are still there , although in much smaller numbers . All but 10 percent of the Negroes have gone to the cities along with the white folks . Meantime , coincident with the revolution in farming , manufacturing came to the towns and cities . attended by a vast upsurge in wholesaling and general business . Today Georgia makes hundreds of products for all manner of human needs , from furniture and fertilizers to ballpoint pens and brassieres . The value of Georgia 's manufactured products in 1939 stood at 5677,000,000 , and by 1960 the figure had risen to 55,756,000,000 . In one brief generation the state had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an increasing pace . While all this was occurring on the economic and sociological front . Georgia clung to its traditional ways politically and in racial matters . Then , three years ago , things began to happen . The turning point , many leading Georgians will tell you , came early in that apprehensive year of 1960 with hearings on integration of public schools . In the midst of the uproar which followed the Atlanta integration order , the legislature  --  it is called the General Assembly in Georgia  --  decided to set up a commission and sound out public opinion at the grass roots . John A. Sibley , attorney and banker , regarded by many as Atlanta 's most distinguished citizen , was persuaded to head the commission , a thankless job which invited brickbats from AL directions . Sibley was 72 at the time and entitled , perhaps , to the serenity of advancing years , but he took on the task with quiet aplomb . " I did it because 1 felt it should be done , " he said to me simply when l @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with a smile , " We can cope with our problems down here when we go about it intelligently . Incidentally , I am told that the North now has almost as many Negroes as we do in the South . You people have your ways , and we have ours , and I often wonder whether you handle the situation any better than we do . " Sibley and his commission held hearings in Georgia 's 10 congressional districts and listened to the firebrands and the calm citizens with patience , humor , and good sense . In the end the commission turned in a report which rocked the state . The net of the Findings was that , conic what might , most people did not want their schools closed . Nor did they want violence . A sharp minority report took issue with Sibley 's conclusions , however , and again some of the politicians began to yell bloody murder . " This is always the pattern , " said Eugene Patterson , able young editor of the historic Atlanta Constitution . " The politicians stir up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would quit yapping and show sonic restraint , we southerners could handle , with peace and order . the inevitable changes that are coming . Most folks nowadays simply do n't want this kind of trouble . " The first school integration in Georgia came , not in Atlanta , but at the University of Georgia , in Athens , during the winter of 1961 , An embryonic riot , which might have grown into a holocaust as damaging as the recent affair in Mississippi , was squelched by state troopers before it got out of control . In the fall of 1961 the Atlanta public schools were integrated without incident , and much of the credit goes to Mayor William B. Hartsfield , now retired , who mounted a campaign 0 ; citizen education . Week after week Bill Hartsfield answered the yammering of the politicians with the clear voice of reason By the autumn of 1962 about 40 Negro children were attending previously all-white schools in Atlanta . Thus far this is the only public-school integration in the state . At a higher level , Georgia Tech , Emory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now been integrated peacefully , and Agnes Scott College , an old and aristocratic girls ' school in nearby Decatur. has announced that it will accept colored students next fall . Public transportation and various other public facilities are now integrated in Atlanta and in some other Georgia towns . The city 's baseball team , the Atlanta Crackers , which won the Little World Series in 1962 , has both white and colored players . In some of the factories of Atlanta and other industrial ! owns I saw Negroes and whites working side by side and in some cases using the same washrooms and eating facilities . Here and there I saw Negro foremen supervising white workers . In Atlanta , which has more good eating places than most northern cities of equal or larger size , Negroes now dine at several of the better restaurants without causing even a ripple of interest among the white patrons . Many Georgia Negroes own and operate prosperous businesses , and on the southwestern outskirts of Atlanta 1 saw a large district of handsome Negro homes in the $30,000 to $50,000 class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of Georgia , just as they are in northern cities . Two months ago , in fact , race relations in Atlanta ran , quite literally , into a roadblock . To thwart  --  at least symbolically  --  the efforts of some real-estate men to move Negroes into a white residential section , the city 's Board of Aldermen on December 17 ordered barricades erected on two streets running between Negro and white residential areas . Sixteen city streets had been quietly desegregated during the preceding year , but now an issue was created , and the two-foot , 10-inchhigh barriers have become known as " Atlanta 's Berlin Wall . " As this is written a suit by the Negro All-Citizens Committee to have the " wall " removed is pending in court . Moderates hope the matter will not spark a reversal in Atlanta 's  --  and the state 's  --  generally impressive record in bettering race relations . In all Georgia cities and many of the smaller places Negroes now vote as a matter of course . A young Negro attorney , LeRoy Johnson  --  a Democrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlanta districts in November . His Republican opponent was a Negro . It is the first time the color line has been broken in the General Assembly since 1907 . In Albany , where there were disturbances last year when Negro leaders attempted to effect the integration of public facilities , I talked with Mayor Asa D. Kelley Jr . Mayor Kelley , an attorney , is a restrained and moderate man , troubled and perhaps a bit resentful that his town was chosen as a target for the seething new forces at work in the South . " When the Negroes came to me with their plan , " he said , " I advised them to wait for a court order . They refused and went ahead , and we enforced our long-standing city ordinances against such demonstrations . Nov the matter is in the courts , and if and when the order conies down to integrate well do our best to conform . " Last summer two Negro churches were burned in southwest Georgia by roughnecks out for some excitement , In the rural counties of southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75 percent  --  it is about 29 percent in the state as a whole  --  segregation is still flint-hard and will be for a long time to come . Doubtless there will be unhappy incidents from time to time in Georgia , hut , by and large , the state is learning to play by the new rules with peace and order . Lately numerous political leaders have begun to soft-pedal their statements . Perhaps the foremost architect of this changing attitude is Ralph McGill , who was the editor of the Consritation for many years before he became publisher . Short of stature but a towering figure journalistically , McGill writes an eloquent and courageous front-page column , which is also syndicated throughout the nation . Although a southerner , McGill is no " segregationist , but ? " . He believes passionately in the cause of Negro rights , and he wages the battle hard day after day . Asa result he is both loved and hated throughout the state and the South . He and his wife , who died last spring , and his son have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was blown up with a small bomb , and one night a shot tired from the street blasted through a window of his home . When Carl Sanders won his race for the governorship in September , the Augusta Courier , a little weekly newspaper published by a shrill racist named Roy V. Harris , headlined the result with a streamer in red ink : McGiLe 's RACE NIISING PHILOSOPHY WON SWEEPING Wean ' SEPT. 12. m . On an inside page was a cartoon showing the sun rising over the Georgia landscape , and on the sun 's disk was a sinister caricature of Ralph Mc-Gill 's face . McGill regards this attack as a delightful tribute and has a framed copy of the paper hanging on the wall of his office . " I 'm going to will it to my son , " he said to me , laughing . Muscle for city voters This has been a year of decision in Georgia in more ways than one . In the spring of 1962 the United States Supreme Court handed down its momentous decision which in effect said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the states to give our exploding urban areas an equitable ratio of political power . In many states , citizens moved immediately to implement the decision through localized court action , It was one such suit that brought the old county-unit voting system tumbling down in Georgia and gave genuine franchise to the cities , The State Senate was quickly reapportioned , and reapportionment of the House probably will follow . Equally important , candidates for state offices and Congress could now win or lose by the actual will of the people . solely on the basis of the popular vote . Politicians of the new young breed threw their hats in the air and scrambled to get into various races . Charles L. Weltner , a 34-year-old Atlanta attorney  --  a cool customer and a and licked Congressman James C. Davis , an old-guard Democrat who had served eight terms -- and who would have won again under the county-unit system . Ironically , Carl Sanders , who had delayed his decision to run for governor until it was obvious that the old system was on its way out , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the impetus for change in Georgia has come from Atlanta , and , as everyone who lives there will tell you , it is a fabulous city . The population of the five-county metropolitan area has leaped 40 percent in the past dozen years and now stands at well over a million . The city 's better residential areas are as beautiful as any 1 have ever seen , and in the midtown area many handsome new office buildings produce an impressive skyline , Subdivisions , dotted with gigantic new shopping centers , push out and out . Atlanta has long been the largest wholesaling and distribution center of the Southeast , and it has now become the leading manufacturing city of that area , with about 1,800 industrial plants in the metropolitan area . The city was lucky in the fact that much of its industrial growth came late  --  after the planners had learned that everything does n't have to he in the middle of town . Atlanta now has 25 pockets of industrial plants on the outskirts of the city proper , and a good many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beflowered . Much of the city 's manufacturing is " clean industry , " and there are few smokestacks . Atlanta is also a city hell-bent for culture  --  perhaps more so than any other city in the South , It has its own symphony of professional quality , a host of other musical activities , numerous art groups and museums and firm plans to create a full-fledged art school . The Metropolitan Opera comes to Atlanta for a week each spring , Broadway shows hit Atlanta regularly , and little-theater groups are active . The city is also a center of higher education , with the previously-named institutions , a wide variety of trade schools , and a complex of Five outstanding Negro colleges . If it was once true that Atlanta was an island of progress in a backward state , this is no longer so . Every town I visited had at least one spanking new public-school building  --  usually huge and ultramodern . Much emphasis is now being placed on more and better vocational education , to teach the skills that all this new industry demands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Macon , Athens , Gainesville , Columbus , Albany , Valdosta , Waycross and others are showing a lot of foot  --  with new industry flooding in . Savannah , an old seacoast city steeped in southern traditions , has improved its port facilities and is getting some new industry , but it is not pushing ahead as fast as Atlanta . Many private firms in the cities are trying hard to see that industry is spread evenly over the state . Among the most effective of these are the railroads and the Georgia Power Company . Another is the Citizens and Southern National Bank , which has 52 branches in the state . Mills Lane , a volatile citizen who sometimes wears colorful sport shirts to the office , heads this sprawling financial empire and takes the long view that the stale as a whole must move forward as a piece . He has a hard-hitting industrial department that has helped bring scores of new plants to many Georgia towns . Despite all this I suspect that many of the little rural villages are fated to dry up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is concerned . Already the business streets of a lot of them present a dreary spectacle indeed , with half the stores and shops boarded up . Many of the people who live in these crossroads places now drive from 10 to 40 miles over Georgia 's good highways to factory jobs in other towns  --  and do their buying in the larger places where they work . Georgians want to learn Georgia 's factory labor , at least a dozen plant managers said , is highly productive . Several said their man-hour production was better than in their companies ' northern plants . Although most of the workers are relatively unskilled when recruited , I heard much testimony about how easy they are to train . " These people want to learn , " said W. A. Pulver , president of Lockheed-Georgia , which , with 15,000 workers in its vast plant at Marietta , is the largest private industrial employer in the Southeast . Lockheed makes military cargo airplanes at its Georgia plant , and also plush little jet-powered private planes priced at $1,400,000 . Unions have not made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally speaking , are less militant . The Georgia Factory worker fresh off the farm is apt to be an independent character , who is usually proud of his job and his company . Georgia has one of those controversial Right-to-Work laws , which in effect says that a man does n't have to join a union to hold his job , and employers from the North like this too . In many plants , although by no means all of them , white labor is preferred , and the Negro still gets the short end of the stick  --  precisely as in the North . A notable exception is Script ? , an old Atlanta firm which makes mechanical pencils , ballpoint pens and cigarette lighters by the millions . When I visited Scripto recently , it had 1,320 employees , and 950 were Negroes , 850 of them Negro women . " Negro women do better on our type of assembly line than most white workers , " said James V. Carmichael , president of the firm , " This is no sociological experiment with us . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood at ? 4,208 in 1960 , well below the national average of $5,660 but far above Mississippi 's $2,884 . As in most southern states , the general level of education also falls below the national average , and the illiteracy rale is higher . Georgia still needs more jobs , and it needs to keep more of its talented young people at home instead of sending them north . In fact , the state still has some distance to go on several fronts . But it is catching up . Georgia has turned the corner .
