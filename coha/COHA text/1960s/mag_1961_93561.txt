It was just one ball game , played on an ordinary sunny September afternoon before a crowd of 28,635 in San Francisco last Saturday . But when it was over it may have cost the Los Angeles Dodgers a pennant and rendered useless an entire season of the most complete statistical study , strategy and platooning that baseball has ever known . // The Dodgers had arrived in San Francisco virtually tied with the Cincinnati Reds for the league lead . Actually they were in a better position than the Reds , for they had lost two less games . Besides they were hot , having won four straight from the Giants in Los Angeles . So when they lost Friday night in San Francisco while the Reds were beating the Cardinals , the Dodgers casually felt they had been due for a defeat . Now they were two games behind the Reds , but they had still lost one less game . // On the bus trip to Candlestick Park next day , the Dodgers were cheerful . Sitting in the front seat , Manager Alston discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Dodger manager . He has been under pressure to win the pennant with what most people consider the best team in the league . And he has been constantly criticized for his method of managing that team ; his involved platooning system and his constant reference to the statistical findings of Allan Roth , the Dodger number man who keeps the most detailed performance records in the game . // The Alston method has led , for example , to this year 's Dodgers having two players ( Tom Davis and Ron Fairly ) who have played four positions , four outfielders who have each played left , center and right , and four men who have played first base . // " But it 's the kind of team it is , not Alston , that has forced the platooning , " says Roth . " People forget that when Walter managed Reese , Robinson , Campanela , Snider and Hodges , he did n't platoon . " // Alston himself was well aware of the danger of platooning : that constant substitution and shifting of position erodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent and no stars , he felt he had to take the risk  --  and Saturday showed how serious these risks can be . // " The Giants are throwing Marichal , a right-hander , so I 'm going with my left-handed hitters , " said Alston as the bus ride began . " That 's Roseboro catching , Ron Fairly at first and Snider in center . // " There 's only one real decision I had to make in picking today 's lineup , " he went on , " and that was third base . I could play Tommy Davis , but that hurts us on defense and Davis has n't been hitting . I could play Charlie Neal at second and move Junior Gilliam to third , or I could play Daryl Spencer , though he has a bad leg . I 've decided on Spencer because he 's been hitting pretty good . " // A half hour later the Dodgers were in the locker room dressing . Alston read the starting lineup aloud . // Afterward , young Tommy Davis , who had been out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alston . " May I see the lineup card ? " he asked softly . // Alston reached into his locker and handed it to him without a word . Davis read it impassively , returned it and walked quietly to his corner of the room . // " How did I feel when I saw I was n't playing ? " Davis said in response to a question . " I 'm a human being , just like anyone else , but he 's got to use his nine best men . " // Davis has sometimes been called on to play as many as three different positions in three innings . " I 've never played much third base , " Davis said . " I have trouble with slow grounders and I aim my throws too much . " // " When Tommy 's hitting well he has to play , " said Alston . " But what outfielder does he replace ? Snider ? Moon ? Howard ? So he has to play third . " // An hour later the game began . The scoreboard showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily against Marichal in the first inning . Then , with Don Drysdale pitching , Joe Amalfitano of the Giants hit a wicked hopper toward Fairly down at first base . Fairly bobbled it , booted it but managed to pick it up just in time for the out . // " I really had n't played much first base before this year , " Fairly had said the night before . " I still make a lot of mistakes , like when to hold the runner on . The outfield is my position and I feel more sure of myself there . " // " He 's learning , " said patient Walter Alston . " He had his first bad game at first base the other night . But he 's hitting well and he 'll do all right . " // Advice from a foe // With two out in the first , Willie Mays got up . The night before , during batting practice , he and Drysdale had been kidding each other . " I hope you do hit me , " said Willie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " // " You 're backingaway , " said Drysdale , " and swinging at bad pitches . " // " Darn right I 'm backing away from the plate when you pitch , " Mays said . " I just want to swing at that first pitch and get out of there . When you pitch ? " // " Saturday , " said Drysdale. // " Well , let 's talk about it Sunday , " said Willie . // Now , batting against Drysdale , Mays stepped backwards and hit an inside pitch to third for an easy out . // With two out in the Dodger second , Roseboro hit a home run for a 1-0 Dodger lead . " It 's always easier to hit when you 're playing regularly , " Roseboro had said earlier . " When Alston sends me up to pinch-hit , I just feel he knows I have n't been playing and understands I might do extra bad . So if I do , the hell with it . " // Spencer struck out to end the inning . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had let out a mock whistle . " That makes three games in a row , a record , " he said . " It 's rough sitting on the bench . On most teams if you have a bad day , you can come back the next . With this club , you have a bad day , you might be out a week . But Walter 's got a tough problem with so many good men . " // In the Giant second , Willie McCovey hit a home run to tie the score . Orlando Cepeda tripled and scored on a fly ball . The Giants scored twice more in the third , Cepeda hitting a single to right with two out and the bases loaded . Frank Howard bobbled the ball for an error . The night before he had bobbled another ball , letting a run score . Howard this year has played right field , left field and first base . // The Dodgers came to bat in the sixth inning , still losing 4-1 . Billy O'Dell had replaced Marichal , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Snider singled for a run . That brought up Fairly . // " It might have seemed sensible to bring in Hodges , " explained Alston later . " Gil hits right-handed and gives us better defense at first . But Fairly had singled off O'Dell the first time he faced him and that wind was beginning to blow pretty good toward right . The wind is a big factor , just as the screen is at the Coliseum . In Chicago , there 's always a wind , too . If it 's blowing out , I play my big hitters . If it 's blowing in , I play my defensive team . Depending on the pitcher , of course . " // So now there came the kind of play that makes all thinking managers wonder if they do n't torment themselves needlessly . Fairly drove a ground ball at McCovey near first base . It was a perfect double-play ball , but McCovey never touched it . The ball zipped neatly through his legs and into the right-field corner . Both runners scored , Fairly went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard then hit a sacrifice fly , and the Dodgers were ahead . // When the Dodgers still led by a run after they had hit in the seventh , Walter Alston began to shift to his defensive team . Neal went in to play second base and Gilliam moved to third . // " I do n't care which position I play , " Gilliam had said earlier . " I just play . " // Up in the press box , Cookie Lavagetto , the deposed manager of the Minnesota Twins , smiled when told this . " Do n't let them fool you , " he said . " Ballplayers hate to move around . " // As for Neal , he had twice within the month made crucial errors to lose games . " I think he 's sick , " one Los Angeles sportswriter said . " I mean it , I really think he 's not feeling well . " // Sitting in front of his locker before the game , Neal did look thin and nervous , with eyes like a frightened fawn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's hard to get loose . That 's what makes it tough . The mental strain ? No , I do n't think there 's any mental strain . " // Willie fooled Don // With one out and one on , in the Giant seventh , Willie Mays , having successfully conned Drysdale the night before , rammed a pitch far into the left-field seats . The Giants led again 6-5 . To make it worse , the scoreboard showed that Cincinnati had won in 12 innings . // Wally Moon brightened things for the Dodgers by hitting a home run in the eighth . Leo Durocher , coaching at third , nearly knocked him down with a pat on the back . But in the bottom of the eighth the Dodgers collapsed . // There was one out when Felipe Alou hit a ground ball just to Neal 's right . For an instant Neal stood there , frozen . Then he moved awkwardly , grabbed the ball and dropped it . Ernie Bowman then hit a fly ball to center . Snider drifted to his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifted too . Snider lunged for it , and missed . Alou scored and the Giants were ahead 7-6. // For Walter Alston , the next minutes must have seemed like a glimpse of hell . The Giant pitcher hit a ball to Maury Wills at short . The ball bounced off Wills 's shin for an error . The next batter grounded to the unfortunate Neal . Neal picked this ball up and flipped it to Wills . Wills dropped it for another error , the third of the inning , and the team 's fifth . When Willie Mays singled , making it 9-6 , it did n't take Allan Roth to know that the Dodgers ' number was up . // Dazed , the Dodgers went out quickly in the ninth . They dressed in silence , then got on the bus for the long ride back to their hotel . No one talked . Charlie Neal , sitting near the rear of the bus , gazed mournfully out the window at the hills of San Francisco . Walter Alston , sitting alone up front , stared blankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
