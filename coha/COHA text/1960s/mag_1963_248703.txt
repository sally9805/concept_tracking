Against a half-century of socialist dialectics , the profit motive still survives in Russia , in both honest and dishonest forms . Hardly a week goes by without another case of graft or " left-handed production " - the Russian nickname for clandestine manufacturing . Judging by three new scandals last week , the problem is getting worse . <P> &gt; In the Ukraine , the woman book keeper of a collective farm , Yulya Kutasevich , stood accused of embezzling $55,000 in collusion with the farm chair man and half a dozen other local officials . So well protected was the operation that even as Yulya went about her double-entry bookkeeping , she was singled out by regional commissars as the best collective-farm accountant in her district , sent on an expense-paid trip to Moscow . The swindle was discovered only after agents of the Department for the Struggle Against Embezzlement of Social Property dropped in for a routine inspection . Last week Yulya was sentenced to be shot , her male accomplices to long prison terms . <P> &gt; In Moscow , 25 plant executives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverting tons of their inventories . Most sensational was the confession of N. Medintziv , supervisor of Sporting Equipment Factory No. 2 , that he had turned his back , for thousands of rubles a month in payoffs , while the chief of his cutting-floor section routed consignments of leather to distant Georgia ( via the state railway ) . There it was secretly fashioned into fancy high-heeled shoes , which were smuggled back to Moscow - and snapped up by the Soviet capital 's increasingly style-conscious women . <P> &gt; In Odessa , the biggest of the trials involved one Comrade Kunyansky , chief engineer of the Defender of the Motherland knitted-goods factory . With two main accomplices , Kunyansky set up an undercover textile mill which , using government yarn , spun out 6,250 high-quality , snug-fitting women 's sweaters that sold for 30 to 40 rubles each to budding Ukrainian sweater girls . The operation netted $169,400 , was not discovered for seven months . Last week the three ringleaders were ordered to face a firing squad , and 23 of their employees were sent to prison .
