The drawing-room , terrace , and parts of adjoining rooms of the Paris home of Lily Dafon , her mother , grandmother , greatgrandmother , and greatgrandfather . It is morning . Peculiar-looking birds of various sizes and colors in three hanging cages sing complicated , comic , unreal melodies that might have been written by the most brilliant if eccentric composer of our time . Three big French poodles , their hair purposely untrimmed , their eyes hidden by heavy mats of it , stand around , listening , watching , trying to think , trying to put two and two together . FIRST DOG ( to the Birds ) You lie , you liars ! ( to Second Dog ) Why do they lie ? SECOND DOG They do not lie , Father . They are glad . FIRST DOG Not mad ? Are you sure ? Are you glad , for instance , or mad ? SECOND DOG Glad ! Glad ! Glad ! FIRST DOG You say glad , but your saying itself is mad . THIRD DOG No , Papa 's glad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If your son is n't mad , he 's certainly stupid . Why ? Who is his mother ? p. 3 SECOND DOG The only woman I ever really loved . I ca n't remember her name . FIRST DOG Love 'll do that , I suppose , but of course there 's no telling , I sometimes wonder if we really understand anything , as we have always believed we do . Lily 's greatgrandmother , Rose , almost seventy but still essentially a pretty girl , comes into the room , using a cane and waving a copy of a newspaper . She notices Lily 's grandmother , Gladiola , reading a book , eating whole strawberries off a plate , drinking coffee , and smoking a cigarette , by turns . She bangs the floor with her cane . Lily 's grandmother turns , gets up , and goes to the old lady . GRANMOTHER Is the news as bad as all that , Mama ? You 've silenced the poor birds . Why ? GREATGRANDMOTHER One day I shall eat the poor birds , wait and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She presents her daughter with the paper , and watches her daughter examine the front page . GRANMOTHER And just what has Lily got to do with a meeting of diplomats in Geneva ? GREATGRANDMOTHER That 's not the only news on the front page . GRANMOTHER What is it , Mama ? p. 4 GREATGRANDMOTHER Will you please be good enough to look at that large photograph ? GRANMOTHER ( looks at photograph , then reads ) George Hannaberry of Dallas , Texas at Longchamp yesterday afternoon immediately after the seventh race in which he won twenty million francs on a horse named  --  Lily Dafon . Well , I think that 's very nice . GREATGRANDMOTHER And who is that standing beside this  --  whoever it is , from wherever it is , who won whatever it is ? Who is that ? GRANMOTHER ( looks again ) Whoever it is , she is n't exactly beside him . There are other people around . There always are at the races . GREATGRANDMOTHER ( with angry impatience ) Who is it , beside this man , or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Well , I must say she does look a little like Lily , at that . GREATGRANDMOTHER It is Lily . Why would a man from some far-away place wager a million francs on a horse named in honor of Lily Dafon if Lily Dafon herself were not with him ? GRANMOTHER To win of course , as he did . p. 5 GREATGRANDMOTHER Not at all . To please her . To let her know he is a daring , attractive , heedless , rich man . GRANMOTHER Have some coffee , Mama . We may be poor , but we 're not that poor . GREATGRANDMOTHER I 've had some , thank you , and we are that poor . GRANMOTHER Surely no poorer than we 've always been . GREATGRANDMOTHER If that were so , I 'd feel we were rich . GRANMOTHER Well , we certainly wo n't be put out into the street . GREATGRANDMOTHER Wo n't we , after more than a year of being unable to pay the rent , even ? And how long is it since any of us has bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to say ? GREATGRANDMOTHER You know perfectly well what I 'm trying to say . In fact , I 've said it . Lily is our last chance . GRANMOTHER Must you put it so crudely ? GREATGRANDMOTHER You left me no choice . Well , where is she ? GRANMOTHER In her room , of course . Only the old are sleepless. p. 6 GREATGRANDMOTHER Not Lily . I am not asking where Lily is ? Where is Lily 's mother , your daughter ? GRANMOTHER Well , I 'm sure she 's not far , Mama . We do all live here together . GREATGRANDMOTHER I mean , please find her , do n't I ? Is n't that what I mean ? GRANMOTHER Yes , I believe that is what you mean , Mama . The grandmother goes out . The greatgrandmother stands staring at the photograph in the newspaper . FIRST DOG Oh , boy . Here comes something . SECOND DOG How do you mean , Father ? GREATGRANDMOTHER Oh , shut up , please ! A bird begins to sing . The old lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops suddenly , leaving a whole concert in mid-air . Lily 's grandmother returns with Lily 's mother , and all three women are seen together for the first time . They make a very pretty picture . Silently the newspaper is passed from one woman to the other , after which they look at one another , first knowingly , and then unknowingly . MOTHER ( reads ) Mr. Hannaberry is said to be the richest man in the world , from cattle , oil , mining , and investments . Only two Maharajas may be richer and the Greek who  --  p. 7 GREATGRANDMOTHER It is n't necessary to read any more . He 's one of the richest men in the world . Is n't that enough to make you aware of the almost limitless implications and possibilities of this  --  thing ? MOTHER Lily herself is n't even mentioned in the story . GREATGRANDMOTHER Lily Dafon . It 's right there . ( to Lily 's mother ) Is n't that the name of your daughter ? ( to her daughter ) Is n't Lily Dafon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( to Lily 's mother ) Her father . Was he not Count Alphonse Dafon himself ? ( the grandmother and the mother look at one another ) Well , was he not ? GRANMOTHER Yes , Mama . But is n't it possible we are clutching at straws ? After all , the Lily Dafon in the newspaper is a horse . GREATGRANDMOTHER I know that . We 've all known for two years that a very pretty little filly was named Lily Dafon in honor of our Lily by Monsieur Jean-Paul Tabac . We 've all seen the horse , loved it , prayed for it , and lost good French money on it . I have the figures written down somewhere  --  money we had no right to lose . Five or six hundred thousand francs . p. 8 GRANMOTHER Oh , Mama . We 've never bet more than two hundred francs at a time . GREATGRANDMOTHER Will you please be good enough to just listen to me for a moment , and try to understand ? ( resuming her recitation ) Good French money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the richest men in the world has come to Paris . For what purpose ? To win money at the horse races ? I doubt that very much . And he , he alone in all of Paris , in all of France , most likely , has wagered money on Lily Dafon . Not a thousand francs , not ten thousand , not a hundred thousand , but a million . On a horse that has never before won a race , or come anywhere near winning . Why has he done this mad , brilliant thing ? Well , let me tell you why , because I know . From long experience in the ways of men I know . He did it because he 's in love . With our Lily Dafon ! GRANMOTHER Mama , there is perhaps something to what you say , of course . All the same it could be an accident , pure and simple . A harp played by Lily is heard softly . GREATGRANDMOTHER Of course . Love is always an accident , but Lily Dafon was taken to Longchamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting , the accident of their falling in love , happened long ago . p. 9 MOTHER Well , let 's call Lily and ask her . GREATGRANDMOTHER Will you please try to think ? Lily is a child , with all the pride and independence of a child . At the same time , she is also a woman , a woman among women , I 'm proud to say , and that which is hers alone is hers alone . We must think . We must plan . We must be prepared for any eventuality . Any . GRANMOTHER Including the eventuality that Lily simply does n't know the man ? GREATGRANDMOTHER If need be , yes , but there is no need for that . Look at that picture . That 's Lily . MOTHER Lily 's my daughter , and I think I would rather just ask her  --  before it 's too late . GREATGRANDMOTHER You may do so if you wish , of course , but please think a moment . Think deeply , and I believe you will decide to let Lily come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's seeing this man , if she 's going to the races with him , if he 's fallen in love with her , if she 's fallen in love with him , if they are about to become  --  ? Well , how long do you expect me to wait ? After all , Lily is engaged to marry George Murat-Dufour , her friend from childhood . Or at any rate , was . Lily stops playing the harp  --  suddenly , not at the end of a piece . p. 10 GREATGRANDMOTHER Caution , care and caution , please . She 'll be here in a moment . She opens the newspaper and leaves it on the table . She gestures that they must go into hiding , in order to spy on Lily when she finds the paper and notices the photograph and the story beside it . They go out . SECOND DOG If birds are mad , Father , and dogs are mad , as you say , what about people ? FIRST DOG Most of all . Did n't we learn everything we know from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know so much , to understand so deeply , and yet not be able to  --  make things right . SECOND DOG How can things be made right ? FIRST DOG How ? Let me think a moment . ( pause ) By stopping the coming of night  --  once and for all for ever , for everything . That 's how . Day ! and nothing glorious else . We know , we understand , and yet we ca n't do it . Tomorrow , who knows where I shall be , and still France will be France , and Lily Dafon will play the harp , and I wo n't be here . Ah , life . Who will see the trees when I 'm far away ? SECOND DOG Somebody , Father . THIRD DOG Somebody else . FIRST DOG Yes , and I hate the son of a bitch . The dogs wander off , or lie down , or hang around some more . The three women stand together just beyond a door . All is expectancy  --  a kind of daffy , patient , impatient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a change , a little of the unknown , the unexpected , the unknowable . There is a long hush , and then a Voice For a Bird is heard . p. 11 BIRD What 's all the silence for ? The end of the world ? What 's everybody holding his breath for ? Break it up , boys . We 're singers , not thinkers . Let 's go . One , two , go ! All of the birds break into their very best singing . Lily comes in , carrying a great white box full of flowers . She adds her voice to the bird-sounds in happy , improvised , or seemingly improvised , song , ad libbed , something like this:Day , day of light of love , dayI saw you yesterdayGreat green and gay , dayI saw you , saw you send awayThe slender sleeping daytime moonThe sun 's own little sisterI saw , and did n't care , dayBecause I myself was there , dayWhen all things kissed her . The three women listen to the strange scarcely audible words for some clue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers in a vase . They watch as Lily picks up the newspaper , sits down , and looks at it . Idly . They return to the room gradually , on tip-toe . Lily smiles at either the photograph in the paper , or the story with it , but there is no telling and no telling what the smile means . Suddenly , she moves her head to one side , as if she were trying to hear something better , or as if she might be aware that she is being watched . And then something in the newspaper seems to surprise her , or actually does . At any rate , she stands suddenly , and all three women disappear quickly beyond the door again . Lily examines the picture in the paper more carefully , and reads the whole story , as the three women sneak back . Finally , Lily speaks , very calmly . p. 12 DAFON Oh , Mama , Grandmama , Greatgrandmama ! Is n't it wonderful ? The three women gather around Lily , as if they had n't been caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful , Lily ? DAFON ( looks from face to face , as if to deliberately confuse and outwit them in a game ) Well , do n't you know ? GRANMOTHER Lily , so many things are always wonderful , it 's not easy to know which particular thing is meant by whichever one of us has brought up the matter . As you just have , thinking of something in the morning paper , perhaps ? DAFON Oh , no , Grandma . I never expect to find anything wonderful in the papers . MOTHER In this particular paper , Lily . In this particular issue of this particular paper . Now , Lily 's greatgrandfather , a slim dapper fellow in his early seventies , a dandy of another time , a boulevardier , comes in , and his wife tries to drive him off , but he sits down , lights a cigarette , and watches and listens . DAFON No , Mama . I 'm not thinking of anything in this particular issue of this particular paper , or anything in any other paper . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 MOTHER The flowers ? DAFON Yes , of course . Are n't they wonderful ? Was n't it simply doggy of George to send them ? FIRST DOG Doggy ? GREATGRANDMOTHER George ? GRANMOTHER George who ? MOTHER Yes , Lily . Which George ? DAFON Which George ? How many Georges are there ? GREATGRANDMOTHER Two , perhaps ? DAFON Oh , I suppose I 've met six or seven Georges . ( She reflects on this a moment ) .. At least . ( Another reflection ) More . Seventeen or eighteen , most likely . But how many Georges mean anything to me ? GRANMOTHER How many ? DAFON One , of course . The only one . MOTHER Yes , of course , Lily , but who is the only one ? DAFON I ca n't understand how you can ask such a question , Mama . As if you do n't know . MOTHER Well , I do n't . I 'm certainly not sure . I had no idea George Murat-Dufour could afford flowers of any kind , let alone such beautiful , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can afford them or not , he 's sent them . There 's the card . MOTHER ( examines the card , and then reads the message on the card ) " To Lily , the prettiest flower in the whole bouquet , with everlasting admiration , love , and thanks . George . " GRANMOTHER ( examines the card ) Is that George Murat-Dufour 's hand-writing ? GREATGRANDMOTHER ( examines the card ) It is not . Is it , Lily ? DAFON Well , if it is n't , somebody else named George has either made an awful mistake , or  --  let me look at the card again , please . ( she examines card ) Of course it is . His handwriting is never the same from one day to another , but there 's something about it I can always recognize  --  simplicity , like the handwriting of a small boy who wants to be sure every word he writes will be impossible to mistake for any other word . MOTHER Lily , where were you yesterday afternoon just after the seventh race at  --  GREATGRANDMOTHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lily , and the message with them is just as honest and simple as it can be . p. 15 MOTHER Please do n't interrupt , Grandmama . ( to Lily ) After the seventh race at Longchamp , Lily ? DAFON The seventh ? MOTHER Yes , the seventh . DAFON What time would that be ? MOTHER ( quickly blurting it out ) Lily , were you at Longchamp yesterday afternoon with a man named George Hollingwood ? DAFON Hannaberry . MOTHER How does it happen that you know his name so well ? DAFON I just read it in the paper . MOTHER Do you know this man ? Yes or no . DAFON No , Mama , I do n't know him . Why ? MOTHER Why ? We seem to feel  --  I seem to feel that the reason the man wagered so heavily , so unreasonably , so wildly , so brilliantly is that you were with him . And if that 's so , Lily , please be kind enough to say so . Is that the reason ? DAFON I have n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could I possibly guess ? Men are so mysterious . ( to all of them ) Surely you know that far better than I do , far better than I could ever hope to know . Perhaps the man 's a lunatic . A lucky lunatic . There are so many unlucky ones , especially at the race courses , I 'm also proud that a horse bearing my name has postponed this lunatic 's inevitable exposure and humiliation . p. 16 MOTHER Impossible . The man 's one of the richest men in the world . DAFON That may be the reason he wagered so much . Perhaps to him a great deal is very little . MOTHER Lily , why do I have this feeling you 're not telling the truth ? DAFON I do n't know , Mama . I do n't have that feeling . MOTHER I have this feeling that if you are n't actually lying , you are keeping the real truth to yourself . DAFON Does n't everybody ? Do n't you , Greatgrandma ? GREATGRANDMOTHER Indeed , I do , my dear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  what is the American word I want ? DAFON Blabbermouth ? GREATGRANDMOTHER Precisely . Unladylike , rude , and certainly boring to others . But there comes a time when the most ladylike lady confides in somebody . DAFON Of course . To the priest , if she feels she must become absolved of a sense of guilt . Or to the psychiatrist , if she feels incomplete , and I do n't at all . I am complete , except for a few unimportant little things everybody always longs for but never expects to get . p. 17 MOTHER What unimportant little things , Lily ? DAFON Money , jewels , clothes , automobiles , horses , carriages , a house in the country , a faithful staff . Is there a girl anywhere in the world , who does n't long for such things ? GRANMOTHER Unimportant ? Little ? DAFON Of course . Because they 're only longed for , and everybody is satisfied to let it go at that . GREATGRANDMOTHER Everybody ? DAFON Oh , sometimes a very pretty girl , a very charming girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very lucky girl , and she happens to meet a man who adores her , and it happens that she in turn adores him , and it happens that the man is very rich , and so the girl marries him , and then as a matter of course she has all of these unimportant , little things . GREATGRANDMOTHER Marries ? DAFON Oh , of course sometimes she does n't . She does n't want to , or he does n't , or he ca n't , and so they do n't . GREATGRANDMOTHER Well , what happens to the little , unimportant things then ? DAFON Sometimes she gets them anyway , sometimes she does n't . But what are we talking about ? All I said was the flowers are beautiful . p. 18 GREATGRANDMOTHER ( in a mock , tragic tone of voice ) The flowers will fade by morning . DAFON Of course . They 're flowers . We want them to fade . There are plenty more where they came from . Plenty more of everything where everything comes from . Flowers remind us of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may very well be a satisfying philosophy for a young girl , but let me tell you one thing , Lily . I 've tried very hard to believe , but I just have n't been able to believe one single word that you have left unspoken . GREATGRANDFATHER ( coming into the group suddenly ) What did she say ? What did my daughter say to my greatgranddaughter ? GREATGRANDMOTHER You keep out of this , please . It 's no concern of yours . GREATGRANDFATHER Did she say Lily 's a liar ? Because if she did , she 's mistaken . I wish Lily were a liar . This is a world of lies , and anybody unskilled in the art of the lie soon finds himself despised , rejected , avoided , ill and incoherent . GREATGRANDMOTHER Oh , shut up , please . GREATGRANDFATHER I know when a woman lies . I have especially cultivated that skill . A man must , or perish . And I tell you Lily is telling the truth . I know when a woman lies . p. 19 GREATGRANDMOTHER You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mysteriously , glances at her daughter 's daughter . The meaning of her smile and her glance is very nearly unmistakable : he has never known when a woman lies . GREATGRANDMOTHER I had no idea . GREATGRANDFATHER Precisely what do you mean by that tone of voice ? GREATGRANDMOTHER I mean I had no idea you understood women so well . GREATGRANDFATHER Well , you 're lying , and I know it , but keep it to yourself . It 's all right . For all I know you may even be thinking my own daughter is in fact not my daughter and therefore Lily is not my greatgranddaughter . It is always possible for women to create doubt in men on that account , a year later , or ten , or twenty , or two days this side of the grave . But nothing in the world can create the slightest doubt anywhere , in anybody , in anything , that while women are the only mothers of the human race , men are certainly the only fathers . My daughter is my daughter . GREATGRANDMOTHER Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's most artful language  --  silence , eyes , a smile . In reply , permit me to say there are surely daughters in other houses who are not mine except to their mothers , and to truth . That mother 's lie is better than the truth  --  deeper , more mysterious , and more true than truth itself . Only fools belittle the lie , and thereby our best hope for a usable truth some day . After all , our purest , surest truth so far is the drawing of breath , and breathing needs no other truth than air . p. 20 GREATGRANDMOTHER For some reason , all of a sudden you 're trying to say something . What is it ? Something not nearly as grand as you would like to pretend . At your age , can it be that  --  ? Oh , well , how right you are . Keep it to yourself . GREATGRANDFATHER I meant only to pass through this room on my way to the boulevard , but how could I go on , with a fierce battle raging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth ? Well , just remember this . Lily could n't lie if she wanted to . He embraces her quickly and goes out the front door . GREATGRANDMOTHER Oh , what a scoundrel ! All that talk about daughters in other houses  --  the very word stunned me , as he meant it to . No such thing at all . Pure fantasy . An old man 's pathetic pretending . All the same , we know it is a man 's world , Lily , and that 's why we do n't want you to make a foolish mistake . DAFON Well , I certainly hope my mistakes wo n't be too foolish , although so far most of them have been terribly embarrassing . MOTHER Lily , let 's get to the point . Is there any reason why you should n't marry George Murat-Dufour immediately ? The question annoys the greatgrandmother , but she remains silent . DAFON I do n't think so , Mama , except that he has n't asked me. p. 21 MOTHER Why not ? Is anything the matter with him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAFON Oh , no , Mama . MOTHER Then , why has n't he asked you ? It 's two years almost since you became officially engaged . Well , Lily , an engaged man generally does n't bring up the matter of the wedding ceremony only because his bride-to-be does n't encourage him . Why have n't you encouraged George ? DAFON Because I do n't know how , I suppose . MOTHER Oh , please do n't be so naive . Or sophisticated , or whatever it may be . DAFON George is a great architect , and like all great artists , he is hardly ever not preoccupied with his work  --  brilliant , daring , radical , but so far unsuccessful . He would really like to build Paris all over again , but when he gets a commission to re-design a bathroom his ideas make his clients forget the whole thing . They 're satisfied to have the old bathroom . He wants a bathroom to be a gymnasium , too , and a library , and an art gallery , and all sorts of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's because he 's offered commissions to re-design only bathrooms , and he 's bursting with ideas to re-design the whole world . p. 22 MOTHER Are you perhaps saying that George just ca n't afford to set a date at this time ? DAFON He certainly has n't very much money , although there is to be a small inheritance when he 's thirty . MOTHER Oh , that 's years away . DAFON Yes , it is . GREATGRANDMOTHER ( unable to remain silent any longer ) Very well , then . What about this other George ? DAFON Mr. Hannaberry ? GREATGRANDMOTHER Yes , of course . DAFON I do n't know the man . GREATGRANDMOTHER Oh , Lily , I know you must pretend not to know him  --  for reasons of your own , which I 'm sure are perfectly sensible reasons  --  and I respect that , but ca n't we speak together in a way that permits all of us to understand one another , no matter what we leave unsaid ? DAFON I 'm speaking the only way I know how . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives at the Plaza-Athenee , and won a lot of money he does n't need at Longchamp yesterday afternoon on a horse named Lily Dafon , which also happens to be my name , and by now I almost wish it weren't. p. 23 MOTHER How do you know he lives at the Plaza-Athenee ? DAFON The paper says so . GREATGRANDMOTHER Say what you like , leave unsaid what you like , I say you know this man , and I am an old woman , Lily . I remember vividly my own lies when I was your age , told to my own mother . You met this man perhaps a week ago , perhaps two weeks ago . I do n't know how it happened , but I know it happened . What 's more , he sent you these flowers , not George Murat-Dufour. ( she lifts the telephone receiver and begins to dial ) DAFON Who are you calling ? GREATGRANDMOTHER ( into telephone , with an especially skilled and sweet tone of voice , unlike her natural speaking voice ) George , my dear sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such beautiful flowers . ( listens a moment ) We 're simply thrilled , most of all Lily . Yes , dear George , thank you . ( a quaver comes into her voice ) Do please hurry over this evening after work , and have supper with us . Au revoir , dear boy , we adore you . ( she hangs up very slowly ) DAFON There ! And I hope you 're satisfied . p. 24 GREATGRANDMOTHER I do n't understand . He ca n't afford flowers . He 's never before sent any . ( lifts newspaper ) And who is the girl standing beside the man at Long-champ ? It 's you , Lily . Of course it 's you . I 'd recognize your back anywhere . Here , look again . DAFON Looking ca n't make it me . Nothing in the world can make it me . I was n't there . ( mocking ) Do please hurry over this evening after work and have supper with us . He hurries over three or four times a week , and everybody ignores him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So now you know the truth . Well , thank you very much , because if it 's all right , I 'd like to go window-shopping now . Lily is on her way out the door when the telephone bell rings . She turns quickly and rushes to the telephone , but her greatgrandmother is already there . GREATGRANDMOTHER Yes ? Yes , dear boy ( she listens a moment ) Are you sure ? ( listens ) No need to be embarrassed at all . It 's the thought that counts . I 'm sure you 've had the thought . It is n't as if we do n't know such gifts are much too expensive for a young man on the threshold of a great but difficult career . We love you just the same , dear boy . Au revoir. ( she hangs up even slower than last time , relishing this new development ) p. 25 MOTHER He did n't send the flowers ? GREATGRANDMOTHER He did n't . He said he was so confused by my call  --  his mind was on a tree he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize what I had said . DAFON A tree ? GREATGRANDMOTHER Yes , that 's what he said . MOTHER ( with determination and finality ) All right , Lily . Off we go . DAFON Do you really want to go window-shopping , Mama ? MOTHER ( almost screaming , unintentionally comic ) You know perfectly well we 're not going window-shopping . We 're going to the Plaza-Athenee , that 's where we 're going . DAFON Mama , have you lost your mind ? We simply ca n't impose ourselves on a total stranger because of a silly coincidence . Please do n't make a fool of yourself . MOTHER Nobody will be made a fool of who does n't deserve to be made a fool of . Just please do n't forget , Lily Dafon , I am a mother ! Your mother . If my daughter is  --  ( she wags her head several times from side to side , with anger ) I want to know about it . p. 26 DAFON Must you also know that she is n't ?

DAFON Mama , you 've gone mad . MOTHER Oh , I 've gone mad all right . Why would n't I go mad ? For almost twenty years , from the time you were a little girl , I have lived for you  --  everybody in this family has lived for you . The best private tutors , the best private schools , Latin and Italian , harp and conversation , cooking and poise , algebra and ballet , music-appreciation and Swedish gymnastics , the Renaissance and poetry-writing . I 've spent a fortune on your teeth alone . You 've got good bones , and you 're strong  --  cod-liver oil and calcium . DAFON Oh , Mama ! MOTHER For what ? For Texas ?

( he barks ) Bow-wow . SECOND DOG Me , too . ( he barks , too ) Bow-wow . THIRD DOG What 's going on around here ? ( he barks , too ) Bow-wow . The birds break into a kind of crazy song , as the curtain comes down. @x George Hannaberry 's apartment at the Plaza-Athenee . Hannabery , a tall , slim , muscular , earnest and intense man in his late fifties is on the telephone . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Yep . That 's right . Right . Do it that way . Right . ( suddenly losing patience ) Warren , you 've had me on this phone for almost an hour , and for ten days now you 've called at least once a day , sometimes twice . But we agreed when I left that you would run the show . The whole show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You 're a big boy now , Warren . ( he listens ) I do n't care how much we lose by any decision you make . Just make the decision . ( suddenly ) Hold on a minute , will you ? Operator , I know a call is waiting , but I ca n't take it just now , that 's all . Warren ? Sorry , but the operator keeps cutting in . Now listen to me , will you ? I 'm not interested in any gossip that has reached Dallas . I do n't know what the gossip is , but whatever it is , maybe there is something to it . ( listens ) All right , then , wine , women and song . ( listens , blows up ) I am not a potential Governor of Texas . I 'm a plain ordinary cowboy who struck it rich thirty years ago . Now , I want you to try to understand this , do n't let it seem too blunt , I just do n't know how else to put it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wanted a husband , that 's all . She 's wanted a Governor of Texas , and I 'm just not the man for the job . I do n't know what I can do for her , but the time came ten days ago when I knew I had to do something for myself . Do you understand ? ( listens ) The answer is I 'm going to stay in Paris , or somewhere in Europe , or Asia , even , as long as I know I need to . So long now , take it easy , and do n't phone any more . ( He hangs up , thinks a moment , and then lifts the receiver. ) p. 29 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Operator , I 'm finished with my call now . ( he waits a moment ) Hello . ( listens ) Yes , that 's right . Yes , by all means . It 's 209 . He hangs up , looks around the place , goes to the portable bar , puts ice in a tall glass , pours a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips , and then decides against taking even a taste of the stuff . He goes to the double door , and opens both sides . Lily and her mother appear in the doorway . There is an almost imperceptible start , something like a movement of recognition , although it might be no more than a movement of delight , or surprise , in Hannaberry , when he sees Lily . And there is something of the same sort in Lily , too . There is no telling what it means . Perhaps they have met , after all . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY ( cordially , gladly , simply , bowing ) Please come in. ( they go in . The atmosphere is simultaneously a little strained and a little wonderful ) I hope you wo n't mind my saying how happy I am to see you  --  both . Especially at this particular time . Please sit down . MOTHER ( remains standing ) We can stay only a moment . p. 30 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Oh , I 'm sorry . And of course I 'm terribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unavoidable . Hannaberry and Lily keep exchanging glances , but the meaning of them is impossible to interpret . And Lily 's mother keeps noticing . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY May I introduce myself ? I am George Washington Hannaberry of Dallas , Texas . My father named all of his sons after American Presidents , and all of his daughters after famous actresses . And I 've done the same , only I have no daughters  --  just three sons . Warren Harding Hannaberry . He was just on the phone , calling from Dallas . Calvin Coolidge Hannaberry . And Wendell Wilkie Hannaberry . Now , Wendell Wilkie did n't actually ever become President , but I knew him , and I liked him , and I wanted him to be President , and my last boy was born just after Wilkie was defeated , so I said to myself " Shoot , I 'm going to name this fellow Wendell Wilkie just the same , " and I did . It 's a good name . MOTHER I am Countess Violet Dafon . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I 'm certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak French or I 'd say it in French , and then I 'm sure it would sound a little better . MOTHER We speak English , Mr. Hannaberry . Also Italian and German , and enough Spanish and Russian to make ourselves understood . This is my daughter , Lily . Hannaberry bows . The Countess waits for Hannaberry to speak . He becomes aware that she is waiting , and then he becomes confused and a little awkward , physically . p. 31 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Oh , please sit down , wo n't you ? MOTHER Only for a moment , then . ( Lily and her mother sit on the edges of chairs , as if they might jump up suddenly and stamp out of the place . ) GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Oh , but please sit . You 're not comfortable . MOTHER No , we are not , Mr. Hannaberry , and I 'm not sure we want to be . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I 'm sorry . Is there anything I can do ? A glass of champagne , perhaps ? MOTHER Not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but who knows , maybe he 's acting . If he is , he is a great actor , unknown in the theatrical world , but great all the same.My name means nothing to you , Mr. Hannaberry ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I would n't say that at all . I 've met a number of Countesses before , when they were travelling in Texas , and I 've always been impressed by the fact that they were Countesses . But I 've always believed that people are people , too . MOTHER I was not referring to my title , Mr. Hannaberry . Titles mean nothing , especially in France . So many people have them . I was referring to my name . p. 32 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I 'm afraid I did n't quite hear it , from having been so impressed by the Countess part of it . MOTHER Dafon . D-a-f-o-n . And this is my daughter Lily . ( clearly ) Lily Dafon . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY ( delighted , leaps to his feet ) Of course ! Lily Dafon. ( to Lily ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday at Long-champ . MOTHER Not my daughter 's horse , Mr. Hannaberry . A horse named in honor of my daughter by an old friend of the family , Monsieur Jean-Paul Tabac . He 's a diamond merchant . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Well , they 're very expensive , I know , because I 've given quite a few of them to my wife . MOTHER ( obviously coming to the main issue ) Mr. Hannaberry  --  Lily takes her mother 's wrist very firmly . She appears to be deeply ashamed , but at the same time enchanted with Hannaberry and terrified that her mother will say something stupid and make him change . Hannaberry waits . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Yes , ma'am ? What is the proper form ? Yes , Countess ? It does n't seem quite right for me , but I 'll be glad to try it . I mean if it makes a difference . p. 33 MOTHER You speak with great natural courtesy , Mr. Hannaberry . Have no care on that account . I am concerned about another matter . GEORGE WASHINGTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to open my big mouth and put my foot in , as I have done many a time , but do you know , I do n't think the money I won on that horse belongs to me at all , and if there 's any possible way I can pass it along to you , or to a favorite charity , it would make me happy to do so . MOTHER Whatever money you may have is yours , Mr. Hannaberry , however it may have come into your possession . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Ah , well , I 'm sorry , it was just a thought . You see , I liked the name in the program in the first place , and then when I went down to the paddock and saw the little filly  --  Well , now , I 'm a cowboy , Countess  --  Countess Violet ? ( the Countess nods )  --  that 's what I am , I know horses and love them , and I just had to put my money on that pretty little black filly . Black and sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Dallas girl at her first dance . I thought I 'd bet , oh , fifty thousand francs  --  that 's about a hundred dollars . And then I thought , Ah , she 's too sweet a creature to play so cheap , so I decided I 'd bet a hundred thousand , but French currency is so bulky , it makes your clothes bulge out , and I had a little more than two thousand dollars ' worth in my pocket , which makes quite a bulge , so when I got to the window I just laid one pinned bundle on top of another in front of the man until there were ten bundles . A million francs , and I really did n't care if the little filly ran last . I only wanted to see her trying . p. 34 MOTHER We know the horse well . She has never before won a race . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY That 's what I heard . You do n't have the Racing Form in Paris , so a man from out of town ca n't really handicap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's all . Do you know , I did n't even know what the odds were ? I figured she might be three to one . But when they started paying off , I found out . What I still do n't understand is how a little win like that can be front-page news in Paris . Back home the only man who would take a sort of leaning interest in the transaction would be from the Office of the Collector of Internal Revenue . That 's the tax collector . And he 'd have a legal right to seize the money , too . Happened to me one time at Arlington Park in Chicago . I used to go up there from Dallas three of four times a year in my own plane to see about getting rid of my cattle at some sort of small profit , or maybe just a small loss . ( suddenly ) Now , wo n't you please accept a glass of champagne , because I believe I 'd like some myself , and where I come from a man do n't drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . ( He is pouring , and nobody refuses , so he hands the glasses around ) What I mean is , at those odds , twenty to one , a million francs was a bad bet , a stupid bet , but there it is , if you 're ignorant , and lucky , it does n't matter . And I really wish you 'd let me pass along my good luck to you . p. 35 MOTHER Thank you , but such a thing is really not even to be thought of . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Well , I 'm sorry . ( the door buzzer buzzes ) Excuse me . ( He goes to the door , to receive polished shoes from the valet ) MOTHER ( Whispering ) Lily , it 's all perfectly clear to me now  --  you know this man . DAFON ( Whispering ) No more than you do , Mama . MOTHER No , you know him . He would n't speak so gladly if you did n't . DAFON I do n't know him , but I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  broker  --  of me . An agent . The very thought is humiliating . ( Hannaberry returns . ) Mr. Hannaberry , early this morning , my daughter received flowers from  --  somebody . By the name of George . She brings the card out of her handbag and passes it along to him . Hannaberry reads the message on the card in an inaudible whisper . MOTHER Did you write that message , Mr. Hannaberry ? p. 36 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY No , Ma'am , but I 'm afraid I did send the flowers . I mean , I had them sent . You know , when I get to a new town , I go to work and read around in the telephone book . I enjoy reading names . I guess it 's because I know there 's a living person for every name in the book . Well , Lily Dafon . Now , that 's a name . It is a name . After the races when I got back up here and poured myself a drink I looked for that name in the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there it was . So I phoned down to the hall porter , and said I wanted to send some flowers to somebody . He put me through to the hotel flower shop and I told the boy on the phone to send a lot of flowers to Lily Dafon . He said , Any message ? And without half-really-thinking I said , yes , you write something and send it along . And he did . I 'm sorry , Ma'am . He does n't quite know what to do with the card . He slips it into the handkerchief pocket of his jacket , as if to hide it . MOTHER We must go now , thank you very much , Mr. Hannaberry . ( Lily and her mother stand . ) GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Ah , please do n't go . Wo n't you have lunch with me ? After lunch we can take a horse carriage to Longchamp . We do n't care if we 're late , we 'll get there for the fourth race . And we 'll bet back this money I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a lot of trouble putting it in my income tax report . p. 37 MOTHER Thank you , but we must go . Goodbye . Hannaberry opens both doors and escorts Lily and her mother to the hall just as a very fat and rather untidy man wearing white tie and tails and carrying a fat briefcase , puffs up the hall . The man slows down , noticing Lily , and wagging his head in admiration . He then goes along , but only a short distance . He stops just a little beyond where Hannaberry stands , staring after Lily and her mother . Suddenly Lily runs back in a kind of youthful exuberance , energy , speed and simple gladness . All the same , one is n't sure there is n't something more to it than that : it could be that a girl had run back to her secret lover . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY ( pleased , but confused too ) How nice to see you again . DAFON ( almost whispering ) How nice to see you again , too . ( Slight pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HANNABERRY What card ? DAFON With the flowers . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Oh , of course , but I did n't write it , you know ? DAFON She wants it back . p. 38 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY She does ? ( Looking at the card ) I never sent a card like that in my life . But I 'm glad that that boy down there at the flower store did . ( He hands her the card ) DAFON I 'm sorry . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY What in the world for ? DAFON I mean , about Mama . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY The Countess ?  --  Well , let me tell you something  --  she 's a real Countess . DAFON No , she is n't  --  only by marriage . But maybe not even by marriage . I do n't know very much about my father . Only the name of the photographer on the back on his photograph  --  Aristide Gonzalez . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY ( delighted ) No fooling ? Maybe he was more than a Count . DAFON Maybe less , too . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I do n't . I mean , I 'm sorry Mama came here . No , I 'm glad she came here , I 'm sorry she made trouble for you . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY It was no trouble at all . DAFON ( Softer than ever ) Why ca n't young men be old men the way old men are young men ? She jumps up , kisses him on the cheek and runs off . Hannaberry stands watching her , rubbing his cheek . He returns a wave from her , then another . In the meantime the fat man has come closer and closer , around in front of Hannaberry , watching . When Hannaberry finally comes out of it and notices the fat man , he nods . p. 39 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY ( Making small talk ) How about this weather , man ? RAMPANNEAU Oui , Monsieur . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Well , come on in , then . RAMPANNEAU Oui , Monsieur . ( They go in ) GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Drink ? RAMPANNEAU Merci , Monsieur . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( With an accent ) Oh , yes , sir . I was a prisoner for five years . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY ( Hands him a glass of champagne ) Of the Americans ? RAMPANNEAU Oh , no , I was on the same side with the Americans . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Ah , well . You learned English somewhere , and that 's good enough for me . RAMPANNEAU I could tell how it happened , but I 've heard the story , and it 's not very good . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY George Hannaberry. p. 40 RAMPANNEAU Leloup Ramponneau . Hannaberry makes a big Texas swoop of the arm from away back , and out to the Fat Man . He is surely giving an imitation of the European 's idea of the loudmouth American in Europe : but again there 's no telling : he may be revealing his gladness about the return of Lily , and their little talk . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Put her there , Pardner ! He seizes the Fat Man 's hand , and the Fat Man almost goes to his knees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAMPANNEAU Wow ! How you say it ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY That 's how . RAMPANNEAU I pick up these things in the five years , but it 's a long story . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY You live in Paris , do you ? RAMPANNEAU Oui , Monsieur . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Here at this hotel ? Just down the hall here ? RAMPANNEAU Oolala , no , Monsieur . Leloup Rampanneau is not  --  how you say it ?  --  loaded . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY ( Noticing his fat ) Well , maybe not with money . You 're visiting friends at the hotel , are you ? p. 41 RAMPANNEAU Maybe , maybe not . ( He makes French gestures : half and half , no telling , it remains to be seen , and so on ) I am visiting you , Monsieur . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Well , yes , at this moment , but were n't you on your way down the hall just now ? RAMPANNEAU Mistake . I was looking for 209 . The door was open , I could n't see the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? RAMPANNEAU Oui , Monsieur . I was . Yes , sir . To see you . Monsieur George Hannaberry . ( He holds up the morning paper ) GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY What are you selling ? RAMPANNEAU Everything . What do you want ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Nothing . RAMPANNEAU Anything . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Do you know , I 'd never take you for a salesman . RAMPANNEAU Supersalesman . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I thought you were a diplomat , just back from Geneva . Briefcase . Blubber . Gift of gab. p. 42 RAMPANNEAU No . I sell . Anything . You have money . I find for you , anything . You like to take home something ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Nope . RAMPANNEAU That means same as no ? Or maybe ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY No . RAMPANNEAU I put it in the box . ( Taps the side of his head ) Nope . Right ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Right . Have some more champagne . ( He pours ) RAMPANNEAU You do n't throw me out ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I do n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Well , at the moment , Leloup  --  is that right ? Leloup ? RAMPANNEAU Oui , Monsieur . I sell you French lessons . I got English lady teaches French . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY No , what I mean , Leloup , is  --  right now I feel very good , and I do n't mind letting somebody else know . In this case , you . I feel better than I 've felt in a long time . p. 43 RAMPANNEAU ( Apparently remembering Lily and Hannaberry a moment ago , with a rascally voice ) Ha , ha , oui , Monsieur , I understand , you mean la , la , ( He wiggles his free hand ) la tomat ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY No , I do n't mean la tomat . RAMPANNEAU How you say in English for la , la  --  ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY We say young lady . RAMPANNEAU ( Corrected ) Oui , Monsieur . ( Softly ) What do you mean , then ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I mean the world . I mean people , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand . Sometimes the world is dirt . Sometimes the world is  --  what shall I say ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Dirt , but good dirt . RAMPANNEAU Sometimes people are  --  bad . And then sometimes people are  --  who knows the right word ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Still bad , but all of a sudden something more than only bad . RAMPANNEAU ( Almost as if a fat little boy were speaking ) Why is this like this ? p. 44 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY ( Casually , lightly , but also earnestly , speaking almost to himself ) I 'm not sure , Leloup , but I think it has something to do with the way you look at the whole thing . For instance , everybody , every one of us  --  pretty soon we 're not going to be here , that 's all . I do n't mean a war or anything like that . We 're just not going to be here . Every one of us . Even that rare girl out there a moment ago . She could turn around and fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas just a few days ago and noticed that fifty years had gone . I do n't know where they went . Oh , I know exactly where they went , but not really , Leloup , not really . This world is nothing . And we 're nothing , but after you know these things , after you 've learned them , this is one sweet place , and human beings are  --  more than any human being could ever guess . RAMPANNEAU You want to buy a Bible ? I got an old man got an old Bible , written by hand , lots of color pictures , very special . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY No thanks , Leloup . RAMPANNEAU I come again tomorrow ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Why not ? RAMPANNEAU Same time ? p. 45 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY O.K. , but telephone from downstairs first . RAMPANNEAU Of course . This was first time . Au Revoir , Monsieur . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Look after yourself . Watch that weight a little , will you ? RAMPANNEAU ( Disgusted with his fat ) If I sell nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat . Fat , fat , fat . What a fool I was  --  to eat breakfast . Again . ( In despair ) No control . ( Softly ) No control . ( He goes ) p. 46 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT TWOScene 2 The scene is open space , signifying any place , any time . The three dogs are over to one side in a kind of family group . The three bird cages are over to the other side in a second group . There is a waiter in an appropriate place , waiting . Girls of Paris walk about slowly , half-loitering , each of them looking like Brigitte Bardot . Lily appears with George Murat-Dufour . MURAT-DUFOUR Of course a tree can be re-designed . It 's simply a matter of determining the purpose of a tree . Is it for birds to put nests in , for instance , is it for shade , or is it for boys to build a house in ? Not at all . These are things that trees have always been misunderstood to be for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbol  --  of any number of things . My client is a genius . As a matter of fact , he 's a character . Actually , some people might say he 's eccentric . Others might say he 's crazy . And so of course I re-designed the tree to be a symbol of him . It 's in a garden just behind his small house , a very small garden , a very small tree , old with brittle little branches , and dry gray leaves that have a rather tired odor . Well , I painted the trunk and the branches of the tree yellow and orange , a kind of color of the sun , and then I painted the leaves all of the remaining colors. p. 47 DAFON Oh , George , you are a genius of course , but I wish you 'd get a good commission sometime . MURAT-DUFOUR This is the best commission I 've ever had . Here , come over here . I 'll show it to you . ( A strong light reveals the strange little tree . It looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) DAFON It 's beautiful , George ! It makes me proud to think that you made it . MURAT-DUFOUR No , Lily . All I did was transform the tree into a symbol of my client . All I did was transform a natural thing into a work of art . Of course during the process the tree died . DAFON You killed the tree ? MURAT-DUFOUR Lily , it was as good as dead in any case . It had been for years . I did n't kill it , I gave it a soul . Immortality . Murphy 's Tree it 's called . DAFON Murphy ? MURAT-DUFOUR Oh , the family 's been in Paris since the time of Napoleon . Murphy himself , an odd , old , little man , who walks very lightly , almost dancing , comes to the tree to look upon it with delight . After a moment the light goes out , and Murphy and Murphy 's Tree disappear . p. 48 DAFON George , I 've never seen anything so beautiful . Never . But somehow  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking . And I know what a fool I am , but I would rather you at least continued to pretend you had n't noticed . Everybody else has . My family , your family , Paris . Now , let 's just sit down here and keep our big mouths shut for a minute . They sit . The waiter brings them each a glass of something to drink . They sit in silence . The light goes out on the table . When it comes up again , Hannaberry is with Lily at the same table . DAFON Of course there 's such a thing as the art of conversation . Is n't there in Texas ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Oh , no , Texans just talk . DAFON But conversation is more than talk . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Well , if you say so , Lily , but I never heard a conversation where the people did n't open their mouth , waggle their tongues , and move their lower jaws . DAFON Of course , but conversation is different . First , it is necessary to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be concerned about who is there . And then you must take an interest in the person you are with . If he is a poet , for instance , you ought to know his poetry , and its relationship to other contemporary poetry , and to all poetry . p. 49 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY You should ? DAFON Of course . Well , let 's say , for instance , you and I had just met at a dinner party , and I did n't know anything about you . Well , I might say , Perhaps you are a singing cowboy . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I 'm afraid not , although as a kid on the range , I used to enjoy playing the harmonica . I was pretty good at it , too . Just the songs of Texas and the West , of course . When I got tired of playing those songs , I 'd play anything I felt like . The old cowhands claimed the stuff was pretty good , too . Sometimes they 'd ask me to play something over again , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had played . There 's a lot of space out there , and a boy has got to notice all that sand and sky , and when he does , he dreams . ( From far-away harmonica music is heard faintly as Hannaberry talks . ) And you know what happens to dreams  --  they 're forgotten . You can never forget the idea of a dream , but you can never remember the details , either , and it 's the details that really count . The harmonica stops . The light goes out on the table . When the light comes up on the table Lily 's greatgrandfather and his mistress are at the table . Suddenly Lily 's greatgrandmother , her grandmother , and her mother appear , walking together . p. 50 GREATGRANDMOTHER I tell you Lily met him long before you took her to the hotel . MOTHER And I tell you she did n't . GRANDMOTHER What 's the difference ? She met him . MOTHER My pride , that 's all . My pride . GREATGRANDMOTHER Oh , come along , with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jumps up from the table , and tries to hide behind his mistress . The group walks by , and it seems as if nobody in the group has noticed anything , but suddenly Lily 's greatgrandmother disengages herself from the group . She looks straight at her crouched , hiding , ridiculous-looking husband . She points her cane at him , swings it around , almost jauntily , and then moves on . The greatgrandfather remains in hiding much longer than he needs to . He sticks his head out , and finding the coast clear , he gets up and takes his place at the table , while the waiter watches , an expression of scorn on his face . GREATGRANDFATHER Did she see me ? MISTRESS Did who see you ? GREATGRANDFATHER Ah , well . ( he turns toward the waiter ) Waiter , will you take my order , please . ( the Waiter ignores him . He speaks louder ) Waiter ! I 've waited too long  --  take my order , please . ( the Waiter does n't move , does n't turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Waiter ! ( he begins to shout ) I have n't got very much time , sir . Will you please be good enough to take my order . p. 51 MISTRESS Sit down ! You 'll have a stroke . ( The birds break into fierce song , the dogs bark , the stage goes dark. ) p. 52 Act 2 , Scene 3 ACT TWOScene 3 . George Hannaberry 's apartment at the Plaza-Athenee . He comes into the sitting room , shuts the door behind him , wipes his mouth with the napkin he 's carrying , glances at the shut door , thinking , then tosses the napkin into the wastepaper basket . It is early evening , and he is dressed to go out . He opens both of the doors to the hall , and stands waiting . After a moment Warren appears , followed by a bellboy carrying his briefcase and a leather suitcase . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY Well , I must say you 're looking well . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY All right , Warren , let 's have it . You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to fly here , so you flew here . Well , I do n't mean to be rude , but you better tell that boy to take those bags to your own place . This is mine . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY ( pleasantly ) O.K. , man . ( to the bellboy in badly pronounced French ) Will you please take the luggage to the reception ? I 'll pick it up later . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY He speaks English . ( to the bellboy ) Do n't you ? BELLBOY Yes , sir . ( He goes , Hannaberry shuts the door. ) p. 53 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY And if you do n't mind , I 'd rather you went to another hotel , too . There are a lot of good ones around , the George Sank , the Prince of Wales . ( he pours drinks , notices Warren watching him , smiling ) What are you smiling about ? WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY It 's good to see you , that 's what . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY ( they lift glasses , drink ) I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY At the office , yes . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Well , I know how they 're going at home , too , but there 's just nothing I can do about that . In any case , it must be what your mother wants . If it 's a little tough on you and Calvin and Wendell  --  well , fight it out.How are they ? WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY They 're O.K. GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY And how is she ? WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY O.K. , too . You know what I mean . Sometimes I think we 've all ganged up on her with our feelings of being pushed around . We 're four against one . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I felt guilty that way for a long time , and it just did n't do me any good . Did n't do her any , either . I ca n't think that way any more . Now , I do n't want to give you the bum 's rush or anything , but if there is some reason for your being here , what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday morning she did order me to fly here , and I had every intention of refusing , and every reason to refuse , but all of a sudden it seemed to me I 'd better see you . Now , and not when you get back to Texas . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Why ? WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY Because I 've always seen you as the head of the family , a father , and now you 're out of all that . You 're free again . Your kids are grown up . Your marriage has ended . I wanted to see how you 'd take this failure , and this freedom . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I suppose you imagined I 'd be spending all my time chasing women , gambling , and getting drunk . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY Some of your time . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Well , I have had a little too much to drink now and then . I 've gambled a little , too . I drove up to Deauville a couple of times , but casinos depress me . And I 've been out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY That leaves women . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Well , you 're not likely to see more attractive women anywhere else in the world . They 're not the most beautiful , but they are smart , and they like the idea of being women . How 's Elsie ? p. 55 WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY Just fine , the same as ever . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY You keep after Elsie . She 'll give you a daughter one of these days . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY Well , she 's pregnant again , at any rate . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY ( truly pleased ) Good for her . And good for you , Warren . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY So we 've got three sons , and maybe a daughter coming , and we 're crazy about each other , and about our kids , and they 're crazy about us , but it 's early now , and before we know it , it 'll be late . The kids 'll be grown up , and something will happen to the marriage , to the family , to Elsie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it have to happen ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Time will go by , and time going , time gone , makes a difference . You can only hope the difference will make sense . Are you sure you did n't come here because your mother ordered you to ? WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY Positive . I came for myself . For this talk , as a matter of fact . During the foregoing , there have been little sounds of people not far off , of soft speech , of laughter , but Warren has n't paid too much attention to the sounds . Hannaberry , however , has n't been able to conceal his concern about them . Now , suddenly , Lily , dressed for the theatre , comes out of the adjoining room . She is dazzling , radiant , younger and brighter-looking than ever . Warren is surprised , possibly even shocked , but at the same time he is delighted to see a girl so beautiful . Lily moves almost in a straight line from the door into the sitting room to the door , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to Hannaberry , then to Warren . p. 56 WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY Who was that ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Lily Dafon . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY ( confused ) Well , is that all ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY It 's enough . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY I mean  --  GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I know what you mean . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY O.K. , I do n't get it , but then I suppose I do n't need to . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY No , you do n't . Now , the door to the sitting room opens again and out comes Lily 's mother , then her grandmother , and finally her greatgrandmother . They look great . They follow the same course as Lily , and in much the same manner , smiling and nodding to Hannaberry and Warren , as they go . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY I hope you wo n't feel I 'm letting my curiosity get the better of me , but who were they ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Lily 's mother , grandmother , and greatgrandmother . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY Is such a thing possible ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARDING HANNABERRY I mean , they 're all so  --  what can I say ? Wonderful ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Yes , you can say that . ( points to the door ) What were they doing in there ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY They were having supper with me on the terrace . I skipped dessert and coffee when you phoned from downstairs . You might have sent a telegram . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY And spoil this ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Then , you have come to spy on me . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY Spy my eye . I came to see a free man , but I never expected you to be this free . Where in the world did you find them ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY They found me . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY Well , do they always travel in a group , and just walk by that way ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY We 're going to the theatre  --  a new play by one of these new crazy playwrights . I told them I was being visited by a business associate and might have to reach the theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , look , I do n't want to spoil your evening . I 'll phone you tomorrow . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY No , it 's all right . Opening night curtains are always late . I told them to go on , because I know they enjoy watching the people come in . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY You 've taken them to the theatre before ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Only to the openings of the more interesting plays  --  the really new ones . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY All four of them  --  or are there more ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY No , four is all , but this is the first time we 've all been out together . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY ( pleasantly , almost with admiration ) Who 's who ? I mean , which one is the one you  --  GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Lily , of course . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY Of course . How foolish of me not to have known . She 's seventeen , is n't she ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I never brought the matter up , but I think she may be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as all that ? Is n't that too old for you ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY No , it is n't . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY I think my favorite is the oldest one , the one with the cane . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY She 's a remarkable woman . I do n't believe she trusts me , but at the same time I 'm not sure she is n't glad she does n't . They 're all remarkable women . They 're like nothing we could ever find in Texas , or anywhere else in America , I suppose . They 're Paris . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY Pure and simple . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Pure , most likely , but I do n't know about simple . They 're certainly unaffected , direct , and attractive , but there 's no telling what else they may be . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY You 're prepared to  --  well , pay them off when the time comes ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Well , I certainly owe them a great deal , but they absolutely refuse to accept anything . A key is heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door opens , and Lily comes in . Warren 's expression says oh boy . p. 60 DAFON George is sick , poor boy . He ca n't come to the theatre . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY What 's the matter with him ? DAFON Mumps . He did n't get it as a child . Nobody can go near him for two weeks . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Ah , that 's too bad . Is n't there somebody else you 'd like , to take his place ? DAFON It 's too late , but I thought you might ask your friend . ( She hands Hannaberry the ticket . She smiles and nods to Warren again , and goes ) WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY Well , who is this George , with the mumps ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Lily 's fiance . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY She 's got a key to your apartment , and a fiance , too ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY They 've known each other since they were kids . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY And now he knows you , too . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY We 're good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put him to work for me . For us , Warren . He 's an architect . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY Well , we could ask him to build us a private lunatic asylum , I suppose . p. 61 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Yes , and he 'd do it , too . Gladly . Want to come to the theatre ? WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY Of course , but you know damn well I 'm not going to . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY No , come on . I 'd really like you to . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY Nothing doing . Where is this Prince of Wales Hotel ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Just a couple of blocks . Take this ticket and if you change your mind , come and sit with us . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY Out of the question . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY We 're going to Maxim 's afterwards , because they 've been going there for fifty years or more . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY I 'll go have some supper , and then go out on the town on my own . Where can I find somebody like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HANNABERRY Dafon . Nowhere . ( earnestly , but smiling ) I do n't want to try to tell you how to live your life at this late date , Warren , but watch it , will you ? Do n't forget Elsie , and the boys , and the one coming . I mean  --  WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY Oh , I know what you mean . p. 62 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Now , I 'll skip the theatre , or most of it , at any rate , if you really want me to . If there 's anything more to discuss . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY No , as a matter of fact , I think we 've covered everything . I 'll have supper , take in a movie , and fly back tomorrow morning . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Are you sure that that 's what you want to do ? WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY Well , it was n't a moment ago , but it is now . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY How come ? WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY Hell , there 's no woman in this world can hold a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to surprise her . She believes I may be gone for as long as two weeks . I wanted to see you free . I 've seen you free . I think it 's great . I only wish your wife could be free , too . Of a dead marriage . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY ( sits down , suddenly overcome by profound regret . He speaks in a hushed voice ) Do you want me to fly back in the morning , too , Warren ? If you do , say so . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY No , I do n't . Because I do n't think it would improve matters at all . I have n't made you feel guilty , have I ? p. 63 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY You have n't , but the fact is I do . The marriage is dead . It died a long time ago , but thirty years just ca n't be kicked out of a man 's blood and memory in a month , or a year , or ten years , or maybe ever . I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fly back in the morning  --  WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY The way you were a moment ago was the way I hoped you 'd be  --  not this way , now , the way you 've been at home for so long . Paralyzed , confused , and helpless . If you want to go back , you 've got to decide why . I would n't be able to guess , even . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY ( deeply weary ) I do n't feel like going to any theatre . I do n't feel like going anywhere . WARREN HARDING HANNABERRY Well , you 've got to go . And I 've got to fly back in the 've never really talked very much , certainly not like this . I 'll be staying on . No telling how long . It 'll probably be until I can think of a good reason to come back . I 'll ride in the taxi with you to the Prince of Wales . ( They go out together. ) @x Two weeks later . A box at a theatre in Paris during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box at the moment , but soon Lily Dafon returns . DAFON You 'll never guess who I just ran into . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Who ? DAFON George Murat-Dufour . The doctors lifted the quarantine early this evening , and he 's been delirious ever since . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Like a prisoner after thirty years in the penitentiary ? DAFON Oh , no , not like that at all . He enjoyed the quarantine . It 's the work he did while he got over the mumps . You 'll never guess what it is . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY What is it ? DAFON A new world . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Oh , that . DAFON To come after this one is destroyed . Well , George expects to survive . And of course he expects me to survive , too  --  in order to start the human race all over again , he said . p. 65 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY He did ? DAFON Oh , yes . I know of no one who is more generous-hearted . It 's just that he has so little to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY How about his love ? DAFON I do n't really think George hates , or loves . He 's too preoccupied with his thoughts , his ideas , his discoveries . I know he is opposed to emotionality of any kind . He says it 's completely out of date  --  belongs to the ice age . Why get excited ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Yes , especially about an idea for a new world . DAFON Oh , but that 's different . That 's another kind of excitement entirely . That 's for everybody . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY For George ? And for you ? DAFON ( suddenly no longer being deliberately amusing ) Are you jealous of George ? Really ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Well , you 're certainly never more alive than after you 've been with him , even if only for a moment . DAFON But I have n't seen him in two weeks , and I did n't expect to see him now at all . I was surprised , and of course very happy . p. 66 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sit with us ? DAFON He 's with his mother . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY There 's enough room for her , too , is n't there ? DAFON There is n't enough room in this whole theatre for her and me at the same time . She hates me . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Is that possible ? I mean , for a woman of Paris ? DAFON Ah , but she 's from Bordeaux . She was brought here as an infant , but every summer she goes back to Bordeaux for a month or two . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY How far is Bordeaux ? DAFON Oh , three hundred kilometers , I suppose . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Does three hundred kilometers make that much difference ? It 's more than three hundred kilometers from the water-pump on my ranch to the branding shed . DAFON Your ranch is bigger than France ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY No , but I may buy a ranch that is . DAFON In Texas ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Oh , yes , I would n't live anywhere else . p. 67 DAFON You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me ? But she decides to put it another way )  --  France ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I believe I can truthfully say that I love France , if that 's not putting it too strongly . If it 's not being too emotional . I 'd like to get out of the ice age as soon as possible , the same as George Murat-Dufour . If he ca n't hate anybody , I ca n't understand how his mother can hate you . He 's her son . DAFON Her only child . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY All the more reason for her to love you . DAFON ( Delighted ) Really ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Of course . DAFON She used to love me . At least I thought she did . I certainly loved her . But then when she began to hate me , I began to hate her right back . That 's the way I am . I just ca n't love anybody who hates me . Sometimes I think I ought to see a psychiatrist . There she is now . ( Lily waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate her all right . DAFON I loathe her . It was n't necessary for her to wave that way . She did it on purpose , to make people look in this direction , to make them see me . To make them see me with you . p. 68 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY By now most of them have seen us together , have n't they ? DAFON Yes , and all Paris is talking about us , too . But to be pointed out in public . She did it to let me know how much she hates me . To let everybody know . People of Paris , behold my darling son 's fiance at the theatre again  --  with a rich old man . ( Shocked at what she has said ) Oh , I 'm sorry . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Never be sorry for telling the truth . DAFON But it 's not the truth . Not my truth . It 's only her lie . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I am an old man . I 'm certainly more than twice as old as her son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( She is shocked again by what she has said , but ca n't think of anything more to say , or any way to explain or justify it ) GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Well , it 's your greatgrandfather and me fighting for honors , I guess . ( He falls silent ) DAFON I could kill myself . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY The theatre 's quieting down , the second act 's about to begin , let 's just look and listen . p. 69 DAFON I do n't want to see it . I do n't want to be in the same theatre with that ugly woman . She 's made me make a fool of myself . I feel sick . Will you please take me home ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Lily , are you serious ? DAFON Please take me home . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Of course . ( They get up ) DAFON Do n't look , but do you know what that woman 's doing ? She 's waving goodbye . I simply will not wave back . I do n't care what my education has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theatre , and she wants the whole world to know , too . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Do n't let her do it , Lily . There 's still time . Now , sit right down in the chair just ahead . That 's why we got up  --  to get to the chairs just ahead , because we like the play . Now , sit down , Lily . You ca n't let her drive you away  --  mad . ( Lily smiles at him , on behalf of the woman , and anybody else who might be watching . She accepts the chair from Hannaberry , and sits ) DAFON I 'll show her . If she wants to fight , I 'll give her the best fight of her life . ( The house lights go down , the audience falls silent , the curtain goes up , and the play continues ) ( From the stage an unseen man 's high-pitched voice is heard ) p. 70 MAN 'S VOICE Until only a moment ago the cry of mortal breath was a cry for liberty , equality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence , humor . But now the cry is only for help . The whale in the sea cries for help . The frog in the pond cries for help . The lion in the jungle cries for help . The bird in the sky cries for help . The stones in the fields cry for help . Water cries for help . Air cries for help . Time cries for help . I cry for help , and you  --  ( Unseen woman 's high-pitched voice ) WOMAN 'S VOICE I want a new hat . ( The voices continue , but from far away . Lily takes Hannaberry 's hand ) DAFON Thank you for not letting that woman drive me away . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY O.K. , but watch the play now . DAFON Oh , but I 've read it . I 've read it three times . I know it by heart . They 're married , and everything 's wrong . In the marriage , and out of the marriage  --  everywhere . Everything seems to know it is now or never , the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the wife , she cries for a new hat . It means  --  GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I know what it means . DAFON Do you like it ? p. 71 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Yes , I do . DAFON He 's a new writer . Would you like to meet him after the play , backstage ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Oh , no . DAFON He does n't look like a playwright at all . More like a banker . Very cheerful , not sad like his plays . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY In Texas bankers are not cheerful . DAFON They are n't cheerful in France , either , but he looks like a banker who is cheerful . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Does n't she want you to marry her son ? DAFON Of course she does . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Then , what 's all the fighting about ? DAFON She does n't want me to see you . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY You see him , too , do n't you ? DAFON I have n't for two weeks , and I have n't been out in public with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon sometimes with George before he got the mumps . Before  --  we met  --  I never went out with the same man twice . All of a sudden she 's taken it into her head that my being cut with you is an affront , an insult to her  --  imagine it , to her ! She took my mother to lunch to tell her , and I had an awful time with my mother . p. 72 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY When was that ? DAFON Day before yesterday . I did n't want to tell you at the time , but that 's why I could n't go out with you last night . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I thought you had a headache . DAFON ( Looks at him with an expression made up of equal parts of love and disbelief that any man , even from Texas , could be so naive ) Of course I had a headache , and she gave it to me . Not Mama , his mother , but Mama , too  --  she actually took her side . I was forbidden ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where would I go ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY ( Dumbfounded ) I had no idea . I guess I 've been just about the biggest fool you 've ever met . DAFON Oh , no . I 've been the fool . I mean , to let them bully me that way . Why should n't I see you ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Well , there do appear to be a number of reasons , Lily . Marriage is a serious matter . DAFON Have I ever said marry me ? Have I ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Well , no , you have n't , but even if you had , I am married . p. 73 DAFON I 've had one day after another of the most wonderful happiness . Days of laughter and love . Real love , not imitation love . But now they want to take it all away from me . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Lily , are you sure they 're not right ? Oh , I do n't mean about taking away the laughter . I do n't suppose doing that could ever be right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to know you , to know just a little more about you every day , to have you all to myself  --  for the most wonderful time I have ever known , which I have always known must finally be followed by sorrow , leaving me memories I would n't exchange for anything else I have ever longed for in this world . ( Well , is she acting ? And is Hannaberry acting in playing it straight ? In going along with her ? ) I know now there is a greater love for men and women than any love they could ever find in marriage . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY There is ? I mean , I do n't think I like the idea that maybe without knowing it , without meaning to , I 've made you feel marriage is something  --  less  --  than what you used to think it was , because marriage is n't less . ( She gives him an odd look ) And believe me , I ought to know . p. 74 DAFON But it 's so official . That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so legal , and business-like . It 's like a trade in the market , with lawyers and contracts and names and dates . Oh , I know that some day I must go along with everybody else and be the party of the first part , with the party of the second part , but the very thought of it scares me  --  really scares me . Why ca n't I just have beautiful children with any attractive man I like ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY You can , I believe in Pago Pago . DAFON Why not in Paris , too ? And just put these beautiful children together in a beautiful home in the country , with wonderful nurses to look after them , and wonderful teachers to teach them Italian and swimming ? Why does everything have to be made  --  dull ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I do n't know . DAFON All of us swimming together in our own pool , in the sunshine , splashing and laughing , our dogs running around and barking , our birds singing , our golden apricots on our own glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think she 's right , Lily . DAFON Who ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY George 's mother . p. 75 DAFON You do n't want to see me any more ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I do n't want to make anybody in the world unhappy if I can help it , least of all you . ( Lily brings a handkerchief out of her bag , puts it to her mouth , and turns her head away from him ) Lily , you 're not crying , are you ? ( She nods , as if a little girl were crying but ashamed ) But why ? DAFON This is the part of the play that always makes me cry . The end of the second act . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I 've never seen you cry before . DAFON Great art always makes me cry  --  for all the people who died , the good ones , and the bad ones , and all the rest of them  --  all . Dead now , not like us , and nobody to remember them at all . Nobody . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were saying something else entirely ) Blow your nose , will you ? DAFON Yes . ( She blows her nose ) Oh , if you only knew how much I love you , and how sorry I am about my lovely , lost , sunshine-and-water children . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY No need to be sorry at all . You can have them with George . Now , straighten yourself out . The curtain 'll be down in a moment , and I want you to go straight to George 's mother and make up with her . p. 76 DAFON If you really think I should  --  ( The stage voices return to full volume now , and the man 's voice is heard almost chanting : ) MAN 'S VOICE The deserted highways cry for help . The abandoned automobiles cry for help . The empty office buildings cry for help . The broken streets cry for help . Art cries for help . Science cries for help . Religion cries for help . History cries for help . The moon cries for help . The sun cries for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . God cries for help . ( Loud applause is heard , and cries of bravo . Lily and Hannaberry applaud , Lily swiftly , Hannaberry slowly but steadily . Lily stands excited , Hannaberry beside her . ) DAFON Is n't it wonderful ? Crazy , and wonderful ? ( Suddenly ) Well , there she is , waving again ! GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Wave back , and go and make up . ( Lily waves , and leaves the box . The applause stops . Hannaberry sits down . After a moment Leloup Rampaneau comes into the box , huffing and puffing . ) GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Leloup ! For a moment I thought you were Booth come to shoot Lincoln . RAMPANNEAU ( points ) I saw you from the balcony . Excuse me , I had to come . Look at this , please . ( he brings an illustrated brochure and other papers out of the inside pocket of his jacket . ) Seventeenth century . Completely restored inside and out . Like new . Only twenty-two kilometres from the heart of Paris . Formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe the price . The greatest bargain I 've ever seen . Twenty acres of woods and a beautiful little fruit orchard . I know you do n't want a house , you told me again yesterday , but I did n't have this house yesterday . A complete staff , ready and waiting . A brand new swimming pool . p. 77 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY O.K. , Leloup . RAMPANNEAU You throw me out ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY No , buy it for me . ( Places finger on the brochure ) Is that the price ? The full price ? RAMPANNEAU Yes , but wait till you see the place . It 's worth ten times more . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY O.K. , you 've got a deal . RAMPANNEAU I 'll bring the papers to your apartment in the morning . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Make it in the afternoon . RAMPANNEAU Two o'clock ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Three . RAMPANNEAU Francs or dollars ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Either way . I 've got enough francs , I think . RAMPANNEAU You 're going to be the happiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What kind of fruit orchard ? RAMPANNEAU Apricots . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Are you sure ? p. 78 RAMPANNEAU Oh , yes . I was there . I saw them . I ate them . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY What about this play ? RAMPANNEAU ( A critical grunt ) Who knows ? This cries for help , that cries for help . Why ? What 's the matter ? Something happened ? Something 's going to happen ? What could happen ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY The world and everybody in it could be destroyed . RAMPANNEAU Oo , la la . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY That 's the theory , I mean , but of course it 's a pretty big job , and it just might prove to be impossible , even if everybody tried with all his might . RAMPANNEAU Everybody going to try ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY They say they are , if they must , but I do n't think they will . RAMPANNEAU That 's good . Lots of nice houses everywhere , lots of nice people . I 'll have everything ready at three tomorrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Do you go to the theatre often ? RAMPANNEAU Sometimes . ( Leloup goes quickly , Hannaberry watching him , trying to think , trying to put two and two together. ) p. 79 Act 3 , Scene 2 ACT THREEScene Two The stage is divided into two equal parts , which somewhat overlap . On the left is a portion of Lily 's home . On the right is a portion of George Hannaberry 's apartment at the Plaza-Athenee . Hannaberry is reading a newspaper . All of a sudden he stands at attention , and sings : GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY ( Singing ) The eyes of Texas are upon youDo not let her down . He stops as suddenly as he had started , sits down again , picks up the newspaper , and continues to examine it . Again , suddenly , he bolts to his feet , and sings:Bang the drum slowly ( And so on ) This time , however , he sings softly and almost mournfully . Again he sits down and picks up the newspaper . The doorbell rings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( A bellboy comes in , holding a small package ) BELLBOY I hope this is all right , Mr. Hannaberry . I had to go to three different places to find it . ( He brings out a harmonica in its case ) p. 80 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY ( Takes the case , removes the harmonica ) Yep . That 's the article all right . ( Gives the boy a jingle of coins ) Thanks . BELLBOY Thank you , Mr. Hannaberry . ( He goes ) GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY ( Examines the harmonica ) Peace and Harmony . Made in Germany . He turns it around in his hands , studying it . He holds it out at arm 's length and studies it some more . He tries fitting it into his hands , for playing . He sprawls out on the floor , as if he were back in Texas , long ago . After a moment he puts the instrument to his mouth , and begins to play very softly : Bang the drum slowly . The doorbell rings , but it is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or does n't want to be bothered . He goes right on playing . Soon the door opens slowly , and Wendell Hannaberry looks in , slowly , and shuts the door behind him . He stands watching and listening , unnoticed by his father , and then he sprawls out on the floor , and begins to sing the words of the song , very softly . Hannaberry turns , sees him , but continues to play . At the end of the song Hannaberry taps the harmonica lightly against the palm of his left hand to get the moisture out of it , and then sprawls flat on his back , as if he were looking up at the great sky of Texas at night . Wendell remains as he is , watching . p. 81 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY ( Speaks very slowly , softly , with great simplicity and dignity ) I was about your age in those days , maybe a little younger , Wendell . Last night I dreamed I was back there , and this morning I just had to send out for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any music out of the thing , and it scared me . I ca n't tell you how it scared me . I think I wept , although there was no sound to the sorrow at all , but I think I wept , as I have never before permitted myself to weep . As a kid I was too proud to let anybody know what I knew  --  this life , this world , this experience is great , this is the greatest , this is surely too great for us , but who knows , maybe if I try hard enough it wo n't be too great for me , and I 'll figure it out , because I 've got a lot of time , and I 've got a lot of -- me . That 's right , Wendell . A lot of me . But last night there was n't a lot left , and I just could n't get any sound at all to come out of the thing . It was all silence and that 's when I think I wept -- or something did . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was life itself , mine , yours , anybody 's , human experience itself , and I just happened to be there -- a kid , the kid I was then , and a man , the old man I am now . Well , for whatever it may be worth , I can still get music out of it , if I 'm awake , but I 'm not kidding myself about what that means . ( Very softly ) It 's your turn now . p. 82 WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY ( After thinking a moment , softly ) Pop ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY ( Also after thinking , also softly ) Yep . WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY I brought Mom with me . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I know that . WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY You 're not sore ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Nope . WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY I think-I think she 'd like to see you , Pop . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I think I 'd like to see her . WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY We did n't sleep on the plane . She talked the whole time-about everything , but mainly you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel a little while ago , I thought I 'd come over here and- ( He stops ) GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Well , I 'm glad you did . WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY Mom 's one of the best , Pop . Maybe the best . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I always thought so . p. 83 WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY She can live without you , Pop  --  anybody can live without anybody  --  but she does n't want to live at all  --  without you . I made her come to Paris , Pop . I told her I wanted to take her on a little holiday , that 's all . I had to promise I would n't come to see you , but the minute I got here I had to break my promise . He falls silent . Hannaberry gets up slowly , goes to him , finds him fast asleep , puts an overcoat over him , sits down , and looks at the paper again . On the other side of the stage the birds in their cages are silent , and so are the dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . In the wheelchair is Lily 's greatgrandfather , disgusted with himself for being helpless . GREATGRANDMOTHER There ! Sit and think . GREATGRANDFATHER I want to walk . GREATGRANDMOTHER Of course you do . But you ca n't . Never again . GREATGRANDFATHER Well , you 've won , have n't you ? And I 've lost . You 've got me all to yourself , at last . GREATGRANDMOTHER I 've got what 's left of you to take care of . And if that 's winning , then I 'm the winner , I suppose . p. 84 GREATGRANDFATHER ( Suddenly , almost annoyed ) Why do I have this feeling that the dogs are talking ? Does it mean I 'm dying ? GREATGRANDMOTHER Not at all . The dogs are talking . They 're always talking . Now , just sit here quietly and listen to them . ( She goes ) GREATGRANDFATHER I waited too long . I should have run away years ago . Borneo . Madagascar . Tierra del Fuego . It 's too late now . ( Suddenly ) The dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe if I become a dog , I 'll be able to hear them . FIRST DOG Well , that 's life , as they say . SECOND DOG What is , Father ? FIRST DOG Decline . Into the chair with wheels . THIRD DOG They 're going to fly one to the moon . FIRST DOG ( Deeply annoyed ) Oh , tell me , tell me all about it . THIRD DOG ( Unsuspecting ) Well , they 've got this wheelchair with a fiirecracker under the seat and an old man in it and they count backwards from ten to zero , light the firecracker , and away he goes straight to the moon . The first to do it were the Russians but the old man came back because he ran out of sandwiches . They gave him a medal and a few days later he defected to England and wrote his memoires  --  all about a Georgian girl of eleven he met in Sebastopol during the Crimean War . p. 85 FIRST DOG Oh , tell me , tell me . THIRD DOG The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be better propaganda to send a woman , to prove to the world that the Americans are n't opposed to them , except at home , in the family .  --  Quite a famous woman , too , but certainly no Joan of Arc , who of course as we know made much the same effort , on a horse . They burned her for it , but ever since there have never been less than six companies of the play on the road somewhere in the world . The American effort was a failure , too , because the woman forgot her lipstick . She got no medal , but Helena Rubinstein gave her a job on television , telling other women about Moon Kiss . FIRST DOG And what is Moon Kiss , please ? THIRD DOG Sticky paint , which they put on their mouths . FIRST DOG To keep them shut ? THIRD DOG The third to do it was the Principality of Monaco , which attached a roulette wheel over the chair , in which the oldest croupier in Monte Carlo was installed . It came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIRST DOG ( With finality and authority ) Cease ! Prince Champion Belvedere de la Gogoberidze !

FIRST DOG You have told me , told me , and I wish you had n't , had n't . THIRD DOG Nobody wants to marvel at the progress of science any more . FIRST DOG Cease ! Silence ! GREATGRANDFATHER I know they 're talking . ( At Hannaberry 's , the telephone bell starts to ring , but Hannaberry picks it up quickly , and stops it ) GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY ( Softly ) Yep . ( Listens ) O.K. , come right up , but do n't make any noise . Do n't ring or knock , just come right in . After a moment or two Leloup Rampanneau opens the door slowly , comes in , notices Wendell asleep on the floor , notices Hannaberry 's right hand out , signifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and new business in the form of papers and brochures out of his briefcase and without a word points to places here and there , signatures , sums , dates , and so on . Some of the papers are for Hannaberry to keep , and Leloup sets those aside . He also brings out half a dozen apricots , sets them on top of the papers . He eats one , and then Hannaberry eats one . Leloup does his work swiftly and efficiently , every now and and then glancing over at Wendell . Leloup asks of certain documents if Hannaberry wants to buy what is described in them . Hannaberry indicates that the does n't . At last Leloup is finished . He stuffs left-over papers back into his briefcase , and shuts it . p. 87 RAMPANNEAU ( Softly ) I come tomorrow ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY No . This is goodbye , Leloup . RAMPANNEAU Do n't say that , Monsieur . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Not so loud . RAMPANNEAU I have sold you the great house with the apricots . I have done this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to live there . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I 'm not going to live there . RAMPANNEAU No ? But you must  --  it is ready , it is waiting . The staff , the new swimming pool , the apricots on the trees . It is waiting ten days now . Come , we go now , we go together . I show you your great home . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY It 's not my home . It 's the home of Lily Dafon . RAMPANNEAU The horse ? Which I buy and put in the stable , with five other horses . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY No , Lily Dafon herself . Her mother , her grandmother , her greatgrandmother , and her greatgrandfather . ( He brings out some papers , opens them in front of Leloup ) I had my lawyer take care of all the details . You 'll find her address there , and you will oblige me by taking these papers to her . p. 88 RAMPANNEAU What for ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY They belong to her . RAMPANNEAU Why ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY No , it 's just about enough , I think . RAMPANNEAU Goodbye ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Yes , and I want to thank you , Leloup . RAMPANNEAU ( Points to his eyes ) These tears , they are real , not fake . I am crying . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Take care of yourself . RAMPANNEAU ( A sob in his voice , pointing ) Who is that down there on the floor ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY That 's me , forty years ago . RAMPANNEAU Me , too , forty years ago . I am crying , crying . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Get out of here , please . RAMPANNEAU You throw me out last time I see you instead of first time , like other people ? p. 89 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Watch that fat a little , will you ? ( Extends his hand ) RAMPANNEAU Oh , no , not like that  --  like the first time . ( Leloup demonstrates the grand American handshake . Hannaberry obliges him , Leloup almost goes to his knees again ) Like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stands , perhaps actually deeply sorrowful , nodding his head in admiration , and then he makes a gesture that says , Well , that 's how it is . And he goes . ) ( Hannaberry goes to Wendell , and stands over him . ) GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY You awake ? WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY I 've been awake ever since he came in . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Half-awake ? WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY No , wide-awake , Pop . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY How 's your hearing ? WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY Perfect , I think , but I 'll be damned if I could make heads or tails of anything you said . He 's a race-track tout , is n't he ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Yes , he is . He 's been dropping by every morning for about a month . p. 90 WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY Did he give you any winners ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY One , but then I did n't play the others . I only pretended I did , so he would n't feel useless . He 's a fat man , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you take a shower , and then get some real sleep ? WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY ( Getting up ) No , I ca n't sleep any more . Just those few minutes I needed  - -  here . You want me to go back to the hotel , and wait , or what ? We 're on the other side of town , because  --  well , Mom , did n't want to crowd you . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY What hotel is it ? WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY The Ritz . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I go there a lot  --  to the bar , especially . Suppose I 'm in there early this evening ? Do you think you could get her to step in , without too much trouble ? WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY I can try . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY You give it a try , will you , Wendell ? WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY Yeah , I 'll think of something . Are you sure you want me to , Pop ? I mean , just because I came here does n't mean you 've got to change your whole way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HANNABERRY No , I want to have a drink with Daisy . In Paris . WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY And then ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Maybe another drink . WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY Do you think we might all go back to Texas together ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY We might , but I do n't know . WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY I want to go on to London . I mean , as soon as  --  I mean , if  --  GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Well , maybe you can do that , Wendell . WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY Pop ? ( Pause ) Do n't do anything you do n't really want to . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I wo n't . WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY Because it 's no good  --  for her , I mean . More of this would be better than that , Pop . I do n't know if you 've had a bad time , but I know she has . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I 've had the best time of my life , but let me tell you something , Wendell , and try to understand , if you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  deep inside . Both , at the same time . p. 92 WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY And now ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY And now I want to see if Daisy and I can have a drink . Hell , if we ca n't , we just ca n't , that 's all , and we can be friends . We can at least try to be friends . WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY You ought to be able to have a drink with her now . You 're more easy-going . Now , it 's Warren , the way you used to be  --  all work , all the time . Even when it is n't work , it is work . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Ah , that 's too bad . WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY He loves it . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY That 's what I mean . WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY You 're more  --  well , I do n't know what to call it . Intelligent ? No , that 's not it . I guess the only thing you can call it is courteous . I never before knew it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners  --  training . You 've got real courtesy , Pop . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Well , it 's about time . WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY The Ritz Bar , around seven ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Do you think you might be able to make it by six ? p. 93 WENDELL WILLKIE HANNABERRY I 'll try . So long , Pop . ( Wendell goes . Hannaberry goes to the telephone . ) GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Operator , will you get me the Porter , please . ( He waits a moment ) Porter , this is George Hannaberry . I want two tickets to New York , any flight after ten or eleven tonight . And send up a boy to pack my bags , will you ? In the meantime , on the other side of the stage Lily Dafon 's greatgrandmother has wheeled Lily 's greatgrandfather out of the room , and Lily has come there , to play the harp softly . Now , she stops , goes to the telephone , and dials . Hannaberry 's telephone bell rings . He lifts the receiver and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , but I forgot it until just this minute . Shall we have lunch , so I can tell you all about it ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I 'd love to have lunch , but I am afraid I ca n't make it . DAFON ( Long drawn out , like a pout ) Oh ? ( Pause ) Dinner ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I 'm afraid I ca n't make dinner , either . DAFON Oh ? ( Pause ) Lunch tomorrow ? Maybe I 'll be able to remember the dream until lunch tomorrow . p. 94 GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Forget it . DAFON Why ? It 's the most beautiful dream I ever dreamed . I had all the things I 've always wanted , the things I told you about that night at the theatre . But in my dream I did n't know where they were from , or why I had them . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Lily , I 'm going back to Texas . DAFON When ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Tonight . DAFON But why ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I had a dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with everybody . Always dreaming . You 'll be back in a few days of course , wo n't you ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Well , not exactly in a few days . DAFON Take me with you . Get me away from all these old women in this horrible old house . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY No , Lily , that 's George Murat-Dufour 's job . DAFON Somebody has given him the most marvelous commission of his life . He is going to build  --  not re-design  --  he is going to build  --  you 'll never guess what . A lunatic asylum . Private , so of course it 's not called that . He 's rich , and he 's so excited and confused he woke me up at three this morning to tell me how he 's going to make that lunatic asylum so wonderful , it 's going to be harder to get into than the French Academy . At half-past four this morning he asked me to be his wife . An hour and a half about the lunatic asylum , and ten seconds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WASHINGTON HANNABERRY Congratulations , Lily . When ? DAFON Tomorrow , but I 'll put it off if you 'll have lunch . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY You get married , you can always have lunch . DAFON I 'll come straight to the hotel for a goodbye kiss . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY No , Lily . DAFON Then , you come here . GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I ca n't . Do n't tell any of the others I 'm leaving , will you ? Goodbye , Lily . DAFON Goodbye . ( She is actually crying ) I love you , I will always love you , take care of yourself , be careful of the Indians in Texas , and the rattlesnakes , and the juvenile delinquents , I do n't want anything in this world to hurt you , love me , love me , always love me , will you ? Will you promise to love me , always , and never , never forget me , even a little , because if you do I will die instantly , and never know why . I love you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this life is foolish and impossible . I ca n't speak any more . Promise , promise ? GEORGE WASHINGTON HANNABERRY I promise . DAFON Goodbye , my darling . Goodbye , till we meet again . And I know we will meet again . We will . Somewhere . At the casino in Monte Carlo or in another world . Goodbye . She hangs up and sobs uncontrollably , although God knows why . And let no human being presume to be better at that sort of thing than God . She turns and runs upstairs to her own room suddenly . After a moment the doorbell rings , and Lily 's greatgrandmother goes to the door , opens it , and lets in Leloup Rampanneau instantly . They are obviously not strangers . p. 96 GREATGRANDMOTHER Well ? RAMPANNEAU Everything . More than everything . In perfect order . GREATGRANDMOTHER Very well , then . Please sit down . ( She stamps her cane , and calls ) Lily ? Lily ? DAFON ( Almost finished sobbing ) Yes ? What is it ? GREATGRANDMOTHER Somebody to see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your name , Monsieur ? RAMPANNEAU Leloup Rampanneau . GREATGRANDMOTHER Leloup Rampanneau . DAFON I do n't know any Leloup Rampanneau . Please send him away . GREATGRANDMOTHER What is the purpose of your call , Monsieur ? RAMPANNEAU It is confidential , Madame . For Miss Lily Dafon alone . GREATGRANDMOTHER Lily . I think you 'd better come down and receive the gentleman . ( After a moment Lily comes in ) Monsieur Rampanneau , this is Miss Lily Dafon . And now if you will excuse me , I have my unfortunate husband to look after . ( She goes ) p. 97 RAMPANNEAU Miss Dafon , I have been sent to you by Mr. George Hannaberry of Dallas , Texas , with these papers , which explain themselves . ( He spreads the papers out ) You are the sole and exclusive owner of all of this  --  a gift from Mr. Hannaberry . I acted as his agent , for which I have been more than amply rewarded by him . Your car and chauffeur is at the door . Goodbye , Miss Dafon . DAFON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is terribly excited and pleased , but at the same time there is a hint of checking up on everything , in her running through the papers . She runs to the telephone , dials , and waits . Hannabery , in the meantime , has begun to play the harmonica very softly  --  his own stuff . The telephone bell rings again and again , but Hannaberry does n't stir , and finally Lily hangs up . DAFON Mama ! Grandmama ! Greatgrandmama ! Greatgrandpapa ! ( She stuffs all of the papers into her handbag , and one by one the other members of the family come in . ) ALL What is it , Lily ? DAFON We 're going for a drive to the country , where I have a surprise for each of you . Greatgrandpapa will sit up front with the chauffeur . MOTHER What chauffeur ? p. 98 DAFON That 's part of the surprise , Mama . And his wheelchair will be placed in the trunk compartment , so that he can enjoy the country , too . GRANDMOTHER I do n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move along and get in the limousine , as Lily says ? Lily 's grandmother wheels out the old man , followed by Lily 's mother . Her greatgrandmother looks at her with great love and admiration . She embraces Lily , and goes out . Lily stands alone in the room , for a good long last look . The bird in the cage near the door is looking straight at her , almost suspiciously . Lily looks the bird straight in the eye , and winks . Then she goes on out .
