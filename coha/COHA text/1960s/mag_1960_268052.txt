THE CHESS PLAYERS ( 533 pp. ) - Frances Parkinson Keyes - Farrar , Straus &; Cudahy ( $4.95 ) . <P> <P> The ultimate in barbiturate prose is the point at which tedium becomes coma , and perennially bestselling Author Keyes may have reached this point in The Chess Players . Her great sedative skill can be appreciated only when it is understood that her material , as such , is fascinating . The novel is set in New Orleans and Paris in the 1850s and ' 60s , contains an amorous princess , various spies and diplomats , a slave auctioneer , lovely Creole maidens , and splendidly uniformed military personnel . The hero is a brilliant , brooding fellow who becomes the world chess champion and then chucks it all for love of a faithless woman . <P> The author has not troubled herself to invent this chess master . Paul Morphy , the only world champion at chess the U.S. has produced , was born in New Orleans in 1837 . At ten , he began beating the best players in Louisiana , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A year later he abandoned chess , possibly because the girl he hoped to marry scorned the game . Morphy , as Novelist Keyes resurrects him , is a colorless weakling , whose intellect , despite the fact that everyone thinks him brilliant , is an unfavorable blend of compoop and nincompoop . <P> As Morphy 's shade wavers through a series of chess triumphs ( actual ) and a career as a Confederate agent in Paris ( imagined ) , the reader notices a few things about the Keyes technique . There are no purple patches-only grey ones- and there are no onstage sword fights or seductions . Novelist Keyes 's strong point is research , and where Frank Yerby or Taylor Caldwell might liven the soggy chapter by unhooking the heroine 's bodice , Morphy 's chronicler merely recreates a chess game . While it is open to question how much the author knows about chess , the royal game , it is clear that she is a master of Authors , the game of royalties.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
