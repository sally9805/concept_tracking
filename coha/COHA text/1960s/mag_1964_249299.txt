Nationality seems to make no difference at all . " Ga-ga-GAAK , ga-ga-GAAK " means the same thing to a Russian Orloff rooster , an Italian Leghorn , a Cornish cock or a New Hampshire Red . At the sound of the excited cackling , prudent poultry the world over get the same message : " Watch out ! Danger ! " <P> Dr. Erich Baeumer , the country physician from Wiedenau , Germany , who translated the warning into people talk , insists that all chickens speak an international language made up of 30 basic sentences . And as a fowl linguist , the portly G.P. speaks with considerable authority . He has been studying the birds for nearly 60 years . <P> Young Erich was eight when his mother made him play in the chicken yard to keep him out of the road . " It was an intuitive understanding , " he remembers with surprise . " I could actually tell what they were saying . I began to spend hours with them ; they became brothers and sisters to me . " He learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a full-fledged member of the flock . Only when his voice changed did the chickens realize that he was not really one of them . <P> My Son the Rooster . All through his student years , Baeumer kept chummy with chickens ; when he started medical practice in rural Wiedenau , he turned his garden into a chicken yard . He spent all his spare moments there , communing with the inmates , observing their language and customs . Sometimes he incubated a clutch of eggs and kept the chicks isolated so that they accepted him as their mother and apparently thought other humans were just big chickens . He listened carefully while their baby peeps changed to adult chicken language , and found that it came from instinct and never varied appreciably . Roosters raised in isolation from other chickens always crow correctly without learning how ; isolated hens make correct clucking noises as soon as they feel ready to brood . <P> In 1954 the absorbing hobby became scientific research . The late Professor Erich von Hoist was experimenting with chickens at the Institute of Behavior Physiology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chickens intimately . Von Hoist was so impressed with the country doctor 's chicken lore that he started him on an orgy of photography and tape recording . <P> After recording hours of chicken talk , Dr. Baeumer would play the tapes back , selecting examples of clear-cut chicken " sentences " that could be related to records or photographs of specific actions . Collecting prime examples of all the basic sentences took about four years . Best performers were breeds with strains of gamecock in them . " Chickens with fighting blood , " says Dr. Baeumer , " are better because they have more temperament . "
