NATION <P> The struggle that has been building between moderate and radical elements in the U.S. civil rights movement last week broke bitterly into the open . Standing at a crossroads where one signpost beckons with the ringing and controversial slogan " Black power ! " ( TIME , July 1 ) , the movement dramatically aired its deep division in national meetings of its two biggest organizations . In Los Angeles , the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , the largest , the oldest and the strongest civil rights group , met to renew its dedication to moderation and responsibility . In Baltimore gathered the Congress of Racial Equality ( CORE ) , the biggest among a new grouping of black-power organizations that equate moderation with stagnation and demand far more militancy . In the wide gulf between them lurked the threat that the movement may be violently wrenched apart . <P> What transpired at both meetings so shook the Negro civil rights movement that Dr. Martin Luther King , the best known and most popular of the rights leaders , felt obliged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to a permanent split over the issue of black power , urged civil rights leaders to patch up their differences before it is too late . <P> As for the leaders of the militants , they clearly saw the crisis as an opportunity to try to seize the leadership of the movement from the moderates . Said Floyd McKissick , the leader of CORE : " The civil rights movement in 1966 has reached the moment of truth , and Negro leaders are not telling it to you like it is . " <P> " Stop Messing with Me . " Suspecting that CORE would take the black-power route at its convention , the Big Three of moderate civil rights organizations-the N.A.A.C.P. , the National Urban League and King 's Southern Christian Leadership Conference-boycotted the sessions . Their fears were confirmed . For the first time in CORE 's history , the Black Muslims and other extreme Ne gro nationalists were not only permitted to share the platform but were favorably mentioned by the convention 's leaders . The hall rang with chants of " Black power ! Black power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nun , who was among the relatively few whites present : " This is the Congress for Racial Superiority . "
