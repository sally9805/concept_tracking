txt Gen. of the Army Dwight , D. Eisenhower is finding out the hard way that private life in retirement is not all he thought it would be ? not yet , anyway . The transition from Commander in Chief to country squire does not happen quickly or painlessly . Problems of daily living have replaced the old anxieties that were a part of White House routine . But w:ji the anxieties have gone the hundred and one conveniences that any President soon learns to take for granted . The former President has notl yet had to buy his own railroad or airplane ticket . But there are no more private limousines , jet airliners or helicopters at his beck and call . Two household servants and half a dozen office helpers have replaced the regiments of aides , assistants , secretaries , ushers , valets and foot- men ; as well as the solicitous Secret Service agents . General Eisenhower had looked forward to the little challenges of " doing for myself " what others , uninstructed , used to do . He was as happy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own car , even though it meant learning all over again on a modern automobile , Then in Friday 's . mail came his beginner 's permit with instructions that he must be accompanied at all times by an experienced driver . The same day , he received fifteen telephone calls from insurance salesmen of personal liability policies . He began to worry a bit about himself  --  and others too . Through long years of riding behind uniformed or liveried chauffeurs , he acquired a habit of using the time to meditate or think through some vexing problem . " Suppose I start that:kind of business while driving through Gettysburg with all its traffic lights . or while barreling down the highway , " General Eisenhower pondered audibly to a friend . " It might only be a question whether I end up in jail or the hospital and there 's the other guy to think about , too . " Those around him are hoping that the general will drive self home from the office just once and then give up the idea , Meanwhile , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for himself . Except for the many conveniences with which he was formerly surrounded , Dwight D. Eiesnhower 's living habits are little changed from his day at the White House , at Columbia University or as commander of Supreme Headquarters Allied Forces Europe . Still Plenty of Work The big difference is that , while his work load is surprisingly about as heavy as ever , it has not the awesome responsibility of old . Also , he is now spared the incessant round of ceremonies , including state dinners and other official functions that begin for the man in the White House when the General 's day 's work is done . So General Eisenhower now gets to bed around 10 o'clock instead of 11 or a little later , as formerly. , He does not sleep as well or as long as he used to and can not stay abed while awake . But he thinks this isi just part of the adjustment . Sometimes after five hours of sleep , he explains , something rings a bell in his head and he has to get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on the hour . If the bell does not ring lie is up at 6:45 but once in a while it will be 5:45 . At that hour he . will dress quietly so as not to disturb Mrs. Eisenhower and then go downstairs to read whatever is handy until the morning papers arrive . The Moneys , Sgt. John and his wife Eleanor , will have been up since six o'clock so the General has not long to wait for his breakfast . Sergeant Mooney , who has been with him since 1942 , is General Eisenhower 's valet but the General still dresses himself except on those rare occasions now when he wears evening clothes . After breakfasting , usually on orange juice , a small beef filet and toast , General Eisen- hower leaves the farm in one , of the two Eisenhower cars . He is driven by his herdsman , Bob Hartley , or occasionally by , his son , Lieut . Col. John S. D. , Eisenhower , no won leave from ' , the Army without pay . House Private Papers He arrives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm , about 7:45 . The office , the former residence of Gettysburg College presidents , is at 300 Carlisle Street . It is a twostory red brick residence but much newer than its neighbors . It houses those private papers of the former President that have not been turned over to the Federal Government and is as tightly secure as a bank . Just above the front doorbell , there is an electrical communication system . By this , the caller is asked his business . Many have said they just wanted " to make the tour . " as they had done at the White House . This is a delicate point with those who now work with the former President . They believe that people have a right to see an office supported by public funds . But the building is a small one , and work would have to stop while it was being inspected . Usually , the tourists are told politely that the tours have not yet been arranged . A quiet efficiency pervades the four converted bedrooms , which serve as the general 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his three staff aides . One room is shared by Mrs. Ann C. Whitman , his executive assistant , and Mrs. Helen North , who has temporarily resumed her duties with the general after a fouryear absence . A second office across the hall from the former President is occupied by Col. Robert Schulz , former White House military aide who , like Mrs. North , goes back to General Eisenhower 's tour of duty at SHAFE . Colonel Eisenhower has his office on the ground floor , which also contains a dining room , kitchen and a more spacious sitting room for conferences . The Eisenhower office , with its blue wall-to-wall carpet and off-white walls and ceilings , is well appointed , but a visitor feels it odd when he sees the general behind the single mahogany desk . The office is obviously ample for his purposes , with two or three occasional chairs for visitors . But it seems dwarfed by the nervous energy that its occupant generates these days . His correspondence is prodigious . He dictates by the hour on the book he is preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when talking with a visitor , the General frequently shifts positions in the big leather swivel chair . He crosses and uncrosses his legs and will get to his feet and pace the room because he can- not properly emphasise what he ' has to say while seated . He will follow his visitor out into the hallway and then poke his head into Mrs. Whitman 's , office to ask , " What 's next ? " It is the same with corre-1 spondence . He will dictate re plies to letters for two hours or tell Mrs. how to answer for is signature , and then inquire : " What was that other thing I was supposed to do today ? " Overall , General Eisenhower appears to be a man with a lot to do and not enough time to do it . Usually he leaves the office at noon for the farm and a light lunch . Then , he has a short nap or rests lying down , 1 with eyes closed . He can pop off in fifteen seconds , for all his trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he goes back to the office about 2.30 for more work , punctuated at times by some serious reading . At present he is searching the house and office for William Ernest Hocking 's " The Strength of Men and Nations . " He read it going and coming from Europe in 1959 and he made copious marginal notes on it . An average day will find the former President leaving his office about 5 P. M. or a little earlier . Not until daylight saving time came in did he find time to look over the farm or visit the breeding barn . He now does the tour several times a week before dinner about 7 o'clock , but the farm and the stock could hardly be called an absorbing preoccupation for him . Soon after he left the Pres-1 idency on Jan. 20 , General Eisenhower became the elder statesman of the Republican ' party and its most cherished ) spokesman . He also became the pater families of many young men and women who believe that if they ask his advice he will try to answer them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest single category of Eisenhower mail . A second category , nearly as large , could be labeled " politics . " A. third has to do with the military and his long career in its service . But the biggest problem for the former President and his staff these days develops with the large number of requests for him to participate in dedicating schools or other buildings or to " say a few words " to some group touring the battlefield . Nearly a million tourists Visit Gettysburg every year . Many groups have tour directors who " just know " that their trip would be made a big success if General Eisenhower would " just say a few words . " The trouble is that , as in the case of those seeking advice , every wellintentioned appeal seems to merit a personal reply . Happily for the President , it does not work out that way because his staff has learned over the years the sort of appeals that he need not hear about . General Eisenhower now understands this , but he has been careful not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screening . Part of his burdens these days stems fraom his determination to be the " good neighbor " he promised his fellow townsmen he would be . Thus neither bar rier nor police guards the private entrance to his country estate . The private property line is as obvious as the two stone pillars marking the entrance to the private driveway that winds some three hundred yards to the house . Tourists , however , appear to think the lawns and fields are public property like the Mall in Washington . Consequently , the seven employes who run the farm and tend the stock have been spending almost as much time removing litter and replacing trampled sod as on their regular chores . In such circumstances most retired private citizens would say " call the police . " General , Eisenhower need do only that to put the place under constant surveillance of the State Highway Patrol . But in addition to being a private citizen and a good neighbor , General Eisenhower knows he is also a former President of the United States . And if former Presidents are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one does not think he should have to ask for it . And so the tourists that scramble and litter his lawn have become a part of the sometime painful transition to the private life of a country squire .
