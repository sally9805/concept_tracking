Though the U.S. weather satellite Tiros I still circles the earth every 99 minutes , it is electronically dead . Yet during its active life of 78 days , Tiros I transmitted 22,952 cloud-cover pictures that still keep meteorologists in a state of round-eyed euphoria . Never before had earthmen seen so sweeping a view of their planet 's splotchy atmosphere . <P> Last week Meteorologist David Johnson of the U.S. Weather Bureau told how Tiros ' twin TV cameras , riding 400 miles up , saw things no one had noticed before-and gave a new dimension to the not-so-precise science of meteorology . Until Tiros , the story of what happens overhead had been a matter of educated guesswork , a smattering of facts well-larded with interpolation . Only a few areas ( Europe , parts of the U.S. , Japan ) have tight networks of weather observation posts , and even these can only monitor a relatively small patch of weather . A ground observer can see cloud effects about five miles away . If he has radar , he can report heavy rain at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see only 150 miles . Between the observers are wide-open spaces big enough to hold whole strings of tornadoes . Some 80% of the earth 's surface has no reporting stations at all . In many unfrequented parts of the ocean , a hurricane can be born and grow to adulthood in perfect privacy . <P> Patterns &; Shapes . During its electronic lifetime , Tiros I photographed away much of the atmosphere 's privacy . On May 19 , for instance , the camera pictured a bright , square cloud in an isolated position about 50 miles northwest of Wichita Falls , Texas ( see cut ) . Weathermen had no previous reports of such a formation . They looked up the records and found that this peculiar cloud had moved northeastward and raked Oklahoma with four tornadoes . When future weather satellites take to space , one mission will be to watch for clouds of this sort and warn against them before they start doing damage . <P> The Air Force 's Air Weather Service considers even relatively harmless clouds important because they may hamper military operations . Aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targets , the airmen would like a precise picture of the weather en route in all missions . The aerial refueling of bombers requires clear , smooth air , and the all-seeing eyes of Tiros can tell bombers and tankers where to make their rendezvous . <P> Clouds also show by their patterns and shapes what motions of atmosphere are stirring up the weather . Tiros I took pictures of spiraling cloud systems reaching from Alaska to Southern California . Over Argentina , it showed clouds that traced the location of the high-altitude jet stream of the Southern Hemisphere . Meteorologists were surprised to learn from Tiros I that great , swirling cyclonic systems thousands of miles apart are sometimes connected by filaments of cloud . <P> Neph Analysis . The operational successors of Tiros I will probably revive a 19th century method of weather prediction called " neph analysis " ( nephos-Greek for cloud ) . Weathermen in Antarctica will welcome satellite cloud pictures to tell them whether it is safe for a supply plane to start from New Zealand .
