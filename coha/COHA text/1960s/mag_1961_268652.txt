After four months of tense anticipation by the aerospace industry , Washington last week chose a contractor for the nation 's largest space project yet . To start work on the Apollo spacecraft , which is to carry three men to the moon and back , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration gave a $400 million initial order to Los Angeles ' North American Aviation . <P> Though less well known to the public than many of its competitors ( largely because no airliners carry its name ) , thrusting North American is the fourth biggest of aerospace companies , outranked only by General Dynamics , Boeing and Lockheed . In its annual report last week . North American reported sales of $1.3 billion for the business year ending Sept. 30 , and profits of $27,750,000 . By winning the Apollo contract-on which the Government plans to spend an estimated $20 billion during the next ten years-North American should in time push its sales close to the $2 billion mark . <P> Famine 's Lesson . North American boasts that it leads all its competitors in total number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. long-range fighter in World War II . And it was North American 's F-86 , the U.S. Air Force 's first swept-wing fighter , that kept Russian MIGs from gaining mastery of the Korean skies . <P> North American 's skill at building military aircraft did it little direct good when , in the postwar famine for planemakers , its backlog of orders was cut from 8,000 planes to 24 . But the high-powered research establishment and alert management that served it so well in the airframe business enabled the company to launch , quicker than most of its competitors , a crash diversification program . Today , with only 38% of its sales in aircraft , North American consists of six scientifically oriented divisions , each so large that it has its own president . The divisions : <P> AUTONETICS , whose 1961 sales of $410 million place it among the nation 's top ten electronics companies . Its specialty : inertial-navigation systems , one of which steered the nuclear submarines Nautilus and Skate under the polar icecap . <P> ROCKETDYNE , which has produced the engines powering about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project : developing the Saturn and Nova clustered rockets to loft huge spacecraft on interplanetary jaunts . <P> COLUMBUS ( Ohio ) DIVISION makes the sleek Vigilante , the Navy 's Mach 2 carrier-based bomber . <P> LOS ANGELES DIVISION built the X-15 rocket plane that has carried man in controlled flight higher ( 41 miles ) and faster ( 4,093 m.p.h. ) than ever before . <P> ATOMICS INTERNATIONAL is perfecting compact nuclear reactors to provide electricity in space vehicles . <P> SPACE &; INFORMATION SYSTEMS will have the prime responsibility for the Apollo , will probably be assisted by four Mercury-seasoned subcontractors : Northrop ( recovery system ) , AiResearch Manufacturing ( environmental control within the capsule ) , Minneapolis-Honeywell ( flight control ) , and Collins Radio ( space-to-base communications ) .
