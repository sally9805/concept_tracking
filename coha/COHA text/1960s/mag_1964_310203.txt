The nation 's most carefully watched economic indicator-the Bureau of Labor Statistics ' cost of living index , to which the wages of 2.5 million U.S. workers are tied-will appear this week in a new statistical form . It has undergone the first major changes in a decade , to make it better reflect the expenses incurred by a modern family . <P> Some 75 new items are included in the revised 400-item index , as a result of a survey of 12,000 families in 66 cities . Among the new items : funeral costs , home-and auto-finance charges , hotel-motel rates , snack prices , parking fees , college tuitions , and the prices of textbooks , magazines and paperback books . Among the prices that have been dropped are those for such items as rolled oats , men 's work gloves and lemons , which have become less significant in the family budget of the 1960s . <P> The Bureau of Labor Statistics has assigned different values to the food , housing , transportation and service sections of the index to get a more accurate reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less important than in the existing index , and housing and transportation relatively more so . With the first sniff of inflation in the air , a key question is whether the new index , with its heavier emphasis on services , will rise faster than the old one , which has crept up 1.2% annually since 1961.
