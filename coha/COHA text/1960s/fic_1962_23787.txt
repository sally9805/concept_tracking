PAUL LOVES LIBBY By PHILIP ROTH p AuL HERZ had uncles who had failed . He had a father who had failed too , but that was in the world of commerce . ' Mr. Herz bought and sold with little talent and saved where interest amounted to pennies ; when he finally emerged from his fourth failure  --  this last in frozen foods  --  he had nothing to show for himself save a sinus condition and holy dread of heart failure . He took to melting Vicks under his nose in a spoon and arranged for a small hank loan so as to purchase , for his heart 's ease , a BarcaLounger  --  and then he settled down to wait for the end . Still , there his linens were in . One foul snowy evening she had seen her baby brother emerge from Riker 's with a toothpick in his mouth . Riker 's ! For an Asher ! She had cried herself to sleep for a week . Asher had begun lite a genius , having played Mozart at about the same age Mozart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received free tuition to pose life models at the Art Students League ; he was allowed to touch and arrange their bare limbs , so advanced for his years was his sense of grace . When he brought home his charcoal drawings they were tacked up in the living-room . " You do n't even think dirty when you look at such pictures , " Asher 's mother had reassured the neighbors . " Look how artistic he makes those fat girls . " A piano was brought into the house for Asher , later a violin and a cello . He spent a summer in the Louvre , copying ; he did his first commissioned portrait at eighteen  --  the captain of the Mauritania ! But that captain was long dead , and others had come and gone , and no girl had ever married Asher . What his sister and brother-in-law decided was that it was necessary to put a young lady in Asher 's path . They invited him to dinner , and they invited a secretary from Mr. Herz 's office ; they invited schoolteachers , colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was in town , and once even  --  for who knows finally what goes on in the head of an artist  --  once they even tried ( all the dead should rest in peace ) a shiksa , but a girl who hung around with Jews . They turned on the radio but Asher would n't dance . They brought out the cards but Asher would n't play . How could you put a girl in this fellow 's path  --  he had no path ! The other flop was Uncle Jerry . He had married , but only for twenty-five years . A quarter of a century with a woman and then he divorces her . Who could feel sorry for him ? A beautiful twelve-room house in Great Neck with grass all around and a pine-paneled basement ; four beautiful daughters with beautiful builds  --  one married , two in college , and the fourth , Claire , the little shaifele , still in high school ; and for a wife , a wonderful woman , a princess , a queen . So what if she weighed one-eighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he roll her out twenty-five years after the wedding night because she was still making the same dent in the mattress now as then ? Who could feel any sorrow for him ! Why , why did he do it ? Did he have some tootsie on the side ? No , no  --  it was his what-do-you-call-it , his psychoanalysis ! his psychoanalyst made him do it . That son of a bitch . What did that guy think life was , easy ? A bowl of cherries ? You love your wife , you do n't love her ; you fondle her , you ca n't stand to touch her ? that happens ! Does that ? mean you destroy a family ? When a father dies it 's a catastrophe . Here 's a man who walks out ! Two years after he walked out , Jerry married a twenty-seven-year-old . She was just what everybody had been looking for for Asher for years . " What 's he doing ? Another big woman  --  what 's the matter with him ? A **27;1790;TOOLONG he thinking about ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... What kind of business is this ! " " Then call him , Leonard . Stop getting upset and call him , Talk to him . He 's your brother . " " Letting Go " ? Philip Roth 's first novel , from which " Paul Loves Libby " is taken  --  will be published later this month by Random House . His first book , " Goodbye , Columbus , " won the National Book Award for 1960 . Born in Newark , New Jersey , in 1933 , he has an M.A. from Chicago , and is now teaching in the Writer 's Workshop of the University of Iowa . " It 's his life . Let him ruin it . Would he call me ? if l had a seizure tomorrow , would he so much as lift the phone off the hook ? " " Your heart is perfectly all right . The doctor listened to it . He checked everything . They have graphs , Leonard , that show . You 've got a nice even line . Do n't get overexcited because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overexcited . I 'm practically lying down . He could marry a ten-year-old and I would n't turn a pinky . I told him when he married Selma , did n't I ? Jerry , you 're wet behind the ears . Jerry , you never even had a woman yet . Jerry , give yourself a chance . Jerry this , Jerry that , Jerry she 's a very big girl , Jerry  --  is that what you want ? Anti now this one , also a horse . Why does n't he at least call me , ask my advice ? No , him he 's smarter than the rest of the world . " Three weeks later ( " to the day " as it later came to he reported ) the girl telephoned . " He left ! Your brother left ! He walked out ! What did I do ! What will I do ! All this new silverware , " she cried . " Please come somebody . Help me ! " " Leonard , where are you going in your slippers ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is he a nut ? " " Leonard , do n't get involved now . " " I am involved . The telephone rings , this girl is hysterical , I 'm involved . She 's a baby  --  she 'll do something insane . How do I know ? " When Mr. Herz went out the door his wife grew hysterical herself . She knelt beside the BarcaLounger and wept into the still warm leather . Who knew best whether a man 's heart is weak  --  the doctor or the man himself ? How could a machine tell a man he did n't have pains ? In the night he could n't even roll over , his ribs were so sore . And one morning ( she with herself ) she would wake up and he would n't . Oh Cod ! God ! He would get overexcited , involved , wrought up  --  and die ! Finally she pulled herself to the telephone and looked up the analyst 's name . She dialed , and when she had him on the phone , she cried , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life , you son of a bitch ! She had everything and you ruined it ! What kind of ideas do you put in people 's heads ! What is he  --  a boy ? A man fifty-two years old and he marries girls , children ! You quack , you fraud ? " Y E T when their son Paul came down one Christmas from Cornell to drop the name Libby DeWitt into their lap , it was to Asher and Jerry that , they referred him . Tears flowed from his parents for two reasons : there was grief over his marital decision , and grief too at their own impotence . They had somehow reared a boy whom they could not bludgeon or make hysterical . By way of ruination , selfishness , and stupidity , Jerry and Asher seemed better equipped to deal with the disaster . There even seemed to the parents to be some affinity between the boy and his uncles  --  which was yet a third reason for tears . " I let him down , " wept the father in bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to me . In my own house my voice do n't carry from the kitchen to the toilet . All his life the boy has been filling in applications . You lift up a piece of paper in this house and underneath 's an application . When did I ever sec him ? When did he learn to listen to a father ? He was always running out to get somebody to recommend him for something . A waiter in the mountains , a stock boy , a scholarship student . Once he should listen to me . Just once . " Paul 's mother was crying too ; she attempted a slight change of subject . " A scholarship is an honor , " she sobbed , touching her husband 's wet face . " We should be proud ? " " It 's an honor for the son , not for me . Just once , once .. Five years later and frozen foods was already a craze . This man Birdseye is coining it , and my son , my son ... A Catholic the girl is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't had a healthy day in her life ? " " My baby , " his mother wept . " He could read the mileage off the speedometer before other kids could even talk . What 's happening to my baby ? " W H E N Asher called to invite Paul for a walk , Paul saw no need to be rude to someone essentially an outsider in the whole affair . He went with Asher because he knew his parents had asked Asher to phone . He went to make it easier on Asher , who like himself must have felt obliged to comply with whatever sad maneuverings Paul 's helpless parents could devise . He went for the sake of everybody 's dignity . It happened also that he knew that Asher would be sympathetic , or at the least , noncommittal . The values of a man who had studied art in New York , in Chicago , in Europe , who had composed music , who chose to live in a loft over a Third Avenue bar  --  these were not the values of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ; an eccentric perhaps , but free . The day they met was windless and cold . They walked side by side , two scrawny bareheaded men , one bald , the other with kinky black ridges beginning only two fingers up from his eyebrows . One rounded his shoulders to stay warm , the other had had round shoulders for years . His misshapen lobes made his ears look like accidents ; on top of that , hair grew out of them . Asher slid not seem to believe that outside the skin there were things to be taken care of . A full day of barbers , tailors , shoemakers , cleaners , and opticians would just about begin to put him in order . His spectacles , for instance , were a little storage-bin of paper clips and Scotch tape . None of this run-downness depressed Paul , however , He leaned closer to catch the soft , whispery words his uncle spoke , while overhead the El trains broke metallically through the cold steely air . Asher turned his head in the raised collar of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old are you , Paulie ? " " Twenty-one . " Asher made a face , as though he 'd eaten something unpalatable . " So what 's your hurry ? " " What hurry ? Hurry for what ? " " You have a nice sweet life ahead of you , is n't that a fact ? " Where was this conversation drifting ? " But I 'm in love , " said Paul , shrugging . " Let 's get out frog this noise , and talk , " Asher said , and they crossed the street , Asher taking Paul by the elbow . He pulled his nephew close to him and with a sleepy closing of his swollen eyes back of the tortured glasses , he said , " I 'm in love myself . " " Yes ? " " Absolutely . " " I did n't know that , " Paul said , trying to remain composed . " Sure . She comes to my studio every Wednesday afternoon . Today  --  this afternoon . ft gets dark and she goes home . A girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be remembered from the dim past . Though he did not want to , Paul suspected his uncle of lying . " Is she married ? " Paul asked . " I know her four years , and every Wednesday . the most valuable thing in my life . . . She 's married , sure . She has a baby . " Asher took a frayed billfold from his coat and handed Paul a picture of a little girl . " A darling , " Asher said . " She 's very nice . " " A darling child , " Asher said . He stuffed the billfold back inside his coat . " Look , Paulie , I 've loved a lot of women . Six years 1 lived with a Chinese woman , for example . Many different types and personalities . I 've had all kinds , had every imaginable variety of nookie . I 'm no amateur at this business . " " I did n't know that . " " What ? What didn't. you know ? " " For instance , the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make a point of it with your mother . I think she has a prejudice against non-Occidentals . " " That 's giving her a break , but that 's true . " " Is she pregnant ? " Asher suddenly asked . This girl ? I 'm trying to get to your motivation . " " Are we talki.ig about me now ? " " About your girl friend , " Asher said . " What 's the story , Paulie ? " " My father told you she must be pregnant , is that it ? Do n't you think that shows how he does n't begin to understand ? " " Do n't worry about his understanding . Of course he 's a dope . You did n't knock her up ? " " She 's not intact , but she 's either . " " She 's not intact by you or before you ? " " By me . " " Oh it dears up . And for that you 're throwing out all your opportunities ? For that small puncture you 'll tie yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Asher , what are you talking about ? " " Money . Life . " " You sound like my old man . " " You have n't got good ears  --  I 'm at the other end of the globe . I understand she 's a little sickly . " " Oh Christ . She gets colds , Asher . They met her twice and both times she had colds . It 's winter . She 's human ? " " Even nose drops cost money , " Asher was explaining . " Kleenex can run you into a fortune , I mean paupers like you and me . You want to tie a stone around ' our neck ? " Asher asked . " You 'll fall in love all your life , in and out all your life ? you can even find a lady with a wooden leg , I do n't care . It is n't the colds , Paulie , it 's the principle . You 're twenty-one , you drew a little blood from her , so you think there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got no obligations according to the date of entry , you understand me ? If it was n't you it would be another smart fellow . Do n't bind yourself round for having a little fun . Is it you who wants to marry or is it this girl ? " " We both want to . We arrived at the decision mutually . " He made no effort to hide his anger . " Which more mutually than the other ? " " Mutually mutually ! " " And how old is she that she 's so in tune with you and life ? " " Nineteen . " " Nineteen and a Catholic . Splendid . " " Asher , I did n't expect this from you . " " So what am I supposed to do ? Tell lies ? You only take walks with right-minded people ? " " You can disagree , but why on this level ? " Paul demanded . " What level ? You tell me you like shiksa pussy , you 're telling inc something I do n't know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls devour you . Have n't I seen my friends go under ? The wives ca n't walk upstairs . They need maids . They need vacations  --  in August once , in December once again . They 're sorry they laid anybody before they married you . They stop sanctioning looseness , bang , all of a sudden . One Friday you come in the door and they got the candles going , and then you 're really home . I 'm not saying I blame you , Paul . I 'm only trying to get to the bottom . " " Getting to the bottom does n't mean digging into sewers . How can you talk like this ? You do n't even know the girl . You never even saw her . " " I never even saw that baby I carry a picture of either . But I know what a baby is , so I can appreciate this one . This girl 's got a background on her you do n't even begin to understand . She 's got a family that probably this minute is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine over her . Just as smart and sensible . " " You think happiness comes out of gall ? You think that 'll be nice , earning all those enemies ? You think it 's enough to squirm around in bed with her , to wake up with her hand on your vitals ? What do you think that solves , Paulie , after the wad is popped ? " " Christ , Asher  --  you 're a dunghole , a toilet ? ! " " We 're talking man to man , right ? Do n't start crying . I 'm not a charming man . " " All right , Asher  --  man to man . If you 're a man , a human being , then why do n't you talk about love ? I love Libby . I 'm giving it to you straight now , though not so flowery as you . I love Libby . She 's alive , she 's sweet , she has deep and generous instincts . She has feelings . She , unlike you , is charming . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I 'm a cynic , but you 're worse . Marriage kills love . Do me a favor , look around at all the loving , ( - banning , happy couples . You count them for me . I 'll close my eyes , you tell me how many you come up with . " He took off his glasses , blew into them , then wiped away the steam on a piece of cloth he extracted from his coat pocket . His lower lids were jeweled with tears from the cold . Hooking the rims back over his elaborate ears , he said , " How many ? Once you get past the Duke and Duchess of Windsor it 's slim pickings , no ? Paulie , kiss the girl , stick it in her , but for Christ 's sake do me a favor and wait a year . You 're an artistic type , a serious observer of life , why kill your talent ? You 'll sap yourself with worry , you 'll die of a hard-on in the streets . Other women will tantalize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrestle till you choke . If a year elapses and the urge remains , then go ahead , hang yourself , there 's nothing anybody can do . Is a year too much to ask ? " " I 'm graduating , Asher , " Paul said , speaking with the patience of a wronged man . " She has a year to go , this girl you have so little regard for . When I leave Ithaca she 'll stay . Because I am so hard-up , you see , so controlled by my hot pants and this guilt I feel at having deflowered her , I feel I want to marry her . It 's as simple as that . " " Precisely . " " Asher ! Asher ! When I leave , you shmuck , I lose her . That 'll be that . " " I would n't myself , if I were you , stand in the way of an ending . " " But the plain and simple fact is , Asher , I do n't wont it to end ! Does that mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be angry . He swallowed , almost as though he 'd been weeping and wailing for an hour . " Listen to Uncle Shmuck , will you ? Things come and go , and you have got to be a receptacle , let them pass right through . Otherwise death will be a misery for you , boy , I 'd hate to see it . What are you going to grow up to be , a canner of experience ? You going to stick plugs in at either end of your life ? Let it tithe , let it go . Do n't clutch ! What is marriage but a form of greed , a terrible , disgusting ambitiousness . Do you know what 1 do now , Paulie , for a living ? I paint gangsters , petty thieves , the lousiest of rats , way way up there in the unions and the garment trade . They come in with their henchmen and they spit tangerine pits on my floor and they make fun of me while I paint the boss . They 're rich and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sloppy-ass bohemian . They 're the big shots and I 'm the nothing . All right , I take it . I accept . The boss 's got warts , I lop them off . He 's got murder in his eyes , I put doves instead . He sends his wife and I fill up her brassiere for her , I take out scowls , boils , wrinkles , bags , pores ? everything goes . I give out only peaches and cream . Please , I do n't want to be the greatest painter in the world . I do n't want to be a maker of beauty , a religious personage . I do n't bottle experience . I 'm interested in the flow . I 'll take the shape the world gives me . Screw the rest . Let me buy you a drink . It 's a hell of a day for a walk . You could freeze . " I N THE bar , the uncle and the nephew sipped whiskey and said nothing . Asher looked at his watch , then began to whistle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had bad breath  --  would n't a twenty-five year old girl mind ? Had there really been a Chinese who had drawn with her lips at that skin , wrinkly like a dying old flower ? Asher was a total surprise , not at all the kind of monk Paul had imagined . All his renunciations  --  family , children , food , clothes ? had n't been for his art at all . He had no art left . He was a tube with no plugs at either end . A receptacle . And that was what  --  courage or cowardice ? Paul was serious beyond his twenty-one years , and once an idea had been planted he could not easily discard it . He could not help asking himself if it made any sense at all to let Libby go . He was too purposive a young man  --  applying always in January for scholarships in September had given him a strong sense of consequence  --  to be casual about his decisions . However . his plan to marry was , he knew , no simple revolt against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bussing tables in mountain resorts , he had been well enough tipped by vacationing housewives and lonely widows ; from beneath they had stroked his hair : " Oh how nice and serious . You 'll he something in life . I 'm not worried about your future , " As for the family , there was no sense talking about revolutions at this point ; he had revolted at birth and lived a separate life under his own flag from infancy on . His kind of independence had not even allowed for the usual complaints ; nobody had had to stand and shout at him to get into his bedroom and study . He had always gotten A 's and never once in his life had he been in trouble . If his father was prickled by his own failures , it was not that his son had insulted him by bringing them up . Something had tipped off the boy early not to expect anything of the man . When he had not known the spelling of a word , he had taken down the dictionary  --  this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud , though secretly it gave her the shivers . She was a normal-school graduate , a major in arithmetic , and she could have helped him with his tong division . But he did everything himself , even fractions . When he was between the years one and five his father had failed in haberdashery ; four to six it was hardware ; six to eleven real estate ; and then eleven to twelve  --  the blinding , total crash  --  he lost his shirt in quick frozen foods . One day , with creditors calling at every door , he got into ? the cab of a truckfu of his frozen rhubarb and took a ride out to Long Island to 1hink ; the refrigeration failed just beyond Mineola , and by the time he got home his life was a zero , a ruined man . Now , in his reclining years , he got up once in a while to collect rents for an old friend . And during all this , through all the bank notes and bewilderment . Paul had learned to read and write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had even willed Libby DeWitt herself into a seriousness she had not possessed when he had first met her . So complete a job had he done , in fact , that it had been she who had first suggested marriage . Though it was none of Asher 's business , it was nevertheless so . How could she go back to the other boys after Paul ? His own decision was not , however , out of anything so simple , so unemotional , as obligation . If there was a sense of obligation it was to him . self : he would unite with her not to make Libby a better woman , but to make himself a better man . He would solidify his finest intentions by keeping beside him this mixture of frailty , gravity , spontaneity , and passion . He would serve another with the same sense of worthiness he served himself . Surely that was love , where duty and passion ( and lust too , to swallow Asher 's argument ) mingled . " Paulie , I have to leave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toilet . " In a few minutes he came out of the men 's room wiping his hands on his coat . " Look , how about you come back with me ? I want Patricia Ann and you to meet . She 'll make some tea . I wo n't say anything more myself . You 're too smart for me to flood you with my personal philosophy . just come back for an hour or two . I 'm past fifty , nearing the end . Every emotion you 've felt , multiply it by a thousand and that 's how often I felt it . It gives me a little edge , do n't it , Paulie ? Till forty you think you 've got bad emotions , you know , real killers  --  and then you find out they 're only little lowers compared with what 's coming .... " T E R Asher 's mother had died her son hail taken all of her potted plants to live with him in Manhattan . For the two years she was ill he had gone over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady claimed that the day nurse was an anti-Semite and would either drown her philodendrons , or leave them to dry up and crack . Some of the plants were higher than Asher himself , and the pots , spread around three of his walls , weighed up to seventy-five pounds . Before a row of tall windows at the front of the studio stood Asher 's easel , and outside and down was the El . They had walked up to the building past a row of bars , all of them full of bums . When Paul and his uncle entered the room , Patricia Ann was wiping the leaves of the plants with an old piece of her lover 's undershorts ; she immediately stuffed her dust rag under a pillow on the sofa . " It 's all right , " Asher told her . " Patricia Ann Keller  --  my nephew , Paul Herz . " She shook Paul 's hand . " I never think of Asher having relatives . What do you call him ? Uncle Asher ? " The laugh this produced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? as though a wind had blown through them . She was not really very much taller or heavier than Libby . Her gold ballet slippers had an inward , tomboyish turn , and her skirt and sweater left no doubt as to how high and how round were her various parts . Where run-of-the-mill people have the small of their back , she carried a little cannonball of a behind . Her breasts too , packed up nearly on a line with her shoulders , had the suggestion of small metallic spheres . Her face was a not very arresting , meager thing , pretty on the style of high-school baton twirlers : the mouth a bow , the chin a point , the eyes blue beads , the nose hardly big enough to support its freckles . Her hair fell onto her shoulders in ringlets ; naturally curly . Asher ran a finger over a philodendron leaf and then dropped into a ratty leather club chair , where he proceeded to kick off his shoes . He dropped his glasses into his left shoe and rolled his thumb and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open and Paul could see his tongue . " Make a little tea , dearie , " he said , very weary . Patricia Ann brought Paul his cup . " You go to college ? " " Yes , " he said . " 1 have a stepbrother  --  Virgil , " she called over to Asher . Then to Paul , " Virgil Cooper  --  he used to play basketball for City . " " Yes ? " " Yeah but that 's about ten years ago already . Even more . " She carried a cup to Asher . He directed her to put it at his feet and leave him be . ' ' You have a headache , Puss ? " she asked him . " Uh-uh . " " The plants really got all dusty , " she told him . " Okay . " " It 's from the windows being open , " she said to Paul . " I got ta breathe , " Asher said , more sleepy than rude , and the girl left his side . A long silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She pointed to her slippers . " It 's for comfort around the house . " She sat down on a stool beside Asher 's easel and lifted a pair of pumps from the floor . " Would you care for me to put these on ? " " No , " Paul said . " That 's fine . " " Well , " she said , sighing . Asher mumbled , Then he mumbled again , in his sleep . The day grew darker and darker , and across the room the man 's outline became less distinct . " It 's cold out , " Patricia Ann said . " You can feel it right through the window . Is it still cold out ? " " Very , " Paul said . " What college ? " she asked . " Cornell . " " Oh . In California . " " No . New York , " Paul said . " Really ? " " New York State . " " Oh . " She broke out laughing again , high , anxious , joyless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself and ashamed for his uncle and overcome with pathos for the girl . She crossed and uncrossed her legs , she examined and re-examined her nails , and finally she shrugged , as though resigning herself to some tragedy having to do with her cuticles . The El train made five trips down below the window , and in that time nobody spoke . Paul 's curiosity finally went dead under his disbelief . What  --  what had Asher wanted him to see ? Was he being stupid and dense ? Was he missing something ? Was this happiness , saintliness  --  was this the serenity of which men dream ? Look , was this or was this not human waste ? It was . And , curiously , the sight of his uncle 's condition brought palpitations to Paul 's heart . The messiness surrounding him , the indignity of it all , suddenly shook his own faith in himself . He experienced dread at the thought of his own life going wrong . He actually allowed himself to wonder if there might not be a less stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Could he not chase butterflies again in Prospect Park , catch them fluttering in his cheesecloth and coat hanger ? Could n't he wait outside the showers at Ebbets Field for a glimpse of Pee Wee Reese ? Could n't he rise and fall , just for a while again , over those suntanned ladies in South Falls-burg , New York ? Diligent Paul , hopeful Paul , penniless Paul  --  could n't he sit alone in his room composing one thousand heartfelt words for the scholarship committee , promising he would be a good boy , that he would study if awarded the eight hundred dollars ? Nol Absolutely notl He was fed up with being a boy . That 's why Asher looked so pathetic  --  fifty and bald and still wearing his Eton suit . He could not confront the world a full-sized man . He could never take a wife , accept the burden . And now look : a receptacle all right , a garbage can , full of dirty talk and volcanic regrets . Paul could not believe in Asher not having regrets ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on . Patricia Ann looked at her watch and then at her Asher , and gave out a soft moan . She tried to turn a smile on the nephew but only revealed impatience and loss . Her Wednesday afternoon was going , going " Do you have the time ? " she asked . His kindness went out to her . " I think I 'll leave , " Paul said . Almost instantly she was at the door . " It was nice meeting you , " Paul said . " Do n't wake him . " " I never met a person from Asher 's family before , " she whispered , and then gave the crumpled up sleeping figure across the room a loving glance . " It 's very nice , " she said , and took Paul 's hand to shake it . " Asher 's a terrific painter . He 's the most wonderful person I ever met . He 's not like anybody . " " I know , " Paul said . " I 'm very fond of Asher . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck at Cordell . " " Thank you . " Pushing the door shut , she said , " Have a nice time at college .

Behind the door Paul heard , " Asher , Asher , oh wake up pussy cat , it 's after five already . " U NCLE JERRY sent a note . If Paul felt inclined to , he could call Jerry at his office . If he chose to ignore the note , that was his prerogative as well . " How are you holding up ? " Jerry inquired when Paul telephoned . " I think I 'm all right . I 've lost two pounds but -I 've got all my Faculties . " " How are things at home ? " " Just as you can imagine , " Paul said . " My mother keeps breaking down and my father keeps wanting to talk to me , but he gets all filled up too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've stopped . I 'm not going to make a dent . They just say , please do n't marry that girl . At least not now . At least put it off . And so Forth , on and on and on . Honest to God , they 're going to make me hate them ! " He had not realized how menacing he had sounded until he heard Jerry protecting himself . " Paul , I feel obliged , you know  --  your father called me , he was in tears . I told him I would contact you . That 's why I dropped you the note . I do n't know what to say to you . I do n't want to advise you . I do n't believe in interfering . " Paul felt a strong kinship with his uncle then ? but it did not make him especially happy . It had not been his plan or his hope to line up , finally , against his family . He had decided to tell them in December of Libby , so that their protests might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for a wedding just after graduation . He had a sense of propriety about them , a realization of their responsibilities that perhaps they themselves had n't . He had never given in , he thought , to any impulse to be cruel to them , and even if he had worked hard independently of them , it had been in part so as not to increase in any way their disappointments . He felt it now a filial duty to give them every chance ; it would have humbled him not to , in the great world beyond the family to which he aspired , a world of order and decency , which if he had not as yet experienced , he had fully imagined . Nevertheless , it began to appear that perhaps he had called Jerry for reasons no more elevated than those which had sent him on his walk with Asher : to be reassured . " I told your father I would contact you , " Jerry said . " But of course 1 ca n't say anything . I do n't even know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't complicate matters explaining any of this to Leonard . It would n't have interested him . I understand , " he said to Paul , softly , intimately . " Paul , you tell me , all right . What do you think ? " The young man 's voice was sharp when he answered . " What do I think ? I think I 'll marry - Libbyl I do n't think any of this hysteria has anything to do with us . They hardly know her . in fact , they do n't know her . " Then his own chagrin swallowed him up ; he had no reason-whatsoever to be short-tempered with this particular uncle . " Your father says they met her ? " Jerry inquired , still delicate . " I brought her here Thanksgiving . I wanted to please them . " Those words , like the rest of his familial generosity , suddenly turned a little sour on him . If they would n't please him , why must he be trying so hard to please them ? " Your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm only repeating him , believe me . " " Jerry , she gets colds , " he answered wearily . " Jerry , let 's even say she 's a frail girl . But she 's not going to be a farmer . She 's going to be my wife . This is all very silly . Jerry  --  you know what they object to ? " " She 's Catholic . " " She 's Catholic . " He himself knew that to be , however , only a strand in the whole tapestry of rejection . It was not just one crime they wanted to hang the girl on  --  there was her youth , her health , her faith , their son 's youth , and a dozen things more . If they had known the word they would have claimed that their sense of Paul 's error was intuitive ; it was the word with which he had begun to argue with himself in favor of his decision . " Jerry , she 's a Catholic like I 'm a Jew . It 's nnt. the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our lives , It has n't to do with us . It 's another ruse . " " Paul , I 'm put in a position where I 'm asking questions I do n't even want to ask . How could I hope to reason with you , anyway , one way or the other ? We 're not dealing with the mind , with the practical senses . This is the mysterious , spontaneous choice  --  the choice of the heart . The unencumbered heart , " Jerry said . " Yes , " Paul answered , unhinged slightly by his uncle 's reverent tones . " The heart , Paul , knows . It cost me half a lifetime to learn such a simple fact . I had such neuroses pressing in upon me , they were the size of mountains . Tremendous pathetic pressures building and building , and cutting me off from what you think of as your inside self . Paul , I did n't do a spontaneous thing in twenty-seven years . Because the heart , my organ of spontaneity , was under this terrific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be . I 'm telling you , it wo n't give you peace if it 's defied . Love ! " Jerry cried . And Paul cried back , " Jerry , I love her . " And his uncle replied sweetly , " That 's all then . That 's all that counts . " Then , for having provoked such wholesale ap ' proval , Paul felt wave upon wave of indecency lap up against him . True as they may have been , his words had been spoken out of nothing less than design . And why had he to convince Jerry ? So Jerry could turn around and convince him ? It was an unavoidable fact , that ever since his afternoon on Third Avenue , certainty had somehow been seeping away . He could not believe that Asher and his bird-brained mistress had informed him of anything other than what everybody knew about squandered lives  --  yet he had begun to think of himself as being not so courageous as fearful , Fear began to seem the springboard of much that he had done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right  --  a planner , a young man who invests emotion one day to accumulate love and admiration the next . He had come to see his marrying Libby in two distinct ways  --  both of which , unfortunately , cast doubt on his manliness and dignity . On the one hand , it all seemed so safe . Husband , wage-earner , father  --  right on down the line , all the duties and offices laid out for him . From home to college to a wife  --  no chances taken . Without much effort , Ile could recall from his past not a few risks he had worked a little hard at avoiding . Even recently with his parents : he knocked against the walls of their house in December , hoping that somehow by May they would find a way to prevent the roof from falling in . He wanted to remain the good son . He seemed even to himself to be working too strenuously at being upright . Otherwise he would tell them to go to hell . Run off , marry the girl and leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was what Asher would have done , he thought . And because he saw it as being a choice that Asher might have made , it too caused him discomfort . If marrying Libby was taking no risks , it was also taking every risk . Asher 's life had unnerved him terribly  --  with a little twisting and turning he could think of it as his own . Way down , he had begun to bend an ear toward his parents ' objections . He was no longer so sure that he was seeing Libby as clearly as his uncle , the painter , saw Patricia Ann . He did not know that he wanted to see that clearly . He only knew that he did not want merely to stick it right up in Libby ; he wanted to love her . Feeling something less than a daredevil , he IIstened to Uncle Jerry comforting him . " Paul , good luck then . I think that 's the only proper thing for any of us to say . " " Thank you . " " Tell Libby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Paul knew they would like each other right off . " When will you be married ? " " Not till May . Around graduation . " " Will I get to see you before you go back ? I 'd like to take you to dinner tomorrow night . I 'll invite Claire and her husband . She 'd love to see you . " " That 's very kind , Jerry . I 'll call Libby . " I KNOW I 've got character in my face  --  but wo n't someone say I 'm pretty ? " Well , on the steps of the Placa , with all that swank hurrying by , she had her wish . Character had been bled from her for the evening , and in its place was prettiness . She had made up the top and bottom rims of her eyes , and managed even to reduce the proud leap of her nose ; it lost its sailing proportions beneath the great mast of her black hair , which was piled atop her head , revealing a slender boyish back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been visited with a definite burst of pleasure . Gradually , however , he became irritated , thinking to himself : she has decked herself out . Why ? Actually she was wearing only a simple black suit with a tight jacket and a full skirt , but its fetchingness ? acknowledged by its owner in her very gait  --  was in the way it made so apparent the delicacy of her shoulders and neck . Despite her dripping nose and the weather , she had worn no blouse , so that one was of course touched by the wistful dent of her ribs in the wide yoke of the jacket . The wad of Kleenex in her white glove ( there to inform his parents of sanitoriutns and hospital bills ) only made more glamorous her tiny garnet earrings and bracelet . They proceeded through the lobby to the entrance of the Oak Room , and when Paul looked at her again , he looked deeply , intently , after some sign of the Libby he had planned to marry up at school : the straight shoulder-length black hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winterized , libraryized , studentized Libby . What he found instead was something that bothered him , and that he could only think of as aspiration . Yet as they spotted Uncle Jerry , and moved into the dining-room , Paul put his mouth to her hair . He explained her little display of prosperity and polish to himself as an attempt on her part to impress some Herz . That his mother and father dreaded her so for their son , led her , he knew , to begin to wonder what kind of ogre she might actually be . Paul knew this , and he knew how much protection his intended needed . He said into her ear , " My wife , " feeling a ripple of well-being as the word passed from his lips . " Husband , " Libby whispered  --  and that thrilled him too . Libby-had come such a long way from being a sorority sister to being a woman . He , Paul , had lifted her up from childhood with him . Now  --  the thought had a peculiar forcefulness as Libby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ! Uncle Jerry 's daughter Claire was Paul 's age . It had always been expected in the family that because they had been born within a month of one another they should like one another . But even during the flirtation they had carried on in the closing months of their seventeenth year , there had been little affection between them . Paul went on  --  following an evening when they had taken off their clothes and stood glaring , breathlessly , at one another  --  Paul had gone on to college and high literature , and Claire to a promiscuity at Syracuse , stories of which had reached Paul 's ears every Monday morning , sixty miles away at Cornell . But with dinner at the Plaza ( snow fell on the carriages out the window , beyond Libby 's hair ) all was changed . Claire was taking a special delight in showing Paul how matronly she had become , and how human . She listened with her whole being to the remarks of her husband , an average crew-cut sort of IBM machine , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration , and hot Claire Herz . The firm he was with was splitting stock or changing hands , or something that Paul was not following ; whatever , Claire responded as though he was singing exquisite tenor . Once Paul thought he saw her eyes shut when her husband spoke about a large loan a Mr. Richmond was floating . She might have been visualizing it aloft . Finally she discovered Libby and her clothes ; and Libby , it seemed , discovered herself . " I never usually go to Carita , " Libby said , measuring Claire 's response , " because you have to wait so long . " " They do do a wonderful job , " Claire said . " It 's so lovely . " " It 's only the second time I 've been there . " Claire lifted a finger as though to touch Libby 's crown , and Paul realized that they were not talking about Libby 's clothes . Carita was where she had had her hair set . He had imagined that she had fixed it herself in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him into a grave contemplation of the future . All his contemplations of the last few days had been grave in tone , and large in scope . He was no longer thinking ahead strictly in terms of semesters and summers . The young women in the meantime had proceeded into a discussion of Delman 's shoes . Finally Libby excused herself and went off to the powder-room  --  doubtless , thought Paul , to work up her eyes a little more . Claire put her hand on her cousin 's . " She 's wonderful , Paul . I think she 's the most wonderful thing that could have happened to you . She 's so charming , and so alive , and so pretty . Her eyes  --  her hair ? " " We wish you all the luck . " Claire 's husband said , and he snapped his head at Paul , meaning it . " I think we have to go home , hon , " he said to his stout , good-looking young wife . " Baby-sitters , " Claire said . She spoke wearily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her own maternal obligations . She rose , a matron at twenty-one . W H E N Claire and her husband had left , Jerry said , " Harold is a fine boy . A very solid boy . " " lie seems very nice . " Paul tried to concentrate on his uncle , as opposed to himself ; he was di . vided in his feelings about Libby 's return to the table . When she had gotten up to leave he had actually felt relief : he had become terribly uncertain about what she might say next . He seemed to have become uncertain about her , on the basis of her not setting her hair at home ! He waited for her to return , with the same ambivalence with which he waited for his uncle to begin to swap confidences with him . " He 's especially fine for Claire , " Jerry said . " He holds her in check . You may not have known it , but she had an exuberant streak in her in college . " " Yes ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could have made a mess of herself . When I left Selma , " Jerry said , " she , of course , lost a father image , there 's no doubt about that . But had I stayed any longer , she would have lost it anyway . Worse things might have happened . " Paul wondered , until Jerry told him . " None of us . " Jerry said , " are without incestuous feelings . And it is n't the feelings , you see  --  it 's how you act them out . " Jerry seemed to feel that he had explained something ; Paul only felt the desperate sordid decency of admitting to such motives . " This young man , " Jerry was saying , " he 's no whiz , no spectacular ball of fire . But he 's steady and he 's a mensch , and he 's done wonders for Claire . You 70 PAUL LOVES LIBBY ought to see her with that baby . She relates so beautifully it could make you cry . " " I 'll bet she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . " " Yes , " Paul said , " I 'm glad we all had a chance to be together . " " I 'm glad we all had a chance to meet Libby . I think you 've got a fine girl . " " Thank you . " " Thank yourself . It 's not often young people know what they want . It 's not often you find a young person who 's discovered the essentials . They run around and play around  --  like'Claire , they try each other out . It 's not a healthy thing , what 's happening with this generation . They ' get laid , ' they ' screw , ' " he said , " anti those expressions express just what they do . There 's a lot of grabbing and pawing , but very little touching . However , I see your Libby and I see Claire now , and they look like two girls who know what it means to touch . " Uncle Jerry 's eyes were wet suddenly . In the cultivated atmosphere of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and white flakes falling on the Park and the candlelight shimmering on the long curtains , Jerry was not able to prevent the tears from sliding down his face . After he dried them , Paul expected he might see two pale spots where his uncle 's coloring had been rubbed off by the napkin . Uncle Jerry , forever struggling up for air in the dark sea of maladjustment and poor mental health , had shed two tears for Love . That was the name , barely visible , painted on the ship that would come along and pull him safely to shore . had rescued his daughter , and now he was telling Paul it had rescued him , and one sunny day it would come along and rescue Jerry too . He would find a woman who was not a mother figure , like his oversized Selma , and not a daughter figure , like the short-lived twenty-seven-yearold ; all he was looking for was a woman who could touch him . Paul realized that all evening he had been looking at his uncle through Asher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes . Libby , just then , came back to the table , and so she was seen through Asher 's eyes too . When Paul tried to look at her through Jerry 's eyes , it occurred to him that that may have been how he had been looking all along . It was no longer clear in his mind whether he could consider himself a realist or a romantic . " Are you all right ? " Paul whispered , as he pulled her chair out for her . " I just put some drops in to get some air ? " she said , but he smelled a perfume on her that he had never noticed before . " I was talking to Claire and Jack in the lobby , " she said to Jerry . " All this time ? " asked Paul . " Yes . They 're awfully nice , " she said to Jerry . " They 're all a father could hope for , " Jerry said , and from there Jerry and Libby proceeded , for the rest of the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hour that followed  --  say art , and he heard her say beauty , and he heard her say truth . Twice she said objective correlative . Of course it did not matter that she echoed him ; of course she was still learning . She had come a long way already from the Pi Phi house , on whose steps he had found her a little less than a year ago . In courting her he had changed her , he had worked at changing her ; and now he wondered if she would ever be the genuine article . Was she bright ? Was she true ? Would she continue to grow ? Trying to improve her , had he only made a monkey of her ? What a time to be asking himself such questions ! He tried to admire her for winning so completely the affection of his uncle , but he was nut able to . 0 N THE subway back to Queens he asked her how much it cost to have a hair set at the Carita Salon . " Fifteen dollars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " They wash it and they set it . They have to tease my hair  --  it 's so straight . " " Is the teasing figured into the bill , or is that free ? " " Did I behave badly ? " Libby demanded , " Did I talk too much ? 1 realized 1 was talking a lot . Oh Paul , what 's the matter ? " " Nothing . " " You 're not happy spend on hair ? " . . . Yes . " et " Do you really , or is that to please me ? " " Both . " " And do n't charm me , will you ? I 'm not Jerry . " " What 's the matter , Paul ? I did talk too much . " " No . " " Then what ? Because I went to Carita or because I talked about it with Claire ? Please tell me . " She was a self-improver , and that strain in her character ( which once he had loved and now suddenly it seemed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul , tell me , " she said . " I did n't know you had such extravagant tastes . My haircuts cost me a buck . " " It was a special occasion . " Then she began to cry . " I 'm sorry I did it . I am . . " " I ca n't afford stuff like that , Libby . We 're going to have to live a frugal life . A sensible life . I 'm beginning to wonder if we 're in agreement . begin to wonder if you understand ? " " Oh honey , " she said , and put her head into his shoulder . " I 'm stupid . " And she reached up for her mound of hair and pulled it down . His heart lurched , but he kept his mouth shut ; some pins clattered to the floor of the subway car , and she became the old Libby , her hair to her shoulders . " I 'm sorry , Paul . Oh truly  --  I was putting on a performance to please everybody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I fee/ running and pursued and like I 'm bouncing all over the place . Oh Paul , I 'm just exhausted , and this cold wo n't go away , and all 1 tasted all night were nose drops . Everybody said the wine was excellent and so T said so too . " She had buried her head in his chest and he was stroking her hair . lie did it to comfort her ; he got no pleasure from the spongy resilient quality of that black hair , whose crowy smoothness had always expressed something to him about the simple desires , the solid yearnings of the girl he had discovered . After a while she took his hand and held it in her lap . " Paul ? " " Yes . " " ? I do n't think I can wait until May , or June . If I 'm going to marry you I think it better be now . We 'll move into your room and we 'll be married and all this will be over . I ca n't stand it any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . " She kissed his five Fingers to prove it . " I knew you were upset about it . 1 knew it was that . " There was a Puerto Rican at the end of the car reading a newspaper . He had looked up to watch the girl cry , but now that she had pulled herself together he looked hack into the paper again . Your uncle , " she was saying , " is so nice and everybody else is so awful , and he 's so unhappy . " " And so are you . " " And so am I , and so are you , and we 're perfectly nice people too . He has n't got anybody ? " " He 's got Claire ? " " Oh she 's a phony ! " Libby cried , softly . " And so am I , " she said . " I saw it in your eyes . Oh you phony , you were saying , why do n't you cut it out . And I could n't , Paul . I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she an-nounced . " I hate him ! He 's a disgusting man ! " " All right , Lib , calm down . Nobody 's paying any attention to him at all . " She might have been hesitating , or she might have been calculating , but finally she whispered into his scarf , " You are . " " I am what ? " he demanded . " I ca n't talk without you getting some sour little look on your face . You 're not you . " " You 're imagining it . " He sat up very straight , so that it became necessary for her to pull her face away . " You 're just upset . " She was willing to be convinced . " Am I ? " " I think so . " " Because he does n't even know me ! Paul , Paul ? what 's wrong with me ! What does everybody have against me ! " " I should n't have told you about him . Everything is all right . " " Paul , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's go back married . Please . " His immediate vision was of the two of them trying to live in his tiny room : Libby 's father would cut off next semester 's tuition ; his own family would refuse to be present at graduation . . . But more pleasant visions followed . For it would only continue to be as it had been before : they would study together in the library , and sleep together in his room . Only now Libby would move the rest of her clothes in , and sleep clear through till morning . They would not have to meet for breakfast ; they would already be there , together . As for the families , they had obligations that they would finally admit to . And next year he would get some sort of graduate fellowship for himself ; he had already sent off applications to Columbia , Penn , Michigan , and Chicago , well in advance of the closing date . Libby 's father would probably continue to pay her tuition through her senior year Or would he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . To whom would the registrar address Mrs. Herz 's bills ? But even if it was to himself , they had already figured out on a blank page at the back of Libby 's American literature notebook , that what with summer jobs , fellowships , and part-time work , there would be enough to pay bills , and maybe even some left over to buy an old car . They had figured this out in the library , one idyllic night before the vacation , with the gorges and the trees heavy with snow . Now on the empty subway , the overhead bulbs went black a moment , and he wondered if he could have added wrong . He had figured up food , rent , tuition , laundry , amusements . . . Paul came upon no item they had overlooked ; there was actually no reason he could think of not to marry tomorrow instead of in May . But it was with a distinct sensation of being torn apart , that he agreed . " Oh Paul . . " She wept now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license tomorrow and the blood business , and then we 'll get married at City Hall . Only a few days . " He kissed her hand . " Cheer up , " he instructed them both . But she did n't cheer up . By the time they left the subway there was a scattering of Kleenex around her shoes ; she gave an especially heartrending sob as they emerged into the raw , slushy night . He steered her across the street into a coffee shop , and not until she had drunk half her coffee did he attempt a conversation ; he waited until her chest and throat noises had subsided , and only an occasional tear made an appearance beneath her murky eyes . " What is it ? " he asked . " What now ? " " Paul ... I do n't think  --  this may sound silly . . . I do n't think I could survive City Hall . " She even amused herself by the sheer torpor of the remark . Her smile , however , lifted him little , curling as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes , " he said , closing his eyes . " But I 'm no orphan ! I 'm no culprit ! " she said vehemently . " People get married at City Hall when they want to hide something . When they 're running somewhere . When girls are pregnant they get married at City Hall . I 'm not pregnant ? I was spared that particular tragedy  --  why must I act like I was n't ! I 'm not pregnant , damn it ! " She dragged some grains of mascara across her nose with her Kleenex . Moral outrage was now sweeping hysteria away ; she expelled a powerful breath , having thought probably of five more things she was n't and would n't be compromised into being . " l 'm not letting people  --  parentsforce me to  --  to act as though I 'm ashamed . To take away my dignity , " she said , his student  --  his own words . " I 'm not , Paul . You know we should n't allow them ? " He heard the conviction rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was holding his forehead in his hands . " Paul ? Paul  --  what do you think ? " " I do n't know . " He did not show her his eyes . " What do you think ? " " I do n't know . . " " That 's too bad , " he said . " I 've run out of suggestions . " " How about , " Libby said , after a moment ? " what do you think  --  of a rabbi ? " " Why ? " " Oh Paul , would n't he be more official  --  more everything we want ? Would n't it show them something if we decided to be married by a rabbi ? I 'm not being defiant , I simply wo n't cower in some corner when I get married ! What kind of thing is that ? You get married once . I think it should have some weight to it . " When he looked up it was because he had regained his control . " It should have weight . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libby . " Helplessly she pointed out that he was . He said nothing . She blew her nose . " But  --  but we are basically religious people . Our values  --  oh stop giving me that sour look ! " " Well , stop talking like that . I 'm not Jerry . " " Why do you think I 'm so stupid ! " " Libby , I do n't . Do n't cry , please . Lib , I 'm sorry . It 's just ? " he tried it slowly ? " we 're not , honey , basically Jewish people . " " Paul , they 're not going to make me into a nothing . I refuse to let them force me to be married in City Hall ! I 'll go to a priest then . Anything ! " " I could n't go to a priest . I could n't be married by a priest , that 's all there is to it . " " Because you are Jewish finally ! Oh sweetie just be a little Jewish , will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to sound so silly . I only want this one thing ? " And then never my own way again . He heard these last words like an echo . At nineteen she had already given him whatever she had ; now she would promise him the rest forever . All she wanted satisfied was her sense of decency , which was what in her he had cared for and nurtured . She had a knowledge , this frail girl , of what her rights were in love , and for that too he was thankful and proud . They need not crawl along the ground because others wanted them to . B u T they were married outside New York by a Justice of the Peace in the Yellow Pages . No rabbi would handle their case , which came to the couple as a surprise . Their astonishment did not , however , keep them above having dirty feelings about themselves for very long . In the study of the third rabbi they visited , Paul rose up out of his seat and cursed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriages on kitchen tables ? In all of this city is there no man low enough to unite two people who want to be united ? " " Try City Hall , " the rabbi said , a heavy dark-jowled man who had n't liked Paul from the start . " Get united civilly . " " We can try City Halt without your advice ! " " Paul , " Libby pleaded , stretching out a hand to him . But he did n't even want to see her face . Was he to compromise himself forever , honoring this girl 's weaknesses ? Attending to her wishes , did he not dissolve into a spineless ass ! A hypocrite ! A softie ! " I marry Jew and Jew , " scowled Lichtman , the rabbi . " That 's all . " " We 're Jew and Gentile . " " The ceremony does n't fit such occasions . " " God damn you ! " Paul shouted . " Do n't raise your voice in this office ! This is n't the street ! Next , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be as wise as you are loud , then come around here ! If you believe , believe  --  if no , turn your hack ! Otherwise look other places ! Go be religious your own way ! Do n't run here to make it all right with Mama ! I 'm no moral-out for you . I 'm not here to be amiable  --  that 's a disgusting thought ! " " I 'm not asking for my mama , Lichtman , I 'm asking for my wife . " " Some improvement ! You should he ashamed ! Are you Catholic ? " he demanded of Libby , a kind of agony suddenly in his face . " Yes . " " So why not ask a priest ? Why not ask him to unite you and this Jew ? They have City Hall for mixtures like this . " " You do n't have to be so nasty to her ? " " Shut up ! You 're a secular , be secular ! Do n't come tramping your muddy feet in my synagogue for sentimental reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews ! Now get out ! You 're stupid and you curse and you 're a coward ! Get out ! " The Justice of the Peace displayed no such force , as he had , for one thing , the gout . It was necessary for him to remain seated while he married them , though he compensated for his posture with a clear , loud , nondenominational voice . It was a Sunday afternoon and when Paul and Libby had entered , they found the JP pulled up close to an old cabinet radio , a large scroll ) . piece with WEAF WJZ WOR WABC marked on the yellowed station selector . The JP 's wife turned off the radio during the ceremony . She was an elderly lady who wore glasses and a print dress that was a little longer in back than in front ; below were nurse 's white oxfords . She touched the bride at least ten times , and removed some artificial flowers from the closet and put them ina blue vase behind her husband " the Judge " ? whose bandage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all over the Judge 's wife put the flowers back in the closet and tuned in the radio . The couple from next door , who had been called in to serve as witnesses , hugged the newlyweds ; the woman hugged Paul , the man Libby . The Judge 's wife looked from Libby 's ring to Paul 's ring and said all there actually was to say about them ; she managed more excitement than one really even had the right to expect from the wife of an old sick JP . " They match , " she said . The Judge said , " Elizabeth , Paul , will you step up here , please ? " They approached , after a quick glance at each other , expecting his blessing . He said , " Now you know how to get back into the city , do n't you ? " " Yes , " they said . " That 'll be ten , " said the Judge . He preferred not to take a check on Paul 's Ithaca bank . " We 're dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife reminded the young couple . Libby had to give them the cash . Two buses and a subway carried them back to New York in an hour and a half ; Libby got out before Paul so as to change trains for Queens  --  husband and wife would meet at six that night at Grand Central with their suitcases . When they parted , so preoccupied were they , that they forgot to embrace . Paul went the rest of the way alone , back to Brooklyn to tell his family what he had done . He got off the subway at Atlantic Avenue  --  where he was familiar with every trash can , every signpost , every pillar  --  and on the way up the street to his family 's apartment , he slipped his ring off his finger and into his coat pocket . He would begin his accounting slowly , give them a chance . . . But then he saw before him that grave , ironic , savage face of Lichtman 's , he remembered the insults and the pain , and he put the ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and entered with his news . And his father threw him out of the house . Mr. Herz had not summoned up so much courage since he had invested his life 's savings in frozen foods , and gorse under for the fourth time . But he would n't go under again ! In one life how many times can a man fail ? On the train back to Ithaca , Paul wept . " We do n't need them , " Libby said , cradling his hand in the dark car . " We do n't need anybody . " " That is n't it , " her husband replied . " That is n't it . . . " And it was and it wasn't.
