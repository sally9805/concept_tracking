The anniversary of Robert Kennedy 's assassination was marked by the reminiscence of columnists , the rebroadcast of old TV interviews , and the celebration of memorial Masses . But probably the most effective remembrance was the publication last week of Jack Newfield 's Robert Kennedy : A Memoir ( E. P. Dutton ; $6.95 ) . It brings-to three the number of full-length retrospectives by relatively young , able journalists who both knew and admired their subject . Each differs in tone and focus , and each has qualities the others lack . <P> The strength of David Halberstam 's The Unfinished Odyssey of Robert Kennedy ( Random House ; $4.95 ) lies in a felicity of language and a feeling for the political and social unease in the U.S. as the election of 1968 approached . ( Halberstam , now 35 and an editor of Harper 's magazine , won a Pulitzer prize for his 1963 New York Times coverage of Viet Nam . ) He begins his account in the late summer of 1967 with a meeting between Bobby and Allard Lowenstem , a leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his doomed campaign , ending with the terrible moment in Los Angeles . <P> To Halberstam , Kennedy was a man caught between principle and practicality , between the new politics and the old , racked by indecision and buffeted by forces and events beyond prophecy or control . " He was playing Hamlet , " writes Halberstam , " thinking about the race constantly , wanting to make it , being led there by his emotions again and again , only to be brought back from the brink by the cold words of his closet advisors . " <P> The narrative moves swiftly . Maintaining an even , detached perspective , Halberstam generates a momentum that carries the reader headlong into the stonewall shock of the book 's last sentence . " Then he descended to acknowledge his victory , to talk about the violence and divisiveness , and to let a nation discover in his death what it had never understood or believed about him during his life . " <P> For all its literary flair , Halberstam 's Odyssey lacks the historical detail of 55 Days-The Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ; $6.95 ) . As chief political writer for the Newhouse newspapers , Witcover , 41 , saw more of the campaign than Halberstam , and what he failed to see he diligently traced through those who did . Written chronologically ( from January 1968 through the June funeral ) , 85 Days abounds in unreported behind-the-scenes incidents and anecdotes . The author notes , for example , that Kennedy seriously urged TV Newscaster Walter Cronkite to run for Senator in New York . He vividly re-creates a hotel-room scene in which Kennedy , wearing only his shorts , berates Adam Walinsky and Jeff Greenfield , two young speech-writing aides , for spending more time plucking at guitars than pecking at typewriters . At the time , Kennedy was facing defeat in Oregon . <P> Despite a weakness for the gratuitous aside ( " That was Gene McCarthy ; he did n't know when he was licked " ) , Witcover usually keeps his feelings for Kennedy in check : his high esteem for the man comes through all the stronger because he also criticizes some of his actions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees in
