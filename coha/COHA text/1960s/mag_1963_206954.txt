" Hup , hoop , hreep , hrope ! " bellow the R.O.T.C. drill sergeants , and to many U.S. college students the whole idea of uniforms , parades and dull " military science " classes appears more than ever to be preparation for a doughboy war in an age when more academic learning would serve the nation better . The Navy 's 53-campus " Holloway " volunteer plan , offering complete scholarships , produces a steady supply of bright young officers , but Air Force R.O.T.C. at 187 schools harvests only 4% of trainees as commissioned officers , and the Army 's 247-campus program is notoriously archaic . Among college administrators , who consider it much too costly , compulsory R.O.T.C. is now so widely resented that last year alone a dozen campuses dropped it. * <P> Facing up to this ferment , the Pentagon is about to ask Congress to approve sharp revisions in R.O.T.C. The Air Force wants to cut four-year A.F.R.O.T.C. to two , beginning in a student 's junior year , with weekly class time reduced from five hours to three . Sweetening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind up with far more career officers , yet spend a lot less money . Also saving money in the new budget , the Army has cut out high school R.O.T.C. , which enrolled 60,000 students and cost $5,000,000 . <P> The Army is less anxious for change at college level : R.O.T.C. annually supplies about 90% of its new second lieutenants ( 17,500 needed this year ) . The Army goes along with the Air Force two-year plan , but in its own way . It will probably cut weekly classes to four hours rather than three , and not offer scholarships unless recruits fail to appear . How Congress will react to all this is anyone 's guess . But no one doubts that a cheaper , more efficient R.O.T.C. must be devised . <P> * The 1862 Morrill Act , which established land-grant colleges , required them to teach military tactics . Whether or not R.O.T.C. is made compulsory is up to each school ; 20 have chosen to make it elective . In Illinois , Kansas , Maine and West Virginia , state laws require it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
