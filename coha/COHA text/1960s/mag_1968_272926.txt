While studying for a final exam in structural geology at Colorado School of Mines last year , Graduate Student George Rouse , 33 , was struck by a strange geological coincidence : deep earthquake zones angle into the earth at an average of 60 from the horizontal . His curiosity piqued , Geochemist Rouse decided to look for an explanation . What he found has become the basis of a new theory that-if proven valid-will have earth-shaking implications in the field of geophysics . <P> Working with a $1.50 globe of the world , Rouse picked a seismic zone off the coast of Chile and projected it into an imaginary flat surface or plane slicing through the earth . He discovered that along the circle formed where the plane intersected the surface of the earth there were other earthquake and major fault zones-in the Pyrenees Mountains , the Red Sea and the western tip of South America . During the next three weeks , Rouse projected the planes of other earthquake zones to form 15 additional circles , or belts , on the earth 's surface . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were most of the major seismic features of the globe : the ridges and faults associated with earthquake activity . Furthermore , most of the 19 points on the earth 's surface where three Rouse belts intersected coincided with areas of major earthquake or volcanic activity . Significantly , the planes of the belts passed through the boundary between the earth 's molten core and its solid mantle , each being approximately tangent to the core . <P> When Rouse presented his little globe and big theory to Colorado School of Mines Geochemistry Professor Ramon Bisque last September , Bisque was overwhelmed by the implications . " My God ! " he said . " Yes , " Rouse solemnly agreed . In the months since , Rouse and Bisque have discovered that primary mineral deposits , mountains , ocean-floor ridges and trenches and island chains also lie along the Rouse belts . They have even correlated variations in the earth 's magnetic and gravitational fields with their all-telling circles . <P> Modeling Dough . What causes the stress in the plane of a Rouse belt , resulting in quakes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colorado scientists suggest that both interplanetary and glactic magnetic fields interact with the earth 's magnetic field , thus tugging on the earth 's iron core . But the core is prevented from responding to extraterrestrial magnetic pull by the inertia of the rotating mantle that surrounds it . The resulting conflict sets up stresses in the boundary between the mantle and the core that are released in planes tangent to the core . <P> For a rudimentary demonstration of their theory , Rouse and Bisque used children 's Modeling Dough to mold a mantle around a solid core . The core was attached to a spindle that the scientists used to spin their model earth , accelerating it to simulate the effects of tugging magnetic fields . When the modeling compound dried and formed a thin crust , its larger cracks clearly defined major stress planes that were tangent to the core .
