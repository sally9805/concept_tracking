A professor of anthropology at the University of Illinois , Oscar Lewis has done field work in Canada , Cuba , India , Texas , Spain , and Mexico , He recently wrote this to " Harper 's " concerning " Manuel in the Thieves ' Market " : " What I am trying to do in this article ? and in my new book , " The Children of Sanchez , " from which it was adapted ? was expressed just recently by C. P. Snow , who wrote , ' Sometimes I am afraid that people in rich countries . hove so completely forgotten what it is like to be poor that we no longer feel or talk with the less lucky . This we must learn to do ' . " " The Children of Sanchez , " which continues the narrative of Manuel and other members of his family , will be published by Random House this summer . An analysis of Mexico 's social and economic problems by Professor Lewis appears in the hook , " Social Change in Latin America , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks in the following article is that of Manuel Sanchez , a thirtyyear-old tradesman who works in the Tepito , or Thieves ' Market , in Mexico City . In recent years I have come to know him and the rest of the Sanchez family well , and they have described their lives and feelings to me in tape-recorded interviews , from which this narrative is excerpted . The Thieves ' Market lies in the slums in the northeastern part of the city and it is the largest second-hand market in Mexico , perhaps in the hemisphere . In the last few years the market stalls , from which an incredible collection of used objects are sold , have been modernized ; but the market itself is very old and its traditional ways continue . Manuel tells of a cruel and sometimes comic struggle for survival in a corrupt world of double-dealing and police brutality which has existed for many years , although it has rarely been described in print . For Manuel , simply to work in the Thieves ' Market represents a kind of triumph . He was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded one-room apartments in the slums . He left school in the sixth grade , married in " free union " at fifteen , and was a widower with four children at twenty-eight . Before he set up on his own in the Thieves ' Market , he scratched out a living by working for anyone who would hire him : he was a vendor of lottery tickets , newspapers , and singing birds ; a shoemaker ; a baker ; a glass and leather worker ; a temporary agricultural laborer in the United States . This life was thoroughly disenchanting to Manuel : the shopkeepers and artisans paid him miserably ; Mexican movies , radio , and TV displayed to him the existence of a much better life ; he was strongly impressed by the standard of living he saw in the United States . By establishing himself in the Thieves ' Market , he is trying to rise from the position of a poor worker to that of a petty capitalist . And in the excitement of the market place he finds many things which help to soften the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a boy . It is satisfying to him to strike a good bargain , to handle money not his own , to keep up his daily hopes of getting rich quickly . For most of his life he was ragged ; now , dealing in second-hand clothes , he can feel that he has a large , if transient , wardrobe . He changes daily into " new " shoes , pants , and jackets . But Manuel Sanchez is an extremely complex person , far more so than this excerpt can reveal . Along with the qualities we see ? his shrewdness and pluck , his bravado and philosophical humor , his sensitivity to injustice and his desire to rise in the world ? go a strong belief in the limits of destiny and class . " To those of us , " he says , " who arc born to be tamale caters , heaven sends only tamales . " To know Manuel and the Sanchez family is to understand better what it means to grow up in a slum tenement in the heart of a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our attitudes and policies toward countries in Latin America ? and other underdeveloped areas as well ? where rapidly expanding rural populations are leaving the land and pouring into the cities , only to find that industry can not provide them with decent work . ( Twenty years ago , when Manuel was ten , there were 1.4 million people in Mexico City . Today , there are over four million . ) In the life of the Sanchez family we can find an illustration of the great gulf between the promises of the Mexican Revolution and its fulfillment . It is true that the expansion of the Mexican economy since the revolution has been impressive . Although the population has grown , the per capita wealth of the country has sharply increased since 1990 . Nevertheless , the disparity between the rich and poor in Mexico is more striking today than before , despite some rise in the general standard of living . In 1960 , 60 per cent of the population were ill housed , clothed , and fed ; 45 per cent were illiterate and 40 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Department of Commerce has tersely indicated one underlying reason for this situation : There appears to have been a considerable increase in the real per capita income since 1939 . However , most of the increase was in the form of commercial and industrial profits , and large sectors of the population derived little if any benefit from the enlarged national product . Even the best-intentioned governments face tremendous obstacles in the underdeveloped countries . Poverty does terrible things to the poor , and most of the people in MantleEs life are badly damaged human beings . Yet , with all their defects and weaknesses , it is the poor who emerge as the true heroes of contemporary Mexico , for it is they who are bearing the brunt of the nation 's industrial progress . Indeed , the political stability of Mexico is grim testimony to the great capacity of the ordinary Mexican for misery and suffering . But even the Mexican capacity to suffer has limits . Unless ways are found to achieve a more equitable distribution of the growing national wealth ? and a greater equality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect social upheaval in Mexico , sooner or later . Here is what Manuel Sanchez said . Illanuers Story F OR a couple of years now I 've been working at the Tepito market in Mexico City . I deal in second-hand stuff ? clothes , shoes , gold , silver , watches , furniture , bicycles ? anything that comes along . In a way , you take a chance in this kind of work , but it 's never been really bad for me . On the worst day I make at least twelve pesos ( one dollar ) , enough for food . Ever since my mother took me to the market as a small boy , I liked the atmosphere . It is colorful , like the village markets where buyers and sellers know each other , tell jokes , and bargain . There is nothing impersonal here , the way it is in Sears , Roebuck or the Palacio de Hierro , where the clerks do n't dare chat with the customers . There , they only tell you the price and do things mechanically and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The customer does n't have a chance to defend himself . Since I 've been working at Tepito , some people have a poor opinion of me . They think that everything in that market is stolen goods . Butthat 's a lie , yes , a lie . The truth is that only about 50 per cent of the stuff sold is crooked . But it 's only little stuff ... the handful of tools , the dust mask or rubber boots that the workers rob from the factories , or a bicycle someone stole on the fly . If it 's a radio , it 's the kind that 's practically falling apart . Like everywhere else in the world , the real good - hot " merchandise ? the fine radios and machinery ? is bought up by the big capitalists . Nobody around Tepito has the money to buy the good stuff . When I know something is stolen , I usually do n't buy it . In my type of work you have 10 be somewhat of a psychologist , to know whom you 're buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cop , a dope addict , a prostitute , or an innocent . Ten years ago there was more " hot " merchandise in the markets because the police were not so active . Now they consider the place a gold mine and are on permanent duty . Even on their clay off they come to the market to see whom they can screw . It 's a business with them . They know 68 MANUEL IN THE THIEVES ' MARKET that just by putting one of my buddies in the patrol car , they can make themselves twenty , thirty , or fifty pesos . I got my start in the market when I came back from my trip to the United States as a bracer ? , an agricultural worker . I was working at my old job in the glass shop . One Monday I came in late and my boss decided to dock me for a week . " O.K. , " I said , " big deal . " and I got up and left . To kill time , I went to the Tepito market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of gabardine pants over his shoulder . lie was a peddler , a dealer in second-hand goods . He told me I was an idiot to work on a job when I could be making more money selling stuff in the market . I thought it was risky , today you make something , tomorrow nothing , and maybe I would n't be good at it . Actually , I had some idea of what it was like to work in the market , because I used to watch my mother and my uncles and other peddlers hawk their wares , and I knew the old-style method of buying and selling . So when Joaquin told me to try to sell the trousers for at least fifteen pesos , while he was buying op more stuff , I agreed . A boy came down the street and stared at the trousers , and I said , " Come on , pal . F11 give it to you cheap . " " Well , yes , " he says , " hut I have no money . I 'm selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxurytype " Haste " ? very nice . He wanted 125 pesos for it , and we bargained back and forth . I was n't embarrassed at all , I took to selling right away . It was easy . Finally , to make a long story short , I gave him forty pesos and the pants , and he gave me the watch ; so the watch came to fifty-five pesos . I offered Joaquin his fifteen pesos for the pants . " No , " he says , " do n't be a crook , pal ! Only fifteen pesos and you took in a great sale . " Then he laughed . and said , " O.K. , say no more . It 's your debut here in the market . Beginner 's luck . " Well , one of the dealers nearby ? we call them , ' coyotes "  - -  wanted to buy the watch . I thought I 'd ask seventy-five pesos for it and make a fast twenty pesos profit . But before I opened my mouth , Joaquin says , " Two hundred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered to pay one hundred . I was ready to sell , but my partner , Joaquin , said , " What ? Moron ! Hold your horses . " So I wait with my little watch , see ? and we walk away . Then the coyote comes along behind us and says , " So as not to be screwing around , I 'll give you 125 , yes or no ? " Well , he finally gave me 170 for the-watch . I made 115 pesos on it . In a few seconds , I made more than I earned in a week of hard work at the shop . " What am I working like an idiot over there for ? " I said to myself . Then and there I decided to quit my job . FEAR OF THE LOUDEST 1 - L I K ED selling . . . I liked the freedom . I had time for myself and no one bossed me around . Up to that time I had been blind , and could n't see farther than my nose . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a job ! Even when it does n't pay off , a worker does n't try another road or look for other horizons . but goes on doing the same thing . My father was like that , until he began raising singing birds and pigeons right here in our tenement . . . that 's when he started getting ahead . I 'm going to see to it that my sons are n't workers . If they ca n't be professionals , I 'll put them into some little business . That 's the only way they can earn money without being dependent on others . I figure this way : if I start working right now on a job , where I make the legal minimum wage of twelve pesos a day , I could never raise my living standard . Out of the twelve , I 'd have to give at least six to my children , and a man ca n't live on six . I could n't pay rent , eat three meals outside the house , buy shoes or clothes or anything on six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need to buy medicine for a hundred pesos ... any good medicine costs at least that ... I 'd have to borrow the money and pay it back at fifty centavos a day . At that rate it would take over six months to pay for the medicine and most likely in that time someone else would get sick . It 's just a vicious circle and there is no way to get ahead . The only time I lost in the market was when I bought a thing called a mimeograph . I did n't even know what the gadget was for , but , well , I was real impressed with the word , see ? 1 thought : With a name like that it must be worth something . The character selling it spotted me for a moron . He made a fool out of me , one of the many times it happened . He says to me , " See this little machine ? I want only two hundred pesos for it . " " Holy Christ ? " says 1 , " so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money . VII give you fifty . " We argued back and forth and I started to change my mind . I was getting a presentiment . " Maybe this damn thing does n't even work and I 'm talking my head off . The truth is I do n't even know what that pile of junk is good for . " " O.K. , " the guy says , " over here with fifty . " There go my fifty pesos . The first customer offered me thirty pesos , the next was willing to give me twenty-five pesos . And that 's how it went until after fifteen days of lugging around my famous mimeograph , they were offering me ten pesos . I finally left it in the market administration office and abandoned it there . But usually I make good money in the market ... more than I had on any job . But it was n't all easy going at the market . The market administration sometimes asks traders for their credentials , to force us to join a union , see ? The market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to sell second-hand clothing in the Thieves ' Market they ask vou for a Social Welfare card , a Department of Health card , a union card , your police record ! I have no cards and I 've had a lot of arguments about it . I resent it , it makes me rebellious , you know what mean ? There I have my merchandise spread out on the floor and the guards come and want to take it away , so I argue with them , see ? There are no permanent places for the peddlers in the market ? the one who gets there first gets the spot . It 's like those cowboy pictures ? when they open the market doors , we all race in like horses . One Saturday I had a violent argument over my spot , and then the guard comes over and squats down to take the cloth with my merchandise on it . " You can pick this up at the office . " he says . " You do n't belong to any organization and you do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The market was n't built for you sons of bitches or for the organizations . " " Go talk it over with the superintendent , " he tells me . " No , " I say , " he 's just here to collect money for the government . The Constitution says that nobody can prevent another person from working honestly . Why should he count for more than the Constitution ? You touch my things and I swear kick the stuffing out of you . " We use strong language here at the market . The one who hollers the loudest is the one who is feared the most . Once I had to do something that disgusted me . I had to kick a guy . In the market , we are all bravery 's , tough guys , and whenever I was making a deal , this bravero , " Whitey , " would come over and stick his nose in and would get the merchandise away from me . He tried to lord it over me and when I asked him not to butt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fight and held back . Finally , one day I was closing a deal and had the goods in my hands , when this guy , Whitey , took out the money and paid . He said . " Let 's have the goods . " " What do you mean ? I 'm the one making this deal . Who the hell told you to pay for it ? " " Give it to me or I 'll take it ! " says he . " I 'd just like to see vou . " And then , wham ! let him have one right between the eyes . He dropped . He got up and I caught him against the wall and kept hitting him . I knocked off his eyebrow with one punch . He tried to kick me and that made inc blind mad . When he was on the ground T kicked him and his ribs made a funny sound . " Poor guy , " I said to myself , but there was the whole bunch from the market around us and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a jackass and they 'd keep starting up with me . Even though it was repulsive to me . I kept kicking him , not trying to kill him , of course ? I did n't even aim at his face , it was already covered with blood . Finally he said , " Enough , enough . " I did n't give him back his money and he never tried anything with me again . THE POLICE PICK FLOWERS M EXICANS ? and , I think , everyone in the world ? admire the person " with halls . " as we say . The character who throws punches and kicks , without stopping to think , is the one who comes out on top . The one who has guts enough to stand up against an older , stronger guy , is more respected . If any so-and ? so comes to me and says , " Curse your mother , " I answer . " Curse your mother a thousand times . " And if he gives one step forward and I take one step back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pile on and make a fool nut of him , then the others will treat me with respect . In a fight , I would never give up or say , " Enough , " even though the other was killing me . I would try to go to my death , smiling . That is what we mean by being " macho , " by being manly . Life around here is more real than among people with money . Here a boy of ten is n't scared off at the sight of a female sexual organ . Nor is he shocked when . he sees a guy lifting someone 's wallet , or using a knife on a man . Just having seen so much evil at close range makes him face reality . After awhile , even death itself does n't frighten us . We get our bruises in the struggle against life at a very early age , see ? And a scab begins to form . It never disappears , 74 MANUEL IN THE THIEVES ' MARKET like a blood scab , but remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow and another scab , until it gets to be like a kind of armor which makes us indifferent to everything . Two or three times I bought hot things from crooks . It was risky , but if things were bad with me financially I 'd think over the possibilities of getting into a jam and take a chance . But most of the stuff was not worth much . I was n't lucky all the time , even when I was acting within the law , One time I bought a radio chassis ; it worked but it had no case . I bought it from a peddler for fifty-five pesos and since we peddlers do n't cheat each other , I did n't even test it . I Mt the market and this cop grabs me , the one we call " The Bird . " He 's a guy who is n't good enough even to be a cop . He is very fat and always has one cuff of his pants higher than the other . His coat is so greasy you could scrape it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he became a cop he gives himself all kinds of airs . " Let 's see the bill of sale . " he says . " Look , " I say , " it has no bill of sale because it 's just a chassis . " " Get in , you bastard , " he says . He had three crooks in his patrol car already . We drove off and I heard the crooks bargaining with him , He wanted five hundred pesos from the first one and two hundred from the second one . We made several stops so the crooks could collect the money . He let those two go . To the last one , The Bird said , " O.K. , kid . It 's a long time since I picked a flower in your garden . Let 's get tip-to-date , what do you say ? " This guy says : " No , boss . I 've been in bad shape - . really bad off ... I have n't been out to work at all . " " Well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , get out and get me twenty-five pesos . " When we got to the precinct , The Bird says to me , " You know what the story is for you ? Two hundred pesos . " " Well . what do you know ! " I say . " Justice is progressing ! You let the guy who is really a crook go for twenty-five and for this dumb jerk who is trying to earn a living , the rap is two hundred . " So I offered him fifty pesos , all I had on me . " All right , all right , let 's have it and get the hell out of here . " Once 1 was really caught red-handed by the police and it cost me plenty . 1 did n't know what I was getting into that time . I had a partner by the name of " The Bull , " and we had money in our pockets then . What with the merchandiseand cash , The Bull and I had about ten thousand pesos . We were on the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelling : " Buy old clothes cheap . . , take something home .. right over here , . ? " There I was shouting my head off when Macario , the janitor 's son , comes over . He was an old friend of mine and had married a girl of the Casa Grande tenement where I live . He looked real beat , his clothes all patched , flat broke , because he had n't worked for a long time . We had worked together in the leather factory and I always knew him for an honest person . " Manuel , " he says , " damn it , lend me something for today 's food ? lend me five pesos , brother , can you ? " " Sure , Macario . " I thought : What can this poor devil do with five pesos ? Five pesos , so easy to get and so easy to spend . . " Look , Macario , " I said , " take ten pesos . God has been good , maybe tomorrow I 'll need you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , Manuel , I almost forgot the main thing I came for . Do you see the guy in the red cap over there ? His wife and the wife of another guy were going to set up a dressmaking shop , but since this fellow drinks and got drunk for fifteen days straight , his partner made off with the machines and five thousand pesos in cash . The only thing left was a batch of cloth they had bought to make aprons . They want to sell it . " When it 's a matter of business , I get suspicious right away . I trusted Macario but , you know , just in case , I went through the usual routine of asking questions . " No , Manuel , hell ! This boy works in the tannery with me and I guarantee he is honest . " I talked it over with my partner and we decided to buy the cloth at one peso a meter . There were 1,800 meters and I had to go to pick it up . When I got to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink . His mother was there , an old , respectable , white-haired lady . There was the cloth , brand-new and all tied up with steel strips . I chatted with her for a while , then I came out with it . " Look , lady , talking straight now , " I say to her , " are n't ... maybe ... is n't this stuff hot ? You know , if something 's wrong , the cops come screwing around . Look , I really do n't want to get into trouble , lady , sincerely . " She got red in the face : " Sefior , if you have any suspicions you just better not buy it . We are poor but honest here ! All of you in the market are suspicious . The lion thinks everyone is like himself . " She really let me have it , " O.K. , lady , do n't get mad . If they 're hot , I 'd buy them anyhow . But you have to tell me where they 're from , because if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show up . I 'd go to Toluca or to Pachuca to sell them . I 'm not asking because it frightens me . Nothing frightens me . The dead do n't frighten me . " I was thinking that if she told me it 's hot , I would n't touch the stuff . I just wanted to get the truth out of her . But she convinced me it was really straight , see ? So I bought it . Well , there we were selling the cloth . " Come on and buy it at 1.50 a meter . Cloth for sale , cheap ! " A man comes up and buys six hundred meters . " Oh , son of a bitch , " I say , " nine hundred pesos in one damned swoop . We 're going to make money here . " I started shouting , " Cloth here , two pesos a meter ! " That morning we sold over one thousand meters ! In the afternoon Macario came to help us sell , but he was timid . " Shout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't be afraid . I suppose you 're ashamed . . be ashamed of stealing , not of selling , brother . Look , business is fun , it 's more fun than working . Yell a little . " All the ladies were out buying their little chiles and tomatoes . By six , I had 1,800 pesos in my pocket . 44HE REALLY WEARS PANTS " A T THAT time I was eating at a certain cafe , where I was a friend of Gilberto and Carolina , the owners . As soon as I turned the corner to go to the caf ? , a man embraces me . Now we 're really screwed ! I tell you I can smell a cop . I had never seen that agent , but right away I knew . He asked about the cloth , all right . He held me close to him and we kept walking toward the patrol car . The cops had been waiting for me at the caN all day , but Carolina had n't sent anyone to warn me because the police would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot and I still do n't . The cop said , " Well , if it 's not what we 're looking for , please excuse me , but in our line of work we make lots of mistakes . " I was surprised . The cops are so arbitrary and here was such a decent bastard ! What stuff is he smoking ? I wondered . He got me into the police car and I kept explaining how I got into the cloth deal , " Ay , Manuelito , " he says , " it 's going to be damned messy , because the creditor wants the cloth or three thousand pesos , and we want two thousand . " " Ay , no , " I say , " no , then there 's no way out and I 'm screwed . " " No , " he says , " it 's not worth it , Manuel . Think of the consequences . You 'll get a prison record and then ... just for a few pesos that you could dig up somewhere . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ! In my whole stinking life I never saw five thousand pesos . " Well , there we go , off to the police station . On the way they picked up a few other friends , some pickpockets . They took their money and let them go . My cop friend kept talking . " Look , " I say , " take me to the creditor , the owner of the cloth , and let 's see if I can convince him to let me pay it off little by little . I 'll give you guys something too . You do n't work for free . " " We ca n't make deals hike that , " he says . Then I thought of Abram , my father 's cornpadre , who worked in the police station . I began to talk about him to the cops , hoping it would do some good . I was terrified because never in my life had I been in a jail . They said I would have to go in for a while . When I got there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had 1,800 pesos in my pocket but I was n't going to give it to those bastards . " Look , " says the guard , " inside they 're going to shake you down and take everything you 've got . " " Sure , sure , but I have n't a thing , not a thing . " I was well dressed , see ? I had on my gabardine pants , a good shirt , and a windbreaker. - Well , they opened the door of the cage and inside I went , scared to death . There was a bunch of evillooking characters there , the worst collection of faces I had ever seen . " Madre Santisima ! " I thought , " how am I going to take care of these bastards ? Let 's see if I can impress them . " I came in , angry , real angry . Inside I was shaking but I looked mean . They had to think I was real wild . I see this guy sitting on the floor , and wham ! I give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son of a hitch ! " " Hey , you bastard . . ? what . . . " " Shut up ! " f give him another kick . " Shut your trap . Did n't you hear me .... move over . " He moved over and the others made room for me . I was saying , " Cowards ! Fags ! Stoolies ! " I punched the wall , and kicked , see ? I punched the door . I looked furious . " Hey , what 's eating you ? " one of the guys asked . " What the hell do you care ? Am I asking you ? " 76 MANUEL IN THE THIEVES ' MARKET " Cool off . Maybe I can help you , give you advice , see ? I 'm an old guest here . I know all their tricks . " I kept acting real angry . I take out a cigarette and light it , and I notice another guy who looked even meaner than I. I saw I was getting on his nerves , so 1 said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smoke ? Have a cigarette . " I passed them around . The ice was broken , and I felt safer . Then a guy comes over , a powerfullooking fellow , and says , " Hey , friend , Why did they bring you here ? " " Look , " I say , cranking myself up , putting it on thick , because they have their class distinctions too . " I had fifty sewing-machine heads , I had television sets , radios , everything . . and that son of a bitch , the one who sold them to me , turned me in . They just took everything , brother , and I 'm out 100,000 pesos . " I had to give myself class because they have more respect for you that way . I noticed a guy there , lying with his face up and his legs spread , like a compass . His testicles were all swollen from the beatings the cops had given him . Every tittle while he 'd say , " Please , boys , face down . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please . " Face up or face clown , he could n't bear it . His face was all split and he had marks from the pistol butt they hit him with . Really heartbreaking , that poor guy . Then one guy said , " You know , I was in The Well for two weeks , pal . " That 's a prison called " El Pozito , " the little well . All you have to do is say " El Pozito " to the pickpockets around here and they cry . You know what they do there ? They tie their hands behind their back , tie up their feet . and say , " Was it you or was n't it ? " and wham ! a punch in the stomach , but hard , to knock out your breath . Then they throw them into a well of filthy water , full of horse urine , and then when they 're half-drowned , half-dead , they take them out and do it again . This guy who said he was in The Well went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For ten days I did n't eat or drink a thing . They did n't even give me water ! You know why ?

But I wo n't ! I wo n't talk ! I 've been here fifteen days and every night they take me out . " You know , I admired that guy . He really wears pants ! He had that Mexican courage that I think does n't exist any more . I was there fifteen minutes when they came to take him out . Just as the door closed , we could hear them hitting him . He came back looking yellow . " Not a thing , pal , " he said , " and they 'll kill me but they 'll get nothing from me . " All this time I was wondering when my turn would come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there was my friend , Abram , talking for me . I finally offered the cop a thousand pesos to let me go , otherwise I 'd get myself a lawyer . Well , that got him . Because if he did n't take the thousand , it would go to the lawyer . So he said , " O.K. , just because of Abram and all that . Let 's go and got the money . " I had the money in my pocket but they did n't know , see ? So he drove me to the caf ? , and I asked Gilberto to lend me five hundred pesos . I dropped my roll behind the counter , so he could see it , and right away he took five hundred from his pocket and gave it to the cop . He was to get the rest the next day . " O.K. , Manuelito , let 's go . " By that time he was calling me Manuelito . He even took me out for some lams before he locked me up for the night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pickpockets tell of their adventures . I really enjoyed being there with them .

The least I 'd earn would he one hundred pesos a clay . I hope to God to he able to achieve something like that someday . The fact is , I have a horror of being poor . When I see someone who has n't five centavos in his pocket , or who looks hungry , I am absolutely horrified . It makes me want to cry because I remember the days when I was that way . I have cried tears of blood because I did n't have money to feed my wife and kids , or to pay for a doctor . I really ca n't stand that life any more . The way I figure , if I 'm going to die anyway , I ought to treat myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know what will happen to me in the next world ? If I have ten pesos in my pocket , and feel like having a sweet , I 'll buy it , even if my other expenses are not taken care of . So that I wo n't be left with just my desires , eh ? I hate to deny myself little things . I have often asked myself , what is worth more at the end of one 's life , the things one has accumulated or the satisfactions one has experienced ? I believe that human experience is worth more , no ? Yes , the best heritage I can leave my children is to teach them how to live . I do n't want them to be fools ... I swear by my mother , I wo n't let them become ordinary workers .
