FOUR years ago , from the topmost balcony of Atlantic City 's Convention Hall , a middle-echelon staffer from the Democratic National Committee watched Lyndon Johnson accept the nomination . Today John Criswell is hardly better known outside Democratic politics , but he has nonetheless managed to become the most powerful figure within the Democratic National Committee and the individual in complete control of arranging the Chicago convention . <P> Criswell 's shadowy role is the surest sign that it will be a Johnson convention in form , if not in its decisions . The President posits his confidence in the Oklahoman on his ability to operate invisibly and with unquestioning loyalty-Johnson 's prime criterion for any political trusty and the secret of Criswell 's success . Thus in his two years as National Committee Treasurer , Criswell has regarded personal publicity as almost sinful . He makes a habit of not returning phone calls from the political provinces , and has exacerbated the estrangement of the national organization from state and local Democratic of ficials . Johnson once passed the word that the National Committee " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under Criswell 's regime , the party 's $2,000,000 deficit from 1964 has been erased . <P> Despite his obscurity and youth , Criswell at 36 is no stranger to politics or to Washington . He was a newspaperman before becoming former Governor J. Howard Edmondson 's press secretary . He moved to Washington when Edmondson had himself appointed Senator in 1963 but was out of a job upon the Senator 's defeat in a 1964 runoff primary . Jim Jones , a fellow Oklahoman working for Johnson , arranged a National Committee post . Jones was rising in status at the White House as an aide to Marvin Watson , now Postmaster General , and with his help Criswell moved up notch by notch in the National Committee . When a new treasurer was needed , Jones immediately recommended Criswell . " Can we trust him ? " Johnson asked . " He 's my roommate , " said Jones . These days , Criswell shares rooms with no man and confidences with only one .               @ @ @ @ @ @
