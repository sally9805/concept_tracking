txt The irony of Security Council discussions of the new Lebanese-Israeli issue is that the central question  --  Arab guerrilla activity  --  is likely to remain unresolved . This is really the pea under the shifting walnut shell in the discussions in the Security Council . The difficulty is that the United Nations in its present state can not wholeheartedly come to grips with the issue of guerrilla fighting . There are those who deem guerrilla warfare honorable , under whatever disguise , as a matter of popular causes . Lebanon disclaims responsibility for any fighting or sabotage that might be committed by Palestine liberation groups who are not legal residents of Lebanon . Israel says in effect , " You do n't expect us to stand around letting Arab terrorists kill off our population without doing something about it , do you ? " The result is a standoff which one sees vividly illustrated in the Security Council nearly every time the issue is condemnation of Israel for its retaliatory moves against Arab guerrillas who are alleged not to be there . It is not as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do . They advertise their own existence , when governments deny . Responsibility disclaimed Some of them enjoy having news correspondents write about them . There are an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 of these guerrilla fighters throughout the Middle East . Their numbers fluctuate from time to time since some are part-time fighters while others give their entire careers to the fighting . In recent months , non-Arab , left-wing students from Europe have been joining their ranks and beginning training in lesser military and medic roles . The largest number of Arab commando fighters is in Jordan . Both Jordan and Iraq are said to give military support to their activity , but evidence of such support has not turned up in Lebanon . Diplomats and observers in Beirut are quite aware that several guerrilla groups exist on Lebanese soil . It is common talk among them , and in several Lebanese // *Can UN get grip on guerrilla issue ? // newspapers which have objected to the presence of Syrian or Syrian trained guerrilla fighters in their midst . In Security Council debate , Lebanon naturally does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its soil . As of this writing it had not categorically denied this , either , in the debate but said that the guerrillas are a fabrication of the ingenious Israeli imagination . Lebanese Ambassador to the UN Edouard Ghorra stated that his country could not be responsible for the acts of the Palestinians . They have reached a point of despair that their problems will ever be solved , he said . In self defense , they have " taken up arms against the occupier . " As long as their rights are not restored , he said , they are potential and active commandos , and Lebanon would stand by the side of its brethren . Mr. Ghorra charged that Israel on Aug. 11 had attacked six Lebanese villages by air , using napalm and killing four civilians . Anti-Israel sanctions urged The Lebanese Ambassador said it was Israel 's hope to rule the Middle East economically . He said Israel had " milked the cow " of world Zionism " with relish " in order to obtain resources for such economic rule , under the slogan : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deplored simple condemnations of Israeli acts as inadequate . " Sanctions must be applied against Israel , " he said , adding that the strongest of condemnations of Israel should be devised and that Israel should be responsible for paying damages to compensate for what had been inflicted on civilians . Israel 's Ambassador Yosef Tekoan said that Israeli retaliations in Lebanon came in response to 21 guerrilla attacks into Israeli-held territory during the last month . He said that " Lebanese territory has become a base for terror warfare " as the " more militant of the Arab states exert growing pressure on others to expand the armed assaults on Israel . " World uninterested ? Such antithetical statements by Israel and Lebanon can not very well be proved or disproved under the United Nations observer system . There are those at the UN who would urge more stringent , more numerous , more effective UN presence in such war areas . But world conscience has not registered strongly enough within the UN to make this practical , competent sources indicate . Mr. Tekoah outlined in detail the dates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " seemed unable or unwilling to curtail these attacks . Israel had no alternative but to resort to self-defense , " he said . . Mr. Tekoah quoted an Egyptian Middle East News Agency report that one of the five saboteurs killed was a Syrian whose funeral was to be held in Damascus . Israel charges that there are Syrians among the terrorists in Lebanon . Ambassador Tekoah quoted a Lebanese daily " Al-Yom " as stating there was a " no-man 's land between Lebanon and Syria in which the fedayeen are now concentrated . " He quoted a Novak-Evans column from the Washington Post of May 19 which stated that " it has now been established beyond doubt that some Syrian-trained commandos in southern Lebanon are actually regular Syrian Army soldiers in commando uniform . ... Ostensibly , the Syrian-trained commandos called Al-Saiqa are in the rugged Mt . Hermon area to harass Israel from a refuge within Lebanon .... " History of aggression cited The Israeli Ambassador continued : " It is not by making preposterous allegations against Israel before the Security Council that the Government of Lebanon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an honest attempt to put its house in order , and by assuming the full responsibility of a sovereign government for barring its territory to aggressors against a neighboring state . " " No feats of propaganda , " said Mr. Tekoah , " can alter the basic facts . Arab aggression against Israel has been , from its very inception , an international crime . " This was true in 1948 when the Arab states invaded the nascent state . It was true in the ' 50 's and ' 60 's when terror warfare became the method of Arab belligerency . It was true in 1967 when the Arab states felt that the time was ripe for the resumption of full-scale hostilities against Israel . . . . " The failure of Arab aggression in 1967 does not bestow on warfare by terror , always criminal , always despicable and condemnable , an aura of respectability . " He ended by calling for Lebanon to observe the 1967 cease-fire by preventing attacks from within and across its borders by Arab terrorists .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
