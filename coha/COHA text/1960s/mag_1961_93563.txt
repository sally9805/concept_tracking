For reasons more sentimental than sensible , American tennis fans still go out each year to the West Side Tennis Club in New York 's Forest Hills to watch what has now become a purely Australian autumnal rite : the U.S. amateur tennis championships . This year saw little change in the ritual except that the American contenders present evacuated the premises even earlier than usual , leaving four foreigners to contest the semifinal matches in the men 's division and two Australians to wind things up . The only switch was that Aussie Roy Emerson , seeded third , knocked his first-seeded countryman , Rod Laver , out of the finals in straight sets . // Except for durable Darlene Hard , the defending champ , who turned up still visibly pale from the hepatitis that kept her out of Wimbledon , the U.S. women did even worse . Along with all of her compatriots but Hard , America 's third-seeded Karen Hantze was engulfed by the end of the third round by a tidal wave of tough new talent from overseas . // The presence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico , however , gave a new spurt of interest to the women 's side of the tournament . Where the men 's matches were for the most part one-sided affairs of net rush and smash , the girls in almost every case whaled ground shots from the baseline in tense , exciting rallies reminiscent of an earlier tennis era . As one Forest Hills fan newly converted to the distaff side explained : " What the boys are doing , I can read in the papers . Watching the girls is the way to use your ticket . " // But even though the foreign girls ' classic game was more exciting to watch , the girl who emerged triumphant in the end was an American with a man 's game . A husky Westerner who was once a dishwasher ( a fact , she says , that the nice-Nelly USLTA prefers she keep from the public ) , California 's 25-year-old Darlene Hard belts a backhand and rushes the net like a man . But her approach to tennis is far from masculine . On the court she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fingers . With almost embarrassing ease , Darlene the tigress gulped up the comparatively gentle lambs who opposed her : Mexico 's prettily poised Yola Ramirez ; Australia 's rawboned Margaret Smith , who lifts weights to keep in shape ; and finally England 's pony-tailed Ann Haydon. // There was no comparable calculated feasting anywhere in the men 's division . There highly touted lions like smashing , second-seeded Chuck McKinley kept making meals for overhungry lambs like unorthodox Whitney Reed , a self-confessed reprobate who plays near-championship tennis as though he needed a beginner 's lesson in form . // Sixth-seeded Frank Froehling III , who may someday prove the best of the lot in U.S. tennis , pulled up lame in a third-round match against Donald Dell and was gone . Dennis Ralston , the current brightest hope , pulled up naughty in Cleveland and never even got to Forest Hills . Of the other American seeded players only the bottom two  --  Jon Douglas , who was beaten easily in the quarterfinals by Britain 's Mike Sangster , and Ron Holmberg , who was tossed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semblance of dignity at the hands of players seeded ahead of them . And by the time Roy Emerson surprised the experts by cleaning up the court with his countryman Laver in the finals , dignity was about all the U.S. had left . After formally banishing the absent Ralston to limbo till the end of the year for his alleged misbehavior in Cleveland , the solons of U.S. tennis announced that deportment on the courts at Forest Hills had never been better .
