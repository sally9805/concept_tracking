 | " The rent Dr. Ferrier has asked of me for the offices is most reasonable . I am sure you will be pleased . All in all , I feel extraordinarily lucky in obtaining this practice , though you would have preferred that I practice in Philadelphia . But when you see Hambledon , and breathe its delightful fresh air , and meet the ladies of the town , and understand my good fortune , you will feel reconciled . A young doctor in Philadelphia , in his first practice , has a miserable time  --  as I have discovered . Jealousy on the part of established doctors is not unknown in Philadelphia ; they are very proud of their prerogatives . I did not meet with this attitude in Hambledon . They welcomed me , though they remain stiff with Dr. Ferrier because of his decision to leave them . Their position seems to be , ' We have forgiven you . Why ca n't you forgive us ? ' I find that very unreasonable . Do you not think so ? " ( Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider it very magnanimous on the part of the other physicians and surgeons to " forgive " Dr. Ferrier for a crime he had not committed , and she would also consider his rejection of them as " unpardonable . " What 's wrong with me lately ? young Dr. Morgan asked of himself . I never had these thoughts of my mother before I came here ; I was always the dutiful son , saying , " Yes , Mama , you are quite right , Mama , " when I knew damn well , in my heart , that the old girl was not only a prig but somewhat stupid , too , and pretentious . ) " I have already rented a fine rig with two spirited black horses . " ( He crossed out the " spirited " and replaced it with a less disturbing word . ) " Dr. Ferrier rarely uses any vehicles around the town , since his acquittal . He rides horseback , and has a wonderful stable of his own . " The young man considered . Then he deleted these remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a lack of " gentility . " " Mama , " he said aloud , " you are an ass . " His own remark shocked him for a moment , then he grinned and straightened his young shoulders under the excellent broadcloth of his suit . After all , it was time for the old girl to remember that he was no longer a child and no longer dependent upon her . I le removed the big gold watch , which had belonged to his doctor father before his death , looked at it , saw that it was almost ten o'clock , and that I ) r . Ferrier was calling for him soon . He replaced the watch in his vest pocket and straightened the heavy gold watch chain over his paunrhless front . I le concluded his letter with a flurry of affectionate remarks , then set out to recopy the edited paragraphs . Upon conclusion , it seemed to him a very priggish letter , itself , but just what his mother would expect . The unexpected , to her , was outrageous . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such as life , thought the young man , feeling exhilarated by his new objectivity . I low he 'd like to lure her into an obstetrical ward ! Or a VD one , for  | instance , not that she 'd ever heard of venereal disease and the surprising numbers of the " gentry " who turned up there regularly ! She had never heard of a D &C,; he was sure . Ladies did not have uteruses . Their children " emerged " gracefully from undefined regions . Robert had taken up , again , smoking " the filthy weed , " as his mother called it , since coming to Hambledon . So he lit a cigarette and relaxed , smiling thoughtfully through the window . It was a gorgeous June day , and the town was scented with its own roses and lilies and warm lawns , and the hearty odors of manure and the adjacent water and chimney smoke . Sun poured down the green and purple mountains in an avalanche of sparkling light , and there was a feeling of vivacity in the air which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river from where he sat in his hotel room on the fifth floor . It ran with color , violet and green and shimmering blue , curving and broadening about the town . He saw the ferry boat bustling across the water to the other side , and heard its tooting . He saw other busy river traffic . And there was that island fancifully called " Heart 's Ease . " Yes , it was heart-shaped , and the largest island in the broad river , but only a woman could think of such a sickening name . It lay quite deeply in the water , and Robert could see the tops of its many crowding trees and a glimpse of the gray granite walls that hedged it in almost completely . Dr. Ferrier 's brother , Harald , and the latter 's daughter , lived there all alone except for three servants . This was all young Robert knew of the island , except that Harald 's dead wife 's first husband had bought the island and had built what was called the " castle " on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enamored of the river and the island . He had never lived there , himself . But his widow had lived there prior to her marriage to Harald , and then for the two short years she had survived after that marriage . Dr. Ferrier had told Robert that much , but no more . He appeared reticent on the subject . He had mentioned that his brother had inherited a great fortune from his wife , or at least the huge income on it , for his lifetime so long as he lived on the island . The daughter had inherited only one hundred dollars a month pocket money . However , if Harald should tire of the arrangement , and leave the island permanently , he would receive only fifty thousand dollars and the money , in trust , would revert to the daughter . Jennifer ? Jenny ? Something like that . If Harald married again he would receive only twenty-five thousand dollars as a " wedding gift " from his dead wife . Mrs. Ferrier 's first husband had owned a tremendous steel mill in Pittsburgh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bloat the trust . Very , very nice . There had been no envy in Dr. Ferrier 's voice when he had given these facts to Robert . But his dark face had become sardonic , and closed , and Rvnert 's curiosity , always very lively ,  | was much stimulated . " Your much older brother ? " he had asked with pardonable avidity . " No , " said Jonathan Ferrier , and had appeared amused . " My younger brother . I 'm thirty-five . Harald 's thirty-three . " " The child must be just a baby , " Robert had suggested . Dr. Ferrier had seemed even more amused . He had changed the subject . No , he was not envious of all that money . He was a rich man , himself , inherited as well as earned money . His mother had been a Farmington of Philadelphia , and everyone knew that the Farmingtons were immensely wealthy . It was rumored that the Ferriers had come from France , or Belgium , over two hundred years ago and had always lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby , which he rented out . " Never dwscatc money , " Dr. Ferrier had told Robert . " Poverty is no crime , but the populace does n't really believe that . You can be a saint with all the heroic virtues , but if you have no money you 'll be despised . What does the Bible say ? ' A rich man 's wealth is his strong city . ' The old boys knew what they were talking about ! " It was " the strong city " of Dr. Ferrier 's wealth , the newspapers had more than hinted , which had procured his acquittal , for he had been able to " buy " the very best lawyers in Philadelphia , a city noted for its lawyers . Robert , in his hotel room , and waiting to be called by Dr. Ferrier for another tour of the town , thought about the accusations and the trial , which had occupied the first pages in the Philadelphia papers for months . Dr. Ferrier had been charged with performing a botched abortion on his young wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later . That had happened nearly a year ago . The defense had had to struggle for weeks to obtain an unprejudiced jury . Dr. Ferrier had testified in his own defense . He had not been in Hambledon at the time of the alleged abortion , but in Pittsburgh , and he had witnesses . I is had not even known that his wife was pregnant . She had never told him . No , he had not the slightest suspicion-of the criminal . " We had been married over three years , " he had testified calmly . ' 71u-re were no children . My wife did not want any . She had always had a delicate constitution . " He had hesitated here . " Yes , I wanted children ? No , I ca n't even hazard a guess at the name of the abortionist . My wife ( lied of septicemia , of course , as a result of the abortion . I am a surgeon . If I had performed the abortion , myself , it would n't have been botched , I assure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had sounded heartless to them . In fart , they had not liked I ) r . Ferrier , himself , with his tall thin arrogance , his tight dark face , his sharp " foreign " cheekbones , his polished  | black eyes , his air of disgust and impatience with all that was in that crowded courtroom , including the judge and the jury . He had shown no evidence of grief for his young wife , no sign of pity or regret . He had listened intently to the testimony of fellow physicians and sometimes his impatience leaped out upon his shut face . Septicemia , resulting f rc nn a bungled operation with lacerations . " I am a surgeon , " he had repeated . " There would have been no bungling . " His manner had been cc ' lit cm ptuous . And then he had appeared to be about to say something else , in his hitter impatience . However , he merely clenched his mouth tighter . The witnesses called for the defense had been distinguished doctors and surgeons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , could not have performed such a gross operation . He was , in lot , operating in Pittsburgh on the crucial days , under their very admiring eyes . Brain tumors . He had used the Broca method . He had been in Pittsburgh not only those days but the day before and two ( lays afterward , to be certain that his patients were out of danger . Five days in all . Dr. Ferrier had not appeared to be listening to those testifying in his defense . He had sat " like a stone , " said one newspaper , " staring blackly into space , " occasionally passing his lean hand over his thick dark hair . It was as if he had removed himself spiritually from that place into a solitude that could not be entered by anyone else , a solitude that was gloomy and soundless . Ile had been acquitted . The jury , reluctantly , had had to believe the witnesses for the defense . There was no way around it . Still , the opinion remained that had Dr. Ferrier not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have been found guilty . ' ! ' lucre were even some vile rumors  --  which did not appear in court ? that Dr. Ferrier had deliberately " bungled " the operation so that his young wife , only twenty-four , . would die . So he remained , in many eves , a double murderer : The murderer of a young woman and his own tinhorn child , three months an embryo . Among the many so fiercely convinced was his wife 's paternal uncle , Dr. Martin Eaton , a much respected surgeon in Hambledon . This was strange to friends , for Dr. Eaton had , before Mavis ' death , been deeply fond of Dr. Ferrier and had regarded him as a son , with pride and admiration . Mavis had been brought up from childhood by Dr. Eaton and his wife , Flora , after her parents ' death . They had finally adopted her , for they had no children of their own . I ) r . Eaton , a tall stout man of sixty , had sat grimly in the courtroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Ferrier , and with open hatred . When the jury had returned with their sullen verdict of " Not Guilty , " Dr. Eaton had stood up and had desperately shouted ,  | " No , no ! " Then he had turned , staggered a little , and then recovering himself , had left the courtroom . He had returned to Hambledon that night and had suffered a stroke , from which he was still recovering . Hambledon sympathized with him with real compassion . Yes , thought Robert Morgan , again glancing at his father 's watch , there were surely " currents " still in Hambledon . No wonder Dr. Ferrier wished to leave . Someone knocked on the door . Dr. Ferrier was waiting below for Dr. Morgan . To Robert 's surprise Dr. Ferrier was not on horseback as usual , but in a handsome phaeton drawn by two of his wonderful black horses , wild-looking beasts with white noses and untamed eyes . Race horses ? Robert thought with nervousness . Surely not . IIc and his mother ( lid not move in horsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evils of racing , " as his mother called it , was when he had recklessly accompanied some classmates to a track , where he had unaccountably won one hundred and twenty dollars on a bet of twelve . ( He could not remember the name of the horse now , and he was doubtful if he had known it then . But someone had once told him his lucky number was five and so he had bet his money on a horse with that number , though the colors of the jockey were two he nauseously hated , pinkish gray and liverish purple , they reminding him of the anonymous guts in the autopsy rooms . It had not been what was generally known as " a fiery steed . " In fact , its languor at the post had been obvious to everyone , except himself , and he had evoked roaring laughter at his choice . But ridicule always made Robert stubborn , so he had placed his bet , and had won . It had been a happy June day , he remembered , a day like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excitement . ) He smiled at Dr. Ferrier 's horses , then turned his face on the older man with sincere pleasure . He 'll do , thought Dr. Ferrier , though he 's still naive , and he 's a plodder . At any rate he 's honest and competent , which is more than I can say for a lot of hacks in frock coats and striped trousers whom I know . A Mama 's boy . I can make short work of that  --  I hope . Ile said , " Robert . I thought I 'd call for you in my mother 's phaeton. " 1Ie smiled bleakly at the younger man , who was only twenty-six , and whose stocky build made him appear smaller than his nearly six feet of height . Robert had sandy-red hair , thick and glossy , a round and boyish face pinkly colored , good wide blue eyes , a short and obstinate nose , a gentle mouth , a dimpled chin . He also had a small mustache , the color of his hair , and big shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so were his feet in their black and polished boots . The day was hot ; he wore thick black broadcloth and what Jonathan Ferrier  | usually described as a hard black inverted chamber pot , though it was only a New York derby . His collar , of course , was high and stiff , which gave his florid color an unfortunate enhancement , and his tie was black and fastened firmly with a pearl tiepin . To Robert 's surprise the usually austere and correct Dr. Ferrier was dressed as if for golfing , or for hunting or lawn bowling , in that his coat was a thin woolen plaid , his trousers light gray flannel , his shoes low . Even worse , he wore no collar and no hat . Yet his native air of hard elegance had not diminished for all this informal wardrobe . " Get in , " he said in his usual quick and abrupt manner . ( Robert 's mother had sternly told him all his life that no lady or gentleman ever appeared on a public street , walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " And take that obscene pot off your head , " said Jonathan Ferrier , as Robert cautiously settled himself on the seat with his host . " A day like this ! It must be nearly ninety . " The horses set out in what to Robert was a somewhat hasty trot . He removed his hat and held it on his knees . The warm wind rushed through his hair and lifted it pleasantly . " The horses , " said Robert , trying to keep trepidation out of his nice young voice . " Racers ? " " Hardly . But I do have racers , as I told you before . I 'm going to run two of them in the fall , at Belmont . Expect one of them to win . A stallion , three years old . Argentine stock . Should run the legs off most of the dog meat we have here . I bought his sire , myself , in Buenos Aires . " Robert had been born in Philadelphia . He knew Boston well , and New York . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met a man so insn  --  c. ; an . as Jon Ferrier , who had apparently visited all the great capitals of the world , and who had been born in little Hambledon . Robert had expected that he could kindly condescend to the " natives " of this town , and perhaps even to the famous Dr. Ferrier ; he had been warned by his mother to be " gracious . " Robert felt like a fool today . In fact , he had been feeling a fool for the past five days . He ought to have remembered that Dr. Ferrier had been graduated from Harvard Medical School and had studied at Heidelberg , and the Sorbonne , and that he was one of the small handful of surgeons who operated on the brain , which only yesterday was considered one of " the forbidden chambers . " Such a man would , of course , think it nothing at all to import a horse from Argentina for his own stables . " I thought we 'd forget the operating rooms and the hospitals today , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in frock coats who have never heard of Pasteur and Liston . But full of dignity and presence . They are slicing and sawing and grinding away at a great rate  | this morning , and if any of their patients survive I 'll be surprised . Only good luck and excellent constitutions kept their other patients alive after the general bloody slaughter . " " Why do the hospitals keep them , then , Doctor ? " " How many times do I have to tell you to call me Jon ? After all , I 'm not old enough to be your father . Why do they keep the hacks ? Well , one of them is the Governor 's cousin , and the other is Chief-of-Staff of the medical board at St. Hilda 's , our very fashionable private little hospital . Oil-well rich , on his wife 's side ; he bought his way in . " He chuckled with a dry and cynical sound . " In fact , he is operating on his wife 's sister ; ovarian tumor . I diagnosed it as probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Hedler thought , and thinks , my diagnosis ridiculous . he 's possibly just finding it out , or one of the interns is diffidently informing him , or even one of the nurses ! He 'd never know , by himself . " Robert was horrified . " And you say nothing  --  Jon ? " Jonathan gave him a brief hard stare . " Why should I ? Oh , a year or so ago I 'd have kicked up a stink . But not now . Why should I ? She chose I ) r . Hedler . He 's very impressive , and ladies love that , and he speaks with the authority of the ignorant . Presence . It 's true I 'm still on the staff , and the Board , but I 've learned , recently , when to keep my mouth shut . I recommend that to you , too , young Robert . At least for a few years . I had a bad time , myself , when I was first practicing and tried to introduce asepsis into the operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lots of hand washing and rubber gloves . If it had n't been for my family 's name  --  and money  --  they 'd have thrown me out . My mother had promised a wing at St. Hilda 's . The hacks still wear their frock coats and striped trousers and wipe their scalpels in a lordly fashion on their sleeves , or the nurses ' backsides , or whatever is handy . With a flourish . And they come , many of them , right from the dissection rooms . One 's an obstetrician . He 's delivering a baby this morning . " He laughed again . " The lady will be very lucky , indeed , not to die of puerperal fever . " " And there 's nothing you will  --  I mean , nothing you can do ? " " No . Would they listen to me , some of them , these days ? No . I 've heard it said that few would trust me to treat their dogs . " " lmpossihIcI " Robert 's pink face flushed with indignation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remotest idea , have you , about people , my boy ? You 'll find out , unfortunately . Look at you . A doctor who can blush . Remarkahic . Ilcre 's another thought for you : Despite what a surgeon or general practitioner clues , or does not , do is only part of the story of a patient 's survival . At least fifty percent of his good luck is due to himself  | and his faith in his physician . Did n't they teach you that in the great johns Hopkins ? " " Well , yes . " " But you do n't believe it ? " Robert was uncomfortable . " Of course I believe it . But still a hack , with all the confidence in the world , and his patient 's confidence in him , can literally commit murder in the operating room , or even in the ward . " " True . But those are the overt cases . I had a patient one time with a mere wen on his neck , and he died of shock , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . He did n't have any confidence in me . That was a few weeks ago , after ? " After the trial , thought Robert . " So , " said Jonathan Ferrier , " that sort of thing convinced me to get out of here . " " You have n't forgotten , though , that you 'll stay and make the rounds with me , and be on hand in the operating rooms ? " " I gave you my promise , did n't I ? " said Jonathan with impatience . The granite cobblestones shone as if polished in the sun . They were rolling down the wide green streets of the better part of the town , with large pleasant houses standing far back on warm and glistening lawns blowing with glittering trees . Here and there the lawns were splashed with brilliant flower beds , and here and there tethered horses drank at concrete watering troughs . Robert could hear the lazy slapping of screen doors in the distance , and the hissing of hoses as they watered the grass , and an occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands ; the tires on the phaeton 's wheels , rubber and thick , moved over the cobbles smoothly and the vehicle rocked just perceptibly . Irr the distance , Robert could see the mountains taking on a soft purplish cast , setting into relief the red roofs of rich houses , or the white walls . A lovely , prosperous town , this Hambledon . Robert already felt comfortable in it , and he also felt an eager affection for all who lived here whom he did not yet know . Jonathan said , " I hope you 'll like it here . I had ten applications , you know , for my practice . I interviewed them all . You were the last . " Robert colored with shy pleasure , and Jonathan again gave indication of his unaccountable amusement . " I 'm glad you selected me , " said Robert , wondering how it was that he was always amusing the older man , and why he was amused at all . " You were the best , " said Jonathan . " At least , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's very important to be harmless , if you arc a physician . Did n't old Hippocrates say that ? Yes . In fact , the greatest compliment you can say of us is that we did n't hurt anyone , even if we  | did n't help . I know an old fart who is very competent with the scalpel ? ingenious at times , inspired  --  but they have to give the patient ether before they get a look at him . A gargoyle , with a temper to match . He could kill with a look , and I suppose he already has . He 's harmful . He 's usually called in desperate cases , after the first surgeon is about to give up . Really miraculous . But harmful . " Robert had been told at johns Hopkins that it was not necessary for physicians to " indulge in levity " even among themselves , when it came to patients . Apparently Dr. Ferrier had not been taught that . Sometimes he intimidated poor Robert , who greatly admired him but still did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter way of speaking , and was often contemptuous . At first Robert had thought this all the result of the tragic trial , but others , in a whisper , had assured him that Jonathan had always been this way . " Of course , it is accentuated , now , but he was usually a cynical devil . " Robert was not certain that it was good for a physician to be cynical in the least , and too objective . He had a very tender heart . " Do n't be too anxious to embrace this damn town , " said Jonathan , as they rolled rapidly through the streets . " We have a lot of new-rich here ; oil people . The kind of precious vulgarians who refer to their houses as homes . ' Upstarts . Modesty is something they do n't appreciate or value . They think it is a self-awareness of inferiority , and then they stamp on you . We have a few authentic families , but not very many . Just an American town , just any town . Mostly populated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Good . You ought to be very popular here . I never could . That 's where the Church and I differ . Violently . " Robert could connect Jonathan Ferrier with many things , but not with any church . He was constantly discovering startling things about the other man , some of them disconcerting . " You  --  belong to a church , Jon ? " Jonathan turned his head slightly and gave Robert his unpleasant stark grin . " In a way . Why , does that surprise you ? The Ferriers had a hard fence to climb over two hundred years ago , when they came to Pennsylvania . They were  --  are  --  what you people call Papists . Nominally , I 'm a Catholic . But I have n't been to Mass for years . You see , once I was as downy-headed as you , Bob . My fellowman soon disillusioned me . I was seventeen , then . You are nearly ten years older than that . How in hell can you he so innocent ? " " I 'm not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonathan was highly amused again , and chuckled that dry chuckle of his . " You surely had some of the nurses , and perhaps some of the trollops of the town , did n't you ? " Robert 's too ready color flushed his face once more . He thought of his  | mother . He was certain she believed him virginal . He remembered the quick and awkward episodes of the past few years , and it embarrassed him , now , to recall that he had always closed his eyes so that he would not see the women 's faces . He could feel Dr. Ferrier watching him , but he stared obdurately at the thin sunburned hands that held the reins so surely . " I once had an intern from a Methodist medical school , " said Jonathan with happy remembrance , " who could never bring himself to utter the word vagina . ' He preferred to call it the private parts . ' There 's nothing , " said Jonathan , " less private , in a hospital or an operating room , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to remember that  --  er  --  women have their reticences , " said the unfortunate Robert . " Do they now ? " said Jonathan , raising one of his thick black brows . " If there is anything less reticent , or modest , than a woman I 've yet to meet it . A woman in heat can make the most uncouth man seem like a choirboy . " " I suppose you 've had a lot of experience , " said Robert . " Good ! You are n't all custard , are you , Bob ? That 's one thing I wanted to be sure of ; I was a little afraid , sometimes , that you were too gentle for the bloody arenas we call hospitals . " " I was considered very competent , at Johns Hopkins , " said Robert in a stiff tone . " Hardly a custard . Besides , my father was a surgeon , too , and before I even studied medicine I watched many of his operations . " " And did n't faint once , I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really like you , Bob , and I 'm notable for not liking people . You must cultivate a sense of humor . Never mind . Do you know where we 're going today ? To watch birds . " " Watch birds ! " " It 's too nice a day to watch people . You should watch people only during murky weather , or storms , or when rivers rise , or houses burn . Very revealing . You see them at their worst , naked . Yes , I did mean birds . " He indicated , with an inclination of his head , the strap across his chest that held a binocular case . " You never watched birds ? " Birds , to Robert , were somewhat lovable vertebrates who sang in the spring and had feathers . He could not tell one from another , except for the robins and the cardinals . His mother spoke of " their dear little nests , " and had once told him , when he was a child , that birds had been created expressly by the anthropomorphic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had no being of their own , no joy in life of their own , no celebration in living , no identity . It was obvious to her that they had eggs , but Robert doubted if she knew that they had a sex life also , which produced the eggs and the new , vital creatures .  | She had evidently believed that they begot as flowers beget , via pollen . Robert , remembering , decided that his mother was a trifle hard " to take . " Was she one of the fools of whom Ur . Ferrier had spoken ? Possibly . Probably . Robert felt new irritation , and did not know its source . Always , he had been the solicitous and tender only son , the only child , devoted to his mother . This now seemed puerile to him , and embarrassing . i lc thought of his father , and suddenly it came to him that his paternal parent had had a lot to endure , and there was no wonder that there had been no other child of that sterile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She calls our house " the home . " " What 're you scowling about ? " asked Jonathan . " If you do n't want to watch birds , we wo n't . " " I ) id I say that ? " Robert felt a thrill at the new vexation in his voice . lie was rarely vexed at people ; he was too kind . " I was thinking of something else . Yes , I 'd like to watch your birds . But why ? " " Why watch birds ? Some of them are still going north , even now . You can sec some fine and unusual specimens , if you know where to look . Why birds ? I do n't know exactly ; I always did , even when I was a kid . The old man was a great bird-watcher . He almost genuflected at the name of Audubon . We gave a park to the city ; at least my greatgrandfather did , on the outskirts . A bird sanctuary . Birds are restful . They never have their little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are rarely human in the best meaning of the term . It 's the same with other non-human animals . They are what they are  --  honest in their being . Solid in their being . But you never know what a man is . " He 's right , thought Robert , struck disagreeably by this truth . " I have six dogs and eight cats , " said Jonathan . " One dog in town . The rest on my farms . Each one a distinct individual , but honestly itself . You 'll never see a dog pretending to be better than he is ; you 'll never find a cat without self-respect . Even cattle are faithful to their nature . But coming down to that , man is faithful to his nature , too , almost always . Almost always he is a fool , a liar , a hypocrite , a coward , a pretender , a covert murderer , a thief , a traitor . Name any vice he does n't have . That 's his nature . It 's only when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out of character . " Robert had always liked his fellowman . He was naturally gregarious and trusting . His new irritability made him say , " You know , Doctor , that . onnels very sophomoric . " To his surprise Jonathan burst out laughing , the first genuine laughter from lion which Robert had heard . " What makes you think , " said Jonathan , " that sophomores are invariably softheaded and wrong ? Some of the blighter ' people I 've ever met were kids in preparatory schools . They sec things whole and they see them truly . Later , adults corrupt  | and blind them and tell them a pack of winsome lies , and dull their perceptions . Seventeen ends the age of innocence , unfortunately . Come on , now , has n't anyone ever betrayed you , or lied about you , or done some mischief to you , Bob ? " " Yes , of course . But what does that matter ? I keep my own hands clean . " " Cheers , " said Jonathan . Robert was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tie , and then his collar . He took off his coat . I 'm a prig ; he 's right , he thought . He rolled up the white sleeves of his shirt . The sun was very hot ; the soft shadow of trees and the dark caves they made of the streets were very refreshing . The houses were now more scattered and there were many empty lots , dusty and high with early June grass . The scent of stone and vegetation filled the quiet and shining air . There was a great deal to be said in favor of small cities and villages , Robert thought . At least they smelled  --  honestly . He saw that they were approaching the river and that Jonathan had turned the phaeton toward the River Road . He caught glimpses , between the houses and the trees , of that island which some fool of a woman had named " Heart 's Ease . " In fact , he saw the red-tiled roof of the " castle " clearly , brilliant in the sun , the walls hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembled shot silk , blue and full of bright purple shadows . " You remind me of Omar Khayyam , " said Jonathan . " Sophomoric , again , " said Robert . " What 's wrong with the old tentmaker ? If his truths seem worn and obvious it is because they are truths . What 's a truism ? It 's a coin that has had a lot of handling , but it 's a genuine coin , and it would n't have been handled so much if it had n't had verity . " " I bet you read him at least once a month . " This happened to be true , itself , and it annoyed Robert . " I do , too , " said Jonathan . " Do you want to know my favorite verse ? : " ' The moving finger writes , and having writ Moves on . Nor all your piety or wit Can lure it back to cancel half a line , Nor all your tears wash out a word of it ! ' " Robert was startled , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was also his own favorite . It had always been unbearably poignant to him and warningly tragic . Then he saw that Dr. Ferrier was laughing at him again , and now they were not only on the river road but across the water the island seemed only yards away .  | Hambledon had not despoiled its river frontage as yet with factories nd disreputable warehouses and shacks . When Robert remarked on his with pleasure Jonathan said disagreeably , " Just wait . We Ferriers nd our friends have stopped it so far . But we arc already being accused tf being ' unprogressive ' and ' standing in the way of The Future . ' The suture , apparently , will be complete ugliness , and utilitarian , if the progressives ' have their way . Let 's enjoy the beautiful , vanishing Amerca while we can . It 's on the way out to make way for the proletarian ult of drabness . " Robert nodded . " Or Karl Marx 's cult of ' for use . ' I-Iow he hated the ' arinerl Ile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities and hen the broad countryside , and he complained of all that ' waste land . ' Why , he asked , were n't the cities spread out over the countryside , so the masses ' could have little plots of land all their own . When it was brought to his attention that the land was needed to cultivate crops : o feed people , he waved it away as irrelevant . " " So , you learned something else besides how to perform autopsies and needless operations , " said Jonathan . " Now , why are you scowling ? Never mind . Old Marx was a plagiarist . He got all his ideas from the French Revolution of 1795 and the murderous Jacobins , who probably got their ideas from the Roman traitor , Catilina , over two thousand years ago . The idea of utilitarianism only , and the rule of the undisciplined mobs , is an ancient idea that goes back to the sons of Cain . Liberty 's a very fragile flower , indeed , and we 'd best enjoy it here in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be ? Young Bob , you 're awfully naive . " " Oh , that 's ridiculous , " said Robert , with the confidence of youth . " No one listens to Teddy Roosevelt , and his ' progressive ' ideas . " Jonathan grunted . " This is a new century . Yes , I know , it 's only ut . utiliii.tl man made marking of time . But I 've noticed something rely odd : New centuries do indeed mark themselves off from the past ones . I do n't believe in astrology , of course . But some madman in t ' hii .1go sent me ' the planetary aspects of the 1900s . ' Do n't recall his name . Anyway , he said this century would he known as ' The Prelude to Armageddon , ' or ' The Century of Tyrants and Disaster . ' Maybe . Maybe . Let 's move into this grove of birches . And look for birds , " and he ; rinsed at Robert .  | The grove of old birches was aromatic with sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The warm sunlight did not penetrate here . The air was as cool as a fragrant cellar . There were large stands of wildflowers and mushrooms , and everywhere sounded the voice of the river and the colloquy of busy birds . Robert , the city man , was exhilarated . He breathed deeply and listened . Jonathan held his binoculars to his eyes and swung them about , searching the tops of trees and the sunlit branches . " There ! " he said . " If that 's not a delayed grackle then I never saw one ! " He held out the binoculars to Robert who put them to his eyes and directed them at an indicated branch . He saw a large bird with a peculiar aquamarine beak and a quantity of brilliant feathers . But the binoculars were focused on a great wild eye , staring , mysterious , reflecting remembered forests and hidden wildernesses and the knowledge of ancient ages . Never had Robert seen such an eye before , which held secrets unknown to man , large , dilated , still , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , strangely , a trifle frightened as man is always frightened by the inexplicable . He said to Jonathan , but as though speaking to himself , " What we do n't know ! " " A born bird-watcher , " said Jonathan . " I never knew a bird-watcher who was smug . Or a zoologist who thought man was the crowning glory of creation . Or an astronomer who believed man was little lesser than the angels . ' " Jonathan snorted . " The Old Testament boys were cryptic . They never explained what angels they were referring to . Perhaps the ones who followed Satan down into the pit . " Robert stared at him curiously . " You do n't have a high opinion of your fellowman , do you ? " " The lowest opinion possible , " said Jonathan , with promptness . " After all , I literally know him inside and out . If you want to retain your good opinion of mankind , never get too close to it . Squat in your ivory tower and read poetry , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or mingle with people . Or , God help us , talk to them . " Robert was strangely oppressed . The sound of the river and the cries of the birds became too imminent to him , and now they had an ominous note . " Birds , " said Jonathan , " do n't like people . Neither do trees . Very perspicacious of them , is n't it ? We are seeing our last of our edible chestnuts though there 's a great flurry among chemists and such to find a cure for their present disease , which is killing them . One by one other species of trees will begin to die , as they died in China , when the press of populations moved too closely to them . That 's why  | Tina is so barren now . It wo n't be too long before America begins lose her trees , too , one species after another . No , they do n't like : ople , the old ones . " " You sound like a Druid , " said Robert , the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " and Jonathan was authentically . ave . " Remember , we were pagans before we were Christians , and e had a knowledge of the earth , then . So did the ancient Jews . " c smiled mockingly at Robert . " So , you know about Druids , too ? am beginning to have a respect for you , young Bob . " " Do you think I 'm illiterate ? " said Robert , with considerable new roger . " Even if my father was a physician he was a literate man and ul a big library ! " " A vanishing race , " said Jonathan . " The physician of the future will e a specialist , and what he 'll know of the nature of the body and to mind will he strictly circumscribed . Turn those binoculars on that ; mined island . It 's very interesting . " Robert obeyed , though automatically . He was too disturbed by his 0 ) ughts . Then he focused the binoculars . The glasses brought the island so close that Robert felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger than it appeared to the naked ye . It was truly heart-shaped , the widest and indented part rising out f. the blue water like the prow of a ship , the pointed end seeming most level with the river . He could see the granite enclosure clearly , nd the white walls of the " castle , " and the crowding masses of trees nd the brilliance of flowers beyond them on lawns . The red roof f the building flashed scarlet in the sun . A figure was climbing up the widest point , and Robert caught a limpse of blue . The figure appeared young and lithe , climbing with ase and vigor . It moved in and out through copses of trees , rising Icadily . Then it reached the highest point , just behind the granite nclosure . Suddenly it was completely revealed . A tall young girl toad there , staring directly across at the grove of birches , and her , ice , whitely luminous , glowed in the sunlight like marble . It was a beautiful face , exquisitely boned and delicately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair swung about it and fell the shoulders and below , held back by a red ribbon . The clear , ti'Itshed brow shone in the light , and the large crimson mouth . The lose was faintly aquiline . Robert noted this , but what demanded his acute ttention were her eyes . They were intensely blue and large and dense e  --  tth hl. - k lashes and arched with very dark brows like the gleaming v u-gs of a bird . So extraordinary was the blue of the eyes that the p.ukle of tItem seemed to fill her face , making it blaze .  | They were full of passionate and unequivocal hatred , directed at the grove of trees . The hatred struck at Robert and made him drop the glasses precipitately . " She sees us spying on her ! " he exclaimed . " Nonsense , " said Jonathan , taking the glasses and putting them to his eyes . " That island is almost a mile out in the water . She ca n't see that far . " He chuckled , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this grove , but she does n't see us . She ca n't . " He gave the glasses back to Robert . " Pretty wench , is n't she ? " Robert hesitated . He looked through the glasses again . The girl was still looking toward the grove . She was leaning on the granite wall , tensely . She was not only tall . She had a lovely figure , curved and graceful and slender . Her blue dress was simple , and open at the throat , and the sleeves came halfway down her arms . She wore a coarse brown apron over her dress , like a servant or a girl who worked in the barns . " I still think she sees us , " said Robert , with uneasiness . " She 's looking straight at me . And she does n't like it at all . " " A mile , almost , away , " repeated Jonathan . " I know . I swam it several times , there and back . The current 's very fast . No , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as usual . " " Who is she , Doctor ? " " My niece . Technically . " Robert turned to him , and stared . " What did you say ? Your niece ? How could that be ? The girl is twenty , or older . And your brother is younger than you ! " Jonathan was silent a moment . The fretted shadow of the birches trembled over his face , and it was bleak and hard . He finally said , " Technically , I said . My brother , Harald , married her mother , a Mrs. Peter Heger . From Pittsburgh , and Titusville . She was twelve years older than my brother . And that 's her daughter by her first husband . Jennifer . Or Jenny , as she 's usually called . " " She 's living there ? With your brother ? All alone ? " Robert blushed at his own words . Jonathan grinned , and Robert again wondered whether he liked or disliked the older man . It was such an unpleasant grimace . Jonathan said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . The people in Hambledon do n't think it 's nice at all . However , there 're servants there , too , three of them . And Jenny , apparently , does n't give a damn what people say . Her father bought the island and built that silly house there , called the castle , ' in a fit of honeymoon preposterousness . He left all his fortune to his wife , who was n't what you 'd call very  | intelligent to begin with . You can never tell what an infatuated woman will do with money , and Myrtle  --  foolish name , is n't it ? ? was infatuated with my brother . He 's a natural roamer , and an artist , and did n't have a cent in the world when he caught Myrtle 's attention . " Jonathan paused . " My father knew what he was doing . He divided his money between my mother and the , and left artistic Harald only a small , lifetime income , not enough for his exquisite tastes . He 's a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as all had artists think themselves . 11c 's elegant and ' sensitive . ' New Cubist , I think . I do n't know much about art . I only know 11m  --  Ad 's stinks . Ile never sold a painting in his life , but hr 's been all over the world . I suppose Myrtle was ? Godsend to him . Anyway , he married her and they lived very tapaly for several years together until she died . She had mitral stenosis , later , an infarction . I was her physician . " 1tobert had listened to all this intently . Jonathan 's voice , resonant and Mt to() pleasing at the best of times , had become grating and unpleasant , as if he were controlling deep laughter . " Why does n't the girl leave ? " asked Robert . " It  --  it must n't be nice for her . " " What ? On one hundred dollars a month , after she 'd been brought up like a princess ? Jenny 's a shrewd piece . And that island was her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It was her father 's . He died when she was quite young . " " I do n't suppose they like each other , your brother and  --  the girl ? " Jonathan laughed again . " There 's a rumor they like each other only too well ! In the town they call her ' Lilith . ' " Robert knew his Bible . He said , " Lilith ? Was n't there a legend that she was Adam 's first wife , or something ? ' Now Lilith was a demon . ' " He flushed again , his too-ready color . " I should n't have said that . " " You are n't offending me , " said Jonathan , with enjoyment . " I despise both of them , sweet Jenny , and Harald . Not that I listen to gossip , which is plenty in the town . In a way , I suppose it 's all right , their living in the ' castle . ' It should have been left to Jenny , anyway . The Servants arc there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , and disgust . He put the glasses to his eyes once more . The girl was still directing her hatred at the grove of trees . Then , as Robert watched , she bent her head and descended hack the way she had come and disappeared . He saw the white flash of her neck through the trees . " I still think she saw us , " he said . " No . Impossible . She was just hating Hambledon in general . She does n't go into the town very often . When she does , she often calls  | on my mother , technically her grandmother . They are great friends . But she leaves at once if I appear . I do n't think she likes me . " I wonder how many do ? thought Robert , and was embarrassed . " How about visiting the hermits ? " asked Jonathan . " They 'll be your patients , you know . You might as well know them . " His dark thin face was gleeful with a mirth that Robert could not understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , " said Robert . " Perhaps not today . " He was again very uneasy . " Why not today ? " Jonathan was suddenly very brisk . " They have three rowboats . One is always on this bank . Come on . Why are you rooted there ? " Robert did not know . He simply felt a reluctance to make the acquaintance of the ambiguous couple on the island . But Jonathan took his arm and firmly led him out of the grove . " I go over there at least twice a week , just for the fun of it , " he said . " There is n't much fun in my life recently . Do n't be stubborn . " Carrying his thick coat on his arm , Robert followed Jonathan . For some reason he set his hard black hat firmly on his head . They reached the bank of the river and saw that a rowboat with oars was pulled up on the thick grass . " Perhaps your brother is n't at home , " said Robert hopefully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How are you at row-ing ? " But Jonathan took off his jacket and lifted the oars , after the two young men had pushed the boat down into the water . " You can row back , " said Jonathan . " It 's wonderful exercise , and doctors need it . They get too fat in their pompousness . " Robert settled down in the boat as Jonathan strongly thrust the oars into the shining blue water . He had a new suspicion that Jonathan had intended this visit from the first , and his uneasiness grew . He told himself that he was not accustomed to " this kind " of people . All his life had been surrounded by people on whom one could depend , of whom one was sure . Good solid people , kind people , helpful , friendly people . Decorous , churchgoing people who always voted Republican and suspected " Papists " and Jews and " foreigners . " People who made Sunday calls and left cards and never swore or acted indiscreetly . People to whom adultery was only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women who were modest and not ambiguous , and never showed their ankles or uttered a naughty word ; men who wore frock coats on Sundays and carried canes and talked in modulated voices . I am certainly a long way from Philadelphia ! thought young Robert Morgan . He looked at the bareheaded Jonathan Ferrier . Jonathan was as  | strange to him as a resident of Tangiers or Constantinople . He had a " foreign " look , lean , hard , dark , hidden . He was also a " Papist , " by his own admission , or at least had been so . Of course , his mother had been a Farmington , and was a great lady . Robert dwelt heavily on that fact , to conceal his feeling of estrangement and his sensation that he had , in some way , found himself in an alien country where the old signs were written in hieroglyphics and not to be deciphered . Yet , Ilamhledon was only a small city . It was just that the Ferriers were " different . " French , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do next . They were unpredictable , and Jonathan Ferrier was more unpredictable than most . Sinister ? Robert thought of that , as the hot sun glared in his eyes and the water threw back brilliant ripples of light . Probably sinister . Was it possible that he was really guilty of his wife 's and child 's murder after all ? No , no . Of course not . A swell of water made the boat rock , and Robert clutched the sides quickly . " Not seasick , I hope , " said Jonathan . " No . But should n't we have called first to see if we 'd be welcome ? " " They do n't have a telephone . Myrtle could never stand telephones . She wanted the island to be very rustic . " Jonathan grinned , and his white teeth flashed at Robert . " If there is an emergency , they have a light , a lantern , to be lit on top of their stupid castle . ' I know . That 's the way they 'd call me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roust me out of bed . Or look for me in the hospitals . Do n't worry . Jenny and Harald are used to me rowing over regularly . " " It must be lonely for them . " Robert tried to talk over his anxious thr tights . " No . Not really . Harald 's an artist . Remember ? He likes his solitude . Ile says . And  --  Jenny 's there . " " A young girl . Does n't she have friends in Hambledon ? " " A few . But she 's surly by nature , and is n't very popular . She 's been much worse since her mother died . Did I mention that she detests me ? As for my brother , we 're not exactly devoted . Here , take the oars and try them out . " ' llte current was unexpectedly swift and the boat was pitching as well as rocking . The two men exchanged places cautiously , and even then Robert almost lost his balance . But Jonathan moved as easily and as lithely as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the oars . The sun was indeed very hot , and the current 1 .. d against the oars , so that Robert had to pull strenuously . He I , , ; . in to sweat , Ile glanced over his shoulder . The island seemed  | a long way off , the water bursting in little sprays against the prow of the steep bank . " You honestly swam this ? " asked Robert . " It 's easy . I 'm a good swimmer . But Harald ca n't swim a stroke . That 's the delicate artist for you ! " Robert began to feel his fair skin burn , and his nose . Sweat sprang out at the roots of his reddish-yellow hair , and under his chin and between his shoulders . Jonathan was not watching him . He was watching the island and the closed tight look was on his face again , and he appeared to have forgotten Robert entirely . " They have no gas , and no electricity , " said Jonathan , in an absent voice . " Myrtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , she was a fool . So , they have oil lamps and a barge delivers coal in the winter for that stupid pile of rock , and they burn nice apple logs , very expensive , in the fireplaces . And once a week the servants bring in loads of groceries in the boats . If they did n't get high wages they would n't work there , I can tell you . It must cost a fortune for all that pretentiousness . " The water lapped at the boat and the sun glittered on the water and Robert became hotter every moment . Jonathan looked at him critically . " You 're making better time than I do , " he said . " Swing around a little to the narrow tip of the island . There 's an opening in the enclosure there , and a path . " Again Robert looked over his shoulder . The island 's wide indented prow was looming above him , he was glad to see . He could smell the flowering earth and the trees and hear the silence above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat as directed . " Here we are , " said Jonathan , and stood up , crossed the seat where Robert sat and reached out . He caught a rope dangling from a pile , and tied up the boat swiftly . " All right ; we 're anchored . You 'll have to jump a couple of feet , though . " Before Robert could even stand in the swaying boat Jonathan had leaped onto the bank , which was steeper than the younger man had expected , and had much more of an incline . He jumped ; his foot slipped on the damp brown earth , and he would have fallen back into the water had not Jonathan caught his arm . " Steady , there , " said Jonathan . " And here 's the path . What ? Putting on your coat ? What for ? " The girl was standing on the climbing path . She looked down at them with an ugly expression on her beautiful face . " What do you want ? " she demanded . Her voice was lovely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her eyes .  | Robert was acutely embarrassed . Ile looked angrily at Jonathan . But Jonathan was smiling up at the girl , and a more unpleasant smile Robert had never seen before . " Why , Jenny , " he said in a coaxing voice , " did n't you expect me , as usual ? Jenny , dear , this is I ) r . Robert Morgan , who is taking up my practice . Bob , Jenny 1 Leger , my niece . Miss Jenny 1 Leger . " The girl glared down at them in silence , her hands on her hips . She did not acknowledge the introduction , beyond giving Robert a contemptuous glance . Then she swung about and left them , climbing rapidly like a deer , her long full skirts unfurling out behind her like a sail caught by the wind . Then she was gone . Robert replaced his hat . I le was angrier than ever . " I do n't think we 're welcome , " he said . " Oh , jenny never welcomes anyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to inform the cook that she has company for lunch . " " Lunch ? I  --  I do n't think I want to stay . " " But you must meet Harald , the genius with the paint brushes ! " Jonathan seemed ingenuously surprised . However , Robert was mistrusting him more and more . " Harald loves guests . He especially loves me . Come on . You have a tendency to grow roots wherever you stand . Do n't mind Jenny , the rustic plow girl . Badly brought up . That fool of a mother . If Jenny ever smiled , like a normal woman , the world would crack or the Apocalypse come down . Watch where you 're walking . This path is very steep and perpetually wet . And full of roots . I nearly killed myself , walking up it , when I got the dramatic light signal from the roof one night " I do n't like him at all , thought Robert with misery . He mocks everybody . I le mocks everything . He mocks me , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick rare trees and shrubs crowded along the path , and it was much cooler and the scent of earth was dank and musky in the shade . Jonathan climbed as easily as if the high path were a city pavement . He pointed out the trees and the shrubs . " Old Pctc was very lavish . He imported many of these vegetables . There 's even a cactus garden near the house ; they take in the cacti for the winter . Monstrous things , hut interesting . Those oil wells ) There 're even palms in pots , near what they call the tropical garden . Nothing 's been spared . I hundreds of thousands . Enough to  | build a new wing at the Friends ' Hospital for tubercular children . " His back was to Robert , and his voice had changed , become thin and vicious . " Not that I think a man should n't enjoy his money . ' I 'm not that much of a mousy prig . But he ought to have left something for the hospitals . And the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path to wipe his sweating face . He was again confused , and uncertain . Jonathan continued to climb . He said , " Myrtle promised me that wing . All big serious eyes and trembling voice . She never did , of course . In fact , I had trouble getting her to contribute one hundred dollars a year to the hospitals . Dear Pete ' had always counseled thrift , and Myrtle was thriftier than a razor , in spite of her general idiocy . Came by it honestly , Pennsylvania Dutch , not the rugged Amish , though . She 'd put her hand on my arm and look at me sentimentally , and sigh , and mysteriously promise a fortune . Very coy . But nothing in her will . I should have known . " Jonathan looked back and was surprised to see Robert standing on the path . " What 's the matter ? Are you flabby , at your age ? " " No . " Robert was more bewildered than ever . " Do  --  do the hospitals mean that much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Jonathan stood high on the path . He was silent , but Robert could feel the bitter penetration of his dark eyes . Then he said , " Once they did . But not now . " He climbed more quickly . Robert followed . Jonathan said , " Why so formal ? Did n't I tell you to call me by my Christian name ? " But he did not look hack . He seemed caught up in a gloomy aura all his own . His tall thin figure appeared to glide on the path , like a shadow itself . The path curved , and momentarily he was out of sight . Robert climbed , sunken in uneasy and contradictory thoughts . Now there was a sharp coolness between his shoulder blades . He shivered . He suddenly arrived into broad sunlight , clean and bright , and the dank scent was gone and the heavy odor of wet moss and slimy earth . He could not understand it , but he felt overpoweringly grateful . All was good again , fair again , filled with simple kindliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wicked , here in the sun of affirmation and purity . Yes , man was good , man was uncomplicated , man was the son of God ! He stood on level green grass , filled with warmth and ease . For a moment he did not see Jonathan Ferrier standing , waiting , at a little distance ahead of him on the lawns . Jonathan stared back at him curiously , and then after a moment he was sad . Poor devil . Poor , trusting boy . All was sweetness and light to him , was it ? Nothing was complex , elaborated , devious , evil , distressing , embroidered , treacherous , cruel , infamous  --  no , not to Robert Sylvester Morgan , barely out of the womb .  | Poor devil , thought Jonathan Ferrier again . I must help him . He must see reality before he is too old to take it with equanimity , and then go on . He called back to Robert , " Here ! " Robert started then , seeing the other man , he smiled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breather , " he said . He looked about him with pleasure . He saw the miniature castle at a distance on its lawns , with minute battlements and rounded towers and slit windows , and he was delighted at the white granite perfection , and not embarrassed as Jonathan was whenever he saw it . A little schloss , thought Robert . He saw a greenhouse , its glass windows sparkling in the sun , and small buildings that housed tools . He saw massed trees and formal small gardens and hedge and red bricked walks and little lily ponds and an old roofed well . There were spruces , too , and flowering shrubs , all fragrant in the water-clean air , all vivid with color . The river gracefully flowed about the island , lovingly enclosing it . Freshness came from little grottoes and winding paths , and white wooden arches bursting with climbing scarlet roses or blue morning glories . Nothing could be more charming , more appropriate , than all this , and it was no longer mawkish to Robert , not even the pretentious little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a still moat and a drawbridge . He listened to the riotous voices of the birds , and to the river , and the tootling of the busy ferryboat . How European in raw America ! The farther bank was high and green , and beyond it stood the grape-colored mountains , and it might all have been the Rhine Valley  --  which he , Robert , had never visited in his life but of which he had heard . He smiled hugely , and seeing that smile Jonathan frowned , then shrugged . He was somewhat disappointed in young Bob . If a man could not see preciousness at once , and grin at it , then there was not much hope for him . " Come on , " he called . Enchanted , Robert walked slowly toward Jonathan , turning his head from side to side to catch fresh wonders and beauties . He was not envious . He thought it all marvelous . Now he reached Jonathan , and in silence they approached the castle . The walk that led to it was slabs of white marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on each side crouched white stone lions , life-size . " What do you think of it ? " asked Jonathan . " Beautiful , " said Robert . Jonathan gave up . " A vulgar man 's dream , " he said . " At least , his dream of a dream . " But Robert did not hear this ill-tempered remark . The bronze doors opened before they could reach them , and a tall young man in a crimson velvet morning jacket walked easily down the marble steps to await them . Robert saw him in that clarified light of noon , long-headed , casual , smiling . He had a florid handsomeness , unusual in one so slight and young , and bright , ruddy hair , and excellent  | features , well-cut and candid . He came to them eagerly , as if they were the most welcome of guests , and expected , holding out his hands . Now Robert could see his large eyes , brilliantly hazel and shining with good temper , and his gay and attractive smile which revealed glowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pleased . " Jon ! " he exclaimed . " Jenny just told me . And , " he turned to Robert with that look of deep candor and open expectation . His voice was a lighter version of Jonathan 's . " My replacement , " said Jonathan . " Robert Morgan . Young Bob . " " Good ! I 've heard of Dr. Morgan . How do you like our town ? " " I like it . I like it very much , " said Robert with a fervency that made Jonathan smile wryly . He shook hands with Harald Ferrier . This brother was not " foreign , " nor odd nor secret . He was as transparent as the very sunlight and as warm . He made a stranger feel as if he were an old friend about to be strongly embraced . He made a man feel accepted and secure and at ease and more than ordinarily welcome . " I 'm glad , " Harald said . " I 'm very glad . Bully , as Teddy Roosevelt would say . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying for lunch , are n't you ? " Though his voice resembled Jonathan 's it lacked Jonathan 's resonance , and deep quality , its undertone of hard grittiness . Robert , lulled by all this good will , this tremendous kindliness and affability , hesitated . " Well , I ? " he said , and looked at Jonathan . " We came for lunch , " said Jonathan . " Do n't I , usually ? " " Except when you come for dinner , " said Harald , laughing . He winked without reason at Robert , as if drawing him into a delicious conspiracy against his brother . " We get a little bored here , without visitors . I 'm a gregarious fella ; I love company . It seems such an effort for friends to row across that water . Effete . " Robert murmured something . What nastiness had he been thinking of Harald Ferrier only a few minutes ago ? He could not remember . But he was ashamed . There was such joyousness about Harald , such simplicity and humor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marble squares , with four suits of armor arranged along the walnut walls . A dark wooden staircase with medieval overtones rose from the hall to a landing with a great stained-glass window . The hall smelled of the ages , a faint but pleasurable mustiness , and Robert saw hanging banners in various colors , hinting of family standards . " For God 's sake , let 's go out on the terrace , away from this fakery , " said Jonathan . Harald laughed without offense . " Everything is fake to Jon , " he said to Robert . " But old Pete brought this entire hall from Germany , so what  | is fake about it ? Nothing ! And the whole castle is furnished in authentic furniture , brought from all over Europe . Sheraton . Chippendale . Spanish . And there 's a lot of Duncan Phyfe , too . Well , let 's go on the terrace . " He had taken Robert 's arm in total friendliness . " Do n't listen to Jon . He tries to sour life for everybody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I 'd love to make it a little sour for you . " " Dear old Jon , " said Harald without resentment . " This door , please , Dr. Morgan . " I-Tr opened a large carved oaken door and a blaze of sunlight struck into the hall . Beyond it was a terrace of smooth gray stones and tubbed exotic flowers , all surrounded by little spruces . The white granite wall of the castle threw a sharp blue shadow on it all , and there was line garden furniture waiting , rustic swings , rockers covered with chintz pillows , sofas in red and blue and yellow . Rattan tables held flowering jars and bowls . The lawns moved smoothly away from the terrace , down to the granite enclosure . The river lay beyond , azure and twinkling , and the farther shore and the mountains gave their own peace and tranquillity to the scene . Somewhere , unseen , a fountain tinkled , and there was a scent of wet stone and luxurious grass blowing over the terrace in a wind as pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blush of shame that he had forgotten it , and sat down . Jonathan sat near him , negligently , his thin legs crossed , his profile to Robert as if he had forgotten him . Harald was superbly gracious . He smiled at Robert amiably . " A drink before lunch ? " he suggested . His eyes were warm and affectionate , as if he had known Robert for many years and considered him a dear friend . " Whiskey and soda , as usual , for me , " said Jonathan , still staring absently at the river . Robert considered . His mother did not believe in strong liquor and he had known , even in college and at medical school and at Johns Hopkins , only beer and wine and sherry . He doubted , in this atmosphere , that any of them would be the proper thing . " Sherry , " said Jonathan , as if reading his mind . Robert hated himself for the heat in his face . " No , " he said . " Thanks , just the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Good , " said 1 larald . He struck a bell on the table near his elbow . The intend was abrupt in that peaceful stillness . A moment later an elderly man in a white jacket came to the door . " Three whiskies and soda , Albert , " said Ilarald , in his kind voice . " Please . " The old man smiled at him like a father . " Surely , Mr. Ferrier , " he said . " At once . " " And would you mind , Albert , asking Miss Heger to join us here ? Yon could bring the sherry for her , too . " " Whiskey , " said Jonathan , still not turning his head .  | " Oh , come now , Jon ! Do n't be disagreeable . Jenny does n't drink whiskey ! She 's a lady . " Jonathan yawned . " She usually drinks whiskey , too . Do n't put on for Bob . " Harald still smiled . But his eyes looked pained and Robert was sorry for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He hesitated . " You 'll be giving Dr. Morgan a bad impression of us here , Jon . " " He 'll get worse , in the town . " Jonathan spoke indifferently . He looked now at Robert . " My mother drinks whiskey , and likes it . And why not ? Such stupidity , thinking women are better , or worse , than men . " Robert did not know what to say . He wished that Jonathan were less intolerable . But Harald was saying with enthusiasm , " Hambledon is a splendid town , really ! You 'll enjoy it , Doctor . Nothing like Philadelphia , of course , but nicer in many ways ? " " Why , then , are you always scheming with lawyers to leave it ? " asked Jonathan . Harald immediately became serious . He leaned earnestly toward his brother . " Now , Jon . You know that 's not true . Is n't Hambledon my home ? Did n't I always return to it when ? " " Papa 's money began to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harald laughed lightly . " Oh , come on , Jon ! This is Dr. Morgan 's first visit here and ? " " We must n't give him a bad impression . Yes , I know . But do you expect he 'll never hear about us in the town ? There 're hundreds of old biddies of both sexes who 'll be only too anxious to tell him all about the Ferriers . Better if he hears it at firsthand . " " You make us sound disreputable , or something . " " And that 's what we are . " Harald was silent . He continued to smile , however . The door opened and jenny came out upon the terrace . She had removed her brown apron , but her blue cotton dress was stained here and there , carelessly , with earth , as if she had come fresh from the garden . Her expression was sullen and remote . She did not look at any of the men , and did not acknowledge them when they rose and greeted her . She moved quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant chair , sat down , turned her face away , and folded her large white hands in her lap . Robert looked at her profile , furtively . Close at hand as she was , she appeared almost incredibly beautiful , her brow and fine nose and white chin thrown into relief by the vivid water , her black hair tumbling in the manner of a schoolgirl about her long pale neck and rigid shoulders , and then dropping down her straight back . She had a remarkably sweet breast , high and firm ; her waist was very small ; her hips swelled under  | her dress with grace and smoothness . Robert thought that never had he seen a girl so extraordinarily lovely . He saw the glint of fierce blue between her black lashes , intent , as aware as an animal 's , and as unmoved , but watchful and full of enmity . rt " I 've ordered whiskey and soda for you , Jenny , " said Harald in a very gentle voice , almost pleading . " I 'm glad you can join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heard him . Her sullen expression did not change . Why , she hates him ! thought Robert . Then he had another thought : No , it was Jonathan whom she hated . She had seen him , and Robert , in the grove of trees after all . In that unpolluted air a good eyc could detect anybody across even a mile of water . Robert became uncomfortable . As he stared at the girl like a boy he felt his nape tingle and the hacks of his broad pink hands . His eye dropped to her bare throat ; light lay in its hollow like a tiny pool of quivering water . The tingling increased in his flesh , and he did not know what it was . Ills eyes dropped even farther to her breast and could not turn away . He did not know that Jonathan was watching him with amusement . He was now staring at Jenny 's round white arms , bare from the strong elbows . Albert returned with a silver tray , a bottle of soda water , and a bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drinks , as if he fascinated them . The silent girl , apparently , was disturbing their peace of mind , though she did not even look at them . Albert took a glass to her and she accepted it in silence , not turning her head . " Cheers , " said Harald , nodding amiably at Robert . " And good health to you , Doctor , and may you be with us a very long time . " " Thank you , " said Robert . He paused . " And please call me Bob . " He smiled like a shy youth . " No one does , in Philadelphia . I 'd like to start it , in Hambledon . " " Do n't encourage it with patients , " said Jonathan . " If you insist on getting very friendly with them , which is not the best thing in the world , let them call you Robert  --  after a long time of probation . " " You must n't listen to Jon , " said Harald , with indulgence . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conventional frock coat and striped trousers . " He became serious . " Everybody will miss him here . But ? tinder the circumstances  --  I think it is wise to leave ? " Jonathan took a long drink at his glass . " And you 'll like it better , t Mr , , , " Now , Jon . Why should I ? " Jonathan held the glass halfway to his lips and looked at his brother . But he said nothing . IIarald was at ease again . However , Robert , who was usually not aware of what his mother called " currents , " felt that  | something dark and inimical had moved onto the terrace and now stood between the brothers . Jonathan 's stare at Harald was cold . Harald seemed not to notice it . He was sipping at his glass contentedly . Robert was drinking also . He had tasted whiskey but once before in his life , as a child , when he had a bellyache and his father had mixed a concoction of honey , whiskey and hot water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not like it today . His ears were beginning to ring a little , though the sensation was quite agreeable . He was still vaguely disturbed at the sudden tension that had lurched into the atmosphere . Then he saw that Jenny was looking at him , with the lack of interest of a statue . Her eyes stared into his , clouded and aloof , much more blue than the river and much more still . Only the small trembling light in the hollow of her throat was alive . Yet Robert knew that she was studying him with hard thoroughness . He suddenly wanted her to like him , to know him as harmless . He swallowed , made himself speak through a tight throat . " Do you like gardening , Miss Heger ? " It was as if she either had not heard him or had no intention of replying to him . Then she shrugged and said in a dull tone , " I just work in my father 's rose gardens . He planted them , himself . But he never lived to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor the indifference in her voice . " Sad , " said Jonathan . Robert 's full mouth tightened . Did he have to mock everything so meanly , even a girl 's natural grief for her dead father ? Jenny still looked only at Robert . " Sad , " she repeated . " He never even saw the house completed . He never lived a single day here . " She spoke without emotion . But the light in the hollow of her throat quickened . Harald said , " Jenny was only a little girl when her father died . They were very fond of each other . Then Myrtle , Jenny 's mother , and Jenny , came to live here . It 's a happy place . " " A very happy place , " said Jonathan . " Felicity . Charm . Sweetness . Enchantment . " He put his glass down with a thump . " And sentimental . " " Do n't be insulting , Jon , " said Harald , with mildness . " We like it , Jenny and I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him that he did n't live ? " " But fortunate for you , " said Jonathan . Robert wished , all at once , that he had not accepted the invitation . His discomfort was acute . Then he saw that Jenny , for the first time , had turned her face to Jon . It had changed . Hatred . was there , more fierce and relentless than ever , but something else was there too , which was secret and violent . Was it despair ? Robert had never been famous  | for his imagination . He had always accepted things at their face value , never looking beneath the obvious for any ulterior meanp ing . It had never occurred to him so to look . But now he was fascinated by the girl 's expression . She had become even paler than before , as if in great pain . Her fingers were clenched on her glass , and the tips had whitened with pressure . Jonathan was indolently studying the water again , as if forgetting everyone on the terrace . Harald said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bob . lie 's always making them . There 's nothing personal in them , I assure you . " " Always personal , " said Jonathan . " Come off it , Harald . I 'm a gentleman . I never insult anyone except intentionally . " Swine , thought I larald , still determinedly smiling . He was all serenity and indulgence . I le said , " How 's Mother today ? " " Do you care ? l-Iowever , she 's as well as possible . " Jenny regarded her glass intently . " Has n't she improved ? It 's been a month since I last saw her . I thought she did n't look well . " " I Tract , " said Harald with sympathy to Robert . " Not very serious , but disabling sometimes . That was the trouble with Myrtle , too . She had to take digitalis regularly . " " I 'm sorry , " said Robert , with a feeling of helplessness . Jonathan replied to Jenny . " She is n't very well . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget morbid things , " said Harald , rising . " I hear the lunch bell . Jenny ? " The girl rose swiftly , her head high and stiff , and swept by them into the house . " Bob ? " said Harald , and Robert followed her . She was already disappearing through a wide door which had opened into the hall , and there was startling sunlight in its dimness . The ( lining room was very large , with a high peaked roof of timbers . The walls were covered with rich rose damask , and the same rose color hung at tall thin windows which had a view of the river . *  | opposite . " This room , " said Jonathan , " would make an excellent mortuary . " " Oh , come on , " said Harald . " You 've said that a hundred times . Do you think Jenny likes to hear what you think of her father 's house ? " Jonathan yawned . He looked at the immense buffet , dark with age , and surmounted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Why the hell do n't you turn this damned place over to the town as a museum ? " " It 's Jenny 's home . She might object . " Harald was lightly amused . He does n't like this place , either ! thought Robert , astonished . " Jenny , " said Jonathan , " would you object ? " She did not answer . " Now , Jenny , " said Harald , " be nice and answer your dear Uncle Jon . " The girl still did not answer . Again , Robert wished he had not come . The strange hostility had followed them here . " Do answer your dear Uncle Jon , " said Jonathan . The girl jumped to her feet . There were tears in her eyes . " I 'll have a tray . Li my room , " she said , and before the men could rise she had run out . " See what you 've done . Again , " said Harald , but without animosity . He smiled apologetically at Robert . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two . Jon is always annoying poor Jenny , and baiting her , and she ca n't stand him . You 'd think they 'd control themselves , would n't you ? Especially seeing we have you as a guest . " " Stop being the perfect host , " said Jonathan , not in the least disturbed by Jenny 's wild rush from the dining room . Swine , thought Harald again . He ca n't behave for a minute . I hope to God he gets out soon . He said with serenity to Robert , " I see we have mock turtle soup today , and a nice fresh fish . I hope you enjoy it . Wine ? " The food was wonderfully seasoned and served . Robert usually had a healthy appetite , and he had been hungry . He was no longer hungry ; he had the strongest urge to leave this place , and the company of brothers who so evidently hated each other . He was shocked . He had never seen fraternal hatred before ; he had not really thought it existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was enough for him that it existed , and he was deeply shaken . It was against nature ! " You are n't eating , " said Jonathan , and for the first time Robert heard genuine kindness in that deep voice . Robert looked at him , and was startled and shaken again . It was as if Jonathan were pitying him ! Robert was suddenly and confusedly angry .  | Harald pleasantly insisted on showing Robert part of the house after a lunch which had seemed disastrous to him . " And do n't forget your studio , " Jonathan suggested . " The studio , by all means . " Harald was not perturbed . " What a joker , " he said , with the utmost amiability . He took Robert 's arm . The vast drawing room was in the tower wing , and it had been made oval accordingly . The ceiling was beamed in mahogany , the stone floor covered with Oriental rugs like dimmed jewels , the walls lined in deep wren silk damask in a fleur-de-lys pattern , the casement windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whitish granite , but larger , the background bricks heavily coated with soot . In this heavy grandeur the French furniture appeared frivolous : small gilt chairs , little gilt and velvet settees , round marble tables with gilt legs , sofas in bright blue damask and satin , crystal-and-gold lamps , pedestals holding Dresden china figurines of shepherds and shepherdesses in pastel colors , old paintings of eighteenth-century wigged gentlemen and pre-French Revolution ladies with white hair and bared bosoms , ornate and massive mirrors , the frames in intricate gilt design , little buhl cabinets filled with objets d'art , and footstools in tapestry and velvet . Apparently some designer had wished to lighten the weight of the room , but even Robert , who knew nothing of balance and proportion and suitability , felt the furniture made the room absurd . He could not explain why . He looked at the windows and again saw the blue of the water , the opposite shore and the purpling mountains . " Silly , is n't it ? " asked Jonathan . Harald only smiled . Robert said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckled . Robert again had the impression that both brothers were laughing together this time , and this made him fed uneasy . " Now , what would you have on this island instead ? " Harald asked his brother with good humor . " I 've told you before . A sturdy large farmhouse of fieldstone , or , at the most pretentious , a Georgian house . Poor old Pete , and his delusions of grandeur ! A peasant dreaming of a palace . " " T'hree 's nothing wrong with dreams , " said Harald . " How can a man live without a dream of something greater than himself ? " " You manage fine . You always did , " said Jonathan . " You'er so subtle , " replied I larald . " I do n't think you , yourself , know whit yon'rr saying most of the time . "  | There was the breakfast room , round and cheerful , with Amish furniture in birch and maple , which Robert liked at once , and the morning room , as Harald called it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright chintz , and the library , thin , narrow , long and gloomy , lined with books which obviously no one ever read , and whose leather covers had been chosen only for their color value . The leather furniture in black , dark blue and crimson , was ponderous and forbidding , and there was a dank and leathery smell here , as of disuse . Great dull portraits were hung on what wall space remained , bearded Victorian gentlemen and prim ladies . " Old Pete 's illustrious ancestors , " said Jonathan . " Do n't gibe , " said Harald . " If Pete invented ancestors it did them no harm , nor him , either . He would n't be the first , in America . " Robert was very weary not only of the castle , which did not seem to him to be as charming as at first ; but of the wrangling brothers . There was an undertone in their objective insults which vaguely alarmed him , for though the overtone was light the one below was vicious . Harald , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Robert thought . It was Jonathan who was the most offensive , determined to be insulting and even crude . It 's strange , thought Robert , I never considered him to be deliberately obnoxious and uncouth and cruel , before . That poor girl ! If he does , indeed , despise her as he admitted to me , ordinary good manners should have kept him from baiting her . " Now the studio ! " said Jonathan , in a voice ringing with false enthusiasm . " The heart of the castle , the real reason for its being ! " " Oh , shut up , " said Harald , smiling broadly . " Bob would n't he interested in my daubs . " But Robert , who was liking him more and more in contrast to Jonathan , whom he was liking less and less , said , " I do n't know much about art ? " " But you know what you like , " said Jonathan with a straight face . Robert flushed . Harald took his arm again , as if in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you must n't listen to him . Just a rough , unpolished diamond , our dear Jon . Do you really want to see my studio ? It 's on the second floor with a good north light . " He led the way up the dark and uncarpeted oaken staircase with its somber window of stained glass . Here the dankness of the air appeared concentrated and Robert was conscious of an odd feeling of oppression again . The narrow hall above was lined with heavy oaken doors , carved and cold , and the floor was covered with a narrow Oriental runner . Harald opened one door on a chill and sunless northern light , and they entered a large and bare room , the wooden walls stacked with canvases , the curtainless big window looking out on a river which appeared too cool , too broad , and empty . Some of the paintings were al-  | ready hung on the walls ; one large canvas was on an easel . The room smelled of paint and turpentine and wood and dust , and brackish water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished painting was like anything he had remotely seen before , for none contained anything recognizable . There were whirling whorls of violent color , splashes of red with magenta and blue , black lines in geometric designs , twisting spirals in opposed hues , flat lengths of color that led to no conclusions . He was bewildered . " Look at this , " said Jonathan , drawing his attention to the wildest hung canvas of them all . Robert dubiously approached . There was something like a scarlet sun burning in the very center , but the rays and crooked lines and whirls were violet , green , purple , pink , blue , black , yellow , and every shade in-between . On the left-hand upper corner there was a splotch of enameled white dotted with staring black . " Magnificent , is n't it ? " asked Jonathan , with an air of tremendous admiration . " I 'm not familiar with art , in this form , " said Robert , trying to find some meaning in this furious and incoherent mass . " Just New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're provincial , " said Jonathan . " Now , I 'll tell you what this is . It 's Harald 's impression of the war , in which he was n't engaged , he being in Paris at the time , while I was sweltering away in those damned Cuban jungles and getting malaria . " " It does look like a jungle , " said Robert , who had never seen a jungle . " It is n't a jungle , " said Harald , without annoyance . " Jon 's at it again . It 's my impression of American towns . " Surely he was joking , thought Robert . Then he saw that Harald was n't joking at all . " My impression of undercurrents , " said Harald , " which imply vehemence and vindictiveness , bursts of witless energy , a stagnant sun which rises and falls on nothing , really , half-concealed animosities and prejudices , dirty little sins , avidity without an object  --  in short , almost any small American city . " " You do , " said Jonathan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critically , " give an impression of stench . Do n't you think so , Bob ? " " I thought you liked Ilamblcdon , " said poor Robert to Harald . " Oh , I do , I really do . But that does n't prevent me from seeing it clear and seeing it whole . " " Oh , " said Robert . Jonathan burst out laughing . " I won a prize for this , in New York , " said Harald , without animosity . " I was Ducted live hundred dollars for it , but I like it too much to part with it . " 1 Ic pointed to a red ribbon at the foot of the canvas . " I 'm  | proud of it . " He smiled in Jonathan 's direction . " Of course , provincials do n't understand , but this is the coming art-form . You 'll see . " " I should n't wonder , " said Jonathan . " This surely will be the age of the uneducated and mentally illite te , and artists without art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even how to draw . It 'll be the age when the color-blind will be doing most of the painting . " " Art must shock , not soothe , " said Harald , still good-tempered . " We 've passed the age of complacency . And unthinking engagements in directionless activity . " Robert was now convinced that the antagonism between the brothers lay in the fact that Jonathan had served in the recent war but that Harald had deftly evaded it . He , himself , had wished to serve with Teddy Roosevelt 's Rough Riders , but his mother had hysterically objected and his teachers had earnestly assured him that his profession was even more important than patriotism . " The Republican Party , " said Harald , leading the way down the dark staircase , " is too radical for me , too expansionist . I am working on an impression of it . I prefer the Democratic , which is conservative and which despises imperialism . " " But you also love William Jennings Bryan , " said Jonathan . " A man of color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert did not care for Mr. Bryan . At the bottom of the staircase he said with apology , " All our friends in Philadelphia are Republicans . They seem like sober citizens to me , Harald . " " Sorry , dear boy . They are full of what they call dynamic enthusiasm , which is only exploitation . Look what they did after the Civil War : Indiscreetly set loose a horde of ex-slaves on the population . Radicals . Vulgarians . People without conservative standards , lacking an awareness of the historical imperative . " " He has n't the slightest damned idea of what he 's talking about , " said Jonathan . " He does n't even know who first talked about the historical imperative . ' Karl Marx said it , in Das Kapital . But Marx , as Harald does n't seem to know , was the worst conservative of them all , and a true hater of what he called the masses . ' City people ! As Socrates said , the most malign enemies of the people are born and bred in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the earth the more dangerous you become . " " You 'd say that , being a farmer , " said Harald , in a tone of understanding affection . They went out into the hot sunshine , and Robert felt relieved . He feared complexities and smothered hostilities , and he had no idea of what the brothers meant . He had come here , from Philadelphia and Johns Hopkins , believing  | that he would encounter , in Hambledon , the utmost simplicity , the heart of uninvolved America . But the conversation he had heard between these brothers had alarmed him . Small towns were not , as he thought , simple places filled with good hearts and uncomplex emotions , and bright with honest good will . His mother had said , condescendingly , " There may be advantages in Hambledon . Fresh air , fresh places , plainness , homeliness . Natural , guileless . You can be a Great Influence , my darling , in bringing urban values  --  in controlled measure  --  to the unaffected natives . " What an ass his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct his guests down to the river and the boat , but Jonathan said , " What ? In those patent-leather shoes of yours ? Do n't soil them , pray . " So I l.trald said his goodbyes at the door of the castle , waved his hand with fondness at Robert , and went inside . " Amiable rascal , is n't he ? " asked Jonathan , as he and Robert strolled down the brick path between the lawns . " 1 t h i n k he 's very kind , " said Robert with some stiffness . ' ' l lc is , he is . That he is , " said Jonathan . " ' Smile and smile , and be a villain . ' " Robert had encountered no one who was less a villain than Harald , so he said nothing in reply to this malicious remark . They came upon Jenny , who had put on her brown apron again . She was busy cultivating a rose bed , her rough blue dress hanging over her upturned heels . Jonathan strolled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his presence . Her hands were brown with warm earth , her knees sunken in soil . " The roses are very beautiful , " said Robert . She turned her head slightly , a trowel in her hand . " Thank you , " she said sullenly . Her white forehead was wet with sweat , and her full lips were very red . Her loose hair was in a rich tangle down her back . " I 've enjoyed visiting you , " Robert went on . Now she frankly stared at " VVhy ? " " Well . Everything is so charming . " She seemed to muse on his redI I I ntustliChe. " b. it ) " she asked , with abruptness , and went hack to her cultivating . J n.uh.ut itnl , aticntly whistled to him and Robert started .

Then he saw that jenny 's hands had , tggpr.I the it vigorous movements and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of despair , or something else , that Robert had noticed I , . too I ) o.turhrd again , Robert went on and joined Jonathan . Itny w:u very strange here , he concluded . He did not like it .  | They rowed in silence across the river . Robert was conscious all the time of Jonathan 's harsh study of him . Finally Robert said , " I knew we would n't be welcome . " He was resentful . " Of course we were welcome . Harald loves company . He loves everybody . He says so , himself . " " There 's nothing wrong with liking people , " said Robert , pulling strongly on the oars . " I never did . " " Then , how could you become a physician and a surgeon ? " Jonathan laughed . " I can still feel pity . Sometimes . " He stood up in the rocking boat . " Here . Let me take the oars for the last length . " When they reached the shore Jonathan released his horses , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of birches . " Why do n't you join my mother and me for tea , Bob ? " The sun was already dropping to the west , and the heat was intense . The river was now pure bright gold . " Thank you , but no , " said Robert . " I  --  I have a lot of things to do . Before I joined you today I had a telegram from my mother . She is coming here four days earlier . I  --  I have arrangements to make . She wants a suite in the hotel . " Jonathan 's black brows drew down over his dark eyes . He shrugged . " Very well . Another day . My mother likes you , Bob . " Do you ? thought Robert . He got in the phaeton with Jonathan and they drove off briskly . Jenny Heger continued to cultivate her father 's roses after the guests had left . But now there were tears on her cheeks , which she childishly wiped away with the back of her hands , leaving smudges on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulders , and then fingers moving softly through the hot tangle of her black hair . She did not lift her head . She said , " I warned you not to touch me . One of these days you 'll make me kill you . " " Sweet Jenny , " said Harald . " You 're like a young , unbroken colt . " " Take your hands away from me ! " Harald stood up , sighing . " I love you , Jenny . I want to marry you . What 's so offensive about that ? " " I will really kill you , " said Jenny . She sat back on her heels and regarded him with hatred , her blue eyes one savage blaze . " I will surely kill you , " she repeated . She looked at him with all the power of her strong young body and spirit , and after a moment he strolled off .  | The warm June weather had suddenly disappeared . Now the sky was gray and misty and the air chill and clamp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dripped from trees and shrubbery and eaves , though it was not raining . Jonathan Ferrier and his mother , Marjorie Ferrier , sat in the breakfast noon of their sturdy red brick house with the white shutters and doors and trimmings of brass , brightly shined . The casement windows were shut tightly , the blue draperies partly drawn , the gas chandelier lit in this early morning , and a brisk little fire rustling on the white brick hearth . It was pleasant here and fragrant with potpourri and wax and coffee and burning wood , the room octagonal in shape , the walls palely painted , the furniture of light mahogany . Marjorie Ferrier , fifty-five years old , was tall and slender , having retained her girlhood figure and grace . She wore a well-fitting shirtwaist of white lawn and lace , the high neck boned , and a slim , long black skirt of soft silk . Her tall pompadour was black , with ribbons of gray through it , and there were small pearls at her ears . In appearance , she greatly resembled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face thin and planed , her mouth austere , her nose sharp and somewhat long , her black brows straight . But her eyes were brilliantly hazel , and large , like her son , Harald 's , with thick short lashes . It was from his mother , the former Miss Farmington , that Jonathan had inherited his " foreign " look , and not from his father who was of French descent . Harald resembled his father , who had been more Anglo-Saxon in appearance than his truly Anglo-Saxon wife . Mrs. Ferrier was a handsome woman , elegant and restrained , and only the faint pallor about her lips suggested that she was not in the best of health . She never spoke of illness or disability , for she was a lady . She rarely descended to the personal , for she was a woman of reticences . Neither of her sons knew her well at all , and Jonathan the Mast , It was her nature to preserve her privacy even from her children , and though she had never punished them , herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a stern glance to quell them . In many ways they ( eared her . They did not know that she loved them dearly . It was one of her aphorisms that a man was truly the head of the household . Since her husband 's death Jonathan had become that head . Gentlemen frequently read their newspapers or periodicals at the breakfast table , M- she was not offended that Jonathan was reading . She was  | content to fill his coffee cup from her polished silver coffeepot , to touch the bell under her chair with her foot to summon fresh hot toast . " Hah ! " exclaimed Jonathan . " Here 's our nice fat Mr. Taft calling the Filipinos our little brown brothers ! ' That should make them happy , considering they have proud Spanish blood in them ! " He chuckled . " And here 's a parody of that , by an anonymous American soldier : He may be a brother of Big Bill Taft  --  but he ai n't no brother of mine ! ' What nauseating condescensions politicians can spout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of troubles going on , " said Marjorie Ferrier in a mild tone . " Well , the Boer War is over , at any rate . " " Remember what Life said about that war ? A small boy with diamonds is no match for a large burglar with experience . ' " " I never cared for the Boers , " said Marjorie , refilling Jonathan 's cup . " No , I suppose you did n't . You are one of the few admirers of the resounding British Empire . " " Oh , Jon , come ! The British Empire is the balance wheel in the world . Do n't you remember that cartoon in that London newspaper , the Times , I think , last year , of Russia and the United States jointly seizing a globe of the world , with Britain reduced to a tiny figurine beneath it ? Oh , dear , I hope not ! Not so long as Britain is strong , at any rate . " Her voice had Jonathan 's deep timbre , but was lighter and gentler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloomily . " There was an earlier cartoon ; I saw a reproduction of it . First published in the New York Herald , I think , 1857 . Thomas Nast ? Wonderful cartoonist . He depicted , then , forty-four years ago , that old bearded Ivan and America would one day be struggling to divide the world between them . " " Absurd , " said Marjorie . She rang for more hot toast . " Why should America have imperialistic ambitions ? Absurd . And that barbarous Russia , with her Czars , has enough trouble subduing her own people and keeping them from revolt . She is a very mysterious Oriental nation , is n't she ? Why in the world should America ever come into contact with her , except perhaps in trade , and we do very little of that ? There 's no point of real contact between our country , and Russia . " " You never can tell about the future , " said Jonathan . His mother laughed a little . " We are a big nation , " said Marjorie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . We still have Territories which are not yet States . It will take centuries , really , to fill America from coast to coast . We have quite enough to do without any foreign ambitions or any alliances with any-one ! " " You never can tell , " repeated Jonathan . " What makes you think we  | wo n't have ' ambitions , ' say in twenty-five or fifty years ? If we do n't , , ve 'll be unique in the history of the world , and of mankind . " " We are unique , " said Marjorie , in a tranquil tone . " We had no ambitions , not even in the last war . We 'll be giving Cuba her freedom , goon . , Jonathan thoughtfully sipped at his fresh coffee . " Unique , " he re ) eated . I le shook his head . " No , we 're not . We began as ancient Rome ) egan . We 'll probably end as she did , too , in a bloody despotism , with lic tators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low morbid you are this morning , " said Marjorie . " But then , you were always a solemn little boy , too . " She smiled at him fondly , a smile he did not sec . " ' There 's one thing you can always be certain of , " said Jonathan , ' that it 's vcry unwise not to underestimate the good will of mankind . We have n't honestly taken one step forward to true manhood in five thousand years . We 're the same old murdering bas ? " He stopped . But Marjorie only smiled . " Not America , " she said . " The Spanish-American War was n't really a war in the full sense . We 've been at peace since 1865 , over thirty-five years . We 'll never have the wars Europeans have , thank God . " " Do n't be too sure . We 'll begin to feel our oats . It 's human nature . " " But , we have two large oceans protecting , and isolating us , and again , thank God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Egyptians found that out , and so did Egypt and Palestine , when Rome began to stretch her muscles and look around for new worlds to conquer , and exploit . " Marjorie gave him the jam pot . " Jon , dear , you really are morbid . You have n't any faith in your own country . Did I tell you that Jenny is having tea with me today ? " " Dear , sweet Jenny , " said Jonathan , and made an ugly grimace . " Now , Jon . I do hope I Iarald will bring her . It 's such a nasty ' day , and it 's a long row across the river . " " Darling 1 1. uahl , " said Jonathan . " I Iow 's the scandal running in the town lately ? " Marjorie w.s distressed . " is n't it horrible ? Such evil-minded people . " " Yost ca n't Mimic them , when it conics to our Harald . " Inns I do wish you 'd stop your everlasting sneering at your brother . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was always your pet , was n't he ? " No , thought Marjorie , with deep sadness . She said , " Harald does n't have a very strong character . I thought , when he married , he 'd choose it firm  --  minded girl , who would direct him and guide him . But , he married Myrtle. "  | " For her money . " " Poor Myrtle . We must n't vilify the dead . " " Oh , certainly not . I was n't vilifying Mrytle , Mother . I was vilifying Harald , if that 's possible . A firm-minded girl ' ? Like Jenny , for instance . " His mother looked at him strangely . It seemed incredible to her that Jonathan was so blind , he who was always astute and perceptive . " Jenny , " she said , in her gentlest voice , " is a wonderful girl . I love her dearly . You are so harsh about her . You are quite wrong , and so is the town . " " I know . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where are you going this unpleasant morning , dear ? " " To try to badger that old  --  I mean , old Louis Hedler into accepting Bob Morgan on the staff of St. Hilda 's . " He paused . " I could n't induce you to part with twenty-five thousand dollars , could I , to match my own twenty-five thousand dollars , for a new nurses ' wing ? " Marjorie raised her black brows . " That 's a large bribe , " she remarked . " For a young man you hardly know . " " But you 'll remember that you were considering that  --  a year ago . " He looked at her , and they both remembered indeed that Marjorie and he were going to give that to the expensive private hospital  --  until the trial . " Yes , " said Marjorie . " You 'll let me mention that , then ? They really need that wing , you know . " Marjorie sighed . She played with the handle of the cup . Then she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonathan ? " " Nothing . " She said , " I want you to know this , dear . If you want me , I 'll go with you wherever you go . " " And leave sweet jenny and darling Harald ? Mother ! " The pallor about her mouth increased . It was utterly beyond her training to reach out her hand impulsively , take her son 's , draw him to her and kiss him , and let him know how dear he was to her . So she remained silent . After a moment or two she said , " Very well . I will keep the promise I made . But , is it necessary ? " " Yes . That 's why I brought the matter up . Old Hedler 's too close to Martin Eaton . Even if Eaton is still recovering from his stroke and just learning to walk again . " He 'll never forget , thought Marjorie , and never forgive . He was always a relentless little boy . She said , " How cruel of them . Jonathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his behalf ? " " I think so . I hope so . By the way , his mother 's arriving today . He never told me much about her , but I gather she 's a  --  well  --  let me put  | it this way : a vulgar , pretentious , arch sort of woman . Yet his father was a gentleman . I hope to be able to rescue Bob from her , eventually , and get him married off to the firm-minded character you were referring to . A lady , however . On the other hand , maybe he needs a soft girl to bring out his latent virility . " He bent stiffly and kissed his mother 's forehead , and she gave him a cool kiss on the cheek . She watched him go . There was a pain in her which did not rise from her heart . She thought of Mavis Eaton , Jonathan 's dead young wife , and her pale mouth parted in fresh suffering . She had never liked Mavis , the vital , zesty , tantalizing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , so alive and vivid , so stupid and cuddling and cruel ! How Jonathan had adored her . How strange it was for Jonathan , who was so perceptive , not to have known all about Mavis at once , even when she was a child . But men were peculiar when it came to women . The dullest woman could deceive the most intelligent man . Marjorie had subtly expressed her disapproval to Jonathan a thousand times before the wedding , but had aroused only his anger and indignation . She had attended the wedding , calm , serene , smiling , while she had cried inwardly and with foreboding . She had accepted Mavis into her house , after the honeymoon , and had behaved toward the girl with kindness and affection . It had been no use at all . Marjorie shuddered . She pressed her hands hard over her eyes , leaned her elbows on the table and dropped her face into her hands . She dared not say a word . One word would bring disaster , and it must never be spoken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the diploma-mill hack , " as Jonathan called him . " That 's a magnificent offer , my boy , really magnificent ! So good of you and charming Marjorie . But she was always generous . I knew her in Philadelphia , you know , and her family . " " Yes , I know . Nearly everyone knew my mother in Philadelphia , ' to hear them tell it , " said Jonathan . He could not help it ; he said , " I 'm sorry about your sister-in law , by the way . " Thr soft , fat , elderly face across from liim changed , and the bulging brown eyes pointed in a hard fashion at Jonathan . But Dr. Hedler sighed , and said , " Yes . Too bad . licit there was no way of finding out that she had cancer before the operation . We could only sew her up , and lie to her , " Jonathan had been regretting his remark , a brutal one , but now he knew that he was , in fact , applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ) r , 1 bailer . Good . For Dr. Hedler knew that Jonathan had made the diagnosis of possible carcinoma over a year ago , and had been ignored , and among the more urbanely ridiculing had been Dr. Hedler ,  | himself . Dr. Hedler might be Chief-of-Staff at St. Hilda 's , but everyone was aware of his " medical " background , especially the younger physicians , and everyone , even his enemies , knew that Dr. Ferrier was a famous surgeon and diagnostician , and that his diagnosis had been verified in the operating room . Yes , I 'm a dangerous type , thought Jonathan , with pleasure . They were sitting in the dignified but luxurious Chief-of-Staff 's office , all paneled wood , heavy crimson velvet draperies , burning fire in a black marble fireplace , rich Brussels rug , and handsome pictures and excellent dark mahogany furniture . It had begun to rain , a warm murmurous rain mysteriously full of promise . It ran down the tall windows in silvery rivulets . " I have a feeling about cancer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people out of ten thousand die of it , in one form or another . That 's comparatively few , compared with the other killers , such as diarrhea and tuberculosis . And pneumonia and influenza and diphtheria . These are our present murderers , while cancer is rare in comparison . It wo n't always be that way . Twenty years ago one person in ten thousand died of it . In forty , or fifty years ? As we conquer one disease another takes its place . Balance of nature . But cancer is the foulest disease of all . " " It will always be rare , " said Dr. Hedler , with the indulgence of the experienced toward the more youthful and inexperienced . " And it only affects the very old in most cases , though Georgia is n't old , I admit . However , she is n't very young , either . Do you know that she 's only the tenth case I have seen in all my long years of practice ? " I would n't doubt it for a moment , thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " I 've heard of only one case of leukemia , " said Dr. Hedler . " I 've had about eight , " said Jonathan . " I think that form of cancer is increasing , too . " Dr. Hedler smiled and shook his head . " I doubt it . Well . Let us look again at young Dr. Morgan 's credentials . Um . " He put on his pince-nez . " Interned at Johns Hopkins . That 's very nice . " He sighed with a sound of soft suet moving . " I did take it up before with Martin Eaton , you know . " " And he turned down his thumb . " Dr. Hedler was pained . " Jon , he 's a very reasonable man , and he did found St. Hilda 's , and it 's his pride and joy . Gave a quarter of a million dollars  --  a huge sum ! I showed him Dr. Morgan 's credentials . He , er , said the staff is filled . " " Closed staff . Curse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We need all the physicians , and surgeons , we can get for Hambledon and the surrounding territory . Keep the newcomers out and off the staff , and  | we wo n't be able to meet the demand . And the hospitals we have will deteriorate . " " We have to protect the income of the staff , Jon . " " Protect the staff 's income . Let the public be damned . Who said that ? Was it old J. P. Morgan , or one of the Vanderbilts ? It does n't matter . The public deserves better treatment from its doctors and its hospitals . What 're we here for , anyway ? " " We ca n't let the new young doctors enthusiastically fill up all our beds ! They love that . Gives them a reputation . What of the people who really need beds ? " " We can always intrude our own judgment , if a boy gets too ambitious , " said Jonathan . " Now , old Martin . He 's acting out of spite , and you know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff will go along with you , if you say so and give Bob Morgan your approval . Old Martin 's been domineering you for years ; we all know that . Show your independence . " I ) r . ! Wier turned ( lark red , but he controlled his fury . " One of these ( lays , my boy , your tongue will hang you . " He stopped abruptly . But Jonathan only grinned . " It almost did , once , " he said . " We 're getting off the subject . Hambledon 's growing ; so is the whole territory around here . Industry moving in . The medical population has to grow , too , to keep up . Keep denying young doctors a place on the hospital staffs and they 'll have to go somewhere else , and Hambledon 's the loser . We 're lucky to have a fellow like Bob Morgan applying . Let 's get some fresh air in this town . " He waited . Dr. Hedler did not speak . " Come on , Louis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never be able to practice again , and you know it . If you go over his head , and you have the right to , as Chief-of-Staff , there 'll be some indignant growling , and then it will be forgotten . Besides , I 'm leaving , as you know damned well . Who are you privately considering to replace me ? " Before he could stop himself Dr. Hedler said , " Martin has someone in mind . He will finish his internship in December . " " What hospital ? " lint I ) r . Hedler merely shook his head . He looked again at the credentials . Jon said , " Fifty thousand dollars . Where are you going to yet that much so soon ? Off the street ? " I ) r . I killer silently stared clown at the credentials . " Look here , " said Jonathan , " take Bob Morgan . Or I 'll stay here on the staff and where will Martin 's precious protege he then ? I 'll tell you something : If I stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not that that would n't 1w a good idea in the long run , or maybe even the short run . You 'll be doing him a real favor , Louis , if you take my choice . "  | " When you put it that way ? Yes , I can see what you mean . Give me another opportunity to talk with him , Jon . And , as you said , fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money , and we need the nurses ' wing practically at once . " Dr. Hedler became genial . " Let me thank you , Jon . And Marjorie . " So , it 's all right , thought Jon . Blackmail , bribe , a chance for revenge . Who can resist all these ? Not old Louis ! " No , no , no flowers , " said Robert Morgan to the hotel manager who had just brought in a mighty vase of highly scented field roses , as red as blood and furious with life . " My mother is sensitive to all flowers . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roses . They reminded him of Jenny Heger . He added , " I 'd like them in my own room , though . " He would never see roses again without thinking of Jenny . The very thought of her was poignant to him . He was in the best suite the modest hotel could offer . His mother would be pleased . It had a large sitting and dressing room , all clean , fresh , if undistinguished furniture , brown velvet draperies , red Turkey rug , polished windows . He peeped into the bedroom , and saw the big brass bed with its brown velvet counterpane and bolster , its good decorated china and sturdy commode , its thick towels and fine linen handtowels . Not splendid , but more than adequate . " We 'll be happy to welcome Mrs. Morgan , Doctor , " said the hotel manager . " Tell her , in my name , that the hotel services are hers to command . " And she 'll certainly command them , thought Robert , and was at once ashamed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Not yet . But I have four in mind , and when my mother comes we 'll choose among them . " " We 'll be sorry to lose you , Doctor . " The door closed after the manager . Robert returned to his own room . It seemed uncommonly small and bare to him , in the dull dusk of the rainy day . He looked at his watch . His mother would arrive at the station in one hour . He must look for a hack at once ; they had a way of being invisible when it rained . He put on his hat  --  and his gloves  --  and ran lightly to the elevator . He had remembered to put his white silk handkerchief in his breast pocket , and to wear the infernal frock coat and striped trousers which his mother felt to be the only uniform for a doctor . He even took his cane with him . He looked at himself in the elevator mirror as he went creakingly down . He had trimmed his mustache very closely this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have preferred him with a full red beard . Proper beard for a doctor .  | Only an hour ago Jonathan Ferrier had had him called to the hotel telephone to tell him that he was practically certain that he , Bob Morgan , would be named to the staff of St. Hilda 's . And , very soon , to the staff of the Friends ' Hospital . " A matter of a few days , " ' said Jonathan . " I thought you should know . " " It 's very kind of you , " said Robert . You do n't know hots damned and expensively kind it was ! thought Jonathan , a little annoyed that the young doctor should take it all so casually . He said , " You 're very lucky . " Robert was puzzled . He said , " Well , I was always told I was born under a lucky star ! Hello ? " But Jonathan had hung up the receiver . Robert stared at the telephone . These small towns ! Central was always disconnecting people . Ile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elevator . It had never occurred to him that he would not be accepted on the staff of the hospitals . It slid not occur to him now . Had Jonathan had another hut unsaid reason to call him ? What ? Robert had found himself thinking of Jenny Heger again . It was odd that she came into his mind so regularly and that he could see her beautiful face so clearly , and her amazing blue eyes , and the way she moved , and her tumble of black and curling hair . It was unpardonable of Jon Ferrier to bait her so cruelly and despise her so openly . Robert forgot all the gossip he had heard in Hambledon about Jenny and Harald Ferrier . He could only resent Jonathan . Jonathan spent the dingy cool afternoon in his offices , in the long preparation for his departure from Hambledon forever . His mother had built the premises for him as a gift when he had set up practice ten years ago . Like the house where he had been born , and his father and grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white and brass trimmings , a single-story structure nearly three acres from the house , with a dark slate roof . It was not that Marjorie overly disliked the thought of her son having his offices in the large house where they lived , for now there were but two in the family , with two servants and there were many rooms which could have been utilized . But she knew that Jonathan was a " private " person like herself , resenting propin ( luity which they both considered vulgar and not dignified and a little nonhuman . " The precious thing which distinguishes man from the lower animals , " she would say , " is his love for privacy , for alone-ness , his liking for occasional solitude away from his bellowing fellows . It is bestial to huddle , to peer into each other 's pots , to mind another 's business , to interfere ' lovingly ' in his life . " She had also thought , with distaste and revulsion , of the invasion of her house by troops of patients , even if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gratification , she had  | built this suite of offices which faced the blank wall of the distant house . There was also a white picket fence between , with a gate that was usually locked . The grounds were beautifully landscaped , however , with softly rolling lawns and shrubs and flower beds and old trees . But many of the older doctors were astonished , for it was still the custom to have one 's offices attached to one 's residence . Only the poorer , and younger , doctors were establishing offices in public buildings and even over shops . When they would become more affluent they would buy houses and have their offices there . Jonathan 's offices consisted of a small but well-appointed pharmacy , where he concocted his own remedies and improved on those already available , a comfortable waiting room , a consultation room finely paneled and furnished and with a gas log fire , a small office for his bookkeepertypist ( the spinster and " advanced " daughter of a minister ) , a file room , and two examination roms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though she disliked it for her own house , considering it too stark . There was a telephone directly connected with the house , and a public one . The walls of Jonathan 's consultation room were mostly lined with his medical books , and with cabinets for medical journals . It was a handsome room , warm and large and quiet . Here he had spent the eight happiest years of his life . Here he sat today , at his great walnut desk , another gift of his mother , going through the drawers and slowly emptying them . All at once , he was tremendously depressed . He got up and strolled through the suite , restlessly . The minister 's daughter was no longer there ; he had discharged her several months ago , for he now rarely practiced and accepted few patients . Everything was silent except for the dripping of the rain and gusts of late spring winds , and the small hiss of the gas fires . The suite already felt deserted and abandoned . Jon paused in the waiting room , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a bright overhead electric chandelier of tasteful proportions . His patients would not gather here any longer ; they would be young Bob 's patients very shortly . He went into the room where his bookkeeper had sat ; the typewriter was covered , the little desk and chair empty . The lady would return , she had promised , under " the new doctor . " He slowly entered the pharmacy , and saw his jars and bottles and boxes of pills and powders and liquid , all bright and shining under the light , and also waiting . Then he went into the examination rooms , so well-equipped with modern tables and white chairs and cabinets full of his precious instruments for minor operations and inspections . At last he stood in the short hall with the doors and the silence about him . He stood there a long time , thinking . He still had to go  | over the files of his patients , with special notations for young Bob . The files of people 's lives , with all their ailments and their histories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into the file room and stared at the rank of green steel files , discreetly locked so that no one had access to them except himself . A man 's life was his own . Was it ? In less than a few months his , Jonathan 's , was no longer his own . It belonged to no one at all , even himself . He was already an exile . Very shortly , this beloved place would he rented by another and he would be forgotten . He would be  --  where ? He shrugged . He did not know . His mother was not aware that he had been considering never practicing again , but going abroad to live in quiet and solitude , perhaps in Cornwall , perhaps in Chartres , perhaps in serried and lonely Spain , perhaps in Berlin . There was no place for him in the world he had known ; he was not only exiled , lout he was self-exiled . He had never had an enormous affection for his fellowman , for he felt that overt affection was an insult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " warmth , " which was something you extended only to a beloved dog or cat , or , in private , to a wife or a husband or a dear child . But he had compassion for all that lived , especially infants , young mothers and the fearful old . Pain and suffering had been abhorrent to him . He found nothing " noble " in agony , nothing to be offered up for the sake of others , nothing in the way of " reparation , " as the clergy said . ( On this , too , he had parted company with the Church . ) To him pain was an insult to humanity ; it should not be countenanced ; it was a waste of time , which could be employed in the stern business of being a man . True , pain was inseparable from living , but it should be pain and striving of the spirit , as man struggled toward manhood . Physical pain reduced man to an animal , and Jonathan had fought such pain with grim intensity and disgust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneered at him as the " pill-roller . " They had considered a certain amount of pain as " salubrious , " or a promoter of " humility , " though they were careful not to permit a great deal in their own lives or in the lives of members of the family . They distrusted even the new Aspirin , and were annoyed that it could he knight without prescription . But Jon gave it out in full loxes , for a pittance . " What 's heroic about a toothache or the pains of ncctntatism " he would say . " Those hypocrites ! They do n't mind swallowing morphine at the slightest ache they have , themselves ! " He knew that many physicians were already addicted , and he was outraged that they were permitted in operating rooms . He was working with the American Medical Association on the dangers of drug-addiction , though many of his colleagues still angrily insisted that morphine was " harmless . "  | A young priest had said to him , " Pain is God 's punishment on our fallen race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And you do n't believe in a whiff of ether or chloroform for a woman in childbirth , to relieve her insufferable pangs ? Did you ever see a difficult birth , Father ? Or a britch-presentation ? Now , honestly , would you advise operations without anesthetics ? " " Well , no , Jon . Of course I would n't . Do you think I 'm a Fundamentalist screecher ? But woman was condemned to suffer in labor ? " " Maybe ordinary labor . I do n't believe in much interference then , except during the last ten minutes or so ; it could be dangerous to both mother and child . If you carry your thought on logically , doctors would be outlawed , as they were for the first few hundred years of Christianity , or regarded with contempt as mere vets , and sacrilegious , in the Middle Ages . Even in Britain , to this day a doctor is a mere Mister . ' When Our Lord cured the suffering He did say , Your sins are forgiven you . ' But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surely you know that ? We do n't believe , any longer , that his sin ' is the cause of a child being born crippled or blind or defective or diseased . Or cancer a judgment ' on the anguished , many of them good people who had rarely sinned in their lives . Remember how , in medieval times , a man or even a child who became sick was regarded as a criminal , suffering the condemnation of a supposedly merciful God ? Sometimes he was stoned to death . Yes ! You know that , Father . What an offense to God that must have been ! " " Yes , Jon , I know . But your ferocious war on pain  --  which is exemplary  --  does seem a personal battle to you , a personal insult ? " " That 's because I believe in the dignity of man . " He no longer believed in it . He no longer cared what happened to his fellows , because of what they had inflicted on him , because of the derision and hatred even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it had all come from only a few who had not known him at all , even by reputation , he could have forgiven . But it had come from his friends and his own patients , who had eagerly desired  --  yes , they had desired ! ? to believe the very worst of him . Many still so desired ; many were still disappointed . I was puerile , he thought , staring at the files with rage and bitterness . I expected that some men at least were human . I expected that some had a sense of justice . I actually believed in friendship ! What an utter , stupid , disgusting fool I was ! No man has a friend . We hate each other instinctively ; we love to destroy each other . What other explanation is there for wars , for all the obscene injustice we administer to each other , in full and radiant malice ? Nothing delights a man more than causing pain to his brother . Even a rat has better instincts toward his kind .  | When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he despised himself . He had vowed , months ago , that never would he lift a hand to help another again . He thought of young Dr. Morgan . Now , why in hell had he bribed and blackmailed to get him appointed to the staffs of those hospitals ? Jonathan struck the files angrily with the palm of his hand , in revulsion against himself . He thought of the pain recorded there , and the hopeless hope and despair , and he said aloud , " Good . " He had cut his palm a little on the steel and he looked at the drops of blood with anger . The young priest had said , " You must not desert humanity , Jon . " He had replied , " But humanity first deserted me . I do n't care about their pain any longer , Father . " " That is a sin against God . He made you a physician . " " That 's why I 'm resigning ! " He had grinned . But he was resigning because he had lost his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected all priests that way , Jon , after listening in Confessionals , there would be no clergy . " " I am no priest , Father . " " All physicians , the real ones , are priests , Jon . Once only priests were physicians . You remember that ? " But Jon had not replied . He had left one of the few men who had believed in him . He was thinking of this now . He felt anger against young Father McNulty , to whom life was very simple . Father McNulty " loved " people . Oh , for God 's sake ! What was there to " love " ? Suddenly he thought of Jenny Heger , the trollop . He turned and went into his office again and sat down at his desk . Aimlessly , he began to clear out the drawers . He found the small framed photograph of his dead young wife , Mavis . He set it on his desk and stared at the lovely face , framed in its masses of fair hair , at the full soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merry eyes , the gentle , sloping shoulders . Eagerness for life shone from the low wide brow , the dimpled chin , the delicate shadow under it . Mavis . Beautiful , laughing Mavis , with the womanly breast , the tiny waist , the swelling hips , the rounded arms and thighs ! He took the photograph carefully from the frame and tore it to bits and threw the fragments into his wastebasket . After a moment , he dropped the frame into it , also . " I 'm glad you 're dead , Mavis , " he said . " I often wanted to kill you . " The house telephone suddenly rang on his desk , and he started , for it had broken the intense and terrible silence . He lifted the receiver . " Jon ? " said his mother . " Would n't you like to have a cup of tea with Jenny and me ? " " No , dear . "  | " I know you 're there , brooding . It is n't good for you , Jon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Not while she 's there . " Marjorie sighed . " It 's getting dusk . Wo n't you drive jenny to the bank ? " " No , Mother . I never do . What 's the matter with Jim ? " " Nothing . But I do n't like you brooding . " " I 'm not brooding . I do n't brood . I 'm just clearing things out . " Marjorie sighed again . " Very well , Jon . But do come home soon . Jenny is about to leave . " " Give her my love . " He slammed the receiver back on the telephone . He sat staring at nothing for a long time , while the twilight deepened . A man 's whole life . The best years of his life . It had come to nothing at all . It had been destroyed in a single moment , and the years were as if they had never existed . He looked into the dark hollow place which must absorb the rest of his life . He opened another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a glass , and began to drink . Mrs. James Morgan looked about the suite so anxiously prepared for her by her son . " It really is n't very elegant , " she said in a discontented voice . " Mama , it 's the very best this town can offer . I know . " She leaned on her two canes and gazed with deeper discontent at everything . " It 's not what I 'm accustomed to , in the home . " She turned to Robert . " Tomorrow , " she said , " if I am a little better , we must look at the four homes you mentioned , my dear . " He could not help himself . He said , " You mean the houses , Mama . " She frowned . For some reason he was not now intimidated at her frowns . " Homes , dear Robert . " " Mama . A house in which one lives becomes a home to those who live there . But other people 's houses are not homes . ' You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' only houses . " He took a deep breath . " To call other people 's houses homes ' is a vulgarism . " " Indeed ! Did you learn that silliness in this little town , which would n't fit in a corner of Philadelphia ? " " I 'm learning a lot of things I never knew before  --  Mother . And Hambledon may be small , but it is alive . " " I do n't think I 'm going to like it . Why do you call me Mother ' ? " " Because you are my mother , and I 'm no longer a child . " She stared at him indomitably , but he stared back at her , smiling . " Indeed , " she said , again . But she was frightened . Was she about to  | lose her son , as she had lost her husband ? The thought was incredible and alarming . But he had become very strange and seemed taller and very male . This was revolting . " I feel faint , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with a glass of fresh water , " she added . Robert brought her water . He was smiling again . " I am not well , " she complained . " All this dampness ? " " Would you like an Aspirin tablet ? " " Robert ! I never take drugs ! I bear my arthritis like a Christian . " " Pain that can he alleviated should be . It 's not valiant to suffer unnecessary pain . " " How you have changed , Robert ! In these few short days ! I hope that horrible man , I ) r . Ferrier , do n't corrupt you . " " ' Does n't ' is the word , Mother . ' Do n't ' is plural , not singular . " " Are you correcting my English now , Robert ? " She was very agitated . " Mother , you are among strangers , in Hambledon . In Philadelphia you had friends who overlooked your errors . Forgive me , but it is true . " " My father was an intellectual minister ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning , but he taught me , himself . " He did n't teach you much , then , thought the incalcitrant Robert . Then he gentled . " Mother , I 'm only trying to help . " " You are impertinent , Robert . You are ungrateful . First , you decline to practice in Philadelphia , where we have old , devoted friends . Then you decide on this miserable little country place and come under the influence of a frightful man  --  I know it ! ? who do n't , I mean does n't , have any reputation among respectable people . You bring me here , in this damp town , with my arthritis , and insist on me leaving all my friends ? " " Mother , you need n't stay here , if you do n't like it . You can always live in Philadelphia . " " Leave you stay here , alone ? Alone ! Among corruptions ? You must think I 'm an unnatural mother ! Robert , how could you have possibly believed that ? " Robert was silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rented our home , for a very good rental . You are all I 've got , Robert . " " You have all my aunts in Philadelphia , and my cousins . " " My only child ! Thrown to the heathen . " 1 must be patient , thought Robert . She said , " That murderer ! And to think my only chill has been influenced by him ! It 's criminal . He should be driven from the country . " Robert sighed . " Ile was acquitted , Mother . " " We 've conic to a pretty pass , in this nation , when criminals can be loosed on the publiy again to continue their crimes . " She put her hand-  | kerchief to her dry eyes . " I only know this , Robert : He will never enter the home so long as I am alive . " " I do n't think he 'll come without an invitation . Mother , would n't you like to lie down before dinner ? " She was tempted not because she was really in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her revenge against her family . But Robert was " strange , " and her fright quickened . She must know more of this mystery in order to defend herself . She said , " I am too stimulated by that dreadful journey , and all the soot and the noise . It was my first experience in traveling . I did n't like it . Those vulgar people ! " " It was only four hours , Mother , and you traveled Pullman . " " Four hours of sheer misery , Robert ! You do n't know what it means to be a delicate female . " Thank God , thought Robert . " Well , it 's over now . We can make plans . The house nearest the offices is smaller than the others I looked at , but it 's very comfortable . Four nice bedrooms , with a good view . And servants are cheaper than in Philadelphia . There 's a nice garden and really pleasant lawns . The price is very reasonable , too . I think you 'll like it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert , one for me , the other two for servants . Where shall our guests sleep ? " " We can build another bedroom onto the house . There is a lot of land . " " Expensive ! What do they want for the home ? " " Only ten thousand dollars . " " Exorbitant ! In this little country place ! " " It 's in the best section . By the way , Mrs. Ferrier has asked you to tea , tomorrow , if you feel well enough . " He added , " She is considered the first lady in Hambledon , Mother . " " I should n't dream ? You said , the first lady ' ? How could that be , with her son a murderer ? " " Mother , the judge and the jury decided he was n't a murderer ! Please remember that . If you call him a murderer , here , you can be sued for libel . Well . I must decline the invitation , then ? " " Oh , how my poor head aches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say so ? How you confuse me ! " " Suppose you think of it tomorrow ? You 'll know better , then , how you feel . " " Sleeping in that bed , there . " Her thin high voice was full of selfpity . " How can we be sure it do n't have vermin ? " " Mother , it 's very clean , I assure you . The word is does n't , ' not don't. ' "  | He looked down at her . She was a gaunt woman and almost as tall as himself . She had obstinately worn her widow 's black weeds over all these years , " as was proper . " She was sixty years old , for she had been long a spinster before she had married James Morgan , an impoverished young physician eight years her junior . He had , frankly , married her for her money . Her father had indeed been a minister , but he had inherited a considerable fortune from a bachelor uncle , a scoundrel who had , however , admired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from a possible hell . " It ai n't that I believe in hell , " he had said to his lawyers . " But you never can tell , can you ? Better hedge my bets . " Jane Morgan had , in the course of events , inherited her father 's money , she being a spinster and her two brothers affluent in their own industrious right . Her father had never expected that " poor Jane " would ever marry , with her long severe face , her cold gray eyes , her wide thin mouth and her dim brown hair . And , worst of all , her stupidity and rigid character . So he had mercifully provided for her future , not dreaming that a young Dr. James Morgan , fresh out of medical school , would ever see her and decide to marry her , long after his own death . The dim brown hair was thin and white now , and Jane Morgan stubbornly covered it with a cotton and lace cap , as in the days of her Victorian youth . Ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were really not ladies . Her long nose had become sharper and whiter and thinner over the years , and beaked down over her grim mouth , which was surrounded by deep lines . Everything about her was rigorous and uncompromising . She had been thirty-four when Robert had been born and had been firmly fixed in her pattern of living and convictions . Sex had been a most horrendous experience for her , and she had never recovered from the " shame " and indignity of her son 's birth . Yet , in the silently feverish and unpliant ways of spinsters she had violently adored her young husband and had almost devoured him . He had , thought young Robert now , in sympathy , consoled himself somewhat with a gay young widow in Philadelphia , and a number of other ladies of happy character , all of them encountered in his examination rtxnns . In his boyhood Robert had been horrified at this " betrayal " of his mother by that " nastiness " and " unspeakable affront " to her wifehood . Now he congratulated his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked down on his mother now , was reprehensible of him . I-ic smiled . He doubted that even his ministergrandfather would have condemned poor young James . Robert said , " I 've ordered a nice little dinner for us here in the suite , Mother . Your favorites : chicken broth , lean lamb chops , creamed  | potatoes , a little buttered turnip , a salad , and some tarts and fruit and cheese . Shall I ring for it now ? " " I do n't believe I can take anything , Robert , but a little cinnamon toast and lemon hot tea . " Only a month ago he would have cajoled and persuaded her . But now he said , " Very well . I 'll cancel the order , and give your own , and I 'll go down to the dining room and have my dinner for myself . It would be wrong of me to nauseate you by having my big dinner upstairs . " " Let you eat alone in a public dining room ? Robert ! " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have n't been seduced yet . " Unfortunately , he added to himself . " Robert ! What shameless talk is this ? No , I will sacrifice my natural revulsion . Order the dinner , Robert . " " Only one order ? For myself ? " She looked up at him sharply . She did n't like that easy tone , that indifferent tone , from a son ordinarily most solicitous . " I will sacrifice myself , " she repeated . Robert , smiling under his red-gold mustache , rang for the double dinner . He then excused himself to wash in his own room . He hummed when he went down the corridor . Poor old girl . She was a terrible bore and prig , and , yes , vulgar . The moment she was certain her son had left , Mrs. Morgan briskly put aside her canes and moved smartly to the windows to look down on the town . The sidewalks were gleaming with moisture in the dusk . Umbrellas moved in a solid phalanx below , and the gaslights were lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rain . But the lamps were scattered , and it was very quiet . Horrid little town . Her Robert would soon tire of it , and then they 'd return to civilization , in Philadelphia . Well , she 'd see . She 'd have tea with that woman tomorrow and let her know that Mrs. Morgan was condescending to her , she the mother of a murderer . " I really can not force myself to eat anything , " she complained to Robert when the table was laid in her suite and the savory food set before her . " Oh , that 's too bad , " said Robert , taking up his soup spoon with enthusiasm . " This is very tasty . Do try a sip . " She ate a very hearty dinner , even more than Robert , and complained and sighed and murmured dolorously all through it . As a thrifty woman she deftly tucked two buttered rolls into her handkerchief for later nibbling . After all , she told herself , she slept badly . And waste was sinful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to encourage gorging in servants , who were allowed leftovers . " Two dollars for this dinner , Robert ? Do they think you are a millionaire ? "  | " An odious woman , really , " said Marjorie Ferrier to her son two days later . " So affected . She spent most of teatime preening and condescending and bragging genteelly and talking in what she doubtlessly considered a very ' refined ' way . How could such a nice gentlemanly boy like young Robert have such a mother ? " " And how could such a nice mother like you have such odious sons ? " Jonathan asked her . " It 's all inheritance from distant ancestors . " " My sons are not odious , " said Marjorie . " Here , dear , do try this English marmalade . You are n't eating very well these days . What a wonderful morning ! It 's bright and warm again . I think I 'll work in the rose garden . Where are you going now , Jon ? " " Taking young Galahad on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Of what , dear ? " " It does n't matter . Nothing matters any longer . " But everything always mattered too much for you , my son , thought Marjorie with a sigh , as her son gave her a brief kiss and left . She clenched her slight hands on her knees and closed her fine hazel eyes . Would there never be an answer to her prayers ? How could she live alone here , in this big house , without Jon ? All her dreams had come to nothing . There were no grandchildren , there was no happy laughter anywhere . There was no gay coming here any longer , as once there was , when Mavis was alive and Jon was busy . Jon ? She thought about it . When had he stopped smiling that quick dark smile of his ? A year after he had married Mavis ? Two years ? Three ? He had stopped within six months . Oh , God , thought Marjorie , if only Mavis had never been born ! If only Jon had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth ! But life , it seemed , was tragically made up of " if onlys . " She knew it was best for Jonathan to leave Hambledon and never return , but her opinion was not based on his nor those who knew him . There were times when she felt she could not wait for him to go  --  for every day was a day of danger and impending terror , and pretense . " This Is a fine new rig you have , " said Jonathan to Robert Morgan . " Good hone , too . When did you buy it ? " " Yesterday . " Robert gave him a sunny smile . " Like it ? I do , too .  | I heard the horse had been sired by one of your own . My mother was upset . " " Why ? " " The expense . She thought I should hire a buggy for a while , instead of buying one . I do n't think she 's joyful over this town . Besides , Mother is very  --  well , I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll remember , that my father did n't have much money of his own ; he did a lot of charity work ; too much , according to Mother . What we have belongs to Mother . Of course , I 'm her only heir , but sometimes it makes things difficult . " " Well , widows have to be providential , " said Jonathan . " I 'm hardly a profligate son , " said Robert . " I worked in drugstores when I was n't in school , and mother told all her friends that she did n't consider it very nice , ' but that I was an independent boy and I had insisted . The truth is , Mama was always very near with the cash ; thought if I did n't have any I 'd not get entangled with females , or something . I had to have more than the two dollars a week she gave me when I was in college  --  so I worked . Waited on tables , and such . A lot of the fellows looked down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the money Mama has . Dear Mama . " " Where 'd you get the money from to buy this outfit , then ? " Robert laughed , and proudly held the reins . " I charged it to my mother . She 'll get the bill soon . The funny thing about it is that she never asked me how I bought it , acting on the principle that if she did not ask there 'd be no bill , and no unpleasantness . " " You 'll soon have plenty of money of your own , once you 're established here , " said Jonathan . " I 've shown you my rates ; do n't come down on them . They 're a little higher than average , but then you 're an authentic doctor and not a quack . There 's something else I 've wanted to talk to you about . When I was a kid most doctors had only the most elementary medical educations , having merely studied under physicians and gone the rounds with them for two or three years , and reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage , of course , but a lot of them did a lot of good . They developed , or were born with , a smell . ' They could smell out illnesses on merely entering a room and could make a prompt and accurate diagnosis on the spot . A sort of sixth sense . Every real doctor has that , even in these days of scientific diagnosis , ' but it 's not held in good repute any longer . The more we begin to rely strictly on laboratory findings , the more dull hacks  --  though out of good medical schools  --  we 'll find ourselves afflicted with , and any man with well-off parents can aspire to be a physician , whether he 's fit for it or not . Just for the prestige . Potential carpenters and blacksmiths in operating rooms .  | " Do n't take the corners too fast with this horse . I had his dam , too , and she had a way of cutting around . Well . I 'm not against full laboratory procedures ; I do a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have too much of it ; I 've seen some tragic errors , when doctors go by the laboratory and not by common sense and careful , personal diagnoses . Of course the hacks could n't practice medicine any other way , if we did n't have laboratories these days , so perhaps many lives are saved . But nothing beats an eye , an ear , and a sense of smell , that sixth sense I 've been telling you about . " " And you 're afraid I might not have it ? " " We 'll see . Beginning today . Even if you do n't , and are careful , and lean heavily on the laboratories , you ca n't do much harm . Now , when I was a boy we knew a physician in a tall silk hat , stock , chains , and the usual frock coat and striped trousers and spats and a goldheaded cane . Almost illiterate . Big bearded bastard with a voice like an organ chord . He 'd ' studied medicine ' under another just like himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met a more acute diagnostician and never a man , even a modern physician , who could cure faster . " I used to have what they called a chest ' in those days . I stank up every classroom with the bag of camphor my mother hung about my neck , and I reeked with asafetida , too . That 's what really made me a good boxer . I had to be . Then there was goose grease , steeping feet in hot water and big doses of castor oil . I was supposed to sweat it out . Well , one winter my chest was worse than usual , and our family doctor had influenza , and we called in Dr. Bogus . He walked into the bedroom where I was coughing my lungs out , sniffed around the room , said ' Ah , ' came to the bed , looked up my nose and down my throat , and said , ' Where 's the cat ? ' " Now , we always had cats in the house , two or three at least . Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I hauled under the bed and brought up my favorite pussy . ' There 's the villain , or villainness , ' said Dr. Bogus , and picked up pussy and gently threw her out of the room . It seems I was sensitive to cats , but no one had ever suggested it before . I have them still , on the farms , but not in the house . And I still get a ' chest ' if I go into a house where a pussy is in residence . Everybody laughed at Dr. Bogus , but he was right , you we . And everybody who laughed still called him in emergencies when real doctors were baffled . He had a nose . " " We can diagnose sensitiveness to animals , or whatever , without having a now , now . " " True . What are they beginning to call it now ? Allergies . They 're still mysterious . Why does one man drop dead if he takes an egg and  | another can have half a dozen of them for breakfast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sickening word . No one knows exactly why some proteins can kill some people and not affect others . Allergens , they call them these days . But why ? We still do n't know . Dr. Bogus did n't know either ; he 'd never heard of allergies to the day he died . But he knew they existed , just as Aristotle knew the nature of an atom even though he 'd never known any scientific instruments . And today our scientists are talking about the atom ' as if no one had ever proposed the theory before or written down a hypothesis . Dr. Bogus , I bet , could outdo any of your teachers at Johns Hopkins when it came to a diagnosis , even if he could rarely pronounce the name of the disease correctly and did n't know Latin from Sanskrit . He could lay his ear for a second to a man 's chest , and look into his eyes and come up with the exact thing that ailed his heart . And his weird concoctions , witchdoctor stuff , really , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost magic qualities , though I doubt he knew what the hell most of the ingredients honestly were , or how or why they worked . " " My father told me about men like that , " said Robert , with doubt . " Me , I 'm the real laboratory diagnostician . " But Jonathan did not laugh . He said , " That 's not enough . I expect more from you than that . That 's why I picked you over the others . " " Thanks , " said Robert . " The others , " said Jonathan , " were strictly scientific chaps . That 's not enough . We 're going to St. Hilda 's first . There 're a couple of cases , or so , that I want you to diagnose . " " By my sixth sense ? " " By your sixth sense . You strike me as a real doctor ; I do n't want to be disappointed . Take Leonardo da Vinci . He designed submarines , and was laughed at for centuries . But now we not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , but we are beginning to design them , too . He designed flying-machines , and now we have men working on such things , and , frankly , I 'm afraid of them . The faster we get into communication with our fellows the faster we 'll learn to hate them . The sentimental used to carol that the telephone , by making instant communication possible , would clear up all misunderstandings and foster a spirit of brotherly love . Instead of that it has become an instrument of invasion ; anyone can invade your house if you have a telephone , and most of the time it 's a lot of nonsense . And a lot of the time you resent the caller , and start to hate his guts . Science is going to make the new world a pretty threatening place . " " Anti-progress , I see . " " Do n't laugh so smugly , boy . The more weapons you give a man the more dangerous he becomes , and science is just on the threshold of  | supplying mankind with really big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand-to-hand in battle it gave them some respect for life , even if they killed in the name of whatever . But a rifle , and a cannon  --  they are only instruments of destruction and you never see the man you murdered , so how can you respect his manhood ? Watch that corner . It 's pretty busy . " The streets simmered with the warm June sun and the lawns danced with the shadows of the great old trees . Children were racing to school , swinging their books on straps , little boys in knickerbockers , little girls in bright summer cottons and with ribbons in their hair . Small towns , thought Robert , masterfully handling the reins , have a lot to commend them . There 's a certain close quality about them , a sense of nearness . He said , " I do n't think that isolating one 's self is the best way to get along with others . " " But it 's a lot safer , " said Jonathan . " Besides , who wants their affection ? That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Give me respect , any time . An island is better than an anthill . One of these days we 'll run out of islands , of any kind , and you 'll see the heartiest massacres of whole populations . If you live long enough , and pray you do n't . Man just ca n't stand too much of his fellowman . " " You 're making me melancholy . " " Melancholy was highly esteemed by the Greeks . Do n't underestimate it . Did you ever see a fool who was depressed , really depressed ? No . Melancholy , and all the other mental ills , seem the prerogative of the intelligent . You 've got to know the world to conclude you ca n't stand it . " Robert hesitated . " May I ask you a personal question ? Thanks . Were you such a misanthrope before your  --  your  --  trouble ? " " You mean before I was on trial for killing my wife and child ? Well , do n't use euphemisms . Yes , I think I was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one yet , I advise you to cultivate misanthropy . Then nobody will catch you flat-footed , no one will cheat you , no one will stick a knife in your back . You 'll always be looking for such things and you 'll never be disappointed . But you 'll be forewarned , and that 's a blessed thing . " School bells were ringing , and churches were chiming nine o'clock ; distant dogs harked lazily . A water wagon was roaming slowly along the streets , wetting down the gutters and making little black rivers among the cobblestones . A scent of moistened dust rose in the air , plcas.uttly , and from somewhere came the passionately sweet scent of a linden tree . And always , over it all , the fragrance of garden roses , hot with life tinder the sun . So peaceful , thought Robert . " The thing we have to learn , all of us now , is that peace is on the  | way out as a condition of existence , " said Jonathan . " How do I know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distress ' that Germany is crowding the British out of what they call their traditional markets : " " So ? " " Now , what the hell did men ever fight for , in all the history of the world , except for markets and new territories ? And a right to exploit ? Or money ? All the high-sounding things do n't mean a damn . Our own Civil War , as Lincoln , himself , explained it , was not to free slaves but to preserve the Union , and he wanted to preserve the Union because he knew that two weak divided countries where once there was one strong one , would be an invitation to European adventurers . Why our own Revolution ? The old boys considered themselves loyal subjects of His Majesty , ' almost to the last . They just rightfully resented having their money  --  their money , you will observe  --  being taken away from them in taxes for the old country 's benefit . There can be no freedom without private property , and money is private property , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property which meant our liberty . That 's why I say now that I was never so alarmed before as when hearing the British Parliament express itself , in its gentlemanly way , as being distressed ' over bustling Germany 's vigorous invasion of British foreign markets . I 'm scared to death . " Robert could not imagine Jonathan Ferrier being " scared to death " over anything . He remembered the accounts in the newspapers of Jonathan 's disdain of both judge and jury , his black impatience , his gloomy contempt . Yet , his life had been in the hands of those men ; he had not feared them at all . " Here we are . Jewel-like St. Hilda 's , ' as some lady once called it . " They had arrived at the somewhat elaborate wrought-iron gates of the small hospital . Beyond were wide gravel drives and handsome lawns and elms and neat flower beds and benches for convalescents . The hospital itself was of shining white brick with red chimneys and blueshuttered windows and even curtains against the glass of the expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not a hospital at all . Some nurses in white were guiding patients over the grass , or wheeling them in chairs , and everything sparkled freshly and someone was cutting grass and the fragrance was delicious on the warm air . " Well , it looks as a hospital should look , and not a barracks , " said Robert . A man came running , as they drove up to the white steps , and caught the horse 's bridle . The two doctors jumped to the ground and they entered the hospital through doors opened wide to the fresh breeze and the odor of growing things . It was cool and light inside , the  | inlaid linoleum polished on every one of its yellow squares , and the hall was lined with comfortable chairs and tables . A nurse at a desk looked up , saw Jonathan ; her face closed . She said , " Good morning , Dr. Ferrier . And Dr. Morgan . " The hospital was four-stories high , and very hushed , the corridors , in spite of Jonathan 's protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the patients who could afford St. Hilda 's had delicate sensibilities and they could not endure clacking noise . " And the hell with being sanitary , " Jonathan had told Robert . " It 's a wonder they did n't carpet the operating rooms , too , and the water closets . A lot of the more costly rooms do have rugs in them ; there 're still a lot of pompous quacks who do n't believe in germs , or , if forced to look at them through microscopes murmur that they 're interesting little creatures . ' " The very few patients whom he had recently accepted  --  and who had believed in him in the blackest of times  --  were on the second floor . So the two young men walked up the wide white-painted stairs , which wound up to the top in a graceful spiral . The hospital hummed with a soft busyness ; nurses passed them or approached them ; doctors with bags stopped to gossip to each other . Jonathan ignored them all , even those who tentatively greeted him . Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and when they spoke to him pleasantly , glancing furtively at the silent Jonathan , he replied with a little too much effusiveness . His bag felt hot in his hand . Jonathan swung open a broad door into a big and comfortable room full of sun . His manner changed at once . " Well , how are we this morning , Martha ? " A little girl , not more than ten , was listlessly lying on heaped pillows , her fair hair streaming about her shoulders . Robert had not seen her before . Jonathan took up her chart from the white dresser , glanced over it swiftly , frowned . " This is Martha Best , " he said to Robert . " The daughter of one of my closest friends , Howard Best , a lawyer . In fact , I 'm her godfather . Are n't I , Martha ? " His face had become gentle for all its darkness , and he went to the child and bent and kissed her cheek . She caught his hand , her blue eyes fixed anxiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't 1 , Uncle Jon ? " " I hope so , " he said . " Are n't you going to speak to Dr. Morgan ? " The child eyed him shyly but did not speak . When he said , " Hello , Martha , " she bent her head and the golden hair fell like a curtain over her cheeks . " Now , Martha , l ) r . Morgan is going to help me with you , " said Jonathan . " Ile looks like a big red bear , does n't he , but he does n't bite little girls . Honestly , " The child giggled convulsively , and peeped up at Robert . Jonathan  | gave him the chart . " Acute anemia . Intractable fever of 102 ? . History of severe infection of throat , now reduced . Present slight infection of lungs and nose . Joint pains . Transient bleeding from mouth , bowels , kidneys and nose . Slight liver enlargement . Spleen perceptibly enlarged . Lymph nodes discernible . Pallor . Lassitude . Diagnosis of admitting physician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heart involvement . Family physician 's diagnosis : " There was , as yet , no diagnosis recorded from Dr. Jonathan Ferrier . Robert laid down the chart . He looked searchingly at the little girl , at her ghostly color , at the lack of pinkness in her lips , at the bluish hollows under her eyes . He thought of something . It sickened him . He had never seen a case Jonathan was watching him sharply . " Martha has been slightly sick , so her parents told me yesterday , when I sent her here , for four weeks . A little cold , they said . Then two days ago she became really sick , and they called me . She came in last night . Well ? " Robert went slowly to the little girl who was now staring at him inquisitively . He took her hand ; it was chill and faintly tremulous . She let him examine her throat . He took out his stethoscope and listened to her heart . It was a little more rapid than in health , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very pale , but her gums were congested . A holy medal , of gold , and on a thin gold chain , hung about her neck , and on the bed table beside her was a rosary . Robert gently dropped her hand ; he stared at the silver crucifix on the rosary . He was silent . " Well ? " said Jonathan . His voice was curiously muffled . " You 've taken blood ? There does n't seem to be any reference to a blood test on the chart . I  --  I 'd like to see if there are any blast forms ? and the leukocyte count . " Jonathan sighed . " Am I very sick ? " said the little girl with anxiety . " Uncle Louis said I had rheumatism . Am I going to be a cripple ? " " Uncle Louis , " Jonathan began , " is an old ? " He stopped . " Of course , you are n't going to be a cripple , Martha . In fact , when this fever goes down a little you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can go home . " He added , " You can go home . " A cheerful nurse came in , all rosy dimples and bounce , with a white cap on her high black pompadour . " Good morning , Doctors ! " she sang . " We are doing very well this morning ! We had a lovely little breakfast , too , and enjoyed it ! Did n't we , Martha ? " " Yes , ma'am , " the child said with politeness . " And such a pretty nightgown ! " said the happy nurse , admiring the white silk , embroidered garment Martha wore . " Such a nice sleep in it . "  | " Bob , " said Jonathan , " this is one of Martha 's private nurses , Mrs. Chapman . Mrs. Chapman , Dr. Morgan , my replacement . " " How nice , " said the pleasant woman vaguely . " Bring me a glass slide from the laboratory , " said Jonathan . " And quickly , please . " He sat down on the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Martha , I 'm going to prick your ear and take a little blood from you . It wo n't hurt much ; just a little . You are n't going to make a fuss , are you ? " The child immediately looked frightened . Jonathan took one of her hands and held it warmly . " I do n't like to bleed , Uncle Jon , " she said . " It makes me sick to look at it . " " I wo n't let you sec it , then . You just keep your eyes closed , and when I tell you to open them you wo n't see any blood at all . How 's Tommie ? " he asked , referring to her infant brother . " I le has a cold , too , " said Martha . " Not very bad , though , like mine . His knees are n't swollen , either . " She smiled affectionately . " He 's better than all my dolls . " " Of course he is . Your mother will be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time we 'll know exactly what 's wrong with you  --  and when you can go home . " " And I do n't have rheumatism ? " Jonathan looked at Robert , and the child looked at him . " No , " said Robert . " You do n't have rheumatism , Martha . " He tried to hold Jonathan 's eyes but they shifted away from him . There was a sudden hard silence in the room . " What do I have , then ? " asked Martha with the curiosity of childhood , and the importance . " We have to look  --  at things  --  first , " said Robert , and felt sick . " You mean , it is n't had at all ? " she said in her chirping voice . She was a little disappointed . " Be cheerful and optimistic at all times before the patient , " Robert had been sternly taught . " Never indicate by tone or manner that the patient is gravely ill , or in a terminal condition . " He thought it nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . low did one say to a child , " Darling , you are going to die " ? Please , Cod , he said in himself , let me he mistaken . After all , I 've never seen a single case before . I could he wrong . Let me be wrong . He gaud at the child and saw her beauty and the sweetness of her eyes . Ile turned away and walked slowly to the window and looked outside and saw nothing . It was wrong for the young and lovely to die ! They had a celebration to make to life . Life was not a joyous thing in itself ? he knew that , for he was a doctor and had seen too much pain and  | death and had heard too many desolate cries . But it was like spring , in its infrequent periods , and a child had a right to spring . He heard the door open and shut and the bright voice of Mrs. Chapman , bringing the slide . " Now , Martha , " Jonathan was saying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little prick . Tell me , how is school ? " " I do n't like it , Uncle ? Oh ! " she cried . " There . Just two seconds . Keep those eyes closed . Good girl ! Mrs. Chapman , take it to the laboratory and set it up . We 'll join you in a few minutes . Martha ? It 's all over . You can open your eyes now . It did n't really hurt , did it ? " She gave a small dry sob , then smiled . Robert turned at the window ; % the sun made a halo of the child 's silken hair . " No , it really did n't hurt . Much . Uncle Jon , Father McNulty called the hospital and he 's coming to see me today . Is n't that nice ? " " Wonderful , " said Jonathan . " Fine . " Robert saw his face , and turned away again . " And now , " said Jonathan , " we 'll leave you for a few moments to count all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " He rose and the two doctors left the room . Jonathan closed the door slowly and heavily . He said , " Well , Doctor , what is your on-the-spot diagnosis ? " Robert could not remember when he had last felt so wretched and sad . " I hope I 'm wrong , " he said . " After all , I know  --  it  --  only from textbooks . I never saw a case . " Of what ? " Robert hesitated . " Acute leukemia . Extremely rare . " Jonathan was silent . His head was bent . " Tell me I 'm wrong , " Robert pleaded . " That 's a beautiful little girl ? " " Let 's look at the slide , " said Jonathan , and they went to the laboratories , not speaking as they walked through the long corridors . In that same silence they soon returned to Martha 's room . They heard her giggling as they opened the door . Dr. Louis Hedler was sitting near the bed in a comfortable chintz wing chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turned his head when he saw the younger doctors , and nodded pleasantly and held out his soft fat hand . He more than ever resembled an amiable toad , and his head and face were completely bare of hair and his nose was snub and broad . " Morning , Jon , " he said . " Morning , Dr. Morgan . Hear you are joining us on the staff . Fine . Hope you 'll be happy with us . " He shook Robert 's hand vigorously . " Now , what 's this I hear ? You took blood from Martha , with a big knife , she says . Why ? " He was still smiling happily , but the huge brown eyes were hard and penetrating . " Just for fun , " said Jonathan . " We like to hurt little girls , Louis . "  | " I did write down that I thought Martha had anemia , as well as , ahem , rheumatism . What did your precious slides show ? " " Anemia . " " Obvious , obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be alarmed about . It 's those joint pains that worry me . And a suspicion about her heart ? " " Never discuss a patient 's condition in his presence , " Robert had been taught . But Dr. ! Wirt. , Jonathan had said , was a " diploma-mill " doctor . He had never been taught that a patient was hardly sentient and was always totally ignorant . " Uncle Jon said I was n't very sick , " said the child , with new anxiety at the mention of her heart . " Of course y ' n'rr not sick ! " cried Dr. I ! edler , with immense joviality . " I ? or rather , Jon here will prescribe an iron tonic for you and you 'll s'x'n br as right as rain ! I promise you . " Ile stood up and patted the child 's check , but she was looking at Jonathan for confirmation . " Do n't worry , Martha , " he said . " There is n't anything wrong with your heart . " l ) r . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've a case down the hall 1 'd like to discuss with you . " " One of yours ? Do n't tell me , Jon , that you give a fig for my opinion ! " " There 's always a first time , " said the younger doctor . " Coming , Bob ? Martha , I 'll come in again before I leave . " Jon carefully shut the door behind him , and the three doctors stood alone in the carpeted corridor . " Well ? " said Dr. Hedler , with impatience . " Where is your patient ? " " You 've just seen her , Louis . And we just came from the laboratories , remember . " " Yes , yes , so you said ! You and your highfalutin slides and tests ! Anemia , that 's what you said , is n't it ? " " To Martha , yes . To you , no . " He turned to Robert . " Dr. Morgan guessed it at first examination ; it was only confirmed by the blood test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Acute leukemia , " said Robert . I ) r . Ilcdler 's mouth fell open with an audible sound . His eyes popped . He swung to Jonathan . " Why , you 're crazy ! Jonathan , you do n't believe what a young fella just out of the ranks of interns says , do yore ? ? " I do . I believed it last night , before the blood test . " " Crazy , crazy ! Never heard anything so preposterous in my life ! It 's insane . Why , that disease is so rare that hardly any of us see a case for ourselves in a whole lifetime ! As rare as an angel in hell ! " " It depends on the kind of angel , " said Jonathan . " Louis , stop gulping .  | The child has acute leukemia . I 'd tell you exactly what we saw in the smear but they 'd be only words to you . You must take our word for it . " " You arrogant young pup , with your scientific ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know what you 're doing ? You 're condemning that beautiful little girl to death ! " " Not I , " said Jonathan . " God did . " " Blasphemous , too . " Dr. Hedler was sweating though the corridor was cool . He regarded Jonathan with hatred . " No , I wo n't take your word for it ! The child has rheumatic fever ? " " You 're not her physician , Louis . I am . " Dr. Hedler breathed heavily . He was incredulous . " Are you going to tell her parents this  --  this enormity , this guess of yours ? " " It is n't a guess , Louis . I 've seen eight cases over the past ten years . It 's becoming more common . Twenty years ago only one doctor in a thousand ever saw a case ; thirty years ago only one doctor in five thousand saw one . But the Greeks had a name for it : the White Sickness . Remember Hippocrates ? He diagnosed it . " " I forbid you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible thing ! If it were possibly true , it would be bad enough . But a mere guess ? " " Not a guess . Louis , she is n't your patient . You ca n't forbid me to tell the truth to my patient 's parents , even if you are Chief-of-Staff . And I 'm going to tell them , today . They must be prepared . The child has only a little while to live , at the best . And there 's no treatment , Louis . " " Cancer of the blood ! That 's what you mean , is n't it ? Cancer , at her age ! " " One child in twenty thousand now has cancer in some form , Louis . Do n't you read the medical journals ? " Dr. Hedler seemed about to strike him . " The child has rheumatism , rheumatic fever ! I 've seen hundreds of cases . I was never wrong once . And I 'll tell Howard and Beth that you are a fool , and not to believe you . Leukemia ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waddled off , trembling with fury . " Hambledon 's crowning medical glory , " said Jonathan . " Smiling old Louis . " " Could n't we have a medical consultation ? " Robert asked with misery . " Someone from Johns Hopkins ? " Jonathan regarded him narrowly . " Do n't you trust your own diagnosis ? And mine ? " " I never saw a case , " said Robert , " before this . " " I told you , I 've seen eight . Not in this hospital , though , and not in the other hospital in town . In Pittsburgh . In New York . In Boston . In Philadelphia . Martha 's case is classic . Well ? "  | Robert studied his large pink hands . " There 's no cure ; there 's no treatment . There are remissions ? " " Not for long . And not always . Do you want to lie to her parents , Bob ? " " No . No , of course not . You do n't mean it , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . I did n't . " Jonathan smiled with bleak pity at him . " But I 'd like you to be present . Break you in . " And now for my other cases . I 'm leaving them to you , Bob , with my compliments . " CHAPTER SEVEN " ' The quality of mercy is not strained , ' except that God never heard that particular saying , " said Jonathan , pushing open another door which led into a handsome suite of rooms consisting of a private bathroom , sitting room and bedroom , all cheerfully and expensively furnished and open to sun and wind and perfumed by many flowers . Jonathan put his hand on Robert 's arm and said to him in a low voice , " This is a very interesting case . Old Jonas Witherby , eighty years old , old settler , old money , old mansion , good old bonds and stocks and fine old land . I want your opinion . " They went together through the sitting room to the bedroom where , in a Morris rocker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tranquil face Robert had ever seen among elderly people . He was small and daintily made , with tiny hands and feet and a noble head richly flowing with white and rippling hair . He had the eyes of a young child , clear and blue and steadfast , a snub nose , a sweetly smiling mouth and pink ears . He sat by the window looking at the sunshine and smiling musingly , and when he turned his long head Robert felt , warmth and peace rising in him and something very close to affection . " Ah , clear Jonathan , " said Mr. Witherby , holding out one hand to the older doctor and winking . " I never see you without pleasure . How are you this glorious clay ? " " Just terrible , Jonas , " said Jonathan . " Everything 's just as bad as it can be . By the way , this is my replacement , Dr. Robert Morgan . " The old man clung to Jonathan 's hand and smiled merrily at Robert , then became sad . " I low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get younger all the time . Replacement for Jonathan , eh ? You must truly persuade him to change his mind . What will Hambledon do without him ? " " Just jog along as meanly as ever , " said Jonathan . Ile sat clown in  | another chair , crossed his long legs and put his hands in his pockets and studied Mr. Witherby with an ambiguous expression . " Never mind . We wo n't repeat the old arguments for Bob 's benefit . As he will replace me I am turning you over to him . With your permission , of course . " " Certainly , certainly , dear boy ! " Mr. Witherby smiled more radiantly than before and considered Robert with great interest . " Anyone you recommend ? " Jonathan stood up in his dark blue suit and gave the appearance , all at once , of extreme emaciation . He took Mr. Witherby 's chart , frowned at it , laid it down . " Still weak , I see . Still eating like that proverbial bird ; I know birds ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . But your nurses note down , ate breakfast like a bird . ' Silly old hags . How did you sleep ? " Mr. Witherby sighed . " Please sit down , Dr. Morgan . You will find that chair very comfortable ; I like to look at young faces . Well , Jonathan , you know at my age one does n't sleep very well at all . I think , lying awake all night . " " And you have plenty to think about . " Jonathan , still standing near the bowered dresser , looked at Robert . " Old Jonas here was a widower . Tvyo sons , one fifty-three , one fifty-one . Both married , both deserted by their wives . Bill is in a private madhouse , Donald is a chronic alcoholic . D.T.s , most of the time . In a private sanitarium which dries him out then looses him again . No daughters . No grandchildren . Wife , " said Jonathan in the bald tone of a clinician , " committed suicide . Very sad , would n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which seemed cruel . He bent his head with apology to Mr. Witherby as if in some way he were guilty of Jonathan . But Mr. Witherby 's fine old face took on a sad melancholy and dejection and he folded his hands with resignation on his knees . " It was always said that I had everything , from birth , but in reality , in my old age , I have nothing . " Jonathan snapped a pink rosebud from a vase and fixed it in his buttonhole . He was detached as if no one were in this room but himself . He said , " Languid , listless , tired , enfeebled , anorexia , vague but disabling pains , sometimes severe headaches though no hypertension , tachycardia frequently , some indications of mucous colitis , occasional rates in the lungs . Otherwise , no overt signs of disease . Well , Bob ? Want to examine the specimen ? " Robert silently opened his bag and removed his stethoscope and various other intruments . No doubt , he thought , the sorrowful old man was suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointment in them . His examination was thorough . Mr. Witherby flaccidly submitted to everything as if nothing meant any-  | thing any longer to him . Finally Robert put away his instruments and looked long and earnestly at the old gentleman , his kind young eyes full of pity . " No overt signs of disease , " he repeated . Jonathan moved restlessly . He was not a man to fidget but now it appeared to Robert that the was fidgeting . He went to the window , stared out , yawned . " When 's Priscilla due to arrive today ? " he asked . " Prissy ? " Mr. Witherby smiled his enchanting smile . " In an hour or two , I think . " Jonathan looked over his shoulder at Robert . " Priscilla , or Prissy , is old Jonas ' second wife . Thirty years old , or a little older . A luscious piece . " Mr. Withcrhy laughed in delight . " That she is , my boy , that she is ! " Robert stared . This made Jonathan chuckle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said to Robert , making a rude sound . Robert flushed . Mr. Withcrhy laughed again . " You must n't listen to our clear Jonathan , " he said , putting his little hand on Jonathan 's blue alpaca sleeve . " He loves to shock . You must really see Prissy . The Florodora Sextette are witches in comparison . There 's only one girl prettier in all Pennsylvania , " and now he smiled slyly at Jonathan , " and that 's Jennifer Heger whom Jonathan loves to call his niece . " Well , thought Robert , I suppose you ca n't blame the old gentleman . He has to have some happiness in his life . Jonathan said , " Priscilla was the town 's most expensive doxy . I assume you know what a doxy is , Bob ? " " Now , now , Jonathan , " said Mr. Witherby , not in the least offended . In fact , he laughed again . " Did n't David , in his old age , have a plump young maiden to sleep with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prissy has n't been a maiden since she was sixteen , if not younger . But a fastidious little bitch , always . Never slept with anyone for less than fifty dollars ; mostly more , " said Jonathan . " Look at Bob . He 's blushing again . " Robert stared at him helplessly . " Well , " said Jonathan , with considerable impatience . " Where 's that nose of yours ? Smell anything ? " " What a blackguard you are , " said Mr. Witherby , fondly , and watching Robert with renewed interest . " Here I am , an old man of as many afflictions as Job and Jonathan can do nothing but tease me . I came in here . after a collapse I thought you were trying to show Prissy that you still had it and almost dropped dead trying . Then I decided that Prissy had fed you a little something so she could slip out for some clean air . Come on , Jonas , what was it ? " " Oh , dear , " said Mr. Witherby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jonathan . You will give Dr. Morgan some very peculiar ideas about me . " His ancient yet angelic face beamed on the younger doctor . " I 've known Jonathan since he was born and he was always like this . Very startling and unpredictable and forever trying to shock others with the rudest language . But I know him ! A kinder heart never beat , a more gentle soul ? " " Shut up , " said Jonathan . " Do n't be such a sanctimonious scoundrel , Jonas . " He looked at Robert sharply , and frowned . " Well ? Where 's that nose ? " What in God 's name does he want me to say ? asked Robert with that new anger of his . He 's been insulting this gentle old man steadily , and his young wife  --  Robert lifted his head with a jerk . There were those middle-aged sons , one mad , one a drunkard ; there had been a wife , who had taken her life . Robert turned his eyes on Mr. Witherby and studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something and he said to himself , The stench of evil . He was horrified at the thought . Mr. Witherby , as he had done with Jonathan , put his hand on Robert 's arm and the muscles in that arm involuntarily stiffened . " Do I smell badly ? " asked Mr. Witherby , in a sweet and coaxing tone . " I was just bathed and powdered like a baby ! " Still clutching Robert 's arm he said to Jonathan , " You 've almost persuaded me to contribute to that tuberculosis ward for indigent children , dear boy , at the Friends ' . A little more of your refreshing conversation and I 'll give you my check . And wo n't stop payment on it ! " He laughed joyously . I must have been mistaken , thought Robert , and stood very still . It was my imagination , and Jonathan 's prompting , that made me smell corruption . " If you do give me that check , " said Jonathan , " it 'll be the first decent thing you ever did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go to Purgatory rather than to hell . But you do n't believe in either , do you ? " " Jonathan ! I 'm a Christian ! Ask the Reverend Mr. Wilson ? Oh , Jonathan , you are teasing me again . " Now they both looked at Robert . Robert said , " You have  --  you have , Mr. Witherby , some of the usual signs of advanced age ? " The old man actually paled and now he no longer smiled . " Do n't say that to him ! " Jonathan exclaimed . " If there 's one thing he hates it is the mere suggestion of mortality . Have n't you noticed that , in the wicked ? Call them any names you wish , murderers , liars , thieves , perjurers , traitors , sadists , and they 'll forgive you . But remind them that they are about to shuffle off and you 've made an enemy for life .  | And an enemy like old Jonas here is a very formidable thing . He has ways of reaching out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert heard himself saying , " But , Mr. Witherby , you are remarkably well-preserved , and with care should live  --  should live  --  a considerable time longer . " Mr. Witherby 's color returned . " I intend to do that , Doctor . Indeed . My parents lived far into their nineties . I love life , Doctor . I find it endlessly amusing , endlessly fascinating . I always have . You must n't listen to Jonathan , who could find thousands of flaws in a saint . I never had any need to injure anyone , for I inherited all my money and have increased it . I 've been unfortunate in my family . My poor first wife came of unstable forebears ; I was warned . My poor sons inherited her predisposition . Put there , I must n't burden you with my troubles . Jonathan , when can I leave here ? " " Today . When Prissy comes . That should brighten up her life when you tell her ! But , if I were you , I 'd buy a mongrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after this . " " Oh , Jonathan . You must n't say such crude things . " He giggled like a boy . " Prissy knows my will . I have an autopsy ordered . " Robert did not know if he was serious . He was bewildered again ; yet he retreated a step from the old man . " Good , " said Jonathan . " Though if I perform the autopsy and even find cyanide , I 'll say from natural causes . ' After all , Prissy 's had to stand you for three years . She deserves some consideration . Bob ? " " I 'd like to talk with you a moment , outside , " said Robert . " Why , why ? " cried Mr. Witherby , staring from one to the other . " Are you trying to hide something from me ? Is there something really wrong ? " He was nakedly terrified . " I only wish there were , " said Jonathan . " Sad to say , there is n't , though it 's still a mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warn Prissy not to be too hasty in the future . " He bowed derisively to the old man and followed Robert out of the room . They stood in the corridor . Robert said to him angrily , " I do n't know what all this is about ! " " And you did n't smell anything ? " Robert pressed his lips hard together . " It may be I am suggestible . I thought I ? " He stopped . " You smelled a stench ? " Robert moved his head with fresh anger . Jonathan said , " You were quite right , and I 'm pleased with you . Dee-lighted , as Teddy Roosevelt would say . That is the most contemptible and vicious monster you probably ever met in your life , and I doubt you 'll ever meet another as bad . I le drove his wife to her death , with his sweet malignance and malice , and he drove one son into madness and the other to the bottle .  | And I 'm willing to bet everything I have that never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them or threaten them or speak roughly to them . I bet he never did anything violent in his whole existence nor inspired open fear . Yet , he really frightened his wife to death , and so scared his sons that they ran away from him in the only ways they could . You see , soft and gentle characters are particularly susceptible to the presence of evil . But I 'm tough . I know all about him . " Robert looked involuntarily at the closed door . " You do n't believe in demonic possession , do you ? " asked Jonathan . " Well , I do . There may be many things I do n't believe , but I believe in a personal Satan , and old Witherby 's one of his best friends . Jonas never swore , to anyone 's knowledge ; the parsons love him . Children adore him , and so much for that business of children always know . ' That mass of flowers in there was n't sent by hypocrites but by people who really admire the old bastard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign against the evil eye , " and he smiled and held out his right hand , extended two fingers and thrust them downward . " My Catholic training . I had a superstitious nurse , too , when I was a kid . " He began to walk down the corridor and Robert had to follow him . Jonathan pushed his hands in his pockets again and bent his dark head . " It was something in you that made you smell something , and if a doctor ca n't smell evil then he is n't a doctor in the true sense . There were some houses old Dr. Bogus would n't enter for a handful of gold twentydollar pieces , and I know why . He was afraid . " " Of what ? " Robert was feeling more confidence and was ashamed of himself . " Of corruption . He told me , when he was a very o1 ( 1 man , that you can catch an illness from a diseased soul just as you can catch it from a diseased body . And it 's true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is . Stay away from corrupt people , and they 're more numerous than you think . " " Superstition , " said Robert . " A mentally ill person ? " " Do you think old Jonas is mentally ill ? " " Well . No . I do n't think so . But you never can tell . An alienist , perhaps ? I 've been reading some of Freud 's work ? " Jonathan laughed . " Freud ? That incestuous pervert ? Yes , he did commit incest , you know . Quite freely and with enjoyment . He projected his own perversions on the whole of humanity . Of course , he did light up , with his own hellish light , some pretty filthy corners and attics and cellars in other people , because he was familiar with those places in his own soul , too . But he was at a loss in the company of good people ; actually lost . He could n't accept virtue . He thought it hypocrisy , lies or hysteria . You 'd better look more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental illness , " Robert began , in a somewhat pompous tone . " Oh , we 'll explore it all right ! But there is something to the ancient snake pits , you know . They did cure people ; shock , they say . Perhaps . I think they just scared , literally , the hell out of them . A rough way of exorcism . " He grinned at Robert . Then someone exclaimed , " Oh , there you are , Jon ! " Robert turned and saw three young people approaching with smiles , and outstretched hands . One , he saw , was a plump young priest with a kind and boyish face . One was a pretty woman , fashionably dressed in a soft gray silk suit with a lace jabot at her throat and a severe sailor hat of straw on her pile of blond hair . The third was evidently hrr husband , a loose-jointed young fellow with a bush of auburn curls and large light eyes . For some reason Robert felt a sense of reprieve , or freshness , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and malodorous cave . He saw open faces , candid and honest , and a vivid youthfulness and sincerity and an actual childlike pleasure . " How are you , Father McNulty ? " said Jonathan , shaking hands briefly with the priest . " Beth , dear . Howard . " He indicated Robert . " My replacement , Dr. Morgan . Fresh as a daisy , is n't he , and I guarantee that he 's just as innocent , too . " Robert , newly annoyed , shook hands . " Beth and Howard Best , " said Jonathan . " Martha 's parents . " Robert was frightened . He looked from one smiling face to the other and he wanted to run away . But Jonathan had firmly gripped his arm . " Let 's go to the waiting room down the corridor , " said Jonathan . " I 've just seen Martha . I want to tell you about her . " They all went with him , chattering serenely , and Robert thought of the dying child who was waiting for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha , and Howard says I 'm ridiculous . I am , are n't I , Jon ? When can we take her home ? " She smiled back at Robert shyly . " I hope you 'll like Hambledon , Doctor . Such a nice town and we 're right up-to-date ; I heard you were from Philadelphia . We 'll make you welcome , you 'll see ! But do try to make dear Jon stay , wo n't you ? We simply ca n't let him go ! We love him so much ! " Phis dumfounded Robert . The priest slowed down to walk beside him and he was looking at Robert with curiosity . " From Philadelphia , eh ? I was a curate there . Not for long , thank God , and I mean that , Doctor . " Ile laughed . His laughter was rich and friendly . " The old Father was a Tartar . But fledgling priests have to expect that . Soften us up , take the pomposity out of us , strip us down to the shivering hide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anyone agreeable enough to pick us up and dust us off and take us home . " His mother was right , thought Robert . The Papist clergy were full of levity . Then he was embarrassed at his thought . Father McNulty was hardly older than himself . How did one address a priest ? He could n't say " Father . " What did the Bible say about that ? " Call no one your father except Him Who is in Heaven , " or something like that . Robert was confused . He said , " Well , sir , I suppose every profession has its drawbacks , " and felt like a fool . The young priest only smiled with the utmost friendliness . He had a face like an apple , with a double chin and light smooth hair and a dimple in his right cheek ; his eyes were warm gold . The waiting room was empty and full of sun and comfortable modern furniture , and Beth sat down and took off her gloves and kept her eyes affectionately on Jonathan , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she exclaimed . " Is n't it a lovely day ! Howard , you absolutely must not light that smelly pipe ! Not in a hospital . We just ran into Father McNulty , " she said to Jonathan . " He was coming to see Martha , too . Is n't that nice ? " Her pretty face was artless and flushed with sun and fair as a rose . " My pipe does n't smell , " said Howard Best . He patted his wife 's shoulder . " It 's better than those coffin nails Jonathan smokes and warns everybody not to put in their own mouths . Well , Jon , when can we take our girl home ? " " Just as soon as her fever goes down , " said Jonathan . He was rubbing the thick gold chain that spanned his middle . He looked at the priest . " I 'm glad you 're here , " he said . Howard Best slowly took the unlit pipe from his mouth . " What ? Is there anything wrong  --  with Martha ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Martha ? Martha ? " In the mysterious way of the clergy Father McNulty understood . He saw Jonathan 's grave face , the wide cheekbones which were now stark , the evasive eyes . He said to Mrs. Best , " Now , Beth . Let 's hear what Jonathan has to say . " " There 's nothing wrong with my girl ? " asked Howard Best in a changed voice . " Why , old Louis Hedler said it was anemia ? " " Martha ! " cried Beth , in the ancient tones of a frightened mother , and the priest reached out and took her hand and held it firmly . Robert stood at a distance and again wanted to run and knew he must stay , even though no one noticed him now . " In a way , " said Jonathan in a gentle voice , " it is , indeed , anemia.  | I took a blood test this morning . I do n't know why it was n't done before . " " So ? " said Howard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? " " Oh , no , it ca n't be serious ! " said Beth in a voice like a prayer . " Not our sweet little girl ! " " It is best to be euphemious with a patient , or his relatives , " Robert had been taught . " One must Inspire Hope . " Perhaps , he thought , wretchedly . He , himself , had seen practically moribund patients suddenly brighten and almost miraculously recover ; he had seen deathbeds quicken into life . I le had seen dying men open their eyes and live . But there had never been a case of acute leukemia  --  that most rare , that almost unknown and mysterious disease  --  that had recovered . The White Sickness of the Greeks , the silent ghost that struck a mortal blow and never repented . It was a lie , and a cruel one , to give hope where there was no hope . Jonathan said , looking into Beth 's widened eyes , " Martha has acute leukemia , Beth . " The parents visibly relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the priest , it was evident . Now they were hopefully puzzled . " What 's that ? " asked Howard . " One of your new diseases , which your microscopes just discovered ? " " No . It 's very old . But very rare . " Jonathan hesitated . " And there 's no cure . " One of Beth 's hands flew to her mouth . " You mean , " she whispered , " like consumption ? " " Beth , dear , " said Jonathan , " we can cure tuberculosis now . Sometimes . I wish to God it was only that . Acute leukemia  --  it ca n't be cured . " " Do you mean she 'll have it all her life , like the effects of infantile paralysis ? " asked Howard , sitting down with new stiffness as if he were afraid he would break . " How do we deal with it ? Special tonics ? Seaside ? Mountains ? " He paused . " What the hell is it , anyway ? " and his voice rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tighter . Jonathan said , " I 'd rather have it myself , I swear to God , than to tell you this , 1 Toward . You see , there 's nothing anyone can do . We call it , roughly speaking , cancer of the blood-making organs . " " Cancer ! " streamed Beth , and now she frantically pulled away from the priest and jumped to her feet . Her face was terrible . " I do n't believe it , I do n't believe it ! Children do n't get cancer ! It 's just old people ! Martha does n't have cancer ! I wo n't believe it  --  it 's wrong , it 's cruel , of you , Jon ! Cruel , cruel , cruel , to say such a thing ! "  | " But true , " he said , almost inaudibly . Howard stood up and caught his trembling wife to him and she hid her face on his shoulder and shook her head over and over in utter denial , and groaned , " God , God , God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you call it ? " said Howard , holding his wife tightly . " Blood ? Cancer ? Tumor ? Why , Martha has no tumors - it-  " He looked helplessly at the priest , and his young face was ghastly . " It must be a mistake , " he said . " Cancer ! Martha ! It 's unheard of , in children . " " No , it is n't , " said Jonathan , and he stood up also and moved nearer the agonized young couple . " Doctors just do n't speak of it , that 's all . You see , it is getting much more common now . I 've seen eight other cases like Martha 's , Howard . Just eight . And they all ? " " Died , " said Howard and there was no expression in his voice . " Died , " said Jonathan . Howard held his wife even more tightly . He looked at Jonathan as one who looks at an executioner , with instinctive hatred and despair . " How long ? " he whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honestly do n't know . Perhaps a few days , perhaps a few weeks , or months . But not more than a year , not more than a year , and only that if she has a temporary remission . " " I do n't believe you ! " Howard exclaimed . " Old Louis Heller would 've told us ! He said it was just anemia ! He saw her last night ! He 'd know if it was  --  if it was ? " " Howard , " said the priest , and put his hand on the young man 's shoulder . But Howard gave him a blind , impersonal glare and shook off that hand . He was panting . Beth had become stiff and still in his arms , and cringing . " I 'll call decent doctors , doctors with experience in this thing , doctors who know ! " Howard shouted . " Not young quacks , not a man who ? " " Howard ! " said the priest with authority . " I do n't care ! " shouted the frenzied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know why , but he 's lying ! He wants to  --  I do n't believe him ! We 'll take Martha away  --  to Philadelphia , to competent  --  one of those clinics ? He lies ! " He was out of breath . " He 's a rotten ? " " Howard ! " said the priest , but again Howard shook him off . He pressed his cheek against his wife 's . " Do n't cry , darling , do n't cry . It 's all lies . Martha 's all right . She must n't see you like this . We 'll take Martha home , today . We 'll take her to ? " Now his eyes swelled with tears of agony and he looked at Jonathan with the utmost ferocity and loathing . " How you could say such a thing ! To a mother and a father ! "  | " I wish to God it was I , " said Jonathan . " I 'd give my life , Howard . But it 's true . You must n't hope . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , no , " said Beth , with her lips against her husband 's neck . " It 's not true . Not Martha . It 's just an infection  --  a bad cold . Martha was never sick a day in her life . " Jonathan sighed . For the first time he saw Robert . Then he said to the priest , " Father , you must n't let them hope . There 's no hope . Just help them , that 's all , if you can . " Howard almost screamed , " He 's a murderer , and everybody knows it ! That 's why he said that ? 1 He wants other people to die , tool He probably makes them ( licl He ? " He strangled . " I 'll kill him , " he gasped . " I 'll surely kill him ! " The priest said to Jonathan , " Do n't mind , Jon . He does n't know what he 's saying , in his pain . Do n't mind . You do n't , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonathan . " I mind like hell . Did you expect me not to ? " " Poor Jon , " said the priest . The big pretty room , shining with windows and sun , suddenly appeared horrible to Robert . He heard distant laughter in the corridor and , outside , the crunching of wheels over gravel and the sound of lawn mowers and the call of birds . So beautiful and peaceful , so full of life : He could not bear it . A child was dying , and no one cared out there , and no one knew , and when she was dead it would all go on . " There 's nothing ? " the priest was saying . " Nothing , " said Jonathan , and he walked slowly from the room and Robert followed him . Outside in the corridor Jonathan leaned against the wall as if exhausted , and he said in a venomous voice , " Christ . " In the waiting room Howard was incoherently shouting and the priest 's voice was low but persistent , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I can see now , why you must go away . It 's bad enough , having to tell them , but this . " He stopped eloquently . " Christ , " said Jonathan again , as if he had not heard . He lifted himself away from the wall and walked away . After a moment Robert followed . " We love him so much , " Beth had said . Robert wanted to hit something with all his strength . Jonathan said , " That little kid . " He seemed to be speaking only to himself . " And old Witlicrby . There 's no sense to it , no sense to anything . "  | In moments Jonathan 's bitter face had smoothed itself and he was opening another door and saying , " Hello , Mrs. Winters . How are we today ? " An elderly woman , very thin and with scanty white hair , was sitting high on pillows in a room that seemed oddly barren and deserted to Robert  --  who was still shaken  --  even if it was filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as if no one was really here at all and had never been here and the old woman was merely a shadow . And a shadow did she appear , with her pallor and her cyanosed lips and pale strained eyes . But she smiled happily at Jonathan and when he took her dry hand she pulled him down to her and kissed his cheek like a mother . " My dear boy , " she said . Her voice was low and whispering , and there was a faint pulsing in her throat . But her eyes were shrewd and intelligent . " What 's the matter , dear ? " she asked . " Has something hurt you ? " " Nothing more than usual , " he said . " Now , do n't you worry about me . How did you sleep last night ? " He took up her chart and studied it closely . " Wonderful , " she said . She looked with mild but polite curiosity at Robert . She had a fine worn face , aristocratic and controlled , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chart . " This is young Dr. Morgan , Mrs. Winters . My replacement . Robert , this is Elizabeth Winters , my favorite patient , and a saint . " " He talks nonsense , " said Mrs. Winters , holding out her hand to Robert . He took the slight old hand ; it was very cold though the room was hot . " We 're not going to let him go , are we , Dr. Morgan ? " Heart failure , thought Robert . The old lady had an indomitable appearance , he saw now , and a strong spirit . There was a small bottle of digitalis on her bedside table . It was very strange , but the room did feel empty as if she were already dead . What had she said ? " We 're not going to let him go , are we ? " Jonathan put down the chart and came to the bedside again . " Breathing better ? " he asked . " Much better , thanks to you , Jon . I 'm sure I feel better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest doubt . You could n't feel worse . " It was an effort for her to laugh , but she did . However , she studied Jon . " If you leave me , I 'll die on somebody 's hands . " After a moment she added , " I hope so . Jon , why do you insist on keeping this old body alive ? I keep fighting you . " She paused to get her breath . " You 're just perverse . " " Of course I am . I like to see people keeping on living . Besides , we  | do n't have many good people in the world , and when we lose one we 're that much poorer . That 's why I want you to live . " " For what ? " Now her voice had become a whisper again . Her exhausted eyes looked up at him with unaffected simplicity . " For me . Let 's say that . " He nodded at Robert , who opened his bag . " Dr. Morgan is going to examine you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how to keep a good soul alive as long as possible . " " He 's so young , " she said , and with affection . Her breathing was more difficult . Robert examined her with his stethoscope and knew almost at once that she was dying . She had tachycardia and arrhythmias , slurred heart sounds , sudden galloping rhythms , and her lungs were full of rates , sibilant and scattered . Acute left heart failure ; it would not be long before her right heart failed also . Robert looked at the digitalis thoughtfully . " Well , " said Jonathan , " why do you suppose I prescribed that ? Be frank . Mrs. Winters is an intelligent woman and you ca n't frighten her . " " You gave it because of rapid auricular fibrillation , " said Robert , after hesitation . ( " Never discuss a patient in his presence , even with another physician , " he had been taught . ) " Correct , " said Jonathan . " Sedatives ? Diuretics ? " said Robert . " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to suggest , Doctor ? " Robert again hesitated . He thought , I 'd like to give her hope . " No , " he said . Jonathan smiled . He looked at the flowers . " Thank you for them , Jon , " said Mrs. Winters . She coughed , and put her handkerchief to her mouth , and wheezed for breath . But after the spasm she said , " I know . There was n't any card . But who would send them , except you , dear ? " " Lots of people . The nurses love you . " She was so spent that she only moved her head in faintly smiling denial on her pillows . Again Jon bent and kissed her cheek . " Keep alive , " he said . " I need you . " He added , " My mother is coming in to see you this afternoon . " " Sweet Marjorie , " said Mrs. Winters , and closed her eyes . Jonathan kit the room and Robert followed him . They stood near the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " That 's the classic example of how not to treat your children . " " She does n't want to live , does she ? " " No , she does n't . And hope , in congestive heart failure , is the most potent drug . She has n't any . What was I saying ? Mrs. Winters is another of the ' old settlers . ' She 's a widow . She was attached to her  | husband , in a way , but her whole life was centered on two daughters and one son . She inherited a fortune from her parents and another from her husband . Now she does n't have a cent . " " What did she do with it ? " " She did n't spend it on riotous living ! She let her daughters and her son persuade her to turn her money over to them . They 'd take the most wonderful care of dear Mama ; Mama was too unsophisticated to manage by herself ; dear Mama 's sweet head must n't be bothered by all those nasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let lovely Bertha and Grace and Sonny Jim take care of all matters and deal with those old lawyers and banks and other ugly things . Mama Deserved to Enjoy Life now Her Family was Grown . " Jonathan 's voice had taken on the viciousness Robert had heard so often before . " Well , dear Mama listened to all those cooing and loving voices , those dear and darling voices of her children . They were married ; the daughters live in Philadelphia and Sonny Jim , when he got his dirty hands on all that cash , moved on to New York . Oh , they do n't let her starve ! She has a single bedroom in the very hotel where you 're staying just now , and they pay her medical bills and remember her with a littlemodest  --  gift at Christmas and sometimes , when they 're not too busy spending her money , they send her a birthday card . Sometimes . And once a year they all write her a brief note . They 're so busy , you see . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years ago . They 've had children since then . Six grandchildren . She 's seen only one , and he was a baby and now he 's at Princeton . She never saw the others . They did n't encourage her to visit . Mama was too frail , they said . And they never came back to Hambledon . Why should they ? They have what they had set out to get . Right from the moment their father died . She has n't even a photograph of her grandchildren . " She knows . She 's not a mawkish fool . She does n't save the cards and the infrequent letters they send her  --  when they remember she 's still alive , which they regret . She did have a photograph of the three greedy and accursed devils . Up to about five years ago . Then she destroyed it . When people ask her if she has children , she says no : She really does n't . In fact , she never did . She gave them too much of her love , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She gave them her life . So naturally , they took everything and returned nothing . And she knows . She also knows it is entirely her own fault , and she does n't blame them . She did it to herself . She understands that if she had kept her money they 'd be rushing around her all the time and smothering her with affection .  | " And she does n't want that affection . She does n't want bought kisses and bought remembrances and lying , loving letters . If she ca n't have the real article she does n't want anything else . In a way , it 's a relief to her that she is n't fooled any longer . If she blames anyone it is herself  --  not for giving them the money but because she wasted her life , and wasted her husband 's life . What she gave him  --  the remnants left over after she had given most of the cloth to her children  --  was n't enough , and now she mourns for her husband and wants to hurry off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blindness and selfishness . " " Tragic , " said Robert , much depressed . He thought of his mother , who kept a hard closed hand on her purse and he said to himself , Good for you , old girl . " The most tragic thing in life is not losing those you care for most , or suffering loss or pain . It 's making a damned fool out of yourself ? when it was n't necessary . That 's the hardest thing to bear . " He looked at Robert and smiled a little . " That 's what I did . And I 'm paying for it . " " I wonder , " said Robert , the young and now depressed , " if I should ask my mother to visit Mrs. Winters . She does love the old settlers , ' you know . And she 's great on what she calls visiting the sick , ' provided it does n't cost more than a few flowers or a scented handkerchief or a pot of calves ' foot jelly . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother yet but I 've a good idea of what 's she like . She 'd probably tell Mrs. Winters that she 's been a fool , and she 'd be quite right . But telling a person that she 's been a fool only brings the fact closer to home , and it 's not calculated to do the patient any good . " " She 's determined to die , " said Robert . " So she is . And as for me , I 'll be glad to be the one to close her eyes and wish her Godspeed . I 've a standing order to be called when she 's in extremis . Someone has to be on hand when the boat unfurls its sail , and cheer from the dock . She 'll like that . " A child who was dying and who should live ; an old wicked man who was not dying and wished to live ; an old abandoned mother who wanted to die . As Jonathan had said , " There 's no sense to anything . " In the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was slightly more successful with the last . When he went out into the sunshine he felt he had become quite aged . He felt very old and worn , and used up . He was not as yet able to be objective . This afternoon he had to watch three operations , none of which was Jonathan 's . He watched Jonathan walk rapidly away and he said to himself , A most ambiguous man .  | Four nights later , almost at midnight , Father Francis McNulty came to see Jonathan Ferrier . The lights in the big house were out , but the lights in the office were brightly shining . The moon was icy and glittering for again the weather had turned cold . The priest went to the offices , knocked and entered . He found Jonathan sprawled in a chair , more than slightly drunk , with a bottle of whiskey on the spattered desk before him . So that 's it , thought the young priest sadly , but made himself smile with a glow of his golden eyes . " Surprised to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how inane that was . Jonathan , who had long ago removed his collar and tie and was now in shirtsleeves , had a rumpled and disheveled appearance . He scowled drowsily ; his eyes were bloodshot . " Trust the devil to turn up when least expected , " he said . He waved at the bottle . " Have a drink . There 's an extra glass . " " I think I will , " said the priest . He sat down . He tried to keep the dismay out of his voice , and his pity . He poured some whiskey into the glass and drank it slowly , attempting to keep Jonathan from seeing his consternation . But Jonathan was not looking at him . He was yawning heavily and glumly . He reached for the bottle . " Not just yet , Jon , " said the priest . " I want to talk to you . " " At this hour of the night ? " Jonathan looked blearily at his watch , then snapped the case shut , fumbled for the pocket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where 've you been ? Carousing ? " He put the bottle down . He tried to focus his eyes . " What 's up ? " he asked . " Somebody died , thank God ? " " Yes . " " Congratulations . " " Do n't be childish , Jon ? " " If you 're going to set up a Confessional here , Frank , you can get the hell out . I 'm not up to listening to some sad tale . " His voice was slurred and sluggish . " Nor are you listening to mine . " He became a little excited and his drunkenness appeared to increase . " Was n't it you who asked me last December , over and over , if I was guilty ' ? Yes , I 've not forgotten , you know . " " I only did my duty , Jon , and you know it . There was always the danger ? " " Of me hanging , in mortal sin . Now , why do n't you go home and say your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't believe you killed Mavis ? " " Well , not after I 'd finally convinced you . In the beginning , yes . " The priest was silent . He said a private mental prayer . He said , " I want you to forgive somebody . I 'd like to tell him  --  her  --  tonight , that you did . " Jonathan forced himself upright , and groaned and snatched at his head . " Who , for God 's sake ? And why ? And what do I care ? Do you mean some pigs have actually become convinced I did n't kill Mavis and have sent you here , at this hour ? Ca n't they fry a little in their consciences until tomorrow ? " " They 're waiting to hear , Jon . Right now . By telephone . It is bad enough for them just nw . It 's worse , thinking of you . " " Fine . I.ct them fry . Tell them ' no . ' " Now he did pour more whiskey for himself and gulped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " little Martha Best died three hours ago , at the hospital . " Jonathan lifted his heavy arms , let them drop on the desk , then dropped his head upon them . He did n't really hear , thought the priest , with compassion . He 's fallen asleep . He looked at Jonathan 's slack head , at the dark disordered hair , at the side of the sallow cheek , which was as still as wood . Then Jonathan said in a voice that seemed to come from a long way off , " I did n't know . I have n't seen her for four days . They 'd given orders , the Bests , and old swinish Louis Hedler , that I was n't to go near her . Had n't I done enough , ' lying to them , scaring them to death , trying to make them suffer ? That 's what they said . Even her nurses were forbidden to tell me anything about her . " " Yes . I know , Jon . I know . But after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , ' Can he possibly forgive us ? ' I said I did n't know . And they asked me to come now , not tomorrow . They ca n't bear waiting . They 've got to know . " " At this time , when Martha 's just died ? They can think of that now ? " 1Iv lifted his head and his face was changed and distorted . " What 's the matter with them ? " ' They knew this morning that she was dying . It was obvious . But you were n't in the hospital then . They looked for you . " Jonathan wet his dried and swollen lips . His eyes seemed full of blood . it seems you 've got a Mass of the Angels to celebrate . " " Jonathan , please . " Jonathan said . " Ilo n't talk like that to me , in that pained tone of voice ! As for Martha , she 's well out of it . What does anyone have to live four ? " " You 0do n't know what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest in an ugly fashion . " Let them get their consolations from that old fraud , Louis . " The priest stood up , sighing . " So , you wo n't forgive them ? " He waited . But Jonathan said nothing . However , in a moment he did speak . " I 'm to be the saint , am I , forgiving every son of a bitch who digs into my bowels and turns the knife ? Why ? Just tell me why . " " Because , Jon , though you 've turned away you are still a Christian . And , I hope , a man . " Jonathan laughed . " Words , words . " He waved heavily at the telephone . " All right . Tell them . Tell them that I grovel before them and beg their forgiveness ? " He stopped . " Hell . Tell them that my heart is broken for them , and then get the hell out of here . " The priest reached for the telephone and took the receiver from its hook . Marjorie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small and private sitting room on the second floor of the great old house . Here no one came except by her invitation . She would quote , without apology , " ' In solitude , when we are least alone . ' " Jonathan understood this , but Harald would remark , in the new jargon , " It is really selfishness and an indifference to others . " He had made this remark , regrettably , to Jonathan , who had snorted , " ' I to myself am dearer than a friend . ' Shakespeare . A man never betrays himself , unless he is a fool or a saint , and what 's the difference ? Mother ca n't really stand people , which shows that she is a very wise woman , indeed . " The soft June rain was falling again , but as it was warm Marjorie 's casement windows were open to the air and the piercing scent of roses blew into the cozy little room . She was knitting serenely ; she made many woolen garments each year for her sons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he had refused the tea which stood on the low marble table near his mother . He did not like this small room , with the white paneled walls , the ruffled voile curtains , the rose-colored rug and the delicate mahogany furniture . It reminded him too keenly of the times Marjorie had brought him here as a child to speak to him quietly and firmly after some transgression . It had made him cringe , for she had known him only too well . He preferred his father 's infrequent cuffings ; at least the old boy did n't understand his children and that had been a blessing . Harald looked at his mother , at her aloof face , her patrician features , her smooth duck skirt and her severe white-silk shirtwaist . She wore a brown belt about her narrow waist ; her clever hands flashed with needles and with her engagement ring . The long lashes of her hazel  | eyes , so like Harald 's , fluttered duskily on her pale cheek . Her dark head was slightly bent . She might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , as I 've told you before , I 've asked Jenny to come here and live with me . She refuses . " " I know . Well , the island was her father 's dream and delight . " He spoke with light bitterness . " She has a passion about it . She thinks I 'm a dastardly intruder . " He smiled . " I hate the damned pretentious place , and she knows it , and she knows that I do n't dare stay away from it more than five months out of a year . I bet she counts each day ! More than five months , even a couple of hours ? " He moved his finger across his throat in a slicing gesture . " It was a silly will , " said Marjorie . Now she looked at her son . " Jenny believes you overheard her mother say to Jenny , just before she died , that she was about to make a new will . " 1 Iarald hesitated . Ile took another gloomy sip from his glass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I did n't know that she knew I 'd overheard . I was glad , Mother . I knew the terms of Myrtle 's old will . I hated them . I thought perhaps she 'd come to her senses , after my long arguments with her . So Jenny knew I 'd heard , eh ? What did she tell you ? " But his mother was regarding him with an intense if secret expression . " She only mentioned it , Harald . She , too , thought it was a stupid will , and unfair  --  to her . " " Well , it was . Myrtle ought to have divided the money equally between us . I could have left then , kissing Hambledon goodbye forever , and Jenny could have had her damned island all alone and live like the recluse she really is . " Marjorie was still watching him . Harald did not hear her faint sigh . He was pouring a little more brandy into his glass . He was the more handsome of Marjorie 's sons , as everyone was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I 've wanted Jenny to marry me , Mother . " " Yes , dear . She told me . " " It 's not the money , Mother . After all , what does she have until I die , or something ? One hundred wretched dollars a month . I love Jenny ; I want her . " " Yes , " said Marjorie . She paused . " Who do you think is spreading nasty talcs about you and Jenny , Harald ? " He did nut answer for a moment , and Marjorie became a little sick . Why , Harald , she said to herself . You did ! You want to force Jenny to make her position there with you less scandalous ! Oh , Harald , you were always a devious little boy ! But this is dreadful . She felt very ill. " 1 do n't know , " said Harald .  | " But everyone believes them . " He shrugged . " More fools they . How could anyone believe anything disgusting about poor Jenny ? She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jon believes those stories , Harald . " " Oh , Jon . He always believes the worst of everybody . He always did . " He smiled at her winningly . " When we were kids he never asked who broke something of his . He took it for granted that I did , and hit first and asked questions afterward . Not that he was invariably wrong . I did like to tease him ; he was so solemn most of the time . " Marjorie let the knitting fall to her knees . " Jon was a relentless little boy , dear . To him things were either totally black or totally white . He never saw the gray places . There was a kind of fierceness about him . He could never compromise . Once betrayed , he never forgave . Now you ? " " I live in the gray places . Like you , Mother . Like everybody who 's sensible . " " Yes . " He smiled at her affectionately . " If he were a fool I could understand . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could forgive and forget . My father always preferred him , though , even if the old boy was more tolerant and understanding . He 'd sometimes forget I was alive . It was Jon this , and Jon that . My son , Jonathan . ' " Harald still smiled but the smile had subtly changed . " My father never took me seriously . " " Perhaps not , Harald . Your father was a very serious man , himself . " Harald yawned elaborately . " I know . He was always quoting Thomas a Kempis : Everywhere I have sought rest and found it not except sitting apart in a nook with a little book . ' He and his little nooks ! ' He 'd pull Jon into them with him for hours . Perhaps that is what is wrong with my glum-faced brother . " Marjorie 's hands were very still on her fallen knitting . " Let 's not belittle Jon 's troubles . After all , there was Mavis , and the  --  the ? " Harald looked thoughtfully at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beginning to tinge the raining sky . " He never knew anything about Mavis at all . He 'd known her almost from the moment she had been born . But he never saw her in reality . I did . She was shallow and stupid and plotting and frivolous and sly . You know that , Mother . You never said anything but I know you could n't endure him marrying her . However , there 's something to be said in Mavis ' defense , too . Jon had set up an impossible standard for her . She was suddenly to acquire intelligence and patience and devotion , and she could n't do it . She 'd lived for Mavis Eaton all her life and now she was expected to live for Jon and his interests ! She was to acquire a taste  | for book ? and science and for that boring hackneyed art he loves , the preRaphaelites . She was to grow four inches taller , at least , metaphorically speaking . But all the time she only wanted to dance , gossip , discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have a good time generally . If Jon had his complaints , Mavis had them , too , and I think I pitied her the most . Butterflies have to live , too , as well as granite busts . " But Marjorie said , " The town wo n't forget . In spite of all that Jon has done for it , and his really ferocious care for the sick and his hatred for pain and his devotion , it wo n't forget . They never say anything , but they still think he killed Mavis . " " They want to believe it , Mother . People always want to believe the Ivor . ' of others . " Oh , God , Marjorie prayed in herself , please stop me ! But she said , " You never believed it for a moment , did you , Harald ? " " Not for a moment ! Do n't I know Jon ? I did n't need those medical witnesses from Pittsburgh to tell me ! Jon 's word was enough . " He hesitated . Marjorie took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would see the trembling of her hands . " Please pour me some fresh tea , clear . " She watched Harald 's deft gestures as if all her life depended on his smallest movement . " Cream , again ? Sugar ? Well , here you are . You did n't drink the first cup . " " Thank you , Harald . Harald , all those months in prison , for Jon ! Oh , it 's gone and past and the past is better buried ! But it wo n't stay buried for Jon . People still drag out the corpse for him . He thinks I do n't know , but I do . He often spends the night out in the offices , drinking ? " " Jon ? " Harald stared . He frowned . Does he really care ? Marjorie asked herself . " Ile thinks I do n't know . And I know something else . When the little Best girl died he was inconsolable , for all his surface cynicism . And I heard that her parents rejected his diagnosis , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurses , and some doctors , had heard ' , nor I Toward Best 's ravings and threats , when Jon told them . ISut he was right , and the poor little thing died soon after . Sometimes I ca n't sleep , Harald . So I know that Father McNulty went to see Jon in his offices , the night of the death . I do n't exactly know why . But Ion would n't go to the funeral . I 've heard he wo n't speak to Howard , or Beth . Two weeks ago . He really loved that little girl ; he loves children . It 's very strange , is n't it ? " 1 Lu.dd had been listening with deep interest . He said , " I do n't  | think it 's strange . I do n't blame Jon . I thought they were among his best friends and had always stood by him . " " What is a best friend , ' Harald ? Sometimes I do n't know . I never completely trusted anybody . We are truly alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expecting the best from people , or at least decent human behavior . Howard had visited him in prison , and it was Howard who found good lawyers for him and always fought furiously with anyone who said Jon was guilty . Then this . " She put down her teacup . " If Jon had any doubts about leaving Hambledon he has n't any now . I hope he hurries . I hope he leaves soon ! " And so do I , thought Harald . He ca n't go soon enough for me . He reached out and patted his mother 's hand . " Darling , do n't be so upset . It 's been a miserable time for everybody . It 's over . People will forget . Jon will set up practice in a better place . " " Jon wo n't forget , Harald . He wo n't forget those months , and the trial . " She picked up her knitting , though the dusk in the room had become almost opaque . " No , dear . I can knit without a lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid he might  --  he might ? " " Oh , he was always violent . What truth ' ? Some hack injured Mavis , and then when she began to be infected from the injury she went to her darling uncle , old Eaton , and he rushed her to the hospital and tried to save her life with an operation . But it was too late . That 's what he testified in court , was n't it ? It all happened when Jon was in Pittsburgh . If old Eaton still believes that Jon bungled , or something , and then sent her to him , no one can change his opinion . Everybody wants to believe what he wants to believe . Including Jon . " Please stop me , Marjorie prayed . She said , " Everyone knew that Jon wanted children . He would n't have performed such an operation on Mavis . " The silence was suddenly intense in the room . Then Harald said , too softly , " Unless he wanted to kill her . " He waited . His mother said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . " But I do n't believe that , " said Harald . " We know the truth . He was not in Hambledon for five days . It all happened when he was away . " " Yes , " said Marjorie . She thought she was going to faint . Her heart was thumping erratically and there was sweat on her calm forehead . " That is why he was acquitted . The medical testimony even from Dr. Eaton , Martin . And Jon 's witnesses . It was impossible . " " How did we get on this gloomy subject ? " Harald now stood up as if the dusk were too much for him . He struck a match and lit a lamp . He stood in his tall and elegant handsomeness and stared at the lamp  | for a long time . " We 've gone over this so many times . You must n't be so morbid , Mother . I thought it was agreed that no one must mention this again . " " Yes , dear . " She looked at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back with little Martha 's death . It keeps coming back . And Jon 's drinking . He was usually moderate . Harald , I 'm afraid for him . He is the desperate kind . " " Oh , come . You do n't think he 'd kill himself , do you ? " Harald laughed . " I do n't know . If the worst conies to the worst , the truth will have to come out . " l i:u : ld slowly turned and looked at his mother . " What truth , Mother ? The name of the hack who botched the job . " Harald . Before Mavis was taken to the hospital she told me Jon had  --  had  --  done that thing to her . " I larald 's color diminished . " I ca n't believe that ! " " She told me , Harald . That was even before she went to see her uncle . I knew she was sick  --  and then she told me . " " But that 's impossible ! Jon was n't even here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her uncle . " " She lied , " said Harald . " Mavis was always a liar . " " I know . But that 's what she told me , and her uncle . " " If so , why did n't old Martin so testify ? " " I 've thought about it . Was he trying to protect Jon , even if he hated him after all that ? You know how doctors stand together . But I did read that he protested when the verdict of acquittal came in . " Harald still stared at his mother . Then he said with quiet violence , " I hope to God you have n't told anyone else about this ! " She raised her large hazel eyes to the eyes so like her own . " No , dear . T have n't told anyone . And , if I should hear it rumored about , Harald , I 'll know where it comes from . " Mother and son regarded each other without moving . Then Harald said , " It wo n't come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look at me like that ? " " Becalm. , dear , I know that you hate Jon . I 've known that for years . You disliked each other when you were children . I blame your father a lot for that . I larald , if things get worse ? " " ' They wo n't . " Ile spoke reassuringly and with quickness . " Let the dead bury the dead . " " But the dead often wo n't stay dead . " She stood up . She was very tall and thin and straight and she looked  | at her son intensely . " Harald . Do n't try to force Jenny to marry you . I know you love her . But do n't make life too intolerable for her . She does n't want you , Harald . " He felt threat in the room . He said with lightness , " How can I force Jenny to marry me , Mother ? These are n't medieval days . " " Harald , you must n't force her . She is n't as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . You must n't force her . " The feeling of threat increased . Harald moved a step backward from his mother . He said , " If jenny ever marries me it 'll be her decision . I promise you that . " " Yes , dear , " she said , and wanted to weep . " Yes , dear . " She put her arms about him and it was as if she held , again , her very vulnerable little boy , the little boy who had always laughed when he was hurt . But she had loved Jon the most .. How could she forgive herself ? " Well , I really do n't know , Robert , " said Jane Morgan in her usually discontented voice . " The rooms are n't very elaborate . " " But Mother , they are excellently proportioned , and the house is n't that old . " " I thought we 'd live elegantly , and up to our station . " " We have n't any yet  --  here . " " Oh , dear Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town ! " " It is n't wretched , and you 've liked the ladies you have already met and you told me , yourself , that they were very civil : Most of them have Main Line relatives in Philadelphia , " and Robert added to himself , Whom you do n't know and would love to . He stood with his mother in the parlor of the really attractive Georgian house , and , as he had said  --  prompted by Jonathan Ferrier  --  the rooms were excellently proportioned , with high molded ceilings , fine balanced doors , white marble fireplaces and beautiful bright wood floors . Robert resembled a redgold bear more emphatically , and stubbornly , each day . " And the lawns , " he said , " magnificant old elms , hickories , oaks , and a view of the river from the morning room and bedroom windows . You wo n't find any better in Philadelphia at the price . " Jane Morgan , leaning on her canes , again studied the big room with discontent , her widow 's weeds heavy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap set firmly on her hair in defiance of " modern ways . " Her long thin nose twitched ; her hard mouth moved with pettish but unspoken thoughts . Her small gray eyes slipped coldly over the sunshadowed walls , looking for faults and cracks . " I ca n't say , " she said , " that this is a soffiscated town . " " You mean sophisticated , ' Mother . "  | " Robert ! I 'm growing very weary of your impertinent remarks about my use of the Queen 's English ! " " It 's King 's English now , Mother , remember ? King Edward . " The cold little eyes studied him . " You were never like this in Philadelphia ! Something has happened to you here  --  probably that dreadful Ferrier man . I knew I would n't like him , and since I 've met him my opinions have been confirmed . What a repulsive creature ! Have n't you noticed how those thick white ridges spring out around his mouth for no reason at all ? " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually is , I admit . " " Bad temper , that 's all . Bad blood . I 've been hearing a number of things , " and she nodded significantly and tapped her canes on the bare wooden floor . " I suppose you have . I Iami , icdon 's as bad as Philadelphia for gossip . Now , Mother . We must decide . This house , you can see , is n't far from the Ferricrs , and it is very close to the offices I will be renting . I like it ; it is cheaper than the other houses you 've seen and we are lucky . It would be much higher priced if the lawyers were n't anxious to close an estate . " " I visualized a more sumptuous home . I ca n't say I like this home ? " " Mother . " Robert was weary . " This is n't a home ' yet ; we do n't live here , yet . So , it is still a house . " " Home , " repeated Mrs. Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed by the house but it was not in her nature to approve of anything . " Very well , " she said in a grudging voice , " if it pleases you it 'll have to please me , I suppose . But I know I wo n't sleep well living so close to a murderer ? I told the ladies ? " " Mother ! " Robert spoke harshly . " For God 's sake , I hope you have n't been calling Jon Ferrier a murderer ! ' My God ! That 's libel . Not here in Hambledon , for God 's sake ! " She saw that he was genuinely aghast . She smiled knowingly . " I do hope you can trust my discretion , Robert . I 'm not a fool . And many important people think well of him , and I would n't offend them , for your sake . Do n't take the Almighty 's name in vain ; that 's blasphemy . I do n't like your new manners . But not everyone admires him as you do , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , it does n't matter . " " Mother , do n't lend yourself to gossip here . That would be the one thing that would ruin me forever . " " Robert , you forget that though I ant the mother of a physician I was the wife of one , time But I can hardly shut my ears and pretend that I do n't hear . That would he most impolite . " She uttered a faint shriek and Robert turned quickly . A large fawn and brindle dog , almost as big as a mastiff , was entering the  | room , sniffing alertly , its pointed ears high and quivering . " Oh , that 's just Jon 's dog , " said Robert , and squatted on his heels and snapped his fingers at the animal . " Take the brute away ! " cried Mrs. Morgan , forgetting that she had arthritis , for she sped briskly to the windows and almost crouched there in extreme terror . " Robert ! Do n't touch it ! It may be mad . It may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Robert . The dog had now thrown its great front legs and paws about Robert 's neck and was kissing him with enthusiasm , its big liquid eyes shining delightedly . " Look at the boy , " said Robert , parrying the kisses with not too much success . He laughed . " A boxer . Jon imported him from Germany . His name is Montgomery Sears Ward Roebuck . That 's one of Jon 's little pleasantries , because Monty came in a Sears crate , when he was three months old . Now , boy , " he said to the dog who was taking a sudden interest in Jane Morgan . He had never heard such curious sounds before , a shrill bleating . Moreover Jane was fluttering her handkerchief threateningly at him , and with terror . Robert held his collar tightly , for Monty had decided to investigate this interesting phenomenon . " Do stop screaming , Mother , " said Robert . " Jon must be around someplace ; he never roams without Jon . " At that beloved name Monty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a great grin and looked at the door . He harked cornmAndingly . Jon , dressed for riding , strolled into the echoing parlor . " So , there he is , " he said , and he bowed briefly in Jane 's direction , and then smiled at Robert . " He must have heard your voices ; he shot off like a bullet . There 's nothing so inquisitive as a boxer . They 're terrible gossips , and such , and always want to know what 's going on everywhere . " The dog was standing on his hind legs now , his paws on Jonathan 's chest , and he was licking Jonathan 's cheek with passionate love . Jane shuddered . " I do wish , Dr. Ferrier , that you 'd put him out . I feel quite faint . I 'm terrified of dogs . " " Are you ? Sorry . Here , Monty , " and Jonathan led the dog to the door , expertly pushed him out , and closed the wide double doors . " He would n't hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about rabbits but since he tangled with a skunk a year ago he 's wary of anything in fur . But a wonderful watchdog . " Jane had partially recovered . " I do hope he is n't permitted to roam freely . I 'd be frightened to go out into my own garden , and I 'd feel that the home was threatened . " Robert winced . But Jonathan was smiling smoothly . " You must n't worry . Besides , he 'll be going away with me , eventually . " He looked  | at the woman and tried to conceal his dislike and contempt for her . He turned to Robert . " You 'll be glad to know I waved old Mrs. Winters out this morning , " he said . " Did you ? " Robert 's face was still warm . He said to his mother , " Mrs. Winters was a patient of Jon 's . She died this morning . " Jane was horrified at both Jonathan 's " levity " in the face of death and his look of satisfaction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meaning tone . " She died  --  and you 're glad ? " " Very , very glad , Mrs. Morgan . I was very happy for her . " His eyes were flat and expressionless as he glanced at Robert 's mother . She swallowed , then put her handkerchief daintily to her eyes for a moment in acknowledgment of what she called " the Grim Reaper . " " She was in murk pain , perhaps ? " she suggested . " Not really . Except the pain of living , and now it 's all over for her , and I have n't been so pleased for years . " " A poor woman ? " said Jane . " No . She had been an heiress , and had inherited a lot of money . " It was evident to Robert , who was flushing again , that he was enjoying himself at Mrs. Morgan 's expense . " And she was n't very old , either . Probably your own age , Mrs. Morgan . " " And you 're glad she 's dead ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Very . I 'm usually glad when people die . Dying is nothing . It 's pain that is intolerable . " Jane considered death the ultimate of terrors , and superstitiously never entered a house where it had recently visited and never went to cemeteries . She stared blankly at Jonathan and then her eyes squinted as if she were confirming something she had long ago guessed about him , something exceedingly unpleasant and unspeakable . She nodded , quite perceptibly , agreeing with herself . This dreadful man ! she thought . This , really , monster . What had she heard recently from some newly met ladies ? He had had another patient , a little girl , and there had been something quite mysterious about her death  --  Jane shuddered again and now it was not pretense . " I do feel faint , " she said to Robert , and then quickly simpered at Jonathan as though trying to placate hint as one would attempt to placate a demon , before fleeing . " You must really take me hack to the hotel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , is it settled about this house ? I must let the lawyers know this afternoon . " " I 'm not overly pleased with this hone , " said Jane , cautiously edging around Jonathan , tapping her canes smartly . " Hut I am only your  | mother , Robert . What pleases you must please me . You must n't consider me in the slightest . " Robert gritted his teeth . He did not know whom he detested more at this moment , his mother or Jonathan . Jonathan was smiling idly , and striking his leg with his crop . He went to the door and opened it for Jane but she shrank back . " Coming , Robert ? " " Yes , Mother , " he said . It was extraordinary how he was quite regularly , these days , desiring to hit something very hard . He gave Jonathan a murderous look , but Jonathan merely raised his black eyebrows questioningly . " I hope your dog wo n't annoy my mother , " said Robert . " Where is he now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose . I 'd better go first and corner him . When you hear me whistle it will be safe . Safe . " Jonathan touched his bare head with his crop , in salute to Jane , and went quickly from the room . " Oh , dear , " said Jane . " I ca n't stand him , I really ca n't stand him . He frightens me half to death with his peculiar smile and ? " " His smile is n't peculiar , Mother . He is just trying to get a rise out of you , and he 's succeeding . I 'll take you back to the hotel at once . " He heard a sharp whistle . Jonathan was waiting , holding his dog . The broad steps , fanning out , shone like marble in the hot sunlight . It was a charming house , laced with the frail shadow of the leaves , standing calmly alone on its lawns and among its trees . Jonathan said , " I thought you might like to sec another patient of mine , Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking . You ought to look her over . " He smiled at Robert with broad innocence . But his black eyes were tired and appeared dissipated . " Where shall I meet you ? " Robert was curt . " At the hospital . St. Hilda 's ? " " Not this time . The Friends ' . My patient is n't rich . " Jane made a mouth at Robert , commanding him to refuse , but he said , " In half an hour then . " He did not look back as he led his mother down the long and winding walk to the street and his buggy . Jonathan watched them go . Poor devil , he thought . We 'll have to work on this very strenuously . He studied Jane 's gaunt black back as she hobbled painfully beside her son . A fraud . If she had arthritis , he , Jonathan , had leprosy . He was quite accustomed to these hypochondriacal women who ruled their families with pretended illness , and , unfortunately , usually succeeded . One of these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was showing a desire to accompany Robert , we 'll have to expose her and that will be very pleasant . One good kick in the ass and she 'd be cured . But we must do it more diplomatically . He took Monty to the white fence below the lawns which separated  | the house from the offices , thrust the protesting dog through the gate , and closed it . " Go on home , " he said . " I think Mary 's got a bone for you . Stop grinning at me . " He reached over the gate and pulled one high ear affectionately . Then , whistling , he went down to the street where he had tied his horse . It was a great black gelding who remembered more puissant days , for he arched his neck , showed large teeth , and stamped when he saw his master . " You 're another fraud , " said Jonathan , who mounted dexterously and rode off to the hospital . Robert was still sullen when he met Jonathan in the lobby of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a foolish mother ; it was n't very courteous , however , to make game of one 's mother to one 's face . Jonathan greeted him kindly . " Miss Meadows will be glad to see you , " he said , and tucked Robert 's stiff arm in his . The Friends ' Hospital was strictly utilitarian but thanks to Jonathan it had become what the older doctors said was " entirely too modern and stark . " Jonathan , it was , who had reformed the somewhat archaic system of teaching nurses and had established a nursing school under rigorous discipline . He had also insisted on halving the wards so that none contained more than twelve patients and he had opened windows , ordered dark brown walls to be painted in more cheerful colors and had commanded clean white linoleum on all the floors . The four operating rooms had come under his critical eye , also . Witnesses to operations , he said , must be gowned , capped and masked to avoid contamination of the air . This was all folly to the Chief-of-Staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff , but as Jonathan had offered to pay for the modernizing of the operating rooms they consented with smiles of indulgence . However , as in St. Hilda 's , he had not been successful in his insistence that some of the older surgeons must discard their traditional frock coats and striped trousers and that they should use modern methods of asepsis . The younger ones , trained in better schools , sympathized with him and assured him that time would take care of their elders . " In the meantime these hacks literally get away with murder , " he had said . " We should call this place the Morgue . " The hospital had no spacious grounds as did St. Hilda 's . Its hard granite walls jutted straight up from a busy street , and its windows were tall high slits , rounded at the top in an older style . But it was clean , or as clean as Jonathan 's constant nagging could make it . It had two flbN , rs of private rooms , small but sun filled now ; the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating rooms , the kitchens , and the ( Ater and a meeting room for nurses . The doctors had their own quarters , and they also had a restaurant of sorts , forbidden to  | interns who were usually given a meager tray by student nurses  --  if the latter happened to remember . When Jonathan came here now he came , he felt , as a stranger , no longer involved . He was not as popular here as he was at St. Hilda 's , possibly because he and his family had given the private hospital more money . Very often he encountered resistance and sulky hostility and watchful eyes . He ignored it all . He said to Robert now , " One of these days hospitals will be worse than this . Oh , they 'll be cleaner and more modern and very , very big . But they 'll be totally indifferent and impersonal . We are already beginning to think of patients as stomachs , livers , colons , uteruses , rectums , gall bladders , and what all , and not as people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making him less than a man . You ca n't insult his humanity by thinking of him as a mere collection of organs without injuring him spiritually , and even bodily . An anthill is a fine place for ants , and collective effort is fine for ants . But man is not an ant . I 've been reading H. G. Wells recently . He approves of ant life . He also admires Karl Marx , who thought ant communities the most desirable way to live . " He and Robert were approaching one of the big elevators . The wide corridors hummed with activity . Jonathan pursed his lips . " Remember Shakespeare 's eulogy of the bees ? " The singing masons building roofs of gold . ' Well , there 'll be masons in the future , millions of them , but they wo n't he singing and the roofs wo n't be golden . I do n't think I 'm going to like this century . It already has the combined stink of a hive , or an anthill , where man is diminished and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . ' But it 's not a new story . The ant heaps of Alexandria , Athens , Rome , Thebes , and the others , went the way of human ant heaps because man is not an ant and he will never be one . That is , if he takes very good care in the coming decades . He never did in the past . He probably wo n't now . " " Cheerful , " said Robert , still feeling resentment . " No . Just a historian . And I 've seen the old crowded ruins , built one cell upon another , like a hive , with all the land around them . Perhaps I 'm wrong . Perhaps man is , after all , only a bee or an ant . Sometimes I wonder . Creatures that by a rule in nature teach/ The act of order to a peopled kingdom . ' Shakespeare 's darling little bees again . But the act of order ' declines into chaos ; always does . There 's something anarchistic in man , and I , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only guarantee against tyranny . " They went into one of the large elevators . " That reminds me . Here , in Hambledon , we have very lively Fourth of July celebrations . In the square . With a band and flags and howling politicians . You might enjoy seeing how the peasants enjoy themselves . "  | " You really hate this place now , do n't you ? " Robert was still surly . " Well , let 's put it this way : I do n't believe in unrequited love . " His nonchalance infuriated Robert for some reason . The younger man tugged at his reddish mustache and gave Jonathan a sidelong look . He never saw and talked with Jonathan without feeling heated , disturbed , confused , bewildered , sad or angry . There had been times when he had felt awed and touched ; there were more times when he wanted to punch Jonathan . He no sooner felt admiration but that he immediately felt rage . Jonathan was much too protean for him . He was afraid of the day when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not wait for Jonathan to leave . There was no getting close to Jonathan , no way of approaching him . The slightest effort in that direction was met with sudden coldness or a sardonic remark . The back of the old man who was operating the elevator had stiffened , and as Jonathan and Robert left the operator he gave Jonathan a look of intense hatred intensified by the cunning knowingness of his curled mouth . Robert was not feeling entirely friendly toward Jonathan but he paused a moment to stare with haughty rebuke at the old man , who immediately ducked his head and closed the elevator door . " What is it ? " asked Jonathan , but Robert said nothing . They walked down a long corridor , then Robert said , " I thought your patient was in a ward . " " She was . I took her out and put her in a private room , at my own expense . She has never had real privacy in her life , but now she deserves it . I did n't tell you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rectum and colon . The poor old soul could not afford earlier treatment , though I frankly say that I do n't think there is any cure for that disease . You can arrest it  --  sometimes  --  and in some cases of skin cancer it can be eliminated  --  sometimes . They disagree with me , of course , but I think it is a systematic disease and not local , not local even when it appears confined . If Miss Meadows had come a year ago or even six months ago we might have been able to do something , at least to prolong her life . But eventually it would 've caught up with her . What are a few more years of life  --  when one is old and has never lived at all ? " " Another like Mrs. Winters ? " " No , the reverse . She must have been pretty once ; she was my firstgrade teacher and I remember her as pretty and as plump and warm as a muffin right from the stove . She must have had what our parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sisters , and parents , and somehow teachers get tied in to support the whole damned family . It 's their duty , ' everyone says , when even elementary common sense , not to mention religion , should teach people that their first duty is to satisfy themselves as individuals before they can march off to do some-  | thing for anyone else . But teachers , I 've noticed , are born martyrs . Otherwise , they would n't be teachers . Dedicated souls . I wonder why ? I can pick kids out who will end up teachers . They just foam with a quiet sense of responsibility . " So Miss Anne Meadows , the dedicated , responsible soul who loved everybody , and wanted to serve ' everybody , in the ineffable way of teachers , supported her parents and put her brothers and sisters on their feet . Nobody was grateful ; no one ever thought poor Anne was entitled to a life of her own . She was only doing that which was proper . ' No one even dreamed that perhaps Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retire from the damnable weariness of struggling with obdurate young things who did n't want to learn anything in the first place . She was just Anne Meadows , a teacher , with a duty : She never complained . " Well , the brothers and sisters went off , after an education provided by their sister , and insofar as they were concerned the parents were still Anne 's responsibility . She must have agreed . By this time she was fifty , and I 've noticed that the parents of schoolteachers seem to live to be incredibly old . Then she was sixty , and the parents were still alive , but they were pettish and complaining and senile , and Anne had to endure them after a full days work . Then she was sixty-five , and God apparently became aware of her  --  belatedly  --  and took her parents off her hands . " One brother and one nephew came to their funerals . My mother and I were there  --  but I was the only former pupil . I 'd seen Miss Meadows over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to herself , first of all , but the poor soul was honestly shocked . That 's another symptom of the teacher-malady . Now she is sixty-eight . Her eyesight failed ; she had to retire . On the most miserable little pension you ever heard of . I did hear of it . I sent her a cashier 's check , anonymously , every month ; otherwise she 'd have starved and done scrubbing or something to make ends meet . She never hears from her family ; they 've forgotten she exists . After all , do n't schoolteachers make such large salaries ' ? Anne was never able to save a cent . But again , she never complained . " That 's the saga of martyrs . If there are such creatures as saints , Anne is one ; she has all the heroic , pathetic virtues , and I , for one , have no use for saints . They 're such an infernal annoyance to the rest of us . By the way , she thinks my monthly check is a tender remembrance from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month . " Robert was incredulous . " And they never tell her ? " Jonathan halted and looked at him with amusement . " Why , no . Do n't you know anything about your dear fellowman ? They probably think  | she is senile , or that she is mocking them . So they never write to her . She thinks they do n't want to be thanked ! So she knits and sews little gifts for them , and sends them off every Christmas with her love , for God 's sake ! " I ca n't do anything for her . But I have an operation in mind which sets the backs up of the hacks who pretend to be very pious and believe that suffering is the lot of man . ' I 've done the operation before , but it 's tricky . You can watch tomorrow . I cut the nerves which lead to the cancerous regions . That stops the pain , anyway , and she 's in agony except when she 's tender opiates . And think of this : She called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's been suffering hell . But then , she 's been suffering hell all her life and one more torment was almost nothing to her . " Robert shook his head . " If people wo n't take care of themselves and offer themselves up for martyrdom , can others be blamed if they take advantage ? " But he was troubled . The hard white ridges sprang out about Jonathan 's mouth . " Anyone who takes willful advantage of another , robs another of his substance , lives at the expense of others , and flourishes on another 's work and grows fat on it , ca n't be called a man . He 's a parasite , and he 's done a worse harm to himself than he has to his victim . He 's become a simple structure , physically and mentally , as parasites always become simple structures , almost primitive . You 've seen parasites , under the microscope , and even with the naked eye . They lose their means of locomotion , their ability to survive away from their host . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for suffering the parasite . Do you remember what St. Paul said : ' He who does not work , neither shall he eat . ' That was more of a warning to the host than to the parasite he makes . No one has the right to make others dependent , even in the name of sweet charity . Charity must be an emergency measure , short in duration ? or you destroy a man 's very soul . The Puritans understood that ; they got a man back on his feet fast and made him support himself at the first possible moment . No malingering . He worked , or he starved . " Robert smiled , forgetting his resentment . " You should have been a tea ( her or one of these new sociologists . " Jonathan lifted himself away from the wall on which he had been leaning . He seemed exceptionally tired and his eyes were bloodshot . " I have a feeling about this damned century , " he said . " Something not very clean . " They walked a few more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neatly lettered sign on it . I Ie chuckled , and by the glare of the naked overhead electric light Robert read : PI EMIR KNOCK AND WAIT POR PERMISSION TO ENTER . " Mks Meadows wrote that herself , and I think it 's wonderful . " Jona-  | than laughed . " All her life was surrounded by people  --  her parasitic family  --  and the thousands of kids she taught and interfering relatives urging her to do her duty , ' in short , not to bother them . Her life was made up of bells and beds , blackboards and blackguards , pounding feet and pounding voices , dust , chalk , dishes , clatter , clatter , clatter . Now , at last , she has a chance to be alone . Not even the nurses dare come in without the preliminary knock and permission . Alone . That 's a marvelous thing  --  being alone . We do n't fully appreciate it . And I have the funniest damned feeling that we 're coming into an era where no one will let you alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of social feeling , ' as that idiot Horace Mann called it . " He knocked on the door and after a moment a woman 's voice said a little forbiddingly , " Who is it ? " " Jon Ferrier , Miss Anne . " " Oh , come in , come in ! " They went in to a large , whitewashed room sparkling with sunlight , and Robert saw the small round figure sitting up in the bed , smoothing back astonishingly black thick hair about a plump and very ashen face . He had expected to see some mortal wreck of a poor aged woman , but Miss Meadows looked quite well , and her round features beamed , and only her color suggested desperate illness . As he walked closer to her he saw that her large brown eyes , however , were clouded and glazed with the opiates she had been given , and she suddenly yawned , then smiled , and held out her small fat hand to Jonathan . Jonathan held her hand between both of his and said , " Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you about , my replacement . " She nodded at Robert courteously and scrutinized him with the quick intelligence and awareness of a teacher being introduced to a new pupil of whom she must form a concise opinion . " What a nice red-gold boy , " she said , and gave him her other hand . It was hot and tremulous . " I do n't imagine you ever caused anyone any trouble in your life , did you , Doctor ? " " Come to think of it , I did n't , " said Robert . " Perhaps that 's what 's wrong with me . " She laughed and it was a pleasant , understanding sound . " Now Jonnie , here , was the worst little boy I ever had . Always in disputations with everything . Always certain of everything . A fierce little boy . Born , I always said to his mother , with an outrageous sense of right and wrong and never willing to compromise . " She yawned again . The soft muscles of her full face contracted with a spasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the born teacher 's perfect control of herself , even in unbearable pain . " I adored him , " she said , " and I thrashed him twice as much as I ever thrashed any of my other children . He was perfectly horrible to his little brother , too . Harald . "  | She looked at Jonathan tenderly , and the clouded eyes brightened with mischief and affection . " Jonnie , I know that you 're paying for this room . I interrogated one of the nurses , and the poor girl , she 's a student , was forced to tell me . Never mind , Jonnie . You know I 'd never accept anything for free  --  ever . So , I asked my lawyer to come to me yesterday , and he did , and I left Papa 's old house to you , and the few dollars I have in the hank . Please do n't say anything . The house is n't worth more than two thousand ; so old and decrepit , you know , but the land is getting valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to . I Just want to be sure you have it  --  and nobody else . " Her voice weakened . " Well , " said Jonathan . He said , " How about your family ? " She smiled curiously . " Jonnie , I 'm an old woman and sometimes old women get revelations . Or maybe they 're inquisitive . I know you 're the one who has been sending me that mysterious monthly cashier 's check . Please do n't deny it . " 1 irr voice , her eyes , her hair and her manner were that of a young girl , and Robert recalled that most of the teachers he had known had had this odd youthfulness into very old age . Was it because they had associated with children so much , or was it an innate quality of the spirit ? She was still holding Jonathan 's hand , and now she bent her head and touched her cheek to it , like a mother . " Such a lovely boy , " she said . " Jonnie , you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you away . You 'll never get over it , if you do . Do n't make me think I was wrong about you . You always had such courage . " " Now , Miss Anne , " said Jonathan . " You are n't my teacher any longer . I 'm a big boy now . How did you sleep last night ? " " Very well ; better than for many months . " " You should have come to me sooner . " She smiled at him with beautiful candor . " Well , Jonnie , I knew that you treated so many people without charging them . I knew you would n't charge me . So , I kept away from you . Yes , I know I could have gone to other doctors  --  but they would have charged me , and I could n't afford it . What was a poor woman to do ? " Jonathan sat down on the edge of the bed and looked at her with gravity . " Miss Anne , you know I 'm going to operate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater part of your pain . But you know it is n't going to make much difference in the long run , do n't you ? " " Yes . I know , jonnic . I 'm glad you do n't try to fool me . You know , I never did have much time to think about God , but now I - do . It 's very interesting . In a way it 's the most exciting thing that ever happened to me , speculating about God , and where I 'm going . When my eyes are n't to() tired I study that Bible I brought with me . ' Surely man  | lives again . ' That 's quite comforting . I just hope , " she said with her merry smile , " that they do n't assign me to teaching again , not for a very long time . I just hope that they 'll let me live in a small wooden house with roses , in the midst of a deep forest , and listen to the birds sing . All alone . " Jonathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't believe it , do you , sweetheart ? " " No , " he said , " I do n't . But I may be wrong . I hope , for your sake , that I am . " She sighed , and then quirked her eyebrows questioningly at Robert . " I hope you 're a more pious boy than Jonnie is , Dr. Morgan . " Then she returned to Jonathan . Her face changed . " Do n't leave me , Jonnie , Jonnie , do n't leave me ! " There was a sudden terror in her voice . " I wo n't , I wo n't . You know I wo n't . " He hesitated . " I know you are n't a Catholic . But would you like a friend of mine to come to see you , just to chat , a Father McNulty ? He wo n't preach at you or soundoff periods at you . But he could tell you things that might interest you ; after all , it 's his specialty . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The terror had left her voice . " Thank you , Jonnie . And we 'll plot together how to keep you where you 're needed so much . " A nurse came in with a hypodermic of morphine , but it was Jonathan who swabbed Miss Meadow 's arm with alcohol and who inserted the needle . She kept her eye on him , the thoughtful eyes of a teacher . " Now I 'll sleep , " she said . " And I did want to think . " Robert had seen hundreds of patients during his internship but he had never before seen such absolute courage and fortitude . He knew that her suffering must be terrible . Yet her concern was for Jonathan . As the nurse settled her on her pillows and smoothed her sheet and blanket she said , " You must n't go away , dearest , you must n't . It would kill you , forever . It never does to run ; you just stand up and face them , even if your back is against the wall . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to remember you like that . Jonnie ? " " I 'm not a coward , " he said . In a moment she was serenely asleep , but now the full furrows of her torment were deep on her forehead and about her mouth . The nurse said , " Oh , Dr. Ferrier . The Chief-ofStaff , Dr. Bedloe , is particularly anxious to see you . He said it was most important . " " The hell with him , " said Jonathan . He looked down at the sleeping woman . " I wish she 'd drop away , like that , and never.wake up again . This thing can disintegrate the most courageous patient ; I do n't want to see her at the last , as she 'll be . "  | Robert said , out of his youth and ignorance , " I do n't think she 'll disintegrate . " " She will , she will , " said Jonathan . " She 's not the only one who 's keeping me in this town . I ca n't go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this disease ; she may live a week or six months more . " He looked bitterly at Robert . " I know it 's our duty to keep them alive . I just wonder why , that 's all . " The nurse gave him a prim hard look , then said again , " Dr. Bedloe is particularly anxious to see you , Doctor . " " So you said . And I said , the hell with him . " He took Robert 's arm . " I ca n't do you any damage now . You 've been accepted on the staff . And Bcdloc 's going to he your particular misery . One of the old diploma-mill hacks with not a tenth of the sense Dr. Bogus had . " Robert recalled Dr. Bedloe as a tall and stately middle-aged man with a pink complexion , cold blue eyes and an authoritative manner and an absolutely positive voice . Like so many of his kind he had a thick and flowing mop of white and silken hair , and he was reputed to be very wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , as he and Robert left the room , " I 'd call Bedloe an anus , except that would be disparaging a very hard-working and long-suffering part of the body , much abused and rarely giving any trouble except to the sedentary . I think I 'll just call him a cloaca , which is n't flattering the cloaca , which always serves some purpose , which Bedloe does n't . Except that he does , in a way , cleanly carry away a lot of the bloody sewage his pet hacks spew up in the operating rooms . Cleanly away , with no one suspecting except a lot of us younger doctors and most of us would n't dare say anything . I always did . He hates my guts . " The nurse twitched her long white skirts out into the hall after them . " Dr. Bedloe , " she began , in her admonishing voice , and then she brightened . " Oh , here he is now ! " Dr. Humphrey Bedloe was indeed bearing down on them like an eagle . " Jon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught you ! It 's very important . " " Well , " said Jonathan , leaning negligently against the wall , " what have I done now ? You know I do n't have but half a dozen patients in this penitentiary these days . " Then he looked at the older man with curiosity . ' What 's the matter  --  Doctor ? Having a touch of angina again ? " Dr. Bedloe was indeed pale and appeared agitated . He nodded curtly at the nurse , who scuttled away . Ile hit at the end of his silken white mustache , Ile glanced warily at Robert . " I must speak to you alone , ) on . It 's of the utmost importance . " " Speak away , " said Jonathan , not moving . " Bob here is my replacement . He 'll be cleaning up : after your butchers , who do n't even have  | a sense of proportion enough to wear the straw hat of an honest butcher . Speak away . " Dr. Bedloe 's agitation increased . He gave Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have obeyed that glance and would have discreetly moved off . Now he stood solidly on his big legs and did not stir . For an instant Dr. Bedloe openly and actively disliked him and there was a blue glitter of ominous threat in his eyes . " It 's very private , Jon . " " Nothing 's private . Not to me , any longer . " Again the older man savagely bit on his mustache . Then he said , " It 's my niece , you know her , Hortense Nolan . You were at her wedding . She married the Nolan boy . Oh , damn it , Jon ! I ca n't stand here like this and inform the whole hospital ! " " If I remember , " said Jonathan , " you did inform the whole hospital . About me . Even before I was arrested . In fact , you did n't even wait for the indictment before you had me removed from the staff . A very precipitate fella , you . Dear , paternal Humphrey . " " My God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , saw actual despair on the man 's face . " Why do you bring that up now ? Is n't it over with ? I 'm thinking of Hortense . I 've thought lots of things about you , Jon . Always did . But I never thought you were malicious . " Now Jonathan was looking intently at him . " There is something wrong , is n't there ? Well , what about Hortense ? Pretty girl , if I remember . Lots of red hair and big white teeth . Nineteen ? Well ? " " It 's  --  you know , Jon . You know all about it ! She was pregnant ? " " Yes . I remember . And I recommended young Harrington to you , when you asked me ' to deliver her . But young , modern doctors are n't good enough for you and your family , are they ? You said old Schaefer would deliver her . That 's it , is n't it ? " " Yes . " Dr. Bedloe bent his head . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . Five days ago . A nice baby , a boy . " " Well ? " " It 's this , Jon ? " " Now , do n't tell me the girl has puerperal fever , for God 's sake ! " " Peritonitis . " Jonathan lifted himself from the wall and he looked at Dr. Bedloe with open hatred and disgust . " I told you . Old Schaefer is n't fit to deliver a cow . Never washes his hands ; it 's a principle of his , since asepsis was introduced years ago . He does n't believe in germs even now , does he ? But he 's such a benign old bastard and gives the girls such encouragement and pats their cheeks sweetly before he slaps the chloroform over their noses . Peritonitis , by God ! Well , what did you expect ? "  | " She 's dying , Jon . She 's like a daughter to me ; never had any of my own . And she 's dying . They telephoned me from St. Hilda 's just now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now today ? " " And he infected her , the bloody old swine , with his patting dirty hands . What had he been doing before ? An autopsy ? " Dr. Bedloe spread out his hands . " Jon , they think she needs an immediate operation  --  to save her life . She  --  she bled a little more than ordinarily after the delivery . Thought she was out of danger . Jon , she 's dying . " Jonathan said in a loud voice , " An operation ? Hysterectomy ? At her age ? " All at once Dr. liedloe looked old and stricken and sick . " It 's even worse . The  --  the baby died last night . A  --  a brain injury , birth injury , I think . Was doing so well , too , in spite of the high forceps . All at once . She 's only nineteen , Jon . " " Sweet Jesus , " said Jonathan . Robert Morgan did not even wince . He was too horrified . " Jon , Louis Hedler said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone can save Hortense it is you . " " Good old Louis , " said Jonathan . He shook his head . " Look , Humphrey , I 'm not going to get into this , not even for little Hortense . It 's your dirty work ; you 're not going to smear me with it . Where 's old Schaefer ? " " He never leaves her for a moment . It 's  --  pathetic ? " " I bet it is . She 's his goddaughter , is n't she ? No , I 'm not getting into this filthy mess and then letting you sing it out that it was all my fault . No , Humphrey . I 'm sorry , but the mess is in your own lap . " Dr. Bedloe grasped Jon 's arm . " Please , Jon . " His voice broke . " Do n't think of anything else but Hortense . I promise you ? " " Sure you will . Anything as of now . But if Hortense dies , and she probably will , then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife who spread it around that there was something mysterious about little Martha Best 's death ? Yes , it was . My mother told me . " " Jon , I 'll be there in the operating room . Half a dozen of us will be there . " " Fine , line . In your get-my frock coats . No , thank you . I 'm sorry about Iortense . But call Harrington , Humphrey , as you should have called hint in the beginning . " Dr. lkcdloe seemed alxtut to burst into tears . " I  --  I thought about that . He refuses , " " Cixd for Phil , Iiok , 1'Il say a prayer for Hortense , if I can remember who to , but not for me , Humphrey . "  | He shook his head and turned away , then caught young Robert 's eyes . He stared and said with disgust , " Oh , not you , too ! " " I 'll be there , " said Robert . " I 'll help . " " You and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempt . " Let me warn you : Never clean up after the hacks . Or try to . After it 's too late the hacks will sing , He did it , he did it ! ' They never forgive us for having a decent medical education . Come on. , " Please , Jon , " said Dr. Bedloe . " What more can this stinking town say about me ? Just that I murdered Hortense . Bob ? Coming ? We 're going over to St. Hilda 's . " CHAPTER NINE Jonathan and Robert arrived at St. Hilda 's after a fast ride through the town . They had not spoken , though Jonathan had given Robert many a grim and accusatory glance as if all this were the younger man 's fault , and as if Robert had forced him into this dangerous situation . But Robert smiled under his mustache . They went at once to the luxurious suite of young Hortense Nolan , and there Jonathan found Dr. Emil Schaefer sitting beside the bed of Hortense , who was whining painfully and protesting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " just a little , dear . This good broth . This dainty piece of chicken , this hot buttered muffin . You must keep up your strength . " Jonathan walked in , almost running , swept the spoon from the doctor 's hand , and lifted the filled and steaming tray and hurled it furiously against the wall with a resounding crash . " God damn it ! " he exclaimed . " Are you trying to kill the girl ? Out , out . I want a conference with all of you . " Dr. Schaefer , a short and rosy man with a bald head and a thick gray beard , stared at him as at a mad dog , and he rose slowly , his blue eyes blank and staring . Dr. Bedloe , who had followed on Jonathan 's heels , looked with dismay at the ruins of the " nourishing lunch , " but said as easily as he could , " Emil , I called Jon Ferrier  --  he 's used to these things  --  and we 'd like to consult with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Schaefer stammered . " Emil , she 's my niece . There are some modern things , you know ? " The fair fat face of Dr. Schaefer turned very white . " If he touches her , then I must leave the case , Bedloe . " " Louis Hedler has also asked Jon , " said Dr. Bedloe , in terror of Jonathan 's refusal . " Please , Emil. "  | " On second thought , " said Jonathan , " I want him here . I want to ask him some questions . I also want those two last-year interns , Moe Abrams and Jed Collins , who 've been suffering enough under the hacks . I also want Louis . Go and get them , Humphrey . " He spoke to the Chief-of-Staff of the Friends ' as if he were a lackey . " I wo n't even look at the girl until you 're all here . And you might tell Moe and Jed to bring their notebooks . This is not only for their information but for my own protection . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black eyes flashed at Dr. Bedloe threateningly . I ) r . Schaefer took out his handkerchief and wiped the sweat from his face and his hands . Jonathan took one step toward him , seized the handkerchief , stared at the elderly man and then at his hands , then threw the handkerchief into his face . " So , you have a cold , have you ? And you 've been examining her  --  how many times today , you criminal fool ? With germ-laden hands ? " " I wo n't stand this ! " said Dr. Schaefer . " I wo n't hear these insults from a jackanapes , an incompetent , who even bungled ? " " Emil , for God 's sake ! " cried Dr. Bedloe in an agonized voice . " Deliberately , " added Dr. Schaefer , who appeared on the verge of a stroke . " Never mind him , Humphrey , " said Jonathan . " Go and get those people . Let him stand here and blubber . He 'll have enough to do to answer questions later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were sheathing daggers . Does he have to be so violent ? Robert asked of himself , then he moved slowly to the fine brass bed and looked down at the young girl there . Hortense Nolan lay high on a bolster and pillows and sheets of the best and softest linen , and it was evident to Robert that she was almost moribund with sepsis . She was so slender and small and young that she appeared to be hardly more than twelve years of age , and her mass of red hair was in strong contrast to the ashen pallor of her little face . It flowed over her pillows like a flag of danger and fell over her panting hrrast . I ler eyes were half open and sunken in gray pits ; their color was clouded by a glaucous film . Her nostrils were pale and pinched , her lips faintly purple . She was delicately made , with the slightest of alms , the daintiest of hands . The latter were pulling restlessly and aimlessly at the bed linen , and Robert felt sick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly silent room . But Jonathan would not look at her ; he st ( wxl at the windows and stared out , while Dr. Schaefer pressed his fat back hard against the wall near the door . Two nurses came in and hurried to the bed . Jonathan said without turning , " Do n't go near that bed or touch that girl ! "  | The nurses gaped at him , and both their fresh-colored faces hardened with surprise and knowing significance . They turned as one to Dr. Schaefer and spoke to him obsequiously , " Doctor , Mrs. Nolan 's parents and her husband are outside and wish to see Mrs. Nolan . " " Yes , yes , " said the overwhelmed man . " Of course . Send them in . " " No , " said Jonathan . " If they come in , I go  --  out . And I wo n't come back . " But the nurses only awaited Dr. Schaefer 's orders , smiling contemptuously , ignoring Jonathan . Dr. Schaefer hesitated . His effort to come to a decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's back with hate . " I  --  we  --  we are having a consultation , " he said to the nurses . One of them , the older , stepped back in astonishment . " With Doctor ? Ferrier ? " " With Dr. Ferrier , " said Dr. Schaefer . The young women gaped again . They turned their heads slowly and regarded Jonathan at the window . Their astonishment grew immense . " Please leave , " said Dr. Schaefer in a choked voice . The girls flurried from the room , their long white skirts rustling . They could not wait to report this incredible scene to their sisters . Robert could hear their fluting and agitated voices retreating down the hall . Silence entered the room again , except for the anguished breathing of the dying girl , who appeared to be totally unaware of the men in the room , the broad sunlight of afternoon and the corridor noises and the soft wind lifting the frilled curtains at the windows . She had sunken into that profound detachment and distance which is the anteroom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert saw his pale and sallow cheek , the hard jutting of his cheekbones and jaw , the tensity of his whole body as if he were on the point of losing control of himself . The door swung open and Dr. Hedler , accompanied by Dr. Bedloe , and the two young interns , entered hurriedly . " Jon ! " cried Louis Hedler . " It was good of you to  --  ah  --  attend this consultation ! Very good ! " Jonathan turned slowly from the window , but he looked at the interns while he replied , " I want this understood : I came under pressure . My common sense told me to refuse . I came against my will , and because I 'm a damned sentimentalist and have a soft heart for young victims of obdurate and medieval old hacks who never heard of Semmelweis and Lister , and who continue to murder at their will . I came to expose you , as the American Medical Association wants you exposed . I want to rid hospitals of you . That 's too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of you . " " Jon , " said Louis Hedler , " ca n't we save these insults for later ? Hortense is almost in extremist " But Jonathan continued to look at the interns . " Moe Abrams , " he  | said . " It was your co-religionist , Ignaz Semmelweis , who , in 1847 , isolated the cause of puerperal fever in postpartum females . Lack of asepsis , and coming from dissection rooms to maternity wards with the blood of the dead on ' medical ' hands . His chief , Johann Klein , drove him from his native land , Hungary , with calumny and hatred , out of his vanity and his contempt for ' modern methods . ' He almost drove Semmelweis mad . And then , there was Joseph Lister . But he was also laughed at . " Both these pioneers are still derided by the diploma-mill hacks we have with us today . " " Jon , " said 1 ) r . Heiner . " Louis , " said Jonathan , " you and Schaefer here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat dogs . I know I 'd never let you touch my boxer , Monty . You 'd probably kill him . " ' l'he two interns smiled fleetingly at each other and then with admiration at Jonathan . " I , " said Jonathan , " would n't permit you to treat me for a first-degree burn . " Ile pointed to the bed . " Yet , you have probably killed little I I ortense here . " He moved to the bed , and regarded the interns with gravity . " Boys , " he went on , " I want you to take voluminous notes here . I 'll ask my questions slowly so you can take them down . I want you to put down the replies , too . " " Unethical ! " cried Dr. Schaefer and looked imploringly at his friends , Louis Hedler and Humphrey Bedloe . But they uneasily avoided his eyes . " Am I on trial here ? " " Yes . You are , and all the rest with you , " said Jonathan . He opened his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time gave all his attention to Hortense . He studied her with absolute concentration , leaning forward over her but not touching her . Then he said , " Fetch a nurse with a hypodermic of 15 mg/cc of morphine , at once . " " Morphine ! " cried Dr. Schaefer . " When she can hardly breathe ! " " Louis , " said Jonathan , not lifting his head . Dr. Hedler hesitated , then rang the bell for a nurse and when she appeared hurriedly gave her the order . " I lc will kill her , " said Dr. Schaefer in a low and desperate tone . Jonathan glanced at the interns . " Morphine reduces peristalsis , as you know , among other things . This is a case not only of puerperal fever , but of extensive peritonitis . " Now he began to examine the girl . She moaned feebly . IIc threw aside the sheets . Then he uttered the foulest oath Robert had ever heard . " A filthy tampon ! " he said . " A dirty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look at it ! " and he held the object up high in the air . " Filled with what our friends here would call ' salutary pull ' ( ) r something . When in hell did her bleeding stop , Emil ? " 1 ) r . Schaefer despairingly noted that the interns were busily scribbling .  | " Until yesterday morning  --  she bled quite a little . That 's why I ordered the tampon . " The nurse came in with the hypodermic of morphine , and handed it with a disdainful flourish to Jonathan , who deftly injected the fluid into Hortense 's arm . She moaned faintly . The nurse , smirking , retreated to the door but stood there . She would have such funny news for the other girls ! Robert saw the smirk , and his old conviction of the " goodness " of human nature was strongly shaken again . What had Jonathan said ? " Man is not good , he is intrinsically malicious and evil and desires only a bad fate for his brother . " Well . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth for one 's peace of mind . Jonathan threw the yellowed tampon on a tray and extended it to the interns . He said , as they looked at it with horror , " Now , Emil . Did you sew up lacerations ? " " I did . " Dr. Schaefer 's eyes burned with humiliation and his pallor increased . " After the high forceps ? Yes . And did you sterilize the forceps ? No . Did you use modern methods of asepsis on your hands ? No . Rubber gloves ? No . Boys , you have all this ? " Young Dr. Abrams said with portentous solemnity , " Yes , Doctor . " " Good . Now , Emil . Were you certain that all the placenta was de-livered ? " Dr. Schaefer moved heavily against the wall . " I believe it was . It ? appeared so . " Jonathan pounced on him . " You believe it was ! ' Are n't you sure ? Doctor ? " Dr. Schaefer spoke in a loud and rapid voice . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How many died  --  Doctor ? Of hemorrhage ? Of puerperal fever ? Of extensive peritonitis ? " " I am not compelled to answer that ! I will not ! " " No , " said Jonathan . " The Fifth Amendment protects you from selfincrimination . So  --  we have here a distinct possibility of remnants of the placenta being retained , which in itself would cause all this damage . Moreover , an ominous situation is that the normal discharge has been inhibited , and pus has taken its place . " He looked at Dr. Hedler . " I want an operating room prepared at once . " Dr. Hedler nodded to the nurse and she flurried out , bursting with news . Jonathan continued to examine Hortense , speaking slowly . He held the chart in his hand and checked it with his examination , nodding at times . " Tachycardia . Vomiting . Rigidity of the abdomen . You will no-  | tice , Dr. Abrams and Dr. Collins , that I do not do a vaginal examination . The patient has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I will not  --  I " began l ) r .

" Jonathan stood up and stared at him with disgust . " Quack ? I ? Look in the mirror , Emil . If I save this girl  --  which I doubt I can ? it will be no kudos to you . It will be in spite of you . " Dr. Schaefer spread out his hands to his colleagues . " Louis ! Humphrey ! You know what happened ! To his wife . You 'll let that happen to Hortense ? " Robert did not blame Jonathan for what he did then . Jonathan walked quickly to Dr. Schaefer and struck him savagely across the face . The loud crack seemed to explode the quiet of the room . Dr. Schaefer staggered back and put his hand to his cheek . Everyone stood mute and unmoving , and aghast , except for the young interns who regarded their boots demurely . Dr. Schaefer said , " I 'll have you arrested for assault and battery ! " Jonathan said , " And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ignorance and stupidity and your unfitness even to enter a hospital rnnm . If this girl dies , Emil , as sure as God I 'll tell the husband to institute proceedings against you . " He looked at Louis HedIer . " And against this hospital , for permitting this man to use its facilities and in aiding and abetting him . " Hs black eyes seemed on ( ire . The stretcher arrived for Hortense ; she was snoring heavily under the influence of the morphine . Jonathan did not look at the older doctors . He said to Robert and the interns , " Ready , as soon as possible . With your notrlww ) kc " I Ic shook his head . " Here is Hortense in an open suite in the  | maternity section ! Do you know how dangerous this is ? The infection can spread to the other mothers . She must be isolated , after her return from the operating room  --  if she survives the operation , which I doubt . Complete isolation . And no one who attends her must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had overlooked something very vital . When he entered the sitting room of the suite he saw gathered there Mr. and Mrs. Horace Kimberley , the parents of Hortense , and her young husband , Jeffrey Nolan . Jonathan said under his breath , " Oh ? , " another unspeakable word to Robert . Dr. Schaefer was already talking to the tearful mother , who had flaming hair like her daughter 's and was as fat and round as a middle-aged and amiable hen . Her wet eyes were like big bronze coins , and she was fussily dressed in a welter of pink ruffles to her insteps and wore a huge straw hat bending under a burden of great pink roses . Her husband was almost as small , but he was thin and boyish of figure and face and possessed an enormous black mustache . The husband , Jeffrey Nolan , was a serious young man , all pince-nez , light hair , and cleanshaven nervous face , a very rich young man who had inherited " old " money , which had placed him far above those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil wells . " Louis Hedler and Humphrey Bedloe were disagreeably startled , and the latter put his hand on Jonathan 's arm . But Jonathan pushed it off and advanced on the four with a cold and angry expression . Dr. Schaefer had apparently been talking urgently to the others , and his face was flushed and one cheek was streaked with the crimson of Jonathan 's blow . It was Jeffrey Nolan who spoke to Jonathan , while the frantic parents blinked in confusion and fear . " Hello , Jon , " he said , and held out his dry and narrow hand . " What 's this I hear ? Humphrey called you , is that right ? But Dr. Schaefer tells us that Hortense is really getting better ? Operation ! Jon , she 's only nineteen , and the baby died ! " " Now , wait , " said Jonathan , ignoring Dr. Schaefer and speaking to the other three . " I have to be blunt because there is practically no time , Jeff , Mrs. Kimberley , Mr. Kimberley . No time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peritonitis . Please let me finish . Did n't Schaefer tell you that ? She needs cleaning out , Jeff , what is called a D &C,; dilation and curettage  --  I do n't know yet . The abscess also needs evacuating . Drainage established . I have to do it at once , right now . She 's almost in extremis , Jeff , do you understand that ? She will be dead in less than twenty-four hours , if I do n't operate . That 's certain . " " I do n't agree ! " shouted Dr. Schaefer . " She is definitely improving !  | She has longer periods out of coma ! Her heart sounds are better ! She just needs nourishment , for her strength , and good nursing ? ! " " Jon ? " said the young husband in a voice as dry as his hand . But his eyes were full of beggary . " She will die , and very soon , unless I perform that operation , " said Jonathan . " That I can promise you with absolute certainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ; I wanted Schaefer to suffer from the butchery he is guilty of , and the incompetence and the scorn of what he calls ' modern methods . ' Young I Iarrington refused to be involved with this , for excellent reasons . Jeff , say the word and I 'll withdraw . It 's no mess of mine . " 1 ) r . Schaefer pleaded with the parents . " Julie , did n't I deliver you of two children and did you suffer ? " " No , " said the weeping mother . " It was all perfect . Horace , I do n't know if we should give the permission . I 'm so upset ; I ca n't think . " Jonathan said , " Mrs. Kimberley , it is n't in your hands to give the decision . It 's in Jeff 's , the husband 's . Well , Jeff ? " Jeffrey looked despairingly at Louis Hedler and Humphrey Bedloe , who had come tip to them . " It 's quite true , Jeff , " said Dr. Hedler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " muttered the young man . He caught Jonathan by the arm . " Tell me , Jon ! If you operate  --  will she live ? " " I do n't know . As of this minute , I do n't think so , Jeff . She has sepsis . She 's terribly infected . I wo n't go into the details ; you would n't understand them , anyway . She will assuredly die without the operation ; with it , she has one chance in a thousand . That 's all I can promise you . She 's far gone . " " ' Far gone ? ' Jon , ca n't you give us any hope ? " " Not much . Practically none . I can only do what I can to undo this terrible damage . " " I forbid it , " said Dr. Schaefer , his voice breaking into a huskiness . " It would he criminal to deprive this young lady of her child-bearing capabilities ' That 's what he wants to do ! It will be murder ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , " it will be murder , Indeed . But I wo n't he the one who committed it . I wo n't remove the Mena If it is possible to let it remain , Jeff . I 'll have to see . The choices a desperate , and I know it only too well . Hortense may die , either on the operating table or a few hours later  --  or she will die without lha operetkn  --  or she will live , after the operation , unable to bear children in the future . The choices are not mine . " " ' There 's no other alternative ? " " The very faintest one , that she will live after the operation and he able to bear other rluldrrr- , The very faintest inc . I ca n't give you any  | hope . It would be cruel to do it . I can only offer you my knowledge and my promise that I will do all I can , all that any man can do . " Dr. Schaefer again appealed to the parents . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's new ' and superficial knowledge ? Do you want a ? " He stopped . But the parents knew what he had almost said . " I do n't know , I do n't know ! " the mother wailed , clinging to her husband . Jonathan sighed and looked at his watch . " Each minute that goes lessens Hortense 's chances . Give me your answer , Jeff . It 's all in your hands . " Dr. Bedloe put his hand on the mother 's shoulder . " You 've heard , Julie . It is n't in your hands . I know Jon Ferrier . Yes , " he added , in a tone of deep shame , " I know him . I wronged him , Julie . I , too , was afraid of him because he knew more , and I hated him for that reason , too . " Jonathan 's black eyebrows raised themselves in somber mockery . " Well , Jeff ? " " I give my permission , " said the young man . " Where 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake , hurry ! " He signed the paper , the pen shaking in his fingers . " You have condemned that child to death , " said Dr. Schaefer . " No , you did , " said Jonathan , folding the paper . " But I 'll try to save her from your judgment of execution . " He looked at Robert who followed him out of the room . In the corridor Jonathan began to race and Robert ran after him . Once in the scrub room the young men began to wash their hands , over and over , and over and over , while the skeptical nurses stood silently by exchanging meaningful glances . Now Jonathan seemed to relax . " Old Bedloe 's a hack and he 's always known it . Now he admits it . That 's like the sun rising west . There may be some hope for him . How did I get myself into this , anyway ? Hortense is n't my patient . Kick me , Bob , kick me hard . " " Do you think there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . Will my horses win at Belmont in September ? I can answer that as easily as I can answer your question . Did n't they teach you at Johns Hopkins that a doctor never asks , nor answers , such a question ? If they did n't , then I will immediately lose respect for them . Come on , another soaping . Seventeen times , remember . Must be something cabalistic about that , do n't you think ? " Then Robert knew that he was deliberately relaxing himself , making himself objective , detached , before facing the ordeal in the operating room . Jonathan confirmed this at once by saying , " The patient has one  | thing in her favor . She 's very young , and youth often confounds physicians . " Hortense Nolan had become " the patient " to him now and Robert felt an easing of the tension in his own shoulders . " Did I ever tell you the story about the old goat of a surgeon and a student nurse ? " asked Jonathan , resoaping his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young nurses nearby , to tell a most lewd story , with suggestive gestures of dripping fingers , gestures which only extreme innocence could not have understood . Robert glanced at the nurses , who had bent their heads sternly , and he laughed loudly . " It 's an old story , " said Jonathan , pleased . " You mean you did n't hear it in your grand Johns Hopkins ? " " ' They were careful of our delicate sensibilities , " said Robert . " I low nice , " said Jonathan . " And I suppose they never told you that some nurses might have the clap , too ? " " They implied it , " said Robert . The nurses shifted indignantly on their feet . Capped , gloved , gowned and masked , the two doctors entered the operating room , which was brilliantly and blindingly lighted from overhead . It smelled of whitewash and soap and ether and carbolic acid . Dr. Bedloe and Dr. Hedler and the two interns were already waiting for them , dressed like themselves . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose bright hair was wrapped in a towel and who seemed pathetically small and already dead on the operating table . " That 's about the best thing you do , Humphrey , " said Jonathan , his voice muffled behind the mask . " You learned one thing , anyway . Oxygen ready , too ? " He looked at the nurses , searching for one infringement of the asepsis technique . He looked carefully at the instrument tray , glittering under the lights . " I assume , " he said , " that these have been sterilized ? " " Jon , " said Louis Hedler , " do n't you think that 's enough levity ? " " Oh , I 'm full of jokes , " said Jonathan , nodding to the nurse nearby . " Solution of carbolic first . That 's right , dear . Now , swab the operating field with alcohol , and I hope it 's alcohol and somebody has n't drunk it and substituted water . " * The nurse at the instillment tray laid a scalpel in Jon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The actual operations never disturlwtl him , for he had assisted at many and performed over a score of the simpler ones . Itut to him , still , the fragile outlining , with  | the scalpel , on the white flesh , and the thin red wake that followed , make his heart quake with dread . It seemed to him that only a sadist could be so unconcerned at the first violation of the human body ; the very delicacy of the first strokes appeared cruel and gloating . " Did I ever tell anyone here the joke about the elderly matron who thought she was pregnant ? " asked Jonathan , as the nurses moved closer with sponges and sutures . " Yes , " said Dr. Hedler . " Last week . Most improper . " The tension in the operating room increased . Now everyone was silent , but the interns dutifully took notes . Dr. Bedloe 's forehead had taken on a livid tint , for he was remembering that it was he who had called Jonathan . He watched without a movement ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instruments clicked in and out of his hand , " There 's one thing certain , now . The infection has spread to the endometrium . And look at this abscess of the uterine wall ! Thank God it 's walled-off . We hardly ever see that . That 's youth , for you , and a good sturdy constitution . We 'll evacuate it . We 'll put in tubes for drainage . No salpingitis or parametritis , thank God again . How did this child escape that , after old Emil 's efforts to kill her ? More sponges ; counting them , I hope ? Tie off this artery , Bob , or are you a statue ? Come on , come on , move faster ! Where 's that Johns Hopkins ' technique ? " The minutes moved on . Dr. Bedloe said , " I do n't like this , Jon . Her pulse is weakening . Her pressure is down , 92/ITo . " His voice trembled . " She is n't just having her tonsils out , " said Jonathan . Sweat was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a nurse wiped the uncovered portions of his face . He looked at the clock ticking ominously away on the wall . Nearly an hour . " The blood loss , " said Dr. Hedler . " I know , I know , " said Jon . " Quick ! This spurt . Damn you , Bob , move faster ! " " I think she 's going , " said Dr. Bedloe . Jonathan said , " Look at old Emil 's infernal sutures ! No wonder . And , as I suspected , placental remnants . Someone should cut his throat , and it would give me great pleasure ? " Dr. Bedloe started the oxygen . " How much longer ? " he implored . " I have to try to bring her out , Jon . " " Go on , then . It 's one way or the other . " His hands flew . He probed and cleaned , sewed . " Anyway , the uterus is all right now . Did I ever tell you ? ? " The girl on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hortense , " said Jonathan . " Stay with me , darling . Bob , you can start tailoring now . "  | Robert found his hands shaking . The girl 's pulse and heart rate and pressure were all increasing , and her belly was beginning to tense . " Ether ! " said Jonathan . " Not much , but enough to relax the belly , damn it ! " He watched critically as Robert made his neat stitches . " Good , " he said . He did not look at his patient . He appeared to be concentrating on Robert 's work . " I 'll have to give her oxygen again , " said Dr. Bedloe . " All right . Do it . Watch that flap there , Bob . Girls , you have all the sponges , I hope ? " His hands were bloody , and his clothing . He stood and watched and only his eyes seemed alive , watching everything , darting from the girl 's face and then to Robert 's hands . Hortense groaned again , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still well under , " said Jonathan . " Do n't wet your trousers , Humphrey . She 's still relaxed . Do n't give too much oxygen for a couple of minutes . " It was two hours before Hortense Nolan was wheeled away into strict isolation , far from the obstetrical floor , and accompanied by nurses who would attend no one else . The four doctors , unaccompanied now by the blatantly admiring interns , went to the sitting room of Hortense 's former suite . The girl 's parents and husband were waiting , and they started with simultaneous cries to their feet . " Where 's my child ? " exclaimed the mother , staring at them with dread . " Why did n't you bring her back ? " Her hands flew to her mouth . She dared not ask the question . Jonathan said , " She 's in an isolated room now . She ca n't come back to this floor . Jeff ? Now listen to me , all of you . She has a chance ; just a chance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if old Emil is permitted in her room , with his own nice little infection and his nice old curious hands . If you let him in , even for a second , I 'm off the case . Is that understood , clearly understood ? " Jeffrey Nolan had begun to cry . The parents clutched each other . Jonathan 's exhausted eyes smiled at them . " A chance , " he repeated . " lust a chance . I would n't bet too much on it , but you can hope a little . And , there 's another thing . If she lives  --  I still say , if she lives ? she 'll have other children , but why anyone would want to inflict life on an innocent soul I do n't know . It 's one of those unsolved mysteries that always plague me . " " Jon , " said I ) r. ikdlne , and took the younger man 's hand . " I ca n't tell you " Do n't , " said Jonathan . " Jon , " said Dr. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " Oh , God , " said Jonathan . " Spare us all that , Louis . If any doctor is allowed in here when I 'm away , he must be either Moe Abrams or Bob here or Jed Collins . No one else . Is that understood , too ? " Dr. Hedler , who looked like a very pallid toad indeed , smiled painfully . " All right , Jon . You do n't have to insult us . Is it really necessary ? " " Very , " said Jonathan . " I did n't go through all that to have some hack undo it all . I know you 're nice old fellows , but I do n't want you in the room with Hortense . Strict asepsis at all times . Me , Abrams , Collins . Yes , and Bob here . He is careful to wash his hands . He 's heard all about Lister and Semmelweis . It might be an excellent idea to read about them someday , Louis . " " We observe absolute asepsis and sterilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , that is very lovely . But the fact still remains that in spite of all that men like old Emil have access to ' the delivery rooms and the obstetrical floor . What do all the precautions mean when one single man can ruin it in a single moment ? " Dr. Hedler hesitated . He looked at Dr. Bedloe . " I think , " he said , " that we 'll take away Emil 's privileges . Remove him from the staff . " Jonathan smiled . " If I 've accomplished nothing else today thank God I accomplished that . Some poor girls will live rather than die , though what the hell anyone wants to live for I do n't know . If there 's any whiskey or brandy in the house , bring it . Jeff and Julie and Horace need it , or we 'll have other patients on our hands . " Jeffrey followed him to the door and tried to speak . " Now , now , " said Jonathan . " Save all your strength for your prayers , Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger . We wo n't be sure for at least two more days . Pray , Jeff . " CHAPTER TEN The two young doctors went to see Hortense before leaving the hospital . She was rapidly coming out from the anesthetic . Jonathan took her pulse , nodded silently to himself . Young Dr. Abrams was sitting nearby . " She opened her eyes once , " he said . " Doctor , I want to tell you that never have I seen such a wonderful ? " " Nonsense , " said Jonathan . " You 're just an intern , Moe . You 'll see much better , And much worse . How 's Mrs. Nolan 's blood pressure ? " " Excellent . Almost normal . I wo n't leave her , Doctor , until Jed can relieve me . We 're going to take turns , as you ordered . " " And no one must come in , not her husband , not her parents , not  | another doctor except Dr. Morgan , or intern , until I give the word . And watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Are n't we the cock of the walk ? " said Robert . " Who runs this hospital ? You ? " " I 'd love to . For a couple of months . Old Louis would be the first out on his ass . Poor old swine . I do n't envy you taking my place on the staff , Bob . There 'll be times when you 'll wish I 'd absent-mindedly used a scalpel on his throat in the operating room . " The deep purple twilight was all about them on the busy street . Jonathan lighted a cigarette . " Stinking things , " he said . " But I do n't have the strength just yet to struggle with my pipe . In a way I 'm sorry for old bungling Emil . " " ' Doctors must always close ranks , ' " said Robert , lighting his own pipe . Jonathan laughed . It was a faint and exhausted sound . " Yes , we must , must n't we ? What if our patients saw us as we are ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet ? I ought to have told you . It was Mrs. Winters ' . Her children had put it up for sale . " Robert paused for just a moment . Then he said with firmness , " Yes , I have settled on it . " " Good . They wanted fifteen thousand but I beat them down to ten . For you . Good night . But go in to see Hortense before midnight . This is your first case , Bob . " The July night was hot and very still . Jonathan rode his horse slowly and wearily homeward . His eyes felt full and aching and his hands were faintly trembling . He had long ago learned to be objective about his cases , but sometimes he could not push them from his mind . He was less certain about Hortense than he had appeared . The chance of her surviving , the chance of the infection having been halted , were very poor . It was now , he thought , in God 's hands , as they say . And I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 've seen them really do when He 's in the mood . The streets of the town seemed full of clinging steam and the gutters were pungent , and the drains . The gaslamps were haloed with rainhowed rings . Jon could hear the rattle of wheels on cobblestones , the sound of laughter in dark alleys , disembodied voices on porches . I l.unbledon 's odors appeared both nostalgic and too heavy to Jonathan Ferrier . 1Ie could smell the river , fishy in the heat , and the sweetness of linden trees and the almost anesthetizing fragrance of full-blown roses and the dust on the grass . Footsteps and the clatter of horses ' hoofs echoed in the hot night . Doors opened , shut , hanged closed . Somewhere there was a thin singing of a gramophone , the distant shout of a young boy , the cry of a child , the call of an anxious mother in the  | dark ; the giggle of a girl . It was all about him but he felt himself unseen , unheard , unknown . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places , alone and silent . It was well . Soon he would be gone and it would be as if he had never lived . He looked toward the mountains and they were only deeper shadows against a dim sky faintly sparkling with stars . He looked at the houses he passed and saw the yellow light against blinds or caught a glimpse of a small parlor and nondescript furniture , and men in shirtsleeves reading under lamps or a mother rocking a baby , or children at tables playing dominoes . He , Jonathan Ferrier , saw it all but now it was strange and remote and he had no part in it . He had no home here . He had no one . Dear Mavis , he thought . I should have killed you , nice and quietly , long ago . He passed the swinging doors of saloons and heard the raucous laughter in their noxious depths . He was thirsty . He wanted a cold beer . He remembered that it had been many hours since he had eaten anything . He pulled up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intersection and saw the distant square with its iron statue of General Sherman . It looked like a dream or a painted scene and not reality at all . The gaslights blinked and shifted . He went on and now as he approached the section where he lived it seemed a little cooler and the air was fresher and there was a small breeze from the river . The houses became larger and more isolated on dark lawns , and half hidden behind clusters of trees . His ancestors had known and had helped build this town but he had no part in it and never would again . He was growing more tired every moment . When he reached the stables where he kept his town horses he could hardly drop down from the saddle and lift his bag . One of the stableboys came to him eagerly . " Good evening , Dr. Ferrier ! My , this horse looks tuckered out . " " He is . " Jonathan watched the horse being led away . Soon he would not ride this horse . He would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not know . He hoped not . He ought to sell all but one , and keep that one for his mother , who loved it . He would give the matter thought tomorrow . He glanced up the street and saw the dark Winters ' house where Robert and his mother would live , and between his house and the Winters ' one he saw his offices , unlighted , silent . He had little more to do there . In fact , he had little more to do with living at all . He thought of the whiskey in his offices , and hesitated . Then he went up the long walk to his house , and the shadows of the trees fell over him and these old familiar creatures did not belong to him any longer , either . The house was old and strong and high and broad and long and there were lights in a few windows . His grandfather had added this huge  | porch which extended all about the house . The porch was secluded and resembled a colonnade , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on rainy days he had played with his brother or had sat alone , listening or reading , or talking with his father . What had they talked about ? He did not remember . His father 's voice came back to him , grave , thoughtful , musing . But damned if he could remember one single thing his father had said on all those days , through the years ! It was very odd , however , that he could recall almost all that his mother had said to him briefly , on the few occasions she had talked to him on this porch . Jonathan stood there now , looking down the long shadowy reaches of the deserted boards and the still chairs and tables in the faint light that came through the windows and from the far-distant street lamp . It was on a hot summer dusk that she had said to him somewhat sternly , " You really must stop laughing at Harald . You do n't know how you hurt him . " He had been fifteen then . And it was on an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had paused here . It had been raining all day and now the whispering sound of it was on the air , rustling mysteriously through new leaves and a wind was sighing down the long porch , which was empty . Then he had heard a sound of sobbing , dismal and faint , and he had turned and walked a short distance down the porch , which echoed with his footsteps in the fragrant half light , and he had found Harald , then twelve years old , crouched on the floor with his head and right shoulder pressed against the brick wall of the house . He had lifted his head at Jonathan 's approach and had stopped his sobbing , but he still crouched there desolately . Jonathan said , " What the hell are you doing here , crying like a baby ? " Harald did not answer for a moment or two , and then he said , " Father laughed at one of my paintings . He said I had no talent . " Jonathan knew his father 's taste in painting . He liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even then Jonathan had to admit it , sentimental and obvious subjects . He particularly liked , for instance , a painting called " The Storm , " which depicted an overfed youth , all Ilyacinthine curls , racing against a background of velvety dusk with a maiden with large plump legs and daintily disposed garments and flowing hair . The youth had arranged a big cloak over the maiden 's brad and it billowed with silken highlights . Jonathan had not liked it , but he slid not know why . A good , and expensive , copy of it had " waved " the living-room mantel until Adrian Ferrier 's death  --  when Marjorie had removed it . Jonathan had said bluntly to his brother , " I do n't know if you have any talent . Put I do know that Father does n't have any . " Ilarald had caught his breath , and then had slowly risen to his feet .  | He tried to see Jonathan in the wet gloom . " Do you mean that , Jon ? Honestly , do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're such a baby ! Crying out here , as if it 's important . If you have talent it will show . That 's all it should mean to you . If you start listening to people , and their advice , you 'll never amount to anything . " " Do n't you listen ? " Harald had come closer to him and Jonathan had felt his ardent intensity , and he had stepped back with distaste . " Never , " Jonathan had said with total firmness . " That is , I only listen to people who know what they 're talking about . " " But how can you tell ? " " Instinct , kid , instinct . " And Jonathan had walked away and left him . He stood alone on this hot July night , completely exhausted and beset , and he remembered that rainy twilight and Harald 's shadowy look of hope . It was certainly strange how things returned to a man when he least expected them , and when his defenses were down . " Instinct , " he repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most needed it ? Where is it now ? " He opened the hall door and went inside . The hall was long and wide and beautifully proportioned and the ceiling was high . It was Marjorie who had painted the dark wood in her favorite shade of pale gray with soft silver moldings , and it was she who had removed the heavy old dark furniture and had replaced it with graceful pieces exquisitely arranged : A marble console with a tall thin mirror on one side , two Louis XIV gilt chairs with white velvet upholstery , a sofa , and a table of the same period hearing an exquisite marble statuette of a faun and a lamb . The curving stairs at the rear had also been painted gray and were carpeted with blue plush in a dim shade . Marjorie had removed the wall lamps and had hung a majestic crystal chandelier , arranged for gas , from the ceiling . A few of the lamps were lighted now , and threw a golden shadow down on the Aubusson rug which was colored in shades of misty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here but tranquillity and space and unobtrusive hues and silence . Marjorie came through a door at the left of the graceful stairway , and her thin silk dress in a tint of mauve rustled as she moved . She smiled but her hazel eyes were anxious . " Dear Jon , " she said , " I was worried about you . Why , you look so tired . " She glanced down at his hands . She saw they were red and the skin appeared dry and so she knew he had been operating  --  a thing he had sworn never to do again in Hambledon . He saw her glance and he said , " Yes . I did , and I still do n't know why . Do n't ask me who ; I 'll tell you later . " She came to him and kissed him on the cheek and she saw how weary he was and how ghastly his color . She said , " I 've waited dinner for you ,  | of course . And , " she paused a second , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you must have a drink before dinner . " " Thank you , " he said . " I 'll go upstairs and wash and change . " " Oh , do n't change . Do you know how romantic you look in riding clothes ? " She smiled again . " I never saw another man who looked so in jodhpurs and boots . Just freshen . I 'll wait for you in the living room . " Her smile was still fixed as she watched him go upstairs . He walked heavily and slowly and he ( lid not look back . His dark head was bent . She sighed , tightened her hands together and went out of the hall . She sat down in the large parlor and never had it seemed so empty before to her and so lonely . As a bride and a very young matron she had again used her taste here , removing the ponderous and frowning furniture and introducing the delicacy of an earlier age , including painted walls in a silvery shade and a dimmed Oriental rug that almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the despised " Storm " had once hung , and the white and carved fireplace had no fire and only a basket of pale yellow roses which filled the room with a Cool scent of tea . The silken draperies at the tall windows were the color of the roses and they fell about long lengths of weblike imported lace . The windows were slightly ajar , and the hot wind moved them . Now Marjorie , waiting for her son , could hear thunder prowling among the mountains and she saw a flash of lightning . There will be a storm , she thought vaguely . She had been so listless all day , and her head had ached , and she thought , now , I 'm really very tired of living . I wo n't be able to stand it when Jon leaves . He must n't leave . Yes , I suppose he must . It 's too dangerous for him here , too dangerous for ? Her mind fluttered away in fear . She looked at the silent and shimmering furniture , at the Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs in white and yellow , at all the crystal and marble and silver and at the gilded buhl cabinets which sheltered her collections of china and objets d'art , and it seemed to her that no one had ever lived here and no one ever would . The restless pain in her heart was not totally physical ; it was like a rat gnawing in the dark under her breast . There were a cook and a maid in the kitchen , but they were far distant behind thick doors . Marjorie could hear nothing in the breathless silence but is surly grumbling among the mountains . Not even the trees stirred in that slight and burning wind . She thought of the empty bedrooms upstairs on the second floor . Two only were used , hers and Jon 's , and isn't. she had anticipated the sound of grandchildren there . But there would be no grauu ( children . Jonathan would never marry again , and Harald lived , a widower , on that fo ) Iish island and dared not leave it for more than five months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not *  | domestic staff slept on the third floor and they went up a hack staircase and had their own living quarters . How could she , Marjorie , endure it here alone after Jonathan went away , the only living thing on the second floor , the only tenant of these great rooms , the only person to walk the gardens or watch the snow fill up the trees ? She did not think of her dead husband . His ghost would not keep her company . She started when someone took her wrist firmly , and she said , " Jon ! I did n't hear you come in . " But he was counting her pulse and scowling a little . " Heat too much for you ? " he asked , laying her hand down on the arm of the chair . " A little . Will you mix me a drink also ? " Jonathan went to the silver tray on a marble table . He poured a large amount of whiskey into one glass , added only a little soda , then poured a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable quantity of soda . He brought the latter to his mother . Then standing , he drank deeply of his tall crystal glass as if he could not swallow the liquid fast enough . He had almost drained the glass before he took it from his mouth . He smiled down at his mother , then seated himself . Marjorie kept her face carefully bland . " I cooked the dinner for you tonight , Jon . But I 'm afraid it 's very heavy on a night like this . Wiener schnitzel ; you always liked it . " " I still do . But you should n't have bothered . " " It 's no bother . " She moved restlessly . " I do hope it 'll be nice on the Fourth . Whom shall we invite  --  it 's very late now  --  for our usual picnic ? " " I 've already invited Bob Morgan , and his mother . I know . She 's all whalebone , flatus and fraudulent copperplate . " Marjorie sipped at her glass . " And I 've invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rose and Albert Kitchener , and their daughter , Maude . She 's such a nice girl , and so very pretty and talented , and intelligent . Such beautiful eyes and curly auburn hair , and a delightful figure . " " For Harald ? " " No , dear . Harald left today for Philadelphia . What a bad memory I have ! Did n't I tell you that he is to have a show in Philadelphia on the fifth ? He 's already shipped twenty canvases . You know that private and very exclusive gallery on Broad Street ? Yes . " " Yes , " said Jonathan . He stood up and filled his glass again . " It will cost him a nice penny . " " He can afford it . And the owner has been advertising for two weeks , and issued invitations and there has been such a wonderful acceptance . It will be very successful . " " Why did n't you go , too ? " " Oh , I do n't know . I 've gotten out of the habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives are dead now , and it makes me feel very sad , and I was a reserved sort of girl and did n't make many friends . Many of them have moved away . I should have gone , I suppose . " " And you did n't want to leave me alone on the Fourth . " " Well , dear , it would have been lonely for you . " She looked at him . " I also invited Jenny . " " What ? Without Harald ? " " Jon . Please do n't sneer . It makes you look quite ugly and you are really a very handsome man . Yes , you are . " Jonathan said in a mocking and musing voice , " Childe Harald . I do n't understand his impressionistic style , but he may be good at that . I ie'Il shock the hell out of Philadelphia , and so I wish him well . How did you shuck Jenny from that island ? " his mother was watching him very carefully again . " I just invited her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . She 'd mourn for our Harald . It 's a wonder he did n't pack her up and take her with him . " " Jon , dear . Is it possible that you do n't know that Jenny  --  dislikes ? Harald ? Are you that blind ? You know very well that she grimly stays on that island because it is her home , and her father built that house , and she adored him , and she regards Harald as an impudent intruder . She wo n't let him have it alone . She just sits and stands there , waiting for the day when he wo n't come back again . " " Oh , Mother . I do n't believe that for a minute . She stays there because of our Harry . " " You really do believe the gossip of the town , Jon ? Oh , no , you simply ca n't ! You , above all ! Jon , Harald wants to marry Jenny . He told me so , himself . " ' The glass became very still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone . Marjorie watched her son 's dark face and heavy brows and hidden eyes with great intentness . " IIarry ? He wants to marry Jenny ? " " Yes . I ie 's asked her dozens of times . " " I do n't believe it , " he said . " I 've been there very often , and I 've wutrhrd her . She stares at him as if she 's  --  hungry . She listens to every word he says as if it came from God . She follows him all around with those big blue eyes of hers . She is n't aware of anyone else when he 's around . Its not just the town gossip . I would n't consider that for an instant . But I 've seen Jenny  --  booking at Childe Harald . And I 'm acutely sensitive to people ; I have to be . When he moves near her she actually trembles . And she waits . She 's a woman in love . " Yes , thought Marjorie . But she said , " Jenny is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to say it , you really do n't know much about women , and especially not about young women . " " No , " he said . " You are quite correct . I did n't know . " He was thinking of Mavis . His mother saw the clenching of his facial muscles . He stood up as if to hide from her and again refilled his glass . Her anxiety came back to her , sharper than ever . He stood by the table and his face was turned away from her . " You ought to have provided me with sisters . " " Well , it 's too late for that , I 'm afraid . " Marjorie smiled painfully . Jon did not look at her . " Dear , " she said , " if Jenny does as you say , it is because she hates Harald . She 's watching him all the time . I even think she is afraid of him , in a way . I think she thinks ? " " What ? " He sauntered back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if anything ? " But Marjorie sipped at her glass . " What she thinks of Harald is wrong . I ca n't tell you what she told me . It  --  it is probably just her imagination . She 's so young and she 's always been so secluded , and girls have fantasies . " " She certainly has a fantasy about our Harry . Mother , I may not know all the mysterious thoughts that flitter around a girl 's head like bats and butterflies , but I do know a woman in ? " But she said with quietness , " In passion , Jon ? Most probably . But in love , Jon ? I do n't think you could ever detect that ! " " I do n't want to . I doubt most women could love , anyway . They do n't have the capacity . It 's all frivolity to them , and pretentious houses and clothes and jewelry and teas . " He waved his hand . " And darling little children and places in society and mean little ambitions . Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " did you love my father ? " The pallor about Marjorie 's mouth increased . She said , " I thought I did . In the beginning . Then , I did n't . It took a long time . " " Well , what did happen to all that love ? " " Jon , do you want me to tell you ? " " Yes , now that we 're in a romantic and melting mood . " " Very well . Your father was n't very intelligent , Jon . I know that hurts you to hear that . You loved him so much . And he loved you dearly and always wanted you near him . I do n't think he cared about anyone else , especially not Harald . I was just , eventually , the gracious mistress of his house . Jon ? Does that hurt you very much ? " He went back to his chair . There was a dull flush on his cheekbones . He considered his mother for a long hard moment . " My father was kind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's so damned little of it in this world . If a man is kind he should be celebrated . " " He was n't kind to Harald . "  | " Because Harald is a fool . " " Why ? " " He listened to my father . He had a way of trailing him . " " Yes , I know . Poor Harald . " " Was n't he kind to you ? It seems to me he was the soul of consideration . " " He never saw me , really , after you were born , Jon . " " Were you jealous ? " He smiled at her incredulously and with amusement . " No . I 'd long given up caring . " He considered that . Then he said , " If he was such a fool , as you seem to think , then he 'd have been devoted to Harald . " " But he never knew he was  --  a fool  --  and that makes a difference . " " A fool . What was he to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It seems odd to say that so distinguished a man , and so aristocratic , had many , many pretensions . " " To what ? " " To taste . To intelligence . To worldliness . To cosmopolitanism . He was really naive . And naivete in a mature man is n't so beguiling , Jon . Except to superficial people , and I 'm not superficial . He could talk eloquently ; he knew poetry , he thought . He had a wide acquaintance with literature and art and music . Yet , he never felt them at all , where it matters . One thinks that only the vulgar are pretentious . But the pseudo-cultured , vaguely feeling some inadequacy , are desperate to be considered more sensitive than they are . " She sighed : " It 's very pathetic , in an ordinary man , to struggle to be more than he is , and your father struggled . It was wretched for me to know that , and I was so sorry . When he saw he could n't impress me any longer he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame him . I should have been more tolerant , but I was n't . " " And you probably think these things about your sons , too . " " Jon , do n't sound so hard and unforgiving . " The dinner bell chimed softly , and Marjorie rose and Jon with her . Once he staggered a little . " I only know this , " he said , " you were closer t ' , I tarald than to me , and yet you imply that Harald is more like my father . Inconsistent . Are you coming ? " Neither Marjorie nor Jonathan was notable for loquacity even when they felt no strain between them , merely passing pleasant remarks or none at all during the hours they dined together . In this Marjorie had once rellectrd , Jonathan resembled herself . Harald was more like his father ; they both liked conversation . It was as if words protected them in some manner , kept a bright and defensive barrier between  | them and what it was they had always feared . What had they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was considered unpardonable even to speculate about those deep and hidden sanctuaries of the human spirit in others , and worse even to comment about them . The retreats of a beloved child , or wife or husband , were inviolate and it was indefensible to assault them . It was the lowest vulgarity and outrage of all , it was a Peeping Tom voyeurism engaged in only by the obscene of heart . Therefore , if Adrian Ferrier had obviously feared others  --  though Marjorie admitted that it was wise to fear your fellowman to some extent  --  the fear had been out of proportion , invariably , to his routine run of living and circumstance . But then , she had thought , we always turn a facade to others behind which we watch and wait , hope or fear , love or hate , pray or curse . That is our privacy , that facade . We all have our individual approach to the world , and if Adrian fears that is his particular response to life , and no stranger than belligerence , suspicion , amiability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or charity . Even animals have their particular reaction to their immediate life and environment , and none is the same as another 's . Tonight , as they ate their dinner together and drank their wine , Marjorie and Jonathan were unusually silent even for them . The thunderstorm had burst out from its lair beyond the mountains and was assaulting the small city and the river with fire and great explosions . Mother and son were not aware of it . Marjorie was already regretting that she had so violated her code as to speak intimately of her dead husband to Jonathan . It was disgraceful . She had held her husband 's secret  --  which he had never guessed she knew just as he had lived unaware that there was anything at all to guess about him  --  to herself alone . To reveal Adrian as he had been , even to his son , was particularly shameful , and she was disgusted and appalled at herself . She recalled every word she had said . What had been the matter with her , to descend to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strain , which were not ending but only mounting , and the dread in which she lived and the daily terror , and the obvious decay of Jonathan and his increasing addiction to drinking , and the wild beast which he denied existed but which was mangling him . And Harald , too , and Jenny . The world was full of menace . Of course , she reflected , it always had been full of menace , for it was a mysterious and dangerous place despite all the songs of its " wonder " and sweetness and " love , " and all its ridiculous slogans concerning the " progress of man , " but its threat remained faceless until it entered one 's own house . Then , as the door opened to admit it , one saw the abyss just beyond the garden , the innocent , lying garden . She saw that Jonathan 's exhaustion appeared to be growing . His color  | was extremely bad , the sallowness accentuated . He was drinking the good wine not with pleasure but with grim absent-mindedness . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not very long ago , nor who had so suffered . That was not unusual ; he rarely mentioned his cases . But Marjorie saw that he had totally forgotten who had lain unconscious under his hands that day , and this was indeed unusual for him . She wanted to say to him , " Forgive me for telling you what I knew about your father . I have no excuse ; it was degrading of me . Why did I tell you ? I do n't know , my dear . I never told anyone else . Malice did n't inspire me , nor indifference , nor dislike . I liked your father as a person to the day he died , and was often fond of him . I still do n't know why I told you . It was very wrong , for you loved him dearly and believed in him . " I Icr thought suddenly stopped as she remembered that Jonathan had had no objection at all to her removing the absurd and stylized painting of " The Storm " after Adrian had died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet been twenty-three ? " I 've always despised that thing . It 's ridiculous and pretentious and a dozen other things , though I suppose our Harald would call it well-drawn . " Marjorie put down her coffee spoon in surprise , and stared at Jonathan who sat in his father 's place in the thunder-vibrating soft light and subdued glitter and pale elegance of the dining room . Certainly , Jonathan had said that , and how strange of her not to have remembered . It had been Harald who had always laughed at " The Storm , " but not Jonathan . Adrian had disliked Shakespeare and had read poetry to Jonathan by the hour in his secluded library , but it had been Keats and Whitman and Emily Dickinson and Wordsworth and Browning and Tennyson and Longfellow  --  particularly Longfellow . He had read prose to Jonathan from the latter 's earliest childhood , but it had been Dickens and never Thackeray , Dumas never Zola . There had been plays , too , but Sheridan never Moliere or Gounod ? and , hack to the poets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitman but not Milton . Music was his particular adoration , he would say , but he preferred Mozart to Wagner , Schubert to Beethoven , Liszt to I ; arh . In short , he had lacked an awareness of grandeur and terror . It was as if they had been only alien words to him , accepted in the dittion:uy and in books but never in reality . It was Jonathan who loved Shakespeare , Milton , Chaucer , Moliere , ( ; ouncxl , and the mighty Teutonic composers . It was Jonathan who , even as a child , had glimpsed the abysses of life and rarely the gardens , who had known the terror of living and the presence of evil . His father had toll him nothing of these , yet he had known . Why , then , had he so loved his father and had resentfully turned away from The most  | amiable , if jesting , remark his mother had made about him ? Marjorie nodded to the girl who assisted the cook and accepted ftesh tea . Jon had not touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his face was exceptionally gloomy even for him and exceptionally closed . There was a glaze over his eyes . He was almost drunk . His food was congealing on his plate , and the thunder drummed against the tall and shining glass of the windows and the lightning illuminated them at frequent intervals . I know , thought Marjorie with sadness . He considered Adrian a child , even when he was a child , himself , and he thought he must protect him from his family and from living . But perhaps more than anything else he thought that Adrian was kind , and Jonathan has always been particularly vulnerable to kindness in others , because even as a child he knew that kindness , true kindness , was a very rare thing in this world , and he could not bear the knowing . Poor child . What had Father McNulty said of him only a few months ago ? " Jon is not really a complex man , Mrs. Ferrier . Once I thought so , but now I know that is not true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching way possible . He appears complicated to people , and ambiguous , because he is not a liar , and is n't that a terrible commentary on people and unworthy of a priest ? But , it is true . The devious man is always spoken of by his friends as being candid ' and frank , ' whereas the exact reverse is correct . People just ca n't believe simplicity like Jon 's . It 's labyrinthine to them and I 'm afraid that is a sad comment on the state of human nature . Jon just is , and no one accepts a man for what he shows the world . Men believe that others , like themselves , are always hiding . But Jon never turned a false face and a lying one to his fellowman . He has the attribute of both the saint and the simpleton  --  he is himself . And that is the cause of his misery , and probably the cause of his unhappiness as a child , as you have told me yourself . That is why he can not accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgiveness is not in him . " Marjorie had had to agree , after some thought . " And he does n't know what fear is , " she had said . " True , " said Father McNulty . " The man who is utterly himself before the world , without guile and cruelty and artfulness , thinks he has nothing to fear . But he has . He has his fellowman . I 'm afraid Jon is beginning to suspect that he should fear , but he rejects the very idea . He could n't live in a world of fear ; it would choke him . He did n't fear the judge and the jury because , in his simplicity , he believed that lack of guilt would prove itself overwhelmingly . The wounds he carries now are the result of the actions and words of others against him , and he ca n't forgive them . "  | " And why should he ? " Marjorie had asked with deep bitterness . Jonathan had never confided in her in all his life but twice , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two events . Was it possible , she thought tonight as she sipped her tea , that he instinctively understood that only she would understand his indictments of humanity and that his father would not ? The first incident had been when he was nine years old . He was leaving his school grounds when he saw several large boys tormenting a smaller one , a sniveling , disliked , groveling boy , advertising his apprehension of his mates at all times , and his frightened desire to placate them so that they would not hurt him . Marjorie knew the boy and his parents , and had once asked Jonathan why he was not kind to the lad . " He is such a measly coward , " Jonathan had replied with scorn , and yet with pity . But , on that wintry day , he had seen the tormenting of the boy and it had enraged him . Without thinking at all  --  and how often did Jonathan even now pause to think of himself ? ? he had lunged at the youths , who were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and his hatred that they could torment one weaker , had given him abnormal strength and fury . He had driven them off a distance and had rescued their victim , who was sniveling and weeping , as usual , and crying for his mother . The momentarily vanquished soon became aware that a single boy was responsible both for denying them their victim and their present smartings , and they advanced on Jonathan like a phalanx and had roughly beaten him up , including blackening his eyes and bloodying his nose . Among his attackers , and the most gleeful , had been the boy he had rescued . When he tore away from his schoolmates , and ran  --  prudently , for Jonathan  --  the loudest and most derisive catcall had come from the lad he had saved from pain and blows . " Why ? " he had asked his mother , standing before her with his thin legs apart and his torn and bruised face both challenging and furious . She had said , " You had become the unpopular minority . " he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't  --  explain why Timmy kicked me , too , and jeered at me . Why did n't he just run away ? Why did he just stay , and  --  and ? " " Make common cause with his enemies ? Against you ? Jonathan , that 's hard to explain to von now . It 's both subtle and ordinary . Human nature is n't a pleasant thing to think about ? " But unfortunutcly Jonathan 's father had just then entered the morning nx ) m and he , after one appalled exclamation of sympathy and astonishment , had swept Jonathan to him and had held him richly to his heart , murmurous and Iu. king . Marjorie had watched and her features , so  | like her son 's , had closed and tightened . She had waited in silence while Jonathan asked his questions of his father . Adrian held the boy on his knee now , and was stroking his head tenderly , and his blue eyes , a little vacant and protruding , were misted . He had stared musingly into space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiant smile ? the one which Marjorie particularly loathed  --  suffused his face like a beaming halo . " It 's very simple , Jonathan , " Adrian had said . " The children are n't yet civilized , gentled . They do n't understand . Children are so dear and so innocent ! So pure , so good . If they do what others consider evil , it really is not evil . It is only lack of understanding , or perhaps wicked teachings from their parents . You must think of them kindly , and forgive and forget , knowing that Man does Progress , and Man does become Good , when reaching maturity . " Marjorie had felt a little sick , as she always did when her husband emphatically and resoundingly affirmed his faith in humanity . Jonathan , on his father 's knee , had looked at him oddly  --  and why had n't she , Marjorie , remembered that either until now ? Then Jonathan had smiled as if at a child who must not be hurt , and then he had given his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak . The thunder seemed to have picked this old and beautiful house for its particular enemy tonight , for there was a stunning crash . Neither Marjorie , sunken in her revery , nor Jon , growing more drunk by the moment , was aware of it . Marjorie was saying to herself , " I was always getting those looks from Jon , but , God forgive me , it was n't until just now that I remember them and understand them . It was always my damned reticence  --  I never explored . I thought it unbecoming and indecent . But still , Jon even as a little boy was always protecting his father . He would have resented it if I had let him know that I , too , knew that his father was a fool . How strange is human nature ! We guard what is least worthy of guarding and leave vulnerable what it is most necessary to protect  --  for our soul 's sake . " Jonathan never spoke of that incident again , but for a long time he would watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and was therefore no longer a danger to her husband and his serene convictions that if one just ignored the ugliness of the world , or smoothed it over with platitudes , it would not exist . He was a coward , and I never knew it until now , thought Marjorie . Or , did I ? Jonathan was a very religious boy . He was also an altar boy . On a few occasions he had spoken seriously of the priesthood . " Oh , not that , " Marjorie , the Protestant , had said with a light laugh before husband and son . " You are n't up to it , Jon . You 'd be the terror of the Confessional  | You 'd have no patience with human nature . You do n't really understand it at all , and you are now fifteen . You hate evil , but you do n't comprehend the causes of evil , and how deep it lies in the human spirit . In ford interno , to use Latin . " Adrian spoke ponderously . " ' In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evil is external to man , not in him . As Rousseau has said ? " " Why do n't you tell that to Father McGuire ? " Marjorie had asked , losing her usual patience . " He would tell you that it is a doctrine of the Church that man is conceived in sin , born in sin , and has no merit of his own and can earn no merit . What merit he has has been given to him by God , and God alone . By himself , he is incapable of being good , or meritorious , incapable of his own salvation  --  because , as Solomon has said , ' Man is wicked from his birth and evil from his youth . ' " " You seem to he well acquainted with the doctrines of the Church , M.ujoric , " Adrian had replied with his heavy irony , " and so I often wonder why you do n't ask to he admitted . By the way , I 've never heard those doctrines , or they are probably now outmoded . Man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when He says that None save God is good ? ' " Adrian was shocked . " I do n't believe that is in the Holy Bible ? " Marjorie nodded , smiling . " Yes , it is . In St. Luke , and you can find it for yourself . It is a strange thing , but I have noticed that at no time did God or His Son ever break into eulogies about the goodness ' of man . On the contrary ! There are constant references in the Bible about the infamy of man and his need for redemption , and his innate evil . But never goodness . " " Nonsense , " said Adrian . His well-colored face , so like Harald 's , had deeply flushed and Marjorie , with sudden compunction , saw that he was afraid . " Did n't a man , recorded in the Holy Bible , say ' Am I my brother 's keeper ? ' A magnificent question ! " " It was asked by Cain , " said Marjorie . " Cain , the murderer , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The silence that had fallen in the room had had a little terribleness in it . Adrian had sat , and now his fright was visible , and he was hating his wife openly . Jon looked at him , and he put his hand on his father 's check , again in that attitude of protection , and Marjorie , for a moment , hail itrit.thly despised her son . There was surely a limit to indulging fools and pretentiousness and ignorance ! She said , " The answer Goil gave to that ' magnificent question ' was , I believe , Your brother 's hlhwMl cries tip to Mr from the ground against you . ' And so it always was , and In It always is . " " You have no pity , Marjorie And there , thought Marjorie tonight , was a perfect example of the  | perfect non sequitur . But people , when concerned in fantasies and sentimentalities , invariably resorted , with hatred and indignation , to it . Jon , that night , at fifteen , had said nothing . But once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by a long hard black stare at her , not to hurt his father . He knew , thought Marjorie , as she touched her napkin to her lips tonight and for once becoming aware of the storm outside , and the growing tension and heat in the long and beautiful dining room , indeed he knew , but he rebelled against my knowing that he knew . He 's still not over his resentment against me for knowing , and for " hurting " his father , and that is part of his trouble . How singleminded he was , and is ! How still he will not accept the obvious ! And there was Harald who had at first accepted his father as Jonathan had accepted him . But not after he was fourteen years old . Thereafter he had known Adrian for exactly what he was ! Was that why Jonathan , even today , disliked him so ? How very contradictory and intricate and secret and manifold mankind was , and how very , very strange ! Jon , in these days , was frequently relieving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even beyond the bounds of decent pity , and he was speaking with cynicism and even hatred . How much of it did he believe himself , or was he speaking in despair and hoping to be refuted ? Or at least hoping that it might be hidden from him , thus permitting him to live again in a little peace ? Or what , or who , was he protecting ? The memory of his father ? Harald , thought Marjorie , with unique surprise , was , in this way , like herself , in that he accepted everything with tolerance and amused understanding and refused to permit the world to make him miserable . If he sometimes spoke in jesting aphorisms , as she did , it was evident that he did it jocularly  --  evident to everyone but Jon . When Jonathan was seventeen he had joined a Hiking League connected with his private secondary school , and had set off with a large group on a walking tour of the state . It lasted two weeks . He returned home , more taciturn than usual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He appeared wretched . Marjorie asked her husband , " Has Jon told you anything about that walking tour ? He does n't seem himself . " " He is perfectly all right , " Adrian had replied with his usual complacent buoyancy . " He had many interesting experiences . Very , very pleasant , and most edifying . " His big blue eyes , as usual , were artless and serene . But then , Marjorie had remarked to herself , Jon really never tells him anything . " Edifying . Yes , " Adrian had continued , with that sweet musing look of his which Marjorie found most infuriating . " We shall look at my Audubon collection tonight and try to identify the birds which Jonathan saw on his very enlightening excursion . Most instructive . "  | Adrian , Marjorie thought with fearful clarity tonight , abandoned me when I finally stopped protecting him , and found him out , and turned to Jon , who fervently received the burden , and who still carries it ! My God , why do n't we see and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Jon get the idea tonight that I " implied " that Harald was very like Adrian ? There is so much of me in Jon and so much of me in Harald , thought Marjorie , tonight . I Lid she been wrong in believing that Harald 's easy conversation , so like his father 's , had risen from fear , as his father 's had so risen ? Or did I larald simply keep up a brighter chatter to fend off the dangerous inquisitiveness of others , because though he liked people he slid not trust them ? Or found them too ridiculous to take seriously ? on was always taking people too seriously , though he would be the first to deny that , with angry contempt . Who was it who had said , " Life is a tragedy to the man who feels , and a comedy to the man who thinks " ? If that was so , then Jon was really a man who " felt " and did not absolutely think , and so Father McNulty was quite correct , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wisdom to be measured solely in years ? Marjorie recalled many who were old who were still fools . She returned to the . memory of when Jonathan had been seventeen . It had been an unusually warm spring for Pennsylvania . Secretly , Marjorie had always worried about Jonathan 's health , for he was overtall for his age , almost emaciated in appearance , and his sallow complexion seemed dimmer . Compared with him , Harald , the full-blooded and well-colored , appeared offensively healthy and hearty and slightly plump , at fifteen . Jonathan seemed to be irritated by Harald 's light and amiable chatter more than customary , and accordingly Harald was brighter than ever and more loquacious and deliberately annoying . He could not restrain his pleasure that Jonathan would be away for two weeks and he made his pleasure obvious . Marjorie could not help smiling at this . Jonathan , she had thought , was really too serious and preoccupied and took his studies with a firm intensity , and he was only seventeen . His temper , never well restrained under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , who almost frantically refused to acknowledge unpleasantness or troublesome matters , said , " My dear , you are always too concerned about Jon . He is fit as a fiddle . Fit as a fiddle , " he repeated , for he loved cliches and found his sanctuary in them . Marjorie thought to ask him , " And what makes a fiddle fit , or what is fitness in a fiddle ? " but she recognized the remark as childish and refrained from it . I.et Adrian have his platitudes and aphorisms and cliches . They protected hint against life and rrainy and so their existence could be endured .  | Jonathan was gone for the two whole weeks and returned thinner than ever , duller of complexion than before , and with a mature darkness on his face which was never to leave it for the rest of his life . Though even for him he was unusually silent Marjorie saw that he was thinking deeply and fiercely , for the white ridges , newly arrived , kept springing out about his mouth . Marjorie could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but his voice , as always when in conversation with Adrian , was agreeable , even soothing . He sounds like a father talking to a child ! Marjorie thought with exasperation , and not for the first time . Adrian 's voice , in reply , was grateful and mellow ? Oh , the damned mellowness of it ! ( She could abide unctuousness , for one knew at once that unctuous men were hypocrites and liars and inclined to be dangerous , and so one was warned , knowing the fraudulence . But mellow-voiced men were either fools or cowards . In a way they were much more dangerous than the unctuous men , for they could easily and disastrously betray , not out of malice or design but out of sheer panic . ) Marjorie waited . Jonathan had not confided in her since he had been nine . She had no hope that he would this time , either . But one morning he came abruptly into her sitting room , where she was discussing the Easter dinner with the cook , and on seeing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instinctively , that Jonathan wished to talk to her and not on an idle matter . But she smiled easily at him and said , " Good morning , dear . Have you had your breakfast ? I see you have your bicycle clips on ; out for a run ? " He sat down opposite her and did not answer . He only stared at her , and she knew that defiant and challenging stare . She folded the newspaper on her knee and put it aside , and said nothing and only waited . He said , with a note of accusation in his boy 's voice , " You are n't the least damned interested in my walking tour , are you ? " She could not help being tart . " You have n't mentioned a word about it , Jon , except for talking to your father , a conversation to which I was not invited . What 's wrong ? Did something disagreeable happen to you ? " He regarded her sullenly and crossed his long thin legs . He folded his arms across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth again . " I do n't see how anything I saw , or did , could interest you . " " You might try , " Marjorie said . " Did it interest your father ? " " I did n't tell him . Yet . But I will . " Marjorie waited again . She did nothing to encourage his confidence . She sat relaxed and handsome , with the morning light on her dark hair and the jet buttons on her severe bodice glittering . The light was full on the wretched boy 's face , but hers was in shadow . Then he told her .  | The rains that spring had been notably heavier than usual , in the southern section where the walking tour had taken place . The company ) f boys , and one of their teachers , could walk only two or three hours t day , and then had to run for shelter to the nearest town or village , loping to encounter a small hotel which was reasonably clean . Some were not too intolerable ; some were chilly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but just the foothills , very muddy and slippery n the almost constant water and the breaking of recently locked springs , : reeks , rivers and brooks . One day they found the narrow road blocked off with a warning ; ign . Part of a small muddy hill had begun to slide , and travelers by ' oot or horse or carriage or wagon were warned to keep off the road for at least a mile in either direction for fear of a landslide . The boys , led by their teacher , cautiously left the road and walked parallel to it at a distance of about a hundred feet , in the meanwhile curiously surveying the brown and leaking and glistening hills on the other side of he road . It was a dreary and monotonous scene against the somber gray sky , and very deserted , for the nearest town was half a mile away and hidden to the west behind another range of hills . Then the teacher shouted and halted and began to point . At a little Distance , and right in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing , for the earth all about was soft and soggy and spongy , Ind the road offered the only firm ground . Above them leaned the brown Lip of a slowly sliding side of a hill . " Oh , my God ! " cried Marjorie , with horror , and sitting upright . " I read about that , in the papers , a week ago ! Were you there , seeing it /ourself , Jon ? Six children were buried in the slide , and died , and ? ight were rescued ! " " Yes , " said Jonathan . " I was there . I saw it . We had little shovels n our knapsacks , and it was a good thing we did . We sent one of the oys to the village and the rest of us dug into the mud . The eight were lucky ; we could pull them out because just their legs or their irms had been buried . But the other six kids were deep under tons if mud and rock and water . The men from the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , digging them out  --  and they were dead . All the lanterns were nrotand and lamps , and the parents , the ones whose kids had been oveil , and the ones whose kids had n't . And they had fires going , and Ilemeit working and digging , and the police , too . It was kind of ter11t ! r . " " I kar God , it must have been , " said Marjorie . " I saw drawings of it n the newspapers . Those pixie parents . " " Yes , " said Jonathan , Now his look at her was fiercer than ever and ighter . It was bad enough that their children had been smothered to  | death in all that mud . It was much worse because of the other fathers and mothers . Much worse . " He struck his bony knee with his brown fist . " God  --  damn  --  them , " he said in a low voice , and it was the voice of a man and not a youth . As each dead child , muddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cries of the bereaved rose harshly in that cold spring air , and they were the cries of tortured animals . The parents of the children who had been saved huddled together and stared at the distraught parents whose children had died . Then when the last child was brought out , whitestained face under the moon , and the weeping became more anguished , the parents of the rescued children moved into action . Their faces split into wide and exultant smiles . They pushed their children to the grieving mothers and fathers , their eyes glowing radiantly and with inhuman satisfaction in the mingled moonlight and lantern light . They pushed their children around and even over the little bodies on the dank earth which lay there so pitifully . In fact , they moved with eager excitement toward the bereaved . Exalted cries rushed from their mouths , and joyous whoops . They pressed their living children against the grieving , impatiently . " Look , look ! " they exclaimed . " My Susie , my Mary , my Tommy , my  --  my  --  my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them ! Is n't it wonderful ! Look , look . They 're alive . Susie , shake Mrs. Schwartz 's arm , so she 'll notice you . Look , Mrs. Benson ! Susie 's all right ! Look at my Elsie ! Look , look ! Why do n't you look ? " " I could n't believe it , " said Jonathan . " There they were , milling with their kids , shoving them at the fathers and mothers of the dead , demanding that those poor things look and rejoice and hug and congratulate ? and their own kids lying there as dead as , as dead as ? " He stopped . He stared before him . " We walked away . We did n't say anything . I  --  well , I wanted to kill . It 's the second time in my life I 've felt that way . I just wanted to kill , I tell you ! " and he glared at his mother . Marjorie said nothing . Her hands were folded tightly on her knee . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a long silence . " What in hell is the matter with people ? " Marjorie said , " Did you boys , and your teacher , talk it over together that night ? " " A little . I think we were all kind of sick and shaken . Then the teacher said that the parents of the living kids were just  --  just hysterical , and just happy , and they did n't mean anything cruel or brutal ? " Again he stared at his mother . " I do n't believe that . The dead kids were lying there , huddled up and broken and wet and dirty and smashed . You could see them . And you could hear their parents crying and praying and you could see them tearing desperately at each other , and trying to comfort each other , and screaming ? What the hell is the matter with  | people ? And those animals , shrieking with joy , as if they were triumphant , and shouting to their friends to look at the living kids , and ostling them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her son . Jonathan said , " There 's a lot of silly stuff being printed these days , in books , about ' understanding ' people . And the ' innate goodness ' of people . We are getting them n school . Maudlin books . You are supposed to ' understand ' everybody  --  and love everybody . A sweet , sentimental , gooey drip and stench ? that 's what is bring written now . Putrid stuff . Horace Mann . We read what he wrote , and the things he said , and what he did ? Warm pudding . ' 1 lum , mity rising , progressing to perfection . ' Other bilge . He was a Whig . A I Iumanist . He bawled over mankind . He loved , loved , loved , the swine ! " Jonathan struck his knee again , in a kind of desperation . " What was wrong with him , and all the others like him ? Could n't they sec the facts , the truth , about people ? Did n't they ever honestly say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And that is what I ask you now . Tell me about it . " Marjorie thought of her husband , Adrian Ferrier , and his song of man , his constant , unremitting , terrified song of man , his imploring song of man , his implicit and eternal and anxious demand to be assured that all was fair in the world , all men were brothers , all men instinctively loved each other , all men were good . She shook her head slightly . She looked at Jonathan . " I 'm not going to lie to you , dear . I 've never lied to you . I 've always told you the truth . Men are not good ; they are not kind ; they are not ust and tender and compassionate by nature . We are the most evil species this world has ever spawned , and I doubt we 'll ever be any better . Men like Horace Mann are just  --  frightened . They really know what their fellowman is , in spite of the oratory and the sweetness and the insistence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened to death of the world they know exists  --  and so they invent a pretty one instead *  | hot cocoa and a plate of cookies . But we should tell even very young children the absolute truth , so they will be armored against life and be able to endure reality . Lies are always wrong . " Jonathan smiled very bitterly . " You never did have much faith in people , did you ? Never mind . I do n't either , not much . But you have n't told me what was the matter with those people down there . " " It 's very simple . And very human . They were totally selfish , primitively human . They were exultant , and victorious . The fact that others had lost their children and were grieving and despairing just added an extra fillip , an extra gratification , to the mean pride they felt because their own children were not dead . And because they were so delighted and so elated , and so stimulated by the agonies of the others  --  you see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agonized rebuffs they received from the parents of the dead children . Most people , you see , are involved with no one but themselves . It 's a kind of wickedness ? But , it is understandably human . " " And , forgivable ? " Jon 's face had become taut and derisive . " No , " she said . " Never forgivable . Never to be condoned . Never to be smoothed over and explained ' in mawkish words . We must just look at our fellows starkly , accepting them for the appalling creatures they are ? We have no choice . We few who see without syrup in our eyes and without tremulous throbs in our hearts , and without being liars . " Jonathan sighed , and to Marjorie it was the most sorrowful sound . The boy said , " Horace Mann proclaims that children can be taught goodness and pity and mercy and kindness ? " " The poor man was a fool , a really dangerous fool , " said Marjorie . " I have n't any hope for mankind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You see , my father was a very intelligent man and refused to lie to me , and he told me all he knew about humanity . " " Was it painful for you ? " " Very . I never got over it . You can never get over a mortal wound , you know . You have to live with it , and there , I 'm afraid I have made a contradiction in terms . But there it is . You have to live with your knowledge all the days of your life . That does not exempt you from feeling pity , though , even for the creature that is man . His very terribleness should inspire compassion . " " From whom ? " Marjorie hesitated . " From God , perhaps . From the few of us who refuse to accept sweet lies and fantasies . We very few . " Then Jonathan said the most pathetic thing he had ever said in his young life , and the most pathetic thing he would ever say : " How can a person go on living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sadness , and tried to smile . " What else can we do ? You ca n't escape from the formidable truth , except through drink , perhaps , or in moments of rare personal happiness , or in music or poetry , or in the sights of nature  --  far from men . I 've read some of your books concerning the saints of the Church . Many of them fled the world , ' it is written , in order that they might contemplate God more clearly and live lives of chastity and austerity . I suspect those poor men just could n't stand their fellowmen any longer . They had to leave them and the world they made if they were to save their souls and their sanity . " Jonathan stood up . But he looked long and hard at the floor between his feet . " There 's another thing , dear , " said Marjorie , aching for him and his introduction to reality . " We few who know what men are must rarely let others know that we know . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The jugular , " said Jonathan . " Yes , I can see that . They 'll try to kill you , one way or another , if they know you 've caught on to them and know all about them . " " Yes . That 's the unpardonable sin you can commit against your brother : Letting him know that you know exactly what he is . He 'll hate you forever . " Jonathan moved slowly toward the door . Then Marjorie said , " Will you tell your father about your experience , dear ? " He turned and looked at her and again she saw that dark and warning look in his eyes . " No . He would n't understand . It would hurt him . He 's  --  kind . " And I am not , thought Marjorie as the door closed behind her son . That 's what he meant : I am not kind . I only tell the truth . " Damn this storm , " said Jonathan in a slurred voice , and he set the wine bottle thumpingly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , anyway ? Look at that lightning . " Marjorie 's mental return tonight to her pale and shining dining room was almost traumatic in its violence . for she had been so engrossed in her memories . She started . " It does seem pretty wild , does n't it ? " she said . The fresh strawberries and cream and tea had come , and had been partially eaten , and removed , Marjorie observed , though she had not the slightest memory of them . The wine bottle was empty . " Are you ready to leave ? " asked Jonathan . His face was very sunken in appearance , and his eyes were glazed with alcohol , and there was a tremor about his mouth and in his hands .  | " Yes , thank you , " said Marjorie . He came to her chair and drew it back for her . He walked to the buffet then , leaving her standing . " I think , " he said , " that I 'll take a bottle of bourbon upstairs with me . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was washing the tall bright windows and the wind was howling in the eaves . Jonathan was laboriously and with considerable careful difficulty fitting a crystal glass over the decanter . He was absorbed in the delicate task . Then , walking with slow caution , and putting each foot down tentatively , he left the dining room . His mother heard his heavy and uncertain step on the stairs . She listened , during an interval when there was only the rain and the wind . Jonathan had gone into his father 's study . She heard the solid bang of the door . She said to herself , " Yes , dear Jon , I always told you the truth . I never lied to you . Would it have been any better if I had ? I do n't know . In spite of all you knew , and all I told you , you became a good man and a doctor who simply could not bear pain in others . You did all you could to alleviate it . It was your personal enemy . Was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , and you were trying to exorcise it ? " I never lied to you . Except once . By silence . But it was for your sake , Jon , for your dear sake . " It seemed a century , this evening of inner revelation and discovery , a dreadful century . Marjorie wearily climbed the stairs to her own room . She could not face downstairs tonight , the lonely sofas , the empty chairs , the brilliant , lonely furniture , the glittering windows which would reflect nothing but a despairing woman 's face . By silence , I lied . Was that the better way ? By not speaking I saved you so much , Jon , so much more than you have already borne . I wonder , if you knew what I know , if you 'd be grateful to me ? Perhaps . Would the ultimate have been better than this ? She could hear Jonathan speaking on the telephone in the study . She paused , then went to the shut door and listened . " Good , good , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't let anyone in . Little sips of ice water only , or , better , little pieces of ice on her tongue . Do n't let anyone in . " You never did , dear , thought Marjorie . No , you never did . Except for Mavis . Before she fell asleep , after a long while , she repeated to herself , as if for consolation : " ' He is wounded , but not slain . He 'll lay him down and bleed a while , then rise and fight again . ' " Would he ? He had not forgotten Mavis , and only Marjorie knew that , Mavis the dearly beloved , and the hated .  | Jonathan stood drinking in his father 's study , drinking slowly and steadily , and he looked about him at the brown , golden and ruddy room , so calm and sedate under the soft light of lamps . He thought of it as an autumn room , for it was warm and quiet and gleaming , the walls hidden by bookshelves and the books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , not for their content so much as for their tawny shining leather and their gilt . There was no dark wood here , but only fruit woods and unstained mahogany , russet and polished and lacquered , so that it glowed like brown glass . The rug was a precious Chinese Oriental , in shades of yellow , ecru , cinnamon , copper and buff . The curtains were of gold silk ; all the ornaments were of bronze and very masculine in cast , and the lamps were bronze also with parchment shades . The fireplace was of brown marble , veined with yellow , and so was the hearth . Yes , it was very quiet . It had always been quiet and staid and spacious . Yet , curiously , in spite of the deep leather chairs , the beautifully carved old desk , the bright tables with their little Chinese boxes and ivories , the books , the general air of warmth , the broad mullioned window with its window seat covered with velvet cushions , there seemed to be no real invitation to rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to study . Adrian had called it his " retreat , " and had spent most of his leisure here among " my beloved books , my dearest companions , " yet it did not possess that peculiar atmosphere of contemplation and profound communion and repose that distinguishes the true library , the true study , of an intellectual man . In short , it was empty . It always shone ; it was always beautiful ; it gave the impression of invitation . The shining beauty remained after one entered here , but the superficial invitation soon vanished for it had never been truly given . It was a harmonious shell that had never contained life even in the beginning , for Adrian Ferrier had never possessed that life to give . It was no more lifeless now than it had been in his own period of existence . It was not an abandoned room ; it just had never been inhabited . Ion had known that as a child . But from childhood he had indulged his father in Adrian 's conceit that this was the throne room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuge from a hot and exigent world into the caverns of his own brilliant mind . " Always I am refreshed , " he would say . " No matter how weary I am , I come to my rcucat and think and muse and give rein to my fancy and let my thoughts  | soar , and soon peace comes to me and strength to bear the burdens of my life . " What his burdens had been Jonathan never knew , but he implied them , sighing , and would lift a plump white hand exhaustedly for a moment and then let it drop on the arm of his chair . He would then smile pathetically at Jonathan , his big blue eyes misty and wistful . Jonathan leaned against the oaken door of the library tonight , drinking slowly and steadfastly , and then with the strange clarity of drunkenness he began to smile and he said aloud , " Dear Papa , you were a terrible but lovable farce , and I always knew all about you . I loved you dearly , and still do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never let you know what I knew about you , because I pitied and protected you from sharp and perceptive Mama even when I was a little kid . Sharp and perceptive Mama . You knew she was on to you . She did n't have the humor and compassion not to let you know . But I did . And you were grateful , and in a way you 'd never understand you taught me a lot about people . You taught me , for one thing , to recognize a bore at once and to avoid him . Never mind , Papa . You were a little man , more ordinary than most , and you were very pretentious , and would n't Mama be surprised to know I know all this ! She thinks that I thought you an Intellect , and I let her think that because it amuses me and irritates her . " You were weak and vulnerable , and for some damned reason the weak and the vulnerable get right inside my vest and cuddle up in my viscera . Mama despises them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which leaves me in somewhat of a dilemma . Am I a little weak and vulnerable , too ? Was that one bond between us ? " He frowned at the glass in his hand , then took a gulp of it . He uttered a particularly foul word . " Maybe , " he said . " I never thought of that before . Well , hell , Papa . Poor old boy . I knew all the time that your insistent kindness and solicitude for others was only your terrified defense against your fellowman . You probably had a faint idea of what people are , and so you tried to fend them off , prevent potential attacks on you with declarations of your belief in mankind , that it really is good , decent , kindly at heart , bulging with the honey of good will and needing only encouragement to sprout wings . You gave money to every whimpering rogue , thief and lying mendicant who asked your help  --  so they 'd think well of you and praise you for a sensitive and compassionate man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely got a penny out of you . There , you were parsimonious . Sometimes you mortified me when the priest or the Sisters came around . Even though you sent them away with a few coppers or a little silver  --  poor devils  --  they thought you were the most benign creature in existence . The funny thing is , you really were . You were n't a hypocrite at all , though I suspect dear Mama always thought you were . You dearly loved yourself , but it was an  | innocent love , like a child 's . God , Papa , you made me ache all over , when I was a kid , myself , and you treated me as if I were your father . Did I like that ? Probably . Perhaps that was a bond between us , too . " I knew when I was still in knickers that you were incapable of dealing , foot to foot , fist to fist , with others . At heart , you were a woman , perhaps even a girl . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I know that every woman has masculine qualities and every man feminine ones ; that 's our duality . But your feminine qualities were greater than your masculine . " I think it was your terror of people that made you love harmless things , birds and trees and gardens . They never threatened you . Of what were you afraid , Papa ? I do n't think you ever knew . I do n't think you even had the slightest suspicion . You just did n't want to be hurt . Who does ? Unfortunately , all of us ca n't run away , as you ran away all your life . You did have loving and tender parents , so they never scared the hell out of you . You were born as you were born , with all your trembling genes and your fear . You could n't help it . But Mama thought you could . " Jonathan took another big swallow . The glittering surfaces in the room dazzled him . Cautiously he extended a hand and eased himself into a chair . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Poor Pa , " he said . " Your parents and your friends protected you . Everybody did . You were so easy to be fond of , with your gentle platitudes and cliches ; you never said a word to offend anyone . You could n't imagine speaking harshly , and I doubt you ever had a mean thought , either . You just were n't bright enough , Papa . The only one who refused to protect and shelter you was dear Mama . I think you came close to hating her , as close as you could hate anyone . You ran away from her . She probably impressed you as a gentle and understanding girl , when you were both young , and here was a new Mama already made to replace the one you had lost . But Mama never really was a Mama , though she bore you two sons . Except , of course , for darling Harald , the apple of her eye . " There was one last boom of thunder and then the storm retreated and now the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ( lied . " You know , " said Jonathan , smiling at the chair where his father used to sit " to receive my child 's closest confidences , " " I do n't think you really knew a lain Iw'ern from a good one , a stinker of a picture from a fine one . Put you tried . I think that 's damned touching , and always did . 1 particularly hated ' The Storm , ' over the fireplace , but you adored it , and though I never looked at it if I could avoid it I knew that you loved it and found it beautiful . It was just like you , Papa .  | " Yes , Papa , you were sweet and kind . Above all , you were harmless , and that 's a damned rare and precious quality in humanity . Harmlessness . I cherished that in you . And I never let you know one single infernal thing about me . It would have scared the dung out of you , and I loved you too much , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth . You could n't have stood it . So I invented dear little boyish troubles which you could handle nicely with aphorisms and strokings of my head , and soothing murmurs . It made you happy . You died , thinking kids are innocent lambs , trailing clouds of glory . ' That 's from your pet poet , Wordsworth , and he makes me ill . " Jonathan filled his glass solemnly . He toasted his father 's empty chair . " I miss you like hell , " he said . " I miss your harmlessness . You were the only harmless creature I ever knew . Papa , your health , wherever you are . " He laughed a little , and sprawled in his chair . " Papa , if there is anything to immortality , I just know what you are now , and what you are doing . You are wandering around the blue and shining halls of heaven with a feather duster in your hands , and all the angels pat you on the head as they hurry about their business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you particularly . I bet you never committed a mortal sin in your life . The capital sins were only words to you , were n't they ? What did you tell the priests in the Confessional , Papa ? Did you have to invent little venial sins ? The sins of a child ? " You never knew what Mavis was . You loved her always , did n't you ? You did n't live to see us married . You spoke of her as a dear girl , a treasure , a love . ' Yes , Papa , she was indeed . Indeed . I 'm glad you never knew how many times I came close to killing her . I thought of a thousand ways ? " The glass slipped from his inert hand and dropped to the floor and spilled its contents . He neither knew nor cared . He was fully drunk . He stared blankly before him , but his thoughts were not blank . His exhausted face took on the dark shadow of agony . Mavis , Mavis , Mavis , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He had been twenty-three years old , two years in medical school , when he had first become aware of Mavis Eaton , niece and adopted daughter of Dr. Martin Eaton and his wife Flora . Certainly , he had seen the little girl from babyhood , then as a toddler , then a running child shrill and insistent , for she was very spoiled . ( Her uncle and aunt invariably referred to her , even after they had adopted her , as " That sweet , motherless , fatherless , little one ! " ) But so small a child hardly could inspire a boy and a youth with tenderness except in an academic way , for Jonathan even so young liked children . So , he had seen her ,  | had absently noted her , had thought she was exceptionally handsome for a child , had idly admired her , but had not been attracted by her pert ways , her open rudeness to her adoring uncle and adopted father , and her loud and unexpected outbursts of somewhat rough laughter . There had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even hardly past puberty , had disliked grubbiness . Still later , she had lost her baby teeth , and her hair appeared lank and uncombed , and though he was polite to her in her uncle 's house  --  which he visited often  --  she appeared to him to have lost the shining and spotless and rounded sweetness of earlier years . She had not liked him . Other visiting young men , studying medicine , had deferred to her ostentatiously so that the formidable , rich and famous I ) r . Eaton would look upon them kindly and possibly , in the future , sponsor them . But Jonathan Ferrier was aloof and independent , and these the ten-year-old Mavis interpreted as " stuck-up " and " thinks right well of himself , and he 's so homely , too . " He never brought her little gifts to flourish above her eager hands in the presence of the smiling Dr. Eaton and her Aunt Flora . On several occasions , annoyed at her vexation that her uncle and Jonathan were going into his study , where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a peremptory way she hated , " Run along , little girl , and play with your dolls or pester someone else . " This seemed outrageous to Mavis , for had not her uncle intended to take her for a ride to the ice-cream parlor before " the prig " had appeared ? She came to hate him . When she was between the ages of ten and twelve Jonathan had rarely , if ever , even seen her , probably because when he was at home he contrived to visit the house when she was at school , or bicycling or away on the interminable picnics with which her generation were engrossed . He would sometimes hear her demanding voice in the kitchen or in the halls , but he never encountered her in them . The Eaton house was on a street broad , spacious and filled with trees and exceptionally wide even for Hambledon , which was famous for its expansive thoroughfares . It stood on two acres of land , far back from the street and cloistered in a heavy stand of linden trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the whole of Hambledon was fragrant when they bloomed , and certainly a warm damp wind carried their scent for long distances . The house rose above all its neighbors , for Dr. Eaton 's father had fancied a tall knoll , and so it overlooked the roofs of other houses , and the upper windows , where the servants slept , stared at distant streets and had a long close look at the river . In fact , the deep and rambling rear gardens sloped down to the river promenade , as the townsfolk liked to call the smooth , silvery gray planks that ran at the : cat of the big houses very close to the water . But every house 's rear  | gardens were guarded by low fences with doors in them , usually locked , though a tall youth or man could easily have jumped over them . Jonathan Ferrier thought the house and its neighbors were hideous , though they were considered very stylish with their wide shadowy verandas and shutters and little turrets and small silly towers and fretwork and stained-glass hall windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another door . " Dripping with tortured cellulose , " he would say of them . " Well , I suppose it gives jig-cutters employment , but that is about all you can say for all that wooden lace drooping from every possible knothole and eaves " The Eaton house had even more " wooden lace " than its neighbors , and was made of wood painted a particularly  --  to Jonathan  --  repulsive chestnut brown , with bright yellow shutters and yellow shingles . It had two towers , in front , one at each end , and the dormer windows of the second and third floors had tiny little spires rising from them , intricately carved , and not only was there a stained-glass window in the front hall door but a huge one , at least twelve feet high and eight across , in the exact middle of the house , indicating the spiral staircase inside . It was called a " mansion , " for it had eighteen rooms and even one referred to as a " ballroom , " though it was hardly that even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Mavis was older . ) Its rooms were long , narrow and gloomy even on the brightest day , but that was the style , to preserve the glow of wood and the fabric of expensive brocade draperies and the shimmer of Aubusson and Oriental rugs . When the walls were not paneled they were hung , in the drawing room ( no " parlors " for the Eatons ! ) with crimson rose damask , and in the dining room , golden damask . Even so , so fearful was Mrs. Eaton and her generation of the burning rays of the incontinent sun that all the windows , except the servants ' , could be found at least half shuttered even in winter , except on the very darkest days . The fear of the sun and its " harmful propensities " was not the only reason for the murkiness of the house 's interior . There was also a belief , generally held , that only the vulgar threw open windows and shutters all the time  --  such as servants ? and " had no respect for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genteel . They had no private lives . The house was richly furnished and was as hideous to Jonathan Ferrier as the exterior , and all the tables and sofas and chairs were big and heavy and upholstered in dark velvets or horsehair or somber silks , and the fireplaces were thickly cluttered with masses of ornamental china , elks ' horns , vases , clocks , little gilt boxes , shells , Staffordshire ware and containers for artificial flowers ( waxed or fashioned of crepe paper , even when gardens were exploding with color ) . And , of course , at each side of the fireplaces stood immense Chinese jars filled with  | gilded bulrushes or ostrich plumes or any other exotica the lady of the house fancied , such as pussywillows in the spring , the only sign of any particular season . Only the broad gardens , with their conservatory , were absolutely beautiful , though even here there was a gazebo of latticework painted brilliant white and filled with wicker furniture with velvet cushions , - where the ladies took their tea on hot summer days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been designed by an artist who was now long dead . His successor was a genius of his kind , and managed , on two acres , to hint of forests of tall pine , grottoes , little wayward paths , hidden cool nooks and silent recesses . The lawns cunningly appeared immense and endless , for there were no definite boundaries and the trees , which included an oak or two , several maples and a cluster of elms and one pointed poplar , seemed about to advance at any moment on that stretch of incredibly green grass , meticulously cut and totally without a single weed . Gardens of flowers , always in bloom , gave the impression that they had simply dropped from the cerulean heavens at a gesture of grace , for they were not formal and were idly shaped . All this was artful , of course , but it was also charming , and Jonathan loved the Eaton gardens almost as much as his mother 's . " Artistry , " he would say , " can be so superb , sometimes , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Eaton received the first prize of the Garden Club , though her labors in her gardens often consisted of inspecting the work of the gardeners every morning and speaking to them sharply , and strolling , in a light frothy dress , every evening to permit the scented rising wind to play with her thick masses of bright dark hair . She was a thin woman , too slender for fashion , but her wardrobe was superb , she purchasing all her dresses in New York , and these expensive treasures drew attention away from her dark and predatory face with its big lean nose , her tight and colorless mouth and her small penetrating black eyes . She had great style , everyone said , and marvelous taste , and she had also inherited a great deal of money which covered many malicious little sins of character and a truly awesome stupidity , not to mention very black and very thick eyebrows that were a single bar over her eyes . Dr. Martin Eaton , in contrast with his wife , was big , lumbering , awkward and clumsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicacy were famous . I is had a fat face , almost square , small kind blue eyes , a now like a peeled potato and heavy nearly Negroid lips which could give a smile singularly tender , steadfast and sweet , inspiring courage and trust in anyone who was favored by it . Even when he had been thirty he had been nearly totally bald , and now his head was a vast one of which he pretended to be very proud . " Houses an enormous  | brain , Flora says , " he would say with a wink . " My friends , however , remark that the feller  --  what was his name ? ? who immediately preceded Homo sapiens had a brain cage about twice the size of a normal man 's these days . " As he had inherited a considerable fortune a few who did not admire Flora would often wonder why he had married her . It would have surprised these to know that the two had a remarkably compatible marriage , even a serene one , for Flora fully believed that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous genius , and Martin Eaton loved his wife for her deference to him , her devotion to his smallest need and comfort , her admiration , her absolute loyalty to her household , and her love for his niece . Unlike other wives , she never suspected that her husband was sometimes foolish and childish and unreasonable and illogical , and so he could relax in his house at night , confident that no wifely comment would be made concerning his appearance , the people he was treating , his particular friends , or his behavior at the last dinner they had given , or the amount of " spirits " ? very copious  --  he had drunk yesterday or was drinking tonight . " Gentlemen must have their relaxations , " she would say in tones of absolute authority , " and doctors more than most . " This , then , was Mavis Eaton 's background , she who had inherited quite a fortune , herself , and was to know no suffering whatsoever in her life until the final days of her last agony when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more tragic than ordinarily , for Mavis had lived in eternal sunshine , adored , admired , courted , pampered , petted , rich , beautiful and totally fascinating . Still others bitterly remarked that into that " Eden of a lovely life had come the snake of Jonathan Ferrier , to destroy it . " " She never said a word , never a word , " her broken uncle muttered on his stroke-tortured bed after her tragic death , " never a word against him , ever . Always smiling , always saying everything was wonderful and how dearly she loved him . Until the hour before she died . Then she told me . " " Everything was Jon this ' and Jon that , ' and what could she do to make Jon even happier than he was with her , and would Jon like this or that , or she must hurry home for tea for Jon always wanted to see her face first when she opened the door for him . It was her greatest sadness that she had no children , my dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But Jon never wanted any children , she said . " It was on a hot August day that Jonathan Ferrier , twenty-three years old , became aware of Mavis , in her twelfth year . In fact , as he never forgot , it was August 12 , 1888 . He had ridden his bicycle over to Dr. Eaton 's house , for his horse was  | being treated for some vague disorder . He was a tall , exceptionally thin , dark young man , still quite lanky though with a peculiar grace and elegance about him , and a clever , reticent face which could still become open and lively among friends . His dark eyes were restless but kind and the corners were wrinkled with the marks of laughter . No one could quite decide whether or not he was handsome , or perhaps even ugly . A very few had seen the thick white ridges spring out about his mouth , so the general consensus , after some time , was that he was " attractive in a sort of aristocratic way . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare with the rising brother , Harald , who was as gloriously beautiful as a matinee idol , and who already had the girls mad with love for him , and had the " nicest " disposition . Ile wore , on that August day , a suit of light gray wool , a stiff straw hat with a gay red ribbon on it , polished black shoes and a shirt striped in pale blue . His collar was stiff , high and brilliant , and his tie was a devilish scarlet , bought at the university and somewhat shocking to Hambledon . He wore no gloves , and this was unpardonable , and his face and hands were burned dark with the sun , which was vulgar . He leaned his bicycle against the steps of the high deep veranda of the Eaton house , and was whistling some lively tune whose lyrics would not have been admired in Hambledon . He took off his coarse-straw hat and fanned himself briskly and danced a step or two out of sheer youthful exuberance . His movements were fluid and almost professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad flags of the walk . He appeared to float at high moments . His mother considered him too grave and severe at twenty-three , but today , for some reason , he was lighthearted and practically ready to believe that the world might be an enjoyable place sometimes if one had a sharp eye out for it . He concluded his dance with a flourish , waved his hat high and was about to clap it back on his thick dark hair when he heard a light laugh , so fragile and pure that he thought it was the tinkling of one of the many Chinese glass prisms which hung in clusters from the roof of the veranda . Then he saw a young girl moving on a cushioned swing . Seeing that she had attracted his attention , she laughed a little louder and mockingly clapped her hands . *  | and stared at her . " You have n't , " he said with shortness , then was still . For it was most evident that Mavis had , indeed , approached an astonishing measure of maturity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she had a look of deep animal happiness . She leaned back in her swing , smiling , and he was struck by her smile , for it was utterly beguiling . He thought at once : The Laughing Girl , and it pleased him that he had reached , in only a moment or two , a perfect miniature evaluation of Mavis . She was born to laughter , and to laugh , as others are born to grieve or to work or to be intelligent or to be geniuses . It would not be a contrived laughter , or a laughter solely for effect  --  though it could be that , also , nor a false or artificial mirth , nor a grudging one . Mavis was laughter . It was an integral part of her nature , and she laughed as others merely smiled or did not smile at all . She had lost the little irritabilities of young childhood , for they had been merely superficial . Now all her innate capacity for finding almost everything amusing , and everything provocative of laughter , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a husky and gleeful laugh , evoking laughter in anyone she encountered . Jonathan , staring , thought of something Keats had written . This was very strange , for Jonathan did not admire the delicate and tragic if somewhat flowery Keats , though he was much attached to the more sinewy poets . He said to himself , as he looked at Mavis smiling at him from her swing : " Surely I dreamt today , or did I see The winged Psyche with awakened eyes ? " Jonathan had seen many beautiful young blondes in his twenty-three years , each one prettier than the last . So , the round and perfect young face confronting him , with its apricot and milky coloring , would not have made him stand there so long , gazing with what he long later called " disgusting oxlike enchantment . " He had seen eyes as blue and lucid before , and gilt lashes as profuse and all of a sweet tangle . He was not startled by such a faintly rosy mouth , full and just barely pouting and excellently curved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was admittedly entrancing , tilted and translucent about the nostrils . The thick golden hair that fell in a heavy fall far below the shoulders was , of course , rare in its quality of luminosity and total yellowness , like a buttercup , but he had seen as beautiful before , natural and dyed . Her teeth were exquisite , somewhat large but white , and he had seen teeth like this many times . He had seen riper figures , for all her precociousness of adorable body and tiny waist and small and dimpled white arms , Mavis was still only twelve . She was still a child , though she had reached physical maturity .  | Her hair was tied with a blue ribbon and she wore a blue voile dress with a pink sash , and blue slippers . Childish attire . It was something else , mysterious and bewitching , that held him there , gawking . It was a quality of absolute bright assurance , of magnificent soft confidence , of healthy amiability and endearing seduction , of enormous vitality , perhaps , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe and understand charm , and had been as defeated as everyone else . Mavis possessed it in overwhelming measure , like a fairy cloak , like a blessing , like the gift it was . It did not lie in any particular feature , nor was it caught in her golden mist of hair or in her smallish blue eyes , shining and glowing . There was not the slightest flaw to be seen in Mavis , but Jonathan had seen flawless girls before and had found them intensely dull . He had a confused thought : Was Mavis stupid ? He remembered the shrill and grubby child he had avoided through the years , and it seemed incredible to him that that untidy little hoyden had birthed so gorgeous a young girl . But , was she stupid ? Jonathan , above all things , hated stupidity , and beauty never excused it . He found it the matrix for the abominable vices and the explanation for what was most bestial in humanity . Mavis , never looking away from him , laughed again that entirely captivating laugh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with humor and  --  this was irresistible  --  verve and joy in living . It was a laugh that invited the whole world to an expression of mirth , and Jonathan found himself smiling . He forgot to wonder if Mavis were stupid . He saw that she loved to be alive and expected others to have that love , also . She rejoiced in life as a bird rejoices in it , or some small creature of the field , or as a dancing sapling , rosy with blossoms , fluttered in the spring . To Mavis , it was evident , life was to be taken joyously in both hands and eaten like a particularly large and spicy and fragrant fruit . She would rarely find the worm . She would generously proffer the fruit to be shared , and laugh with pleasure . She was not overly tall , and she was not frail nor did she have the look of raw immaturity . She might have been seventeen instead of twelve , for the breast of the blue dress was daintily rounded above the narrow waist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and the lace petticoat . The legs , though mostly concealed , were beautifully formed , and the ankles like thin china in their white silk stockings . She was horn to laugh , to sing , to dance , to play in the sun , thought Jonathan Perrier . She was horn never to grow old , no matter how many years she will have . She is the Laughing Girl . She approached him nearer , her brad a little tilted as she studied him , her squinted eyes a little puzile l at his prolonged stare . Then the  | puzzled look disappeared , and Mavis understood . Jonathan might be an old man  --  but he was exactly like the boys she knew and so she was not shy with him . Mavis , in her way , was a very wise girl . The dress was ugly in the fashion of that year , though it was expertly and deftly made . It bunched in a very pronounced bustle just above and slightly over Mavis ' hips , for all it was a schoolgirl 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It did not distort her beauty , which had the baffling quality of illuminating her pervasive and formidable charm as even the finest beauty often can not if it is the possession of another sort of female . In short , her beauty was only the net in which something more iridescent , something , perhaps , more deadly , and something far more powerful , was caught  --  the captive yet the possessor . Mavis possessed what many ugly women have possessed , and which has driven kings from thrones and has devastated empires , and was possessed by it . It is beyond explanation , as Jonathan now knew . The only safety is flight . Jonathan did not fly . Mavis was smiling now , and not laughing . Yet the aura of laughter was about her , deeper than the aura of her intense beauty . It was there , a permanent anticipation , waiting to break upwards like a leaping wave in a calm sea , at the slightest breeze . Jonathan did not even suspect he was maudlin when he thought : " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself when he thought : " She is a golden rose . " " You 've grown up , Mavis , " he said and did not think he was banal . It was a marvel to him that this was Mavis , and it was Mavis who was the marvel . " Girls usually do , " she said . She had a husky speaking voice also , which trembled always as if the impatient laughter was swelling beneath it and was demanding to be heard . She stood so near him that he could have touched her . And then , a little to his helpless horror he had the most profound and urgent desire to touch her , indeed . He was appalled , for he was a mature man of twenty-three and the girl before him was still almost a child , and he knew that what he was feeling now was a most powerful sexual urge toward her , stronger than any he had known before in his life . She stood before him on the quiet porch , looking up into his eyes and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete knowledge and that she was amused . Years younger than he , she was incalculably older and more aware . " I hope you like what you see , Jon , " she said , and chuckled , and he was again fascinated for the chuckle was deep , warm and rich , the knowing mirth of a woman . " You 've improved , " he said , and he fought down his desperate desire for her with loathing for himself . He tried for lightness . " My last  | memory of you was of a dirty little kid with a runny nose and tousled hair . " " Really ? " she said . " And do you know what I 've always thought about you , Jon ? You 're dippy . " And again she chuckled , but it was not a taunting for , as Jon was later to discover about the Laughing Girls , they never taunt idly except when they are bored with a lover or a husband and wish him forever out of sight . He found himself chuckling with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and kiss her with a man 's passion and desire . He tipped his hat a little mockingly , then went to the door and pulled the bell . The day was hot and there was the raucous shrilling of cicadas in the sun and quiet , and the distant rattle of a wagon 's wheels on cobblestones , and the heated swish of trees . They seemed to roar in Jon 's ears like a confused cacophony , and for the moments he stood there , resolutely facing the door with its stained-glass windows , he felt the smiling eyes of the girl fixed directly between his shoulders . " Daddy 's in the garden , and it 's Mamie 's day off , " she informed him , " and Mama 's downtown shopping . " He heard her light quick step running down the porch stairs , and he was alone , and when he turned he saw the flash of golden hair in the sun and that heart-softening chuckle . He went home . It was not until he was entering his parents ' house that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fragrant dusk of the beautiful hall and despised himself . His mother came in from the morning room , raising her brows in surprise . " Why , dear , " she said , " I thought you had gone to see Martin Eaton . Was n't he home ? " Jonathan had never learned to lie very well or often , and so he said , " Yes , he was home . " Marjorie came nearer him , and she was puzzled . " Jon , is there something wrong ? " He was impatient . He threw his hat on a chair and it rolled off and he let it lie . Marjorie bent and picked it up and then stood with it in her hands . " What can be wrong ? " he said . " Well , " said Marjorie , who was a little worried . It had been established that Jon would do his internship under the wing of Martin Eaton 's friends , and that 1 ) r . F.aton would more than sponsor him in Hambledon . She wondered if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatal matter , but an inconvenient and anxious one . She knew Jonathan 's temper , his quick and even murderous rages , his dislike for any quibbling or deviousness , his way of stamping a man a hypocrite under the slightest prows atlon , and his deadly impatience and intolerance of humbug . " Come into the morning room , " she said . " I have some very icy  | lemonade and some fresh cake , which I made this afternoon . You look very hot . " " I want a drink , " he said , and his voice was rude and his manner abrupt . " And that does n't mean lemonade . " Jonathan did not drink regularly , as yet , but when he did it was somewhat disturbing to his mother , for he drank as recklessly as he lived , and always under stress . She said nothing when he went into the dining room to the liquor cabinet , and she put away his hat , then stood in thought for a moment in the hall . She wanted to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not accompany her , but might possibly do so if she waited for him . He came back into the hall with a glass of whiskey and soda , and Marjorie noticed the darkness of the drink . " Where 's Childe Harald ? " he asked . " Boating , " she replied . " He 's gone on a picnic to Heart 's Ease . " She smiled . " Let 's go into the morning room , shall we ? " and she led the way , her slender figure floating in the light green voile of her dress , her head high . She hoped Jon would follow , and she hoped this ardently , and she let out a deep breath when she heard his following if reluctant footsteps . They sat down together in the pure light of the charming room , and Marjorie took up her needlework and bent her head over it . There was no use pressing Jon for an explanation , she thought . There had never been any use , even when he had been a child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure . " Well , since you were so insistent on that damned lemonade , why do n't you drink it yourself ? " he asked , standing before her . " Oh . Yes . Of course . Do pour me a glass , dear . " He poured a glass for her , then stood sipping his own , frowning into the glass . She saw that he was sallow under his tanned face , as if he had some unpleasant experience . But she merely waited . After a little he sat down , but on the edge of his chair , and this time he was not so careful of the creases in his trousers . " A hot day , " she said . " Martin does n't like the heat , does he ? I remember when we were children ? " " A long time ago . " Marjorie smiled . " Not so long . I was visiting his parents , with my own parents . I was always thin , I remember , and he used to tease me , but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the heat affected him so cruelly . " She paused . " Today is the hottest day of the summer . Poor Martin must be suffering . " " Oh , hell , do n't beat about the bush , " said Jonathan . " You want to  | know if I saw him , and if not why not . I did n't see him , though he was at home . I did n't want to see him . " " I see , " said Marjorie . " No you do n't , " said Jonathan . He drank again . He turned the glass restlessly in his hands . He had never confided in his mother but twice in all his life and he did not intend to now . In fact , the very idea staggered him . What would she say if he said to her bluntly , " I saw young Mavis Eaton , and she 's grown into a terrible beauty , and I wanted to drag her away somewhere and tear the clothes off her and rape her , not gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man explain bewitchment and that awful urge he had never suspected lived in him ? His mother , too , was a gentlewoman and she not only would not understand but would rise and leave him with disgust and dread and with his own horror . She would not faint as it was the style for ladies to faint when they were overcome . She would not call for smelling salts and fans . But she would detest him . He had never cared what his mother 's private feelings for him were , or her thoughts , or at least he had long ago assured himself he did not care . Yet the thought of her glance of repulsion made him shrink inwardly . And quite right , too , he said to himself . He stood up . " I want another drink , " he said . Marjorie did not comment . She only hoped he would return . He did not for a considerable time and when he entered the room again she more than suspected that the drink in his hand was his third , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sat down . " ' You drink too much , Jon , for your age and your health . " " No , " said Marjorie . " I promised myself a year ago I 'd never say it again . After all , you are not a boy any longer , you are not a youth , either . You are twenty-three years old and so you are a man and your life is your own . And a man must do what he feels he must do . " " Now , that 's a subtle aphorism , " said Jon , in the mocking voice he always used when he felt he must protect himself . " ' A man must do what he feels he must do . ' Martin Eaton 's a sot . Everybody knows it . Is he doing what he feels he must do ? " Marjorie put her sewing in her lap and looked at her son long and gravely . Then she said , " Yes . " " Yes ? Yes what ? " " Just ' yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can be reticent you know . " " I 'm reticent about my own affairs ? " " So am I. " Jon thought alw , ut that and was intrigued . Then he said at last , grinning , " Oh , nol Not you and old Martin Elton ? Before I ) ad , I sup-pose ? "  | " Martin and Flora are very happily married , " said Marjorie , sipping at her own glass . " It was a very suitable marriage . " " Imagine ! " said Jonathan in a nasty tone . " He might have been my father ! " " I never considered it seriously , " said his mother , smiling a little . " It did n't happen back in the dark ages you know , Jon . We 'd known each other from childhood , and I was always fond of Martin . You would n't believe it , but I called him Fancy . " Jonathan laughed . The fearful tension and sickness in him was relaxing under the drink and the soothing voice of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's only twenty-five years older than you , Jon , and hardly a patriarch at forty-eight . He told me , when we were very young , that he 'd wait until I had grown up , and then ? " Very carefully , Jonathan put down his glass . " Oh ? And how old were you then ? " " Eleven ? Yes , I was eleven , or almost . " " And he ? " " Well , he was older . Sixteen , I think . " " A man ! " " Almost . We thought a boy of sixteen was a man in those misbegotten days , though now we do n't think they are full men until they are twenty-one . It 's so absurd . Men today are no younger in any way than they were then . " But Jonathan was drinking again , though more slowly . " Sixteen , " he said . " And a big sixteen I should think . Probably had already had a roll or two ? I 'm sorry , Mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marjorie . " Coming down to it , I should think so , about Martin . He was always a lusty boy and a lusty man . That 's why I really did almost marry him , though I did not take him seriously . He was like a brother . Now , if he had not been so close to me , and so brotherly all my life , I might have ? " But Jonathan said , " And you did n't know at eleven , of course . " " Certainly I knew ! A girl of eleven is really much older than a youth ten years older ! It is said that all men are little boys at heart , but it is very doubtful that women were ever little girls . I knew that Martin ? what is the delicate phrase ? ? wished to make love to me , and I thought it very exciting . Children are n't as innocent as you might think , Jon . " " And you knew , at eleven , that he wanted to seduce you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In many ways you are quite old-fashioned and unsophisticated ? " " Never mind analyzing me , " Jon interrupted , and his mother looked at him with suddenly intent surprise . " Did you know ? "  | Marjorie was thinking rapidly . It was not like Jon to engage in a long talk with her . He usually found her boring , or at least he pretended so . And it certainly was not like Jon to be so  --  well , almost fiercely ? interested in a light and trivial conversation about her childhood and girlhood . Politeness was unknown to him . He never endured ennui , or made casual chatter , especially not with her . It was not the whiskey that was speaking through him though Marjorie suspected that it had loosened some of the harsh control he usually kept over himself . She looked at him with what deluded him was a mild interest and nothing else , but her maternal eyes were weighing and studying and coming to a startled conclusion , though she did not as yet know the object . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She smiled and her slender face brightened with mirthful remembrance . " It was n't moonlight and roses for me , as adults think it is with children . Children are earthy . It is only later that they cover the raw exigencies of nature with a pink gauze of romance and accompany it with poetry and music . Adults are really shrinking souls , but children look at life candidly and see it fully , and are not repelled by smells , nastinesses or criminal acts . That is because they have no conscience to confuse things . They are savages , and any aspects of life are always interesting to them , even those we call the dirtiest ones . Well , anyway , Martin did n't seduce me , not even when I was fourteen , fifteen , and so on . By that time he had become romantic and said he loved me . " " You must have been a fatal woman even at eleven , " said Jonathan . " You 've been reading Marie Corelli , " said Marjorie . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the cradle , but some more than most . The rare woman , the very rare woman , is still fatal even when she is ninety or more . But that 's a different kind of fatality , thank God . I 've seen only two or three women like that , and they were deadly . " " In what way ? " Marjorie leaned forward and put her elbows on her knees and pretended to consider . But she was thinking more rapidly than before , and she said to herself , Who , for God 's sake ? A very young girl ? A gill hardly past childhood ? Poor Jon . But it may he dangerous . " In what way ? " she repeated thoughtfully . " A really frightful way , dear . You sec , they never loved anyone in their lives . They were incapable of it . They never got over the love affair they had had with themselves in the cradle . And that made them irresistible . Men , especially , adore women incapable of loving anyone but themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all that passionate adoration , and they loin the adorers , " " Narcissistic , you mean ? "  | " What ? " " Oh , that 's a term seeping in from Vienna or somewhere . Alienists are using it . It means being in love with yourself . A sort of mental sickness . " " Yes . An excellent word . But those women are n't ill , Jon . You 'll find they are unusually healthy and robust and have an atmosphere about them of overpowering zest and love for life , and gusto . Everything is delightful to them , enjoyable ; a relish , tang , adventure . They 're never openly annoyed . They are always ready for any escapade . And they laugh  --  always . There 's just one thing you must never do to them : You must never bore them . That 's the only crime they hold against anyone . " " The Laughing Girls , " said Jonathan . " Exactly . " Marjorie smiled , pleased , and nodded . " The Laughing Girls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful , who do n't arouse envy and hatred among the other women . They can bewitch women as well as men . They 're absolutely female , and that 's lethal . Yes . I should say their great charm is that they are entirely female , and know it , and exploit it . One of the most formidable Laughing Girls I 've ever known was an elderly aunt of mine , who was then at least sixty-eight . A great-aunt . She was extremely ugly , with a big wart on one cheek , a dumpy short figure , like Queen Victoria , scanty white hair , piglike eyes and big thrusting lips . Absolutely no style , and little intelligence , I 'm afraid . But she had a devastating effect on everybody , in spite of the fact that she was not in the least fastidious about her person and had a way of wiping her nose on the back of her hand if she could n't find a handkerchief immediately . But everybody adored her , though she had no style and no graces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still a child , however , when I knew her , and I thought , the first time I saw her , that she was a nasty old woman with a loud hoarse voice and vile manners and dirty fingers . Then I heard her laugh , and I was her slave thereafter , even if I knew she was n't worth the cut fingernail of one of her five husbands  --  who seemed to die off very fast and leave her simply enormous bags of money . " It was her charm , you see , and her zest for life , and she lived to be ninety-five and passionately enjoyed every moment of it and died , protesting . She loved herself completely , and had a great sense of humor , brutal , but she was never humorous about herself and the things she constantly demanded for herself . There , her humor ended . A very bad , wicked old woman , even from her cradle . We called her kind ' adventuresses , ' when they were kept women or danced on the stage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
