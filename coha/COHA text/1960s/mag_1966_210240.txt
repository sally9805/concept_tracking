Like any other voodoo mystic , Haitian Dictator Franois ( " Papa Doc " ) Duvalier has his good-luck day : the 22nd . He was elected " President " on Sept. 22 , 1957 , inaugurated Oct. 22 , then installed as " President for Life " on June 22 , 1964 . Some Haitians even credit his occult powers with the Nov. 22 , 1963 assassination of President Kennedy , a longtime foe . But last Jan. 22 , Duvalier 's luck suddenly seemed to turn when one of his two DC-3s crashed on Haiti 's southern peninsula , crippling his rickety little air force . Haitians hopefully spread the word that Duvalier might be in trouble with the spirits . Last week , however , he was still on top of his miserable land . <P> <P> Terror &; Submission . In eight ruthless years , Duvalier has terrorized his 4,500,000 people into numb submission . Life expectancy is 32.6 years . Per-capita income is $70 a year . Population density is the highest in the hemisphere . Illiteracy runs 90% . " Haitians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer . " Duvalier 's 5,000-man Tonton Macoute ( Creole for bogeymen ) roam the country , soaking up blood money from businessmen , torturing and murdering suspected **28;632;TOOLONG even slaughtering whole families . Early this year , one mutilated corpse lay a whole day in the Port-au-Prince sun , as a grim lesson to Haitians . <P> Fully half of Haiti 's $28 million yearly budget goes into the pockets of Papa Doc , his Tonton Macoute , and other loyal supporters . The other half goes to government operations , which have all but shut down . Phone service is nearly dead . Lights wink on and off fitfully . Main waterfront roads are pot-holed or sometimes buried in six inches of muddy ooze . Business is grinding to a halt in the same way-partly owing to stiff taxes and partly to the emergence of a new , uneducated and sadly unprepared black elite that is replacing the bright , well-trained mulattoes who long ran Haiti 's commercial life . <P> To help lure back some of the country 's moneywise mulattoes-as well as other investors and tourists-Papa Doc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Port-au-Prince . " It is urgent , " he said , " for every Haitian-wherever he is-to come home and work with the President and Cabinet and with every foreign investor that Haiti needs for its development . The Haitian soil belongs to every Haitian . " The " explosive stage " of his revolution was over , Papa Doc promised , and now Haiti was entering the more humane " administrative stage . " <P> And sure enough , last week both soldiers and Tonton Macoute were indeed less visible in Port-au-Prince . Cars traveling through the city were not stopped and searched . What 's more , Papa Doc had even expressed an interest in visiting Argentina next August-a rare risk for any dictator afraid of losing his job .
