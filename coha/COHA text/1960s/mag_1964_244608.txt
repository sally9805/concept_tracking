The era in which Vice President Thomas Marshall proclaimed a good five-cent cigar a national necessity brought the U.S. cigar industry its greatest success : the 8,500,000 stogies sold in 1920 still add up to a record . But good times are here again , thanks to the Surgeon General 's report linking cigarette smoking and cancer . So far this year , cigar sales are running 30% above last year . Last week , while R. J. Reynolds , Liggett &; Myers and American Tobacco all reported lower first-quarter sales , the report of Consolidated Cigar Corp . came out as rosy as the tip of a well-lit 75-center . Consolidated , the largest of the some 500 U.S. cigar makers ( with 25% of all sales ) , showed an 18.7% hike in sales for the quarter and seems certain to surpass 1963 's record $123 million . <P> Pitching to Women . Consolidated and eleven other major companies , which together ring up 75% of all cigar sales , make a range of cigars from diminutive cigarillos to big , blunt coronas . The sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those with plastic tips , that have been grabbed up by reformed cigarette smokers . In some cities , cigarillo sales are up as much as 400% , and wholesalers are rationing supplies . Many cigar makers just can not keep up with demand ; unlike high-speed automated cigarette lines , cigar making still involves slow hand operation . <P> The wholesale switch of cigarette smokers has jumped the cigar-smoking populace to 18 million . Among them are an estimated 100,000 women , including such well-pouted puffers as Greta Garbo and Edie Adams , who advertises Consolidated 's Muriels . The heaviest pitch to women has been made by second-ranked General Cigar ( " Should a gentleman offer a Tiparillo to a lady ? " ) , but Consolidated has also acknowledged the market . It 's " Have you noticed how many men are smoking cigars ? " ads have been discreetly rephrased to " Have you noticed how many people are smoking cigars ? " The cigar companies doubt that the feminine market will last , and predict that cigarette sales will increase again ; but the industry hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have reached . To do so , and to attract young men about to smoke for the first time , it has raised its annual advertising another 15% to $35 million this year . <P> No More Hands . The young men lured by soft-as-smoke ads ( " With a cigar you will look smart " ) will be looking , surveys show , for roughly the same five-cent cigar that Thomas Marshall wanted . To provide it , and at the same time keep their earnings up , cigar makers are trying to eliminate costly hand operations . American Machine &; Foundry has perfected machinery to roll any type of cigar , uses reconstituted wrappers in which tobacco leaves have been destemmed and ground . If it can produce popular , machine-made cigars , the industry will indeed have a glowing future .
