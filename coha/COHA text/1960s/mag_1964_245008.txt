The yellowish , brassbound trunk not only moved-it talked . From its depths came kicks , wriggles , and a sepulchral voice pleading " Aiutatemi ! Salvatemi ! " ( Help me ! Save me ! ) . Porter Mario Colelli , who was loading freight into the rear baggage compartment of United Arab Airlines flight 784 to Cairo , recalls , " It was good Italian , real Italian Italian . Suddenly , I thought , ' My God , this is an Italian , and these Arabs are kidnaping him-some political fellow or something . Who knows what they 'll do to him down there in Cairo ! ' " <P> With the porter 's alarm at Rome 's Leonardo Da Vinci airport last week began an espionage yarn that grew steadily more hilarious to onlookers and more embarrassing to Egypt . <P> Well Packed . The trunk was addressed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Cairo , and had passed safely through customs because it was tagged " Diplomatic Mail . " When it began shouting for help , two Egyptian diplomats grabbed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the field . As police and customs officers tried to stop them , another Egyptian kept babbling that the trunk contained musical instruments and that the sounds probably were caused by accordions still filled with air . The truck raced away from the loading area , but it was soon caught by pursuing motorcycle police , who took the two nearly hysterical Egyptians and their baggage to a police station . When the cops opened the trunk they goggled at the contents : a slim , blond young man , strapped into an adjustable chair , with his head encased in a sort of crash helmet and his feet thrust into shoes nailed to the floor of the trunk . Small ventilating holes had been drilled into the sides to let him breathe . <P> <P> His story was that he was a Moroccan named Josef Dahan who had come to Rome from Naples to meet the two Egyptians at the Cafe de Paris on the opulent Via Veneto . He had apparently been slipped a doped drink and then hustled by car to the Egyptian Embassy , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was supposed to stay unconscious until he was well on the way to Cairo , but the plane was late . <P> <P> Double Career . The two diplomat-abductors were identified as Abdel Moneim el Neklawy and Selim el Saved , both first secretaries at Rome 's Egyptian embassy . Claiming diplomatic immunity , they were released by the police later that night , and , next day , the Italian government ordered them from the country as persona non grata . <P> Meanwhile , onionskins of identity were being peeled from the captive . He proved to be Mordecai Luk , 31 , a Moroccan-born Jew who had immigrated to Israel in 1949 , did his army service , married and fathered four children , and took up two professions : carpentry and crime . He has a record of five convictions , on charges ranging from forgery to criminal trespass . In 1961 he slipped out of Israel to Egypt and began an equally unsavory new existence making anti-Israel broadcasts over Radio Cairo . <P>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
