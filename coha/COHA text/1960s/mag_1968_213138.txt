IBERIA by James A. Michener. 818 pages . Random House . $10 . <P> <P> This hefty , meticulous report on the authors meanderings and experiences in Spain is , he says , " a 19th century English-style travel book . " Happily , it is that and much more . It is an unabashed celebration of an old infatuation with a country , and thus has the engaging , slightly breathless quality that is rarely found in modern travel books , now that the world has grown small . <P> James Michener first visited Spain as a chart boy aboard a freighter that hauled oranges from the eastern coast to the marmalade factories of Dundee . In the 35 years since then , he has returned repeatedly , both as a knockabout traveler and a rich tourist . In his book he makes no effort to prettify the country 's problems or ignore its faults . As long as Spain remains ruled by the army , the landed families and the church , he sees scant hope of any dramatic social or industrial progress-although he does grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is acerbic about the humiliating political strictures imposed by the Franco government , deplores the abrasive , remorseless poverty that makes even the dogs in the provinces scrawny and unlovable . Though he shares the passion of so many norteamericano writers for bullfighting , he also exposes it as a miserably corrupt racket whose only honorable figure all too often is the bull . <P> In spite of Michener 's long-windedness , no single book since V. S. Pritchett 's The Spanish Temper and Gerald Brenan 's The Face of Spain has succeeded so well in embracing the country 's history and culture , its natural and architectural milieu , and the quality of the Spanish character-which Michener sums up in one evocative word , duende , meaning " mysterious and ineffable charm . " All the immemorial sights are here too : the revelry following the feria at Seville , the impact of the roomful of Velzquez paintings at the Prado , the soaring , glowing Gothic church at Len , the splendor of the cathedral at Santiago de Compostela . Michener 's Tales of the South Pacific , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a competent if often heavy-footed popular novelist . His Iberia proves him a better Baedeker.
