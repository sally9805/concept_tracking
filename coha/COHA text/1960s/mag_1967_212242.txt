Princeton University Press . $10 . <P> On the eve of World War II , Greek Poet George Seferis took the measure of impending events and sadly quoted Germany 's pre-Romantic Poet Friedrich Holderlin : " What is the use of poets in a mean-spirited time ?

Greece 's only Nobel prizewinner is a deeply civilized and profoundly Greek man who draws on the whole heritage of his people , their literature , their myths and legends , their wariness born of defeat and exile , their toughness born of a stubborn struggle for survival .
