When a new-style missile is about to be fired at Florida 's Cape Canaveral , a small group of serious , weatherworn men examine it carefully . They learn how its parts fit together , what they are made of , what fuels its engines burn , where its " destruct " charge is placed and how it can be inactivated . The scientists who have nursed the missile to the testing stage watch the ceremony with some edginess ; they know that the weathered men are the " undertakers " of the missile world . Their job : fishing aborted missiles from the bottom of the sea . <P> Chief of the rocket retrievers is Louis Berger , 55 , who used to run a Florida barge line . In 1954 , when he heard that the Air Force needed a team of skilled men to recover missiles corpses , Berger bid for the contract and got it . Now he does his missile-age body snatching with three 65-ft. towboats manned by highly trained divers , navigators , sonar operators and other specialists . With missiles flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cracked-up bodies has become a scramble . <P> Whenever a firing is scheduled , Berger 's boats deploy off the Cape well in advance . One of their duties is to shoo away yachts , fishing boats , shrimpers or any other craft that might get hurt or see too much . If the missile plunges into the sea or is blown up by the range safety officer , the nearest Berger boat races toward the splash and looks for floating fuel , marker dye or other signs of the body 's location . <P> If there is no such clue , the tracking experts at the launching pad analyze the records of the missile 's flight and figure out where it probably landed . <P> <P> Combing the Bottom . Then Berger ' men go after the missile . Sometimes the body is in shallow water and easily visible from the surface . More often , it must be searched out by skindivers , mostly former Navy frogmen , who start from a buoy marking the most likely spot and comb the bottom around it . If the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom with shrimping nets . Another trick that often proves useful in clear water is to put a skin diver on a sled pulled by a boat . By working the sled 's vanes , he can make it dive and skim along just above the bottom . <P> Each aborted missile presents a different problem . Often its destruct charge is still unexploded and must be brought to the surface before it can be defused . Another hazard for divers is sharp edges of a missile 's torn steel . Sometimes the bod ) is still full of poisonous or explosive fuel Once a diver attached a line to an undamaged , unfired upper-stage rocket that could have taken off at any moment and rode it to the surface . Cried he : " I might have gone into orbit . " <P> If a missile stays on the bottom more than a few days , a different sort of problem develops : all kinds of sea creatures , including sharks and octopuses , move into the empty shell . When divers off Grand Bahama Island found a big booster that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to flush out of it four 6-ft. sharks . When they finally got the body on board , they discovered that it was also inhabited by more than 100 lobsters .
