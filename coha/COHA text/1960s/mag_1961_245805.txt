The first anniversary of the April 1960 riots that sent autocratic ex-President Syngman Rhee flying off to Hawaiian exile was drawing near . For weeks , Rhee 's successor , mild Premier John M. Chang , has been worrying over the prospect of nationwide demonstrations against his government on the anniversary . As one preventive , the Chang Cabinet proposed two bills to control street demonstrations and give the government more effective means of cracking down on South Korea 's illegal - - but active - Communist Party . Leftwing organizers , capitalizing on wide spread distrust of the two proposed bills , got busy without even waiting for anni versary day . <P> First they staged a four-hour anti-government rally in Seoul 's City Hall Plaza . Afterward , some of the assembled 8,000 headed for home , but others stayed on . Taking up torches and banners , the crowd surged through Seoul 's main streets , chanting , " Overthrow the Chang regime . " Cops in combat dress moved in and tried to seize the torches . An agitator yelled , " Kill the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before the dust had settled , the mob had destroyed two police Jeeps and stormed to within 200 yards of Chang 's residence ; 40 policemen and six demonstrators were injured , and 119 riot ers were arrested . <P> The following day there was another demonstration . More than 2,000 of South Korea 's 2,500,000 unemployed , many of them women with babies strapped to their backs , marched through the streets bearing banners : " Anti-Communism is fine , but we need three meals a day , too . " <P> As antigovernment rallies mushroomed all over South Korea , President Posun Yun summoned Democrat Chang and the leader of the opposition New Democratic Party to a midnight meeting at the presidential palace , and asked them to agree to a " political cease-fire " until such time as the government is free of danger of being overthrown from the extreme left . That day is a long way away in a war-weary nation where at least 25% of the labor force is out of work and where low wages , an inadequate food supply and a high birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
