txt The story of the farmWar ers in England who on waged such successful Rabbits germ warfare on their pestiferous rabbits , but with ultimate consequences not so happy , suggests a recurring shortsightedness . Now rid of the rabbits , except about five a normal thousand , the farmers discover new problems . The foxes and weasels have turned more fiercely against the henroosts , also have cut the squirrel population in half . It is true that various wild flowers , rare and practically extinct , have reappeared . The pastures , however , are overrun with a coarse grass that cattle reject , brambles begin to choke the fields , strange weeds spring up in the plowed ground ? all for lack of the nibbling rabbits . The farmers might have learned the old lesson an easier way . Australia had no Too Many rabbits , as first disand covered . Then about a Too Few hundred years ago the settlers , not quite at home without them , brought in a few . But there were also no carnivorous native beasts to feed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grazing lands , ruin the sheep industry and spread erosion . The settlers then introduced foxes , which also thrived prodigiously , devouring the native marsupials and birds along with rabbits . Next the proposal was weasels , but the Government balked . Poison was no good , for the native animals took to it . Barrier fences of wire netting proved useless . Expensive bounties served somewhat to hold down the foxes . The felt hat industry promised some help , although the number of human heads could not match the supply of rabbit fur . Between too many rabbits and too few , the golden mean remains to be found . Senator Neuberger has Planning a story of similar frusIt tration in the West . One Wrong of the pioneers was telling him about early days when coyotes were a plague to the sheep and chicken ranchers . Finally the ranchers put on a drive and as the old man told it , " We did them varmints in good . " But the coyotes among other things had been holding down the jack rabbits , which now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer could toss a handful of seed over his shoulder and proceeded to eat up the vegetable patches , worth just as much as the coyotes ' take of lambs . " We did n't look ahead very far , I guess , " said the pioneer . " We planned it wrong . " Correcting the blunBlunders ders of nature , and far of beyond the rabbitries , Nature has been man 's ' constant delight . North America was unprovided with English sparrows until a bird fancier about 1851 imported a few , and soon the Department of Agriculture was issuing bulletins on the sparrow pest and how to deal with it . The banks of the Bosporus in Turkey were a pollen-free summer refuge for the allergic until some lover of beauty decided to improve the scene with plantings of goldenrod . Generations of Americans cleared away the trees to get cropland , which has now washed away in gulleys , and others plowed up the prairies to plant wheat , thereby discovering the Dust Bowl . For today 's lawn improvement , one reads of a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than crab grass ? It seems just as well Nature to stop with fauna and and a flora without dragging Vacuum in politics ? the , sequence , for example , from Hitler to Stalin to Mao Tsetung . Nature clearly abhors a vacuum . Already we have reached the point at which our highest rating for a homesite is not " improved " but " unspoiled . " The most dedicated conservationist would hardly say that the earth before man tampered with it was a Disney paradise of smiling flowers and round-eyed fauns . Men of spirit will not forever bear the ills they have for fear of others they know not of . But when the time comes to unspoil what may remain from the spoilers  --  giving the land , as it were , back to the Indians ? it is going to be principally a case of science turning over the job to the economy of nature . Not being impatient about results , nature may give the next inhabitants an excellent new start .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
