If the Russians plan to try clandestine nuclear tests deep in space , they now have less chance than ever of getting away with it . Last week the U.S. orbited two vigilant satellites loaded with sensitive instruments capable of measuring X rays , gamma rays and neutrons from any source and any direction . Taking positions 65,000 miles up and on opposite sides of the earth , they joined a similar pair that was launched last October and has been performing far better than its builders had hoped . <P> The Department of Defense , which ordered the satellites from Space Technology Laboratories , and the Atomic Energy Commission , which supplied their instruments , insist that they are only innocent research devices aimed at learning how to detect atom tests in space . They are , in fact , a nuclear testing control system already in successful operation . The satellites launched last fall have been working perfectly three months longer than their expected life ; their builders think they will stay on the job for at least nine months more without giving trouble . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even longer life , and they carry more and better instruments . <P> Dr. Robert Frosch , director of the Pentagon 's Advanced Research Projects Agency , is sure by now that the present level of solar activity can not confuse even the earlier satellites into giving a false alarm . But this is the sun 's periodic quiet period ; when it goes back into its active condition in a few years , blossoms with sunspots and flares and bombards the earth with streams of high-energy particles , the satellites may send in some puzzling reports . " There are still a number of ambiguities that we know nothing about , " says Frosch . <P> Those first satellites , which orbit high above the normal Van Allen radiation belt , says Dr. James J. Coon of the AEC 's Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory , have detected peculiar cone-shaped clouds of negatively charged particles , presumably electrons , that trail the earth to an unknown distance , circling at the same speed with which the earth turns , so that they always remain on the side away from the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they follow the earth . Instruments on the newer satellites are designed to find out more about them . <P> Both the Pentagon and the AEC are sure that no nuclear test has been exploded in space since the first detector satellites were tossed into orbit . Their instruments would have detected even a small ( 20 kilotons ) explosion 100 million miles away and distinguished its effects from all kinds of natural radiation . This is believed to be a modest estimate of their capabilities . " How much better we can do now , " said an AEC official , " we 're not telling . "
