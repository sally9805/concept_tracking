Sanity of Kerouac VANITY OF DULUOZ by Jack Kerouac. 280 pages . Coward-McCann. $5.50 . <P> <P> How in the name of all the past and present editors of the Partisan Review did Jack Kerouac , cult leader of post-World War II intellectual vagrants , ever attain standing as a member ( let alone chieftain ) of the avantgarde ? Vanity of Duluoz , his best book , is a picaresque novel in a tradition as old as Tristram Shandy and about as avant-garde as Laurence Sterne-a man in holy orders , puckish though he was . <P> Actually an autobiography , the book tells of Kerouac 's rise ( in Lowell , Mass. ) , his fall ( on the high seas ) , and his moral death and resurrection in Manhattan . As a story , it is nothing much . Growing up , Kerouac accepts his household gods ( Breton ancestry and Roman Catholic religion ) , goes to school , plays football , goes to sea , and comes home shorn of vanity and , one is given to hope , restored to sanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Kerouac 's pal Claude who murders an obstreperous pansy . <P> Waifs &; Strays . This is fundamentally the story of all prodigals , and through it the book attempts to get to the heart of America as a country of wanderers - or as Evelyn Waugh put it , " a nation of waifs and strays . " <P> Norman Mailer is a novelist of essentially the same ail-American genre , but Mailer has developed a narcissistic devotion to his own quirks of mind ; Kerouac a far less talented man , nevertheless compels more respect for his dogged and humble concern to tell a plain tale and to explain himself , rather than demonstrate the wickedness or folly of others . Nor is Kerouac capable of the brutal vulgarity of a writer such as James Jones , whose books strike anyone of any sensitivity as weary , stale , flat-and profitable . <P> Unfortunately , Kerouac lacks the verbal talent to match his passionate commitment to the truth in himself . He suffers from a breathless style and the frequent burble of " fine writing . " His book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another monument brave in conception but botched by clumsy chisels . <P> Like Galileo . It is probably unfair to quote a slab of his prose to show what is unsatisfactory about his work ; to quote anything less is even more unfair because his prose comes in great untrimmed slabs . Sample : " But the mysterious beautiful thing of going to sea occurred that night : just a few hours after all that junk of bars , fighting , streets , subways , boom , there I am standing by the whipping shrouds and snapping lines in the Atlantic Ocean in the night off New Jersey , we 're sailing south to Norfolk to load on for Italy , everything is washed away by the clean sea . . . The stars are big , they rock side by side like Galileo drunk and Kepler stoned and Copernicus thinking , like Vasco da Gama in his bunk in thought , the wind , the cleanness , the dark , the quiet blue light in the bridge where hand holds wheel and course is set .
