Moscow protested that " the American brass has obviously set itself the task of creating a tense situation near the southern border of the Soviet Union . " The Russians indicated that any U.S. aircraft straying too close to Soviet territory would be shot down . Yet all such shouting was fully expected , and at week 's end the U.S. and Iran pushed right ahead with " Exercise Delawar , " *a training maneuver which assumes that Iran has asked the U.S. for help in stopping an invasion of its borders from the north . <P> For exercise purposes , Iran was called " Freeland " and , rather inappropriately , considering the conditions that prevail over much of well-refrigerated Russia , the invading forces were dubbed " Sun-land . " But since Iran shares 1,500 miles of its northern border with Russia , the name did not fool anyone . Staged in cooperation with the mideast CENTO military alliance and planned by U.S. General Paul Adams ' Tampa-based MEAFSA command ( see box ) , the war games were clearly designed to buck up a nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars in military assistance . Said one U.S. State Department planner : " We ought to show our muscle . There will be words and then it will be forgotten . " <P> As part of that show , three dozen F-100 fighters sped off their home runways at Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico on the 5,200-mile flight to Torrejon , Spain , then the 3,100-mile leg to Dezful , Iran , with frequent in-flight refueling by Strategic Air Command KC-135 tankers . Some 2,500 paratroopers of the 101st Airborne Division boarded twelve Military Air Transport Service C-135 jets at Kentucky 's Fort Campbell , landed at Adana , Turkey , in a miserable rain . There they switched to C-130s , their usual jump planes . From all over the U.S. , various cargo craft headed east with combat equipment . <P> Once in Iran , all forces of Exercise Delawar , including 2,500 U.S.-equipped Iranian troops , came under the command of Iranian Lieut . General Gholem Azhari . His first concern was to defend Vahdati airfield near Dezful against an enemy column theoretically bearing toward it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who dropped in front of the invaders . At the same time , a U.S. amphibious force in the Persian Gulf sent a marine rifle com pany storming onto the island of Kharg to protect an imaginary oilfield against invasion or sabotage . <P> After the landings , four days of maneuvers were scheduled in the mock war . While U.S. officers were interested in seeing how troops of the two nations would mesh in such a situation , the main point had already been made . It could hardly be missed either by the Soviet military strategists to the north or by Red Chinese forces threatening nearby India to the east : the U.S. is equipped to put a lot of troops anywhere , anytime-and fast . <P> <P> *In Persian , delawar means courageous .
