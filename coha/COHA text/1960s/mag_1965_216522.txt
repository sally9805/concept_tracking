Jean Mantelet was running a small plant that made hand-operated kitchen utensils when he decided ten years ago to try his luck with electric appliances . <P> He had his doubts . In fact , he labeled the first electric coffee mills off the assembly line " Moulin X " - literally , Mill X - to protect the reputation of his established firm , Moulin-Lgumes , in case the venture did not work out . It did , and Mantelet 's firm has since become France 's largest manufacturer of electrical appliances , proudly bearing the name Moulinex . Last week at Paris ' 34th International des Arts Menagers , where 1,800 appliance makers from 26 countries showed their wares , Moulinex took another step forward by announcing plans to add ten new household appliances to its present 24 products . <P> Moulinex is counting primarily on the appliance market 's still broad potential : 59% of French homes have no refrigerators , 63% no vacuum cleaners , 67% no hot-water heaters . Many of the smaller appliances in which Moulinex specializes - electric food grinders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to most French kitchens . Behind its slogan , " Moulinex liberates the woman , " the company is increasingly selling the French housewife on le confort . Its product line is also stretching beyond the kitchen , now includes electric heaters , vacuum cleaners and a $3.50 hair dryer that is one of the world 's fastest-selling models . <P> Though under orders to make the products simple and inexpensive , Moulinex researchers have also come up with some important technological advances . The latest : an asynchronous motor for appliances that does not cause static interference in radios and TV sets . <P> Despite its rapid growth ( 1964 sales : $40 million ) , Moulinex remains a strictly one-man operation . Jean Mantelet , dapper and youngish-looking at 64 , is president , general manager and principal ( 99% ) stockholder . No longer the reluctant risk taker , he now plans to increase his factories from four to seven within three years , double production , triple sales and raise exports from 30% to 50% of total sales . One special target is the biggest appliance market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . Last year Connecticut 's Scovill Manufacturing Co . ( Hamilton Beach products ) bought a small Lourdes company that makes coffee grinders , miners ' lamps and flashlights , and will now produce a broad line of appliances in France . " The government asked me to take it before the Americans did , " says Mantelet , " but I refused . " Scovill will not attempt to match Moulinex prices ; it believes instead that the French are ready to trade up . Mantelet is betting that the majority of French housewives will continue to choose Brand X.
