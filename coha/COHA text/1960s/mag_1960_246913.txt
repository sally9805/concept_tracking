BETWEEN THEN AND Now ( 160 pp. ) - Alba de Cspedes-Houghton Mifflin ( $3 ) . <P> <P> Alba de Cspedes writes so well about what it means to be a woman that she makes both male and female readers uneasy . She uses only one literary trick : unrelenting candor . And the only thing one can be sure of when her novels end is that life goes on . Daughter of a Cuban diplomat father and an Italian mother , Author de Cspedes writes with a Mediterranean mixture of controlled passion and shrugging resignation . <P> The Best of Husbands ( TIME , Dec. 29 , 1952 ) and The Secret ( TIME , Oct. 13 , 1958 ) dwelt on the theme that husbandly indifference is the most deadly of marriage-killing diseases . The heroine of her latest novel is not married at all , but she makes , ironically enough , a less than original discovery-that freedom from the conventional woman 's lot is almost the last thing a woman can bear . Outwardly , Irene 's life is enviable . She has left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own . Still attractive in her mid-30 's she earns her living as a journalist , has her own little flat , a lover , and a fierce contempt for wealthy , married , gadabout women like her own sister . <P> Yet in this dream world of the emancipated woman , something seems to be missing-in fact almost everything . Irene has left the church ; yet she envies those women who can sleep with a man and achieve real contrition at confession . Her lover respects her passion for freedom ; yet she is resentful because he has never shown a spark of jealousy , and fails to give their affair the color of romance . She is so wrapped up in her independence that she will not admit the womanly advantages of being a dependent . <P> Then Irene 's maid leaves . Author de Cspedes is so skilled that she can make this trite crisis the means of her restless heroine 's selfdiscovery . The maid , Erminia , is a simple village girl who likes her mistress but finds her life confusing . She leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyrant but at least leads a recognizable life : mistress of the house but subordinate to her husband , the master . Through Erminia 's desertion . Irene comes to see that tedious family convention is not necessarily more depressing than her own joyless burden of freedom . <P> Between Then and Now does not promise that , as a result of her new understanding , Irene will change completely . <P> Like the honest writer she is . Alba de Cspedes simply lets her heroine discover that a room of one 's own-and a man not quite one 's own-are not enough .
