The world still likes to know what Eisenhower thinks , and apparently he still thinks about everything that is going on-and some things that are history . Last week on CBS 's Eisenhower on the Presidency , he ranged the field : <P> ON RIGHT-WING EXTREMISTS . " Anybody that wants to go back to eliminating the income tax from our laws , and the rights of people to unionize , who is advocating some form of dictatorship , that is the kind of person that I label extremist . Possibly their motivation is an avid desire for distinction . They attack people of good repute and who are proved patriots , to get their names in the headlines . I do n't think the U.S. needs superpatriots . We need patriotism , honestly practiced by all of us , and we do n't need these people that are more patriotic than anybody else . That 's just rot , if you 'll excuse the word . " <P> ON MILITARY OFFICERS . " I do believe that our officers , when they receive recruits , have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , understanding that they are defending the U.S. and the things for which she stands . I do not believe they should try to do this in terms of partisan politics whatsoever . When I was a young officer , I never heard of any Army officer being put under oath , testifying before the Congress . Now , since some of these odd investigations , this has become a practice . And if an officer is asked for his personal opinion and it happens to disagree with his President 's , well , he has to express it . It 's bad practice-very bad . " <P> ON THE FALL OF DIENBIENPHU . " Now the French command made a very bad military mistake and should not have made it but they did . At the last minute they said this commander wanted American air force to come in there and intervene . Well , I could n't think of anything probably less effective than in a great big jungle area and with a besieged fortress , trying to relieve it with air force . I just ca n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use weapons that could have destroyed the jungles all around the area for miles and that would have probably destroyed Dienbienphu itself , and that would have been that . " <P> ON U.S. INTERVENTION IN HUNGARY . " You could n't have jumped over Germany , Austria or France , or any other direction , and gone in there , because it would not have been allowed . I do n't believe that we had the support of the United Nations to go in and make this a full-out war . The thing started in such a way that everybody was a little bit fooled , and when suddenly the Soviets came in in strength with their tank divisions and it was a fait accompli , it was a great tragedy and disaster . " <P> ON U.S. SUEZ POLICY . " It was very difficult because here were our very finest friends involved . I had many communications with Mr. Eden , who was then Prime Minister , and I said , ' We 're not going to destroy the United Nations , and the United Nations says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' But our action was misunderstood . The British press said that we had let them down . We had n't , because we told the government exactly what we would do , but that was not publicized there . I think in the long run it has turned out to be a very fine decision . "
