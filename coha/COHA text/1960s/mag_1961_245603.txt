Softspoken , middle-sized , myopic Marshall Field Jr. , 44 , has the mild , diffident mien of a church usher . Ho neither looks nor acts like a fighter , but the publisher of the Chicago Sun-Times and Daily News is enthusiastically engaged in a scrap . What is more , he picked it . With his two papers , Field is hurling a daily challenge at the late Robert Rutherford McCormick 's big and powerful morning Tribune . <P> These days , Field handles his end of the fight with increasing assurance and effect . The Trib ( circ. 869,958 ; still dominates Chicago , but Challenger Field is making long strides . His Sun-Times ( 566,219 ) is gaining circulation on the Trib and is taking the new advertising at three times the Trib 's rate . Field 's two papers produce an annual net profit of $2,000,000-a figure that Field confidently expects to rise to $3,000,000 before the end of the year . <P> Dignity for the Peanut Gallery . Field 's success as a Chicago publisher is due in part to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last practitioners of firebrand personal journalism , McCormick hoisted the Trib to greatness on his own inexhaustible choler ; when he died in 1955 , succession passed to men who possessed neither the qualifications nor the will to carry on in the colonel 's style . As the Tribune 's tumult lessened , Chicagoans began to hear another newspaper voice . It belonged to Marshall Field 's Sun-Times . <P> The Sun-Times voice is very much the echo of the reserved and unassuming man who runs it . It is the most intellectual and unsensational tabloid in the U.S. ; on Sundays it carries a " dignity section ' ' - Field 's own idea-full of thoughtful articles on educational techniques , the constitutional aspects of the Presidency , and the agenda of the last U.N . General Assembly session . Two years ago , when Field bought the Daily News from John Knight , he was advised to reach for a mass market with the tabloid Sun-Times and to aim the News at quality readership . Field disagreed . " Newspapers outside of New York , " said he firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the peanut gallery . " <P> Yachts , Grouse &; Newspapers . Marshall Field Jr . was not always that decisive , and the Sun-Times not always that moderate . The paper began its life in 1941 as the Chicago Sun , the creation of Field 's father , Marshall Field III . Heir to a department store fortune accumulated by his grandfather , the senior Field was also a fervent New Dealer and devotee of liberal causes . He founded his paper mainly to give battle to McCormick 's ultraconservative , Roosevelt-baiting Tribune . The paper was something of a flop . By 1950 , after turning the Sun into a tabloid , merging it with the Chicago Times and spending $10 million of his own money , the elder Field had succeeded only in evoking the colonel 's amusement ( " Marshall Field is an authority on horse racing , yacht racing and grouse shooting , but he knows little about newspapers " ) . Marshall Field III apparently agreed with his competitor ; he declared the Sun-Times an " economic impossibility " and installed his son as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
