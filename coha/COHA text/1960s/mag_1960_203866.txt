The teenagers , in jeans , flashy shirts and black leather motorcycle jackets , surrounded the trembling old man and jeered as he stripped off his clothes at their command . When his underwear was gone and he stood naked , the kids grinned , turned and strutted away . Suddenly one of the gang , 14 years old and illiterate , spun round and stalked back . " Here 's something for you to wear , " he snarled , brutally stabbing the old man twice , and leaving him critically injured . Packs of out-of-control teenagers , out for kicks or cash , are terrorizing Santiago , Chile . The Chileans call them colricos-angry ones . <P> Their costume-jeans , plaid shirt , jacket-is their trademark . Those who can afford it ride sputtering convoys of motor scooters , complete with snug-sweatered girl friends perched behind . Besides the slashers and the holdup artists , there are the bobby-soxers and song faddists , who burst into Los Cerrillos airport last month to greet Canadian Rock-'n ' - Roller Paul Anka , causing $25,000 worth of damage before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Anka , who affects boyish dignity and grey flannel suits , looks like a Boston banker compared to the Chileans ' own pride , a character in far sharper threads who bills himself as Peter Rock . An exponent of the guitar-whanging , hip-swiveling school , Rock packs them into the smoky dens , where colericos meet to beat , and is said to lead a powerful pack of toughs himself . <P> On the colricos ' right wing , a group of introspective jeans-wearers have " found " themselves-and are busily analyzing the drives and motives of angry ones still lost . Like others of their kind around the world , they blame the aimless drifting on a lack of a creed or an ideal to believe and work for . <P> To the left is another group of colricos who have found themselves . This ardent band meets almost nightly in an old two-story building in downtown Santiago only a block away from Congress and three blocks from the presidential palace . They dance to rock-'n ' - roll music like the rest , but they have a purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their parties are held to raise funds for the Communist Youth Movement , and they confine their rumbles to times of social uproar , when they take to the streets to lead bus-burning , window-smashing attacks on the government .
