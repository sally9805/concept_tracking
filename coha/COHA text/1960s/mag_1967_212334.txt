For many years , the best friend and trusted confidant of Egypt 's Gamal Abdel Nasser was the chief of his armed forces , Field Marshal Abdel Hakim Amer . But the two had a serious falling out after Egypt 's disastrous defeat by Israel in June , and in September , while under house arrest for allegedly plotting a military coup , Amer either committed suicide-the official version of his death - or was killed . After his death , intelligence agents of another Arab state obtained in Cairo a 14-page document said to be Amer 's last testament . Though the Middle East makes a business of forgery , sources who knew Amer well and have read the document claim that on the basis of its style , opinions and signature , it is unmistakably Amer 's . It not only criticizes Nasser but offers strong indication that Amer was murdered . Excerpts : <P> <P> WE involved ourselves in a war with Israel without wanting it , without taking the initiative and without planning it or choosing its date . It was not enough for Gamal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility for the defeat . " We can carry out our responsibilities only when we explain to the people how the decisions that led to the destruction of our army were taken . That is why I offered my resignation . Many friends and colleagues tried to convince me that the decision was hasty . Others spread news about me that I was suffering from deep psychological crisis and that I attempted suicide several times . But who had not suffered a psychological crisis after the catastrophe that befell us ? As for suicide , it is the farthest from my mind , because that would be running away from responsibility and from facing it with courage and frankness . <P> His Excellency , the President , surprised me when , before going to the Arab Summit Conference , he invited me to his house and informed me that security forces would arrest me . " Brother , " he said , " reports that I receive say that a large number of officers were seen entering and leaving your house . This endangers the regime . I do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end to the visits . " <P> I swore by my honor that the visits had nothing to do with politics . " Gamal , " I told him , " if I had wanted to seize power I would not have resigned in June . And if you still doubt my intentions , I am prepared to prove my innocence before any military court . " He said that this was not possible . I asked if he was ordering me to keep silent about events leading up to the war . " Yes , " he said . I answered that I could not keep silent because it would be a betrayal of my duty and military honor . He said , " You better think it over a second time . " <P> <P> Now that it is too late , I realize that the President neglected Egypt altogether , and that that is the cause of our failure . We should have looked after our people instead of getting involved in others ' revolutions and wars and squandering thousands of millions of pounds . We destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and history in the hands of the devil . We made many mistakes , but the biggest mistake we made was that we did not admit those mistakes . <P>
