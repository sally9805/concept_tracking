Perhaps 2,200 of the Episcopal Church 's 9,000 ministers are in need of pastoral counseling because of frustration in their jobs , estimates the Rt . Rev. Chandler W. Sterling . Properly appalled by this gloomy statistic , Bishop Sterling is now planning what he hopes will become a nationwide rehabilitation program for troubled clergymen , to be known as PARDON. * A dropout from the diocesan ministry himself , Sterling , 57 , resigned last October as Bishop of Montana because he felt " completely frustrated in my work . " A zealous Christian activist , he was discouraged by the failure of Montana Episcopalians to support such measures as laws against racial discrimination in housing , and the organization of urban ministries . <P> As Sterling views it , all too many clergymen suffer from similar frustrations . Often , he says , it is the " maddening nothingness of their contemporary ministry " that drives clerics to abandon the pulpit ; those who resist such pressures frequently become ineffective victims of " overstay " in their parishes . Compounding their plight , disturbed priests are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bishops or parishioners . <P> With support from the Anglo-Catholic American Church Union , of which he is president , Sterling will open his first rehabilitation center in Manhattan 's Greenwich Village this spring , hopes to set up five more by 1970 . PARDON will accept clergymen of any faith , find them living quarters and temporary secular jobs while they undergo up to 90 days of pastoral counseling provided by ministers with lengthy parish experience . Those in need of psychiatric care will be referred to hospitals and clinics . Sterling expects that at least a third of his clients will use PARDON as a " halfway house " to ease their transition to secular life-but the rest , he hopes , may be able to return to the ministry with a renewed sense of zeal . <P> <P> * Standing , in good acronymic tradition , for Pastors ' Anonymous Recovery-Directed Order for Newness.
