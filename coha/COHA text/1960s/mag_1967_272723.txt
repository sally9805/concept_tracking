The New Hampshire primary , first chicane of the 1968 political grand prix , is still three months off , but already Michigan 's Governor George Romney , the G.O.P. 's only major official entrant to date , is coughing and sputtering . Last week , revving up inexorably for a January announcement of his candidacy , Richard Nixon moved into the unenviable spot of " the man to beat . " <P> In New Hampshire , State Republican Chairman John Palazzi reported Nixon leading Romney by as much as 3 to 1 . In Wisconsin , which will hold the nation 's second primary April 2 , polls show the former Vice President leading Romney by some ten percentage points . <P> Nixon 's current ascendancy is based partly upon an absence of new declarations in the G.O.P. ranks . Nelson Rockefeller , whom top Democrats regard as the most formidable threat to Lyndon Johnson next year , professes with diminishing credibility that he is not interested in being President . More important , Nixon has gained widespread acquiescence to the idea of his candidacy . Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herculean campaign labors , have come to view him as an acceptable candidate who at least would not sunder the party as Barry Goldwater did three years ago-even though some doubt that he could win . <P> <P> Image to Shuck . To try to shuck his loser 's image , Nixon hopes for accelerating primary triumphs in New Hampshire , Wisconsin , Oregon and Nebraska . His aides say that he may also enter other state primaries against favorite-son Republicans . Nixon forces are banking , optimistically , on a first-or second-ballot victory at the convention . <P> Last week , in a bid for broad party support and accord with the Republicans ' Eastern Establishment , Nixon turned up at a Manhattan fundraising dinner that amassed some $300,000 for New York 's liberal Senator Jacob Javits-the first official New York G.O.P. function that Nixon has attended since moving there four years ago from California . While Rockefeller and New York Mayor John Lindsay listened with fixed smiles , Nixon warmly endorsed Javits for re-election next year . Ironically , the potentially most powerful bloc in the G.O.P. is musclebound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending a conference in Palm Beach last week , failed to unite behind any one candidate-although as many as 15 or 20 of them favor Rockefeller . <P> The Governors also ran into stubborn resistance from the congressional wing of the party over the 1968 G.O.P. platform . They demanded that a moderate from their ranks be made co-chairman of the platform committee , serving on a par with the almost certain congressional spokesman , Illinois ' Senator Everett Dirksen . Wisconsin 's Melvin Laird , chairman of the House Republican Conference and the conservative who chaired the 1964 platform committee , rejected the Governors ' overtures , leaving unsettled what the tone of the 1968 G.O.P. platform will be and the kind of candidate who will be chosen to run on it .
