No. 22 , Intrepid , is the only completely new 12-meter to be built in the U.S. for the forthcoming America 's Cup defense against Australia 's Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron . Her designer : Olin J. Stephens II , who also designed the successful American defenders Ranger ( 1937 ) , Columbia ( 1958 ) and Constellation ( 1964 ) . Her skipper : Emil ( Bus ) Mosbacher Jr. , successful defender of the America 's Cup with Weatherly in 1962 against the Australians ' Gretel . Her owners : The Intrepid Syndicate , headed by William J. Strawbridge. // The new boat 's most unusual external features are her short overall length ( less than 64 feet ) , her long sailing waterline , a " knuckle " in the profile of her bow and her two rudders : one hung aft on a skeg , to be used only for steering ; the other hung farther forward and lower on the aft edge of the keel , to be used as a " trailing edge flap " in much the same manner as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked together to give the boat a smaller turning radius for maneuvering in close quarters . Intrepid 's weight distribution , moreover , is unusually well centered and unusually low , because of a novel winch arrangement devised by Stephens and Mosbacher that puts the winch grinders out of sight below deck . // Intrepid 's only serious competition for the honor of defending the cup so far has been provided by American Eagle ( U.S. 12 No. 21 , built in 1964 , and runner-up that year to Constellation in the Final Trials for selection of an American defender against the British ) . Eagle was designed by Bill Luders . Her new skipper is George R. Hinman , formerly commodore of the New York Yacht Club and formerly president of the North American Yacht Racing Union . Her owners : The American Eagle Syndicate , comprising many members but headed by Reynolds duPont , Clayton Ewing and H. Irving Pratt . Eagle 's improvements since 1964 include the changing of her keel cross section to a modern V at the bottom ; reduced rudder area ; the moving of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . These changes will permit her to carry larger jibs , a spinnaker pole two feet longer and will provide a higher-aspect-ratio mainsail . Eagle also has special " exotic " standing rigging that gives her less windage and less weight aloft than any other 12-meter . This equipment was donated in 1964 by the Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corporation but was not used on American Eagle until this year . // The other 12s sailing against Eagle and Intrepid in the Preliminary Trials on Long Island Sound two weeks ago were Eagle 's old rival , Constellation , and the 1962 defender , Weatherly . Constellation , No. 20 , was built in 1964 and successfully defended the America 's Cup that year against the British , under the skillful helming of Bob Bavier Jr . Chartered from her new owners and brought back from Europe by the Intrepid Syndicate , she is serving as a trial horse for Intrepid under Skipper Robert W. McCullough . She was competing virtually unchanged , except for the hard use given her original sails during the past two years abroad . // Weatherly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cup four years later with Bus Mosbacher at the helm . Chartered by T. Patrick Dougan as a summer-long trial horse for his almost completely rebuilt Columbia , which had not yet arrived on the East Coast from California in time for the Preliminary Trials , she was serving as a stand-in for the California boat and a training ship for Helmsman Briggs Cunningham and his crew . // Such being the case , any attempt to predict now which U.S. 12-meter boat will eventually be selected to defend the cup in September off Newport , R.I. is like attempting to pick the winner of a baseball game after watching the teams warm up . But I 'll try . // An America 's Cup race is like a wrestling match  --  just two contestants , each trying to get a grip on the other . The wrestling can begin up to 10 minutes before the start of the race itself , and at the starting gun neither contestant really cares how late he is at the line as long as his opponent is later . Paired against Weatherly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the line before the gun and subsequently pulled into a huge lead upwind . Then , on the second leg , Intrepid somehow failed to defend herself properly , and old Weatherly , heading higher into a new breeze , actually led the brand new boat at the next mark . But the miracle faded fast when Weatherly failed to work back into the stronger part of the new breeze , thus allowing Intrepid to sail around her into a lead of 1:36 at the third mark . Coming home to the finish on a beam reach in a freshening breeze , Weatherly wisely refrained from setting a spinnaker . Intrepid , however , set hers , then had trouble getting it down . Result : Weatherly gained 0:46 on the final leg , to lose by only 0:50 over 23 ? miles  --  a moral victory for the old girl , if not an actual one . // In the second race , first pairing , Intrepid came close to being out maneuvered on the starting line by American Eagle , but got the better start at the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intrepid relentlessly widened her lead , until on the second leg she committed a kind of error never seen before in 12-meter racing on Long Island Sound : she rounded the wrong buoy ! By the time Eagle showed Intrepid her mistake and Intrepid retraced her track to rectify the error , Eagle had the race sewed up with a lead of over half a mile . Throughout the remaining 17 miles of the course , however , Intrepid did gain time on Eagle on every leg , finishing only 1:02 behind . Eagle supporters were outwardly jubilant ; but in their hearts they must have sensed that it was another example of the tortoise beating the hare . // When Constellation met Intrepid in the third race , the start was memorable for the fact that McCullough definitely outmaneuvered Mosbacher  --  the only clear-cut loss of a start suffered by Mosbacher in all his eight races . Intrepid won the race , however , by 1:44. // A notable highlight of the racing was the tremendous superiority of Intrepid over American Eagle in the eighth and final race when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on every leg of the course to win by the crushing margin of 5:34  --  a lot of distance in a wind of whitecap strength . In the other pairing in that breeze , Constellation beat Weatherly by 1:47. // On the windward legs , no boat was anywhere near the equal of the new Intrepid , either in pointing or in footing . And such superiority will count all the more in the final trials off Newport , where half of the six legs on the America 's Cup course are dead to windward . // To leeward , Intrepid from time to time was gained upon by some of the older boats in light air . But in the fresher breezes she was as supreme in running as she was to windward . // In scoring the total wins and losses of each boat in the eight races each sailed , Intrepid dominated the fleet , followed by American Eagle , Constellation and Weatherly in that order . Referring to his one loss to Eagle when he rounded the wrong buoy , Bus generously said , " Olin Stephens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight races for us  --  till we chose that wrong buoy .... " // As to my predictions of what is likely to happen later this summer off Newport : a ) For U.S. defender , barring further catastrophes like the loss of a mast , it looks as if Intrepid will simply select herself  --  except that Columbia is a revitalized unknown that just might make a contest out of the Final Trials ; b ) For the America 's Cup match itself , I pick the American defender to be successful against the Australian challenger . Sorry , Dame Pattie , but that 's the way I see it .
