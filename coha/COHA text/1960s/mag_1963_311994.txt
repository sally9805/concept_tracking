Harold Macmillan valiantly tried to divert Britain 's mind from sex and security . Displaying something like his old form in the House of Commons , he delivered an eloquent speech on prospects for disarmament and a summit conference that was received respect fully even by the Opposition . But Macmillan 's eloquence could not diminish Tory distress over the three separate scandals that plagued his government . <P> First , of course , was the continuation of the Profumo Case . In Marylebone Magistrates ' Court , Osteopath Stephen Ward , mentor of Christine Keeler and friend of disgraced War Secretary John Profumo , was ordered to stand trial on seven charges of procuring , arranging abortions , and living off the earnings of prostitution . By the close of the three-day hearing , Magistrate Leo Gradwell had permitted numerous witnesses to testify without revealing their identity , even allowed one witness to leave the courtroom shrouded in a topcoat . <P> Next , there was the case of Italian Nuclear Physicist Giuseppe Enrico Martelli , who denied at the Old Bailey last week that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary , for seven years he had resisted Russian pressure to become a Red agent . But the Crown contended that Martelli was caught with shoes that had hollowed-out secret compartments in the heels and that his cigarette packages contained wafer-thin pads with secret codes and passwords . Finally , there was the case of Harold Adrian Russell Philby , journalist , ex-Foreign Office official , and boon companion of Communist Spies Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean , whose reappearance in the news recalled the most notorious of Britain 's sex-and-spy scandals . <P> Out of Sight .

When Burgess and Maclean eloped to Russia in 1951 , Philby was forced to resign from the Foreign Office amidst a flurry of rumors that he was " the third man " who had tipped them off that the police were on their trail . Later , this charge was indignantly denied by Harold Macmillan , then Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Foreign Office even asked the Observer to hire Philby as a correspondent because " it seemed unfair that so able a man should be finding difficulty in earning a living now that he had clearance from the Foreign Secretary . " <P> The publication took the hint and , along with the Economist , sent Philby to the Middle East , where his father , St. John Philby , the famed Arab scholar , had spent years exploring the desert . <P> But last January , beset with financial and alcohol problems , Philby suddenly disappeared from his Beirut home . <P> Last week , in the Commons , Lord Privy Seal Edward Heath revealed that Philby had surfaced " in one of the countries of the Soviet bloc . " New information had come to light , said Heath , that revealed that Philby had been a Soviet agent while working for the government and in fact had been the tipster who had warned Burgess and Maclean . <P> To the House , Macmillan praised Britain 's security services for coming up with the new information-overlooking the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
