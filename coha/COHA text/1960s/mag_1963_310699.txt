In South Bend , on a cold grey day with gently descending snow , workers poured from the plant in shock and anger . In Hamilton , Ont. , the news was greeted with elation , and men quickly lined up to apply for jobs . Across the U.S. , 1,900 dealers sat in their showrooms and forlornly surveyed an uncertain future . In a move long expected but nonetheless shocking when it came , Studebaker Corp . announced that it was dropping auto production in the U.S.-111 years after its founding as a carriage maker and 61 since it turned out its first auto . The company insisted that it will continue to produce autos in its Canadian plant for the U.S. market , but hardly anyone took Studebaker 's small future in autos too seriously . <P> Since the first auto was produced in 1893 , some 1,850 U.S. auto firms have gone out of business , two of them ( Packard and Kaiser ) since World War II . Studebaker 's departure from fifth place leaves the U.S. with only four major auto producers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studebaker Chairman Randolph Guthrie , a partner in the Wall Street law firm that Richard Nixon recently joined . Guthrie has his own explanation for why Studebaker flopped in one of history 's best auto years . " The reason , " he says , " is that everyone thought that Studebaker was going out of business . " <P> Unhappy Event . Though anticipated , Studebaker 's decision was an unhappy event for many . More than 7,000 men and women will lose their jobs in Studebaker 's 6,000,000-sq. - ft . South Bend plant . Part of the engineering and design staffs will move to Hamilton , and only 900 production workers will be kept on in South Bend to produce some of the parts for the Canadian assembly plant . Realizing that Studebaker 's future was precarious , the city of South Bend has been diversifying its industrial base for several years to cushion the shock ; Studebaker has recently accounted for only 3% of the city 's total payroll . Still , that payroll amounted to some $600,000 a week , and its loss will be intensified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studebaker 's dealers had no such cushion . With the high-priced Avanti sports car , the medium-priced Hawk and all commercial trucks discontinued , they can still sell the low-priced Studebaker sedans that will be made in Hamilton . But business has been so bad recently that it could hardly get worse after last week 's announcement . <P> Caring for " Orphans . " One problem for the dealers is the 22,500 Studebakers in stock . An auto-buying public is understandably reluctant to buy what the trade calls " orphans " ( like the discontinued Edsel ) . Studebaker has attempted to get around this by promising that parts will be available for all its present models . Even so , prices of the remaining autos will almost certainly have to be slashed to attract buyers . Studebaker has tried to escape the anger of its dealers by continuing the Ontario operation and thus technically fulfilling its contract to supply its dealers with autos.
