THE UNEXPECTED UNIVERSE by Loren Eiseley. 239 pages . Harcourt , Brace &; World . $5.75 . <P> <P> " It is very seldom that the same man knows much of science , and about the things that were known before ever science came , " Lord Dunsany once remarked , with both British and scientific understatement . Loren Eiseley is one such **28;3310;TOOLONG man for all cultures . A writer of literary distinction ( The Immense Journey , The Mind as Nature ) as well as a front-rank anthropologist , he is one of the few living scientists who can contemplate evolution and think of the Odyssey as the immediately appropriate metaphor . Somehow Eiseley has absorbed all the New Information while retaining a pre-scientific sense of wonder . <P> In fact , that is precisely Eiseley 's argument in this curious book : If science ignores the ancient intuitions of poets and primitives , it is likely to become an arrogant distortion of its own truth . Practicing the sensibility he preaches , Eiseley begins each chapter under the guise of an old-fashioned personal essayist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the odd behavior of his shepherd dog one stormy winter night , a dig among American rhinoceros bones . <P> Despite his modern choice of literary form , Eiseley is perceptively ambitious . Taken together , these introspective pieces comprise nothing less than a corrective statement on the modern view of the universe and the human priorities set within it . Like a latterday , lab-trained Hamlet , Eiseley confronts his fellow scientists with the charge that there are more things in heaven and earth than is dreamt of in their philosophy . His book is one long repeated warning that " the wild reality always eludes our grasp . " <P> The Heart 's Solitude . Increasingly , he notes , " there is but one way into the future : the technological way . " Again and again , he tries to sober us up about the Great White Prophets in smocks . The new faith in computers , he warns , has made us forget the old wisdom of fairy tales : there is a frontier to man 's kingdom where " predictability ceases and the unimaginable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man with the fury of an underground resistance fighter . " Each one of us , " he writes in a cry from the heart , " is a statistical impossibility around which hover a million other lives that were never destined to be born . " <P> If anything , science has made man more of a mystery to himself . For in conquering the universe , says Eiseley , man has got curiously out of touch with it : " His march is away from his origins . . . From the solitude of the wood he has passed to the more dreadful solitude of the heart . " Once or twice he seems on the verge of promulgating an Eiseley law : The more science expands the universe , the more it shrinks man . <P> As far as the technological future goes , Eiseley has little doubt that the standard rule of civilization will continue to apply : " Solutions to problems create problems . " As if it were perverse salvation , he clings to a classically tragic vision of life . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change that .
