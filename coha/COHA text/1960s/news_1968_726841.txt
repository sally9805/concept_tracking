txt WASHINGTON ? President Johnson 's new balance of payments program announced last week was the most drastic in a series of measures that began as long ago.as 1959 ? and have so far failed to cure the payments deficit . For the first time the Government will directly control new business investments abroad , with an outright cutoff for investments in Western Europe . For the first time also a President said : " I am asking the American people to defer for the next two years all nonessential travel outside the Western Hemisphere . " This appeal will be backed by a still unspecified proposal to tax travel outside the hemisphere , possibly a " per diem " tax on the number of days a traveler spends abroad . Subsidy Program In:the works is a new program to subsidize U.S. exports slightly by rebating state and local property and receipts taxes that add to the price of manufactured goods  --  a rebate permitted by the international trading rules and long practiced by other countries . Already underway is new pressure on European nations to offset the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchasing more U.S. arms or buying . special Treasury bonds . The reason for the President 's action was really threefold. ( 1 ) After dropping to the relatively low level of $1.35-billion in 1965 and 1966 , the balance of payments deficit started to get worse again starting in the second quarter of last year . ( 2 ) It worsened drastically in the fourth . quarter , partly because of side effects of the devaluation of the British pound . Thus for the year the deficit , still not fully calculated , will be more than $3.5-billion. ( 3 ) A big reduction in the United States deficit will be a precondition for European approval of activation of the new plan for " paper gold , " called special drawing rights , agreed on at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund last September in " Rio de Janeiro . The balance of payments , of course , , has numerous do'Mponents , and no one item can be said to account for  --  the deficit . However ; the war in Vietnam has for the last three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar outflow of $1.5-billion in 1967 . The underlying menace of the deficit , of course , is that it produces a steady drain on the country 's monetary reserves , mainly gold , and builds up foreign dollar holdings as a potential claim on the $12-billion of remaining gold . The Treasury announced a further gold loss of $450-million only last week . Will the President 's program work ? Some Measures Doubtful It is aimed at an improvement of at least $3-billion the balance of payments in 1968 . Some parts of this improvement appear certain , others are likely and a few are open to doubt . Half of the total , or $1.5-billion , will come from much tighter controls on the flow of capital abroad . The moratorium on new corporate investment in Europe , together with new limits on investment in most other parts of the world , is bound to produce a big saving . The estimate of $1-billion in this category of investment , which is also based on new controls requiring repatriation of a good part of foreign earnings ; ' should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $500-million savings from a reduced ceiling on bank loans to foreigners , the ' other category of investments affected by the program , though this part of it will remain voluntary . The appeal of the President to Americans to stay in this hemisphere would strike mainly at travel in Western Europe. , : Travel expenditures by Ameri-. cans in Europe amounted to about $1.3-billion last year , and ' if the whole estimated $500-mi1-lion saving from the new program fell there it would amount ' to a cut of 40 per cent in European travel . Over - all , Americans spent about $4-billion in foreign travel . last year but the travel deficit was only $2-billion because foreigners spent $2-billion here . Another $500 - million is. planned in the area of military expenditures abroad , mainly through offsets in the form of foreign purchases of either arms or Treasury bonds here . This might be approached if not achieved . Significantly President Johnson did not order any troop reductions ? certainly not in . Vietnam , where the biggest drain is , and not in Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in exports . This again is just al guess , but the United States intends to take unilateral action : in the tax field as a spur to , ex- ' ; ports if negotiations with other countries for a change in the : present international rules do ' not succeed . It was clear the President had to do something , and he did it. : The results will emerge only ' over time .
