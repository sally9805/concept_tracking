" / ' D like to have all views expressed in the Post , especially now that we 're alone in the afternoon field , " Dorothy Schiff , owner and publisher of the New York Post , whose survival of the Sun , the World-Telegram A , and the Jour-nal-merican  --  not to mention , in the morning field , the Herald Tribune and the Mirror  --  has been a big journalistic surprise , told an interviewer a while ago , during the first of several lengthy chats . " I think we have too many feature writers saying the same thing . Jimmy Wechsler James A. Wechsler , the Post 's editor from 194-9 to 1961 and since then its editorial-page chief and one of a stable of cilium-rusts , who currently add up to around thirty recommended Bill Buckley to me some time ago , when Bill 's agent was shopping around for a New York outlet for his column " On the Right " . I said no . Later , I saw him on TV and thought he was provocative . By then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So we got him after the WorldJournal-Tribune folded a year ago last May . I do n't think his column is provocative enough often enough . I told him so the other day , and he seemed surprised . We 're considered a left-wing paper , and I think he was afraid that if he was too provocative we 'd drop him . His column is syndicated in over two hundred papers , but he likes to be in the Post because it gives him a chance to reach the opposition . I like him to be there because he is really the only Satan in the intellectual establishment . " Mrs. Schiff lit a cigarette , and went on , " As a rule , we drop columnists only if they 're inaccurate or dull . ' Nc do n't drop them for their political views . Personal journalism lives in the columns . I 'm in favor of personal journalism . I have also always wanted the news to give both sides . I do n't think we should be pamphleteers . The editorial page is something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . It 's difficult . There 's no such thing as objectivity , of course . Most writers are inclined to he crusaders , or to the left . I 'm not as politically excitable as I used to be . On November 3 , 1958 , the day before Election Day and a week after the Post , following some soul-searching , had finally come out for Averell Harriman for governor , Mrs. Schiff devoted the entire first page of the final edition to a last-minute message headed " To Post Readers , " in which she repudiated Harriman on the ground that he had unfairly charged his opponent , Nelson Rockefeller , with being pro-Arab and anti-Israeli ; in the paper 's list of endorsements the space for governor was left blank . The Rockefeller forces bought up thousands of copies of the issue and distributed them over the lower East Side . I do n't think that I myself am a crusader . Jimmy Wechsler is , and I 've gone along with him many times . He has such a quick mind . He is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about something , he says , ' Why do n't you just order me It 's the last thing I want to do . I am more skeptical than he is . I 'm not sentimental at all , though I can cry , as I do sometimes at movies on TV . I 'm not sentimental about human beings . FIT acquired a skepticism about some of the people for whom we have carried the banner . " Mrs. Schiff remarked that the Post 's average daily circulation had risen from four hundred thousand to seven hundred thousand since its emergence as the only evening newspaper in town . " I noticed that we were sold out by midafternoon today on the stand downstairs , " she said , referring rather grandly to a newsstand around the corner on Lexington Avenue from her apartment building , in the East Sixties , where the talk was taking place in a duplex penthouse she has owned since 1943 . " This al-ways annoys me . I think news dealers should get all the copies they can sell . I think we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very intense and dangerous chase . " Manhunt for Triple Killer , " the story 's head-line read . I have popular taste myself . I 'm a good guinea pig . I generally feel the way the ma-jority of people feel . Crime sells better than housing , say . I 'm in-terested in gossip . I enjoy reading Doris Lilly whose social-chitchat column in the Post is called " Par-ty Line " , Earl Wilson " It Hap-pened Last Night , " more Broad-way- H ollywoodish , and Leonard Lyons " The Lyons Den , " more cosmic , as well as such writers in other papers as Eugenia Sheppard Women 's Wear Daily and Suzy News . Mrs. Schiff herself , whose name may not appear in the Post without her permission , had recently been mentioned by Suzy : " At Serge Obolensky 's dinner for Cecil Beaton ... Dorothy Schiff wore black chiffon dotted with jet . " I suppose Leonard is not exactly gossip . I 'm in a tantaliz-ing position vis-a-vis gossip . People tell me things personally and then say I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw some of the Kennedy people in a restaurant in a combination that fascinated me , but I did n't feel I could relay it to Doris Lilly . Then , quite independently of me , she ran something about it . This sort of thing happens all the time . I knew Jack Kennedy quite well . I knew his father in Palm Beach when I was a girl . My family had a house there . I did n't really know Eisenhower . I met him only once . He had wonderful blue eyes . China-blue . L.B.J. I 've known for years . He 's imposing . He 's so big . He 's extremely positive . He 's the Presi-dent of the United States , and he can get very angry . He 's fascinating . When he inherited the Presidency , he asked me to come see him at the Waldorf . As I was leaving , he said to be sure to call him when I was in Washington . So I finally did , and was asked by Bill Moyers , his press secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that afternoon . I stayed an hour  --  there were just L.B. J. , Moyers , and me  --  and the President talked about everything : Vietnam , race relations , his children . There were no drinks , which I thought was peculiar at cocktail time . We talked about Vietnam dissent . He was defensive about this . The peace negotiations were mentioned , and I suggested that international negotiations might not he dissimilar to labor negotiations . ' What if the other side does n't want to negotiate ? ' he said . After I left , I thought of something I wished I 'd said ? Find a key , not a Ky . ' Esprit de l'escalier . I think L.B.J. is trying terribly hard . He 's a terrific salesman . I like Lady Bird very much . Once , at a lunch at 21 , ' in a private dining room upstairs , she told me she had been mistaken for me by a man in the elevator . I found out later that it was Max Ascoli . I do n't think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and continued , " I must be the only person who still takes the train to Washington . I hate to fly . Merle Oberon has invited me to visit her in Acapulco , but I do n't think I 'll go . I do n't like automobiles much , either , or elevators . I like trains . I once almost missed a White House dinner when the trip took six hours because of a stalled freight car near Wilmington . We had to hack up nearly all the way to New York . Luckily , I had given myself some extra time . I do n't like to fly unless I 'm with someone I have great confidence in . Someone who looks like a protector . I flew to Israel with Rudolf Sonneborn before we were married . ? r . Sonneborn , a Baltimore petroleum man who has been active in Jewish affairs , became Mrs. Schiff 's fourth husband in 1953 ; they separated in 1965 . I 'd met him at a dinner , and he said , ' Come to Israel with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zionist matters for two months , so I stayed two months  --  I did n't dare fly hack until he flew hack . Years ago , when I was in my early twenties , I met Henrietta Szold an early American Zionist leader at my Aunt Frieda 's Mrs Felix M. Warburg . I said that I 'd like to go to Palestine and work . Miss Szold asked me what I could do . I said I could sew . She discouraged me . They were looking for people with skills -- nurses and organizers . Well , when I finally went there with Rudolf I was surprised by the physical aspects of the place . I 'd heard so much about roses growing in the desert , but at that time it looked more like a desert than a garden . I saw the kibbutzim , and was tempted to become a member , austere as they were . I wo n't even fly to East Hampton . I have a married daughter with a house there , and three young children , and I visit them summer weekends and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always take the train . " Mrs. Schiff , a strikingly attractive sixty-five-year-old grandmother with a high forehead , wavy gray-white hair , blue-gray eyes , a mobile mouth , a size-10 figure , a well-modulated voice , and a rather searching expression , noted that her visitor was looking around the room . She took him on a tour of it and the rest of the upper floor , where they had been sitting . The apartment had four exposures , and was very light . The sitting room contained a fireplace ; two rows of open glass shelves filled with Staffordshire china figures ; a colored-crayon picture of a howl of flowers by Picasso ; two Grandma Moses snow scenes ; a Thomas Lawrence oil of a young woman ; and a couple of bright-colored decorative paintings signed " Carlo Canevari . " " I do n't know who he is , " their owner said . " I got them on Madison Avenue . " She led the way past a foyer that was hung with a gilt-metal chandelier embellished with china flowers , metal leaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insect motifs , into a dining room whose only picture was a John Hoppner portrait of a young man . Meissen birds perched , on eight mahogany wall brackets . " I 'm very-fond of those birds , " Mrs. Schiff said . " I kept them and the rest of the china and the portraits out of some things I inherited from my paternal grandmother . " Back in the sitting room , where she was conversationally refuelled from time to time by her interlocutor , she said , " I do n't mix as much as I 'd like to on the news side of the paper . I sometimes ask to see editorials before publication , when a particular question is involved . For instance , Cardinal Spellman 's obituary editorial was read to me over the phone before it went to press . I 'm used to editing over the phone . We used to have an editorial conference around noon , but now Jimmy Wechsler simply calls me up then and we go over everything on the phone . LVhen we make political endorsements , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I have a good deal to do with the weekend magazine features . I usually pick the books we serialize . The office sends me suggestions , and I make the choice . I spend so much time on unions and our new building . NVe bought the Hearst building on South Street , you know  --  the old Journal-ifm. - rican building . Lockwood Greene , the plant engineers , are renovating it for us . It 's costing millions of dollars . We 're putting in new presses and air-condition-big . We 'll he moved in by the summer or early fall of next year , but we 're already printing out of it , as a supplement to the press production in the building that we now occupy , in part , on West Street . I think our landlord there will he glad to see us leave  --  we 're so messy and so dirty , what with ink , grease , presses , and so on . Daintier tenants of the building include the Bank of New York 's Computer Service Division , Data Processing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 're limited in the number of copies we can print late in the day . The paper formerly had to be kept to ninety-six pages , but now we can go to a hundred and twelve . When we get the new presses , we 'll he able to go to a hundred and twenty-eight or more , and , in general , take care of all the advertising we are offered . I want to go into color for pictures , like some of the Chicago papers . No one in New York is doing that . I like it . The public will like it . Color TV has spoiled me for black-and-white . It 's like the difference between color comics and blackand-white comics . Our readers used to be mostly in Brooklyn and the Bronx , and then Queens came along , but now , although the readership has increased in these boroughs , the upper East Side of Manhattan and the downtown financial district arc our strongest areas . This is very good , for business reasons . Lie bought a horoscope feature " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives readings for the twelve s ; gns of the zodiac for every day of the week , and it is extremely popular . I do n't believe in astrology , but everyone I knew wanted it . Since we 're an afternoon paper , the horoscope 's readings  --  the advice it gives to people , keyed to their astrological periods  --  are made for the day after publication . But , of course , our first edition comes out in the morning  --  the presses run from eight-forty-five until about six , except on Sunday , when we do n't publish  --  and I get a copy here at the apartment at nine-forty-five , by messenger . Well , one day the advice to Pisces -- I 'm Pisces ; I was born on March 11 , 1903 ? said , ' Be charming all day and vou will get what you want . ' So I was charming all that day . But I had forgotten that the advice was for the nest day . By the time that day came , I was exhausted and reverted to my normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit another cigarette . " I love going to parties , but I do n't like to give them , " she said . " I 'm always afraid they 're go-ing to he disasters when I give them . Sometimes I cancel them when I have a good excuse . I live alone , and I find that I do n't mind walking into a party by myself now and then , especially when I go for professional reasons . It 's better for me to live alone ; you can concentrate better on work this way . And if you go to a party alone , you can stay or leave as you please . I enjoy looking forward to a party , but sometimes when I go I wish I 'd stood in bed . I once gave-a dinner here for Arthur Goldberg , when he was at the U.N. , and , excep-tionally , I enjoyed it . After the V.I.P.s had left , that is , and I could relax . Some of the guests stayed until two or three in the morning . I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit . I like Harry Van Arsdale president of the city 's Central Labor Council and Bert Powers Bertram A. Powers , president of the New York Local of the Inter-national Typographical Union . Bert and his wife , Patsy , have become good friends of mine  --  not , as far as he is concerned , in business , where he treats me just as roughly as the rest of the publishers , but outside . He 's interested in many things . He 's taken courses at the New School . I enjoy talking to people like IValter Reuther . Over the years , I 've seen a lot of David Dubinsky , who used to run the International Ladies ' Garment Workers ' Union . He told me that my grandfather Jacob Schiff contributed generously to it . Grandpa Schiff , although a hanker Mr. Schiff was the head of Kuhn , Loch &; Co. , was on a lot of liberal . committees . He was helpful to the I.L.G.AV.LT. because of his interest in Eastern European immigrants . Oh , the number of people from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Rose Franzhlau the Post 's human-relations columnist told me that she 's never forgotten the time he singled her out for congratulations at her graduation from one of the Hebrew schools he endowed I Mr. Schiff set up Hebrew schools in all five boroughs of the city , sent many of the teachers to college to get their doctorates , and supported them while they were learning . " Mrs. Schiff 's visitor mentioned the 1962-63 newspaper strike , which was called by the Powers union , and she said , " Four papers were struck  --  the News , World-Telegram , and Journal-American  --  and three others suspended publication in sympathy : the Herald Tribune- , Mirror , and Post . We thought the strike might last seventeen clas , as the one in 1958 did , but it went on for nearly four months . After just under three months , I got out of the Publishers ' Association and resumed publication . I wanted to do sn after the first three weeks , but I was dissuaded by several liberal advisers . I continued to fuss and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then something happened on the morning  --  February 28th when I did make the decision to pill out that made me very angry . The Publishers ' Association had formed a new subcommittee of three members , none of them from the Post . I suggested Sidney Orenstein , our labor lawyer , as a fourth . I was voted down . I felt we were frozen out , and resigned . My announcement was greeted with silence and consternation . I called Bert Powers and asked hint to meet me for lunch . I 'd moved temporarily into two small rooms at the Pierre at the time . I told Bert to meet me at the Pierre , and he said , ' Where is that ? ' When we met and I told him that I was going to resume publication , he said at first that he 'd tell time Post man not to come hack . I was flahhergasted . I argued with him , and ha gave in . Although he 's never told me , I think I know why he first said he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably been told that we 'd lose all our advertising , and he did n't want to take the responsibility for that . We got a lot of Easter advertising right away  --  we reopened on March 4th  --  but our major department-store and national advertising came back only after the other papers reopened . " Mrs. Schiff reflected for a moment , and said , " Bert told me to hold a press conference at thc : Past to announce resumption of publication , so I did . I did n't know how you hold a press conference , but he told me . I 'm terribly shy , but he gave me strength to do it . I remember in the early years of the Depression , when I was one of a group raising money for some charity , I was supposed to get up at a meeting and announce the sum I had raised , and I could n't do it . I 've improved since then . I was brought up by my- parents in the English tradition of never mentioning money . Not that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' When I was at the Brearley School , I was never given a 11 allowance , as the other girls were . My mother said to ask her for money if I needed it , but I did n't feel like doing that , because then I would have had to tell her what I wanted it for . " The Post 's publish er  --  yeli ise pa rents were the late Mortimer L. Schiff , a third-generation partner in Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. , and Adele G. Nciustadt , whose father , Sigmund , was a partner in the banking firm of Hallgarten &; Co. ? gazed at her visitor searchingly . " What does it mean when someone says that a woman thinks like a mane " she asked . " ' Ms has been said to me , of myself , two or three times . Just the other day , my daughter Sarah Ann  --  Mrs. Werner Kramarsky ; she 's the one with the place in East Hampton  --  said to me , ' So-and-So told me that everything else about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' at wanted to know what this meant . Actually , I suppose I 'm the only woman newspaper publisher around here , now that Helen Reid has retired and Alicia Patterson is dead . Of course , Kay Graham , in Washington , has an empire , what with the Washington Post and AT rwsweek and TV and radio stations . Sometimes at meetings where I 'm the only woman , I hear someone say , ' Look out ! Mrs. Schiff is here . Watch your language . ' Or there 'll be a personal remark ' That 's a good-looking suit you 're wearing ' ? which embarrasses me , because it seems u n profe ssio n . " Mrs. Schiff 's caller , who was a male , congratulated her unprofessionally on a good-looking suit she was wearing , and asked her where she got it . " Evelyn Byrnes , Fifty-eighth Street and Park Avenue , " she said . " Very expensive . I go there because it 's on the ground door . At Bergdorf 's , you have to go upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the men in m3 profession do take me seriously now , but they did n't for years . I 've heard it said that only a dame could do what I did in the Publishers ' Association and he forgiven . I suspect that if I were a male publisher more people on the paper would call me , asking for my opinion on something they planned to write . They sometimes get a hilt memo from Inc the next day the day after they have n't called , that is . Sometimes jimmy Wechsler will call and ask what I think of an idea he has , but he 's the only one . I try not to have any sacred cows . I 'm quite brave . The people who 've been on the paper a long rims think that I have a feeling for this business , and that I often turn out to be right . They think I have the common touch , and I think so , too . If I think we 've had too much about , say , Jackie Kennedy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time there when she was on page 1 three times in a row . As you rise in your profession , you scare everybody . They hesitate to call You directly . They feel they have to have an intermediary . They 're afraid to bother me ; they think I 'm too busy . Even my own children  --  I have three  --  are like that during office hours . I likr to he called . I 'd rather that people call me instead of trying to reach me through others . But I do n't expect to have any friends . I used to have lots , but they 've disappeared . Most of them were conservative , and perhaps I 've become too much of a maverick for them . I was fortunate , in a way , in my childhood . I was brought up in a big place , rather isolated . I can entertain myself . I can manage ! ' The maverick 's visitor asked her who some of the Post 's old-timers were . " Paul Sann , the executive editor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He came as a copy boy in 1931 , when lie was seventeen . Byron S. Greenberg , the business manager , has been there since 1936 . Leonard Lvons and Sylvia Porter who writes a financial column called " Your Dollar " were there when I got there  --  he came . in 1934 , and she came the next year . Jimmy Wechsler has been on the paper since 1946 . Rose Franzblau came in 1951. e acquired Drew Pearson when the Mirror folded , in 1963 . I had wanted him before . I 'Ve do n't like to kill columns for reasons other than libel , factual error , or lack of space . If we lose confidence in a columnist for any reason , we drop the column permanentItivIRS . SCHIFF 'S interlocutor asked her how she happened to come to the Post , or how the Post happened to come to her . " One night in 1939 , when I was married to George Backer , he came home and said he 'd heard that the Post was going down the drain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six years before to J. David Stern , who owned several papers , including the Philadelphia Record . I 'd married George in 1932 ; we met through Herbert Bayard Swope . George liked to write , and he was interested in politics . He introduced me to the Nation . Not that I enjo  --  ed reading it very much ; it was too heavy for me at that time . I 'd never even heard about Karl Marx until die nineteen-thirties . I knew something about ancient history but very little about modern . Oh , yes  --  the paper . George said that we ought to take over the Post from Stern . This involved paying its debts and meeting future deficits . I said that we just could n't do it . George said we had to . He said that otherwise the oldest paper in the city the Post was founded in 1801 , by Alexander Hamilton would disappear , and a thousand people would he thrown out of jobs . This moved me . I was told it would cost two hundred thousand dollars to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out not to be true . It cost millions ! My father died in 1931 , and my mother died the next year , so I had inherited some money when I was still in my twenties . Well , I acquired a majority of the Post stock on June 23 , 1939 , and later I got it all . I stayed home , and George went down to the paper as president and editor . I was a director , vice-president , and treasurer . It was all his idea . I often do things that people tell me to do . Randolph Churchill stayed in this apartment for a while in 1949 . He told me to put all the lights in this room on one switch . I said I had thought of it but that the building superintendent had said it would be too expensive . It cost fifteen dollars ! Randolph also told me that jimmy Wechsler , who was then one of our Washington correspondents , was the best one in the business . ' If I were a liberal newspaper publisher , God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Randolph said . So I brought Jimmy up here to write editorials . Randolph was very bossyMrs . Schiff smiled , and began to backtrack a hit . " After George got me interested in American politics , I became active in the 1936 Roosevelt campaign , " she said , lighting a cigarette . " I was a Republican . My father was a Republican ; my mother was completely apolitical . The others used to tease me about that . But Mrs. Roosevelt defended me once by saying that she , too , had been brought up as a Republican . I was asked by Mrs. Henry Goddard Leach  --  I 'd been with her on the hoard of the Women 's Trade Union League , an organization that helped working girls with classes in English and public speaking  --  to head up the radio committee of the women 's division of the campaign . I was still a Republican . I moved into an office in the Biltmore Hotel that summer .

I stayed with Mrs. Roosevelt 's friend Nancy Cook , who occupied part of a cottage on the place . I was something of a novelty to them . They wore ground-gripper shoes ; I wore John Frederics hats . 2 , ? 4. s.sid ... I no longer wear hats .

I have always felt that I could reach the Negro child that no one can talk to . I suppose I 'm wrong . I had a large place in Oyster Bay , and I later became involved in Democratic politics there . I ran for Nassau County delegate to the I938 Constitutional Convention . I lost to Bob Moses , but I ran a little ahead of the ticket . I know it 's a mistake for a newspaper publisher to be in politics , but in 1952 I was persuaded to run as an anti-Tammany candidate for the Democratic State Committee from the Ninth Assembly District .

He was more interested in editing than in being a publisher , and he was more interested in the editorial page and in international affairs than in local news or human-interest stories . He was a liberal , and he was uncomfortable representing management in talks with the unions . He was not fascinated by advertising or administration . He was a gentle soul , and not the hard-hitting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harbor , he stayed uptown and wrote editorials while Ted and I got the paper out , Soon after this , I asked George to let me do what I wanted with the paper . He said he did n't want to be married to a career woman , and I ca n't say I blame him for that . Our marriage broke up . He left the paper in April , 1942 , and I succeeded him as president . I 've been on the job ever since . We changed to a tabloid after he left , but the losses continued through the forties except for one year-1944 ? when we drastically cut costs . Since 1950 , except for a couple of years in the early nineteen-sixties , we 've been in the black . Some years , very much in the black . In 1967 , we made more than half a million dollars , all of which we 're plowing hack into the cost of the new presses . I do n't pay myself a salary or any dividends . " Mrs. Schiff 's interviewer had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth between fifty million and seventy-five million dollars , and he asked its publisher about this . " You never know what a newspaper is worth until you try to sell it , " she said . " When Sam Newhouse bought the Cleveland Plain Dealer , be reportedly , paid fifty million dollars for it . Its daily circulation was less than two-thirds of what ours is now , so perhaps we are worth something like a hundred million . It 's always been a great surprise to me when we make money . I like to make money . If a newspaper is n't self-supporting , it 's like being a kept woman . It 's good for office morale to make money  --  it gives the people who work for you a sense of security . They know the owner is n't likely to sell out or fold up . If you begin to lose money , you lose such an awful lot . But when you begin to make it , you can make a lot . My brother John Mortimer Schiff , who succeeded his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently said to me , ' I 'm very proud of you . ' He 'd never said such a thing to me before , The Post is n't especially different from what it 's been for years . He said that Wall Street had expected it to fail and was enormously impressed because we seemed to have succeeded . " In the summer of 1943 , Mrs. Backer , as she was then , became Mrs. Thackrey . Her new husband , who had started his career with the Kansas City Star , had been upped from executive editor to editor and assistant publisher of the Post , which he had joined as assistant city editor in 1936 . He remained at the helm through 1948 , but in the summer of that year he and his wife had a serious journalistic disagreement . " Ted had not been interested in politics , but he got involved in the Henry Wallace campaign , " she said . " At that time , I did n't favor Truman , but I was even more opposed to Wallace . Ted wrote half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen in rebuttal . In the end , I came out for Dewey . In those politically excitable times , the Post 's publisher announced this choice a week before Election Day . Ted was against the Marshall Plan , which I was for . We separated , professionally and personally , at the beginning of 1949 . I let him take over the paper , but this arrangement was short-lived . My lawyers at that time  --  Greenbaum , Wolff &; Ernst  --  worked nut an agreement that did n't work out . Ted left in April , and I 've been in full charge of the paper ever since . We were divorced that summer . He 'd gone off to start the Daily Compass . I 'd been Mrs. Hall , Mrs. Backer , and Mrs. Thackrey , and after Ted became publisher of the Compass  --  it had rather a short life  --  I thought it might be confusing to have two newspaper publishers named Thackrey in New York , so I resumed my maiden name . I asked my brother whether I should call myself Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had better he Mrs. ' " The latter-day Mrs. Schiff , who retained this name when she married 11,1r . Sonneborn , lit another cigarette and launched into another chronological digression . " I admired President Roosevelt , and I guess he liked me , " she said . " He started inviting me to Hyde Park in the nineteen-thirties . Then he urged me to buy half of a fiftyfour-acre farm he owned around there and build a house on it . I did n't do anything about it , but one day I got a hill for nine thousand dollars for the property . I asked Sam Rosenman 's advice  --  justice Samuel I. Rosenman ; he 'd married Ted and me , and he was counsel to F.D.R. both as governor and as President  --  and he said , When the President of the United States wants to sell you a farm , you should buy it . ' I built the cheapest house I could on it . It was a cute little red house . I still had my big place in Oyster Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first year I had the farm I loaned it to Sam Rosenman , and the second year I let Jim Forrestal have it . Later on , I used it myself for a couple of summers . The President would take me driving in a special manually operated car that Henry Ford had built for him . He 'd say , ' How 's the pape ? ' The paper . Nancy Cook cautioned me not to mention the war or politics to him . He was supposed to relax when he was at Hyde Park . He did n't like anything sad . On our drives , he 'd tell anecdotes about how he ran away from his governess as a child , and how he was now ducking the Secret Service . He loved crossing a certain highway , where the traffic would he stopped for him . He said this had never happened when he was governor not until he was Presi-dent . He liked to tease his wife . I remember once , when we were having Iiinch at Granny 's  --  his mother 's  --  house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the 1939 World 's Fair . ' What are you going to say about me ? ' he asked . " Ladies and gentlemen , the President of the United States , " ' she said . ' What else can I say ? ' ' Darling , are n't you going to say one kind word about me ? ' he said , with a piteous expression . I was at Hyde Park on Election Night in 1936 and 1940 . The last time I saw the President was Labor Day weekend of 1944 . He looked terrible , and was eating soft cereal . After Miss Le Hand retired , I wanted to work for him , but he said no . He was very suspicious of city people . He wanted me to go into the Department of Agriculture . Despite my farm , I did n't think this was my dish of tea . I sold the farm after his death . " Mrs. Schiff paused , and then said , " The President 's mother approved of me . Whenever we met , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aunt Mrs. ? Varburg ? ' She meant Mrs. Herbert Lehman and Mrs. Paul M. Warburg . Well , Mrs. Warburg was my Great-Aunt Nina , and I gave up explaining that Mrs. Lehman was n't my aunt at all . " ON the theory that the rich deserve the best , Mrs. Schiff 's biographer invited her for their next session to La Grenouille Restaurant , where , arriving a minute or two after him , she was greeted by the management with affectionate cries of " Mme. Scheel ! " " I feel that Oyster Bay is the grave-yard of my childhood , " she said , upon being urged to carry on in Memory Lane . " My brother John still has the grounds there , or most of them . I hardly ever go out to visit , but I have a strange feeling when I do . The trees are still there . I was always a hookworm , and my mother was a fresh-air fiend , so I 'd get under a tree and read . I used to read by rote . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things off . I did a hit of things by rote . I 'd rush through museums in Europe . My family took us abroad  --  John and me  --  nearly every year . We were on the Olympic when the Titanic went down , and at Aix-lesBains when the First World War broke out . I remember everyone singing ' Nearer My God to Thee ' on the Olympic . As children , in the country , we had every kind of athletic lesson tennis , golf , riding , swimming but I never liked sports . I do n't like the country . I think it 's lonely . I sold my mother 's Palm Beach house , which she left to me , almost at once after she died . I sold my share of Oyster Bay a hundred and thirty-five acres , out of eight hundred and sixty-five acres owned by her fatherj to Mme. Jacques Baisan when she came hack here after the fall of France . I sponge on Sarah Ann in East Hampton . My mind is completely on presses and on candidates for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like it to be a combination of a tabloid and a literary magazine . Perhaps that 's what it is . " Mrs. Schiff took a sip of a Bloody Mary and said , " I was born in my father 's house at 932 Fifth Avenue , which his father , who had been living there , had given him when he married . My father later bought several of the neighboring houses anti lots to protect himself and to house his collections of French eighteenth-century illustrated books , majolica , furniture , rugs , and so on . He loved inlaid tables . I was educated at home until I was ten . Endless teachers came in  --  for piano , carpentry , French , German , and whatnot  --  some of whom I shared with my five Warburg first cousins . M3 mother was afraid I 'd he contaminated by germs if I went to school or stores . After reading about leprosy , I was afraid I was going to have it . I was also terrified of the ragamuffins who came to the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasy that I was adopted . I was a year and a half older than John , but there was so much stress on the male . The dynasty feeling was very strong . My father wanted the family name to carry on . His father , the renowned banker and philanthropist , had conic to this country in 1865 from Frankfurt-am-Main , where the Schiff family tree , heavy with rabbinical , scientific , and mercantile luminaries , has been documented back to 1370.1 I was surprised to learn , after I grew lip , that my parents had been just as fond of me as they were of John . We were given Bible lessons at home by a Miss Clemens , whom the Felix Warhurgs also had for their chit dren . I remember the lovely Gustave Dore pictures of God emerging from beams of light not a hit like the rather punishing , jealous Old Testament God we learned about from Miss Clemens , I always felt He was frowning at me when I did something wrong . I was always doing something wrong , and getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious . When my brother and I were small , he came to the house and blessed us every Friday night . ' May the Lord 's countenance shine upon you , ' he would say . I did n't know what ' countenance ' meant . I did n't dare ask . Grandpa gave me a copy of the Old Testament , but later on I read the New Testament on my own . I never dared tell hum this . I was ambitious as a child . I wanted to he like the people whose statues were in Central Park . I spent so much of my youth there . Our nurses and governesses took us there even on the coldest days . My cheeks froze . They had to he rubbed with ice when we got home . I got to hate the Park . I resolved never to go there again after I grew up , but a few years after making this resolution I was back there  --  once a week , with my babies , on the nurse 's day off . " Mrs. Schiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four acquaintances in the restaurant . " I finally got to the Brcarley School , " she said as lunch was served . " There , I felt that my white stockings and white button shoes with patent-leather bottoms stood out , not in a good way . The other girls had black ribbed-cotton stockings and brown oxfords . My mother bought all my clothes , and hers , in Paris Most of my classmates lived in brownstones on the upper East Side . Their food was different from ours  --  it seemed better to me . They had hot cocoa with whipped cream for lunch . We only had water . We had thirteen servants , including a butler and two footmen . I remember feeling it was odd that our caretaker and his wife moved to the country  --  Oyster Bay  --  in winter and to the city in summer . I never travelled in a public vehicle , including taxis , until I was married . Not counting ocean liners , that is . On trains in this country , we had a private car , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could send telegrams free , because he was also a director of Western Union . The Brearley was at Sixty-first Street and Park Avenue in those days , and I went there  --  sixteen blocks  --  and hack on foot . If the weather was had , I made the trip in my mother 's car . She had a Renault , and my father had a Rolls-Royce . Carl Van Doren was headmaster during my last two or three years at the Brearley . He taught us English . I ran into him many-years later at a cocktail party , and he said that I had dark hair and red cheeks , and just sat there looking sullen , as though I were daring him to teach me anything . I went to Bryn Mawr when I was seventeen , but I stayed only a year . My mother disapproved of my going to college . She said I 'd become a bluestocking . She said that I could go fur a year , and that then I 'd have to come out . Dr. Grenfell Sir Wilfred T. Grenfell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mawr when I was there , and I wanted to work for him in the summer , but Mother would n't let me . Grandpa Schiff died in the fall of 1920 , right after I entered college . When I came hack from the funeral , Carey Thomas , the dean of Bryn Mawr , asked me if the Schiff who had just died was my father . I was so rattled that I said yes . My grandfather was very strict . He had a house on Fifth Avenue a few blocks north of ours . One day when I was fifteen or sixteen , I called on him . He asked me what I had on my face . I said powder . He asked inc to show him the box . I handed him a Dorine cardboard box with a powder puff . He threw it out the window . I stamped my foot . ' At least give me the fifty cents it cost , ' I said . I do n't believe he did . My father had two racing stables , one here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father would find this out , but Grandpa never read the sports pages of the papers . " I had my coming-out party at home when I was eighteen , " Mrs. Schiff continued , between bites . " Lewis Strauss Rear Admiral Lewis L. Strauss , an eventual Kuhn , Loeb partner who had been brought to the firm by Mortimer Schiff as a young associate in 1919 remembers it vividly . He was appalled by it , be-cause there were no Jews at it . Virtually . I was n't particularly aware of this at the time . I 'd in-vited the girls I 'd gone to school with and spent summer vacations on Long Island with . We were all in the Social Register . I was surprised to read in Our Crowd ' that my brother John went sailing into the Social Register ' when he married Edith Baker in 1934 . The Mortimer Schiffs first treated themselves to a Register listing in 1904 . After I came out , I wanted to get a job . I went to the Ballard secretarial school at the Y.W.C.A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses from Scranton , Pennsylvania , in everything from accounting to psychology . I asked my father for a job at Kuhn , Loeb , but Ile would n't take inc . " Over coffee , Kuhn , Lneh 's rejecter said , " I met Dick Hall at a party , and we became engaged two years later . He was six years older than I , and a First World War veteran . My parents objected to the possibility of our marriage and took me abroad . To forget . This did n't work . They even brought a Rothschild over here for me , but it was too late . Anyway , he came over here with his mistress  --  he was a French Rothschild and there was some trouble about this with the immigration authorities . My father had to get him out of the country rather fast . Dick and I were married in Oyster Bay by Bishop Herbert Shipman , whom I knew very well . I was twenty . I do n't know what would have happened if Grandpa Schiff had still been alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon after we were married . vVe were dependent on my parents financially . The maid passed a rather noncommittal-looking dish , and Mother said , ' What is that ? ' I said steak , or chicken , or whatever . No , thank you , ' she said . I never dared invite her for dinner again . I did n't have anyone else for quite a while . Do you suppose that 's the reason I 'm such a nervous hostess ? " Paul , the Grenouille maitre d'h  --  tel , came to the table and said that there was a call for Mme. Scheel . She took it on an exposed telephone in another section of the restaurant , and , on her return , said that it was the Post operator , telling her that there had been a White House call from Walt Rostow ( Special Assistant to President Johnson for national-security affairs ) , and that she had told the operator she would go home and call him hack . She invited her lunchmate to accompany her to the apartment . They drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant ; the driver , one of a Negro couple she employs , also acts as her butler . On the way , she remarked that William Cullen Bryant had been the Post 's editor from 1829 until his death in 1878 , that he had been succeeded by Parke Godwin , and that in 1881 Henry Villard had bought it and Carl Schurz had become its editor , followed by Edwin Godkin . " It was founded as the Evening Post by Alexander Hamilton , but J. David Stern dropped the ' Evening , ' " she said . Her companion asked her whether she was influenced by the paper 's past , and she replied , " You do n't want to kill the oldest newspaper in the city . " Back at the apartment , Mrs. Schiff put in a call to Mr , Rostow , whose line was busy , and took her visitor on a tour of the lower floor . The general effect , again , was one of lightness --  fir:we : - pieces en the walls of a study and a guest room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballet girl and a big needlepoint rug with squares of bright flowers . " It took me five years to make that rug , " she said . " I 've just finished one For Sarah Ann 's house in the country . Now all three of my children have rugs that I 've made . I do needlepoint when I have television on . I read the Time 's thoroughly first thing in the morning here  --  I drive down to the office around eleven  --  and I also follow the news on TV . I like TV movies and panel discussions . I do n't swim or play golf , so I do needlepoint . It 's occupational therapy . If I could paint or play the piano , I would n't be doing a handicraft . " The telephone rang ; it was Mr. Rostow . " The President likes something we wrote about Vietnam , " Mrs. Schiff said after hanging up . " Is n't that amazing ? People ask me why I have n't been to Vietnam , but you have to fly there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read some of her columns and to sec her office , and she accommodatingly invited him to lunch there the following week . The Post building , at 75 West Street , near the lower end of Manhattan , proved to he remarkably dingy and down-at-heel , but the publisher 's room , on the lower floor of a duplex penthouse  --  gained , after the regular elevator to the fifteenth landing , by a tiny lift  --  was impressive : a large panelled-oak Jacobean chamber with eight big windows , four of which directly overlooked the Hudson . The furniture was comfortable  --  chairs and a sofa with flower-print slipcovers . The walls were hung with portraits of George Washington and Jacob Schiff , a large color photograph of a portrait of Franklin Roosevelt by Frank 0 . Salisbury , a scroll attesting to Mrs. SchifF 's membership in the French Legion of Honor , and a couple of letters signed by Horace Greeley , the founder of the New York Tribune , and Charles A.

" The room was here when I came , " Mrs. Schiff said . " I think that the Cyrus Curtises stayed here occasionally after he bought the Post , and that this was their living room . There 's a large bathroom next to it . The floor above this had a dining room , kitchen , and maid 's room , which I converted into offices . Dave Stern used to give cocktail parties here for advertisers . I started on the third floor of the building , where our accounting department is now , and then moved up here . I was afraid it would be ivory-tower . It is ivory-tower . The walls were originally dark , but I had them pickled to beige . I got that big partners ' desk in London during the Depression for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I did n't have to pay any duty on it . I had it restored a year ago , and the man who did the job said it was worth a lot . He wanted to buy it . As you can sec , it accommodates two people . You can sit on either side of it , with drawers facing you . " The partnerless owner of the partners ' desk handed her caller Xeroxes of some of her columns written in the nineteen-fifties , and said that he could keep them . " The greatest fun is writing your own column , but it took too much of my time , " Mrs , Schiff said . " It seems to me / spend most of my time dealing with money matters , and I loathe that . In the column , I dared say things that other people would n't say . Once , at the end of an interview with Einstein , I quoted him as saying , We had great hopes for Israel at fact . We thought it might he better than other nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a lot of angry letters . The late A. J.

" Mrs. Schiff 's visitor studied her columns after he got home . The earl ) ones were headed " Publisher 's Letter " and started out , " Dear Reader ; " later on they were headed " Dear Reader " and simply started out . The latter-day Reader had heard that the columnist Mari so often obtained her material at public dinners , which she generally graced at the dais table , that she be ? came known in the office as the ban-quet editor , but the examples given him bore this out only fractionally . They struck him as chatty , descriptive , well written , and occasionally hardheaded . The one on Einstein contained a passage that read : Saintlike , simple , gentle Professor Einstein was sitting in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of him was a table laden with marked books and sheets of white paper covered with tiny , near symbols . Re wore a faded blue sweater over his tieless blue shirt , gray trousers , and brown mouton slippers on his bare feet . An old-fashioned steamer rug had slipped off one knee and an electric heater was beside him . The temperature of the room was comfortable . Two walls were lined with shelves filled with hooks and folders . Another ran , in part : Government by the " best " men is an aristocratic , not an American , concept . The American people refuse to he ruled by their better element or minority . ? Why are n't more reformers elected ? Because they are inexperienced in a field where shrewdness and tact are among the necessary qualifications . The " bosses " are popular . They know and sympathize with the people .

The really successful can not take time out for politics ? But is n't the reformer usually right in principle ? Yes , but politics does n't consist in beirg right . It 's in making other people think you are .... Super-refinement puts a man out of sympathy with much that is basic in humanity , A logical argumeet is all right in a court of appeals , but can not sway votes . Mrs. Schiff produced drinks from a small , well-stocked bar and sat down near the fireplace . A secretary came in with a political advertisement for her approval , but before she could finish reading it the telephone rang . " Hello , John , " she said , and , after gossiping about a party held the previous evening , which her brother and his wife had also attended , she launched into a discussion of the financing of her new building . " I 've asked John for a plan on how to pay for it and its improvements , " she sa 'd after finishing her talk with him . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanks . How long the loan should he for . Kuhn , Loch takes care of our investments , but they do n't finance this sort of thing . They 're not that kind of hank , but my brother 's advice is helpful . There are a whole lot of things that I hate talking about and do n't try to understand , like depreciation " ? sh laughed ? " and stuff . We 'll sublet some space in the new building . Presses are terribly expensive . Most of the Journal-A meri.ean ones were built at least thirty-five years ago . We ca n't do the financing out of income . The whole business is costing ten million dollars or more . " She read the rest of the advertising copy , and her visitor asked whether this kind of chore was routine . " Anything that 's a bit out of the ordinary is shown to me , " she said . " Especially political and ' cause ' ads . I want to he sure that the information in the ad is n't misleading . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get Julian Leeds , the Post 's advertising manager . " Julie ! " she said , and a conversation about the advertisement ensued . Mrs. Schiff hung up , and then called the city desk . " Get me Patti Sann , or , if lie 's out , Stan Opotowsky the managing editor , " she said . After checking the facts in the ad with Mr. Opotowsky , she informed her visitor that it was 0 . K. Hardly had she taken a sip of her drink  --  a tomato-juice-and-vodka on the rocks  --  when the telephone rang . " Jimmy , hello ! " she said . A ten-minute chat with Mr. Wechsler developed , mostly about the possibility of Mayor Lindsay 's being appointed by Rockefeller to fill the senatorial vacancy caused by the death of Robert Kennedy . Mrs. Schiff felt that such speculation was unrealistic , and wondered why the Times had run a story on it on page 1 . She said that the story might have been stimulated by Lindsay people . " It is n't credible that a Republican governor would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayoralty over to the Democrats , " she said . " It 's ludicrous . " Mr. Wechsler disagreed . He thought that Rockefeller might offer the appointment , and that Lindsay would turn it down . He suggested running an editorial advising such action , but Mrs. Schiff turned this down . Lunch followed , on the card table  --  a corned-beef sandwich and coleslaw for the guest , an egg-salad sandwich for his hostess . " I generally lunch here , " she said as she poured coffee . " There are n't any good restaurants down here .... People ask me whether I enjoy having power . I never think of whether I have power or not . I think power is a male concept . I hope I have influence . I like to persuade . When I started out here , I did things , or tried to do them , with a sledgehammer .

" As the two left the table , Mrs. Schiff said , " I love clothes , and I sometimes think I 'd like to have lots of social engagements , but I do n't really have time . In this business , you have to work terribly hard to stay where you are , and superhumanly hard if you want to move ahead . " It was now two-thirty , and a call from her secretary reminded her that she had scheduled a circulation meeting for this rime . On his way out , her visitor paused before the Jacob Schiff portrait , which was signed by Harrington Mann . The banker was sitting in an armchair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thoughtful , and benevolent . His granddaughter said that the picture was a copy , and that the original was in the lobby of Kuhn , Loeb &; Co . " We went to Grandpa Schiff 's house for dinner Friday evenings when I was in my teens , " she said . " Lots of family , mostly War-burgs . After dinner , the men and women were segregated . The women went to the drawing room and talked about clothes , food , babies ' diets , and housekeeping . The men went to the smoking room , where I was always sure they were talking about world-shaking matters . I was dying to get in that room . Well , I 'm in it now . "
