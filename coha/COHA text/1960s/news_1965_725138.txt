txt Saigon The major topic of conversation among young men in Saigon these days is the draft . South Vietnamese armed forces have been taking men in at an average rate of 11,000 per month during the past half year . Many of the new soldiers are city bred . " I 'll have to go some time , anyway , " one young pedicab driver waiting for a customer said to another . " They say you can make 3,000 piasters a month . I 'm single  --  why not join ? " " I do n't believe it , " the other said . " Well , you 'll see , " the first replied . Not all prospective draftees are as willing as this youth , but the conversation reflects the steady improvement in South Vietnamese treatment of soldiers during the past year . Improved morale Three thousand piasters is about $25 at the bank rate . An across-the-board pay raise last summer added two billion piasters to Saigon 's swollen budget . But it seems to have paid dividends in better Army morale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if the recruitment rate is encouraging , the desertion rate also has taken an upward curve during the past year . In 1964 there were a total of 72,000 deserters from all types of South Vietnamese armed forces . This year , so far , there have been 87,000 . Partly this is because of the new conscripts the armed forces have been taking . The South Vietnamese Army is a career for most men . Only 12 percent of enlisted men are conscripts . But the new recruits are mostly city dwellers . Many were previously deferred or dodged the draft . Some of these desert , or rather go absent without leave soon after they finish their basic training . Many come back later , so that the 87,000 figure does not mean a permanent loss to the armed forces . The desertion rate , while worrisome , is not considered to reflect an over-all drop in Army morale . It has , of course , kept the Army build-up from being as rapid as originally planned . Regional forces Today , the total of men under arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 671,000 . This compares with 600,000 at the end of 1964 and to 520,000 at the beginning of 1964 . Of these , the regular armed forces  --  Army , Navy , Air Force  --  have 296,000 men , compared with 243,000 at the end of 1964 and 207,000 at the beginning of that year . Regional forces  --  similar to the National Guard in the United States , have 121,000 men , compared with 80,000 two years ago . The popular forces  --  recruited in the villages and used primarily for village defense ? have 137,000 men compared with 90,000 two years ago . It is the popular forces that have borne the brunt of the fighting , ever since the Communist insurgency began . The black cotton-garbed militia , often without shoes until a couple of years ago , manned most of the tiny triangular outposts that protect villages and bridges . During 1964 , their numbers swelled to 170,000 , then dropped to the present 137,000 figure . They are the poorest paid of Vietnamese soldiers .
