Charles Harting Percy , 43 , endlessly energetic board chairman of Chicago 's camera-making Bell &; Howell Co. , recently confronted a group of ten Illinois Republican county chairmen . Sounding them out about his aspirations to run next year for Governor , he invited questions . The pros were curious about the little ( 5 ft. 8 in. ) fellow with the vast sense of confidence . " Well , Chuck , " asked Putnam County 's Jefford Jepson Jr. , " what do you know about Putnam County ? " With an **35;693;TOOLONG smile , Percy riffled through a black looseleaf notebook . " Well , Jeff , " he replied , " in 1960 , when Governor Stratton was losing Putnam County 1,400 to 1,192 votes , you carried it for Senator Dirksen . Your land area is 166 square miles , and you have a population of 4,578 , or 28 people per square mile . <P> Your population loss between 1950 and 1960 was 3.7% , and .3% of your population is nonwhite . The median age of your people is 34.5 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 40 marriages in your county last year . The median income in Putnam County is $5,077 per year , and 25.7% of your wage earners make less than $3,000 per year . Thirty-five percent of them work outside the county . There are 1,710 dwellings , most of them owned by the residents . " Then he delivered a little sermon about how " government can create the proper climate , but the work of solving those problems has to be done largely by the communities . So , Jeff , with your practical experiences in Putnam County , your job is to help interpret to me what role the state can play to stimulate life in Putnam County . " The chairmen were impressed-and Percy was encouraged . Last week , after years as an enthusiastic political amateur , he finally took the big plunge , announced that he is a candidate for Governor . <P> " Call Me Chuck . " Percy 's decision was hardly surprising , for he has a reputation for grappling with challenging opportunities . The son of a Bell &; Howell office manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of five . He probably would have started earlier , but his parents would not let him cross the street . At the University of Chicago , he grossed $150,000 a year selling furniture , linen , food and coal to fraternities ; he clerked at Bell &; Howell during his summers , so impressed B. &; H. President Joseph McNabb that he became the boss 's protege . He was made a board member at 23 , and at 29 was elected president of the company . The newspapers inevitably dubbed him " Wonder Boy . " Percy cringed at the title . " Please , " he pleads , " call me Chuck . " <P> Percy decided to run for political office only after he became convinced that Bell &; Howell could now get along without him . Since he took over the company in 1949 , he points out , " annual revenue has risen from $13 million to $160 million . So I have given a lot of thought lately to what my future will be .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
