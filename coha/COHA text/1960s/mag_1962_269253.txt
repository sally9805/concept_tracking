STATE OF BUSINESS <P> " Negative psychology seems to characterize the general mood , " reported New York 's Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. in its latest monthly survey of business conditions , " and a peaking-out of business before the year 's end is now being discussed as a distinct possibility ' ' ( " peaking out " is a positive-psychology way of saying " recession " ) . <P> A growing list of unsettling economic indicators contributed to the negative thinking . Retail sales , off 1% in May , dropped another 2% in June-partly because of an unexpected fall in auto sales . Building permits for new housing , which rose last winter to foretell this spring 's burst of construction activity , are now trailing off . Railroad carloadings-often considered a key index of business activity-ran below last year 's levels for most of June , and railroadmen look for July 's seasonal decline to be worse than usual . <P> Manufacturers ' new orders , which foreshadow how busy the nation 's factories will be , rose .5% from April to May , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hard goods fell for the fourth straight month . <P> These bothersome figures put more pressure on the Administration for quick across-the-board tax cuts . The Administration still had not committed itself on that . But last week Washington did respond with two milder stimulants:1 ) a long-awaited speedup in depreciation write-offs of industrial plant and equipment ; 2 ) lowering the cash margin required in buying stocks from 70% to 50% . <P> Neither move was done solely to improve current business conditions : depreciation revision has been in the works for more than two years , and the cut in stock margins was a natural response by the Federal Reserve Board to the decline in stock prices and to the conviction that inflation is no longer a danger . Neither action is likely to provide much immediate stimulus to business activity , but the long-run impact of both moves should be good , and in the short run they should help shore up public confidence .
