Jensen , head of the University of Illinois ' journalism division , speaking on " Freedom of the Press " as the 1962 Nieman Chair lecturer at Milwaukee 's Marquette University : <P> " What is most urgently required for the rehabilitation of the concept of freedom of the press is a new metaphysics-a metaphysics that will restore what Positivism , Romanticism , Collectivism , and other derivative isms have lately destroyed : an image of the Self as ontologically independent of Culture and existentially related to an objective order of values .
