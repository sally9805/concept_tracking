New Hampshire villages hold their traditional town meetings this week , and to save the voters an extra trip into town the state runs off its presidential primaries at the same time . Among the local issues to be decided by the state 's honest farmers  --  and , in increasingly large numbers , by its honest horse trainers , motel owners and souvenir-stand operators  --  is where tickets are to be sold in New Hampshire 's new sweepstakes . It may be worth noting that none of the declared or undeclared presidential aspirants has had a word to say about the controversial lottery , which was signed into law last April . This may be tact. , New Hampshire residents are not fond of being re  --  minded that their state has become the Monaco of New England , although they admire the Yankeeefficiency of an arrangement whereby horseplayers from Boston pay much of the cost of running the New Hampshire statehouse . On the other hand , this silence on the part of the men  --  and the woman  --  who want to be President may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to the front-runners at least  --  a thoroughly distressing sweepstakes of their own . Early last fall the New Hampshire primary shaped up as a duel between New York 's Gov . Nelson Rockefeller and Arizona 's Sen. Barry Goldwater . But because New Hampshire is the first state in the nation to hold a primary , it attracts a great many people with dreams of glory , and virtually every  --  body who has been mentioned for the top G.O.P. spot is represented in one way or another . New Hampshire is a particularly good place to start this year , since it is a traditionally Republican state and it is the Republicans who must decide on a candidate . the Democratic nomination already be  --  ing pretty much spoken for . Normally a state which is dominated by one party has the kind of strong organization which discourages dissent , but the party structure in New Hampshire is weak and scattered and there has been no strong G.O.P. leader since the death of former Sen. Styles Bridges . To make conditions even more ideal for a steeple  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together the signatures of 100 registered party members to get himself listed on the ballot . The ballot , which is so complicated that it may take several days to tabulate all the votes , consists of two he said wistfully , " we hare thought of it . " Nixon 's noncampaign has no delegates , no pretty girls and no headquarters , and may not need them to embarrass the field . Powell , who needs a winner badly , said bluntly , " Look . you know Gold  --  water is n't doing well . Neither is Rocke  --  feller . If this were an ordinary election , it would n't make much difference . A write-inwould n't have it chance , because most of the people would just stay home . But they 're not going to stay home this time . They 're going to go to the town meeting to vote on the tim 1 officers and the sweepstakes , and if they do n't like Rockefeller or Goldwater , they 're going to vote for someone else . " That says it for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor Blood , a Concord surgeon who has at  --  tended five national conventions . hopes to be sent to his sixth as head of a slate of uncommitted delegates . Doctor Blood tiled early in the campaign . taking no trouble to hide his dissatisfaction with both Rockefeller and Goldwater . The Lodge and Nixon movements were not et afloat , and the feeling is widespread that Blood jumped too soon ; no Lincoln-mined delegate has been elected in years , and his delegates just might wind up in somebody else 's pocket . If Doctor Blood has outguessed him  --  self , he may have company . With more than half a dozen candidates and non-candidates in the field , there is a tendency to overlook the fact that front-runners sometimes stay out in front . How do the announced candidates look ? Sen. Smith is willing Norman Lepage looks 40 , round-faced and jolly . Counting the present campaign , he has run for office 10 times , winning once in an unopposed election for the office of Nashua selectman . He wants to debate the other candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is willing if all the rest are . As an accountant , he favors a balanced budget . He says we should land a large force of diplomats in Cuba . He has re  --  ceived one campaign contribution , of S10 . Harold Stassen is governor-shaped  --  tall and heavy  --  and has a governor 's healthy tea-rose color , although he has not been elected to any office since his third term as governor of Minnesota ex  --  pired in 1945 . He knots his tie faultlessly , speaks clearly and in well-organized sen  --  tences , and lives his life amid a constant but barely audible hum which consists of the single muttered sentence , " What is wrong with Stassen ? " The answer to the question may lie in an incident which took place at the out  --  set of his campaign . Stassen was in Laconia about to make the first speech of what will presumably be his last try at a political comeback . The television cameras that he needed so desperately were set up , the Chamber of Commerce was fed and attentive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to de  --  scribe the " Eisenhower middle way , " and the jetport he would build in New Hampshire if elected . Then a fuse blew and the room went black . The beautifully * trained voice went on without a miss , and probably would have done so if the room * had slowly filled with water . But it was clear what is wrong with Harold Stassen ; he is a man for whom the lights go out . Midway through thecampaign a middle-aged Ford containing a gray-haired at- tractive woman of 66 began meanderingabout the state . Margaret Chase Smith would be up at six each morning , drawing what crowds there were to draw in , say , Ellsworth , NIL which has a population of 12 . If a farmer or a logger stirred out  --  side , Senator Smith would stop , greet him with , " Good morning , I 'm Margaret Smith , " and then , if the man wanted to talk , exchange a few words about farm  --  ing , logging or the weather . In town she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular effort to pick one that was lull or voters , and chat pleasantly with clerk or owner . At Plymouth State College she talked briefly on the Bay of Pigs ( she would have provided air cover ) , the test-ban treaty ( she is against it ) , Southeast Asia ( " I am confused . I think we should go in all the way and clean it up or get out " ) , and the names Khru  --  shchev has called her ( " Cannibalistic little woman , Amazon warmonger " ) . In one hard day of such campaigning she saw no more than 100 to 150 voters . But Maggie Smith has been winning elections in Maine this way for a long time and up to now has never lost one . She says she wants the nomination and expects to get it . New Hampshire political  --  cians refuse to take her seriously , which suggests that they have not consulted Maine politicians . She will not win the primary , of course , but her vote could be surprisingly large if enough women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce . If she does well , Senator Smith will have proved that women must be considered more seri  --  ously for high office , and this is the mo  --  tive that most observers suggest for her barnstorming . But politicians are subtle far less often than is generally supposed . What makes Maggie run may be no more than the realization that a loss can not hurt her . while a good showing will greatly increase her leverage in Washing  --  ton and in Maine  --  where Republican victories are no longer automatic , even for Margaret Chase Smith . When Barry Goldwater was invited to open his campaign with a nonpolitical speech at a New England College dinner early last fall , he did a terrible thing . He made a nonpolitical speech . What was almost as bad , from his standpoint , he let Mrs. Styles Bridges , who has political ambitions of her own , dominate the evening by using the occasion to donate a chair in government to the college in the name of her late husband . Goldwater backers , who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ran as high as four to one , left the dinner in dismay . After that nothing went right . A recent operation for a bone spur on his heel forced him to make his first two trips to the state on crutches . This might have won him sympathy , but Goldwater is a man who violates all political rules by acting and saying exactly what he feels at the moment . It is part of his considerable charm , when he is being charming . But on the second trip , particularly , his mood was sour  --  at times SO sour that he re  --  fused to shake hands . A reporter who picked up Goldwater midway through the campaign found his aides busy making long , exasperated apologies for his performance . It was a surprise , therefore , to find things going well at a Goldwater dinner at upstate Littleton ( population 3,355 ) . He signed autographs and shook hands in a quiet , friendly way  --  a tall , tanned man who looked thinner and less rugged than his photographs . He spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
