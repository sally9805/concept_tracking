It was 6 p.m. , and Moscow 's Pushkin Square was thronged with workers heading homeward for their evening borsch . Suddenly two pacifists , an American girl and an Englishman , appeared and began handing out leaflets in Russian urging the startled recipients to take " any peaceful action in your power " to bring about the withdrawal of Soviet and other Warsaw Pact troops from Czechoslovakia . <P> <P> " Why are you doing this ? " asked a woman in the fast-swelling crowd . Speaking in hesitant Russian , 24-year-old New Yorker Vicky Rovere answered : " Because of my conscience . " It was not a satisfactory answer . Another woman shouted " Provocateur ! " and a third tried to lead Vicky away . Most of the leaflets were torn up . Within five minutes the police arrived , and Vicky tossed her remaining leaflets high in the air . Immediately , she was punched hard in the stomach by an elderly man . " That , " she said , " was not very nice of you . " Across the square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T shirt proclaiming END NATO , END THE U.S. <P> <P> WAR IN VIETNAM AND END THE OCCUPATION OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA , Was passing out handbills . He , too , was collared by police and the two protesters were taken off for interrogation . <P> That was the end of the first Mos cow demonstration by a small organization called War Resisters ' International , founded in The Netherlands after World War I and now headquartered in London . W.R.I. , which claims branches in 40 nations , supports nonviolence and works closely with the Quakers . A major point in its program is " to seek and maintain contact with war resisters in countries where it is dangerous to oppose government policy . " <P> At the same time as the Moscow demonstration was going on , W.R.I , teams in Warsaw , Sofia and Budapest went into action . All the protesters were arrested as they handed out their leaflets . In Moscow , Miss Rovere and Papworth were questioned for more than five hours , then deported unceremoniously to London next morning . Poland expelled its five Danes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hasty . At week 's end , however , the Bulgarian government released the four Italian youths who had demonstrated in Sofia , and Hungary freed its five protesters , including Robert Eaton , 24 , of Philadelphia . Were the demonstrations useful ? Miss Rovere , safely back in London , summed it up this way : " I wish that I had had a real chance to talk to people , but I think we accomplished something worthwhile . "
