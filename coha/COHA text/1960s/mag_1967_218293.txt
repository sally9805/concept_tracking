Revolutionary teachers and students smeared paste all over my body and stuck on pieces of paper with abusive slogans . They forced me to wear a black dunce cap and beat me with their belt buckles. 1 spent 103 days in a dreadful hideout for devils and demons and underwent what is too painful to describe . <P> So last week did one of Red China 's foremost musicians describe the treatment meted out to him by Mao Tse-tung 's Red Guards . What made the description more remarkable was that it was made on American soil , in Manhattan , by one of the few escapees from Red China to reach the U.S. He is Ma Ssu-tsung , 54 , the president of Red China 's Central Academy of Music , the vice president of the Union of Chinese Musicians and a deputy to the National People 's Congress . <P> Ma Ssu-tsung was a venerated musician in China and the composer of some 24 works for the violin , piano and orchestra , including a propagandistic Longing for Home that became the signature tune for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace with the Red regime until last June , when he and some 500 other cultural leaders were caught in the net of " thought reform , " as part of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution . Chinese army officers forced Ma and his colleagues to clean toilets and break stones in the morning , study the thoughts of Mao Tse-tung and write " confessions " till late at night-an exercise that lasted 50 days . Allowed to return to his music academy in mid-August , he was then set upon by the Red Guards and exposed to the humiliation he described in New York . <P> Very Fortunate . In December , Ma and his wife and two children , all musicians , somehow managed to flee from China to Hong Kong , where he sought asylum in the U.S. Exactly how Ma rejoined his family and managed to escape remains untold , but he is reported to have reached Hong Kong with other escapees in a small boat .

Many prominent writers who could not get away have committed suicide .

It was reported that Liu Shih-kun , topflight pianist and runner-up to Van Cliburn at the Moscow Tchaikovsky festival in 1958 , had his wrists broken by Red Guards . Hung Hsien-nu , Canton 's best-known opera singer , was tried by kangaroo courts , had her hair bobbed , and now works sweeping floors . Chou Hsin-fang , star of the Peking opera , and elderly Author Lao She ( known in the West for Rickshaw Boy ) have disappeared and are believed to be either dead or toiling in remote labor camps . Mao 's China is indeed a land where , as Ma Ssu-tsung put it , " art is a prisoner in shackles. "
