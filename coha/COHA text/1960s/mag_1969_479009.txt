The Spanish part of my life started up again in , of all places , Buffalo . I had gone to teach at the university there after the death of my husband , and very soon came to feel that the educators ? taking literally the overt expression of demands on the part of the young ? were missing the real signals being sent up by their students . Gloomily I thought about my own youth . In certain ways I had a lot in common with these students . I had spent my adolescence in New York coming to a precocious and shaky maturity in the heated " tomorrow we die , today we live " excitement of World War II . I was spoiled , much too rich , I laughed a lot , had a brother in the Air Corps to worry about , and of course I had everything ? a passion for politics , the AYD , millions of GIs , a beaver coat .... I was the child of something almost unique to New York ( in the time of the Depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimental education bestowed by upper-class bohemians and upper-middle-class professionals on their young . This education evolved in a certain number of special private schools in Manhattan and was based on a combination of elements : camps at the age of four , Jacob 's Pillow for the dance , a mishmash of Isadora Duncan ( lift up your arms to the sky and be free ) , trips across the Whitestone Bridge to get the feel of math ( we were way ahead of our time in that we studied the set theory ) , a week in a Catholic retreat to get the feel of the Middle Ages , uur own little settlement house in Spanish Harlem , to get the feel of being socially useful , visits to Washington , D.C. , to get the feel of politics , topped off by the ministrations of numerous artists and musicians whose function was to promote in us the illusion of our own genius . And naturally , as the basis of all this , lots of free time to give us the feel of being creative , In Dalton School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running things , and I remember , at fifteen , in a sort of reckless disgust at the whole thing , getting up in the assembly and with mock seriousness ( my spirit being &pater; the system ) suggesting , deadpan , that after serious examination of Dalton 's problems , I felt I represented the students ' urgent needs in demanding a free week each term . I reacted in shock and dismay when the faculty congratulated me for my initiative , and the damned free week did indeed become a permanent part of the Dalton system . I also became quite depressed ? I think I used my first free week , feeling angry and strangely betrayed , to date more GIs . For beneath that mocking request had been another quite different message , which had been so dissembled as not to be heard , the plea for authority . I looked sadly out of the window deeply discomforted at being presented to Jacques Rarzun as one of our more " original " students . One of the results of such an education is that it left its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this world but one 's own , and no authority but one 's own . It was very fatiguing . Not until , in my eighteenth year , I got to Europe did life take on some semblance of rationality for me . The war was just over . I sat in my room on the Left Bank , flicking the requisite number of ashes on the floor , and explained to a European friend that I was a failure in life . I had failed to produce a novel by the age of sixteen , I had failed to have had the ten major love affairs , also by the same age , and since I was lagging behind , I seriously considered that perhaps the best solution was an early suicide . He drew a deep breath , " You 're conceited . " It was n't the response I had expected , having been brought up on soul and understanding . " In Europe we do n't consider that we know enough at seventeen to be a failure , " and he scrawled over my walls CHARTRES , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never heard of . This may have been the first time in my life that someone had said No to me , certainly the first time I experienced listening to an authority other than my own . Dimly I could begin to see that my untiring effort to be original , which in a peculiar way had been an attempt to plume those in charge of my education , was quite the opposite of true rebellion Someone had finally interpreted the wild signah I was sending out . In convincing me that Tues. day followed Monday , that it was permissible to learn from others , to absorb from the past , in setting - firm limits to my wild behavior , Paco reduced my field of vision to what the French call la , vie a mesure . I looked at Paco in utter relief ; I felt I had been set free . I acknowledged the No and experienced the new sensation of tranquillity . I t was on quite another day in Buffalo that I thought of Paco again . Students were gathered together in one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Canada or resist the draft by going to prison . One young one with a fresh , innocent look on his face asked if he went into exile when could he expect to be let come back . The words " exile , " " prison , " and " come back " seared me . Unexpectedly I , who usually have no ability in that department , and envy those who do , burst into uncontrollable tears . A friend sitting next to me stared in litter amazement and offered me a hankie . " They must n't go to Canada , " I insisted . " Well , you would n't want them to go to prison ? " I thought about it for a while . " I might , I just might . " A year and a half had passed since Paco had been killed . He had been on an anthropological expedition in the desert near Baghdad when a truck ran into his jeep . By one of those freaks of life my husband died at about the same time . In a curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped thinking about the world , and thought about myself for a change . 1 , the great believer in confrontation , in " he who ceases to remember the past ... " etc. , by wiping out both Harold and Paco , indeed , by acting as though nothing had occurred in my life between the ages of seventeen and thirty-seven , instead of being able to speak with authority to a younger generation , I was doing exactly what I had accused my elders of ? keeping silent . P aco that day in Paris was using all his powers of persuasion to send me back to my studies , not only because he sensed my inner 3haos , but , I now realized , the chaos in himself is well . The two of us with some friends had just successfully engineered a prison break , taking : wo of Franco 's political prisoners out of Cuel ; amoros prison , near the grim , isolated city that Madrid was in the 1940s . Now we were back in ? aris , and beginning to realize for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staggered the Thole community of Spanish political refugees ' rom Paris to Mexico to Argentina , not to men-ion the security police inside Spain . The two of is stared at each other like frightened Bonnie ind Clydes of the intelligentsia . Spanish exile-tom in all its political varieties was waiting to neet us . Overnight we had been hurled out of ur respective previous existences : my ties with ife in America cut ; his home , Spain , now a placehe could n't return to . He had made of me a revolutionary heroine , which I was n't . " Sometimes , " Paco said wistfully , recalling Madrid , " it 's nice to have to see some old aunt you ca n't stand . " CHARTRES , DESCARTES . And on the other side of the room : To SAY THE TRUTH IS REVOLUTIONARY . WE SACRIFICE PERFECTION FOR THE QUICKNESS OF RESULTS BECAUSE WE CAN NOT WAIT . The idea of the prison escape had been hatched in a Sorbonne cafe . The very young Norman Mailer , then having finished a war novel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car with tourist plates . His sister Barbara and I offered to do the driving . Paco was the one who had contacts in both Paris and Madrid . Our plans were concocted a bit in the spirit of watching Humphrey Bogart at Loew 's Seventy-second : a touch of Quixote tilting at windmills , a soupcon of Paul Nizan ? Paco had practically memorized La Conspiration and A ilen-Arabie ? and a mentality picked up in an adolescence spent close to the Resistance . The real force driving Paco , though , was his rage : his father had been shot in the Civil War , and his childhood spent in the awfulness of a Madrid in effect occupied by the Germans . He wanted to make a gesture that would break the apathy of the Spanish people inside Spain , that would prove to those outside Spain that the interior and its people still existed , that would break the silence and erode the iron curtain that hung around the city of Madrid . There was , too , that desire to be able to account for oneself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as to set up connections between Madrid , the Basque country , Barcelona , and Paris , to lift morale and to distribute propaganda . I think he was absolutely determined that when he arrived back in Paris he would arrive with some of the pride of Madrid . By this time those exiles who had counted on Spain 's becoming free after the fall of Germany and Italy were completely dispirited and disheartened . There was no underground in Madrid . The anarchists had attempted to organize prison breaks and they had repeatedly failed . The central committee of the CN'I ' had just been smashed . The current mystique was that prison breaks were an impossibility . But , not even the Spanish police could have fathomed the strange workings of the adolescent mind . Nobody could have informed on us in advance because nobody but us knew what we were up to . What we did we did with complete insouciance . Not even Nicolas , one of the boys we were to take out of Cuelgamoros , knew much more than that Paco had told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely to stand with Manolo at twelve o'clock on a Sunday morning when the prisoners were to march near the Escorial in order to go to church . In the meantime , we spent our days in Madrid disposing of propaganda ? leaflets we had stuffed into a tire that we rolled with alarming casualness along a Madrid street . The night before we were due at the Escorial ( Nicolas and Manolo were working Wearily we decided to risk going to a hotel in the Barrio Chino ; Barbara and I stayed there . A Catalan girl hid Paco , Manolo , and Nicolas in her boarding house . In the afternoon at a caf ? we met our one connection with the underground who was supposed to supply us with a guide to get Nicolas and Manolo across the mountains into France . He looked at us with alarm and mumbled that the guide had disappeared ; if we waited he would try to find us another . But he also said that there had been a wave of arrests , Barcelona was not a safe city . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way or another , have a go at it on our own . We bought ourselves a map . I suggested that Manolo and Nicolas buy a compass and take sandwiches since they were to cross the mountains on foot ; they said I was being too American . Paco asked me if I thought we could get through the roadblocks . I said , well I supposed so , we would " think of something . " He made Barbara and me promise not to try to " save anyone " if anything went wrong . We left Paco on the outskirts of Barcelona , and drove through the mountains near Puigcerrla at night . Past the third roadblock , we slowed down the car to permit Nicolas and Manolo to jump ( nit , and arranged to meet them on the French side . The problem with the roadblock was that the guards marked on a paper the number of occupants of the car , and naturally the same number were to be at the end as at the beginning . At the last roadblock , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it was lost , he mumbled something about drunken American girls , and that was that . Getting through customs , which should have been simple , was difficult . The chief of customs called us both into his office . He was obviously more intelligent than the road guard . He had our itinerary because in those days every hotel stop was recorded by the police and stamped on one 's traveling papers : two weeks in a Madrid hotel , Madrid to Barcelona in almost impossible time ; a night at a Barcelona hotel , then zigzagging up to Puigeerda . It just did n't look right to him Angrily he questioned us for several hours , s show of rifles in his office , and nothing but us him , and lots of guards . He had the impatience of a man who did n't know exactly what he wa : looking for , and vaguely threatened to lock In up . I think he decided we were trafficking it pesetas . Well , better pesetas than prisoners , al though I was a little worried that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hayl revealed that the back seats were minus springs Finally he informed us that we had not change ( the requisite number of pesetas , and insisted W1 cash traveler 's checks and leave them there . figured any bona ride tourist would get mad , si we argued hack and forth for a while . Finall ? we reached some agreement , and he let us cros ; to Bourg Madame . When Nicolas and Manolo failed to show up m the French side , we telephoned Carlos in Pali and he then decided to ask the official Spanisl underground for help . He sent us to Perpignan ; at first they were wary , then when we mentioned Nicolas 's name ? Nicolas Sanchez Albornoz ? they leapt into action . " They have Claudio Sanchez Albornoz 's son , " they exclaimed . Claudio Sanchez Albornuz ( present president of the Spanish government-in-exile ) was an important figure in Spanish Republican politics as well as an internationally known historian . He had been attempting to obtain Nicolas 's release through official sources and finally had given up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn him over . The Spaniards in Perpignan advised us to go back to Paris while they immediately alerted sympathetic French authorities , who found Nicolas and Manolo when they stumbled across the mountains some five days later , and immediately turned them over to the Spaniards in Perpignan . When Nicolas got to Paris he sent his amazed father in Argentina a telegram telling him not to despair : he was alive , in Paris , and one of his lycee classmates had sprung him . It was a good thing we had cleared out of Barcelona . Right after we had crossed the border the alarm had gone out for the car and for Paco . By the time Paco got word that the four of us were through , the police were after him , He set out for the Basque seacoast town where his mother was summering , planning to see her , and get out of Spain via Irtin . Fortunately for him , the police gut there first . As soon as they left , his mother let out a shriek , yelled , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger brother and , being a practical woman , grabbed her purse , stuffed it with plenty of pesetas , and ran to the railway station , meeting every train and yelling Paco , until finally she saw him . She jumped on the train alongside him , prevented him from getting off , slapped him across the face , called him an idiot , and finally , with the ' elp of his brother and a childhood friend from San Sebastian , she smuggled him to another small Basque seacoast town where there were some fishermen . The fishermen told Paco to throw sis Greek philosophy book in the ocean ? he did n't .00k like any Basque peasant carrying Plato ? put a copy of ABC in his hands , a beret on his head , Ind pushed him into a fishing boat , literally hurlng him into France . lie tore a sheet of the ABC n half , gave his mother and brother half , kept calf , and told them when they received the other hey 'd know he was in Hendaye . The boat paddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and fired a few shots , but he threw iimself on the floor of the boat and with no more rouble got into France . Manolo 's fianc ? e , Ana , vas sent a message that everything had gone off right . What happened to Ana ? what hap , ened to all Spanish girls whose boyfriends left pain ? is that within months Manolo married a mre available foreign girl , who simply was here . Although my first reaction was shock ? ow could a man ditch a girl who waited for him 11 his years in prison and who had helped himit taught me a rapid lesson which saved me considerable trouble in life . Never play Solveig to Peer Gynt , never confuse left-wing polities with affairs of the heart , and make sure that when all the fighting 's over , you 're the one sitting at the breakfast table . During the month we waited for Paco in Paris , nobody talked either of our exploit or of him , What I mistook then for casualness was , of course , everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I realized what a vastly different experience from my own all this had been for others . Many more people than I was at the time aware of were watching that car , waiting and wondering on both sides of the border , and they were all paralyzed with fear . The alert had gone out to the more official Spanish underground , on the Perpignan-Toulouse-Paris route , and everyone was waiting and very , very quiet . The tension broke when one of his friends received calm of the last month was broken , everyone was excited , I wondered what had possessed me to dump Paco in favor of a new boyfriend , I suspect it had been fear . On the way over to Austerlitz Station one of his friends remarked to me with that blunt Spanish directness , that utter lack of sentimentality , a criticalness of everyone and everything which often caused them to say little nice about one another , to mock their own good qualities ? completely opposite from the French who are always announcing their own greatness and moral seriousness- " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a born leaver of men . Frivolous . As for Paco , have no illusion about that one . Intelligent , cold , beneath all that charm and wit , very cold . He 'd sell his own grandmother down the river for a political principle or a book . " I looked at him , shocked . " Two weeks , " he said . " I give you both two weeks . " They waited at the station , maybe twelve in all , raggle-taggle youthful conspirators , most of them children of refugees , some of whom had grown up in concentration camps in France , some of whom had been brought back to France from Mexico and other places by the Spanish government-in-exile after the war , Nicolas and Manulo from the prison , and Paco the only one who had actually grown up in Spain . At any rate Paris after the war was having enough trouble keeping herself together , and was not giving any Spaniards an exactly royal welcome . Paco got off the train wearing a Basque beret and a trench coat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and while the French stood by , wondering what these crazy foreigners were up to , they set up a yell that could be heard from one end of the station to the other , The air was filled with Bravo , viva el interior , viva el exterior , viva Espana , viva Madrid . The crazy trip was over . Five people had gotten out of Spain alive ? the dream had ended in total success . I ran toward Paco and threw my arms around him . Smiling we walked back to the car , arms entwined very much the way we had in Spain . We were about to get into the car , when someone very much on the periphery of the group called him aside for a moment . When Paco came back , his mood had changed , he looked sullen . He did n't say anything , I did n't say anything ; when we got to a cafe near the Sorbonne he excused himself , left everyone and went off by himself , saying he had to study for his exams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tall , blond-haired , now his black eyes looked extremely hard , and his mouth turned downward . In face of that much silent anger , I did n't know where to begin . " I do n't think it 's very nice after I helped you with all your political tra-la-la , not to even say hello . " " Nice ? " he exploded . " Now look , Paco , " I countered , " after all , you left , you with your hasta pronto , chica , leaving me in the middle of a God-damned Spanish mountain . " " Leave ? I did n't leave you . Should I have held your hand and waited to get us killed ? You 're mad . " " How 'd you know I 'd get out ? " I murmured something about being fundamentally very insecure , somewhat helpless . " Helpless ? Never , " he snapped . " Nervous yes , but my dear girl , you are not helpless . It 's an illusion you have about yourself . " He paused . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeating our joke ? " one way or another . " I tried another tack . " There were rats in the room . " I could see he was softening . " Shall I tell you something about life , Barbara ? In life there may be rats in the room once but never twice . " In the years that followed I constantly bumped into people who said they had met me in this cafe in San Sebastian , that caf ? in Madrid . They may not have known about our prison break , but Paco had been busy talking to people , all sorts of people . Who they were , what Paco wanted from them , or they from him , remained vague in my mind . I knew Paco had been disappointed in his conversations in Madrid . Those members of the older generation from the Civil War he had spoken to , and whom I think he had admired as a young boy , were sympathetic to his purposes , but they were tired . Many had been in prison , they wanted little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the students , in the 1940s they were barely beginning to come to consciousness . Of one thing there was no doubt : nobody wanted Franco . Madrid was just grim . Grim , defeated , fatigued , and hungry . Paco 's own friends knew little of that refugee life going on in France and Latin America . What they wanted was books and magazines ; who were Sartre and Camas ? what was going on ? They wanted contact . It was apuzzle to them that the outside world , and particularly Europe 's left-wing intellectuals , refused to even enter Spain : " Do n't they know that we are here ? " Many of those who had worked for the British and the Resistance during World War II felt , finally , completely defeated by the Allies ' refusal to remove Franco . Ours had been a comic voyage , a sad voyage . But many people had kept their eyes on our car , and I was to wake up one morning to find that I had traveled the distance from Loew 's Seventy-second and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . T he first sort of official visit we made to Span- ish refugees in Paris was to the musty offices of the most forgotten men in all Spain , the anarchists . By this time , another boy had straggled in , Pepe Martinez . He was shy , he wore glasses , hE was a young anarchist from Valencia who , after serving a prison term there , had walked his way to Paris . He stood looking at the sign near Notre Dame : Paris 0 kilometers , and he kept saying Paris 0 kilometers , Paris 0 kilometers , I 'm here Before we got there , Paco whispered to me " Rave you a sense of history ? " " A little . " " Then do n't forget today . " He paused . " Tel your grandchildren that you saw the last of the Spanish anarchists , the last of the real anarch ists , on a day , a very special day . " The government-in-exile he brushed aside , Ian the anarchists , they were wrongheaded , but the . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ; had truly lost , One does n't live in the past , bu one always pays one 's debt to the past . Pac , had n't known his father . He was a middle-of-the road lawyer . He had been shot right at the begin ping , perhaps by left extremists , perhaps la ; right . I think it disturbed Paco that he didn ' know which side . He told me how as a child h had watched through the window when some an archist extremists had taken his best friend ' father to be shot . The buy had cried to go along and the anarchists had laughed , grabbed the bo3 and shot the two of them , He admitted that a times , despite the fact that he had often worke for them , he had reservations about the anarcl ists ; he wondered about those assassins . But today our mood was lighthearted . W climbed the stairs , there was Ejarque , hobblin about on one leg . He looked at the group . A mo ley group , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Children of exiles , orphans ? children of tI exterior and interior , everyone , one way or ai other . had arrived in Paris . This second genera tion had made their own connections with or another . Symbolically , the iron cord aroui Madrid had been broken ; it was an end to decade of silence . In fact , the anarchists looked on us with amaz ment ; their fear had been that the generatii growing up under Franco would assuredly I Falangist . Not even Barcelona had connections with Madrid at that time , their interest in Paco was merely that he was the first one of this new Madrid generation they had encountered ... later of course he was followed by many others . But he was the first , no one had forgotten , everyone remembered , and on this day , in Paris , all of us had found one another . A generation given up as lost was not lost . When you are very young , it is hard to understand why there are tears in a person 's eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand why , when we breathlessly told him of our adventures , which had been successful , Ejarque did not laugh . He stared at us silently and hobbled over to the window and he simply cursed the French . They had their monuments , their beautiful Paris intact , but they had paid for it another way ? morally . Later he turned to me , and Paco pushed me forward . He started to speak to me very seriously , and I was a bit stunned to have emerged a revolutionary heroine . I was n't sure about much in life , but I was sure that I was n't that . He began to talk to me about America ; his view was old-fashioned , idealized ; he spoke of Emma Goldman , and I looked blank . " Chicago , " Paco whispered . I was on rocky ground . Then he told me that " Walt Whitman had written a poem about Spain , that I was the inheritor of a great tradition , citizen of the country of Whitman , of Thomas Jefferson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wondered what the United States government would have thought if they knew that in the mind , heart , and soul of this old anarchist , America was still the promised land . But he spoke of America , however wrong in his essential romanticism , with such majesty , speaking of America 's past in a way I had never experienced , my own education having been fashionably turned toward Europe , that he helped create a new notion in my head . Not the gracious offer that I could go down in the annals of Spanish history as one of its many heroines -- that idea had no reality for me , and besides it was nothing I could live by , nothing viable , and it was false . What he gave me was the sense that I was an American , and that I , too , had my own history . The problem was one of settling down after all this . How continue doing what one was doing and at the same time remain in France ? The latter was not always easy , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live legally in some parts of France and not in others . At that time they did not want Spanish students in Paris , there was always the problem of papers , and obviously few of the Spanish students would have cared to go off to the mining regions where they were allowed to live and become miners . So there was always the question of being semi-legally in Paris , Though we did n't live well , Paco and I had enough money . We lived like students ; the rest of the group had to worry about actually starving . And there were the Communists ? Chinos , wecalled them . Our group was clearly the heir of the POEM , the 1930s party of the Spanish socialist-anarchists , and anti-Stalinist . In the immediate postwar period French intellectuals for the most part were in a kind of Communist haze and not very cordial toward a radical left which leaned more toward anarchism than Communism . Still , there were exceptions . Esprit magazine ( left-wing Catholic ) often invited the group to their house on the outskirts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hush that came over the French when any of the group arrived . They stared and called them " les jeunes espagnoles . " Camus was rather friendly , and Merleau-Ponty . But there was no real rapport between the Spaniards and the French . The Spaniards felt embarrassed ? by all the speechifying ? to them the French were " mug franehute , " very frenchy , and when the French admired them , they so over-admired them as to annihilate their existence as ordinary human beings . Meanwhile Paco and Pepe Martinez set up a magazine somewhat modeled on Les Temps Modernes or Esprit . Until then exterior Spaniards had published nothing but pure propaganda ? the fate of Spain , down with Franco , and so on . Peninsula was to be a first-rate job , and also to look good . The magazine was a family affair ; everyone helped . As I could n't get into the Sorbonne with only a high-school diploma , I had lots of free time , and by this time , willy-nilly , I wrote in Spanish . Paco kept me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of light , personal essays on America , about pretty much anything that interested me , on the theory that no one in Spain knew anything about America , and anything would be news . One of the main impulses of the magazine was that of the group trying to rouse the older Spanish political exiles from keeping exile as the center of their existence , to alter their habitual " five cigarettes for the dying man in Toulouse " approach to the world , and get them to focus on Spain itself . We were out , in short , to erase the exile mythology , which none of the younger Spaniards wanted to have much to do with , and to provide Spaniards with some sort of intellectual base . We spent our days putting the magazine together ? afternoons in Belleville , finding Spanish workers who would help out on cheap printing presses , afternoons in Villejuif finding even cheaper presses , and evenings , reading proofs , etc . We sent copies back into Spain by any means available . Most of the Spaniards had foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant . One was n't too fussy about means . Basque priests , French booksellers , sometimes Paco , who did have a certain amount of gall , simply went to the Spanish Embassy , found a friend there , and used the Spanish diplomatic pouch for sending the magazine , books , and other literature to his brother in Madrid . Being young , we were playful , even at times with the Communists . One , at the Cite Universitaire dining room , would grab me . " Capitalista , " he 'd say , " paff ! Comunista ? paff ! " We assured each other we 'd die on the opposite sides of the firing line and was n't it a shame . Paco would watch , he admitted he envied me a certain playful capacity and at times I would deliberately say something outrageous to lighten his somberness . There would , for instance , be one of those high-flown European conversations on the meaning of life or the destiny of man , and I would suddenly interrupt , " And for women , men are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to watch Paco break up . He said every revolutionary needs at his side not a Rosa Luxemburg , but a scatterbrain , Meanwhile , going back and forth to Spain became a fairly routine thing ? though these trips were generally made through the mountains and no one ever attempted anything elaborate in a car again . Nothing ever happened to any of those who crossed back and forth ; ironically , all the bad things that happened took place out of Spain and had nothing to do with Franco . A young anarchist named Jesu , who had tuberculosis , and , indeed , did look like Jesus , wandered into the group . He had murdered several people with his bare hands , and I think he unnerved Paco and Pepe . He thought they were tainted with " constructive " ideology , and he was all for burning down the churches . Paco squirmed . He adored cathedrals . What got everybody down was Enrique . As bright as the rest , he had a tenderness to him that endeared him to them but lacked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the Gestapo by the French ; he had been sent first to Mexico and then brought back to Paris after the war . He never had a room of his own and often just slept in the main bathroom at the Cite where he had friends . One day he fainted , and after that , he vanished . His mother wrote from Mexico asking us to find him . The Spanish government-in-exile searched , we hunted the streets of Paris for him , but we had lost him . Sometimes , Pepe tells me now , he believes he has seen him . Enrique became the ghost that haunted everyone , Life in Paris became increasingly difficult . Some made it , some did not . One died in Indo china , another died of tuberculosis in Paris . It was a group that kept count of one another . Whenever anyone departed for Argentina or Peru , there was always a certain sadness , a sense of finality . The Spanish government-in-exile urged those who could to get away . Manolo went to Argentina and became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor . Carlos became a nuclear physicist in Mexico City . II I t was in April of 1968 that Nicolas came to see me . He had had political troubles in Argentina and was now embarking on a second exile , as he laughingly put it , in New York . We reminisced about the prison break . Nicolas was angry about the general silence surrounding Spanish politics , and I knew he was reminding me that among other things I was a writer and had never written one line on Spain outside of a few things on Spanish literature . He was in fact urging me to go back . / remember Paco and how he showed me where my father had fought at Saint-Male , the sinking American boats off the beach at Caen , the graves of the Resistance , of the Jews , Lachaise and all the rest , and how he once said that even the Germans had a right to their graves and he wondered where they had been put , and how he had minded when one of the old anarchists died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country like that , and how he was worried and he and his friends went to see the anarchist 's wife and son , and how every man deserves the burial he gives others . Paco tossed no one away . I telephoned his brother Raul ? who , with his mother , had been urging me to visit ? said this time I meant it , and a week later took the evening plane for Madrid . The brilliant early morning light of Madrid suddenly shafted the plane . Beneath me I could see the snow-tipped Sierra de Guadarrama ; I drew a deep breath and braced myself . I thought of the plane trip Amelia , Paco 's mother , and Raul had taken to Teheran , to collect his body , and another plane from Teheran that had pulled into Barajas airport , as mine was doing now . This was the first trip I had ever made to Madrid alone . I was coming as a widow , the mother of two daughters , a writer , and as someone who had belonged to Paco . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time I had gone to Madrid . I was not that much younger than Amelia had been when I first met her . I wondered if I thought of her then as being a widow . Paco 's father had been shot in the head . Paco was his exact age when he had been killed . I looked down at the mountains . Things were tense in Madrid in May . A revolution was going on next door , and despite the closed frontiers and cut-off communications , everyone knew many flags were flying in Paris . And among the flags flying was the anarchist . Students at the university were busy memorizing the " Internationale . " I spoke with M ? , a slight , gray-haired man of enormous personal charm and intelligence , to which one could not fail to respond . No one could . He is at the same time an ancient member of the Blue Legion , a former diplomat in Germany , and participant in some of the worst Nazi atrocities known to mankind . Now he is a leader of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an out-and-out leftist or tells you he is a Kennedy-type democrat ; generally , to orient yourself , it helps to take whatever label a man puts on himself and move it five places to the right ) . " Those boys in Paris ! " M ? exploded , " living it up , glamour revolutionaries , having the time of their lives . " He shot his words directly at me , employing a dazzling , pithy , slightly bitchy Madrid " verbalista " style of which he was known master . We were speaking in particular of Pepe Martinez , who had not gone off to Peru or Argentina but got into trouble in Paris and spent several years in La Chatergnie prison . When he got out , he got a job as a bookbinder and by one of those staggering efforts of will had gone the road from bookbinder to successful owner of a publishing house devoted to the publication of Spanish revolutionary literature . Our hopes for Peninsula had been realized under his direction in the enormously successful Ruedo Iberico . His collaboration with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Semprun ( author of La guerre est fine )  - -  an exile of earlier vintage who had returned to Madrid in the mid-Fifties and led the radicalization of the Madrid intelligentsia . " That anarchist , " said M ? , " in the service of Moscow , that member of the Parisian elite ! " Pepe had failed to oblige by dropping dead in the streets of Paris , and his very existence infuriated M ? . Still , I decided not to rise in hurt protest and make the obvious reply . For the least " Martinez " could have done was to have died for Spain . " One assumes , with idealists , that someone else will take the rap , " I replied mildly . He was silent for a moment . " Your eyes are colossal . " " Thank you . " " Purely objective criteria . " " Yours are too . " We moved on to knowing the consequences of one 's acts . M ? ' s program for the future in essence was to make some sort of alliance with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polities these days in Madrid is a cynical game ; the city is a sort of Alexandria , with everyone trying to slice a piece of the pie in advance . The next day , Bermejo , who is a writer and something of a poet , knows everyone in Madrid and is everyone 's friend , came to chat with me . He offered to put me in touch with " all the workers , all the students your heart desires . " I was cautious . If it serves his purpose of demonstrating how repressive Franco 's regime is to get you booted out of Spain , he would do so without bat ting an eyelash . Stilt I liked Bermejo . He gave one the feeling that in a Balzacian way he not only wrote about the day 's events in Madrid , he created them . I sensed Bermejo was laughing at the world , Madrid , the day 's events , and I , like his students , would soon find myself part of his day 's events . The other half of him is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of students ( everybody in Madrid has his grupito , the style remaining more emphatically Jesuitical than anyone is prepared to realize ) , is hauntedly preoccupied , sensitive in his nerve endings to the students ' being beaten . A moralist and humanist , Bermejo saluted the " heroic Forties " ? " our epoch " ? and then fired a few accurate shots at the super-Communist elite of Madrid : " A group of intellectuals conspiring like nomads in the middle of the Madrid desert . An enclave acting as if they owned this town . Communists ! Feudal landlords , and the sons of feudal landlords is what they are . Christ , if capitalism ever hit this group , they 'd be terrorized . For one thing , they 'd all have to go to work . " Many of the Communists are the sons of the great Falangist martyrs . Fundamentally , Madrid does not change ; the same small group of families juggle the wealth and social power among themselves . They constitute a world apart , engaged in its own private dance ? they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no connection to any other Communist party , to students , to workers , or the rest of Spain . Meeting them , one feels that one has entered the world of Johannesburg or Caracas , Incredibly chic , they speak to no one . A Catalan friend of mine arrived in Madrid . 1 have seen this friend , a cosmopolitan , at home in New York , Paris , as well as Barcelona , and though an " elitist " himself , I watched him pale at the sight of them : with this group he could not cope . He kept muttering , " Barbara , come to Catalonia , where we just have plain ordinary socialist revolutions , We have much healthier revolutions down there , Lots of sun , and left is left and right is right . " He looked at me and smiled . " Politics is not that important . The single most important remark you ever made in your life was that Mount Canigou was the tallest mountain in the world . Come back to Catalonia . " He left Madrid after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its hours , its craziness , and its Communists . I heard two Madrid friends discussing him , warily . " Who is he ? " " Oh , a member of the Barcelona-Paris elite , son of a Catalan industrialist . A little-Catalan . " Lo de siempre . Madrid does not speak to Barcelona , Barcelona does not speak to Madrid . Things in Spain may have changed on the surface , but beneath , much has remained the same . It was around midnight when I got through talking to Bermejo . That long , lovely Madrid afternoon , the time of day when the city is bathed in the most beautiful light in the world , was ending . I was going to meet Paco 's old friend , Pedro , for dinner . Madrid is a small town , Bermejo looked knowingly at me ? Pedro had a reputation for being the man " through whose hands have passed the best women in Europe .... " " He 's an old friend , " I said , but in Madrid nobody 's mind stays off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's disdain of great lover types . I had always had great sympathy for them , feeling that they had at least a certain humility about themselves and others . An acknowledgment of being needy , an intuition and perception , a willingness to reach . It never seems to occur to anyone that men who have had a large number of women are not superior beings in bed , but that they might have just wanted the women more , and they might just have deserved them . " Well , Barbara , " Pedro said , emphatically using my own name , " the first time I saw you , you were standing on a beach in San Sebastian , holding Pace 's hand . " We were sitting in the tavern where he and Paco had spent much of their early life discussing destiny and love , and he shook his head , " Paco was never a child , he was different from the rest of us , with his books , his revolution , " " Pare was no revolutionary " I replied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pedro looked at me in some surprise , some respect . " Yoe knew that ? " " Of course I did . He did what he did in spite of himself . Paco hated revolution . " Although I was n't clear in my head what was the exact difference between a man who acted like a revolutionary and did n't believe in it , and one who proclaimed himself a revolutionary and acted like a bourgeois . " You 're right ? but I would n't go around Madrid saying that . Paco was ... very authentic . A little like the man in the prison cell who shouts viva e ! comunismo before he gets killed , for the sake of morale . That 's all it was ? morale . " Amelia , Paco 's mother , Luisa , his sister , and I " ' drove to La Almudena , the large cemetery on the outskirts of Madrid where almost everyone is buried . Amelia and Raul , Paco 's brother , had had to fly to Teheran to bring Paco 's body back . Raul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never gotten over the feeling that by fixing it so he could not return to Spain , Paco had deserted him and so had not loved him . Raul said of Paco that he was " not really Spanish , " and had opposed his being buried in Madrid , Amelia , who had not fallen into Raul 's confusion and kept her clear and simple sense of who the enemy is , had her way . Paco , not permitted for most of his life to live in Madrid , was buried there . Amelia at seventy was still the regal , smashing beauty , and Luisa , the sister , was dressed up . She kept brushing the flowers I handed her , as though it all mattered . Then she handed them back to me . I stared at the names , " Roberto Martin 1936 , " " Francisco Martin 1966 , " in utter disbelief . I looked at the name on that grave and just stoodthere . Luisa had tears in her eyes . I just stared . Both women went through the Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , as though something amused Amelia about saying a Catholic prayer over Paco , she started to laugh and told me to ask Pedro , Paco 's old friend , the wild litany he and Paco used to invent as children , and how they tried , during the war , to bribe a man in San Sebastiin to throw a priest over the boardwalk , I handed Luisa the flowers , or she took them from me . She knelt down , and picked up a stone from the ground nearby , laid the flowers on the grave , firmly securing them against the dry dusty spring Madrid wind with the stone . Amelia looked around , she remarked that the graveyard was badly cared for and overcrowded . We walked to the waiting car , and suddenly , instinctively , I turned for a moment and looked back . We drove out of the cemetery . Amelia asked me if I wanted to see Pio Baroja 's grave in the civil cemetery across the way . He had been an old friend of hers ? all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worlds within worlds that exist in Madrid . I remembered Paco talking about him . No , I did not want to see any more graves . " Nobody went but a few of us and a few students , " she remarked . " Because it was a civil burial . Idiotic country . " In the car she turned toward me . " It was Emilio. " she said mentioning an older man , a Madrid lawyer , " that Paco really wanted to take out of prison . That did n't work out , so he went ahead with Nicolas and Manolo . Do n't you think it was generous of Paquito , always to help forging papers , to think of getting his friends out of , prison ? " " Very generous , " I replied , " He 's buried in Madrid now , " she said simply . " It 's finished . " On the drive back into town , 1 was wondering al nut , it all . Paco had hated exile , had always been afraid of dying in another country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still asking , did my brother love me ? why did he leave me ? And I was thinking of myself and Paco as children , for children is what we were . Both of us sprawled on the grass in Rambouillet , and I remembered suddenly pushing away from my skirt horrible orange-like creatures , " limacos , " and said they were called slugs in English , Then he said I had a had habit of calling all trees picitanos ? plantain trees ? and there were other , correct names for things . We read Spanish poetry , which gave each tree its own name , he said it was wrong of me to say that for me all trees were plantain trees . I said for me they were , it was like my saying that Mount Canigou was the tallest mountain in the world . I thought of the novels each of us read , sprawled out on the wet grass , and I wondered if either of us had really understood them . He with his Paul Nizan , La Conspiration , and A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political conspiracy and the desert adventure . And me ? me with my The Red and the Black . I wondered if then I had really understood what Stendhal was saying : that little girls like Mathilde , who see a man in the romantic light he wishes to be seen in , by their romanticism may very well end up with a dead hero instead of a live man . I was to think of this often in Madrid , especially when I met the third man in the prison cell next to Nicolas and Manolo ; he and Emilio were free now , and could come and go as they pleased . Their choice had been not to go with us , they had been older , Neither Nicolas nor Manolo could reenter Spain , Paco was dead . And I thought of it when I met Tierno Galvan , a Madrid socialist , and suddenly he asked me what had become of Peninsula , and I said , in those days we had had a hard time giving them away . " People were afraid , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked down . " He and Martinez were good boys . " And though he sounded apologetic , I wondered if too much and too little fear did n't amount to the same thing . I doubted I would ever advise my children to risk all . There were certain facts about ourselves Paco and I had simply refused to acknowledge , or if we talked about it , it was as something to be confessed , to be ashamed of . We were both the children of a very privileged class . My parents kept a summer place of some eighty acres on the Long Island Sound , lived in a way that scarcely resembled average American life . Paco , despite his slightly bohemian Republican mother , was a product of upper-class Madrid ? a group he was violently at odds with . There were enormous ambiguities in the lives we led . An American friend who once looked me up told me later that she was more than startled and slightly amused to find me sitting in a Left Bank room surrounded by revolutionary publications , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother sent his clothes through the diplomatic pouch , and he was lounging around in tweeds and me in silk dresses and straw hats . Apart from the way we dressed , which somehow we did n't " count , " we threw in our lot with Paco 's friends , the lot of the exiles . We did not dare acknowledge the numerous choices that were open to us at that time . Ifelt depressed . We drove back into Madrid , the kiosks full of half-news on the French revolution . Amelia and Luisa had decided T was to eat trout , and we went to La Trucha . With a tremendous command over life , Amelia 's eyes swept over the newspaper . " It 's our Paris , Martinez 's Paris now , " she said gleefully , I did n't tell her that Pepe did not share her joy ; repression next , was what he wrote . I listened to Amelia 's flow of words . My problem was that I tended to be " un stubborn " ? that I should learn to bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarked sadly , " I have never done , and neither Paco nor you had ever done . " She then began matter-of-factly to discuss the question of whom I should marry , casting her eyes around the restaurant ? if there had been a likely prospect , she would have yanked him over right then and there . Her mind worked along concrete lines . " The trouble with lovers isthat they tend to be someone else 's husband . A woman must always be first , that 's all there is to it . Twenty years younger , " she exclaimed , " and I 'd be in France . " She would , too . I looked at her : not an ounce of self-pity in those blue eyes . " The trouble with America , " she said , " is that even the poor drunks are alone . Dios , alone in the gutter . Here at least , " she waved her hand , " we put them together in a bar . Much easier . " I tasted the trout . It was first-rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restaurant . The wine made me feel good . Well , each of us buries his dead in his own way and I felt a sense of freedom , of expectancy , of " what next " grow in me . I grinned at her , and at me . From now on , just plain potluck . We walked out of the restaurant . Madrid , spring of ' 68 . " Was the trout good ? " " Very . " " You should learn to listen . " T hings in the suite of rooms where , Madrid-style , Tierno Galvan has his office and home and holds court , were in mild commotion . What one felt most of all , in Madrid this long spring , was the waiting : the frontier to France was closed , communications were cut off , the revolution was very close . He on the phone , calming down a worried parent . Her daughter was lost in the Spanish student pavilion at the Cite Universitaire in Paris , and he asked me if I knew anyone who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the next one 's and I shook my head . A sometime exile , Galvan had returned to Spain " por obligaciOn politica , " and it is just this sort of musty , old-fashioned political " I am the voice of goodness " that I suspect alienates people from him . His style was all off for Madrid , a town where people prefer saying , 1 am a son of a bitch . Nor was there much use asking him his own political program for Spain . Any direct question about what is to happen after Franco just gets sifted down to someone 's vague notion of the good society . The truth is , no one knows . The first time I saw Galvan it was in a Madrid caf ? , I was sitting drinking with some of the super-Communist elite . Individually , some of the most intelligent people in Madrid are in this group . Taken one by one , they are great . Collectively , as a crew ? mare znial ? the girls start acting just like upper-class New York girls : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social , civic , mental responsibility that acts in America as some sort of leavening force . And the men get busy outwitting one another . " There goes Galvan with ? . " They were entering a separate room with a group of men . " Do you know who they 're with ? The workers Los ob-reros , los pobre ob-reros , " they mimicked . " The workers . Screw the workers . " I tried to imagine a Communist in another country saying , Screw the workers , and could n't quite . Someone had just come hack from Badajoz , the Spain of the provinces , poor dreary dead spot near Portugal . " Can you imagine ? In Badajoz , they 're waiting for us . They 're organized . They 're reading our newspaper , they want material , they have a village poet , a lawyer , a worker .... " He sighed , " They called me sa.or . And asked about the high politics of Madrid . Such respect .... We really ought to do something about Badajoz . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Madrid . Listen , you idiot " ? her husband being a highly productive writer and a leading intellectual in Spain ? " that 's the first time you 've been treated with respect in twenty years . You get so mixed up you invite the police in to serve the drinks at your meetings , High politics of Madrid . " " I felt sorry for the poor bastard sitting out there in the hall , hiding in his raincoat .... " Madrid jokes , jokes of a town occupied with varying degrees of repression for thirty years . Almost as unreal as the words " Francisco Mar- " ' tin 1966 " on a Madrid grave was this new Madrid -- too many cars , streets torn up for parking , shopping centers , an annual parade of the Falangist army ( circa Wehrmacht ) which nobody watched , everyone preferring to spend a warm day at the book fair in the Retire where you could now buy Karl Marx and Lenin . Beneath this air of swift anonymous modernity ? a plague hitting Madrid like the rest of Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumble in a city waiting to change regimes , A student took me out to the University City . I had met many students along the Calle Princess , the Bold ' Mich of Madrid . They were caught up in a whole variety of struggles , the struggle for university reform , the struggle of the more radical groups ( FELIPE ) against the more conservative Communist groups ( PAcotsms ) , the Communists wanting to hold down the tensions , the others wanting full steam ahead and no more clandestine politics . Indeed , all of Madrid seems to be involved in a process of people naming each other , waiting to be named , and identified , after thirty years of semi-darkness . There was trouble in the Basque country , there were troubles in Barcelona . Nevertheless , I was not prepared for what happened . On a quiet day in front of the philosophy building in the ' University City , which lies out of Madrid on the road to the Escorial and was the scene of some of the worst fighting in the Civil War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the building before the door shut , and suddenly the flag went out . PHILOSOPHY FACULTY OCCUPIED BY THE COMMUNE Of MADRID . The words shook me . This , in Madrid ? The student looked equally shaken . He said , " ' Andy ? " Then he whistled and murmured they were suicidal ? some of the best students in Madrid were locked in that building . What was being done was in opposition both to Franco and to the official Communist party . A Spanish newspaperman came up , asked a few questions , then rapidly left , saying to phone in . The lawn was quiet , everybody looking for cover . The student grabbed me and we made a dash , jumping over the road that separates the Eeon- ' omy ( the " red " ) Faculty from the rest of the university . Just as we crossed , a battalion of security police , with trucks and dogs , rolled down cutting the road in two . I watched them climb the hill , then saw students running for protection . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world there is no use trying to compare which police are more brutal to whom . What struck me about this , and other melees at the university , is how cut off the Spanish students are , by virtue of the physical setup , from the rest of the city . You can have a battle going on at the university and within seconds the police can cut off the whole University City from the rest of Madrid . Eventually I got out of the place , jumped into a taxi , and met some friends with their children at , of all places , the American Circus , in the residential part of the city . Everything was peaceful here , and as I listened to them sing " God Bless America " I felt I might be going mad . My friend murmured that this was not half as bad as the Forties ; I who was friendly with Paco , why should I feel sorry for these middle-class students , the worst that could happen to them were beatings and three years in prison . She seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped at her that this was 1968 , and it was wrongheaded at the very least to ask these students to have lived through the most ghastly nightmare of the twentieth century , They could hardly be blamed if no one had ever told them or bothered to reach them . She finally agreed to drive out with me to the University City . As soon as she saw the debris , though , she tensed up , and she paled watching the line-up of security police cars . She told her children to keep quiet until we finally got out .. " The security police still scare me , " she said . O ne can better understand the confused web of Spanish politics ? whereby the Communists have played , certainly at the university , a conservative role , if one recognizes that despite the attention given to the Left in the press , France 's real problems are the maneuverings of the Right for the succession to power . Thus , in the spring and summer of ' 68 , Madrid was a giddy mixture of a city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height of " liberal " thaw -- intellectuals freely talking in the caf ? s , Marxist-Leninist books freely displayed at the book fair ? and then , odd pockets of severe repression . At the same moment I was receiving letters from Pepe , in Paris , which were extremely pessimistic in tone ? it will all end in the worst repression since the Civil War , he wrote ( and later was proved right ) . Intellectuals in Madrid were feeling their oats , and they seemed to be the last group to feel the government tighten up . As soon as one left the carefree atmosphere of the prosperous Madrid of cafes and industrial expansion , and went to the university ? where two battles were taking place , one with the police , the other between the Communists and more radical students ? one felt the tenseness , the quick meetings in caf ? s , one felt it among the local journalists , who , every time I met one , would also move from cafe to caf ? , do n't talk here , and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , one felt it most of all among the workers ' commissions ? the radicalization of the Spanish workers is still in an incipient phase , and ironically , was being accomplished partially by Franco himself . By outlawing the old socialist and anarchist trade unions , and forcing all workers to join a central syndicate of his own , Franco , in a sense , did away with many of the old left-wing rivalries , and united the workers into one group , providing them with a perfect setup for organizing . What Franco 's legal syndicate produced was the illegal workers ' commissions , and the young workers ' commissions ; and the workers in them represent a mixture of socialist , Communist , and liberal Catholic tendencies . I spent the afternoon with one member in his thirties ? like many Spanish workers today he had worked abroad . He knew little about the old socialist or anarchist trade unions , which at their height were a tremendous political force in Spain . Rut he had picked up political ideas ? become " radicalized " ? in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been his political education . Unlike an older generation of workers , he had allied himself with the students ; there was obviously some closeness between the students and the members of the young workers ' commissions . Madrid , though , is a very small town . A journalist I know casually remarked the next day that a friend of a friend of his who had a friend in the police had gotten a strange idea that this friend of his ( me ) had been speaking to someone in the workers ' commissions . The journalist laughed , as though it was uproariously funny ? which is the Madrid way of dealing with life ? but 1 took the hint , and spent the next few days shopping for clothes . I was also tired and tense from the panics and tumult at the university and decided to take it easy by seeing one of the editors of the newspaper Madrid . Madrid is financed and run by the Oans ? the powerful Catholic lay organization comprised of businessmen , industrialists , and military . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right of Franco , on the other , it is also a very politically adaptable organization , and , to the degree that most members are technocrats , interested in playing an economic role in Western Europe , interested in the business techniques of the United States , and less rigid and insular than the old-time Falangists , they are also to the left of Franco . They represent a tremendous power in Spain ? they have their own schools , banks , etc. ? and a tremendous concentration of wealth . In recent years , there has been a " left-wing " Onus ? which the newspaper , Madrid , represents . And , as one Madrid cynic put it , " The OPUS is an amoeba which knows how to cut itself in half . If the regime remains powerful , the half of OPUS which is in the regime slaps the Onus of the opposition . If the opposition and monarchists become powerful , the half of the Onus in the opposition slaps the Onus in the regime . Either way , they win . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place was in pandemonium . Minutes before , Franco had ordered the newspaper shut down . The editor and the publisher were to be fined and tried , ostensibly for publishing an anti-de Gaulle article , interpreted by Franco as a covert attack on himself . The act obviously had taken everyone at the newspaper by surprise . Politically a far more significant act than the uproars at the university , it was Franco 's first warning to the press of a new return to censorship . It was impossible to speak to the editor at that moment , and we agreed to meet several days later , at another place . During that weekend the building was stoned , the other press came out backing Madrid ; it was obviously an act nobody in the city had expected . Several days later I met with Calve Serer , one of the editors . I did not get the impression he had expected the shutting down of the newspaper . Employees would continue to be paid , he remarked , sidestepping any discussion of where the finances were to come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Onus as a wealthy institution , or his own role as being one of the chief proponents of a return to the monarchy , and instead , concentrated on his role as a liberal ? his concern for the students , the workers , his hope for a " Kennedyized Spain . " Like many other political Spaniards , his own past career has been a zigzag of different movements , meaningless when translated into foreign terminology , and his plans for the future include a vague stab at democracy , which could mean anything from a liberal monarchy to someone other than Franco . Many private dinners were being given that spring , among other things , to gain support among the wealthy for a return of the monarchy . I felt discouraged about Madrid politics . I was wondering how much of the musical chairs among the Right was a bill that was going to be paid for eventually by the Left and the moderates . I decided to spend more time in Madrid with what really mattered ? my friends . ut most of all I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm enough , he had his home in the country , he had his wife , the children , his career , his cafe life , and he was as jokey and witty as ever , but late at night , the two of us would sit on the floor of his living room , just talking and trying to figure things out . It was clear that he had not yet buried Paco . " He was a Madrid Basque , " I said quietly . I could not get over my shock that Raul did not consider Paco Spanish , that he felt Paco hated Spain . I sat on the floor and tried to explain to Raul ? what I took for granted that everyone in Madrid knew ? that Paco , Nicolas , Manolo , and the whole lot of them were obsessed by Spain , that the dream of every one of them was to come back . " Sometimes , it is n't easy to come back , Raul , " I said . " They are afraid ... to come back , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of earth that is my home . ' " Raul looked at me , " He said that ? " I nodded . Raul now looked so like Paco when Paco used to question me , what does Spain look like ? what are they doing there ? Only now it was Raul asking me , what was Paco really like ? Raul hesitated . " We were very close . " " I know . " We went through the many stories , comparing versions , of how they took a bus to the University City to see the front , how Raul fired a toy rifle and thought he had started the war by firing that shot , how the police would mistake Raul for Paco at the border , with the name " Martin . " Raul then recalled the signed copy of The Sun Also Rises he and I found in a small hotel near the Puerta del Sol , just sitting there in a musty room , belonging to no one . " We were very naive then , " he mused , " so dumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether we would take it , and then did n't . Some worldly cynics we . " He glanced at his copy of Light in August , that story of Joe Christmas 's fight that had symbolized so much for all of them and reminded me of how I had once brought it for him to Madrid . " Paco sent it , " I said . " That 's what he was sending you back , Raul , Light in August . " laughed . " Me , he made me memorize all of Spanish history . " " He did ? " I groaned , " Every last king you ever had . " He looked through the pages , and then at me . " Was my brother ? un hombre de bandera ? man of the flag ? first-rate ? " I was thinking of the day Paco arrived in Paris , how they had all called , Hurrah for Madrid , long live the interior , long live the exterior , and how Paco had never gotten his wish ? that these two Spains should know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death was real , and some things in life are irrevocable . Paco 's generation , the intermediate generation ? children of the Civil War , the second world war , and , intellectually , children of the nineteenth century had been a sacrificed generation . Those who had left Spain never really knew it , and never really came back to it , however they might dream . And those who stayed always knew something had been taken from them . Thinking of that time in Paris when we had been half-children , half-grown-up , the moment Paco had dropped Raul 's hand , and , growing up , took mine instead , I now took Raul 's hand , because what we were doing all those long months in Madrid was burying the dead , night after night , something nobody bothers to do in New York , where the dead just vanish into taxes and lawyers . III T my daughters arrived from America . It ? I ? was being with them ? those two daughters of mine , aged thirteen and fourteen ? and with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a final confrontation . I think I had made the mistake with my own daughters ? having myself been the daughter of a feckless mother and full of that old fear of repetitionof attempting to appear to them as the sort of woman I thought should be their mother , rather than of being myself . In a certain way I had done with them exactly what I had accused Raul and his contemporaries in Madrid of doing to their younger generation ? I had been very silent . I , great exponent of he who does not remember the past " ? how much of my own past had I actually let exist ? I took in , in utter amazement , their interest in the road to Brunete , the truth , the myths , the mountains crossed , and was utterly stunned to find them eagerly carrying , as did their elders before them , The Sun Also Rises ; they were off on their own secret voyage in Spain , complaining to me that we were on the wrong route , we were " supposed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to terms with my daughters ' adolescence , and myself as their mother . Amelia was amused at my concern , indeed dismay , when these three free-swinging , miniskirted girls took off with a couple of sixteen-year-old amateur bullfighters ( who would grow up to be lawyers ) at the University of Madrid . I listened to this brave , indomitable , pleasure-loving woman in her seventies bawl me out for not having the courage to let my own daughters " live a little . " She seemed terribly amused that I should raise such objections to bullfights , and in her free-spirited way , ignoring me , she told the girls exactly how to dress and what to throw into the ring . " You , " she said , scolding me , " were n't you free ? Was n't Paco free ? Did anyone ever deny you life ? " I watched my daughters , they seemed happier and closer to me than I had ever seen them before , and seeing them that way , I relinquished my somewhat too severe hold on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a caf ? trying to puzzle it all out . I thought of the novel I had published ? about a soulful timid girl who yearns but never leaves New York , and I wondered just what had been on my mind at the time I wrote it . Then I thought of the girl I had been ( not the one I thought I should have been ) ? women have a great tendency to see their lives in the terms of the men they marry or live with , and it occurred to me as no accident that neither Paco nor Harold , my husband , both very restless men , had ever come within spitting distance of leading a quiet life . A creature named Barbara had had something to do , after all , with her own life . I thought of the girl aged twelve , who was not at all the timid dreamer she so liked to pose as being , but a much brasher , less helpless type than I ever fancied . And for the first time ? as I stopped so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into what I thought it ought to have been ? my life took on some shape , had some continuity , some sense of having , at the very least , existed . The twelve-year-old with a copy of You Ca n't Go Home Again who had gotten herself down to the Smokies , forty miles west of Asheville , to see the red dust of America  - -  that twelve-year-old had been me , 1 had gone in search of the spirit of Thomas Wolfe , and stayed , dazed by the sight of chain gangs , dazed by seeing thirteen-year-old girls toothless , already old hags with children and houses with no doors . And the girl who had gone to Yucatan and sat at the edge of an excavation , figuring if a bus came , back to civilization ; if not , on to the interior of Yucatan . ( The bus came . ) Then Washington , because that was the political center ( or so I thought ) of America and finally Europe , in search of Trieste , Russia , Israel , until I found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was finally of an age , now , where I could admit , poor Mania , poor Papa . My poor dreamlike , fey mother , who had meant so well , who had wished she had been Edna St. Vincent Millay , and who had languished as the wife of a successful lawyer . Poor Mama ( children are never grateful ) who had tried to " understand " her daughter and had given her the freedom she so violently demanded . 1 remembered her calling me into New York City from Connecticut the August night that World War II came to an end . She handed me a bottle of champagne and sent me off to Times Square with a friend , " because if you are not in Times Square the night the war ends , you will never forgive me . " Poor Mama . What had happened to Paco and his friends had been shaped by history . But I had , largely of my own free will , entered the history of my own time . The sinking boats near Cherbourg , the eyeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of quiet , of people missing in the Jewish quarter near Rue Rosier in Paris , the canals and docks of Aubervilliers , where Paco and I spent so much time , absorbing the worst of Parisian misery . Later watching a film of Prevert 's ( property of the French Communist party now , one of those early documentaries never shown in America ) called Children of Aubervilliers ? " Les Enfants d'Aubervilliers , les enfants de la misere . " I remember the song in that film ? a fat old man in the Cine Club grunted , " Ah , que c'est beau ! " and a student muttered , " Beaucoup plus beau que vow , ViC21X con . " That was the mood of Paris after the war . The road between Metz and Strasbourg , with its monument after monument , its landscape of scarred earth and cows with bones sticking out , where Paco and I sat talking of my father 's war in the trenches , his father 's war in Spain , our war , at times so confusing ourselves we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your war , my war ? we were thinking about . Enrique , who vanished , one day laughingly showed everybody a copy of F. O. Matthiessen 's From the Heart of Europe which Matthiessen had sent him . He pointed with glee to a passage about " a Spanish orphan in whose eyes ... " and kept prancing around my room looking at his face in the mirror , " That 's me that professor is talking about . " " Oh , Enrique , " I said , and washed his single red shirt while he waited . We laughed ; it seemed inconceivable that any of us be considered " tragic . " But Enrique vanished . So there it was : history , Paco , IIarold , Martinez , Enrique ; and I wondered how you told children things ? not in an unfair way , " / was in the Depression , what do YOU know ? " but just in a way that they would know these people existed . Eventually we left Madrid , Spanish-style , lots of people at the airport , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I knew that I would be coming back ; Madrid is only six hours from New York now . Months later I was to sit with Nicolas in New York reading the familiar names of friends arrested , and Madrid was again a silent city , " Light in August " all over again . But at that moment Raul was joking , and called me " Barbara of the Pampas . " He said he would n't be at all surprised to get a postcard from me from the Pampas one day . This time , I did n't reply in outrage , " Who ? Me ? " Given the shape of the first half of my life , it now seemed to me perfectly possible that my middle and old age might include more of the same . People rarely change . At least I knew now just who was doing the adventuring . As a matter of fact , we ended up in Ireland , where I had never been . I felt more sure of myself traveling alone with the girls . Their utter trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going amazed me . I thought of Paco and how confident we had all been in him ? in his ability to get us past guards , rifles , etc. merely because he smiled and joked a lot and by now I knew that 's what life is , a sort of potluck affair , with everyone thinking the next one knows what 's going on . All four of us took to Dublin and Cork . There was a moment we inspected some odd flower arrangement , Close up , we saw they were artificial flowers ? some odd kind of burial wreaths . My younger daughter giggled , " Oh , that 's for them that 's in heaven . " We all laughed . Suddenly flowers and graves seemed to have little to do with us . The town of Cork with its ratty dry-goods stores , its fish markets , its dinky accountant colleges " one flight up , " its sense of minor business near the sea , the smell of fish in the town , and the harbor and boats of Kinsale , reminded me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown up on a rolling estate that is now a suburban housing development . I remembered myself bicycling down to South Norwalk , dreaming of my future destiny . I looked at the boats in Kinsale , thought , well , boats and harbors are pretty , after all . Then the girls went horseback riding , and they gave one of the girls an old nag . for some unknown reason , named Kerenski . The horse would n't budge . I just looked at them , and then I burst out laughing .
