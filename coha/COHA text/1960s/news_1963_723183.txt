txt Proposals that the state legislature authorize Chicago 's city government to increase its tax revenues by 50 million dollars or more annually were solimitted yesterday to the city council by Mayor Daley . No increase was suggested in property taxes . Daley 's plan promptly met vigorous opposition from the council 's Republican " minority and from Joseph T. Meek , executive secretary of the Illinois Retail Merchants association . List Daley 's Proposals Daley proposed state legislation to permit the city to : 1 . Increase the city sale 's tax , now Y2 of 1 per cent , to 1 per cent , adding an . estimated 25 million dollars annually to municipal revenues . 2 . Establish a new Cigaret tax up to 3 cents a package , which would produce about 19 million dollars a year . 3 . Place an excise tax on sale or use of distilled spirits , not to exceed 50 cents a gallon , or on alcoholic beverages generally " at a rate not to exceed some designated ' percentage of applicable state tax rates . " Estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much such liquor taxes could produce , some trade sources esti-. mated it would be 5 million dollars ? or more . The proposed legislation would apply to other Illinois municipalities as well . The plan was referred to a joint meeting of the , council 's finance committee and committee on federal and state legislation , to be held at 10 a. m . Monday . It is exbected the full council will act at its next meeting , Wednesday . The opposition leveled its at tacks on the specific proposals , the prospective uses of the additional money , and the wording of Daley 's 11-page message to the council . Daley pledged no reduction in property taxes if the additional revenue were made available . He said property taxes are destined to rise if his request is not granted , and opposed a legislative ceiling on the city 's corporate operating fund tax rate even if the new revenue is made available . " With these new revenue measures , municipalities could prevent increases in the property tax and in many instances could reduce property taxes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would put municipalities in a position which would make it possible for them to meet responsibilities now and in the future , without raising property taxes . " Daley said it is not the proposed tax ceilings which " will bring relief to the property owners . " He added : " I urge every home owner , every community development association , and every taxpayer who desires to lighten the burden of the real estate tax , and to insure that property taxes will not rise , to actively petition his representative in the legislature to grant the nonproperty tax sources to the municipalities in Illinois . " There is no escape from the blunt reality that unless there are other sources of revenue , property taxes can not be re duced . Property taxes will be destined to rise . This is not a partisan political issue . " Daley 's three proposals were among five ways of increasing the city 's nonproperty tax revenue which were suggested earlier in the week by the citizens committee on Chicago revenues and " expenditures , which Daley established early this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city be given powers to levy a payroll tax up to 1 per cent , which would produce an estimated 70 million dollars annually , and to license for revenue , instead of just for regulation . Sought Tax Ceiling A minority of the committee , including representatives of the Chicago Association of Commerce and the Civic federation , advocated a ceiling of $1.16 per $100 of assessed valuation for the city 's corporate operating fund , regardless of whether new nonproperty revenues are provided . The city 's 1962 corporate tax rate was $1.06 . A few minutes after the meeting ended , Meek telephoned the City hall press room to say he . would call a meeting of merchants in his organization " to oppose the increase in the sales tax with all our might . " He said the increased differential between Illinois and Indiana sales taxes would " doom the peripheral business man . " " I ca n't understand how the mayor in one breath asks that neighborhoods be rehabilitated , and in the next asks that they be killed , " Meek said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sperling Blasts Daley Ald. Jack L Sperling 50th , a Republican leader , termed Daley 's proposals " a subterfuge and a pretext to get around rejection by voters last year of 66 million dollars of proposed public works bond issues . " He said Daley wants to use the money for public works " and salaries of employes who will work on such programs . " Ald. John J. Hoellen 47th , a Republican , said Chicago is " ready for another Boston tea par ! y . " He said it appears to him " Daley is trying to find enough money to hire a new army of payrollers " and that " we ca n't decrease taxes until we get rid of the ever increasing army of payrollers . " Edward T. Scholl 41st , a freshman Republican , said : " People are sick and tired of taxes , and I was elected to speak up in their behalf . " He said he would vote against the plan and that " I 'm sure the legislature wo n't buy this . " Daley defended sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said that Chicago then was not providing adequate , services , and that property taxes had to be increased to provide them because other sour of revenue have been inadequate . State liquor tax revenues gave some dews as to how much the proposed city liquor taxes might provide . For the state as a whole , $26,470,838 was collected in 1962 from t h e state 's distilled spirits tax of $1.52 a gallon . A tax of 1 cents a gallon on beer produced $11 , - 459,623 , and taxes of 23 to 60 cents a gallon on wine produced $4,187,430.
