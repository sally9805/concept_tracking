At the moment , Teddy Green is a car salesman in Boston . He is a pretty good one , too , with an unusual spiel . He tells customers that Fords are reliable and have great pickup-which is why he always chose them when he was stealing getaway cars . For Teddy Green used to be a bank robber ; he got out of jail just four months ago . " I feel like Lazarus , " he says , risen as he is from the living death of what was once a 56-year sentence . Unlike many ex-cons , however , Teddy has refused to mope , instead is coping by making a virtue out of his background . There is hardly a Bostonian who has not heard his story . He has been invited to lunch at the Harvard Club , addressed Wyndham girls ' school , and appeared on radio and television . A twelve-part series under his byline has just finished running in the Boston Globe . <P> <P> He has plenty to tell .

Caught and locked up , he proceeded to pry a board out of a fence around Mattapan State Hospital , where he was under observation , and began an ancillary career : jail breaking . When the police got him back , they kept him for five years ; when he got out , he says , " you might say I took up bank robbing as my vocation . In about two years , with various accomplices , I made eleven withdrawals . There was n't much planning-none of that movie stuff with diagrams and stop watches . We 'd just pick a likely spot , go in and do the job . " <P> Cheering Section . Eventually fingered by an informer , he got his 56-year sentence in 1952 .

Back he went to Charlestown . Next , he and five others managed to sneak in some guns and build a ladder . The idea was to pin down the lone tower guard with gunfire and climb the ladder over the wall . Everything went as planned , except that at the key moment two of the cons jumped on the ladder and it came crashing down . " This was broad daylight , " remembers Green , " and all 300 inmates were watching . It must have been the first break in history with a cheering section . They were hollering : ' Get that ladder up ! ' When it crashed , everybody yelled , ' Get it up again ! ' " <P> They did not ; several months in isolation followed . But Green was not cured .
