It is no secret around Washington that Lyndon Johnson would like to become the first President to appoint a Negro to the U.S. Supreme Court . Last week , Johnson did the next thing to it when he named Federal Judge Thurgood Marshall , 57 , to the prestigious post of U.S. Solicitor General . Marshall will replace Archibald Cox , 53 , a former Harvard Law School professor who is resigning after four years of Government service . <P> As chief legal officer for the N.A.A.C.P. , Marshall became a national figure in 1954 when he successfully argued the landmark school-desegregation case of Brown v. Topeka Board of Education before the Supreme Court . In all , he argued 32 civil rights cases before the high court , won 29 of them . In 1961 , President Kennedy appointed Marshall to a lifetime job on the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals ( New York , Connecticut and Vermont ) . After almost a year 's delay because of the objections of Southern Senators , the Senate finally confirmed Marshall 's appointment . <P> If approved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General and the first Negro to hold the office . Wearing the traditional garb of swallowtail coat and striped pants , he will argue the Federal Government 's most important cases before the Supreme Court and have considerable say about which cases the Government takes to the Supreme Court on appeal . <P> In making the appointment , Johnson described Marshall as a " leading champion of equal rights under the law , " noted that he was taking the new job , which pays $28,500 a year-$4,500 less than his federal judgeship-and has a tenure subject to the President 's pleasure , at a " very considerable financial sacrifice . " Marshall might find that sacrifice worthwhile-if there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court while Johnson is still in office . <P> Last week in other appointments , Johnson named : <P> &gt; Leonard Marks , 49 , a Washington communications lawyer , and a close Johnson family friend who has represented the family 's Austin radio-television station since 1952 , to become director of the U.S. Information Agency , replacing Carl Rowan , who has resigned . Marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Federal Communications Commission , has represented the U.S. at international conferences on broadcasting and communications , is presently a board member of the Communications Satellite Corp. , the Government-regulated organization that owns the Early Bird satellite . Known as a first-rate administrator , his appointment to the $30,000-a-year post is viewed with wariness at USIA , where the chief concern is Marks 's lack of knowledge about the countries in which the agency operates . Said one top USIA staffer about the appointment : " There are no great screams of enthusiasm . " <P> &gt; Dr. Penelope Hartland Thunberg , 47 , an expert in international economics for the Central Intelligence Agency , to a vacancy on the U.S. Tariff Commission . A winner of the 1965 Federal Women 's Award for outstanding Government career service , Dr. Thunberg was notified of her appointment only two hours before she went to the White House to be introduced during President Johnson 's press conference .
