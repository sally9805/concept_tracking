No physician and no machine can forecast with certainty whether a man will have a heart attack , or when . Until such prevision becomes possible , doctors must rely heavily on the electrocardiograph , which , although not much of a predictor , is a smart detective . It can usually reveal whether a heart has been damaged , and with these clues the cardiologist can prescribe care and treatment for patients who seem to run the greatest risks of heart attacks . Yet the electrocardiograph has identified only a fraction of the nation 's ailing hearts . <P> One reason is that the ECG is relatively expensive ; each reading costs an average of $15 or more . Another reason is that there are too few expert cardiologists to read all the ECGs now taken , let alone the millions more that a truly effective preventive-medicine program would demand . Now , in an application of transistor-age electronics , a compact new machine enables technicians to do the initial screening , and select for the cardiologists ' attention only those ECGs that contain warning evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chemical 's Humetrics Division , the device is called ElectroCardioAnalyzer . It is a miniaturized computer as well as a simplified electrocardiograph . By comparing a subject 's graph with fixed standards that have been programmed into the machine beforehand , it can detect abnormal electrical activity in the heart . When it - does so , warning lights flash on , and the technician knows that this patient must be referred to the cardiologist . <P> The machine is about the size of a bread box and weighs only 28 lbs . It can be wheeled into a factory or installed in an out-patient ward , plugged into any standard electrical socket , and can handle as many as 20 subjects an hour . To achieve this simplicity and speed , the machine records only five electrical stimuli per heartbeat , as against the standard machine 's 13 . These five are sufficient for basic screening . Since what is adjudged normal in an ECG varies with the subject 's age , early models of the analyzer were set for use on only the age bracket of the volunteers being tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which the technician can select by a simple dial . <P> At Los Angeles ' White Memorial Medical Center , the Analyzer was ranged against cardiologists using ECG machines . The new device thought it saw abnormalities in 5.6% of cases where they did not exist , which only meant a bit more work for the experts . On the other hand , it failed to detect a real abnormality in 2.7% of the cases examined . But Thiokol scientists say this percentage can be reduced by technical changes .
