The autopsy report on President Kennedy was on its way to the special investigating commission headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren , and had not yet been made public . But " unofficial " word of its contents was given to Washington newsmen last week . <P> The autopsy was performed at the Naval Medical Center at Bethesda , Md. , and its findings differed in significant respects from earlier reports by doctors at Dallas ' Parkland Memorial Hospital . The Parkland doctors ' only interest had been in trying to save the President 's life , totally forlorn though that hope was , and they took little time for closer examination of his wounds . <P> Thus Parkland doctors thought that one bullet struck Kennedy in the throat , just below the necktie knot , another in the back of the head , and either would have been fatal . But the autopsy indicated that the first bullet had struck Kennedy in the back , some six inches below the collar line , and that the throat wound had been made by a fragment of the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parkland doctors , who worked over Kennedy as he lay on his back , apparently missed the first wound . And it might not have been fatal . The bullet had penetrated but two or three inches , perhaps after ricocheting from part of the limousine , and it struck no vital organs . <P> The implication was that if President Kennedy had been shielded or thrown to safety on the floor of the car in the 5-sec. interval between the two shots , he might have survived . A Secret Serviceman , trained to react quickly in such emergencies , might have done just that had he been stationed close enough to Kennedy . One agent rode in the front seat of Kennedy 's car in Dallas , but there was no way for him to scramble back to the President 's aid in time . Kennedy himself had always objected to agents flanking him closely ( particularly when campaigning ) , and by his own order there was no agent at his elbow in Dallas . <P> Meantime , the seven-member Warren commission moved ponderously ahead with its work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its five-volume report , told the State Department that it too must flesh out its findings about the background of Assassin Lee Harvey Oswald . " They are summary reports in more or less skeleton form , " said Warren , " and in order to evaluate them , we have to see the materials on which they are based . "
