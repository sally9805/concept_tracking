txt Communist East Germany has proposed a treaty of normalization between the two Germanys on terms certain to be rejected by Bonn . The draft treaty would require West Germany to recognize the Communist German Democratic Republic ( DDR ) accept the Oder-Neisse frontier with Poland , and declare invalid the Munich Agreement of 1938 which Hitler forced on Czechoslovakia . Bonn also would be obliged to cede its sovereignty over West Berlin which would become an " independent political entity . " After these and other conditions had been met the draft treaty said it might be possible for both regimes to work toward a " peaceful settlement of national questions . " Suggestion repeated The East Germans , in other words , have simply repeated a shopworn list of Communist demands . These " maximum " demands were termed " unacceptable " by an official Bonn spokesman . But he promised a careful government study of the East German document . Accompanying the treaty draft was a letter dated Sept. 18 from East German Premier Willi Stoph to West German Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either in Bonn or Berlin . In the past , Dr. Kiesinger has rejected such a meeting until lower officials on both sides had worked out the preconditions from which the chiefs of government would negotiate .

The East German reply came in a letter from Mr. Stoph dated May 10 . The DDR leader proposed a top.level meeting based on the premise that West . Germany would recognize the DDR as a sovereign state . Though its contents were unacceptable , Mr. Stoph 's letter made history in another way . It was the first such message officially accepted by a chancellor of the ( West ) German Federal Republic . On June 13 Dr. Kiesinger replied that recognition of the DDR was out of the questtion . But he affirmed the right of the East German people to decide their own future , Bonn remained ready to improve relation : in the divided land . Mr. Stoph 's new letter and its accompany . ing draft treaty are the latest episode in this dialogue which appears to have moved neither side a whit closer to the other . If anything , Mr. StophYs demands are couched more sharply , more categorically than ever .
