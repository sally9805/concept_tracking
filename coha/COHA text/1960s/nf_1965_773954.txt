txt // Sometimes you get a good buy in this kind of merchandise at the grocers. 7 . Dog and cat foods can eat a hole in your budget . Most stores have weekend specials . Compare them . Canned dog food contains water which is absent in dry dog food . Buy the dry and add the water yourself . It 's cheaper . Usually dry dog food is a better buy when purchased in large containers . Compare grocery prices with those at discount stores . However , remember that large quantities deteriorate while standing around waiting to be used up . If you ca n't use a 50-pound bag and ca n't share it with a neighbor , it 's better to buy a 25 or 10 pound bag . If you 've started your dog on fancy foods like home cooked liver , naturally , he 'll probably prefer that to commercial dog food . The trick is to start him on commercial dog food and not let him develop extravagant tastes . 8 . Buy cigarettes by the carton . Price per pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the average American cigarette smoker smokes an average of 18.7 cigarettes per day , or approximately 341 packs per year , and pays an average 28.2 cents per pack , or approximately $96.16 per year . If the cigarettes were purchased by the carton at an average of $2.60 , the cost would be $88.66 per year ? a savings of $7.50 over buying by the pack . If the carton were bought at a discount store , with an average price of $2.40 per carton , the savings , obviously , would be greater ? $14.32 per year per person . So , if you smoke , to save money , buy by the carton , preferably at a discount store . TO SAVE $$$$$ TIPS ON DETERGENTS AND CLEANERS 1 . The kind of detergent to use in your washer and dishwasher depends on the hardness of your water supply . High-suds detergents may cause trouble with your equipment and some appliance manufacturers advise using low-suds detergents . // Call the factory authorized repair company for your brand of washer and ask them to suggest several brands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again in the new location as the water may be different . 1 2 . Because of the tremendous number of sizes of detergent containers and the difficulty of determining the cost per ounce , housewives usually have no idea which brand is the best buy . Best guide is to watch for sales and to compare costs of identical products in several stores . 3 . Although some detergents are advertised as " all purpose , " most housewives get better results through use of several types . Scouring powders usually are preferred for sinks , mirrors respond best to sprays although for mirrors and glass you can get just as good results at big money-savings by mixing 1 tablespoon of household ammonia with 1 quart of warm water . 4 . " Self-polishing " floor preparations that clean and wax in one operation are costly and not nearly as effective as a detergent for cleaning and a wax for waxing. 5 . Liquid laundry bleaches are mostly water . Most brands contain identical chemicals , but the well-known brands cost much more than the private brands . Check the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I found : In one store there were three brands of liquid bleach each in 1 gallon plastic containers . All listed their ingredients as " sodium hypochlorate 5.25% by wt. , inert ingredients 94.75% by wt . " For one gallon , one brand sold for 67 ? , another for 49 ? and the third for 39 ? . Since the inert materials essentially are water , I buy the 39 ? brand . 6 . When it comes to face soaps , you have a wide choice of colors , shapes and scents , unless you have a skin problem , in which case , the doctors should prescribe for you . Best buys in soaps usually are in department , drug or discount stores where you can buy bags of assorted soaps at discount prices . 7 . Take toilet soaps out of wrappers and store . They 'll dry out and you wo n't waste as much when you use them . // Cut Your Clothing Costs Do you know how to select clothing to get the best for your money ? This involves selecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers to questions about shrinkage , unstandardized sizes , fading and the cost of homemade garments as compared to ready made . On the Average .. . How much should you spend for clothes ? Only you can give the answer . I think it 's unrealistic to suggest how much you should allocate for clothing each year . The total amount you do spend depends largely on three factors : your income , where you live , and the size of your family . According to Government studies , people in the higher income brackets spend more $$$$$ and a larger percentage of their income on clothes than those in lower income brackets . There 's a tendency toward ostentatious display . If you 're in the mink stole class the likelihood is that most of your friends have mink stoles whether they need or even use them frequently . I 've seen women , miserable from the heat , wearing fur stoles on a warm night in Florida . Many people are under the impression that white collar workers spend a much larger proportion of their income 92 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Government studies , the difference is negligible . Both spend around 10.5% of their annual income on clothes . The self-employed , clerical workers and salespeople spend slightly more . The unemployed and retired , naturally , spend less . Buying patterns are influenced by where you live . In warmer climates where it 's customary to wear more casual clothes , people not only save on the clothes they do buy , but on the clothes they do n't buy . They are spared the expense of costly outerwear , boots , shoes and in many cases , underwear and outerwear which are needed as protection where temperatures drop and different sets of clothes are needed for each season . Another factor influencing clothing expenditures is the ages of the members of the family and the size of the family . Clothing bills for smaller children and frequently for the elderly are lower than those for teenagers and adults . Price lines for some types of clothing have been increasing . I remember when good-looking budget women 's party dresses sold for $10.00 . " Popular priced blouses " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Men 's suits and children 's dresses show similar increases . What this adds up to is that over the years your clothing bills necessarily have been going up . Increases in the minimum wage , which are an important cause of high costs in clothing , are also reflected in your income , making it possible for most people to spend more than in the past . Does this mean you ca n't cut your clothing bill ? Definitely not ! But it does mean that you must become a more careful shopper . It may mean changing your buying habits . You must learn to watch the ads for sales , examine the merchandise , read the labels , ask the salesperson for information . Do you do these things now , or are you afraid the sales people will think you 're a pest ? Remember , it 's your $$$$$ you 're // spending . The store expects you to pay the price for its merchandise and you have a perfect right to know what it is they are asking you to pay for . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit properly , wear well , and are sensibly priced . But this is the way most women shop today . Does the description fit you ? You decide to buy a new dress . . . not more than $29.95 . You rush to your favorite store , look the dresses over , pick out a few , try them on , find one that looks attractive , say , " I 'll take it " . . . and that 's it ! That definitely is not the way to save $$$$$ on clothing . The rest of this chapter will be devoted to information that should help you become a better clothing shopper . Keeping Up with the Joneses Some people are miserable unless they have the same things their neighbors or friends have . They simply can not resist the urge to buy , even though they realize the purchase is not really necessary . What about you ? Does the need to keep up with the Joneses gnaw into your clothing budget ? I know families who , every Easter , purchase complete new outfits whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little need for suits , buy new spring suits year after year . Are you an Easter shopper ? If so , when you buy the new suit or dress , do you also get a hat and shoes and purse to match ? What about the shoes in your closet ? Are n't there any that will do ? Do you buy hats for your little girls that they wear only a couple of times ? These are extravagances that eat into your income . Ever check the price of little girls ' hats right after Easter ? If you 're child does wear a hat for dress-up , buy it then . If you 're trying to save $$$$$ on clothing , one of the worst times to buy almost any outerwear is before Easter . // After Easter , on the other hand , is one of the best times to buy . Many women feel that ? with the possible exception of Dad ? every single person in the family needs a complete new outfit at Easter . Why not at Christmas , too ? The way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at sales . Unless , of course , there 's an emergency . Obviously , if one of the children has suddenly worn through his shoes , or outgrown them , you ca n't wait for a sale . Most stores have clothing sales and clearances after Easter and beginning the first of January , the first of July , and at the end of the month throughout the year . Watch the ads . With the money you save on clothes , you can get something the Joneses do n't have ? peace of mind when it comes to bill-paying time , or maybe a vacation trip when they stay home . How Stylish Are You ? To get the most out of your clothing dollar , you want clothes that not only are durable but remain attractive long after you 've bought them . Now we 're talking about style . And there 's a difference between good style and " stylish . " Does the fact that shifts are the style one season mean you should wear a shift even if you 're overweight and will look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your size and age and if you want clothes you can wear a long time , steer clear of high-style fashions , even if they do look good on you . Most styles change so rapidly that dresses a few years old look completely outdated . The chances are that even if shifts should look good on you , an expensive one would not be a good buy because it would not be wearable nearly as long as a less readily dated dress . When it comes to style , do n't let a saleswoman kid you into buying something she says is chic that you think looks impossible . Analyse yourself and decide what looks good on // you and what does n't , what feels comfortable and what does n't . Then buy what you think is attractive on you , regardless of current fashion or the salesperson 's flattering recommendations . Buying new accessories like purses and shoes to match new clothes is a waste of money if you have wearable shoes and purses at home . You 'll save money if you select basic color schemes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hats and shoes , consider them when you choose a new dress or suit . Pink shoes to wear with a pink dress and blue shoes for a blue dress will always mean extra pairs of shoes . That 's extra $$$$$ for shoes . It 's economical to buy basics and to stick with them ! Special dresses or suits for special occasions are costly . The clothing home economists are n't kidding when they talk about having a " basic black " that can be dressed up or down with accessories . Everyone , however , ca n't wear black , It makes me look colorless and gloomy . My basic colors are shades of red , pink and orange . If you need a new dress for a special occasion , select a color and style that will be useful many other times and give normal wear . There 's nothing more wasteful than having a closet full of things you 've worn only a few times and have no further use for . Why do n't you go to your closet today and pull out the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wrong . Tired of the color ? The style wrong ? The fit bad ? Your husband does n't like it ? Outgrown it ? This kind of exercise may be painful , but it will make you face the fact that you misspent some clothing $$$$$ in the past and it will help you avoid making the same mistakes in the future . There 's another advantage to doing this . You may be able to salvage something . See if an alterations tailor can remake , let out or take in some things . Maybe your dry cleaner can save a dress by dyeing it . // Buy By Size ? During World War II , the Government suggested that clothing companies get together and standardize the size of many items of clothing . Since then , there has been some haphazard standardization on a voluntary basis . Practically nothing , however , has been done in women 's clothing . Sizes of shorts and slacks , ladies ' dresses , suits and coats vary from one manufacturer to another . And since some manufacturers cut more generously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one brand , while you may find you wear a 16 in another . The Government has set up specifications for sizes ( known as " voluntary trade standards " ) for certain items including : hosiery lengths and sizes ; men 's and boys ' pajamas ; men 's work trousers and certain underwear ; boys ' trousers and outerwear ; and boys ' , girls ' and infants ' cotton knit underwear . In time , the list undoubtedly will grow . Still , until all manufacturers use the standard , the result will continue to be confusing and costly for you . A company manufacturing boys ' pajamas for which voluntary standards have been written may follow the Government specifications regarding sizes . ( Those that do may list this fact on their label . ) The present problem is that some do and others do n't ! You know ? or do you ? ? that your son weighs 62 pounds , is 4 feet , 6 inches tall and that his chest measures 261/2 inches . Do you know what size to buy when he needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government 's design and recommended measurements , he is too large for a size 8 and requires a 10 . If they are not made according to Government specifications , the right size for you to buy is anybody 's guess . The manufacturer can cut the fabric as generously or skimpily as he wishes . If your retailer carries four different brands , " 1 " or " 2 " or " 3 " or " 4 " may be cut in accordance with Government specifications or // according to the bosses ' patterns . The only way you can tell how to buy is to give the boy 's measurements to the clerk or bring along an old pair of pajamas and compare the new with the old . But cheer up ! Pajamas are n't nearly as difficult to select as girls ' shorts , slacks or dresses ! The manufacturer of Buster Brown girls ' and boys ' cotton knit panties and briefs have size charts printed on the plastic bag containing each garment . They list weights and sizes . The AMC Department Stores retail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizes . Another AMC brand , Cranbrook boys ' T Shirts lists weight and chest measurements . These firms are trying to help you select proper size garments for your children . An easy rule to use when making purchases for children is to take chest , weight and height measurements for garments covering the upper part of the body . Waist , weight and height for the lower part . These are the Government measurements for girls ' underwear . It is slightly different from the boys ' : To obtain the correct length of slacks , trousers , or shorts , if possible , measure a pair you already have . Lay the garment on a table and measure the inseam from the crotch to the bottom . Here are the Government body measurements and the sizes that go with them for boys ' pajamas , T shirts , knitted sports shirts and trousers . For the trousers , use measurements for height , weight and waist . For the other garments , use height , weight and chest . Size is important in stretching your clothing $$$$$ be-cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose last T shirts were size 38 , needs new ones . You go to the store . There are several brands . The T shirts are in sealed plastic bags . You peer through the covering , note that Brand A is sanforized , you know this means there will be less than 1% shrinkage and so buy this one . However , Brand A may be smaller or larger than the same size in Brand B or Brand C. This can increase the cost . Here 's how : Say you buy three Brand A T Shirts in your husband 's size ? he tries one on . It 's too tight . It costs you money to go back to ex-change it . Now , what if your husband puts one on , he 's in a hurry to get to work and when he returns at night he tells you the shirt is snug . You can return the two he did n't wear , but some stores may refuse to credit you with the one he has worn . Then you 're out the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To keep expenses at a minimum , buy your husband 's regular brand . If there 's a sale on another brand , tell the clerk the size your husband usually wears , his weight , height and chest measurement . Or better yet , if the store carries his usual brand , compare the sale item with his regular size for length , width and other factors . If he has no favorite , get a salesperson who is familiar with the stock to tell you whether a particular brand runs large or small . Clothing not tried on in the store should be tried on at home before it is worn . // This may take a few minutes longer , but it will help protect your clothing investment . One of the big puzzlers with sizes , particularly of shoes , is that not only do many brands differ in size , but some manufacturers do n't even standardize all of their own sizes . Sport shoes are made on a different last from dress shoes . You may need a larger or smaller size in a sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . When buying shoes , vanity can cause you to spend money foolishly . Are you proud of your small feet ? Do you always ask for a size 7A and wonder why you have corns or bunions ? Suppose a salesman shows you a 7A shoe that fits , but that you do n't like the looks of . Then , he shows you another style that you love , also 7A , but this one pinches . What do you do ? What you should do is take neither . Maybe he has the second shoe in a more comfortable size . If he does n't , look for something else . Do n't believe salesmen who tell you the shoe will stretch . It should fit properly in the store at the time of purchase . Some women who can wear smaller sizes can get clothing bargains by buying their dresses , coats or sportswear in the Junior Miss Department . Remember , the waist line generally is higher in a Junior Miss . To be certain of fit , try on underwear , dresses , suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail order houses like Sears Roebuck , Montgomery Ward and J. C. Penney because of the size problem . They are afraid they 'll have the trouble of returning merchandise that does n't fit . Actually , the mail order houses are the one place where you can be sure all sizes are consistent . Their policy is to accept any garments you return on a money-back basis . You also are reimbursed for postage . Since this is an expensive operation , handling costs , plus postage , which is doubled in case of returns , these companies take special precautions to see that garments fit . Their catalogues tell you how to measure and // give explicit data on sizes . In addition , they require that all garments be made to specifications . Regardless of style and price , all size 34 women 's slips are identical in size . You wo n't find the cheaper ones cut a little skimpier . A further word about these specifications . They closely follow size standards suggested by the U.S. Bureau of Standards . Usually , sizes in children 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers do n't produce and most stores do n't carry enough items in standard sizes , but also because when children are growing , it 's difficult to gauge the exact amount of growth . You take a great risk when you buy unreturnable children 's garments on sale unless the child is with you to try on the clothing . The High Cost of Shrinkage and Fading Ever buy a dress or skirt that shrank with the first cleaning ? You can be fairly sure there wo n't be shrinkage if you read the labels and ask questions of the salesgirl , or better yet , the buyer . Many salesgirls know little about shrinkage , colorfastness or other such matters that are important to you if you want the best return on your clothing $$$$$ . Speak to the buyer or person in charge . She should know about fading and shrinkage . Her word is as good as a guarantee and if you have trouble , a reliable store will take care of you . If the label says , " Fabric shrinkage not more than 1% , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrinkage . I 'm not certain what is meant when the label says " Shrinkage control " or " Shrink resistant . " If the label says " Sanforized , " shrinkage is limited to a safe 1% maximum . If a garment is " Pre-shrunk " maximum shrinkage is 3% . If not treated , some synthetics and some woven cottons , like percale , can shrink up to 10% . That 's why it 's so important to check the label or the salesperson . If you // get no guarantee of maximum shrinkage , you may be wast ing money . A garment that shrinks 5% usually wo n't fit . Shrinkage in children 's clothes costs $$$$$ . It 's worse with children 's things than adults ' because if the shrinkage is n't too bad , in some cases an adult can made-do . But with grow ing boys and girls , you not only must have the right size , you ca n't afford to lose inches in the laundry . In addition to shrinkage , fading can cost $$$$$ . Faded clothes look dingy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded garments . And this is an answer for old clothes . But , who wants a faded or discolored new dress ? And , how do you restore the colors of a floral print ? Ever wash a dress and have the trimming run on the rest of the fabric ? The only way to prevent this is to read the label to make certain trim , thread , material and every decoration is colorfast . If there is no label ? or if it does n't cover color-fastness of trim as well as fabric , speak to the buyer . Look for labels that say " Vat Dyed . " The fabric will hold its color in sunlight , and after laundering or dry cleaning . " Sunfast " is next best . " Sunfast " drapes for example should have practically no fading due to sun exposure . " Sun Re sistant " usually means there may be slight but not excessive fading . Do n't take for granted you know what the terms on a label mean . Honestly , now , did you know there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resistant ? " If you had seen " Sun Resistant " on a label , would n't you have thought it meant no fading in the sun ? Water Water Everywhere Rain as well as sun can be a problem when it comes to clothing . Water repellent means the fabric has been treated to shed water . Waterproof fabric usually is coated with CUT YOUR CLOTHING COSTS plastic or rubber . It feels hot and sticky and is impervious to both water and air . In the old days , babies wore rubber , waterproof panties over their diapers . Many suffered from diaper rash because no air circulated . Today , far more baby panties are made of cotton , rayon , silk , nylon or a mixture , treated to make it resistant to water , but to permit air to flow through . Consequently , they are more comfortable . All garments treated to shed water do not have the same efficiency . Not only are the chemicals a factor , but closeness of weave and fabric absorbency are important . Some finishes come out in laundering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time by the dry cleaner . If you want permanent protection from rain , stains , etc. , read the label carefully . If it does n't give adequate information , ask the clerk . Do n't pay extra for something that will be washed away after a few launderings . Today many fabrics are treated with special finishes that may change their appearance , or impart special qualities . In addition to water resistant finishes , there are finishes that make " permanent " pleating possible ; that provide wrinkleresistant qualities ; that are stain and even oil resistant ; that give trousers a permanent sharp crease . Many of these finishes are a boon to the housewife . " Scotch Guard " is a treatment that repels stains and fluids . They practically stay on top of the fabric and can be removed with a tissue or piece of cloth . Some " permanent finishes , " however , are n't as permanent as the manufacturer would like you to believe . They come out after several cleanings . One of my neighbors recently bought an expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt . It still looks good , but after the first time in the water , the permanent pleats came out permanently . // Do You Suffer from Wash Day Headaches ? Ever iron a cotton dress with lace trim and find the dress ironed beautifully , but the lace shriveled and practically disappeared ? The lace was either nylon or rayon . Neither of these can stand the high heat required to iron cotton . For a dress like this you need ironing as well as washing or dry cleaning information . Otherwise , you 're literally burning up your $$$$$ . In addition to wearability , consider whether garments you are thinking of buying will require extra money or labor to keep them clean . Check all children 's garments , your dresses ? for that matter , everything ? to see whether they can be laundered at home or require dry cleaning . The latter adds to the overall cost of clothing . The former means work at home . Those who prefer to spend time on other things will . find drip-dry clothing , even if some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starching and ironing ? and cheaper than dry cleaning . Most , but not all , manufacturers are doing an ever improving job of supplying explicit instructions on whether to dry clean or launder and exactly how to go about it . Washday headaches are caused by the fact that so many garments are composed of a variety of combinations of fibers and have been treated in so many ways that washing and ironing instructions vary greatly . Most housewives ca n't possibly remember the printed directions that came with each garment ! Do you read the labels and throw them away ? Then when washday comes , do you just sort the white from the colored clothes and launder ? Ever had any shrink , lose shape , deteriorate , pill excessively , lose their " starch " or start to weaken ? If so , there 's a good likelihood that this was your own fault ! // To give you an indication of the complexities of laundering children 's everyday clothing , I am listing instructions collected from a few clothing labels in the children 's department in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton poplin jacket with flannel lining , the manufacturer says : " When washing and drying , turn jacket inside-out , wash separately , do n't boil or use bleaching compound .

Is it any wonder you have troubles with the laundry or that things do n't wear as they should ? You ca n't blame the manufacturer for poor service if you do n't follow his written instructions , yet it 's impossible to remember all the instructions . Manufacturers should help make it easier for the housewifeby putting permanent labels on every garment . This would reduce headaches at home and returns to the stores . It would increase wearability and satisfaction , and make it possible for you to save on your clothing $$$$$ because garments would hold up better . Until this is done , the only thing you can do to protect your $$$$$ by making clothes last longer by proper washing and ironing is to save labels containing laundering instructions . Paste or staple them in a spiral notebook or reserve some 3 x 5 cards or pages in the book for each member of the family . Next to each label write a description of the garment . Know Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fur collar on your winter coat , or you 're in the market for a fur stole , fur jacket or coat , do n't look for big bargains ! A former official of the Federal Trade Commission warned CUT YOUR CLOTHING COSTS at a Conference on Public Deception , " consumers should be wary of claims that prices are extremely reduced . " " It just does n't make sense , " he continued , " to advertise a mink coat reduced from $5,000 to $1,500 . Merchants just simply do not sell an article of a $5,000 value for $1,500 . Fur advertisements which claim they are selling below cost or below wholesale are not true in the majority of cases , " he concluded . This does n't mean you never can get a bargain . It does mean an excessive reduction may be phony . You can guard against being taken in by making your purchase at a reliable store with a reputation for standing behind its merchandise . A friend of mine bought a bargain fur coat . In less than a week , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repaired the sleeve , but kept her waiting three weeks for her coat as it was the busy season . She had worn the coat four times when the second sleeve started to come out and one of the skins in the seat split . The store refused to do anything for her . One repair job was enough ! She finally went to the Better Business Bureau and by spring the coat was repaired again . However , the skins kept splitting . She had a lemon . A reputable furrier either would not have carried such inferior merchandise , or would have made any necessary repairs to her satisfaction . You are protected from mislabeling by the Fur Products Labeling Act which requires that all furs be labeled correctly . The label must state the true English name of the animal that produced the fur and the country of origin of imported skins . It also will not only declare whether the fur has been dyed , damaged , used , or is second hand , but also whether it consists of paws , tails or bellies , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the label does n't say whether the fur is fragile , the workmanship good , or the skins well matched . If you look carefully , there are some things you can see for yourself about // quality of fur . Good fur has uniform coloring and texture , with no stiffness either in hair or leather . There should be no bare or " thin " areas and the skin should be soft but strong . Check parts of a coat not readily visible to the eye like under the arms , cuffs , collars , and the lapover on the left side front to make certain skins in these areas are of the same quality as the rest of the garment . Because so many technicalities are involved , the best way to insure getting good quality is to buy from a furrier or store with a reputation for honesty and responsibility . Decide in advance how much you can or want to spend and try on various garments with the qualities and styles you want in. that price range . Then you can be sure your fur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short and dumpy , and that the color is becoming . Examine your selection as carefully as possible . Some stores give a written guarantee stating the name of the fur and other pertinent information such as whether the skins are dyed , let-out and the price . If the furrier does n't give such a guarantee ask for and save a receipt with the important facts and keep the labels . If you 're buying on time , have the carrying charges written on the receipt so there is no misunderstanding . Some furriers guarantee free service if rips or tears occur the first season . Some are reluctant to admit the possibility of a rip occurring . Ask your store whether it will provide this kind of service and if so have it in writing to avoid future misunderstandings . Rips or tears can develop in good skins if they are under strain . For this reason , there should be plenty of room across the shoulders and under the arms of a coat or jacket , particularly if you intend wearing it while driving .

Then select a fur that will give you the qualities you want at a price you can afford . Here is a list of the most popular furs with their price ranges and insulating qualities : // Be cautious when you buy furs . They are probably the largest single expenditure for clothing you will ever make . Good furs properly cared for can last for many years .

Even women who will stuff themselves into undergarments that squeeze and distort their bodies are sensible enough not to buy a girl panties that bind , cut or cause discomfort when she sits down or bends .

For example , some foot disorders ( caused by cramping ) with their attendant pain and expense , can be avoided if you check shoes and socks periodically . Shoes and socks that fit perfectly in May and still are in perfect condition in September , may be pinching the toes and should be discarded . When you buy children 's clothing , select sizes large enough to permit growth but not so large as to be uncomfortable . Socks that are too large can be as uncomfortable as those that are too small . Before school opens , a child 's clothing should be tried on and anything tight should either be let-out or discarded . It 's a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because a child has outgrown it . Many large families hand clothes down from one child to another . Infants are too young to react , and some youngsters feel proud and grown-up wearing their older brother 's or sister 's hand-medowns . Others yearn for something new of their own . CUT YOUR CLOTHING COSTS Manufacturers are designing garments that " grow " with the child for longer wear . Look for clothes with " grow " features when you shop . They will save you money and keep your child comfortable . Many knit and terry cloth garments of stretch cotton or synthetics will fit an infant from birth through the first year or longer . You can cut costs by purchasing stretch sleepers , two piece play suits and rompers that will expand from birthsize to 21/2 years . When you buy rompers , suits or any garments with snaps at the crotch , look for models with two sets of snaps , which will give you an extra inch or two when the second set of snaps is used . A most practical , money-saving sleeper for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " barrel bottom " and an inner tuck . When you need extra length and width , you snip a thread and get not only extra inches from top to bottom , but the " barrel bottom " provides extra width . This is a real money saver . You can also purchase infant 's sleeping bags that have this kind of snip thread construction . Sun suits and bib-type long creepers are available with straps to add length as your toddler adds inches . You economize when you select clothes with add-a-year features . Many wool , cotton and synthetic coats , dresses and suits can be made larger by pulling out or snipping a thread in the sleeves and in skirt hems or pants . Some sleeves have tucks that let out . The garments I 've seen are very well styled and are tagged by the manufacturers with complete , easy-to-follow directions . One thing you should check before buying is the colorfastness of the garment . Remember that letting out the sleeves and hem in a blue coat is n't going to increase its wearability , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first season that the let-out area is a different shade of // blue . I saw one tag suggesting that the hem be lengthened before dry cleaning to avoid a possible line . You can buy little girls ' slips that let out by snipping a thread at the waist or lengthen by releasing tucks to give extra length . They come in both straight and bouffant styles . The stitching in these " growable " clothes is so cleverly done that it will not rip from ordinary wear or laundering . One of the oldest ways of getting extra use from skirts and dresses is to select those with deep hems . In the past , boys ' trousers were a problem . Now , you can find school boys ' slacks with self-lengthening cuffs . When you want those extra inches , you merely snip a thread at the cuff . For cold weather outdoor wear , you can find warm , pilelined jackets with let-out hems and sleeves . Snow pants for youngsters grow inches when you pull out a thread at the waist and let out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspenders . Grow features mean extra wear , lower clothing replacement costs and lower transportation costs since they cut down on frequent shopping . Look around , you can find grow clothes in all price ranges . As time goes on , manufacturers undoubtedly will develop even more ingenious designs that will reduce the high cost of replacing your children 's outgrown clothing and help you save $$$$$ . When you select your children 's clothes , you look for a good buy and for things that are attractive , but there 's another feature that many mothers do n't consider that can make life easier for both mother and child . Remember to look for garments designed to make it easier for the child to dress himself and become independent . A few years ago , some manufacturers labeled their garments " self-help . " I have n't seen any with these labels lately , but I have seen garments with self-help features . Clothes with front zipper fastenings are easy for a child to handle . You can get blanket sleepers // with front zippers . Look for zip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits , winter and cool weather jackets . Ski pants with a zipper down the front permit a young child either to step into them or to sit on the floor and pull them on . Dresses that button down the back or side , or with tiny buttons in front , are difficult for a little girl to handle . Select dresses with large , attractive buttons down the front . Cotton or synthetic knit outer sports shirts for boys or girls can be obtained with collars and a zipper front closing . Two piece outfits for boys and girls with elastic in skirt or shorts can be stepped into without your help . Although self-help garments do n't directly save money , they are no more expensive than similar garments without these features . They 'll give you a little leisure and your children a feeling of satisfaction and independence . Putting ski pants on three children , as I did when mine were little , used to make me yearn for warm weather . Sometimes when you 're shopping for the family ask yourself , " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clothes Before you even consider the relative advantages of homemade clothes , you should analyze your own temperament . If you find sewing a pleasure , that 's one thing ! But if it makes you nervous and tense , that 's something else entirely . In the long run , ready-made clothes cost a lot less than doctors or tranquilizers . Maybe you 're one of those people who just does n't have the knack ! A friend of mine decided to make matching sisterand-brother coats for her little ones . She got her patterns , cut the fabric and started sewing , carefully matching the pattern notches . Her only trouble was that she matched the wrong notches and wound up with something that did n't even // resemble a coat ! After several tries she finally gave up and hired a dressmaker ! Since then she has made only very simple things . If you 've done no real sewing recently think back to your school days and try to remember how you did in domestic science or home economics . Even if you were only a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't re-quire fine tailoring . I 'm a firm believer in " Sew and Save , " yet I can not do fine tailoring . Best way to start sewing at home is to rent a sewing ma-chine . You can get one for approximately $6.50 a month . At the end of the month you should know whether it willpay you to continue sewing and whether you want to buy a ma-chine . Before you decide to buy , check the " Tips on Sewing Machines " in the chapter on home appliances . The advantages of home sewing are tremendous . You can buy excellent patterns for any kind of garment , and you can find beautiful fabrics . When you select fabrics , try to get remnants or yardage that is on sale and be sure to obtain instructions for laundering . Make certain that both fabrics and trim are colorfast and wo n't shrink to excess . For lined garments , you now can buy two fabrics permanently bonded together . This means you do the entire job at once and need no additional lining . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home . You can make a girl 's washable corduroy jumper , size 8 , with 15/ yards of washable corduroy selling ( not on sale ) at 96 ? a yard . Add 500 for the pattern and 10 ? for the thread and the total cost runs around $2.25 . This jumper would sell for $4 to $5 readymade . The same jumper for summer in cotton at 29 ? to 59 ? a yard ( not on sale ) comes to approximately $1.10 to $1.25 . Readymade , it also retails at $4 to $5 . Party dresses for little girls can cost as much as 500% more than the same dress made at home . // It 's a question of whether you have the time and the temperament to sew . If you do , you 'll find that you can save by making your own drapes , curtains and other things for the home , as well as many kinds of clothing . You 'll not only save $$$$$ , you 'll get a sense of achievement , of having done something creative and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shop for Shoes Mothers have more trouble with children 's shoes than almost any other item of clothing . Some women complain their children " go through " shoes as though they were made of paper . Others complain that the kids outgrow their shoes before they wear them out . Both complaints relate directly to the money you spend on clothing . The important question is what you should look for in children 's shoes that will keep your child 's feet healthy and that you can purchase at a fair price . Is the answer the most expensive shoe or the cheapest ? Leather or synthetics ? You can save money at the outset by not buying any shoes for the infant until he can walk . My pediatrician told me that the Indians had excellent feet and could walk long distances without difficulty because they did n't wear shoes . I followed his advice and did n't put shoes on my children till they could walk . As a result , they do have excellent feet with no arch or other difficulties . I did not keep them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go barefoot till they could walk to help strengthen their feet and I saved $$$$$ at the same time . This is a matter to discuss with your doctor . However , one of the nation 's great department stores in Cleveland , does n't even carry shoes for young infants in its Children 's Shoe Department because it believes shoes are not good for infants before they can walk . The store does carry , in Infants ' Wear , // such items as booties for warmth and leather shoe-like covers made without last or support . More important than how long the shoe wears , is how i fits ! This is true for both children and adults . Since there is no standardization of sizes it is necessary to have shoes fitted each time . This is especially important for growing children Because even in dress shoes I do a lot of walking , I try to make shoe purchases at the end of the day when my feet are tired , sensitive and perhaps a little swollen . In the morning when my feet are rested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to wear with comfort later on in the day . To get the best fit , it is important to go to a reliable store with well-trained salesmen who are more interested in serv-ice than sales . In stores where the pressure to make sales is on , a clerk may even try to palm off shoes he knows do not fit properly . The child wearing such ill-fitted shoes may suffer permanent foot defects that not only can be painful as he grows up , but may even prevent him from taking a particular job or entering a profession that necessitates long periods of standing or walking . I know a young man who was deter-mined to be a dentist , but had to give it up , in spite of his excellent record at dental school , simply because he could n't bear to stand on his feet for such long periods of time . As a child , he always wore his brother 's outgrown shoes . When it comes to comfort , leather has a great advantage over synthetics . Plastics are " memory materials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they " remember " their original shape and go back to it . Leathers do n't ! This means that if the shoe upper is made of a synthetic and the last does n't exactly fit every part of the foot the shoe may stretch on wearing but it soon will " remember " its original shape and go back to it . Leather , on the other hand , has no " mem-ory , " and once stretched , remains stretched . This means that a shoe upper made of vinyl will hold its shape ? but at the // cost of not conforming exactly to the foot . I think it 's better to have a leather shoe that 's comfortable , than a synthetic that reverts to its original shape . This preference holds true in both adults ' and children 's shoes . Many synthetics wear longer and cost less than leather . Steel would wear better than plastics , yet no one in his right mind would suggest using steel for shoes . ( Except for industrial safety shoes which have a steelcap . ) Comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all synthetics have these disadvantages although the solid plastics appear to behave this way . Recently duPont introduced a high-cost synthetic , " Corfam , " for high-priced men 's ( approximately $30 ) and women 's ( approximately $20 ? $30 ) very beautiful shoes . " Corfam " has tremendous durability and looks like real leather . It has a honeycomb-like cellular structure that permits the shoe to " breathe " like leather , allowing perspiration and foot-heat to dissipate . Most plastics , on the other hand , keep moisture in . They also tend to be cold in winter , hot in summer . Stylists attempt to overcome this by making perforations in the uppers of plastic shoes . However , some styles ? blucher-type oxfords , for example ? lend themselves easily to perforations . These objections to plastics are more serious in uppers than in soles . Because synthetics are so tough , they do make longwearing soles and heels . Some brands are sold with a written guarantee stating that the composition soles are guaranteed to outwear the leather uppers . If they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensible shoes for youngsters , or anyone who insists on comfort , good fit and long wear , is a combination of leather uppers and composition soles and heels . Best price line in shoes for children is the medium . It does n't tend to last so long that the child outgrows the shoe , nor does it wear // through so fast that you 're constantly shelling out $$$$$ for new shoes . A shoe expert with whom I discussed this section does not entirely agree with me . He says on the controversial issue of plastics and middle priced vs. high priced children 's shoes : " You recommend leather uppers and composition soles and heels . Certainly composition soles wear well , however , leather does have many advantages , especially in children 's shoes . First , leather is less prone to puncture than synthetic soles . Second , sole leather also absorbs and breathes . This , I believe , is important because active children 's feet perspire a great deal and , of course , their shoes get wet in other ways . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The insole of a shoe with a synthetic sole may still be damp in the morning . Most children only own one pair of everyday shoes at a time so if their shoes do not dry overnight , they will be wearing damp shoes each day of the week . " Durability is extremely important in children 's shoes and this fact , in addition to the economies of production , has made synthetics a prime sole material . Leather , however , is the best sole material and is important enough that mothers would be better off economizing on some other part of the child 's wardrobe than on shoes . " " The Children 's Shoe Department in this department store has made the decision not to buy shoes made with synthetic ' uppers because the present materials used in children 's uppers have not proved successful , in our opinion , although tests are still being analyzed . " " When children are fitted , they generally get the best fit a shoe fitter has in stock . I am not suggesting that a shoe fitter would misfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoe does not conform as perfectly as a shoe can to a child 's foot ; the shoe fitter is not apt to tell the mother that his brand is not right for her child . " " I have not seen a low or medium priced shoe that con119 CUT YOUR CLOTHING COSTS forms to the majority of children 's feet as better shoes do . In addition , medium priced shoes do not usually have the high firm toe box that is a decided advantage in children 's shoes . A firm toe box not only protects the toes but is not as easily depressed and , therefore , less likely to impinge on a child 's toes . " If your child does outgrow his shoes while they 're still good , do n't save them for your younger child . The shoe that stretched to conform to the older child 's foot wo n't conform to the younger one 's foot , too . Even when the younger one 's foot becomes the same size as the shoe , that shoe just is n't for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important factor that many women would rather own a number of pairs of inexpensive shoes in a variety of styles than one pair of better shoes . If you are interested in variety and do n't mind shopping around , the low and medium priced lines are practical . Men generally prefer shoes that last and usually they are more sensible than women about the way their shoes fit . They also are n't confronted with too many styles to choose from . However , many men think they can judge the toughness of a leather sole by its thickness . Wearability of leather depends on its quality . A thick sole of inferior leather wo n't wear as well as a thinner sole of better quality . In the last few years , some unethical manufacturers have been substituting cheaper materials for leather and doing it so cleverly that the consumer has been deliberately misled . Some made the substitutions in order to maintain their price lines . This was particularly true in children 's shoes where parents tend to buy the same brand over and over . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her children for years . The shoes were good and prices fairly stable . After some time the shoes began to wear poorly . Why ? They looked the same ! Perhaps the manufacturer was substituting paper // for the innersole or cutting costs some other way in order not to raise prices . Some unethical retailers advertised all-leather shoes which , in fact , were not all leather . To protect you from this kind of dishonest merchandising , the U.S. Federal Trade Commission issued a Regulation requiring that leather substitutes be labeled . FTC spokesmen stated that the purpose of the Regulation is to prevent the consumer from being deceived by getting one kind of ma-terial when she wants something else . The Chairman of the FTC , Paul Rand Dixon stated at a shoe industry meeting that if the consumer , " . . . wants shoes made of zebra hide and asks and pays for shoes made out of zebra hide , then he should not be furnished with something made up to look like zebra that you or I might think is just as good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now appearing in the stores . Composition soles and heels are now imprinted with their true names . If linings , insoles or uppers are not leather , the identity of the material used is printed on the inside of the shoe . New catalogues from mail order houses clearly and explicitly describe the makeup of their offerings . In the old days , it was possible to buy calf that looked like alligator and be charged the price of alligator . That will no longer be possible . The Regulation will become increasingly important as better and more varieties o man-made materials become available for use in shoes . It will help protect your shoe $$$$$ . The Federal Government tries to protect you from misrepresentation by retail stores as well as by manufacturers . It has the authority to act when merchandise sold in interstate commerce has been misbranded or misadvertised . But , in the final analysis , you are in the best position to determine whether or not the stores where you shop are giving you the merchandise and the service that you have a right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Know Your Store ! If a store has a poor reputation , if you have been " burned " by a bad shopping experience or if you know someone who has , keep away from that store . An unethical storekeeper has all the time in the world to think up ways to fleece you . It 's something you simply ca n't beat , because you do n't have the time or experience to separate his good buys from his " lemons . " On the other hand , every store makes errors , if only because of the large number of items they sell and the many transactions handled in the routine of daily operation , the turnover of personnel and other difficult-to-control factors . A reputable store will give you an exchange or refund if you return merchandise for a legitimate reason within a reasonable period of time . TO SAVE $$$$$ TIPS ON LINGERIE 1 . If you want something that will wash easily and dry rapidly , select synthetics . Many do well in the automatic washer. 2 . For wear under transparent dresses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are especially proportioned for women of different build . If you 're short and wear a 38 , the garment is cut differently from a tall or average 38 . If you have a figure problem look for these slips , they cost no more and fit better . 4 . Examine seams to see that they are properly finished . 5 . Synthetic blends with " brushed " finishes are warm but light in weight , and the brushed finish gives a " feeling of warmth " and richness , even though it is n't expensive . Easy to launder in lounging and sleep wear . 6 . Wool robes may make you itch , require moth protection , and require dry cleaning which adds to overall cost . 7 . Robes of wool , combined with synthetics may be machine washable . Ask whether they 're moth-proof so you 'll know how to store in summer . // 8 . Knitted long panties can chafe if the seams are not made properly . Ask whether seams are guaranteed not to ravel. 9 . When buying knit panties , ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing have double layer of fabric at crotch , double seams and are bar-tacked at points of strain . 10 . Rayon panties dry slowly and tend to shrink from top to bottom rather than from side to side . Nylon doesn't. 11 . Some knit underwear shrinks , some gets out of shape . The width stretches ; the length shortens . Check this and whether it is non-allergic and moth-proof. 12 . Thermal underwear for men and women has a special knit that results in innumerable tiny pockets or cells to trap air and provide good insulation . The shirt I bought for ice skating was very warm , but heavy , and it shrank in laundering . 13 . When selecting a bra of a new brand , try it on before buying . If simple alterations are necessary , many stores will make them at no extra charge . 14 . Before buying a quilted duster or robe , examine the quilting . If it is diamond-shaped , make certain the threads do n't intersect each other . If they do , they may rip at points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores , bargain basements and women 's specialty stores . A nationwide women 's specialty store where I frequently get good buys has such tremendous buying power that many items are sold for less than similar items at department stores . They also can afford to sell for less because they do no advertising . 16 . Mail order houses have excellent buys . If you 're concerned about style and are afraid to buy slips or other lingerie by mail , you might try ordering panties . Their catalogues give complete descriptions and photographs of the merchandise that you can rely on . TO SAVE $$$$$ TIPS ON HOSIERY 1 . Proportioned stockings will fit better and last longer because the material is subjected to less strain . Stockings that are too tight in any part are under strain and run easily . CUT YOUR CLOTHING COSTS 2 . When you buy proportioned stockings , give the salesperson your full shoe size ? length and width . 3 . The Federal Trade Commission requires that manufacturers state the name of each fiber on their labels . For example : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! 4 . If your stockings tend to develop runs , try mesh . Run-resistant mesh stockings do run under strain , but not as badly as nonmesh hose . Run proof mesh hose usually wo n't run . But they develop small holes instead . 5 . If your feet perspire and you wear nylons , try those with cotton soles which absorb perspiration and feel more comfortable . 6 . The higher the denier , the heavier the stocking ; the lower the denier , the sheerer. 7 . Very sheer hose should be purchased with reinforced heels , particularly if you have rough , dry skin on your heels that can cause runs . 8 . If your legs are heavy at the top , it pays to spend more and get stockings with extra stretch at the top . Tops of all hose should have a run-stopping band to prevent garter runs from going wild . TO SAVE $$$$$ TIPS ON MEN 'S AND BOYS ' SHIRTS 1 . Examine inside of pockets for raw edges that may ravel . Pockets should have reinforcing at edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable . A 151/2 ( neck ) and 32 ( sleeve ) in one brand almost always will be cut along the same dimensions as other brands . 3 . Be sure shirt is sanforized or guaranteed to shrink no more than 1% . It 's preferable if the shirt has a label guaranty against shrinkage . 4 . A few salespeople know the threadcount of their shirts . Medium quality broadcloth has 136 warp threads by 60 filling threads per inch . Lower thread counts wo n't wear well . Good quality is 144 by 76 threads per inch . 5 . Shirts with two-piece sleeves cost less but wear as well as onepiece sleeves . // 6 . Stitches should be short and straight . 7 . Wash and wear fabrics are made of various fibers or combinations of fibers and have different qualities . Do n't expect all wash and wear clothes to behave in the same way . 8 . If wash and wear shirts become grimy at the collarband , cuffs , or under the arms , send them to a commercial laundry one time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 9 . Cotton fabrics treated with special finishes to make them wash and wear usually do n't wear as well as polyester cotton and Dacron , or all Dacron . They frequently require more ironing than other types , but are more absorbent and more opaque . 10 . Polyester and Dacron shirts wear well and usually have better resistance to wrinkling than all-cotton shirts . 11 . As new fiber blends and new finishes become available , there will be many unexpected improvements in shirts . Try one though before you stock up . Consider transparency , whether the shirt requires much ironing , and how it wears. 12 . Some new cotton and synthetic blends have built-in stretch ability that prevents binding . These are in the medium price lines . 13 . Turn frayed cuffs , or have the laundry do it . If that 's impossible , make short sleeves by cutting and hemming . TO SAVE $$$$$ TIPS ON LADIES ' DRESSES 1 . Size Try everything on , even though you may be a " perfect " + size 12 . Patterns , sizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manufacturer . It 's especially important to try on inexpensive summer dresses . Anything even slightly tight should be rejected ; it may not fit at all after being cleaned . 2 . The Fit After checking to see how you look , bend , sit , raise arms , pull shoulders back and forward as far as possible to check on roominess , particularly of armholes and sleeves , if you do n't want them to pull out . 3 . Durability Some buttons melt . Ask about cleanability . Also colorfastness of fabric and trimmings . Test zipper . Loose weave // or knit fabrics do n't hold their shape or wear as well as tight weaves . 4 . The Shape Lined garments hold their shape . Newer fabrics have bonded linings . Dresses made from them should cost less than a similar dress with a separate lining because of the lower workmanship costs . Ask for cleaning instructions of these new bonded fabrics . 5 . Style Select something that you know looks good and that your husband will like . Remember , it means nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her ! If the dress buttons from top to bottom , make certain there 's enough overlap . 6 . Workmanship A dress will last longer if the stitching holds up . Even if the salesperson thinks you 're a screwball , turn the dress inside out . Stitches should be small , seams smooth , not puckered , and wide enough so stitching wo n't pull out , edges of fabrics at seams should not be ravelling . Cheaply sewn dresses have pinked seams . It 's a sign of good workmanship when material on both sides of seams is turned and finished to prevent ravelling . Examine prints and stripes to see that pieces match . Closely and neatly stitched buttonholes are a sign of good workmanship . Loosely stitched buttonholes will pull out . Facings for neck or armholes on sleeveless dresses should be generous , lie flat with no puckers at the seam . 7 . Materials Examine labels for fiber content and cleaning instructions . Do n't select fragile material if you want a longwearing garment . Cloth belts made by stitching dress material over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or washed . Check to see that no buttons or trim are missing . If buttons are very unusual and dress is expensive , ask buyer to obtain one or two extra buttons from the manufacturer , unless extras have already been provided with the garment . TO SAVE $$$$$ TIPS ON MEN 'S SUITS AND OVERCOATS 1 . Suitability Select fabrics suitable for your local climate and for your own activities . If the suit is for business and you have a sedentary job , do n't select material that takes a shine . // Some of the new fabrics have built in stretchability that is particularly practical for a man of action . Light weights and looser weaves are cooler in warm weather . 2 . The Fit If possible , have someone go with you when you purchase a suit . He can tell you how the shoulders , sleeves and back fit . Test trousers by sitting and bending . Raise arms and bend elbows to see how sleeves fit and whether coat binds across chest . A tight garment will wear ? or tear . 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synthetics and blends is appearing on the market , read the fiber content on the label . Ask the clerk whether the trousers will hold their crease , whether the coat is wrinkleproof. 4 . Finishes Some manufacturers claim their fabrics have been treated to make them moth-proof and stain repellent for the life of the garment . Many fabrics are treated with Scotch Guard to make them stain and water repellent . This is particularly true of topcoats. 5 . Tailoring Custom tailored suits are the most expensive , and ' should fit and look the best . Ready made suits may not fit as well , but if the same fabric is used , they 'll wear equally . A good-looking and proper-fitting custom made suit depends on having a good tailor . A poor tailor 's suits may be no better than one off the rack , and will cost more $$$$$ . Seams at shoulders and armholes should be smooth ; puckering is a sign of poor tailoring . 6 . Trousers Should require very little alteration . Adjusting the . length should be enough . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's better to get a larger size and have them taken in , rather than a smaller size and have them let out . Ask if the waistband is of non-roll fabric . 7 . Workmanship Stitches should be small and close together . Seams should be taped , piped or felled . Underseams should be pressed flat . Garments should be reinforced at strainpoints . Linings should be firmly sewed in . Should not bulge . Pockets should be double stitched with small stitches . Durable pocket fabric is closely woven . More expensive suits have hand sewed buttonholes . Machine stitching should be tight // with small stitches . Check to see that all pieces have been matched so that the pattern does n't look like a patch work quilt . This is especially important with plaids. 8 . Well made overcoats have buttons secured with small buttons on the inside . Lining should be full length even when it is of light weight fabric , since the added length helps the garment keep its shape . 9 . Coats with zip-in innerlinings can be used both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woolen tweeds and save $$$$$ since one coat does the job of two . TO SAVE $$$$$ TIPS ON SHOES 1 . To increase the life of thin-soled women 's dress shoes , have them half-soled almost immediately after buying them . This also helps shoes keep their shape . Also , have metal tips put on the tip of the sole . These may seem like unnecessary expenses but they will pay dividends in the long run . 2 . Sneakers can be put in the washing machine , but they may shrink despite what the salesman tells you . Mine did . 3 . The U.S. Department of Health , Education and Welfare says in its booklet , " Your Children 's Feet and Footwear , " that before he starts walking , a baby really does n't need any covering for his feet ? except , possibly , to keep him warm in cold weather . In warm weather he 'll fare better if his feet are uncovered . If you insist on some kind of covering , select socks or shoes that do n't bind and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper fit , try on both shoes as one foot frequently is larger than the other . 5 . A Government booklet on shoe fitting and sizing says , " 70% of the population has mild or serious trouble with their feet . Deformities and blemishes , such as distorted toes , bunions , corns , callouses , ingrowing and thickened nails , lumps over the heel tendon , and shortened calf muscles , often are attributable to continuous wearing of shoes that were too tight , too short or too high heeled . " To prevent pain and unneces$$$ // sary expense later on , have your children 's shoes properly fitted . This applies to the entire family . 6 . Years ago , shoes with cemented soles were considered poor buys . Because of developments in new adhesives , good quality shoes can be " cemented " rather than sewed and the leather itself will tear apart before the " cemented " surfaces separate . 7 . To make shoes last longer , protect them from perspiration by wearing stockings , socks , footlets or other covering between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brittle . Stuff them with paper , dry away from heat and rub leather soles and uppers while wet with castor or similar oil to restore softness . 9 . Now that shoes must be labeled , you can tell whether the insoles are made of paper . If so , the shoes are likely to lose shape early and look shabby . A good quality insole will help make a shoe wear and hold its shape longer . TO SAVE $$$$$ TIPS ON INFANTS ' CLOTHES 1 . Fancy dresses and suits for a newborn infant are a useless expenditure . You probably will receive some of these from friends or relatives . If you receive several , exchange them for the toddler size or for play suits that the baby will need when he 's older . 2 . Gauze diapers are more absorbent and dry more quickly than Birdseye . To save , buy irregulars , or seconds , from your department store 's basement . Most stores get them only once or twice a year .

The housewife is flabbergasted by the variety , confused by the problem of wearability and washability , and bewildered by the number of new brand names greeting her every time she shops . To give sensible advice on how to select fabrics made from the fabulous new man-made fibers is extremely difficult because there are so many on the market and so many more about to be born in test tubes and laboratories . Many women think of fabric in terms of Nylon , Dacron , acetates , wool , cotton , and sometimes silk . This is unrealistic . The truth is , the number of new fabrics , fibers , and blends of fibers is extremely large . Last Sunday , I diligently went through the advertisements in The New York Times for men 's , women 's and children 's garments , nothing else . I bypassed draperies , furniture , rugs , pocketbooks , and household " linens . " There were seventy different fabrics described 131 // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with new fibers and fabrics constantly being developed in great research laboratories here and abroad . New fiber combinations ! New brand names ! New finishes ! That 's why it 's extremely difficult to write adequately about this changing world of synthetics . As they prove themselves , the newest fabrics will be marketed and some older ones buried . The latest fabrics have qualities of beauty , wearability and cleanability , and innovations in finishes will give old and new fabrics better characteristics than they formerly offered . Information and investigation can become obsolete so quickly that I 'm going to limit myself to generalizations applicable today and , I hope , tomorrow . What Are Man-Made Fibers ? Man-made fibers ( short strands ) and man-made filaments ( long continuous strands ) are made from chemicals . They are spun or twisted to form yarn from which fabrics are woven or knitted . They are man-made as opposed to such natural fibers as wool , cotton , silk , or flax ( linen ) . The most common man-made fibers are : Nylon , a fiber and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very strong and lightweight , has high abrasion resistance , but ca n't stand strong sunlight . Nylon is nit damaged by water or perspiration , washes and dries easily and blends with other fibers . Excellent in sweaters and other knitwear ( though it may pill ) , hosiery , upholstery , summer suits and even work clothes . Also used in parachutes and tires because of its strength . Rayon and Acetate ( both with a cellulose base ) trademarked Acele , Celanese , Estron , etc. , can be made to look like wool , cotton , silk , satin , linen , and fur . Rayon is not as strong as Nylon , becomes weaker when wet , resists sunlight , dyes beautifully , and if dyed with good dyes is colorfast in // both sun and laundry . Special finishes can make it absorbent , and crease resistant , and give it added strength . Garments made of rayon should have wide seams to prevent slippage and/or pulling . Acetate fabrics have become more popular than rayons . Both acetate and rayon fibers can be blended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or in blends they are used in underwear for girls and women , dresses , sports and evening wear , bedspreads , draperies and upholstery . Arnel triacetate differs from acetate in that it has better wrinkle resistance , ease of care , high resistance to heat and can be creased permanently . Polyester Fibers are used in Dacron , Fortrel , and Kodel . They blend with cotton , rayon and worsteds and are either " straight " or in blends in " wash-n-wear " shirts , men 's and boys ' underwear , worsted suits , women 's and girls ' dresses , sleepwear , interlinings and rainwear . They are the fibers that really made possible today 's permanent pleats in blends with rayon or acetates . Except for Kodel , some polyester fabrics tend to pill . All " wash-n-wear " beautifully , are colorfast , hold permanent pleats and creases and are wrinkle-resistant . Polyester fiberfill is used to fill quilted outer jackets , pillows , comforters , upholstery and even mattresses . Acrylic Fibers are typefied by Orlon , Creslan and Acrilan . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are colorfast , washable , and hold creases . In knits they tend to pill and are not as strong as Nylon . They blend well with other fibers and are used in blankets , sweaters , carpets , men 's and women 's garments . Glass Fibers are used in Fiberglas , a strong , washable , colorfast , quick-drying material that neither stretches nor shrinks . It makes excellent curtains and draperies and now is being used in bedspreads . Spandex ( polyurethane base ) is a stretch fiber which produces stretchable fabrics . Some trade names are Lycra or // Vyrene . It 's used in foundation garments , stretch straps in women 's bras and slips ; it will soon appear combined with other fibers to give stretch qualities to older fabrics . Undoubtedly , many new fabrics will be appearing on the market . As long ago as 1960 , one producer alone , American Viscose Company , already was working on 109 different synthetic fibers . New Ways with Fibers Fabrics with new qualities are made by blending two or more fibers into yarns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nylon ) for suits or skirts ; Nylon and spandex for stretchy lace slip tops ; or 65% Dacron and 35% cotton for practical men 's " wash-n-wear " shirts . In blends , the cloth takes on the characteristics of the dominant fiber . The new fabrics are a great boon to consumers who , however , frequently find them difficult to select , particularly if labels do n't give much information . Shopping problems become more complicated because all kinds of new finishes are being developed and superimposed on the fabrics . For example , rayon and cotton will produce a different fabric from rayon and Dacron . If finished with a water repellent , still a third type of fabric emerges . Sound much like the rayon of ten years ago ? An old friend of mine bought rayon years ago and detested it . She still does and wo n't buy it . She 's missing out ! Her image of rayon is out of focus . Today 's rayons marketed with names like Fortrel and Arnel have been engineered and adapted to resist wrinkles , withstand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as high soft nap blankets , sheer curtains , wrinkle free jersey suits , even snowy white sharkskin sportswear . To get the best for your $$$$$ it 's imperative that you read the labels to know what you 're buying and how to care for // it . Recently I wanted an inexpensive dress and not a single one was labeled or tagged . Result ? I did n't buy anything . Nothing is a bargain if you do n't know what you 're buying and do n't know how to take care of it . Too few garments have adequate informative labels . Actually , I 'm trying to hold off on a number of purchases until some of the new stretch fabrics appear on the market . And I 'm not talking about stretch pants ! I 'm not the type ! A seemingly practical development in clothing which I am anxious to test soon will be on the market in the form of stretch garments of several kinds . Is your husband like mine ? Does he want to unfasten the top of his trousers after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a skirt for the same reason ? New stretch will be added to older fabrics so they can expand a couple of sizes under pressure . Your husband 's trousers and underwear , even the neckband of his shrits , will be comfortable under all conditions requiring stretching . If you put on a few pounds your slips will stretch to fit . When you drive the car or swing a golf club , your clothes will stretch with you . Such products are just around the corner . Other developments are coming through the use of electronics which is starting to change the fabric industry as much as chemistry did 15 years ago . It 's about to produce quality controlled fabrics . Electronic color control is making it possible not only to reproduce the same color over and over but exactly to match a color in every type of fabric . This means you will be able to purchase a woolen skirt of a particular shade and buy an acetate blouse and a woolen coat in the identical color . It 's a big change from the days when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks after you purchased one . Remember when you had to buy all the yarn you needed at once when you were knitting a sweater ? That 's still true in many stores where yarn from a new batch // may not match the lot ahead of it . This will soon be a thing of the past with electronic color-control . Flawless fabrics made to rigid specifications will also be possible through electronics . If a dress company orders fabric with 80 threads per inch in the warp , electronic " monitors " will scan the fabric while it 's being loomed and the slightest variation will be automatically corrected , instantly . In addition to the new fabrics , watch for the new finishes . Many women have become somewhat disenchanted with " wash-n-wear " fabrics because of extravagant claims made for them when they were first introduced . However , research on new finishes is being conducted constantly . Lycra is a huge plus in " wash-n-wear . " It has a terrific " memory " ? will stay creased or dramatically fresh depending on the treatment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being baked in , in huge ovens . Smooth fabrics that manufacturers claim wo n't wilt or rumple , are about to appear on the market . That means your clothes will still look fresh even after a hard day 's work in the heat , if these claims prove justified . How can you spend your clothing dollar wisely in this fast changing situation ? By checking the label or getting the information from a qualified sales person , and carefully following directions . I have gotten so that I will not buy a garment without knowing what it 's made of because it 's too easy to gel fooled . I once purchased a blue , two-piece knit suit from a shop in Akron , Ohio . The garment had no label , but the store 's buyer told me the suit was all cotton , which was exactly what I wanted . Two months later , at a store in New York , I saw the identical suit in burnt orange and decided to buy it . Again , no label , but this time I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it make ? Big difference in summer storage . No problems with the cotton . Moth problems with // the wool . Big difference in cleaning , too . The cotton was washable , the wool not ! Your Protection Is Weak ! The Textile Fiber Products Identification Act and the Wool Products Labeling Act attempt to protect you by stating that fabrics must carry labels giving their family or generic name and if the fabric is composed of more than one fiber , every fiber that constitutes more than 5% of the fabric must be listed . That 's why you see on men 's drip dry shirts , 65% Dacron , 35% combed cotton . These labels help you identify what you 're getting so you do not overpay . A shantung dress made of all silk will be expensive . But if the shantung is made of Dacron , it should be much cheaper . The material probably costs around $2.00 a yard , retail . If it were made of 77% Dacron and 23% cotton , it should be still cheaper because the fabric sells for approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not as good as the all silk . It is different . It wrinkles less , but it does n't have the same tradition of elegance as silk . What 's wrong with the Textile Identification Act is that it does n't tell you how a fabric will wear , whether it 's being used for the right purpose , will hold up , or how to clean and care for it to get maximum usage and the best value for your $$$$$ . Some manufacturers give explicit and detailed information on their labels , but this is entirely voluntary . Some synthetic fabrics are shoddy , poorly made and badly finished . Some garments are unlabeled . Despite the law some retailers deliberately remove the tags . Excellent fibers may be woven or knitted into textiles of poor quality . Result ? A poor garment ! Excellent fabrics may be cut or sewn into poorly made garments . Result ? A poor garment ! Your best buy is a good fiber , a well processed fabric and a properly made // garment . Your best protection starts with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabrics of uniformly high quality . It is n't fiber that you purchase , it 's yard goods , or clothing . It is the finished or " end " product that concerns you . Will it wear or tear ? Will it fade or shrink ? Will the seams pull out ? Will a sweater pill ? Is it washable ? To maintain top quality and performance , some manufacturers of synthetic fibers control both the fabric and garment manufacturers who use their fibers . One company with a tight control program is the Celanese Corporation of America . It will not permit a piece of Fortrel brand or Arnel brand fabric or a garment of these materials to bear the Fortrel or Arnel tags unless it has undergone a rigid qualitycontrol program . Fabric samples are tested repeatedly for light fastness ; washfastness ( shade changing and staining ) ; dimensional stability ( stretch and shrinkage ) ; seam strength yarn slippage ) ; tear strength ; tensile strength ; wash and wear ; wrinkle rating ; sublimation ( color transfer measurement ) ; solvent bleeding ( dry cleanability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance after repeated washing ; abrasion resistance ( flat abrasion ) ; appearance change due to abrasion ; edge wear and flex abrasion . After Celanese OK 's the fabric and it is sold to a clothing manufacturer , Celanese still will not issue the " Fortrel " or " Arnel " tags unless the fabric has been used for a suitable purpose . Fortrel ranges in looks from bulky tweed to dainty dimity . It is used in anything from a man 's suit to delicate curtains . The Fortrel curtain tag differs from one on a woman 's dress . In addition to the name of the fabric , the tag tells you how to care for the garment , has cleaning instructions including type of soap or detergent and temperature of wash water when necessary . The tag assures you the fabric has been pre-tested for performance and is being used in a quality supervised garment , curtain , or other end product . // Other fiber manufacturers similarly control the use of their brand names . Another good example is duPont which also exercises rigid controls from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a safe buy for your money is buy garments bearing the type of tag described above . Then you can be certain you 're getting a product that has been controlled and tested from fiber to garment . Some uncontrolled fabrics are made by mills that try to cut costs with poor dye jobs or sloppy finishing . The result may be fabrics or consumer goods that just wo n't hold up . In general , good man-made fibers have certain great advantages . They are non-allergic . Do n't attract moths . They are light weight , can be very warm , and can be dyed exquisite colors . Some are " drip-dry . " Some can be made to look like fur , or wool , and many are washable . Since new synthetics constantly are appearing on the market , the only way you can protect your $$$$$ and be certain of long wear is to find out how to keep them clean . The label should tell you . If it does n't , ask the buyer . If she does n't know , select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He uses different heats , etc. , for different synthetics . Tell him what the fabric consists of so he can do the best possible job . TO SAVE $$$$$ TIPS ON SYNTHETICS 1 . When white nylon underwear becomes yellowed or dingy , give it added life by dying it . 2 . Save labels with laundering instructions and follow them when washing and ironing . No sense in ruining a garment by using water or an iron that 's too hot , or by putting it in the dryer when the label says not to . 3 . If you are going to send your husband 's shirts to the laundry anyway , there 's no need to spend more for drip-dry fabrics . // 4 . If your husband travels extensively and will wash his own drip-dry clothing , or if you 're both taking that long-anticipated vacation , a few well chosen " wash-n-wear " shirts and articles of underwear for him will make your laundry problems disappear and will save $$$$$ in the long run . 5 . Some water repellent fabrics can be dry cleaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff as a board and useless . Be sure you know how they should be cleaned . 6 . Some drip-dry garments will yellow if a chlorine bleach is used . Check the garment label and if it says not to use chlorine , use either no bleach or a non-chlorine type bleach . 7 . Some bedroom slippers are lined with a fabric that has been treated to make it germ-proof . Inquire about this ; it 's a good buy . 8 . Some fabrics are colorfast to perspiration . Few labels mention this . If the fabric has n't been treated , you can protect your garments by spraying under the arms of the garment after every dry cleaning with Serene or a similar spray preparation that can be purchased in the notions section of your department store . 9 . Some fabrics lose their dye ( become crocked ) when you rub them . This often happens when you try to remove a stain , particularly from a garment that requires dry cleaning . Best thing to do is send the garment to the dry cleaners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had no tai and examination disclosed that the tag had been cut off ( by the retailer ? ) . The garment , which obviously should have been washable , faded so badly it actually changed color . If you buy such a garment , return it promptly . 11 . Because of its softness , Orlon is the poor man 's cashmere . In addition , it is washable , wears well , holds its shape and is n't affected by moths . 12 . If a water repellent garment has not been stitched with water repellent thread , it will leak at the needle holes . Check this point before you buy . CHAPTER V Do n't Go Bust on the Furnishings Are you a new bride just furnishing your first home ? Or are you about to re-do a room , or even your entire house ? Are you replacing a worn out or outmoded piece of furniture or rug ? Do you know where to buy ? What to look for ? What to avoid ? How to select specific items to save $$$$$ ? Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or do a room over , take plenty of time to think about it , then make a plan . Most families refurnish their homes three times during their lives , usually a room at a time . As the baby grows older , the crib goes out and child 's furniture goes in . As the children mature , or you move , your needs and tastes change , or your old furnishings deteriorate . The living room furniture is " shot " , springs in the sofa are gone , chairs scratched and in need of reupholstering , the dining room furniture is out of style . So you 're thinking of new furnishings . The question is : Are you thinking clearly ? Do you know what they will cost ? Drapes , carpeting , furniture , all have gone up , up , up ! So , before you go into the stores and fall in love with the beautiful new fabrics and styles , sit down with your husband 141 // and figure out exactly how much you can afford to spend . This is Rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a house or just replacing the carpeting . Then stay within your furnishing budget . You may find when you actually do start shopping that your preconceived ideas have no relation to reality . That prices are so high you ca n't afford what you want or even all you need . If you 're short on cash , buy the essentials and let such things as carpeting and drapes wait . If you absolutely must have a refrigerator and a sofa ? compromise . Buy a used refrigerator and a new sofa , or if you 're really tight for cash , buy a used sofa or even an inexpensive substitute . I started housekeeping with a foldaway cot disguised as a sofa . I made a good looking chintz spread and covered the thing with zillions of little homemade pillows . A few years later I bought a sofa and reserved the foldaway for overnight guests . Consider buying second hand furniture , if you need furnishings for a short time . If , for example , your husband is a construction worker who moves from job to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not permanently settled , or you 're starting on your first job away from home . You 'll be happily surprised at how much furniture you can get for very little money , particularly if you 're at all adept at fixing things . When my daughter went to Cal Tech for her doctors degree , she had a furniture problem . The school had no living facilities for girls . She 'd be there three years and wanted an apartment so she could save money by cooking in . What to do with almost no money ? She completely furnished a bedroom , living-dining room and kitchen on $65.00 and this included a gas stove and an electric refrigerator that worked but roared like a truck . Everything came from the Salvation Army and Good Will stores . She made her own simple curtains and slip-covered a cot with huge washable terrycloth beach towels . // Make a List Write out what you absolutely must have . For example , the minimum for my daughter would have been a spring and mattress , a chest of drawers , a bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove . Make a second list of everything you would like . If you 're doing more than one room , make similar lists for each . Take into consideration the size of the room and whether you are likely to move in a short time . Many experts believe that during the planning stage , you should make a drawing of the room sketching in windows , doors , etc . Then furniture should be scaled accordingly and you should have the entire arrangement planned . I think this is unrealistic because most women delight in moving furniture around , so the initial furniture arrangement will not be permanent . That 's why extra large pieces are n't as practical as those of regular size . They may fit in your present living room , but not in the next one , or not if you rearrange the furniture . After planning and making lists , if you 're in a new community , read the ads , check with relatives , friends and neighbors , to find the names of reliable stores . Now you 're ready to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop around and place a realistic cost next to each item . You may find you can afford only a few things at a time and will have to fill in as you get more money . Govern Your Taste by Your Purse You do n't need to buy antiques or expensive furnishings to have a home that is comfortable and reflects good taste and charm . You do need to know something about fabrics , color , style and furniture construction . You may ask what furniture construction has to do with charm ? and the answer is , " A great deal . " A poorly constructed chair that gets lumpy , // loses shape , sags , and has loose legs , soon adds anything but charm to a room . So , if you want something attractive and a good buy for your housefurnishing $$$$$ , you 'll have to bone up on a few of the more important things to look for in furniture and carpet construction . Let 's get one thing straight : there is no such thing as cheap furniture . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a home and a car , housefurnishings are probably the most expensive things you 'll ever buy . And if , as I suspect , you 're like me , the furniture must last longer than the auto-mobile . Impulsive decisions can be costly expenses that will ruin a room and wreck your dreams . One young friend of mine had scrimped along until she finally had saved $1,000 to spend on her living room . She carefully planned and allocated her money , but then she could n't resist a real " bargain , " in an Oriental rug for $750 . Out the window went the plan ! She was left with only $250 to spend for a sofa , easy chairs , lamps , occasional tables and drapes ! Obviously , regardless of her taste . The cost of the rug was out of proportion to her total available $$$$$ . Color Schemes Are Important There 's nothing more miserable than living in a room where the colors get on your nerves . And it 's easy to select colors that do n't quite go together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores or are using little swatches of fabric . The only way to prevent this is by deciding on a color scheme and sticking to it . It 's your home so build the color scheme around your coloring and personality . A blonde friend of mine uses turquoise and champagne to set off her lovely hair and complexion . No wonder she always looks elegant in a setting created just for her . But , face it ? if you have three little ones who play in the // living room , light colors are not for you . You 've got to be practical , particularly if you have children or affectionate pets who leap on the furniture . It 's sad , but most of us must compromise between esthetics and good buymanship . Usually we ca n't select what 's most practical and the best buy , and at the same time get what makes us happiest . We have to draw a line somewhere between the two . If you 're fortunate enough to live in the new suburbia or in a big , old roomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family room ( what grandma called the back parlor ) you can select practical colors and rugged materials for the parts of the house that get the hardest use . More delicate colors and fragile fabrics go where the traffic is low . In planning a color scheme , even if you do a room a few pieces at a time , consider all the furniture , rugs , drapes and even the color of the walls . The women 's magazines have beautiful illustrations of rooms that would usually be very expensive to duplicate but do n't worry , the color schemes they show you are basic and easy to copy . Dual Furniture Has Its Advantages Needless to say , bunk beds take up half the space of two and and cost less . A sofa-bed in an efficiency apartment may not be as comfortable as a Hollywood bed , but it 's better looking . If you 're on the market for one , test it before buying . See if it 's comfortable for both sitting and sleeping . I tried to sleep on one once that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and of me ! Dressing table-desks are the greatest ! And I speak from experience . I had one in a mahogany bedroom set and used it as a dressing table for 15 years . Then I moved . Now it 's a desk and to see it in my den you would never guess it once graced my bedroom . Dining room tables that accordion into practically nothing $$$ AND SENSE 14 &; are the designers ' gift to homes with small dining areas . They save $$$$$ ( in rent ) and space . Chests and tables that may be used for more than one purpose save furniture $$$$$ and space . An excellent example is. a chest of drawers that also can be used as a room divider . Unfinished wooden shelves for your youngsters ' toys can be repainted when he 's older and used as a bookcase . Or make a toy-bookcase with building bricks and planks from the lumber yard . I 'm still using the planks for garage shelving 25 years later . Get the Checkbook Out Before going into wise buying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best and cheapest way to pay for furnishings is on a 30 ? 60 days charge account with no interest . You pay as you go , yet have some time in which a flaw or defect can show up . If anything is wrong with the purchase , you 'll get prompt service or an exchange . I know this may be controversial , but I personally believe ( and everyone I know does , too ) that even the most reputable stores give you better service when you buy on a charge account . Even the most responsible retailer may deliver a piece of furniture that was n't examined carefully before it was . shipped . It may have a scratch or nick , a leg may be loose , or a flaw or even a stain may show up in the upholstery and it may be weeks before you notice it . I 've found that the retailer is usually anxious to keep you happy , at least until you 've paid your bill . Many families buy on credit or the installment plan because they 're low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you intend buying on credit make certain the load is n't more than you can carry . It 's no fun sitting on a love seat and having nine more payments to make , when you 're pregnant and ca n't afford another baby . // Compare interest rates at various stores to make sure you 're not overpaying for credit . It may be that the best bet is a loan from your bank . There are tips on credit buying in the chapter called " Shoppers ' Quicksand : Buy Now ? Pay Later . " Some stores specializing in selling on the installment plan have overpriced " borax furniture . " This is a term to describe shoddy , badly constructed , overpriced furniture . Best way to deal with a store like that is to stay away . When you 're concerned about the price , and who is n't , you may be tempted to buy " Tremendous Bargains " from irresponsible storekeepers . There are all kinds of gimmicks that add up to the customer getting fleeced . One unfair practice is the " Warehouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on borax furniture that wo n't hold up , price tag it with phony markups and phony markdowns , then advertise it as a " Warehouse Sale . " This does n't mean all warehouse sales are frauds . Some stores have " Warehouse Clearance Inventory Sales " with very legitimate markdowns . One of Washington 's largest department stores has such a sale once or twice a year and lots of people postpone buying until the sale . I 've gotten terrific bargains at them . The big problems with such a legitimate sale is that there are so many customers trying to grab things that you have little or no time to examine the furniture and learn anything about materials or construction . Too often then , you buy by price and the size of the markdown . Steer clear of $365 ? 3 Room Outfits ? specials advertised in Sunday supplements or in door-to-door flyers . You can spot them because they also promise easy credit or instant credit and usually throw in a stereo hi-fi or a vacuum cleaner for a dollar or offer some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a responsible department store . The furnishings which seem like a bargain are " borax " and overpriced at that . // If you 're buying used furniture , avoid deceptive ads run by secondhand stores . In some cities , operators of second-hand stores rent an apartment , stock it with used furniture , advertise in the want ads , pretend to be a family on the move , and offer it at outrageous prices . You generally can spot these ads . If you do make a mistake and land in the apartment , you can sense from its unlived in atmosphere that it 's a blind . Best bargains in used furniture are from people who actually are on the move . Some are going too far to ship their furniture profitably . Some are moving to smaller quar-ters . Whatever the reason , this is real distress merchandise and the owners are anxious to get rid of it at any cost . The secondhand dealer is in business to make a profit . Try to sell something to him and it 's not worth a plugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost priceless for the po-tential buyer . Good furniture frequently is spoiled by sec-ondhand dealers who will resort to a horrible varnish or paint job to cover a few scratches . I believe in playing safe . Stay out of hock and buy from a reputable store that will still be in business long after you have made your purchase and will stand back of their furni-ture for years if it 's been treated kindly . Upholstered Furniture Is a Problem A poorly constructed piece of furniture that ca n't stand wear and tear can look very attractive . In one January Sale , I saw some good looking love seats at $99 that the salesman assured me he would n't have in his own home . " It 's promo-tional stuff , brought in for the sale , " he told me . " It wo n't hold up . " I was visiting a " reputable " store in a large East-ern city . Not to buy ? just to talk furniture and examine the stock . I started looking for informational labels . There were // none . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " they 're not esthetic looking . " Actually , very little furniture comes la-beled , or if it does , many stores remove the labels . I checked numerous stores and did n't find much in my search for labels . We talked about brand names and the salesman told me that some people ask for specific brands that they 've seen ad-vertised . " But brand is n't a true guide to quality , " he said , " because some of the cheaper houses advertise as much or more than the quality manufacturers . " This is not strictly true . Yet , many stores remove the manufacturers ' labels and substitute their own . One salesman explained it this way , " We have to do it on our cheap furniture . " It 's difficult to learn much about quality merely by look-ing at an upholstered piece . You ca n't see the springs . You ca n't see the wooden framework . And , if you shop at night , you ca n't even get a true idea of the color . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted . Do n't ask me why ! To get any information , you must depend on the sales-men , many of whom know or care very little about construc-tion . They 're interested in making a sale . The store 's buyer knows about construction . But it 's difficult to get to him . Especially during a sale . There are some little things you can see . If the cushions on a couch do n't fit snugly , like pieces of a jig saw puzzle , it 's a sloppy fitting job and indicates sloppy workmanship and construction . Are the buttons tight ? Are untrimmed threads hanging in back of the cushions ? Is the welting crooked ? Does the upholstery fabric fit perfectly ? particu-larly under the arms and where the arms join the rest of the chair ? Even if the furniture looks attractive do n't buy if inspection shows that the workmanship is poor . If a chair or sofa passes the examination and comes within your price , test it by doing what comes naturally . Sit in it     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
