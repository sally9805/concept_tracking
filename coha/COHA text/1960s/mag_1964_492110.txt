A CRISIS FOR CAPITALISM T here will be a corning-out party at the Jockey Club next week , " said the society editor of a Bogota newspaper . " Eight hundred have been invited . She 's a lovely girl and she will wear a Dior gown . " The society editor sighed . " I 've already gotten eight letters of protest . A lot of people think such parties are immoral when there 's so much poverty and hunger in Colombia .

Colombia would be run a lot better than it is . " It was eight A.M. " They call me an oligarch . Well , I 'm here at the office every day by this time , earning a living .

" The industrialist spoke for a beleaguered breed , the Latin-American capitalist . He is not honored in his own country , and neither is his natural ally , Wall Street .

In corporate offices , whether the view out the window be Guanabara Bay or New York harbor , the mood is distinctly bearish . U.S. investment has virtually ceased , and Latin Americans have been sending scared money abroad at the rate of $800 million a year . In a widely quoted speech , President John T. Connor of Merck and Company , which operates pharmaceutical plants from Mexico to Argentina , declared that " in the midst of the current chaos in Latin America , the U.S. corporation is about as much at home as a bishop in a poker game .

As economic conditions gradually worsened . beginning with a sharp fall during the mid-1950 's of the commodity prices on which Latin America depends , the far left had great success in spreading the idea that private enterprise and American " imperialism " were to blame . As political harassment of free enterprise grew , its performance indeed slowed and capital began to flee , giving more weight to the leftist argument . The truly wrenching turn of the spiral , of course , was Cuba . To the Latin politician , the overriding point of the first successful Communist , anti-American revolution was clear . The time had conic for a tactical shift further to the left . To a Wall Street man , the Castro revolution was an equally epochal event , a sort of American Suez , shattering preconceptions and financial reputations . In Castro 's total take of about a billion dollars ' worth of U.S. property , these were just some of the losers : the American and Foreign Power Co. , $136 million in utilities ; the Cuban-American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mills and port facilities ; the American Sugar Refining Co. , more than $75 million in land and mills ; Standard Oil of New Jersey , installations worth $75 million , What became clear after Cuba was a factor more basic than Castroism . Private enterprise in Latin America has not progressed nearly so fast as the aspirations of the people , and thus is terribly vulnerable to the pressures of the modern world . Latin-American leftists , in fact , insist that the stage of their countries along the Marxist ladder of progression is not " capitalist " at all but " feudal . " Ever since the Spanish came in search of gold , leftists say , free enterprisers have devoted their energies to extraction of wealth rather than to building it up . Much of the building , as well as the extracting , was done by Americans . The American role , according to a New York broker who specializes in Latin America , " is the story of great men , of heroes . They went into the jungles , turning something savage into something productive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men like Henry Mciggs , who fled the California gold rush to escape his creditors , built railways up the mountains of Chile and Peru that still stand as engineering marvels , and who died dead broke once again . And of Meigg 's nephew , Minor Cooper Keith , who laid railroads through the Costa Rican jungles at a cost of 4,000 lives , and spun the 800,000 acres of swampland he received as part payment into the fantastic empire that became United Fruit . Or the Irish immigrant who landed in Peru during the guano boom of the mid-1800 's , flourished as a ship 's chandler and created the firm that still bears his name , W. R. Grace &; Co . Latin Americans of the left choose to remember the darker side of American involvement  --  the years of occupation by U.S. Marines , or the wild days of the 1920 's , when New York bankers pressed two billion dollars in high-interest loans into the hands of Latin politicians . In one Peruvian bond issue , a New York banking house paid a " commission " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Augusto Leguia for his role in talking his father into accepting issues totaling $90 million . After the crash , several countries faced annual interest charges that were higher than the national budget . Most of the two billion dollars had simply disappeared Boom to boom to boom The economy that these capitalists , heroic or otherwise , helped to build remained " colonial " long after political independence had come . Half of the eight-billion-dollar U.S. investment in Latin America today is in mining , mainly copper , and in petroleum  --  both of which are efficiently extracted and shipped abroad . " To Latin-American nationalists , " says a copper-company official regretfully , " taking something out of the ground is like stealing money from a chest . It 's gone forever . " The Latin-American economy has traditionally skittered from one boom to the next  --  first gold and silver , then guano and sugar and rubber , then copper and coffee and petroleum . But , though haphazardly built , this structure has developed over the years a certain resilience of its own . Part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from closed or static class . Old fortunes are constantly eroding . In most countries the original oligarchy , which was based on Spanish and Portuguese land grants , is rather hard up these days . In the Brazilian Northeast , for example , handsome porticoes are crumbling about aristocratic ears , only five of the twenty big sugar plantations in the Recife area showed a profit last year , and many of the owners , heirs to Portuguese titles they do not use , mortgage their crops , squeeze their tenants mercilessly and flee to Rio to forget their troubles . One eroder of fortunes is the high consumption habits of the wealthy  --  the cities are graced by the cupolaed palaces of older generations . the suburbs by the dazzling split levels of the new . Another factor was explained by a Venezuelan banker : " The rich are breeding at the same ferocious rate as the poor . They lose big families. ? Since custom , and in many countries law , dictates an even distribution of estates among the heirs , riches can spread quite thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where land is still the chief wealth and where the vast pampas are checker-boarded with thousands of prosperous farms in a pattern strikingly similar to the U.S. Midwest . As late as 1930 I could have named you the great families without a moment 's hesitation , " said a Buenos Aires editor . The breakup of the big estancius has changed all that beyond recognition . " The same process works less visibly in stocks and bonds . Oligarchs in the full glory of wealth and ancient lineage can of course still be found . The so-called " 14 families " of El Salvador , intricately intermarried , dominate that country 's economic life , though the winds of reform arc blowing from a progressive government . Even fewer and even richer families still adroitly run Panama 's economy and its politicsas well . Still virtually intact are the " 40 families " of Peru . Among the most illustrious of the clans are the Prados , who own cotton and sugar plantations , a bank , one whole Lima residential district called Por Venir , two insurance companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and radio network , and a virtual monopoly on all the cement produced in Peru . The most prominent Prado , Manuel , was president of Peru until 1962 , and one of his principal coups while in office shocked all upper-class Lima . After 40 years of an arranged first marriage , he shepherded an annulment through the Vatican and wed the sweetheart of his youth , Clorinda Malaga , who had waited all those years and who brought a dowry of about S15 million acquired from vanadium and molybdenum mines . " They are like honeymooners still , " a society dame in Lima reports forgivingly . " They 've built a house in Rinconada , off in the foothills of the Andes . Stucco and natural wood . He said , bring my carved balconies , ' and she said , ' I 'll bring the bronze clappers for the doors . ' " Another sterling Peruvian oligarch is Pedro de Osma , a plump and genial bachelor who spends a good part of his time in Europe and very little of it at the grubby business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines , " a friend explains . The de Osmas themselves date back to the 10th century innorthern Spain , where a town still bears their name . Pedro 's paternal grandmother was a Pardo , a family that has given Peru two presidents and that now owns a heavy interest in Goodrich of Peru , as well as cotton plantations on the coast , jute plantations in the jungle , several office buildings , a newspaper chain , an insurance firm , a fishmeal concern and an import-export business . The passion of Pedro de Osma 's life is the world 's finest collection of art and artifacts from the Spanish colonial period . He collects nothing modern or Incan , For to Pedro civilization peaked during the days of the viceroys . The softly glowing piles of gold and silver trinkets cram his Lima mansion and spill over into his several country homes . " It is a hobby that only a bachelor who owns a few mines could afford , " he explains modestly . " It is a place to have golden dreams . " Yet even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a de Osma or a Pardo but a German immigrant named Augusto Wiese , whose mother took in washing . As a child , Wiese went to work in a hardware store for a fellow German named Wagner , started a telephone-order service , bought out the boss on credit when Wagner got homesick for Germany , prospered and branched into real estate , manufacturing and finance . He presently is erecting a 2b-story Banco Wiese , which soon will be the tallest office building on the west coast of South America , and his fortune is estimated at well over S25 million . And it is the Wicses ss ho are typical of the Latin-American big rich these days . Their fortunes are new and enormous , based on commerce and industry rather than land . A surprising number of them are from immigrant families and acquired wealth through shrewdness , luck and a willingness to work harder than the old established Latin gentry . The richest man in Brazil is Francisco Matarazzo , son of an Italian immigrant who got his start boiling down pigs for lard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex of 300 firms , concentrated in food , textiles and chemicals but spreading so wide that Brazilians refer to it simply as " the Empire . " He is worth an estimated S75 million . The next biggest fortune is probably the one acquired by the late Israel Klabin , an immigrant from Latvia who started as a pushcart peddler , selling cigarettes and costume jewelry , and collecting rags , and built a pulp and paper combine that produces 90 percent of the newsprint used in Brazil . Eight arms bring money In Mexico , several big fortunes are in the hands of Spanish loyalists , who arrived as political exiles and have since se-en their starting capital pyramid gratifyingly in Mexico 's industrial boom . Latin America 's largest manufacturing concern , Siam di Tella of Argentina  --  cars , appliances , industrial products  --  is run by an Argentinian of British descent and owned by the heirs of the Italian immigrant who founded the company . Argentinians of Dutch , German and French descent own Latin America 's biggest trading firm , Bunge and Born , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locally as el Pulpo ? " the Octopus . " Like the newly rich anywhere , these millionaires have tended to ape the standards of the older aristocracy . Thcy have a particular fondness for ranches and plantations ; President Jorge Born of Argentina 's Bunge and Born , for instance , raises blooded Herefords . Intermarriage between new-rich and old-respectable is common . When a Wiese finally married into the de Osma family in Peru , one result was the sale of the Gran Hotel Bolivar , Lima 's finest . " It was quite all right for a Wiese to be an innkeeper , " a Lima socialite explains , " but not a Wiese de Osnia . " In the field of conspicuous consumption , a specialty of Latin America 's oldest families , one new name that stands out is that of playboy-diplomat Porfirio Rubirosa , who got his start by marrying a daughter of dictator Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic . Another is playboy-industrialist Francisco f Baby ) Pignatari , whose mother was a Matarazzo . Baby had spent most of his youth running his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headlines when , to herald the end of a round-the-world fling with actress Linda Christian , he sent a brass band and a corps of pickets to her Rio hotel with the blunt message : " Linda go home . " Most of Latin America 's industrial millionaires keep up excellent relations with powerful politicians , an arrangement of mutual benefit . Any list of Latin America 's richest men would have to in-elude a half dozen dictators past and present . Money changes hands for an import license , a government contract or title to a stretch of wilderness through which a highway will soon be built . A Brazilian editor explains ; " Politics is the only field in which a poor boy can get to the top quickly . At least four out of five of the new fortunes are probably being made that way . " This editor had just decided to quit his job , return to his home state and go into politics himself . This new blood , immigrant and political , has added both skill and zest to the capitalist structure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American executive in Venezuela . " They can close a complex deal very quickly and very shrewdly . If you 're not careful , you can come out without your pants . " They can function in smooth partnership with American capital when they choose to . Often they choose to attack it instead . " As pressure for social reform grows , " explains an official of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America , " there is a tendency to say , ' Well , if we have to do something , let 's nationalize the American companies . ' These anti-American capitalists own a number of important newspapers with which to advance their views . " Some have merely selfish motives , others are fanatic right-wing nationalists who were pro-Fascist during the war , and a few have embraced the extreme left despite their wealth . In Brazil the Communist-Socialist coalition that elected Gov . Miguel Arraes in the northeastern state of Pernambuco was bankrolled by S  --  o Paulo industrialist Jose Ermirio de Morals , who won a senate seat on the ticket . Later he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its effervescence , free enterprise in Latin America is not very free . It has spun elaborate cartels behind high tariff walls . In Chile , for example , a dozen financial and industrial groups with interlocking directorates control companies accounting for more than 70 percent of all domestic corporate investment . Government red tape spins further webs . Brazil has built , according to investment banker Eric Lamb of Rio , " an exchange structure which , though ingenious in the extreme as to special doors in the external financial wall surrounding the country , is so intricate that it literally can not be understood by anyone hying on the outside . " One purpose of all this , of course , is to limit the competition of American capital . The American companies under heaviest attack are those in fields thought of as " colonialist " by Latin Americans  --  land ownership , utilities and , in particular , mining . " The petroleum is ours " makes an always popular cry . Latin Americans think with an understandable shudder of Bolivia  --  an estimated $200 billion worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish conquest , and it now stands a mostly barren hulk. the poorest country in South America . " A surprising number of Chileans , " says an official of a U.S. copper company , " believes that once we get the copper to Perth Amboy New Jersey , we refine out untold quantities of gold . " The American companies are able to keep on doing business because they are superbly efficient , pay several times the going wage rate , and supply a huge , steady source of foreign earnings , ? , ? ithout which several Latin-American governments would probably collapse . " The rape of Venezuela , " says a Caracas politician , " is not that we are shipping oil abroad  --  but that until recently the one billion dollars in oil revenues collected by the government annually was in great part stolen or wasted when it could have completely transformed this country . " " I honestly believe , " says a copper-company official , " that the Chilean government is making more out of the copper industry now than if they took it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it themselves . " In Chile , copper accounts for more than 70 percent of all exports . The industry is dominated by two big American companies , Anaconda and Kennecott , whose tax bill averages about two thirds of profits and covers 14 percent of the Chilean budget . High in the Andes , the companies rip whole mountains down , freight and refine the ore and ship it abroad . They pay their workers better than two dollars an hour , about six times Chile 's average industrial wage . Fringe benefits begin with free delivery of babies , go on through free education , free housing , a gold watch after 30 years ' service , pensions and , finally , a free funeral . A subtle form of bribery Latin nationalists have little use for this cozy arrangement . They arc likely to look at the high wages and comfortable life of the copper workers as a subtle form of bribery  --  though no Latin politician has publicly advocated that this standard of living he cut . " But why not manufacture copper tubing and copper wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Chilean economist . " Even if the Chileans are capable ofdoing it , " answers a copper-company official , " the argument assumes that they are the only nationalists in the world . About eighty-five percent of the copper mined in Chile goes to Europe , and a good percentage of the rest to Japan . These countries depend for their very life on buying raw materials and selling their manufactured goods abroad . They simply would not let copper tubing and wire come into the country . " The basic argument is one painful for Latin Americans to accept : That with a world oversupply of most minerals just now , markets are as important as mines . The cold economic facts are so obvious in Venezuela that even the Communists do not advocate expropriation of the oil industry right now ? " though it is , of course , our eventual goal , " said Venezuela 's top Communist , Gustavo Machado , who is now in jail . If every oil valve in Venezuela were closed down tight , the same companies that dominate production there  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could open valves wider in the Middle East and soon make up all the losses from Venezuela . The American companies work hard to still any criticisms and keep their image bright . " Our average wage is better than that of most companies in the U.S. , " says Harry Jarvis , president of Creole Petroleum , the Jersey Standard subsidiary that is Venezuela 's leading producer . At a time two years ago when American money was leaving Venezuela , Creole President Jarvis talked his board of directors into sending $10 million in , to be used to help small Venezuelan business firms with good ideas get started . Since then the Creole Investment Corp . hasput up capital h.r more than 20 promising ventures , including a starch plant , a fiberboard factory , a ranch , a brick kiln and a passion-fruit plantation . " There was nothing altruistic about it , " says Jarvis . " But we arc delighted , of course , at how well it has been received . " When an extractive company 's image gets tarnished these days , trouble is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another subsidiary of Jersey Standard , was disliked by just about everybody , because it claimed outright ownership of Peru 's major oilfield and for years was virtually exempt from taxes  --  terms granted by corrupt dictator Augusto Leguia in 1922 . Peru 's new president , Fernando BelaUnde Terry , has told the company to pay a tax rate of 60 percent , plus an indemnity of S50 million , or get expropriated . A number of companies have found it profitable to avoid conflicts and do business in a new way . United Fruit , which once made and unmade Central American governments , has sold off 50,000 acres of banana lands and would like to sell the other 318,000 , preferring now to buy its fruit from local producers , whom it backs with financing and technical help . W. R. Grace &; Co. , content for almost a century with the profits from its plantations , shipping and trade along the west coast of South America , has branched energetically into chemicals , mostly in other parts of the world . The American and Foreign Power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has arranged to sell more than half of them to Latin-American governments and is investing the proceeds in such enterprises as an aluminum plant in Mexico , a . pctro-chemical complex in Argentina .

Balgooyen , " but the current trend in many countries is toward government ownership , and e stand ready to discuss terms of sale . " If instinctively suspicious of old-line **colonialist " companies , Latin Americans are hungry for the shiny consumer goods of the modern odd  --  especially when presented through the Americantechnique of a low markup , a fixed price and the soothing sound of canned music floating down handsome aisles . In Latin America a merchandising revolution has been set oil ' mostly by two firms , Sears , Roebuck and the Rockefellers ' I.B.E.C.

's supermarket chain in Venezuela opened five new stores last year , for a total of 20 , and prospers on a one percent profit on sales . I.B.E.C. has branched out into the dairy business in Venezuela , a hybrid-seed business in Brazil , poultry farms in three countries and low-cost house construction in Chile and Peru . It manages mutual investment funds in four countries with combined assets of more than $30 million . " The funds , " according to I.B.E.C. chairman Robert Purcell , " provide a means for the small people , the growing middle class , to invest in the industrial development of their country .

In his office in Bogota , a large but rather spare set of quarters for an executive of his rank , the Scars manager in Colombia , Norman Surbaugh , talked about some of the changes brought by Sears . " When we came here in 1952 , every shirt in Colombia was sold by neck size alone . I 'm a rangy man , and those shirts came up to my elbow . A simple thing like that , sleeve length on shirts , took us quite a while to put across . Now everybody does it . " We employ 1,158 Colombians and only eight North Americans , and we pay considerably more than the going wage , which is so low in many retail establishments that we simply would n't think of hiring at that rate .

It may not be good economics  --  low production volume and high costs  --  but its a fact of life . if American companies are faced with a choice of opening a plant down south or losing a traditional market , a good many of them will open the plant . " Manufacturing has accounted for more than half of all new U.S. investment in Latin America recently  --  about $100 million annually . Eager for markets but fearful of unfair treatment , more and more American firms are turning to the joint venture , whereby an American firm takes in local partners . " Ideally , " says an American investment adviser in Colombia , the American firm gets not only local capital but know-how , people with the right contacts who can find their way around in a maze of labor laws and import regulations , infinitely complex subjects .

Willys-Overland of Brazil was built on the same principle , with Kaiser personally guaranteeing a S42 million loan to get construction going in 1954 . Two years ago , with a great burst of national pride , Willys sent production-line models of the first all-Brazilian car from design to paint job , the AeroWillys 2600 , off to the international auto show in Paris . Today the firm produces more than one-third of all the cars made in Brazil . This company , " says a Rio editor , " is one of Brazil 's prides and joys .

But despite these hopeful signs , the bears speak in a loud , clear voice that is paid wide attention . Even the opportunities in manufacturing and the proven worth of the joint venture will not be enough to start any massive wave of investment in Latin America . " Certainly the continuance of the Castro influence will be a major deterrent , " said the Commerce Committee on the Alliance for Progress , a study group chaired by J. Peter Grace Jr .

" The shape of those institutions and their success or failure will depend mostly on the Latin-American capitalists , who own and run 70 percent of the economy . " The most important thing to be said about the oligarchy , " according to a Manhattan hanker , " is that Latin America at this stage can not do without them .

What one oligarch can accomplish has been shown by Eugenio Mendoza , 56 , Venezuela 's leading industrialist .
