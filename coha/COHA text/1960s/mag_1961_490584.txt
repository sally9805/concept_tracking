Notes and Comment FROM the University of Georgia last week there came stimulating news for everyone who is concerned with the progress of higher education . When two young Negroes arrived to enroll in that institution , the student body turned out in considerable force  --  not to welcome them , of course , but to exhibit hospitably the full depth and breadth of Southern intellectual attainments . There was , to begin with , the little band of scholars who , on hearing that the new students were in the other of the registrar , rushed into the corridor screaming , " Two , four , six , eight ! We do n't want to integrate ! " At a single stroke , these irtuosi contrived to display their command of scansion and rhyme , to show the wide scope of their mathematical learning , and to deliver , with scholarly eloquence , their most profound judgment on a difficult issue of the day . The following evening was devoted to field work in the Southern social sciences . Five or six hundred students gathered outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunter , to ascertain whether such a mob , armed with stones , fertile in obscenity , and untouched by any sense of the fundamental human decencies , had the power to frighten one girl . The results of this experiment appear to be ambiguous . It is quite possible that Miss Hunter , who is obviously a girl of courage , merely felt the same icy contempt for the demonstrators that is felt by the great majority of her fellow-citizens . After the young sociologists were finally brought under control by the police  --  who at first appeared reluctant to interfere with so interesting an experiment  --  the officials of the university announced that the two Negroes were to be suspended . This was a mistake . Both of them felt they had something to learn at college , and said so . But the polished young academics who secured their suspension clearly have no further need fur education . Intellectually speaking , they can afford to withdraw from the university at once and take up those dainty occupations for which their studies have fitted them . Their proper place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . Horwitt 's Horologe NI aesthetic nudge from a man who keeps himself posted on the progress of industrial design sent us to the side of Mr. Nathan George Horwitt , of Lenox , Massachusetts , who , our informant said , " has invented a watch dial without any numerals and with only one reference point , a small disc , on its face . " He went on , " The dial has been judged beautiful enough to go into the Museum of Modern Art 's display of recent acquisitions . Apparently , one can tell time to the minute by the dial despite the paucity of reference points . " Mr. Horwitt frequently comes to town , and the other morning we caught up with him in the lounge of a midtown hotel , where he pulled two slim , cyclopean wristwatches from his pocket . One , for evening wear , was encased in silver and had a silver disc  --  at the position occupied in more humdrum timepieces by the number twelve  --  and silver hands on a black background ; the other , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disc and black hands on a white background . According to a large old carriage watch , cluttered up with numerals of the hours and , indeed , of some of the seconds , that we cam in our pocket , it was ten after eleven , a fact that it was possible to learn , give or take a minute , from Mr. Horwitt 's babies . " This dial evolved from one I invented around 1932 , " he said . " It had an hour number and a minute number in the center , which changed on the hour and on the minute ; the thing looked like a scoreboard . I 'd resigned as director of advertising for Squibb and Lentheric a couple of years before to start a firm called Design Engineers , for which I created a few other products , such as a wall radio and a rotor refrigerator , but then I bought a dairy farm in upstate New York , and I was off designing for a while . I 've stopped milking cows  --  I bought a four-hundred-acre cowless farm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , . and collect mushrooms . I own a company , 13ragitette , Inc. , which has its own building a hundred yards from my house , and there I direct the sales of an adjustable picture frame that I invented . We 've sold two million frames to date . " Mr. Horwitt , who is sixty-two , trim , and mustached , told us that his watch is on sale at Black , Starr &; Gorham and Neiman-Marcus and is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art . " The Patent Office rejected it at first , as ' not deemed to constitute a patentable advancement , ' but on appeal this rejection was not sustained , " he said . He reached into a briefcase and drew out a document from the Patent Office Board of Appeals , which read : Appellant has pointed out the utter lack of any suggestion in the references relied upon by the examiner , of the unique and simple design involved herein . We agree that merely because the prior art may show clock and/or watch faces with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone to indicate each of the twelve hours , or may have numerals representing the twelve hours in association with a single dot-like area that this provides no suggestion for making a watch with only a single dot on the face thereof in addition to the hands . It seems to us that this is a concept directly contrary to the teachings of the prior art and thus would not occur to a routine designer in the exercise of his trade , and that it has resulted in a unique design in no way resembling the dials relied on by the examiner . In our opinion , appellant 's design is distinctive , ornamental and aesthetically pleasing , and when viewed as a whole , in no way gives an impression of merely being a modification of any design upon which the examiner relies . The decision of the examiner is reversed . We congratulated the victorious appellant anti , upon asking for pre-Squibb recollections , learned that he was born in Russia , came to New York when he was three , attended C.C.N.Y. , and served in the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advertising business as a copywriter for Ruthrauff &; Ryan , " he said . " One of my hobbies is music ; my wife and I live in Lenox because it 's near Tanglewood . We have two sons  --  a sculptor of twenty-five , and a sophomore at Bosom University . I still play touch football and tennis , but the thing I enjoy most is sitting on a tractor , cutting hay , early in the season , In 1951 , when there was a famine in India , I sent that country twelve hundred pounds of wheat through the Indian Consulate here . Newspaper comment was favorable , and I received a great many commendatory letters , including one from Louis Bromfield and one from William Lescaze . " Mr. Horwitt reached into his briefcase and pulled out an album of laudatory newspaper articles and letters . " I 'm an inveterate letters-to-the-editor writer in my area , " he said . " My favorite subjects are politics , conservation , and refuse dumping . Will you have lunch ? " We pled a prior engagement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said goodbye . ? MUSICAL INTELLIGENCE : The pro- gram for the East Berlin Komische Oper 's production of " La Boheme " includes a chart that shows the incidence of deaths from tuberculosis in Paris between 1901 and 1905 according to age and social status . Science MEMBERS of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , some seven thousand strong , came to town a week or so ago for their **26;2116;TOOLONG convention , holed up in assorted hotels , and began to kick around all sorts of ideas on such subjects as turtle courtship , flying telescopes , aggressive behavior in sheep , jack rabbits as strontium-90 monitors , North American phyllopod crustacea , lunar exploration , glaciation , and current problems in electrobiology . Since we did n't feel up to encountering our visitors at their headiest , we put off meeting them until they took a breather from their conferences to attend a blowout at the Commodore in honor of their retiring president , Paul E. Klopsteg , and his two successors  --  Chauncey D. Leake , who is serving in 1961 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving at the Commodore 's ballroom , where the party was being held , we were taken in tow by a tall , fair-haired lady scientist , more toothsome than any scientist we had ever met before . She told us that what we were attending was a symposium in the real sense of the word . " Here we shall have drinking , feasting , and good talk , " she said gaily , and propelled us into a nearby auditorium , where the presidents  --  past , present , and future  --  and various other A.A.A.S. representatives had gathered to listen to good talk . The speaker holding forth as we joined them was a white-haired man with an English accent , who urged everyone to end fragmentation in scientific pursuits and to see to it that learning in one field blended with learning in another . While we were listening to this , our lovely guide slipped away , to be replaced by a jovial character who introduced himself as Dr. Sidney S. Negus , chairman of the Department of Biochemistry of the Medical College of Virginia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a spot of bourbon in a section of the ballroom reserved for the press . We went along with the Doctor , and presently , after a convivial glass , found ourself in a discussion of ecology with the Doctor and a friend of his named John Jacoby . " I am interested , " said the Doctor 's chum , " in an ecological system that will make travel in space possible by employing plants to absorb the carbon dioxide exhaled in space flight and to supply needed oxygen . " The Doctor 's chum seemed awfully young to us , and we asked him where he was conducting his experiments . " At the moment , I 'm a junior at Jamaica High School and attend special classes once a week at Columbia . I am fourteen , " he said . " But to get hack to ecology , in Texas they have already kept mice alive for a month under conditions simulating those that will he met with in space flight . It is estimated that a hundred and twenty pounds of pure algae would he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mars , which would take three years . Artificial photosynthesis would probably do away with the necessity For live algae , but at present the algae are absolutely necessary . It was algae that brought me together with Dr. Negus  --  three years ago , at an A.A.A.S. convention in Washington . I wanted a pure strain , and I asked Dr. Negus to help me out . He put me in touch with Dr. Constantine Sorokin , of the University of Maryland , who had some fine material . " " One of these days , this boy is going to win a Nobel Prize , " said Dr. Negus . " I think the goal of man should be to increase the scope of his knowledge , " said Master Jacoby . " V4There can we find more scope than in space ? That is why I 'd like to he one of the first on Mars . " We got our young scientist down to earth long enough to learn that his father is a lawyer and his mother an elementary-school teacher . " You probably wonder what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actually , I do menial chores at the convention  --  run errands , empty ashtrays , sweep floors  --  hut I do have time to listen to the symposiums . " We left Dr. Negus and Johnny to their ecological business and drifted out into the ballroom proper , which had by this time been furnished with tables bearing punch bowls . The presidents and their associates were milling about , and as we passed among them we heard comments on the convention , not all of them complimentary . " One whole day , and not one exhilarating thought ! " said an intense-looking dark-haired woman . " I could not agree less on this attitude toward pre-growth , " said a man with a beard . " What 's in this punch ? " said a portly character . " Grenadine , lemon juice , brandy , and soda , " a young lady responded . We asked her how she knew . " I work for the hotel , " she said The punch scholar moved along , and we were buttonholed by a man who asked us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing by the Soviet Union . " Yes , " we replied . " Most people have no idea of the Russians ' skill in prefabrication and in the use of reinforced concrete , " he said . We said we found that very fascinating , and went our way . Lighthearted Lender THE palship that banks are trying to establish with their customers has now reached its cozy zenith . The other day , a lady we know wangled a small loan out of Chase Manhattan and received her check wrapped in a handwritten note that read , " Happy spending ! Your friend at Chase . " Dame Edith , WE had a great lunch last week with a great actress , perhaps the greatest of all , in the opinion of many actors and actresses  --  Dame Edith Evans , who is here for the first time in over a decade and is rehearsing for her first American television play , " Time Remembered , " an N.B.C . " Hallmark Hall of Fame " production scheduled for February 7th , the day before Dame Edith 's seventy-third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall , the Central Plaza , at Second Avenue and Seventh Street . just as she was finishing a run-through of a scene . She detached herself , quietly and respectfully , from her producer-director , George Schaefer , and from a fellow-actor , Christopher Plummer , for one more walk over the floor markings that had just been worked out for stage positions in the play . The walk took no more than fifteen seconds , and it did our heart good every second of the fifteen to watch her  --  looking at least twenty years younger than her age , with her gray hair bobbed short and her shoes low-heeled and British/y sensible , and wearing a gray tweed skirt , a dark-gra ) sweater with a gold pin at the neckline , heavy Indian silver bracelets on her wrists , rings on her fingers , and hells , we 'd swear , on her toes . As she finished her quick walk over the floor markings , she gave a nod of assent to herself and to her director , who freed her for lunch and suggested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was right downstairs , so she would n't have to bother putting on her coat . " Sounds wonderful , " Dame Edith said . " Yesterday , I had a great big delicious Italian lunch , and it was too much . An enormous , delicious veal cutlet , and it was absolutely delicious . Today , I 'd like to eat pancakes . I 've been looking for pancakes or waffles ever since I arrived . All the old waffle places are gone . I looked for a place I used to know  --  Childs  --  and when I found it , I discovered that it had been torn down . I walked about with a friend , and we could n't find any of the old waffle places , but then , luckily , we found some waffles at a Howard &; Johnson . " Dame Edith put on a chic hlack stove-pipe ) hat , and we went down to Ratner 's , where she asked our waiter for pancakes . " Blintzes , " the waiter said . " What kind ? " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If I told you , would you remember ? " the waiter asked . " Yes , " Dame Edith said . " All right , " the waiter said , and recited , " Potato blintzes , kashe blintzes , cheese blintzes , ichwar or jell ) blintzes , and huckleberry , pineapple , cherry , and strawberry blintzes . All right ? " " Sounds wonderful , " Dame Edith said . " I shall be ver ) pleased to try cherry blintzes . " " In the meantime , cat a pumpernickel bagel , " the waiter said , indicating a basket of rolls on the table . Dame Edith peered longingly at the basket . " It would be too much , " she said , " Last night , I could n't eat more than porridge and a glass of milk after that delicious veal cutlet . I 'm staying at a small hotel near here . I could n't face coming all the way down every day . I have no luxuries , like hot milk at night , and no night services , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bath , and I love to find my way about . I love walking . I walk to re hearsal from the hotel through streets that are a quiet part of the world . I love old city . Last time , I stayed at a hotel on Fiftieth Street , and I loved walking about , looking for gardens anti little houses . I think new city should be new , but leave the old alone . I 've been here for several days , and I ca n't say I was at all tired when I arrived . I am very fortunate that way . I travel by plane , and the minute I leave England , I start thinking American time . On arrival , I just get a bath and go out to dinner . I need only six or seven hours ' sleep a night , but I seldom get them in one whack. .1 get them in three or four goes . I am very , very lucky that way . " The blintzes arrived , and Dame Edith tasted one . " Delicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fifty years ago , people would come in here and for ten cents they would get ; i blintz that big . " He measured off a foot with his hands . " Now it costs three times as much , and look at the size ! " He shook his head . " I do n't know how working people can afford to eat , " Dame Edith said . " You have to pay so much for everything . " " You said it ! " the waiter exclaimed . " Now eat . " Dame Edith ate . Between bites , she told us that although this play was her first try at television here , she had made several television appearances in England , and that she liked acting in any medium . " Good acting is good acting all over the world , " she said . " And had acting is had acting anywhere . I 'm satisfied as long as I have a sen- sitive director , and not someone who wants to he tricky . Tricky is always bad . In rehearsing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up your mind about how you 're going to play a part , and you do n't have much more than that for a play . I like to find a way to do things that gets the biggest result with the least amount of effort  --  that is , effort that can he seen , I 'm a great believer in the process of deletion . I do n't do more as I go along in rehearsal . I do less . " After a pause for a few more bites of cherry blintz , Dame Edith went on , " I was very lucky , very lucky . I did n't have to fight to get on the stage . I was put there . And I started late . I did n't go on the stage until I was twenty-four . Before that , I was a milliner for ten years . I made hats . I always worked for someone else , and I did like it , but when I went on the stage I knew I was home . I felt comfortable . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do watch them . When we made hats , we used to stretch the velvet onto canvas . I think they stick everything on now . When I buy a hat , I know what to do to it if it 's not quite right . I was never interested in the stage before I went on it . I never acted as a child . My father was a civil servant . I was an only child , and very , very active . I had a brother , who died when he was four years old and I was two . I had a great deal of physical energy . As a child , I was considered naughty . At church , I would kneel on the seat and look round and sing very loudly . My poor mother ! I read a lot and played rough games . I was always overactive . The energy is all right now . We 've got it harnessed . But it 's taken a long time . Because I was put on the stage  --  a friend put on Shakespeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a famous old producer , and he gave me a contract  --  I 've always been aware that things came easily to me , and I 've always felt I must not take advantage of it . " In the old days , you made your way up by steps . It was lovely , because you learned to speak , to be heard . Nowadays , a good many actors are too busy talking with microphones . I learned with good people  --  all good actors . The older actors would teach me how to make the best of myself . You were told the way you moved , the way you looked , the way you spoke . The older ones were professional . On the dot . The word ' amateur ' may come from the word ' love , ' but the professional makes the final sacrifices . Ellen Terry was a lovely person and a great professional , too . In 1918 , a few years before I was married my husband died twenty-six years ago ; he was an oil mining engineer  --  I toured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in variety theatres . She was gracious , kind , charming , thoughtful . She was someone you loved . And you could hear what she said . There was no television then and no cinema  --  just theatre and concerts . She 'd say to me , ' Smile , child . Smile , child . You have a lovely smile . ' I was shy and nervous and young and just beginning and gauche , and the older ones knew how to say things to make you feel good and to make you happy . All the older ones were like that . " It 's not as easy to help some of the young ones today . I 've heard over here that so many of the young ones go to psychiatrists to find , as they say , their real selves . ' Rubbish ! I do n't know any actors myself who go to a psychiatrist , and I 'd think they were potty if they did . They 're skipping life . They 're shirking . You find your real self by getting around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was young , I was always looking about . I was n't a very conventional anything . The good actors , I believe , do n't go about thinking about themselves all the time . You go about with your eyes open . You are open to all experience that comes your way . Character counts tremendously . It 's the vase in which you hold the talent . I used to watch a young friend who had great talent , and I 'd wonder if his character would someday equal his talent , as it would have to if he were to develop into a fine actor , and it did eventually . Today , it 's difficult for the young person of talent , because of all the temptations to do things for money . Or , as soon as a young actor shows talent , he 's immediately booked for films . " Our waiter returned and said to Dame Edith , " You left one blintz . You should cat it . " " I ca n't , " Dame Edith said . " You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did n't know any better , " Dame Edith said . " Would it he awful if I broke a piece off this just a piece ? " She pointed a finger at a pumpernickel bagel . " You should eat the whole thing , " the waiter said . " just a little piece , " Dame Edith said firmly , and broke it off . " And have a little hit of butter . " She put the hit of butter on the hit of bagel and sighed . " I 've been fortunate , " she said . " I 've had the most wonderful opportunities , and they 're still coming- "
