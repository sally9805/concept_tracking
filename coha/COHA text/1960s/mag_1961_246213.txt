The long , electrified fence around Leopoldville 's Lovanium University was in place and ready for Parliament to begin . United Nations troops waited to take up their posts as guards to ensure that no liquor , women or bribe money was smuggled in to addle the judgment of the Deputies . Only thing missing was the legislators themselves . Just at the moment when it seemed that the Congo 's Parliament would reconvene to reunite the divided Congo nation , the whole project collapsed . <P> Atop the wreckage stood grinning , pop-eyed Moise Tshombe of separatist Katanga province . Fortnight earlier , Tshombe had talked his way out of his confinement in a Leopoldville villa with solemn pledges to merge Katanga with the rest of the Congo ; as Moise left for home , he embraced his old enemies , showered them with compliments . But once he was back in the safety of Katanga , crafty Tshombe changed his tune . The agreement signed in Leopoldville was forced from him under duress , he sneered . Last week Tshombe 's regime declared that Katanga would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor would it join a customs union with the rest of the Congo . Above all , Katanga 's Moise Tshombe would not be sending any delegates to sit in Leopoldville 's Parliament . <P> Problem of Arithmetic . With this news , the politicians in Leopoldville abruptly lost interest in the democratic processes they had so fervently advocated . Army Commander General Joseph Mobutu openly opposed Parliament 's return . So did Foreign Minister Justin Bomboko . Kasavubu himself stalled off the U.N . officials who urged him to go ahead and formally declare the opening of Parliament , with or without the delegates . His reason : without Katanga 's votes , control of the legislature just might swing to the Communist-backed regime of that other prominent Congolese secessionist , Stanleyville 's Antoine Gizenga , who runs Eastern province . <P> Huddling grimly with his close aides , General Mobutu seemed determined to prevent Gizenga 's return to national influence at any cost , and suspicion rose that the 30-year-old army chief might try to grab control of the central government with a military coup d'etat to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A year after independence , the Congo 's economy was a national mess . Katanga , whose copper mines have missed hardly a day 's work through all the troubles , was booming . But in the rest of the Congo , 70% of the labor force was unemployed . Exports , which before independence averaged $20 million a month , had dropped to $6.5 million . Inflation had pushed food prices up 20% , and building construction was at a complete standstill . Yet , by African standards , the Congo is a rich country , and somehow things faltered on , thanks mainly to the U.N. , which had poured in tens of millions of dollars for famine relief and civil servants ' salaries , helped run the government as best it could with its small staff of specialists . The U.N . ' s 20,460 troops had slowly but surely brought an end to bloodshed in a land whose quarreling tribes had been slaughtering one another by the hundreds . <P> All that was needed was to get the politicians to shake hands and forget the past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the Congo 's quarreling politicians could manage .
