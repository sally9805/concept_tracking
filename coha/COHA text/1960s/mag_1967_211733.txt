Officially , British companies bidding for government contracts are allowed to plan on a maximum profit of 7% . Unofficially , they can make up to 20% . Actually , many of them do a great deal better than that . Or so it seemed last week as Parliament was embroiled in a brouhaha triggered by the news that on a contract for overhauling aircraft engines , the Bristol Siddeley division of the Hawker Siddeley Group had rung up profits of 63% . <P> Directors of the company maintained that they had no knowledge of any overcharges-which for some work amounted to twice the contract price . Ministry of Technology officials said that they had realized the company 's profits were excessive , but that they had been refused access to Bristol Siddeley 's books . Trying to cool the criticism , Minister of State ( Technology ) John Stonehouse told Commons that though Bristol Siddeley 's contract was not open to renegotiation , so that the company was not obliged to repay any money , its directors had agreed to return $11 million of excess profits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have brought things to a satisfactory conclusion , " said <P> Stonehouse . Commons , however , was not in the mood to pay tribute to anyone . And the very fact that Bristol Siddeley turned loose so much money only increased suspicions that something was wrong . <P> Indeed , while both the ministry and the company bore their share of criticism , Britain 's defense industry contracts seemed to be the main target of the debate . Critics in the press and Parliament alike were quick to remember that the same thing happened only three years ago , when Ferranti , Ltd. , repaid $12 million after acknowledging an 82% profit manufacturing Bloodhound missiles . Since then , there has been no significant change in the basis for contracting . The government still has no legal redress for excess profits . <P> <P> The obvious loser in this unbusinesslike scheme is Britain 's aircraft industry . It is foundering between inefficiency and inordinately high profits . The expense of developing the TSR 2 bomber , for example , became so outlandish that the government instead decided to buy 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after innumerable problems with British-made equipment , put $154 million down on six Boeing 747s . <P> Inevitably , the Bristol Siddeley affair is expected to reach far beyond the balance sheets of any one company . Its settlement surely will affect the future of Britain 's aviation industry and , if parliamentary critics have their way , the entire practice of defense-industry contracting .
