Akira Kurosawa is the Homer of the current cinema , and like Homer he some times nods . Yet in two pictures now showing in the U.S. , the great Japanese director ( Rashomon , Ikiru , Yojimbo ) demonstrates that the energy of genius can make a miss almost as exciting as a hit . <P> The Idiot , a Japanization of the Dostoevsky novel , is Kurosawa 's favorite Kurosawa picture . Made in 1951 , the film ran on for 165 minutes . Appalled , Kurosawa 's crassly commercial distributor ( Shochiku ) hacked it down to 90 minutes . The uncut original has never been shown in public-until now . Thanks to a culture-conscious exhibitor named Dan Talbot , the unmitigated Idiot has had its world premiere in Manhattan-and the showing showed that the crassly commercial distributor was absolutely right . <P> The trouble seems to be that Kurosawa got fascinated with Dostoevsky 's genius and forgot about his own . He follows with nearsighted assiduity every thread of the novelist 's intricately woven tale . What 's more , he too often tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to translate the words into correlatively compelling images . Nevertheless , the film skillfully counterfeits the look of Russia in the last century-it was shot in a small town in northern Japan in the dead of winter-and it brilliantly intuits the mystical spirit of Russian Christianity . The demonic nature of that spirit is portrayed by Toshiro Mifune ; the angelic aspect by Masayuki Mori , who marvelously distinguishes in his expression what is specifically Christian from what is peculiarly Oriental in religious feeling : the light in the eyes of a saint from the light in the eyes of a sage . <P> Sanjuro , a sequel to Yojimbo , was made to make money , and it did . But in titillating the mass audience , Kurosawa evidently bored himself . In Yojimbo , he had an urgent idea : man is a beast and the world is better off without him . In Sanjuro , he confesses , " I had very little to say . " He says it with impressive skill . Moviegoers who missed Yojimbo will assuredly find Sanjuro a bloody good show .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
