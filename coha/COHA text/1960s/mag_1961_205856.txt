The Senate launched the 87th Congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative battle , but in contrast with the House 's guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a Capitol guide 's speech . Question at issue : How big a vote should be necessary to restrict Senate debate-and thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters ? <P> A wide-ranging , bipartisan force-from Minnesota 's Democratic Hubert Humphrey to Massachusetts ' Republican Leverett Saltonstall-was drawn up against a solid phalanx of Southern Democrats , who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills . New Mexico 's Clint Anderson offered a resolution to change the Senate 's notorious Rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the Senators present and voting to cut off debate , instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds . Fair Dealer Humphrey upped the ante , asked cloture power for a mere majority of Senators . Georgia 's Dick Russell objected politely , and the battle was joined . <P> Privately , the liberals admitted that the Humphrey amendment had no chance of passage . Privately , they also admitted that their hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Republican Richard Nixon . In 1957 Nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of Senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new Congress , and that any rules laid down by previous Congresses were not binding . <P> Armed with the Nixon opinion , the Senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week . Hopefully , the perennial battle of Rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all .
