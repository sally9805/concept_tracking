To the Indians who flourished in Latin America before Columbus , gold was absolutely sacred . The Aztecs of Central Mexico called it " teocuit latl , " ( the excrement of the gods ) . The Incas of Peru thought of it as the " sweat of the sun . " The metal was so plentiful and easy to work that the pre-Columbian Indians used it to make earrings , pendants , funerary masks , drinking vessels , furniture , and even entire artificial gardens . In fact , they used the gold they loved so much for practically everything but money ; for that , they chose humbler commodities like beans . <P> More interested in bullion than beauty , the Spanish conquistadores who overran the Indians in the 16th century systematically plundered all the golden artifacts they could find , either converting them to ingots on the spot or shipping them to Spain to be melted down . As a result , pre-Columbian objets d'art are so rare that any display of them is a notable event . <P> A current , particularly choice event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibit of 136 pieces originally excavated from Indian graves and drawn from 29 public and private collections ( see color opposite ) . Last week the exhibit finished a month 's run at Boston 's Museum of Fine Arts ; it will open at Chicago 's Art Institute in February and move to Richmond 's Virginia Museum in March . <P> Innocent Beauty . Selected by Allen Wardwell , 33 , curator of primitive arts at the Art Institute , the comprehensive exhibit shows how the ancient Indian goldsmiths ground , hammered and cast the precious metal into highly stylized objects . Though the innocent beauty of the pieces was lost on the greedy conquistadores , it has intrigued modern artists such as Lipchitz , Moore , Klee , Brancusi and Dubuffet . <P> Jaguars , snakes , frogs and alligators , as well as human faces and figures , provided the artisans with their motifs . The goldsmiths executed them with increasing sophistication . The very first of them , the Chavn Indians of Peru , for example , had only crude stone tools with which to beat the pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later Quimbaya Indians of Colombia , who discovered how to make alloys of gold and copper and also mastered the sophisticated " lost-wax " technique of casting . First , the Indians made a model of the sculpture in beeswax or resin and covered it with a powdered charcoal and then a thick layer of clay . Next , they applied heat , melting the wax so that it ran out a channel in the hardened clay impression . They then used the impression as a breakable mold , pouring the molten gold in through the channel in the clay . It is the same method that dentists use today in making gold inlays.
