 | Neighbors to All the World IN APRIL 1951 , a rangy young pro ' fessor of philosophy at Oklahoma City University sat in his study running through a sermon he was to give as guest preacher at St. Luke 's Methodist Church the following Sunday . When Prof. John Peters had finished , he idly switched on his radio . Coming over the air was the voice of Gen. Douglas MacArthur , giving his " old soldiers " address before the U.S. Congress . The professor 's sermon slipped unnoticed to the floor as MacArthur described the Asian masses , hungry and leaderless , falling by the millions to communism . Warned MacArthur , " If we will not devise some greater and more equitable system to help these peoples , Armageddon will be at our door . " Peters had faced Armageddon . He could remember a shattering day six years before when , as a U.S. Army chaplain in the Philippines , he had held in his arms a mortally ' wounded farm boy from Tennessee . Powerless to save the lad , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll do something , so help me God , to keep this thing from happening again ! " Yet , actually , what had he done ? His mind aflame after hearing MacArthur , Peters worked on a new sermon through that night and the next day . When he stepped into the pulpit on Sunday , he spoke in a  | voice he scarcely recognized as his own . Peters described the Asian poor as he had seen them during World War II : " Mothers bringing their emaciated and fever-ridden babies to our aid stations , begging for medicines to check their suffering ; long lines waiting patiently under the blazing sun or in the driving rain for the privilege of dipping into our garbage cans to relieve their constant , gnawing hunger . Those millions ask , Who will help us ? ' and far too often the only voice they hear and the only hand they see are the voice and hand of communism . " He closed with a challenge : " There are men of means and intelligence listening to me this morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to rise and show what they can do for their world ! " The sermon 's effect was electric . At the door , a group of laymen surrounded him to say , " John , we 're ready to practice what you 've preached . Tell us what to do ! " A New Approach . Peters protested that he had no blueprint for action ; he was only laying out " broad basic issues . " Undeterred , the laymen called a meeting for the next day and , within hours , dispatched the professor east to confer with mission boards and foreign-aid specialists , private and governmental , and to bring back " a workable plan of action . " Before long he had resigned from the university , incorporated the infant movement under the name World Neighbors and was off on a world trip to survey needs . Today , 14 years later , WN touchc the lives of more than five million people in the world 's neediest areas ; and has put more than 3000 village of Asia , South America and Afri on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget of aroun $400,000 , World Neighbors co mands the time and energy of so 2800 workers ( mostly unpaid volu teers ) , who oversee more than major projects in i8 countries ? gent proof of what limited fun carefully invested , can accompli Three basic guidelines ma World Neighbors extraordinary : ? Material aid must be kept to absolute minimum ; World Nei bors will offer " a hand up , not handout . " Says Peters : " We are called to be our brother 's keep we are called to be our brothe brother . " ? World Neighbors must wo only at the village level , with " man in the rice paddy " ? the m who is bypassed in most grandi foreign-aid schemes . ? Most important , World Nei bors must go where the need ? a therefore the peril ? are most p nounced . And WN will go th with no prepackaged formula to pose . Instead , it will find someo who has already started a so work but is having difficulty sustaining it , get into harness with h @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can pull it together . " Realizing a Dream . A logi place to begin was South In where poverty seemed direst p 129 where , in 1952 , millions of people voted communist . At Katpadi , 90 miles west of the city of Madras , Peters found " someone already attempting something " : agricultural missionary Dr. J. J. DeValois , a graduate of Iowa State University . I ) eValois had started a small , struggling agricultural institute to train orphan Indian boys . The dream he held to , though there was little chance of ever realizing it , was a " total community-development program " for the surrounding impoverished , famine-stricken villages . In the next few months the two men put together a team of " county agents " ( American and Indian ) who new something about helping people help themselves . By the end of 952 they had four specialists in griculture , literacy , public health and village industries , with nine asstants drawn from the nearby area , and at work in a score of villages . Their first concern was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their values demonstrated . armers were then encouraged to xperiment with their own plots . On villagers were doubling their roduction . Following basic World Neighbors rocedure , nothing was given away . At Katpadi , villagers " bought " imroved seed for an equal amount of or , devitalized seed ; a wizened ative cock was traded for a pureed White Leghorn rooster ; a wood plow exchanged for a steel one . . , tier , when goods , equipment or . , Is were needed to begin approved projects , funds were advanced by World Neighbors and repaid into a " revolving loan fund , " run by the villagers themselves , on a long-term , low-interest basis . Says Dr. Walter H. Judd , a member of WN 's board of trustees : " World Neighbors resists the temptation to give material away , not because it needs what the . people are able to pay , but because the people need to pay it , as an essential part of the process of developing resourcefulness . " Within a few years scores of villages in South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a training program set up for midwives , all-important where doctors and nurses were almost nonexistent . Literacy clubs ? members ' first task after learning to read was to teach others ? were formed . Rural youth clubs sprang up , with such projects as the increased planting of papaya trees and home-lot gardens , the making of compost pits , even improving drainage facilities and building new roads . Mileage on the Dollar . World Neighbors ' early successes in India sparked enthusiastic response from Americans . While no " big money " came in , thousands began contributing dimes and dollars . Then , in September 1952 , a group of 5o U.S. business and religious leaders concerned with promoting " private ' responsibility in the achievement of world peace " combined forces with WN . Soon telling the World Neigh- bors story were such powerful voices as those of Carlos P. Romulo , Frank Laubach and Dr. Norman Vincent Peale . Although World Neighbors has taken on a national character , its home office in Oklahoma City remained modest . Says WN 's director of administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many organizations like ours grow in staff and facilities to outsized and inefficient proportions . " Of World Neighbors ' total budget , about ten percent is spent on such administrative items as salaries , travel and maintenance of headquarters . Board member Roy C. Ingersoll , honorary chairman of Borg-Warner Corp. , after making a visit to WN projects in the Philippines , said , " The mileage this organization gets out of a dollar is amazing . " The big expense in most foreignaid projects , Peters believes , accrues from doing for people instead of challenging them to do for themselves . " In emergent nations , " he says , " many officials are drawn from privileged classes who traditionally scorn those below them . The villager senses that scorn , and returns it measure for measure . But give him a chance to prove that he can raise himself economically , and he is quick to respond . " Joy in Helping Others . As proof , World Neighbors can point to Bago Bantay in the Philippines . Five years ago it was a bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Manila in 1953 and dumped onto rocky , barren land ten miles from the city . There were no roads , no lights , no water ; and all appeals for these bare amenities had been ignored . Bago Bantay quickly became a hotbed of antigovernment sentiment . Invited to Bago Bantay , a W husband-and-wife team named R man and Belen Almazan settled ' to help the villagers rehabilita themselves . Disease-ridden Ba Bantay 's first need obviously w sanitation ; gutters were awash wi sewage and paths piled high wi garbage . Almazan brought in mold for an inexpensive toilet bo got the people to provide ceme showed them how to make t bowls and also how to hollow brie for septic tanks and garbage pi From there the self-help club to over ? and shortly there were m than 300 families with their o toilets and garbage pits . Next , an army bulldozer was b rowed to build roads , the people paying for the fuel and the operator 's wage . When surfaces had b leveled , the village made a fiesta lining the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged with a nearby coconut fiber factory . Seeds for vegetable gardens were obtained . Backyard piggery and poultry projects we begun ; unemployed teen-agers were soon learning bamboo crafts other skills from their elders . Good Neighbors club , started by women to teach sewing and hall crafts , was soon producing items  | sale in Manila shops . In a matter of three years Bago Bantay was a bustling , thriving community , drawing envious visitors from neighboring barrios . When one of these , Bahay Toro ? an impoverished community of 600 milies ? asked , " How did you do ? " the people of Bago Bantay proudly went to Bahay Toro to demonstrate . Within six months , Bay Toro was well on its own way to se1f-rehabilitation . A Vote for the Bullocks . In many as where World Neighbors has been active , communists have either parted or defected . A prime example is a man named Ponnuswamy , who was sent by the Communist Party into an impoverished valley the Telegu section of South India . Carged with stirring up discord , shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communism . But one day Joseph John , director a World Neighbors-supported eject in the area , learned that Ponnuswamy 's wife was desperately John approached the communist . Without medical care , " he said , " your wife will die . Let us help you . " esitantly , Ponnuswamy brought wife to the dispensary , where her ase was brought under control . While she was recovering , Ponnumy watched landless laborers ing land of their own , literacy classes operating , mothers ' clubs learning child care . Seeking out , he said , " I became a communist - because I was concerned about needs of the masses . I was taught that only communists care . Yet you are doing what we 've only talked about . What makes you do these things ? " Replied John : " We know that a better world can come only from men who love their neighbors as themselves . " Abruptly , Ponnuswamy blurted , " I would like to be that kind of man . Can I join you ? " Today Ponnuswamy is the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Christian concern , writing dramas exposing communism 's weaknesses . In India at election time , signs of two parties are plastered everywhere : the Congress Party 's symbol of two bullocks , the Communist Party 's symbol of a sickle . When , during a recent election , communist leaders came to Ponnuswamy 's valley to discover why the Red vote had fallen to almost nothing , they were met with this reply : " For years we were your sickle , reaping votes for you , and nothing happened . Now we have bullocks and plows ; we no longer wear the rags of the outcast . Do you wonder why we vote for the bullocks ? " Hopeful Hearts . In recent years World Neighbors has multiplied greatly its projects in Africa and Latin America ? largely under the direction of its energetic overseas director , Merlin Bishop . There is , for example , Galindo on the Cauca River in northern Colombia . Here , in one of the world 's dreariest back- waters , World Neighbors in 1962 found Carlos Delgado . A small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the grip of feudal landlords . With no formal schooling beyond the fourth grade , he nevertheless had studied enough medicine , dentistry , law and pedagogy to meet the people 's minimum needs . Freeing them from economic serfdom , however , was more difficult . Seasonal floods regularly washed off the topsoil and wiped out their crops . Wealthy landowners grazed their stock on the only public land available to peasants . Profiteers bought their raw rice for one fourth of what it later cost the people to buy it back processed . Delgado was struggling to form a crude-rice cooperative when WN came to his aid . A small loan provided a generator , rice mill and other needed equipment . Filled with new hope , the villagers accomplished the backbreaking task of erecting a waterproof rice barn , with storage space for grain and equipment ; hauled tons of dirt for fill to lift the edifice above the flood line , made 4000 concrete blocks , felled and hand-sawed trees to complete the structure . The basic food shortage now licked , income from surplus rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legal rights to use public lands have been obtained , newt tracts of land cleared , and members of the cooperative are saving for a new school . Other poor villager along the Cauca River have come t Galindo to marvel , gone back start , with World Neighbors hel their own regeneration . Says Delgado : " For the first ti in memory , my people 's bellies a filled with enough food . But , bett yet , for the first time their hearts a full of hope ! " A Thousand Open Doors . Wor Neighbors projects have prov conclusively that implanting t self-help incentive is the surest route to lifting the vast millions of t world 's poor and disinherited . S. John Peters : " Once people touched with the magic of pride doing for themselves , they are the way to a self-transformati that nothing can stop . Across t globe there are a thousand do standing ajar for those who will j hands and hearts in real peoplepeople effort . The power of ' just p pie ' is limitless . But it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insti tions or to government . " @#
