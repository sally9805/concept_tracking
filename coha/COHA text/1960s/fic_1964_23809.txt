Orvieto Dominos , Bolsena Eels . . A story by Richard G. Stern , The wind in Edward 's Lungs , stored up so long , now had American sails to fill . The white Fiat beetle was rattled as much by this release from his Italian captivity as from the ninety kilometers of the Via Cassia it consumed every hour . Vicky , however , was not much of a sail . Most of her morning 's strength had gone into evading The Group . Once they were off in the blue bus , she felt like taking to her bed . After all , they 'd had lots of warnings about being picked up , and though Eddy was an American , he was twenty-five , a man of the world , and clearly capable of international designs . But was n't this secondary ? After all , she 'd come to Italy to see and learn , and Eddy both knew things and talked wonderfully about them . It was he who 'd shown her that the Moses statue in San Pietro in Vincoli was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guide put it , but something more complex , witness the hands , not " clenched inhanker " but only stroking the beard reflectively . Though Eddy admitted at dinner that it was Freud who 'd first pointed this out , he had , after all , read Freud , whereas The Guide had probably never heard of him , unless a plaque on one of the tours indicated that Freud had gone to the johnny somewhere in Nineteen Ought Two . Anyway , if you started to ask The Guide a question in the middle of his lecture , he 'd wave you away , afraid he might pick up in the wrong sentence , and leave The Group without the hot news that the Sistine 's Giudizio Unive  --  sale was painted thirty years after the ceiling . And then , it was so much nicer having your own car . Eddy hired the Fiat Six Hundred right after she 'd agreed to come with him , He did things right . Though she could just see her father , laid up in bed after a fall from Sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  getting the news from The Group that Victoria 69 had gone off to Orvieto for a night of God-knowswhat with a strange man . Not that there was going to be any funny stuff . A little woo-pitching , fine , but , though she knew she must be passionate from the way she 'd felt hundreds of woo-pitching times , Vicky knew also it was wiser to save that for when you had nothing else in life but diapers . In the Flower Market , just across the street from Portinari Drive-Yourself , Eddy had picked up a still-creamy lily from one of the unsold hundreds thrown there by the vendors , and she had its curling flake in her wallet as a good-luck charm against the possible evils of the expedition . It was going to go all right . " I 'm sorry , I did n't get it , Eddy . I was thinking about the darn Group . Will they be surprised ! They were going to Orvieto Thursday , though they never make up their stupid minds till it 's too late to plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naples , bathing suits , towels , everything , and where did we end up but in Cerveteri and Tarquinia looking at Etruscan tombs ! Not that they were n't great but we did n't use our suits till Saturday . At Ladispoli . The sand was as black as your hair . Which is great for hair , but creepy to walk on . You had the feeling every dirty foot since the Etruscans had dragged itself on the beach . " " It 's probably just the composition of the rock . Even the Tyrrhenian 's forceful enough to launder a beach . " They 'd planned to eat lunch in Viterbo , but Edward was so hungry that they turned off the Via Cassia at a place called Caprarola to find food . He pulled out the Baedeker and , to his amazed delight , saw that the little goat town was the site of " one of the most magnificent ch  --  teaux of the Renaissance built by Vignola in 1547-59 for Cardinal Alexander Farnese . " He read this to Vicky as if talking about an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what few tourists would see , his Baedeker being sixty years old and this road fit for little more than goats and Fiat beetles . Theirs crawled down the hill in second , and , sure enough , high on the town like a beautiful forehead , was a gray palace . " Let 's eat first , " said Edward , " though I 'll bet there is n't even a trattoria in this metropolis . " Which seemed to be correct , though down at the bottom of the hill there was a caf ? . They bought four gorgeous chocolate cakes shaped like the funny Etruscan tumuli at Cerveteri . Edward ate three of them . Then they drove up to the palace courtyard , where , to their surprise , five large cars were parked . " Maybe the Farnese still live here , " said Edward . He got out and ran around to open her door , getting what he wanted  --  a good view of her legs which he had so happily stroked the night before and with which he planned to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the property of the Farnese , but of an outfit called Royal Films which was right-then-and-there making a film about Napoleon 's sister , Pauline . In fact , said the lady custodian , La Lollobrigida was in the garden at this very moment , with about a hundred other people , the implication being that they were trampling the lawns entrusted to her care by Rome , Edward 's disappointment at this invasion of his discovery was mollified ; he bought the tickets of admission ravenous for a view of The Lollobrigida . For an hour , then , he and Vicky leaned against a wall while prop men arranged shrubs as a background for the cameras which finally ground away at a woman in green velvet and gold plumes cavorting on a tranquilized stallion over the undefended lawns . Edward 's eyes strained with avidity , until a Napoleonic extra said the cavorter was only The Lollobrigida 's contrafigura ; The Lollobrigida herself was off in a corner , where , indeed , Edward and Vicky saw her in a duplicate of the gold plumes , probably pining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late to satisfy her . Not until they were hack on the Via Cassia , Edward 's stomach thunderous with hunger , did they realize that they had n't gone inside the ch  --  teau . In Viterbo , they ate in a vaulted trattoria called Spacca . " It means ' split , ' I think , " he said . " I 'm ready to , " and staggered out under the weight of lasagne al f orno , viten() arrosto , piselli , patate , formaggio , and frutto . " How is it you 're not fat ? " asked Vicky , a little aghast at his large body heaving for breath under the black sport shirt , his head sweating more from the working interior than from the roaring , stupefying one o'clock sun . " Nature . I do n't help it . It 's great camouflage for gluttons . I 'm really pretty hard , " and he suppressed the afterword , " You 'll soon see . " He asked directions for the Duomo , and they " Teeth , Dying , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's next volume ( of stories , articles , and a play ) which will be published in the fall . Mr. Stern is associate professor of English at the University of Chicago and the author of " Golk " and other novels . 70 ORVIETO DOMINOS , I3OLSENA EELS .. . drove the closed-in , cobbled streets of the medieval quarter until they saw it in a fine little piazza , flanked by a palazzo with a Gothic loggia and a half-zebra-striped campanile to the left . They parked in front of the palazzo , which , said Edward , was where the people of Viterbo locked up the cardinals in 1270 to see if hunger would force them to end two years of indecision and choose a Pope . " Did it work out ? " " Gregory the Tenth . Hunger 's a great persuader , " and he helped her out , filling up again on her legs . " We 're parked right where Hadrian the Fourth , the only English Pope , Nicholas 13reakspear ? . " It rhymes , " said Vicky . , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stirrup . " In the trattoria , Edward had reread Baedeker in the toilet and was more primed than usual . Though for sight-seeing he was always primed . It was serious work if you did it right . The night before , he 'd looked up the appropriate quotations in Dante and written them into the end pages of the Baedeker , starring them to correspond with the text . This was , in a sense , payment for Vicky 's companionship , the entrance fee to what he would later guide her to , the self-discovery of ovemaking . An old lady sitting on a chair outside the Duomo drew a six-inch key from her dress , opened the door , and led them inside . it was the first Gothic church Vicky had seen in Italy , and after three weeks of baroque Roman churches , where every chapel , every inch seemed to be straining for independent beauty , the stripped-down masterfulness of the high , proud nave made her fee high and proud herself . Edward too was hushed , and forgot about Guy de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread was being elevated at the altar . He followed the old woman , listening to her devoted , unmechanical talk about the dates of the church , the Mantegna , and the frescoes uncovered by the bombing in ' 44 , which looked like broken bodies issuing from graves for the Last Judgment . A believer in nothing , Edward was still a lover of churches  --  like the Romans who , the man at Portinari Drive-Yourself had told him , " manufacture the faith which is believed elsewhere . " On the way out of Viterbo they stopped fifteen minutes at the Musco and looked at the Etruscan sarcophagi and pottery . " They 're so calm about death , " said Vicky . " Maybe that 's what they lived for , to teach other people how to die . " Edward , a little annoyed at the rhetoric , said there were too many signs of the good life found in their tombs , and pointed to what she had missed , a couple playing with each other 's nakedness , etched finely on the black back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live to the full that you can die well , " he said , preparing her for the evening with this rhetorical turn of his own . Which she suspected , but the way things were , seeing so much commemorated life , she could take in stride what was to come , She would be calm and intelligent , equipped , like an Etruscan , with her curled-up lily corresponding to the little plate they carried in their stone hands on which there was a piece of stone fruit for the death god . They 'd planned to swim in Lake Bolsena , partly because of something in Dante , but Edward had missed the turnoff because he 'd followed a sign to Montefiascone , and they 'd gone up for a bottle of what Baedeker called " the best muscatel in Italy . " The bottle had the " Est , Est , Est " motto on it , said Edward , because of a valet who 'd been sent ahead by his master to test the best wines and mark " Est " on the inn doors where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it three times , and his master stayed and died there . It was a happy indirection ; the main road to Orvieto could not have been more beautiful . They were haying in the fields , and oxen drew wagons full of the golden stuff along the road . Now and then , they passed country versions of the papal loggia where people talked and drank among white hens nit of the sun . Vicky felt queerly ashamed to be so free , so easily motorized , with no mission but sight-seeing and the diffused expectation of love . Edward , too , was half enchanted by the heat , the wine , the sense of this blonde girl feeling it with him , driving easily through the flaming , delicate hills cultivated to the last inch by a people articulate not in the mouth , but in gesture and posture . Half an hour from Montefeascone , the Fiat crawled through the medieval , the Roman , the Etruscan walls into the skinny , cobbled ways of Orvieto , going in second , dodging men , women , children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little piazzas , by chocolate and gray palazzi , and then , following the arrows , arriving at the Duomo in front of the astonishing facade , gold , blue , rose , all the colors of the road and fields , sculpted , assembled , " the most beautiful polychromatic monument in the world , " said Baedeker , a gorgeous face for the tremen-dous black-and-white-striped body roaring back of it . " My God , " said Vicky . Among the other tourists and cars and buses and the postcard shops , and the soldiers and the Orvietians , they stared at the dazzling front . Edward read out the description in Baedeker , the commissioning of the church by Urban the Fourth after the " miracle of Bolsena , " the appearance of drops of blood on the bread consecrated by a doubting Bohemian priest . " 1263 . The Feast of Corpus Domini . " A great bell sounded in the square , five thirty . On a tower , a bronze man struck a bell with a bronze hammer . " But how darling , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Edward , touched . She pointed to the bronze man . " Is n't this the nicest place you 've ever seen , Eddy ? I think I could live here forever . " " It is especially nice , " said Edward . " Let 's go see the Signorellis while it 's still light , " and he took her bare arm against his own half-bare one , and walked up the steps , and through the central portal . " I thought it would be bigger . " Edward had a book of the Signorellis back home in New York . He sat back under the portrait of Dante , his head against the signature " Mario e Domenicho ' 48 , " took out his black-and-silver opera glasses , and studied one section of the great frescoes at a time , smiling when he saw familiar figures , the young man with arms on hips , the prostitute with hand out for money , the woman riding the devil 's back toward the pileup of the damned . Edward 's favorite sections were those filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the blue-and-yellow-striped pants of the young man , the plumed hats , the bulging brown money sacks . Edward 's book was only black-andwhite . It was the surprise of Signorelli 's colors that thrilled him most , and the color was strongest in the narratives of life . On the side of the left wall was Signorelli himself , standing in black with the church 's treasurer , thoughtful and a little surprised at what he 'd created . Never in his life had Edward been so absorbed by painting . He even forgot about Vicky , who , though very happy in the lovely chapel , and particularly taken with the sweet , strong blues in Fra Angelico 's sections , was getting neck-weary . " I think the light will be better in the morning , " she said . " Ten minutes more , " said Edward . " Why do n't you see what 's in the other chapel ? And tell me , so I do n't have to see it . " And his eyes were back in the opera glasses.a story by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not see what was in the other chapel , and did not see Vicky again either , except for the thirty seconds when she ran in , breathless and wild , to whisper , shatteringly , " It 's The Group . The Group ! I had to tell ' cm I came on my own , and I 've got to go back with them . Now , " And then , as his insides broke up , she blew him a kiss , and he watched through the opera glasses as his lovely blonde girl joined the bunch of weary sheep following a dark , gabbing female up the great nave and out the central portal of the cathedral . Head in his hands , Edward shook it back and forth until he realized that he was becoming an object of touristic concern . He clicked shut the glasses and headed out after The Group . Maybe she 'd get away from them . Rut where would they meet ? The car ? Or in the Signorelli chapel ? She 'd said the morning light would be better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the piazza in time to see the fat , idiotic backside of the blue bus waddling off down the street . " Holy God , " said Edward . " They 're probably off for Siena . " He touched some holy water to his perspiring head . " No . Not that . They 're off to a hotel , and she 'll be back . Yes . " With this , Edward felt a little better . Also hungry , nervously hungry . He asked one of the piazza-loungers if there were a decent hotel nearby , and got directed to a small albergo . His room on the top floor looked out on the upper left transept of the Duomo , topped by a small bell , and peppered with five small gargoyles ; beyond , in haze , were the violet hills of Umbria . It was the nicest hotel room he 'd ever stayed in ; eighteen hundred lire , three dollars ' worth of irreplaceable niceness . Edward lay back on the beautiful double bed , the ma irimoniale which would have been his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a night without Vicky . After all , he 'd lasted twenty-five years without her . Considering that seven weeks ago he 'd been at a desk thirty-five floors up in the thunder of New York , his head screaming with burdens , he was pretty lucky , with or without her . He dressed and went out to find a restaurant . People were going home along the mocha streets , and Edward walked among them , taking the wall against the cars , bikes , and Vespas which snaked in and out of the road . Dusk came in like a man happy to be home from work , and lights flicked on in houses . Orvieto . It had been a great city in the Etruscan League , Volsinii . Now it had nothing but 74 ORVIETO DOMINOS , BOLSENA EELS .. . lace , wine , postcards , and fifteen thousand people walking the chocolate corridors , smiling . Mostly smiling . The people at the albergo , the padrona , the waiter , the maid , all smiled with especial sweetness . Did the town make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful in an evening gown of spotlight . Its steps were crowded with soldiers  --  it must be a base  --  mothers and children , young men . Edward went across to a restaurant terrace in the piazza , faced the facade , and ordered a mezzo-litro of Orvieto , pasta , eggplant Parmigiano , and roast beef Bolognese . At the other occupied table , three soldiers gorged while he waited tensely for his own parade of marvels , which , when they came , he consumed in a frenzy of bliss under the rouged holy beauty and the crescent moon . The cost was two-and-a-half dollars : maybe one could spend a life in Orvieto , Did the Duomo need an up-and-coming , an up-and-been PR man ? A group of soldiers came along , singing , saying something or other about ragazze . Edward heaved himself down the piazza , through the cobbled streets of the town . In a large square faced by two palazzi , he heard some loud talk , turned and saw a huge spool of film feeding a movie projector , He understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " mangiare , " " displace . " A white cat walked by , striped by the bars of the staircase . Edward walked out of the square , down two still streets , then , in a third , saw fifteen faces , mostly elderly people , craned toward a boxed light in a corner of a bar : Edward recognized the mock-heroic tune which introduced Carosello , Channel One 's evening collectionof commercials . Further up , four soldiers , and two girls giggling at them . More streets , the same streets , and , now and then , the voices of Carosello crashing out of a window . Back at the Duomo Edward saw about ten young men , four of whom were sitting on the black and white steps playing an accordion , a guitar , a cow bell , and a rattle . The song was called " Domino , Domino , " and Edward thought the words were something Eke " Domino . Domino , you 're the one thing I have in the world , dear . Domino , Domino , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the middle of the song , the ten-thirty bells from the bronze man 's hammer sounded , filling out a guitar chord . The six men around the musicians were motionless with attention , fixed as those figures in the frescoes fifty yards away from them . Edward went to the staircase that led from the piazza toward his albergo and sat in the shadow , listening to the songs , the only noise in the square : " Jealousy , " " Volare , " " Begin the Beguine , " " It pleat dans man coeur . " Two of the young men broke the circle with " Ciao . " Then two others . " Do n't leave , boys , " hoped Edward . What else was there ? Walled up in the little town , the three movies seen , fired of Carosello , without girls . Not unlike New York , really , except that there the noise disguised the situation . It was clearer in Orvieto , pathetically clearer . That was the difference . With another : in New York there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's been done , boys . We 've reached it . Peddle your postcards , and go on home . " The town bad stopped around " the great-est polychromatic monument in the world " and the " great milestone in the history of painting in Italy . " And what did Signorelli 's frescoes have to tell the boys ? That they would be judged , here and now , before and later , playing " Domino , Domino , " peddling postcards , driving Fiats , judged with everyone else according to the absolute , black-and-white standards of the Giudizio Unisensate . Bell , accordion , rattle , guitar , the notes , watered down and moved single-file , like the cranes in Dante flying toward the Nile . The musicians , the soldiers , Edward , needed Vickys , love , opportunity , cars , chances to get out of the walled-in city . Unless they were the one-inten million already wise , ready to be judged on the selling of postcards . Signorelli painted himself in a black cloak , and showed his white hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his picture was finely colored , hotly for life , mutely for afterlife , but all colored . Signorelli worked in this little hill town , on his back , straining his neck like the wall-curved figures of his frescoes , three , four , five years , needing nothing else after his days but bed , a bottle of the local wine , maybe now and then a girl . One in ten million . When the guitarist got up , so did Edward . He went to his room , washed , and got . into the matrimoniale as the great hell sounded midnight , followed by two dings of the cathedral bell , unsynchronized with it . " Vicky , " said Edward . His body felt hollower than any bell . And hers ? Was it waiting in some Sienese albergo for his body clapper to sound it ? A bad night . The watchtower clock , the bronze bells , and his need , unslakable by pillow . He did n't sleep till two-thirty , and then woke at six to the sound of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went over to the Duomo to see if Vicky was in the chapel . It was closed , and Edward refused the porter 's offer to unlock it . He went down the street to a bar for an espresso and pastry , then drove off , his insides thunderous for food , and stopped at the first trattoria on the road where he ate six rolls , with butter and jam , and drank two cups of caffelatte . Replete , he was back in the white beetle and heading up the dazzling road toward the Lago del Bolsena where he 'd take a swim before going on to Rome . Two nights ago , for Vicky , he 'd written down the quotation from Purgatory , XXIV , about Pope Martin the Fourth , whose face was more a story by Richard G. Stern 75 transformed by diet than any other of the Canto 's gluttons : Ebbe la santa Chiesa in le sue braccia ; Dal Torso fu : e purge per dioiuno L'anguille de Bolsena e la vernaceia . Martin of Tours , who had the Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did without his beloved Bolsena eels cooked in white wine . He took his Hawaiian trunks from the glove slot , got a cabin for fifty lire , hung his shirt , slacks , and underdrawers over a sign about swimming three hours " dopo pasta , " put on his suit , which his sister said made him look like a pineapple , and walked into the marshy , leguminous lake . Off to the right was the island where , Baedeker reported , Amalsuntha , Queen of the Goths , the only daughter of Theodoric the Great , was imprisoned in 534 and afterwards strangled whilst bathing by order of her cousin Theodatits , whom she had elevated to the rank of co-regent . Edward went in the water , finely cool , and swam his perfect , boy's-camp crawl , fifty feet out , or forty beyond the furthest Italian swimmer . To his left was the other island , where Baedeker placed King Donough O'Brien 's surrender to the Pope in 1064 . " That 's not for me , " said Edward . He headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further , he felt a fire shoot through his stomach . He grunted with pain , clutched his stomach , and doubled over . Cramps . Sweat poured off his head . He stopped moving , sank , moved a foot and an arm , tried to turn over on his back and failed , sweat pouring into the lake water , his head ripping . He let himself go all the way down , knees to his chest , was cooled by the water , touched the oozing bottom , stood on one leg , then hopped a step toward shore , doubled up again , sank , touched bottom , hopped again , sank once more , aching , straightened , and hopped once more , nausea rising in his stomach and throat , irresistible . He turned his face from shore , toward King Donough O'Brien 's island , and vomited into the lake . His throat loosened , soured , he sank in the water , the pain lessening . He kicked , slowly , and slowly , his insides rancid , walking , hopping , swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotted gluttony of the days , he made toward the little beach . After an hour 's rest , he took off his trunks and removed the sport shirt and slacks from the sign about " not swimming till three hours after eating . " " Signs , " he grunted . " I ought to pay attention to these damn signs . "
