txt  | tory one ? " but , rather , " Given that it is his soup which he is seeing , is he in a position to tell , on visual grounds alone , whether there is a bug in it ? " There are countless subtleties on this basic theme . To take the last example , we should notice that it is quite a different thing to " see that there is a bug in your soup " than it is to " see that it is a bug that is in your soup . " For the latter statement tells us only how the percipient identified what was in his soup as a bug rather than , say , a noodle or a mushroom ; the former statement tells us , in addition , how the percipient discovered that there was something in his soup . For example , it would be easier for a person given over to eidetic imagery of a rather vivid sort ( mental images projected onto the normal surroundings ) to see that it was a bug that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that there was a bug in his soup . The former claim does not tell us how he knows that he is seeing something in his soup while the latter claim does tell us this . In my efforts to make a point , I may have created a misleading impression . I certainly do not wish to dispute that people make mistakes , and that sometimes they do not know that which their perceptual claims imply they know . I only wish to urge that many of these mistakes are irrelevant to a proper epistemological evaluation of whether people possess the talent to discover , and hence know , that something is so in virtue of seeing that it is so . Consider the following : S : The captain is very young indeed . R : What makes you say that ? S : I can see that he is ; just look at him ! R : That is the porter , not the captain . S : Oh , my wife told me he was the captain . If we expand S 's second statement into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a very young man " we might want to ask whether this statement is true or false . In one respect it is clearly false ; the captain is not ( let us say ) a very young man , and so S could scarcely be right in saying that he sees that he is very young . Still , the fact remains that the increment in knowledge which S alleges himself to have acquired by visual means is an increment which he can easily bridge and , in the present case , is actually bridging with respect to that fellow over there ( the porter ) . This sort of mistake has no bearing on whether S can  | see whether a man is young or not ; it simply shows that in this particular case the man he saw to be young was not who he thought it was . But since he never said that he could see that that man was the captain ( although he might have believed he could see this ) , his mistake does not infect that portion of his claim which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest to epistemology , but not to the epistemology of perception ? visual perception . Consider another case : S : I see that this water is frozen already . R : That is glass , not water . S : Oh really ! Why is there glass in this tray and water in all the rest ? In this case we might want to say that S 's perceptual claim is a nonstarter . His mistake is real enough , but , once again , this kind of mistake does not reflect adversely on his capacity to achieve visually what he purports to have achieved visually . S is quite able to see , in such circumstances as now prevail , whether water is frozen or not . He is quite able to bridge the gap he thinks he is bridging ( and says he is bridging ) ? the gap between " this is water " and " this water is frozen . " He is simply not starting from where he thinks he is starting . But the responsibility for being at the correct starting point is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on his sense of sight . The responsibility rests with his total information-gathering resources : his intellect , memory , powers of inference , and other senses . To suppose that such mistakes show something about the epistemological inadequacy of his ( or our ) visual powers is like concluding that our center forward is inadequate because , and only because , our team keeps losing . I have not addressed myself to the question of whether those bits ( increments ) of information which our perceptual reports do imply were acquired by visual means can , in fact , be acquired on distinctively visual grounds alone , whether we can justifiably go from " this is water " to " this water is frozen " on visual grounds alone as the locution " sees that the water is frozen " would suggest . This is another question entirely . I think it can be answered ( affirmatively ) to the satisfaction of a sceptic , but it would require a much longer paper . All I have been attempting to argue here is that questions of the sort " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not be a clever imitation ? " are irrelevant to the question of  | whether we can see that water is frozen and that the piece of fruit is a tomato . And , more significantly , the query " Could n't you be hallucinating ? " is irrelevant to whether I can see that this or that is a table , pencil , or my own left hand in a straightforward visual manner . One final caution about the completeness of my argument . I have concentrated heavily on first person , present tense reports of what is seen . Further complications arise when we move to third person reports and past tense statements . When I say of S that he saw that the water was frozen , I certainly suggest that he knew that it was water that was frozen , but we occasionally take considerable liberties with this associated " suggestion . " He may not have known it was water ; he may only have identified is as a liquid of some sort . Still , even knowing this , I may say that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this or not will depend on several factors , one of the most important being the ease with which my listeners are able to identify what it is that S saw to be frozen . Comparable flexibility is available in first person reports when they are in the past tense . But I am convinced that an extended analysis of this variability will only tend to support the point I have been urging throughout this paper : that a vast number of , perhaps all , perceptual reports which tell us how a person discovered something tell us only how he discovered a small piece of that information which the perceptual report implies that he possesses . And to the question of whether we can acquire these pieces of information in the manner described , many of the traditional sceptical considerations are simply irrelevant .  | Professor Dretske 's main positive thesis concerns the relation between perception and knowledge implied in what he calls our commonsense perceptual claims . In connection with his analysis of this relation he says , ... I think my main point is of the utmost importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the validity . . . of our commonsense perceptual claims , as philosophers are wont to do , then we must be quite clear as to what is and what is not being claimed in our ordinary perceptual reports . The philosophers Dretske has in mind are those who have raised what seem to be sceptical questions about our common knowledge . Thus he attributes special importance to his analysis of our commonsense perceptual claims in terms of its relation to the sceptical considerations of traditional epistemology . My comments will be mainly concerned with this relation , and I will follow Dretske in paying particular attention to the traditional appeal to the hallucination possibility . The main types of commonsense perceptual claims dealt with by Dretske are identifications and characterizations . He says that the hallucination possibility is irrelevant to such claims . Near the end of his paper he suggests that this possibility may be irrelevant to all of our commonsense perceptual claims . I will begin with a quick review of some of the difficulties that seem to stand in the way of a straightforward assessment of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us anything about that appeal to the hallucination possibility which transforms it into a " traditional sceptical consideration . " Instead he only cites  | such sentences as " Could n't you be hallucinating ? " But we do not use such sentences as this only in philosophy . We also use such sentences in ordinary epistemic situations . The fact is , I think , that a great many commonsense claims are , in certain circumstances ( and quite apart from any philosophical reflection ) , open to doubts based on the hallucination possibility . From our commonsense point of view , of course , the circumstances must either be known or reasonably suspected to be quite special before we can properly appeal to this possibility by way of raising a doubt . And most of the situations within which we ordinarily find ourselves neither contain nor can reasonably be thought to contain circumstances of the sort required to legitimize appeal to this possibility . But this in no way implies that the number of claims which in one situation or another would be open to the hallucination doubt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation in which the hallucination possibility could be appealed to in raising doubts will be a claim that is open to the hallucination doubt . Consider , for example , the following claim and perceptual basis report : " There is a robin in the oak " ; " I can see that , there is a robin in the oak . " Now in most situations in which one might make that claim on that basis there would be no question raised at all . In some situations a question might arise as to whether the person really knows that it is a robin in the oak . And here a person might answer by saying that he knows robins when he sees them or that he can tell it is a robin because he can see that it has a red breast , etc . And in some situations we might question the person 's claim by raising the possibility that he is hallucinating . For example , suppose that he has said that there is a robin in the oak and that he can see that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can not see any bird whatsoever in the tree . Further , I have reason to believe that he has recently been experimenting with drugs that sometimes have hallucinatory side effects . So I say to him : " I ca n't see any bird there at all ? maybe you 're just hallucinating one . " Now suppose that he in fact had been taking those drugs and that he looked at me as I spoke to him and that when he looked back up to the tree he could no longer see any bird there . Now he is in doubt . He is unable either definitely to rule out this possibility or establish that he had suffered an hallucination . Now he just shakes his head and says : " I  | do n't know whether there was a robin there or not . I might have been hallucinating . I just do n't know . " Now this commonsense perceptual claim would most often be made in circumstances in which no one would think of worrying about hallucination . In most situations we have no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it unreasonable to try to raise a doubt by appealing to that possibility . But circumstances could exist in which it would simply be commonsense to worry about that possibility . And if , in those circumstances , the possibility could not be ruled out then that claim would have to be abandoned or at least reduced to an expression of belief . And there are , of course , a huge number of such claims . Further , in the case described , there was no hint of philosophy . The case was one in which the hallucination possibility was appealed to in an ordinary or commonsense way ? not in a philosophical way . Thus I am led to think that the generalization of Dretske 's view must be wrong as regards ordinary appeals to the hallucination possibility . There are many commonsense perceptual claims to which the hallucination possibility is not " simply irrelevant . " Dretske 's view , however , might not be wrong as regards philosophical appeals to this possibility . Perhaps all philosophical appeals are " simply irrelevant " to our commonsense claims . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thus very difficult to decide whether and to what degree what Dretske says is or is not true . Next , when we turn from " existential " claims such as " I see that there is a robin in the oak " to Dretske 's main examples of straightforward identificatory and characterizational claims we run into an analogous difficulty . Has he shown that philosophical appeals to the hallucination possibility are irrelevant to such claims ? Or has he shown only that ordinary appeals to this possibility are irrelevant to such claims ? Apart from a discussion of the distinction it is very hard to tell . My belief is that he argues only the irrelevance of the ordinary appeal . Now suppose that his claim of irrelevance is correct in this connection . What would this show us about the force of the philosophical appeal to this possibility ? Again it is very hard to tell . Everything would depend on how Dretske would bridge the gap between the ordinary and the philosophical appeals . My guess is that his arguments  | implicitly rely on a linking premise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be challenged by an ordinary appeal to the hallucination possibility then no claim of its form can be challenged by any type of appeal to that possibility . If this conjecture is correct then we could formulate Dretske 's general method as follows : One first shows that commonsense claims with a certain form ( e.g. , identifications with a " that " clause ) are , in virtue of that form , immune to challenge by ordinary appeals to the hallucination possibility . Second , one generalizes this result through the previously mentioned sort of premise . If this is his method , then it clearly has some substantial limitations , for as noted above there are types of commonsense perceptual claims that can be directly challenged by ordinary appeals to the hallucination possibility , and if there are such claims then the linking premise becomes inoperative and the possibility remains that the generally undermining sceptical appeal to the hallucination possibility may also be in order . I have placed a great deal of weight on the idea that we can distinguish between ordinary and philosophical appeals to the hallucination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some difference here , but this does not mean it is easy to set out and describe the difference . I will now try to indicate the kind of difference I see . My account will be both rough and intuitive . To do the job correctly would require a degree of detailed analytic understanding that would take many pages for its presentation and that , in any case , I do not yet possess . Further , I will not discuss all of the ways in which the difference I am concerned with might be brought out . Instead I will concentrate on bringing out the difference as it appears when epistemologists cast their thoughts in the form of philosophical certainty inquiries . ' I. The epistemologist 's basic subject matter is our common ( shared and unspecialized ) knowledge of ordinary public objects . His initial reflection on this dimension of our common knowledge discloses the following two propositions as being of fundamental importance : ( i ) There exist a great many public objects , the most important of which are physical or material wholes. ( ii ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten paragraphs has been suggested to me by the work of Professor Thompson Clarke of the Berkeley philosophy department . I am not suggesting , however , that what I say in these sections is at all an adequate reflection of his work .  | public objects ? most importantly those which are physical or material wholes such as tables and chairs ? but also many which are not such wholes , e.g. , explosions , shadows , flashes , etc. 2 . A metaphysician or conceptual analyst ( for example , P. F. Strawson in his book Individuals2 ) would construe these two propositions as propositions that express certain fundamental facts about our conceptual apparatus . A philosopher of this type would speak about how these propositions tell us something important about how we think or conceive of ourselves and the world around us . He would not look upon these propositions as expressing anything about our beliefs . Even a speculative metaphysician who rejected these propositions would not reject them as expressing false or unsubstantiated beliefs . An epistemologist , on the other hand , would think about these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He does this by conceptualizing these propositions in epistemic terms . He represents the first proposition as something we know and represents the second proposition as providing grounds for this knowledge . " We know that there exist public , physical objects because we can see and touch them . " 3 . Neither of these propositions directly enters into our ordinary claims . We do not , in common life , ever try to establish the general claim that there exist physical things . Rather , we work against a background in which the existence of public , physical things is unquestioned ( except in particular cases ) . Our explicit claims are only about the existence of this or that particular item . It is a matter of determining whether or not some place identified in connection with a whole " matrix " of physical items is " filled " by some further physical item . 4 . Thus the epistemologist sees these propositions as expressing our implicit and implied beliefs . His epistemic characterization of these propositions takes the following , well-known form : " We all believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can know that there exist public , physical objects and that we can know there are such objects because we can see , touch , and otherwise perceive them . " By casting these basic propositions in epistemic terms ? terms whose very meaning is essentially connected with our activities of making and investigating claims to knowl2 ( London , 1959 ) . I have in mind his work in chapter I of this book , especially the first part of that chapter and his remarks on p. 30 about public points of reference .  | edge and certainty ? the epistemologist prepares the way for his certainty inquiry as an investigation of our " underlying beliefs . " 5 . Given this general perspective the epistemologist proceeds to his specific inquiry by working with some paradigmatically normal perceptual situation , that is , a situation which can be used both as an example and as a test case because it is paradigmatically normal ( " best possible " ) . The situation might be that of himself holding and looking at some sheets of paper ( Descartes ' ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a tomato ( Prices ) . Thus , for example , I might turn to a nearby object and say , " Now I surely know there is a typewriter here for I can see it here before me now . " Now once one has inserted the conceptual structure of making a claim and providing a basis , one is committed by the nature of that structure to an investigation . There is nothing philosophical about this commitment . As Austin pointed ottt in connection with ordinary cases , once one has said , " I know , " then one is open to the question " How do you know ? " and committed to defending what one says against objections . ' In this case the fact that the claim is existential and that the grounds were perceptual makes the possibility of delusive perception a natural objection . Thus the philosopher may raise to himself the possibility that he is only hallucinating . Here the crucial fact is that he does not raise this possibility in connection with any of the sorts of factors that would ordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine that other people do not see the typewriter or that he has been taking drugs or anything of that sort . The most he will do is remind himself that people do sometimes hallucinate and that , of course , is not a reason for thinking one is here and now hallucinating . Further , the epistemologist could not raise this possibility in connection with any of the usual special factors , for if he did then his situation would cease to be paradigmatically normal and thus would lose its power of disclosing any general truth . ( The generalization of the epistemologist 's insights is not provided through an inductive enumeration of ' Descartes , Meditations on First Philosophy , Meditation I. 4Bertrand Russell , The Problems of Philosophy ( New York , 1959 ; first published in 1912 ) , pp. 7-9. 5H . H. Price , Perception ( London , 1932 ) , p. 3. 6J . L. Austin , " Other Minds , " reprinted in Philosophical Papers ( London , 1961 ) , pp. 45-46.  | many cases but rather is provided by the paradigmatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 . Thus , within the structure of his inquiry the epistemologist will find himself required to consider , for example , the hallucination possibility quite apart from any special reason for thinking that he may actually be hallucinating . He is thereby forced to make this possibility real to himself apart from any such reason . This is the single most difficult part of his inquiry . He must see how he could here and now be hallucinating . To succeed in this is to realize how one could have just this perceptual experience and yet be hallucinating . And so , once one realizes how this is possible , one also realizes that there are no " certain marks " and that one can not , here and now , be certain that there is , for example , a typewriter present . This represents the episternic or sceptical upshot of the hallucination inquiry . 7 . The next move in this inquiry is for the epistemologist to ask himself , " What then can I be certain of ? " and the only answer available is " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see just those colors and shapes . " This is the perceptual upshot of the hallucination inquiry . It expresses the sense-datum thesis of perception . 8 . It is essential to see that this sense-datum thesis is not presupposed by this inquiry but rather is a result of this inquiry . Once this result is attained it is then possible to invoke the argument from illusion to prove that what one here sees is a private and not a public item . This " argument " attains its aim in basically the following way : " Now fix your attention on those colors and shapes about which alone you are now certain . Notice that as you move around the typewriter those colors and shapes change . Notice also that no one else would at any moment see just that distribution of colors and shapes that you see at this moment . " 9 . Thus the hallucination inquiry ( a particular instance of what we might call " the argument from delusion " ) brings us to fix our attention on the " common-sensuous element " in perception by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallucinating . The argument from illusion consists in a subsidiary set of instructions that , when followed , shows us that this " common-sensuous element " we have already identified is private . At this point we reach the full significance of the philosophical appeal to the hallucination possibility . It ( a ) throws doubt upon  | the first proposition ( that there exist public , physical items and that we can know this ) and ( b ) entirely rejects the second proposition ( that we see public items ) . ( That many epistemologists decide to reserve the expression " see " or at least " indirectly see " for use in material object sentences does not conflict with the idea that the second proposition is entirely rejected. ) io . Finally , I would suggest that the philosophical appeal to the hallucination possibility differs from our ordinary appeal to that possibility in these two ways : First , the possibility is raised in connection with a very special sort of claim . The claim is not special in any formal way ? the claim sentence may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a tomato there . " But it is special in that it explicitly is not made against the ordinary background of the known presence of physical things and is intended to func- , tion as a claim that exemplifies this background knowledge . That is , once one has conceptualized propositions ( i ) and ( ii ) of paragraph r in epistemic terms , then they will seem to express assumptions or unquestioned background beliefs , and thus it will seem that the philosopher 's claim will have a different force than that possessed by our ordinary claims of the same form . Second , the possibility is necessarily considered apart from any of those factors that we would ordinarily require before seriously considering this possibility . The epistemologist feels that he must consider this possibility even though he has no reason for thinking he is actually hallucinating and does actually seriously consider this possibility completely apart from any such reason . And here I would stress that we can not find the difference we are looking for by an examination of the situation with which the epistemologist works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language he uses in his inquiry . For the perceptual situation is paradigmatically normal and the general form of his inquiry is the same as that of ordinary inquiries ( e.g. , the one previously given of claiming to know there is a robin in the oak ) , and his language is quite obviously just ordinary language . Let us now return to the job of outlining the difficulties that seem to stand in the way of a direct appraisal of Dretske 's ideas . It is clear , I think , that traditional epistemologists typically appeal to the hallucination possibility when examining existential claims such as " There is a tomato before me now . " Dretske , however , mainly concentrates on identificatory and characterizational claims .  | Thus it is not clear that if we were to agree with him that the hallucination possibility lacks some degree of relevance to these sorts of claims we are directly denying anything alleged by those traditional epistemologists who have insisted on raising the hallucination possibility . In this connection we should remember that traditional epistemologists have also worked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined these claims by appealing to the possibility of delusive perceptual experience . Instead they have here insisted on the possibility of future disconfirmatory observations . Their inquiries have been of the sort described as verification arguments . ( That the hallucination inquiry and the verification argument are importantly different is shown not merely by the differences in claims examined and techniques of examination but also by the differences in their ultimate conclusions . The hallucination inquiry generates the sense-datum thesis about perception , whereas the verification argument shows that our empirical claims are radically predictive in nature . ) Thus , if one were to answer Dretske from the general traditional position which he is opposing , one might say the following : " To attack our position you must either show the irrelevance of the hallucination possibility to existential empirical claims or show the irrelevance of the possibility of future disconfirmatory observation to identificatory and characterizational claims . But you seem to do neither . Rather , you only show the irrelevance of the hallucination possibility to identificatory and characterizational claims . And typically we have not appealed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I now want to turn from these general reflections to a more detailed examination of one of Dretske 's claims . He says that the hallucination possibility is " simply irrelevant " to our identificatory and characterizational claims . This assertion seems to me to be slightly too strong . I think that the most he can assert is that our ability or inability to rule out the hallucination possibility is simply irrelevant to the question of whether we possess the ability to obtain increments in identificatory and characterizational knowledge through visual perception . But typically we do not claim that we possess this ability . Rather we claim for example  | that the bird is a robin or that the robin has certain wing markings . The ability we exercise in making such claims may be untouched by the hallucination possibility , but it is a further question whether our claims will always be untouched by that possibility . Claims are made within situations and what will and will not be relevant to a claim will depend in part on the situation . Now from a commonsense point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a situation has quite special features for it to be reasonable for us so much as to raise the hallucination possibility . The first question , then , is whether a claim can be made in a situation known or reasonably suspected to possess appropriate special features . If it can be made in such a situation then it is a claim which can be reasonably examined in the light of the hallucination possibility . I think that identificatory and characterizational claims can be made in such situations . If this is so , our next question is this : Given such a situation , will a person be required to alter or abandon his identificatory or characterizational claim if he can not rule out the possibility of hallucination in that situation ? Now in some of these situations ( taken from the ordinary point of view ) the person making the claim can rule out the hallucination possibility . Consider this example : You have been working in the garden and have cut some flowers and have brought them into the house . As you were arranging them you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw them away . Later you tell me about the flowers and say that after working with them a few minutes you saw that they were wilted and so threw them away . Also , you tell me that they were violets . I think about this . I know that no violets bloom at this time of year . I also can see that you are in a highly distraught state . And I know that you have been taking drugs which sometimes cause visual hallucinations . So I raise the possibility that you only hallucinated those violets . Here you can " rule out " this possibility in a number of ways . " Violets ? No , they were lilies . " " I have n't taken any drugs in the last six weeks . " " Of course not ? I was working with them in the garden and cut them myself and you know those drugs never cause tactile hallucinations . " " Look , when you do hallucinate something with that drug it is like seeing an afterimage ? you can not look away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those flowers a number of times . "  | In all of these ways the possibility could be ruled out . In each case the possibility is ruled out by rebutting one of the reasons in connection with which the possibility was raised . ( That we ordinarily raise this possibility only in connection with some special reason and only with respect to some limited aspect of the situation is part of what makes it possible for us to " rule out " this possibility in everyday cases . ) In other situations , however , a person might not in fact be able to rule out this possibility . For example , the same person tells me that the violets on the living room table are wilted , that he had looked at them ten minutes ago and had seen that they were . I again raise the hallucination possibility with the same reasons . But this time he insists that they were violets . And this time he had not handled them and had not looked away from them and then back at them . Thus the ways mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Still , the situation is one in which the possibility was raised only in connection with him . So he brings me to the living room to " see for myself . " But we do not find any flowers there . Of course , someone might have discarded them . But it is not at all certain that he did not merely hallucinate them . In this case there is a real doubt . Now in the first case there clearly is no reason for the man to alter his claim . He was , after all , able to rule out that possibility . But can he simply maintain his claim in the second case ? His claim was : " I saw that the flowers were wilted " ; can he justifiably continue to make that claim ? Must he abandon his claim ? Surely he would neither persist in his claim nor abandon it . Rather , he would adjust it . He might say : " Well , I really am not sure there were any flowers there , but if there were then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hallucinated wilted ones . " That is , his claim as a whole must be adjusted , but the " is wilted " part of his claim , as Dretske points out , need not be adjusted . And there is no doubt that he has the ability to recognize wilted flowers when he sees them . But the claim he made can not stand as made . Thus it seems that if we focus on the full claim and the situation within which it is made we must say that if the hallucination possibility can be reasonably raised and can not be ruled out then the claim must be adjusted though not simply discarded . And if this is so then it is not quite correct to say that the hallucination  | possibility is " simply irrelevant " to our claims , not even to our identificatory and characterizational claims . On the other hand , it seems clear that these sorts of claims are not open to full and direct challenge by the hallucination possibility . There is a real difference between the relevance of " You might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oak ? I can see that one is there " and to " The robin in the oak has a broken wing ? I can see that it does . " If one can not rule out the possibility in connection with the existential claim then it is not enough to adjust it ? one must simply abandon it ( perhaps replacing it with an expression of belief ) . Thus it seems that we should say neither that the hallucination possibility is simply irrelevant nor fully relevant to our commonsense identificatory and characterizational claims . Such claims can be indirectly ( but only indirectly ) undercut by the appeal to this possibility . Now thus far we have spoken merely about the relevance of the hallucination possibility as ordinarily appealed to . What about the generalization to the philosophical appeal to that possibility ? If my modification of Dretske 's assertion about the irrelevance of this possibility is correct , then the generalization would take roughly this form : " Even if the hallucination inquiry of traditional epistemology were entirely valid it still would not directly undercut any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existential . " If the epistemologist did work with genuine commonsense perceptual claims as commonly made and understood , then if his inquiry were valid it would follow that at least some of our commonsense perceptual claims can be directly undercut by the hallucination possibility . It therefore becomes critically essential to scrutinize the epistemologist 's hallucination inquiry , for we must now either be able to show that it is not valid or that the claims with which it works are not identical in all respects with our commonsense claims . ' We know that epistemologists often work with existence claims 7The ordinary appeal to the hallucination possibility is only indirectly relevant to identificatory and characterizational claims . Thus one might argue that even the philosophical appeal to the hallucination possibility is only indirectly relevant to them . But the difficult cases concern those claims to which an ordinary appeal to the hallucination possibility is directly relevant . It is in connection with these sorts of claims that the philosophical appeal to the hallucination possibility is most tempting .  | such as " There is a tomato here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of such ordinary claims as " There is a robin in the oak , " " There is a stick over there , " etc . Dretske gives an example of such a claim , namely , " There is a bug in the soup . " Further , epistemologists will initially give their claims a perceptual basis such as " I know there is a tomato there because I can see it . " We here meet that so-called nonpropositional use of " see " that Dretske said he would not discuss . I find it odd that he does not consider this use ( if it is that ) of " see " for , first , it is the use that is central to the traditional hallucination inquiry ( " What kinds of things do we really see ? " ) and , second , it is a very common use in connection with ordinary claims . In many cases if we ask someone how he knows there is a robin in the oak or a tomato on the table or a bug in his soup or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I can see one there . " It is not , after all , just philosophers who formulate their perceptual reports with sentences involving the nonpropositional use of " see . " I believe that one of the main reasons he would give for concentrating on the " see that " construction is that the truth of " He sees that 0 " implies that he knows that 0 . But a discussion of this would lead away from the point at hand and Dretske himself works with " I can see that there is a bug in the soup " and this , at least , does not seem to differ materially from " I see that there is a bug- in the soup . " At this stage , therefore , it seems fairly clear that the sentences used by the epistemologist in setting forth his claim and basis are the same as the sentences we commonly use in setting forth some of our claims and bases . For example : My wife is about to go shopping and she asks me if there are any tomatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of voice , that there are . Knowing me pretty well she asks me if I am quite sure there are . I reply , " Yes , yes , I know there are some left ? I can see them over there on the table . " So if we are to differentiate between the claim that the epistemologist makes and those that we ordinarily make we must look beyond the sentences we employ and their formal features . Further , the perceptual situation within which we might make some perfectly commonsensical perceptual claim may be identical with the perceptual situation considered by the epistemologist . The perceptual situation will be one of a man standing before some public item with his eyes open and focused in the direction of the  | item and with nothing blocking his view , etc . ' That is , the philosopher will work with a paradigmatically normal perceptual situation of the type within which we often make commonsense perceptual claims . Thus the philosopher 's claim not only can not be differentiated in terms of the sentence he employs , it also can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within which he employs it . So what is the difference between the epistemologist 's claim " I know there is a tomato there " and the commonsense claim " I know there is a tomato there " ? We may easily enough be able to sense some difference , but it seems very difficult to describe the difference with precision and in detail and in such a way as not to prejudice either our view of the philosopher 's claim or of the commonsense claim . Now we might want to say that the claims really are identical . If we say this and agree that the philosopher 's appeal to the hallucination possibility ( e.g. , within the framework of the hallucination inquiry described above ) does radically undercut his claim ( e.g. , as made at the beginning of that inquiry ) , then we would have to agree that many of our ordinary claims are radically undercut by this possibility whether or not we acknowledge this in everyday life . So if we say that the claims are identical and still want to argue that our commonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallucination possibility , we will have to show that there is something wrong with the philosophical appeal to the hallucination possibility . But to show this we would have to make some distinction between ordinary and philosophical appeals to this possibility , and Dretske does not draw this distinction . Thus it would seem that we must try instead to discover some difference between the philosophical " I know there is a tomato here because I can see one here " and the commonsensical " I know there is a tomato here because I can see that one is here . " 8The most natural way of indicating a normal perceptual situation is to use the form of words " Here so-and-so sees the tomato . " But to say this is to beg the question of the perceptual status of the things around us . Thus I have tried to indicate indirectly the sort of situation I have in mind by saying , " Nothing is blocking his view , " etc . One might take my " description " as simply a couple of remarks intended to remind you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean to imply that one might be able to pinpoint a normal perceptual situation by ruling out every abnormal feature . There is no " every " here .  | In this way we will follow up on Dretske 's aim of becoming " quite clear as to what is and what is not being claimed in our ordinary perceptual reports " by seeing how what they claim is not exactly what the epistemologist would claim . As mentioned above , the philosopher views his claim sentence as expressing a commonsense belief . By this , however , he does not mean that his sentence expresses exactly the sort of claim it would be used to express in ordinary circumstances . His claim is not one of Dretske 's " commonsense claims . " When the philosopher says , " I know there is a tomato here , " he is presenting his knowledge that a tomato is present as an example of the sort of thing we believe we know . On the other hand , the ordinary claim that a tomato is present does not function as an example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our feeling that if the philosopher 's claim is undercut by the hallucination possibility then there is reason for general doubt . But we do not feel that when some particular , ordinary claim is undercut by the hallucination possibility there is then reason for doubting anything beyond that particular claim . I think Dretske 's remarks reflect this sort of difference in a number of ways . He speaks , for example , of how , in our use of demonstratives , we convey the information that what we point out is " something that you and other people can also see . " ( This is clearly connected with proposition ( ii ) about our perception of public items . ) He also says that the responsibility for our " starting points " rests with our entire information-gathering resources . Our " starting points " are not , in general , questioned , and when in particular circumstances and for special reasons some " starting point " is questioned the questioning does not spread to all " starting points . " If I say , " The flowers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that some flowers were there . Now this might be questioned . But in questioning this ( e.g. , via the hallucination possibility ) it is not questioned that the table is there or that I am speaking with you . Thus other " starting points " are always available ; for example , we can go to the table , you can ask whether I saw some flowers there , etc . ( The " starting points " really form a kind of background matrix of public , physical items against which we make our particular claims . This is connected with proposition ( i ) about the existence of public , physical items . ) In these and various other ways Dretske seems to suggest that  | there is a certain level or dimension of information or common knowledge in terms of which we make our commonsense perceptual claims but which itself never becomes the object of explicit commonsense claims . Our commonsense claim that there is a robin in the oak or a tomato on the table will be made against this sort of background , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or " I can see that one is there " will be entirely satisfactory given ( a ) that we know robins or tomatoes when we see them and ( b ) that there is no special reason for thinking that in this case we have suffered a delusion of sight . ( That is , our perceptual claim will stand , given that there is no reason for thinking that what is generally true about sight ? that it picks up public objects ? does not hold in this case. ? ) In contrast , epistemologists seem to try to crystallize this background into a particular claim and thus produce a claim which can not , as it were , rely on this background . The philosopher represents the whole background with a particular claim ( of a quite ordinary form ) and thus his claim simply is not made against the background . His claim therefore will seem to " probe foundations " in a way that no ordinary claim will and his claim will carry a weight never carried by any ordinary claim . Undoubtedly Dretske would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view . But I think he might agree that what the philosopher tries to claim is far beyond what we ever ordinarily claim . His disagreement with the epistemologist , then , might be of one of these two kinds : ( a ) He might argue that this background information or common knowledge can not be expressed through a claim ( in which case the epistemologist either fails to make any claim or misunderstands the claim he does make ) , or ( b ) he might argue that this background information can be established through our total information-gathering resources in such a way that the hallucination possibility raises no particular difficulty . ? One might put this in terms of a legal metaphor . It is fundamental to our legal system that a man is innocent until proven guilty and that he is not required to defend his innocence until evidence of guilt is presented . Analogously , a man 's perception is of a public object until it is proven that he has suffered a perceptual delusion and he need not defend his claim to see a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented . The prima facie background to the law is that a man is innocent . The prima facie background to common empirical knowledge is ( in part ) that we perceive public objects . This , of course , is only a metaphor .  | Indeed , these two ideas are not exclusive of one another . It might be argued that we must both explore and show the solidity of the foundations of our common knowledge and then criticize traditional epistemology in terms of its attempt to do this in a far too narrowing way ( e.g. , by exploring the foundations through particular claim assessments ) . I think that there are elements of both of these ideas in Dretske 's paper . As mentioned earlier , Dretske speaks of the information conveyed in our use of demonstratives . He clearly is thinking of simple perceptual situations and the information he mentions is that the " that " which the speaker sees and to which he refers is something others can also see , i.e. , it is a public item . This , of course , runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , i.e. , the conclusion that the items an individual sees are private sense-datum items . And as was also mentioned earlier , he concentrates attention on the " see that " locution , a locution of recognition . Thus it is suggested that at least some of our basic " starting points " are established through sight and that sight determines some item of discourse as a public item . We might think of " I see that there is a bug in the soup " as having the force of " I see that and it is a bug and is in the soup " and that it is a bug is given by " I see that it is a bug . " In this way , seeing that there is a bug in the soup will be a matter of sight locating a public item for the " starting point " of some segment of discourse and " seeing that " functioning to identify that public item as a bug . And on this view that some public item is present is not part of what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to make this the basic point of his claim . Of course it is not true that we never , in everyday life , explicitly claim that some public item is present . We can be forced to make this ? which normally is implicit ? explicit in special cases . These would be cases in which there is some reason for thinking we may be suffering a delusion of sight . And to defend the explicit claim that a public item is present the person would then have to rule out the possibility that he is suffering some delusion of sight . But he need not do that in general . The question will be , for example , about the alleged bug but not about the soup and the bowl and the napkins and his fellows at the table , etc . In these sorts of ways Dretske seems to suggest that none of our commonsense perceptual claims , even the most explicitly existential ones , claims exactly what the philosopher would want to claim .  | On the other hand Dretske also speaks of our total informationgathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relations and functions of all of the senses and of memory and intelligence and inference , etc. , then we shall see that the background of common knowledge against which we typically operate is entirely secure and either has been or can be put on a philosophically firm footing . Perhaps the main difficulty with both of these lines of thought is due entirely to the fact that Dretske was working under severe limitations of space . Yet the fact is that both lines of thought are barely sketched . The latter line of thought is particularly vague and as presented seems entirely open to a phenomenalist interpretation . And by a " phenomenalist interpretation " I would mean an interpretation that would examine the full range of our information-gathering resources in connection with such " perceptual theses " as that we perceive only sense data , have memory experiences logically independent of the events alleged to be remembered , etc . The former line of thought , on the other hand , seems to require not only the sort of detailed examination of our cornmonsense claims given by Dretske @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traditional epistemology . And this would require step by step comparisons of the claims examined by philosophers and the claims we commonly make ; of the perceptual situations common to both philosophical and commonsense claims ; of the contexts in which claims are made in and out of philosophy ; of the different ways in which the hallucination possibility functions in philosophical and commonsense examinations of claims , etc . For it seems to me likely that , short of knowing exactly and in detail what is going on when a philosopher submits our common knowledge to sceptical examination , no amount of careful scrutiny of ordinary claims could hope to show that the philosopher 's sceptical considerations are " simply irrelevant . " And , more important , nothing short of this sort of examination could hope to prove that the ultimate sensedatum thesis of the hallucination inquiry is incorrect .  | Here is a muddled argument that some people find persuasive : Suppose S , in telling us how he knows that the piece of fruit on the table is a tomato , avows that he can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all know , a tomato is the sort of thing which other people can see , touch , and eat ; it is juicy and has a distinctive taste . It is , indeed , quite a different thing from an hallucinatory tomato or a wax imitation . Clearly , then , if S does know that it ( what he sees ) is a tomato , he must know that it is not merely a wax imitation , not merely a figment of his own imagination . And if he knows this in virtue of seeing that it is so ( as he says ) , then he must be able to see that it is not an imitation , not merely some visual delusion . Surely , however , he can not do this . In a spirit of generosity we might concede that he knows it is a tomato ( perhaps he poked his finger in it , smelled it , tasted it , and so on ) , but he can not do what he said he did ? see that it is a tomato . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : differentiate , on visual grounds alone , between real tomatoes and their hallucinatory counterparts , between real tomatoes and wax reproductions . He can not do this because , as we all know , hallucinatory tomatoes and imitation tomatoes are just the sort of thing that may be visually indistinguishable from real tomatoes . How can S see that something is a tomato when tomatoes are visually indistinguishable from a variety of nontomatoes ? There is a pattern to this argument and it goes something like this . If S knows that x is a foozit , and he knows this because ( as he says ) he can see that it is a foozit , then he must be able to see that it is not a nonfoozit . If , however , there are nonfoozits which look exactly like the foozits , then S can not ( despite what he says ) see that anything is a foozit . He might know it is a foozit ( by handling it , consulting experts , etc. ) , but he can not see that it is ,  | for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If gin and vodka look the same to me , then I can not see whether the liquid is gin or vodka ( although I may discover which is the vodka by tasting or by listening to the testimony of a reliable informant ) . Likewise , if hallucinatory tomatoes and imitation tomatoes are the sorts of thing which are visually indistinguishable from real tomatoes , then one can not see that something is a real tomato . There is nothing visually distinctive about real tomatoes , nothing that would allow S to identify a real tomato on purely visual grounds as the claim " I can see that it is a tomato " would suggest . It is this type of argument to which my paper was addressed . The fallacy it embodies is of the kind I described . It mistakenly supposes that if something 's being a P entails that it is also Q , then if S sees that something is P ( and , hence , knows that it is P ) , he must also be able to see that it is Q. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if something 's being a tomato entails that it is not an imitation , not some piece of mental imagery , then if S sees that something is a tomato , he must also see that it is not an imitation , not a figment of his own imagination . This is a mistaken inference . When S sees that the piece of fruit is a tomato , there is nothing in his achievement as so described which implies that S ruled out , or was even capable of ruling out , such alternatives on visual grounds , nothing to suggest that he could see that it was a real tomato in contrast to an hallucinatory one , nothing to suggest that there is anything visually distinctive about real tomatoes as compared to wax reproductions . The only demand such an achievement ( as so described ) imposes on S 's visual capacities is that he be able to distinguish , on visual grounds alone , between pieces of fruit which are tomatoes and pieces of fruit which are not tomatoes . And to the question of whether or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever imitations is simply irrelevant ; for wax imitations and hallucinatory figments are not , I take it , to be numbered among the pieces of fruit in this world . It may be helpful to look at the point in this way . Let " p " be the statement " The water in the pot is boiling " and " q " the statement " The liquid in the pot is boiling water . " Suppose we agree that " p " and " q " are logically equivalent . Now , S may succeed in seeing that  | p , but he may be totally unable to see : that q . Why is this so ? Because although " p " and " q " are logically equivalent , they represent different increments of information when embedded in the context " S sees that . . . . " And since the locution " S sees that ... " ( when used to tell us how S knows that . . . ) tells us how S acquired this increment of information ( i.e. , visually ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increment is of crucial significance in understanding what S has done ? even though the resultant piece of knowledge ( " p " and " q " ) is the same ( logically ) in either case . What I tried to argue in my paper was that certain traditional considerations involving hallucinations , fakes , imitations , mirages , reflections , etc. are frequently , though not always , irrelevant to whether a human being can acquire these increments of information by purely visual means . And if these considerations are irrelevant to this matter , they are therefore irrelevant to what we can see to be the case ( and , hence , know to be the case ) since our descriptions of what we see to be the case are descriptions of how we have bridged these increments . Hugly takes me to task for not distinguishing between the ordinary appeal to the " hallucination possibility " and the philosophical appeal . In one respect I think this criticism is a bit unfair ; in another respect it is entirely warranted . I think it unfair because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denying the ( occasional ) relevance of ordinary appeals to the hallucination possibility . I certainly did not wish to suggest that people never suffer hallucinations , nor that when they do they sometimes think they see things ( to be the case ) which are not the case . When my intoxicated companion " sees " orange bugs all over the carpet , we obviously can not dismiss the possibility of hallucination . At least I never entertained such a thought . I only wished to consider the plausibility of a view that takes its cue from such situations and draws conclusions , general conclusions , about the epistemic credentials of ordinary perceptual claims . And the kind of conclusion which has been drawn from a consideration of such cases is that the visual experience which provides the basis for epistemic perceptual claims is conspicuously inadequate to support the implied claims to knowledge . The conclusion is drawn that even when we are not hallucinating , even when it is ( or may be ) a tomato which we see , the associated visual experience is not itself ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying we know that it is a tomato . And since the claim to see that x is a tomato implies that the claimant has discovered x to be a tomato in some distinctively visual fashion , a simple application of modus tollens generates the conclusion that we do not ( ever ) really see that something is a tomato . There is a variety of ways of dealing with this sceptical argument , one of the most fashionable being to insist that we common folk have our own epistemological standards for knowing , and anything that satisfies these standards qualifies as knowledge . We know ( for all practical purposes , and these are the only purposes that are relevant ) that it is a tomato when we see it ( sometimes ) , and never mind about the carping of the epistemologists . Without judging the value of this approach , I have tried to urge an examination of some preliminary matters ; namely , that if we look at what we common folk say we see ( to be the case ) , instead of concentrating on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we describe ourselves as doing is only acquiring a modest portion ( increment ) of that information which the claim itself implies that we possess . What we describe ourselves as having discovered by visual means is ( generally speaking ) only a small piece of that information which our claim itself implies that we have . In a word , what we claim to have done is something which the possibility of visual hallucinations , and very often the possibility of fakes , forgeries , imitations , and reflections , has not the slightest tendency to show can not be done in a purely visual fashion with the highest epistemic credentials . There is another respect , however , in which Hugly 's queries are justified . We often say , " I could see that . . . " or " I can see that . . . , " meaning by this ( as far as I can tell ) nothing different ( when this is understood to be a description of how we know that . . . ) from " I saw that . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In my paper I moved freely back and forth between both modes of expression . Ordinarily this might not have been objectionable , but , with respect to the point I was after , an important ambiguity appears . I wished to argue that the possibility of hallucinatory tomatoes or imitation tomatoes was irrelevant to whether S could see that a piece of fruit was a tomato in the sense of " could " which might be rendered as " has the ability to . " Is the possibility ( let us even say the probability ) of hallucinations or fake tomatoes ( visually indistinguishable from real tomatoes ) relevant  | to whether S has the capacity to know that a piece of fruit is a tomato by seeing that it is a tomato ? Is it relevant to whether S can bridge the increment which such a statement depicts him as bridging ? Hugly correctly points out that my argument only shows that various sceptical considerations are irrelevant to whether we possess this ability . And this , of course , is what I intended to show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing in such considerations which tended to show that there was some fundamental epistemological inadequacy in those situations where we describe ourselves as knowing something to be the case by seeing it to be the case . I admit , though , that my indiscriminate use of " could " and " can " helped to obscure this point . Hugly also wonders why I do not consider the so-called nonpropositional use of the verb " to see . " He finds this odd because , as he says , it is the use which is central to the traditional hallucination inquiry . I do not care for the terminology " propositional " and " nonpropositional , " 1 but since I introduced it let me persevere and indicate why I avoided talking about nonpropositional seeing . Suppose S sees a robin in the oak . Does he know there is a robin in the oak ? Notice , this question is perfectly sensible . Obviously S does not have to identify everything he sees . He also saw fourteen robins , two blue jays , and a crow flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds they were or how many ? No . They flew by so quickly , and they were a hundred yards away . Of course , if S says , " I saw a robin in the oak today , " there is a strong presumption that he saw that it was a robin ? especially if he says this in response to a question such as " How do you know there were any birds in the oak ? " But this is little more than a presumption . A similar presumption operates when he says , " I touched ( ate , shot , stepped on , etc. ) a robin today . " There is nothing about such statements that is of particular epistemological significance . One can touch ( eat , shoot , or step on ) a robin without knowing it is a robin , but our saying such things is significant since it implies ( in some sense ) that we have identified the item in question as a robin . To use another of Hugly 's examples , if my wife calls to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trouble , a difference , the problem , the answer , or what is on the table a " propositional " or " nonpropositional " use of the verb " to see " ?  | whether I am certain that there are any tomatoes left , I can reply in a variety of ways : " Yes , Jim and I are playing catch with them , " " Yes , I just sat on them , " and so on . Does the fact that such utterances function perfectly well as responses to the question " Are you sure ( how do you know ) there are any tomatoes left ? " show that " playing catch with x " or " sitting on x " represent important epistemic relations that we bear to objects ? Of course not . It merely means that , given a reasonably alert adult , such " involvements " with x are sufficiently intimate to justify the assumption that the person involved knows what x is , and this is especially so if x is some familiar object like a tomato . Likewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less normal conditions , close at hand ) he is likely to see what it is ? see that it is a tomato . The nonpropositional use of the verb " to see " is , in an important respect , epistemically neutral . We can see an X without realizing that it is an X. We can also truly say , " I see ( saw ) art X , " without knowing ( without even believing ) that it is ( was ) an X we see ( saw ) . Consider the pickpocket at the bus stop who says , " I see the bus coming , " in order to distract the attention of the people standing with him . He can truly say this ( that distant vehicle he sees is the bus ) without believing it . Seeing an X is like being on the pier when the boat arrives ; although both states of affairs are epistemically neutral , we can answer the question " How do you know there was an X there ? " by saying , " I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question " How do you know the boat arrived ? " by saying , " I was there on the pier when it arrived . " This brings me to the most important point about the nonpropositional use of this verb . Hugly is right when he says that it has played a major role in hallucination inquiries . But this is just the trouble . By conflating " seeing an X " with " seeing that it is an X " one is mistakenly led to suppose that epistemological considerations are relevant to whether we see tomatoes , bugs ( in our soup ) , robins ( in the oak ) , and so on . That is , one will suppose that if there are sceptical arguments which tend to show that we can not know for certain that what we are seeing is a robin in the oak , if we can not see that there is a robin in the oak , then those same arguments tend to show that we do not see a robin in the oak . This ridiculous argument ( preparatory to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the ground if we confuse seeing a robin in the oak with seeing that there is a robin in the oak , if we confuse seeing a tomato with seeing that it is a tomato . Nothing I had to say in my paper was relevant to whether we see tomatoes , bugs , robins , water , or people . Whether people do see such things is as much an epistemological issue as , and no more than , whether people step on bugs , feed robins , drink water , or stand next to people . We can not show that S does not see a robin in the oak because he does not know , or does not believe , that there is a robin in the oak . ( Think of S as a small child . ) We could as well show that S is not standing next to an oak tree because he does not know , does not believe , it is an oak tree . The most that we could show by this is that S has no basis for saying he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any claim S might advance , and it shows nothing distinctive about what it means to see something . The same could be said about his statement " I stepped on an ant today . " It is for the purpose of avoiding this confusion that I concentrated on those perceptual claims which do tell us , explicitly , that the percipient discovered something about what he saw , and discovered it in a distinctively visual manner . There is , finally , the question of existential claims . Hugly is correct in pointing out that I concentrated heavily on what he calls " identificatory " and " characterizational " claims . My excuse is that my point was easier to illustrate in these cases . But I do not think my thesis , the notion that epistemic perceptual claims are always incremental in character , is restricted to identificatory and characterizational nominals , and I tried to indicate this briefly with the example of a bug in the soup . Existential objects of the verb " to see " generally take the form of seeing that there is a so-and-so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , under , following , watching , touching , . . . such-and-such . I saw that there was someone talking to the widow , that there was a robin in the oak , that there was a dog following the man , that there was some money on the table . What I tried to indicate , perhaps with excessive brevity , is that , once again , there is a particular increment embodied in each of these objects of the verb . When S says that he can see that there is a robin in the oak , he has certainly told us how he knows that there is a robin in the oak . But has he told us how he knows that it is an oak that the robin is in ? Must he be able to see that  | the tree is an oak to see that there is a robin in the oak ? No . Presumably , he knows it is an oak ? after all , he did refer to it as an oak ? but he may have learned that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even that it was a real tree ) in a variety of nonvisual ways . His friend may have told him it was an oak . Must one be able to see that a woman is a widow to see that there is someone talking to the widow ? Must I be able to see that it is your bird house ( or a bird house ) to see that there is a robin in ( on , near ) your bird house ? What these rhetorical questions are designed to reveal is that existential objects of the verb also embody an increment of information , an increment which the entire statement describes the percipient as acquiring in a distinctively visual manner . When S tells us that he sees that there is a robin in the oak , S does not tell us how he knows that he is seeing an oak ( a tree , or even a real tree ) . And since he has not told us this , he has not told us how he knows what his perceptual statement implies that he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robin and oak tree ) . In a sense , he has told us how he went from one piece of information , " That is an oak tree , " to another piece of information , " There is a robin in the oak . " 2 There is nothing in S 's achievement as so described which implies that S was able to visually differentiate between a real robin in a real oak tree and an hallucinatory robin in an hallucinatory oak tree , nothing to suggest that he was able to eliminate the possibility of some comprehensive visual delusion in any distinctively visual way ( although his perceptual statement implies that he knows that he is not suffering from comprehensive visual delusion ) . In order to see that there is a robin in the oak S must only 2In some cases , of course , S may not have learned it was an oak until later ; at the time he saw the robin in it he did not know it was an oak . In such cases the actual increment which S bridged in seeing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that reflected by the actual terms which appear in the factive nominal . What term or phrase we select to refer to what we see to be P ( in this case : what we see to have a robin in it ) is affected by several variables , one of the most important being the ease with which our listeners will be able to identify what it is that was seen to be P. There are complexities here which I do not have the space to discuss . I tried to indicate the location of some of these difficulties in the last paragraph of my paper when I mentioned the complications that arise when we turn to reports in the past tense and in the third person . I do not believe , however , that these complexities affect ( adversely ) the point I am trying to make .  | be able to discover , on visual grounds alone , whether this oak tree has a robin in it . And , to the question of whether or not he possesses this capacity , the possibility of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robin and oak tree ) is simply irrelevant . This brings me to the point of my distinction between " seeing that there is a bug in my soup " and " seeing that it is a bug that is in my soup . " Notice the very real difference between these two achievements . Unlike the explicit existential , the latter does not ( even ) tell us how the percipient knows that there is something in his soup ; it only tells us how he discovered that the something in his soup was a bug rather than anything else . To take a concrete case , suppose everyone agrees that there is something in your bird house ; the question remains " What ? " I see nothing overly ambitious in S , a fellow given over to hallucinations and currently under the influence of drugs , seeing that it is a robin that is in the bird house . This achievement demands nothing more from S than the ability to distinguish , on visual grounds , between robins , blue jays , wrens , squirrels , etc. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird house . Hence , S 's tendency to hallucinate birds , snakes , and other strange creatures in the middle of normal surroundings ( eidetic imagery ) does not in the least detract from his ability to see that it is a robin that is in your bird house . For , of course , hallucinatory creatures are not in real bird houses . Hence , S may be quite able to see that it is a robin that is in your bird house without being able to see that there is a robin in your bird house , for the latter achievement demands something more from S , it represents a larger increment . To see that there is a robin in the bird house one must not only be able to see that it is a robin that is in the bird house , one must also be able to see that there is , indeed , something in the bird house . A person given over to eidetic imagery may not be able to arrive at this latter piece of information on purely visual grounds . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is a robin that is in the bird house , he knows that there is a robin in the bird house ; nevertheless , he may not ( because of various afflictions ) be able to see that there is a robin in the bird house . Once again we have a case in which " p " and " q " are equivalent but , by virtue of representing different increments , S is able to see that p but is not able to see that q.  | I should stress once again that I have not argued for the claim that S can acquire the increments his perceptual reports imply that he has acquired in a distinctively visual manner . It is a further question whether philosophical scepticism can get a foothold in this area , whether S can go from the fact that this is water to the fact that this water is boiling ( the increment involved in his seeing that the water is boiling ) by purely visual means , whether he can visually bridge the gap between the fact that this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit is a tomato ( the increment involved in seeing that the piece of fruit is a tomato ) , whether he can tell on visual grounds alone whether an oak tree ( a real oak tree ) has a robin in it . All I hope to have done is to have called attention to the fact that such increments exist , and that what we describe ourselves as doing when we describe what we have seen to be the case is acquiring such increments of information in a distinctively visual way . If I may close with a slight extension of the analogy I suggested in the opening paragraph of my paper , it seems to me that the philosophic sceptic is sometimes in the position of a man who is puzzled by the presence on Times Square of an African chief . What puzzles him is the fact that the fellow said he got there by walking . Now the sceptic has a proof to show that this is impossible ; there is , as he well knows , a large body of water separating Africa and Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trouble here is that our sceptic never thought to ask where our African chief walked from . ' If he walked from 32nd 3One of the easiest ( and most used ) devices for obscuring this crucial piece of information in perceptual statements is the practice of conflating the " propositional " and the " nonpropositional " use of the verb " to see . " That is , instead of working with the statement " S sees that the water is boiling , " one transforms this into " S sees the boiling water " with the understanding that this latter is supposed to describe an epistemic achievement on S 's part . We are now in the position of being told that S knows that it ( what he sees ) is boiling water , but we are not told ( as we are in the former report ) where he came from in arriving at this knowledge . Did he see that the water was boiling ( and , hence , know that it was boiling water ) ? Did he see that the liquid was boiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiling water ) ? Did he , perhaps , see that the boiling liquid was water ( and , hence , know that it was boiling water ) ? To attempt to describe all of these different achievements with the locution " S sees the boiling water " is to suppress the crucial incremental character of what he has done .  | Street and Broadway , of course , our sceptic 's proofs about the impossibility of the man 's doing what he said he did are going to be totally irrelevant . What I tried to suggest in my paper was that some of the traditional sceptical objections to our seeing ( to be the case ) what we think and say we see ( to be the case ) are irrelevant for the same reasons .  | I take the expressions used in the title of this paper from Bishop Butler 's Dissertation entitled " Of Personal Identity . ' According to Butler , it will be recalled , when we say of a physical thing existing at one time that it is identical with , or the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " This is the same ship that we traveled on before . " ) , we are using the expression " the same as " or " identical with " in a " loose and popular sense . " But when we say of a person existing at one time that he is identical with , or the same as , a person existing at some other time ( " The ship still has the same captain it had before . " ) , we are using " the same as " or " identical with " in a " strict and philosophical sense . " I believe there is an element of truth in both theses and shall discuss them in turn . To illustrate Butler 's first thesis , that it is only in a loose and popular sense that we may speak of the identity of a physical thing through time , let us update the traditional problem of the ship of Theseus . We start with a ship made entirely of wood and give it the name " The U.S.S. South Dakota . " Then one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Joseph Butler , LL.D ( London , 1839 ) , PP. 263-70 .

"  | wooden plank is cast off and replaced by an aluminum one . Since the change is only slight , there is no question as to the survival of the U.S.S. South Dakota . We still have the ship we had before ; the ship that we have now is the same as the ship that we had before . On another day , another wooden plank is cast off and also replaced by an aluminum one . Still the same ship , since , as before , the change is only slight . The changes continue , in a similar way , and finally the U.S.S. South Dakota is made entirely of aluminum . The aluminum ship , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , for the ship we started with survived each particular change , and identity , after all , is transitive . But what happened to the discarded wooden planks ? Consider this possibility , which Thomas Hobbes suggested : " If some man had kept the old planks as they were taken out , and by putting them afterwards together in the same order , had again made a ship of them , this , without doubt , had also been the same numerical ship with that which was at the beginning ; and so there would have been two ships numerically the same , which is absurd . " ' Assuming , as perhaps one has no right to do , that each of the wooden planks survived intact throughout these changes , one might well argue that the reassembled wooden ship is the ship that we started with . " After all , it is made up of the very same parts , standing in the very same relations , whereas that ugly aluminum object does n't have a single part in common with our original ship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose that the captain of the original ship had solemnly taken the vow that , if his ship were ever to go down , he would go down with it . What , now , if the two ships collide at sea and he sees them start to sink together ? Where does his duty lie ? with the aluminum ship or with the reassembled wooden ship ? " The carriage " is another ancient version of the problem . Socrates and Plato change the parts of their carriages piece by piece until , finally , Socrates ' carriage is made up of all the parts of Plato 's original carriage and Plato 's carriage is made up of all the parts of Socrates ' original carriage . Have they exchanged their carriages or not , and if so , at what point ? Also , there is the castle William Randolph Hearst had disassembled , with each 2Thomas Hobbes , Concerning Body , chap .

Can we now say that there is a building in California more than 700 years old ? And there is the reconstructed Santa Trinita bridge in Florence , which was built , in part at least , from stones preserved from the bridge that had been there for 400 years . ' Can one still say that the Santa Trinita bridge is more than 400 years old ? Or , again , which of the two restaurants in Philadelphia is really the original Bookbinder 's ? And , finally , there is the child playing with his blocks . He builds a house with ten blocks , uses it as a garrison for his toy soldiers , disassembles it , builds many other things , then builds a house again , with each of the ten blocks occupying the position it had occupied before , and he uses it again as a garrison for his soldiers . Was the house that was destroyed the same as the one that subsequently came into being ? These puzzles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their analogues for the extension of objects through places in space . Consider the river that is known in New Orleans as " the Mississippi . " Most of us would say that the source of the river is in northern Minnesota . But what if one were to argue instead that the source is in Montana , where it is known as " the Missouri " ? Or that its source is in Pittsburgh , where it is known as " the Ohio , " or that its source is farther back where it is called " the Allegheny , " or in still another place , where it is called " the Monongahela.

Now , reading our diagram from bottom to top ( and again oversimplifying ) , we may say that if the Rhine begins at ( d ) , then it ends either with the Maas at ( a ) , or with the Waal at ( b ) , or with the Lek at ( c ) . ' Perhaps we can imagine three philosophers looking down at the river ( s ) that end ( s ) at ( d ) .

Their dispute , clearly , would be analogous in significant respects to the problem of the ship of Theseus . What are we to say of such puzzles ? We might follow the extreme course that Carneades took and simply deny the principle of the transitivity of identity . ' But let us proceed more slowly . We may begin by considering certain general principles about compound things ? things that are made up of other things . Unfortunately , most recent discussions of these matters are based upon what seems to me to be an excessively liberal ontology . It is assumed that there are those strange wholes that Brentano question of the longest river . Is the Mississippi-Missouri admissible , or is it a river and a half ?

All logicians know that the foundation of the syllogism , and consequently the faculty of reasoning , is built on this maxim : Those things which are identical with a third are the same with each other ( Quae sunt idern uno tertio sunt idem inter se ) .

This conjunctivum is not to be thought of as an abstract object ; it is not the class whose sole members are the man and the horse . It is concrete in just the sense in which the man is concrete and the horse is concrete . If the man weighs 200 pounds and the horse 2,000 , then the conjunctivum weighs 2,200 . And the man and the horse will itself be a part of ever so many other conjunctiva ? for example , the conjunctivum that is made up of the man and the horse and a certain stick or stone .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum of all the members of a class a provided ( i ) every member of a is a part of x and ( ii ) every part of x has a part in common with some member of a .

V. Quine has recurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But like Brentano and McTaggart , he assumes ( I ) that there are sums of conjunctiva . Unlike Brentano , but like McTaggart , he also assumes ( 2 ) that individual things persisting through time , like their careers or histories , have " temporal parts . " And unlike both Brentano and McTaggart , he assumes ( 3 ) that the temporal parts of individual things , also like the careers or histories of individual things , are " concrete events " or " processes , " and therefore he does not hesitate to say that the temporal parts of a thing are " stages " of the thing . Combining these assumptions he says that " a physical thing ? whether a river or a human body or a stone ? is at any one moment a sum of simultaneous momentary states of spatially scattered atoms or other small physical constituents . Now just as the thing at a moment is a sum of these spatially small parts , so we may think of the thing over a period as a sum of the temporally small parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thus a process through time , a sum of momentary " river stages .

Even if it is true that all rivers are sums of river stages , it is not true that all sums of river stages are rivers . Indeed a sum of river stages occupying a continuous period of time need not be a river .

What more is required for a sum of river stages to yield a river ? Five possible answers suggest themselves . ( I ) We could say , of course , that river stages a , b , and c , occurring or existing ' ? These discussions go at least as far back as 0 Sentido da Nova Logica ( Sao Paulo , 1944 ) , pp. 135-38 , and continue in the works cited below and in Word and Object , pp. 114-18 , 171-73 . " Methods of Logic ( New York , 1959 ) , p. 210. 12From a Logical Point of View ( New York , 1963 ) , p. 65.  | at different times , are stages of the same river if and only if there is an x such that x is a river and such that a , b , and c are all stages of x . This answer , which is not very informative , obviously presupposes the concept of a river persisting through the time in question . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and c are all to be found in the same river bed , or between the same river banks.13 But this would be to presuppose the concept of a river bed , or a pair of river banks , persisting through the time in question . To be sure , we do not need to presuppose the concept of a persisting physical thing in order to say what sums of river stages make up rivers and what sums of river stages do not . Thus ( 3 ) , given the concept of a person persisting through time , we might be able to define a persisting river in terms of river stages and accessibility to his observation . But in this case , presumably , we should not expect to define the persistence of a person by reference to the persistence of his body . Or ( 4 ) , given the concept of a place persisting through time , we could say that a sum of river stages makes up a river provided its elements all occupy the same place . But then we should not expect to define @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the persistence of the various physical things that might be said to occupy it . And presumably we should say , with Newton , that places are parts of space and that " absolute space , in its own nature , without relation to anything external , remains always similar and immovable . " Or , finally ( 5 ) , we could introduce a technical term ? " cofluvial " for example ? and say that a , b , and c are stages of the same river if and only if they are co fluvial with each other.14 But unless we 13This view is suggested by St. Thomas : " The Seine river is not this particular river ' because of this flowing water , ' but because of this source ' and this bed , ' and hence is always called the same river , although there may be other water flowing down it ; likewise a people is the same , not because of sameness of soul or of man , but because of the same dwelling place , or rather because of the same laws and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III Politica " ( De Spiritualibus Creaturis , Art .

" He writes : " We begin , let us imagine , with momentary things and their interrelations . One of these momentary things , called a , is a momentary stage of the river Cayster , in Lydia , around 400 B.C. Another , called b , is a momentary stage of the Caster two days later .  | have some independent way of explicating the concept of cofluviality , this fifth possible answer would seem not to differ substantially from the first . For my own part , I am reluctant to count " sums " or " conjunctiva " as individual things . I would prefer to say , with Boethius , that a man and a horse are not one thing.15 I think we may say , though we need not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up of temporal parts . If we do say this , then we may construe the statement " St. Paul 's had an interesting history during the nineteenth century " as referring to a certain entity which , like the history of St. Paul 's , is such that part of it existed in 1801 , another part of it existed in 18o2 , and so on , for all the other years of the century . But I am most reluctant to say that St. Paul 's , like the history of St. Paul 's , is itself a process or event . ( It would certainly be a mistake ? a " category mistake " if ever there was one ? to say that St. Paul 's is the history of St. Paul 's . ) With these preconceptions , then , let us consider the persistence of rivers , ships , and other such objects through time . To avoid mere verbal questions , let us introduce the technical term " compositum " to refer to what is made up of parts , and let us take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undefined but attempt to understand it in its ordinary sense . Naturally the term " part , " in its ordinary sense , is vague . It is very easy to think of borderline cases where we would not know whether to apply the term or not . For example , should we say of A third , c , is a momentary stage , at this same latter date , of the same multiplicity of water molecules which were in the river at the time of a . Half of c is in the lower Caster valley , and the other half is to be found at diffuse points in the Aegean Sea . Thus , a , b , and c are three objects , variously related . We may say that a and b stand in the relation of river kinship , and that a and c stand in the relation of water kinship . Now the introduction of rivers as single entities , namely , processes or time-consuming objects , consists substantially in reading identity in place of river kinship " ( From a Logical Point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of the final sentence would be : " The introduction of river stages as momentary entities consists substantially in reading river kinship in place of identity " ? in place , that is , of a river that persists through time . 15See D. P. Henry , The Logic of Saint Anselm ( Oxford , 1967 ) , p. 56.  | a card that had been part of a deck of cards that it is still a part of that deck of cards , once the various cards have been scattered or some of them torn apart ? But there are also cases that are not borderline ; let us confine ourselves to these . If we understand " part " in its ordinary sense , then it is clear that neither a man nor a fish should be called a part of a man and a fish . Nor should we call a fin or a foot a part of a man and a fish . But a foot is a part of a body of a man and a fin a part of a body of a fish.ls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following three properties . ( 1 ) Part of is transitive : a part of a part of a thing is itself a part of the thing . If my thumb is a part of my hand and my hand is a part of my body , then my thumb is a part of my body . ( 2 ) Part of is also asymmetric : if A is part of B then B is not part of A. Nothing , then , will be a part of itself . Hence we are dealing with what mathematicians call " proper parts " and with what other people simply call " parts . " And ( 3 ) , everything that is a part of some thing is such that there is some other thing that is a part of it . ' We may say that a compositum is anything that has a part ; in other words , if A is a compositum , then there is something B such that B is part of A. Let us consider a rather simple compositum , UWXV , made up of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " X , " and " V , " and fastened together in some way . The separate blocks , U , W , X , and V , are parts of this compositum . There is a clear sense in which we may say that these four blocks and nothing else are what make up this compositum ; for it is composed of just these four blocks . Yet to say that it is composed of just these four blocks is not to say that these four blocks are the only parts of the compositum , for the blocks themselves have parts . Thus each block has a front half and a back half and these halves are themselves parts of the compositum UWXV . Moreover , although the compositum UWXV is composed just of U , W , X , and V , it is also composed just of certain other things : 16I am assuming , then , that there is a reasonable mean between " monadism " and " collectivism " ? where monadism is the view according to which there are no things composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which , for any two things A and B , there is a thing composed of just A and B. 17Cf . A. N. Whitehead 's discussion of " part , " in The Organization of Thought ( London , 1917 ) , pp. 158-66.  | for example , UW and XV ; also U , WX , and V ; also U , W , X , and the right half of V and the left half of V ; and so on . The blocks themselves make up smaller composita inside the larger compositum . Thus UW is a part of UWXV , and so are WX , UWX , XV , and WXV.18 If , however , the blocks are laid along horizontally as in our picture , UWXV , then we should not say that UX , or UXV , or WV , or UVW are parts of UWXV . For these entities , if they are entities , are mere conjunctiva and are not joined together as composita . And this is quite in accord with our intuitions . My thumb is a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as something that has the thumb and fingers as parts , is also a part of my body ; but the conjunctivum consisting of my thumb and little finger is not also a part of my body . What does it mean to say that our compositum , UWXV , is made up just of U , W , X , and V , or , as we may also say , composed just of U , W , X , and V ? Let us note first that the separate blocks , U , W , X , and V , are entirely distinct from each other : they have no parts in common . And secondly , every part of UTVXV has some part in common either with U or with W or with X or with V. More generally , let us say : A is entirely distinct from B , provided : there is no X such that X is a part of A and X is also part of B. A is composed of B and C , provided : B is part of A ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from C ; and there is no part of A that is entirely distinct both from B and from C. 19 And now we may make one negative point about identity . If we say that the chair is the back , the seat , and the legs , we are not using the " is " of identity . We are using what has been called " the is ' of composition . " We are saying that the back , the seat , 18Cf . McTaggart : " Great Britain , for example , consists of England , Scotland , and Wales . And it does not consist of anything except England , Scotland , and Wales . But these are not all the parts of Great Britain , for Surrey is also a part of it " ( The Nature of Existence , I , 134 ) . 19These definitions ( in a somewhat different terminology ) were suggested by Whitehead , The Organization of Thought , pp. 159-60 . If we wish to accommodate the first definition to the possibility that there are simples ( a possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumption about the relation part of ) , we should add the further clause " it is false that A is identical with B " ; otherwise , the definition would require us to say of any simple that it is entirely distinct from itself .  | and the legs are what make up the chair ? that the chair is composed of the back , the seat , and the legs , in the sense of " composed of " just discussed.20 Before returning to our puzzles , let us consider certain relevant things that may happen to composita , or certain things that may be done to composita . We may remove a part , say U , from our compositum and there will be two resulting composita , WXV and U , which no longer go to make up a single compositum . In such a case , we may say that UWXV has been disassembled . ( Or should we say just " partially disassembled " ? But " partially disassemble " contrasts with " completely disassemble . " And can one completely disassemble anything , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing there is something that is a proper part of that part ? ) Using tenseless language , we might define the relevant concept of disassembly in the following way : A is disassembled at t , provided : there is an X and a Y such that A is composed of X and Y at a time prior to t , and nothing is composed of X and Y at t . ( In our example , A would be UWXV , X would be U , and Y could be WXV . ) But if we take tense seriously , we will prefer to say : A has been disassembled , provided : there was an X and a Y such that A had been composed of X and Y , and nothing is composed of X and Y. In this latter case , presumably we should also say that A has been destroyed , that it has ceased to be . ( And this is why we say " there was " rather than " there is " in the definiens , since X and Y may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this significant difference between our composition UWXV and the conjunctivum or sum made up of just U , W , X , and V : in separating U from 20U . T. Place has used the expression " the is ' of composition , " and cites the following as examples of its use : " her hat is a bundle of straw tied together with string , " " a cloud is a mass of water droplets or other particles in suspension . " But he understands the expression somewhat more broadly than it is intended here , for he says that the " is " in " consciousness is just brain process " is the " is " of composition . See U. T. Place , " Is Consciousness a Brain-Process ? , " British Journal of Psychology , XLVII ( 1956 ) , 44 ? 50.  | WXV , we destroy the compositum , but we do not destroy the conjunctivum or sum.21 We may also rearrange the parts of a compositum with disassembling it , and therefore without destroying it . Provided we do n't allow any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others , we may rearrange our compositum UWXV by putting our blocks in the order VUWX instead of UWXV . But , although the total compositum UWXV has not been disassembled in this process , some of those composita that go to make up UWXV have been disassembled , namely , XV and WXV . ( If disassembling a compositum is the same as destroying it , these facts are relevant to what one might call " the theory of destruction . " The fact that we can rearrange the parts of a compositum without destroying it may lead us to believe , mistakenly , that we may confine our activities to rearrangement without ever destroying anything . ) Let us now picture a child playing with lettered blocks of the kind we have been discussing . He can fasten them together and take them apart ; he makes horizontal composita and then alters them in various ways , for whatever reasons you may care to imagine . Let us suppose that he starts with four blocks , W , E , C , and A. Perhaps he has found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Starting with this compositum , he creates what I would like to call an " evolving system of composita . " One such system is illustrated by the accompanying diagram . ( I ) WECA ( 2 ) WEC ( 3 ) WECI ( q . ) WICE ( 5 ) WECI These various composita , each of the lower ones being made from the one immediately above it , exemplify various types of change . Thus , from ( I ) to ( 2 ) , we have mere removal , or subtraction , of a certain part . The child simply separates A from WEC , thus disassembling and therefore destroying WECA . In the change from ( 2 ) to ( 3 ) , we have addition . The child adds I to WEC , 21This is not to say , of course , that conjunctiva or sums are incapable of destruction .  | thus causing WECI to come into being . In the change from ( 3 ) to ( 4 ) , we have mere rearrangement ( provided the child does not separate any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the change from ( 4 ) to ( 5 ) , we also have rearrangement , but this time , some may be tempted to say , rearrangement that involves " re-creation .

Locke 's " One thing can not have two beginnings of existence " in Book II , chap . xxvii , sec. i , of his Essay . Reid 's argument seems to be fallacious , however . It is a manifest contradiction to say of a thing that it " had existence before its first production " or that it will " have existence after its final passing away .

A'nd my own feeling is that it is neither contradictory nor senseless to suppose that a person may come into being again after he has ceased to exist .  | another compositum of water molecules , the later having evolved from the earlier . In its relation to composita , the ship differs only in degree from the river . In stepping onto the same ship twice , one steps first onto one compositum and then one steps onto what in all probability is another compositum ( for presumably something , however slight , will have been lost , and something , however slight , will have been added ) . And so , too , for most other physical things that we may encounter on different occasions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second , some part , in all probability , will have been added , or taken away , with the result that we encounter different composita , though we may wish to say that in so doing we encounter one and the same physical thing . For although the composita are different they go to make up the same physical thing.23 What relation must obtain between two different composita if , as we have put it , they go to make up the same physical thing ? If the ship that we see today is the same as the ship that we saw yesterday , despite the fact that the compositum we see today , in seeing the ship today , is different from the compositum we saw yesterday , in seeing the ship yesterday , then the compositum that we see today may be said at least to have evolved from the compositum that we saw yesterday . What does this mean ? Let us say that a given compositum N directly evolves from a certain compositum A provided the following condition holds : N and A have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly results either from rearranging parts of A , or from adding parts of A , or from removing parts from A. And , for simplicity , let us misuse the word " evolves " so that we may also say that any given compositum also evolves from itself ; if N is identical with A , then N has evolved from A , and A has evolved from N. N may be the result of rearrangement , subtraction , and 23Cf . W. V. Quine : " All this applies as well to the river or human body as to the stone . There is only a difference of detail in the two cases : in the case of the stone the constituent particle-moments pair off fairly completely from one date to another as momentary states of the same particles , whereas in the case of the river or human body there is more heterogeneity in this respect " ( Methods of Logic , p. 210 ) .  | addition , as when the car owner replaces two back tires with new ones , but puts the new tires on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we encounter the same ship on two different occasions , the compositum we encounter on the second occasion in all probability will not have evolved directly from the compositum we encountered on the earlier occasion . There will rather be a series of composita , one of which will have evolved directly from the one we encountered on the earlier occasion , another of which will have evolved directly from that , and so on , perhaps for many different composita , resulting finally in the compositum we encountered on the later occasion . The later compositum will thus have evolved from the first , even though it did not directly evolve from the first . The relation that evolving bears to directly evolving will thus be analogous to the relation that ancestor bears to parent . And thus we could define " evolution " in terms of " direct evolution " by imitating Frege 's definition of the ancestral relation . N is an ancestor of A , Frege said in effect , provided that the following condition holds : N is a member of every class C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C and ( 2 ) whatever is parent of anything that is a member of C is also a member of C.24 Let us say , then , that a compositum N evolves from a compositum A , provided that : N is a member of every class C such that ( I ) A is a member of C and ( 2 ) whatever directly evolves from anything that is a member of C is also a member of C. If we do step into the same river twice , then , though we may be stepping into different composita of water molecules , the later compositum will have evolved , in the sense defined , from the earlier compositum . And analogously for the ship and for any other physical thing . But we may step onto a ship , then later step onto a compositum which evolved in this way from the compositum we stepped on when we stepped on the ship , without thereby stepping onto the same ship twice . Thus the ship ? or , rather , the composita that make it up ? can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundations of Arithmetic , sec. 79 ( p. 92e ) . Compare Russell and Whitehead 's discussion in Principia Mathematica ( Cambridge , Eng. , 1910 ) , I , 548ff ; they refer to Frege 's Begriffschrift ( Halle , 1879 ) , Part III , PP. 55 ? 87 ?  | a ship . For example , it can be towed onto land and transformed into a house.25 We may say , then , that if a compositum A and a compositum N go to make up the same ship , it is necessary but not sufficient that one of the composita have evolved from the other . What more is necessary ? We are asking , in effect , for a definition of a ship . But our question may be put somewhat more precisely as " What is it for two different composita to make up or constitute the same ship ? " Actually , of course , we are not now interested in trying to fix a definition of a ship , specifically . We are concerned with the more general question " What is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the composita that make them up ? " So let us consider ships only in a very schematic way . Noah Webster said that a ship is " a structure used for transportation in water . " If this were an acceptable definition , we could say of two composita , A and N , that they make up or constitute the same ship provided that the following condition holds : A is ( or was ) a structure used for transportation in water and so is N ; and every compositum B such that B evolved from A and N evolved from B was also a structure used for transportation in water . The final clause ? about " every compositum B " ? is inserted to accommodate the prejudice that if a ship is transformed into a house and if the house is then transformed into a ship , then the ship that came from the house can not be the same ship as the one that became a house . But as a definition of a ship the foregoing is not entirely satisfactory . Part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in water " is , of course , much too restrictive . A ship could remain in port without ever setting sail . Nor would it be enough to add that the structure be intended to be used for transportation in water . A ship could be built merely to serve as a salesman 's model in the store window , or as a monument , or , like the reduced-scale whaling ship in New Bedford , as a museum piece . We may add qualification upon qualification , but we can never be certain , I suggest , that our definition will do . The term " ship , " 25An Aristotelian who took ships seriously might wish to say that in such a case " substantial change " has taken place . And one who took words seriously might wish to say that , when our child alters his blocks from WICE to NICE , another " substantial change " has taken place .  | and the expression " the same ship , " is not only vague and opentextured ; it is also defeasible . Any set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future " defeat . " Consider a hydrofoil , a new kind of hydrofoil that is incapable of floating but is propelled by jets and glides along the surface of the water . It would count as a ship , given certain earlier technical definitions of ship , but who would want to call that a ship ? To say that the term " ship " is thus defeasible is to say something about ourselves . It is to say , in part , that though we may accept certain conditions as constituting for the time being our criteria for the correct application of the word " ship , " we reserve to ourselves the right of revising these criteria should they turn out to sanction uses that would be inconvenient or otherwise undesirable . And similarly for " the same ship . " Which compositum is to be called " the U.S.S. South Dakota " ? the wooden one or the aluminum one ? The question called for a convention ; we can have it pretty much as we wish , provided we agree . And the point does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captain go down with ? You and I ca n't decide , but the courts , or the ships ' courts , can decide . If the captain has agreed to go down with the U.S.S. South Dakota , and if they decide that the aluminum one and not the wooden one is the U.S.S. South Dakota , then down with the aluminum one he ought to go . The important thing here is this : the convention of the courts , or the proper authorities , will settle the matter . It would make no sense to say , " Well it just might be , you know , that they are mistaken . It just might be that , unknown to them , the wooden ship and not the aluminum one is the U.S.S. South Dakota . " 26 There are two rather different points to make , then , about the expression " the same ship . " One is the point just made ? that the concept of being the same ship is defeasible and hence that , where there is question of applicability , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is itself neither true nor false and which therefore can not be contradicted by any actual state of affairs . And the second point is that " the same ship " is a logical construction in just the same way in which " the average Englishman " 26Cf . Shoemaker , Self-Knowledge and Self-Identity , pp. 25-31.  | is a logical construction . It has been decreed , let us suppose , that the U.S.S. South Dakota is the aluminum ship compositum . So now all of us , or those of us who conform , call the aluminum compositum " the U.S.S. South Dakota " ; it will continue the traditions that were established in the wooden compositum , and the captain now knows where his obligations lie . But everything that we know about the U.S.S. South Dakota could be put by reference merely to the different composita which at different times went to make it up . Talk about ships that endure through time can be reduced to talk about composita , to talk about evolving systems of composita , in just the way in which talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular Englishmen . We may say that the U.S.S. South Dakota had a long and glorious history , but this is not to say that in addition to the wooden composita , the mixed ones , and the aluminum ones , there was also a ship that had a history . Similarly , we may say that the average Englishman has 0.7 cats in his house , but this is not to say that in addition to particular Englishmen , cats , and houses , there is an average Englishman who has in his house 0.7 of a cat . Or , if we do not care for the modern terminology , we may say that the ship , like Aristotle 's musical man , is an " ens per accidence. " 27 The ship is " an accident " of the various composita that served to make it up . We have seen that the ship need not survive the evolving series of composita that , for a while , served to make it up . The ship will cease to be , once the series becomes a system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now surely when , as we say , the ship " ceases to be , " what has happened is simply that the system of composita has been altered . Some compositum that served to make up a ship evolved into a compositurn that did not make up a ship , and this compositum in turn evolved into one that made up a house . What I have said about ships holds in principle for most of the familiar physical things that we encounter ? rivers , chairs , trees , picket lines . I would suggest that most physical things are similarly reducible to evolving systems of composita . The particular thing , as St. Augustine said , is " composed of many , all 27 " The musical man passed away and an unmusical man came to be , but the man persists as identically the same " ( Generation and Corruption , I , 4 , 319b ) .  | of which exist not together . " 28 I have considered only fairly simple ways in which composita may evolve into other composita . The relations among actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide an interesting example . Consider the late " Phoebe Snow , " which left Hoboken every morning for Chicago.29 The cars were substantial enough . But two trains of cars ? two composita made up by attaching cars together ? could both go to make up the " Phoebe Snow " without the one in any way evolving from the other . Today 's train did not need to have any cars in common with yesterday 's , but it had to keep the same schedule and travel over the same roadbed , or rather it had to keep approximately the same schedule and travel over approximately the same roadbed . Had you pointed in the direction of the train and asked , " Have you ever ridden on that ? " your question might well have been ambiguous , depending upon what you meant to single out with your use of " that . " You might have meant simply the " Phoebe Snow " ; you might , if you were a trainman , have meant that particular train of cars or , more likely , just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heraclitus , have meant that particular compositum which at that particular moment went to make up that particular car or train of cars . But the increase in complexity of these various composita and their interrelations makes no difference to the two general points I wanted to stress : the one being that our criteria for what it is for two composita to make up the same so-and-so are defeasible and a matter only of convention ( it makes no sense to say that our altered criteria are incorrect , false , or mistaken ) ; and the other point being that familiar physical things may be regarded either as " logical constructions upon , " or as " accidents of , " what I have been calling " evolving systems of composita . " What , then , is the point of speaking of a " loose and popular " sense of identity ? 28Confessions , IV , xi . 29Alternative ways of looking at passing away are reflected in two different headlines announcing its demise : " Phoebe Snow Rolls into Oblivion " ( Providence Evening Bulletin , Nov. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ End on Nov. 27 " ( New York Times , Nov. 13 , 1966 ) .  | Let us return to the problem of identifying ships through time . The accompanying diagram illustrates , very schematically , what might occur . Figure A , we may suppose , was the compositum that was originally launched . It evolved into B ; B then evolved into two distinct cornposita , C and D ; C then evolved into E ; and D evolved into F. Suppose now we find two reasonable men disputing about E and F , where , as in our diagram , E is to the left of F. The one man says , " The ship on the left is identical with the ship that we traveled on when we took the maiden voyage , and the ship on the right is not . " The other man , feeling himself in strong disagreement , says , " That is entirely wrong . The ship on the right is identical with the ship that we traveled on when we took the maiden voyage , and the ship on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say of these uses of " is identical with " ? The following relevant points seem to me to be clear . ( I ) Cornpositum E is not identical with compositum F ; ( 2 ) compositum E is not identical with compositum A ; ( 3 ) compositum F is not identical with compositum A ; ( 4 ) E and A belong to a system of composita , namely ABCE , to which F does not belong ; ( 5 ) F and A belong to a system of composita , namely ABDF , to which E does not belong ; ( 6 ) both E and F belong to a system of cornposita , namely ABCDEF , to which A belongs ; and ( 7 ) A belongs to a system of composita , namely AB , to which neither E nor F belongs . If our two men can be made to see these points , then , since we have assumed them to be reasonable , perhaps they will agree that their dispute over the question " Is the ship on the right , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we traveled on when we took the maiden voyage ? " is a dispute merely about words and one that can be settled merely by agreeing upon a set of conventions . If their dispute concerned any of the points , ( I ) through ( 7 ) above , it would be a dispute about the strict and philosophical sense of identity . But if they agree on points ( 1 ) through ( 7 ) , then they are disputing only about the loose and popular sense of identity .  | And what now of Bishop Butler 's second thesis ? his thesis that it is in a strict and philosophical sense and not merely in a loose and popular sense that we can speak of the persistence of one and the same person through time ? This thesis might be construed as telling us that there is a very clear sense in which the concept of sameness , or identity , as applied to persons persisting through time , is not subject to " defeat " or to " convention " ? that there is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " convention " are concerned , " the same person " differs fundamentally from " the same ship , " " the same house , " and " the same railroad train . " Now there is , of course , a sense in which the concept of " the same person " is subject to defeat and is at the mercy of convention . What I wish to say is that the persisting person differs from the persisting ship in that there is also a sense in which the applicability of " same " is not subject to defeat or at the mercy of convention . But let us first note the sense in which this concept might be subject to defeat in order that we may contrast it with the sense in which it is not . There are circumstances under which one might say , " Mr. Jones is not at all the same person he used to be . You will be disappointed . He is not the person that you remember . " We would not say this sort of thing if Mr. Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had undergone changes that were quite basic and thoroughgoing ? the kind of changes that might be produced by psychoanalysis , or by a lobotomy , or by a series of personal tragedies . But just how basic and thoroughgoing must these changes be if we are to say of Mr. Jones that he is a different person ? The proper answer would seem to be " As basic and thoroughgoing as you would like . It 's just a matter of convention . It all depends upon how widely it is convenient for you to construe the expression He 's the same person he used to be . ' In so far as the rules of language are in your own hands , you may have it any way you would like . " But this is only a " loose and popular " sense of identity . When we say , in this sense , " Jones is no longer the person he used to be , " we do not mean that there is , or was , a certain entity such that Jones was formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do not mean to imply that there are ( or have been ) certain entities , x and y , such that at one time x is , or was , identical with y , and at another time x is not identical with y . For this , I believe , is incoherent , but " Jones is no longer the person he used to be " is not . Nor do we mean , when we say , " Jones is no longer the person he used to be , " that there was a certain entity , the old Jones , which no longer exists , and that there is a certain different entity , the new Jones , which somehow has taken his place . We are not describing the kind of change that takes place when one president succeeds another . In the latter case , there is a clear answer to the question " What happened to the old one ? " The answer might be " He was shot " or " He retired to Gettysburg . " But when we decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confronted with such questions as " What happened , then , to the old Jones ? Did he die , or was he annihilated , or disassembled , or did he retire to some other place ? " For the old Jones did not die ; he was not annihilated or disassembled and he did not retire to any other place . He became the new Jones . To say of anything that it became a so-and-so is to say of it that it took on certain properties that it did not have before . ( But contrast the " became " of " Jones then became a married man , " said when Jones ceased to be a bachelor , with that of " The President then became a Democrat , " said when President Eisenhower retired . ) When we say of a thing that it has properties that it did not have before , we are saying that there is an x such that x formerly had such-and-such properties and x presently has such-and-such other properties . But to say that there is an x ? at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now that , is to presuppose the identity of x through time , in the " strict and philosophical " sense of identity . So if we say that Jones is " not the same person " he was before , we are using " same " only in a " loose and popular " sense ; but in saying that he is not the same person that he was before , we are presupposing that , in the " strict and philosophical " sense , the same person has in fact persisted from then until now . " But , " one may object , " need we presuppose this ? Need we presuppose the persistence of a single subject of change when , as we say , the man becomes a new person ' ? " To appreciate the situation , it may be necessary to imagine that the person in question  | is oneself . Suppose , then , that you were such a person , that you had undergone basic and thoroughgoing changes , and that your friends and acquaintances were in agreement that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you remember all of the relevant facts , that you had formerly been a person of such-and-such a sort , that you had undergone certain shattering experiences , and that these then led to a transformation in your personality , with the result that you are not the person that you formerly were ? Let us imagine , however , that your friends and acquaintances say to you : " But you are such a very different person now that henceforth we are going to treat you like one . We will call you Smith ' instead of Jones . ' We will make certain that you are free from all the obligations that Jones incurred . And if you feel guilty about some of the wicked things that Jones did , you need no longer do so . For we can get the highest courts to lay it down that you are two quite different people . " Something , surely , is wrong here . Some people , I have found , see at once that something is wrong and others do not . For those who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different direction . What would we think of such talk if we were to hear it before rather than after the transformation of our personality ? It will be instructive to elaborate upon an example that C. S. Peirce suggests.30 Let us assume that you are about to undergo an operation and that you still have a decision to make . The utilities involved are , first , financial ? you wish to avoid any needless expense ? and , secondly , the avoidance of pain , the avoidance , however , just of your pain , for pain that is other than yours , let 30 " If the power to remember dies with the material body , has the question of any single person 's future life after death any particular interest for him ?

Now if we had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were going to be cut for the stone , suppose the surgeon were to say , You will suffer damnably , but I will administer this drug so that you during the suffering lose all memory of your previous life .

' " ( Collected Papers Cambridge , Mass. , 1935 , V , 355 ) .  | us assume , is of no concern whatever to you . The doctor proposes two operating procedures ? one a very expensive procedure in which you will be subjected to total anesthesia and no pain will be felt at all , and the other of a rather different sort . The second operation will be very inexpensive indeed ; there will be no anesthesia at all and therefore there will be excruciating pain . But the doctor will give you two drugs : first , a drug just before the operation which will induce complete amnesia , so that while you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your present life ; and , secondly , just after the agony is over , a drug that will make you completely forget everything that happened on the table . The question is : given the utilities involved , namely , the avoidance of needless expense and the avoidance of pain that you will feel , other pains not mattering , is it reasonable to opt for the less expensive operation ? It seems to me quite obvious that it is not reasonable , even if you can be completely certain that the two amnesia injections will be successful . It will be you who undergoes that pain , even though you , Jones , will not know that it is Jones who is undergoing it and even though you will never remember it . But although this seems quite obvious to me , I must concede that I can not supply you with an argument for it . I am afraid I can say only that either you see it or you do n't . Now I can appreciate that it might not seem obvious to you , as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would certainly like to save the money . But I wonder ? wo n't it be I who 's going to feel the pain , wo n't I be in agony , even if I do n't know that it 's I ? " I can understand your not being sure and I can appreciate that what is here obvious to me may not be obvious to you . But there is a slightly different point that ought to be obvious to you , and if this other point is not obvious I am afraid I will not appreciate it . Suppose that others come to you as you ponder your decision ? friends , relatives , judges , clergymen . And they say : " Have no fear . Take the cheaper operation and we will take care of everything . We will lay it down that the man on the table is not you , Jones , but is Smith . We will not allow this occasion to be mentioned in your biography . And during the time that you lie there on the table ? excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , during the time that Smith lies there on the table ? we will say Poor Smith ' and we will not say , even in our  | hearts , Poor Jones . ' " What ought to be obvious to you , it seems to me , is that the laying down of this convention should have no effect at all upon your decision . Suppose you knew that your body , like that of an amoeba , would one day undergo fission and that you would go off , so to speak , in two different directions . Suppose you also knew , somehow , that the one who went off to the left would experience the most wretched of lives and that the one who went off to the right would experience a life of great happiness and value . It seems to me , first , that there is no possibility whatever that you would be both the person on the right and the person on the left . It seems to me , secondly , that there is a possibility that you would be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moreover , that you could be one of those persons and yet have no memory at all of your present existence.31 It follows that it would be reasonable of you to hope that you will be the one on the right and not the one on the left , also that it would be reasonable of you to have this hope even if you knew that the one on the right would have no memory of your present existence . Indeed it would be reasonable of you to have it even if you knew that the one on the left thought he remembered the facts of your present existence . And it seems to me to be absolutely certain that no fears that you might have , about being the half on the left , could reasonably be allayed by the adoption of a convention , even though it were laid down by the highest authorities . 31In this case , there might well be no criterion by means of which you or anyone else could decide which of the two halves was in fact yourself . I would agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firstperson psychological statements to be true , or the fact that we make them ( for the most part ) only when they are true , can not possibly be explained on the supposition that we make them on the basis of criteria " ( Self-Knowledge and Self-Identity , p. 214 ) . It follows from this contention , I think , that it makes sense to suppose , in connection with the above example , that you are in fact the half that goes off to the left and not the one that goes off to the right even though there is no criterion at all by means of which anyone could decide the matter . I would disagree , incidentally , with what Shoemaker says ( pp. 236ff. ) about the relationship between criteria and necessary truths ? at least , if " necessary " is taken to mean the same as " logically necessary . " My own views on this question may be suggested by chapter IV ( " The Problem of the Criterion " ) in my Theory of Knowledge ( Englewood Cliffs , N.J. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of Bishop Butler that the identity we ascribe to ships and the like is identity only in a " loose and popular sense , " whereas the identity ascribed to persons is identity in a " strict and philosophical sense . " This is a view I have a good deal of sympathy with , and I think that until we have satisfactorily explained the considerations that make it plausible we can not claim to have an adequate understanding of the way in which the notion of identity applies to familiar kinds of things , and in particular to persons . A number of these considerations , including some that hitherto have gone virtually unnoticed , are brought out extremely well in Chisholm 's paper . But it is my present opinion that explaining the plausibility of Butler 's view must , in the end , amount mainly to explaining it away . There are interesting and important differences between the identity of persons and the identity of other things , but I do not believe that these differences are aptly described by saying that only the former is identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall comment first on what Chisholm says about the identity of ships and other sorts of physical things . One of his claims is that ships and the like may be regarded as " logical constructions upon , " or as " accidents of , " what he calls " evolving systems of composita . " The contrasting claim about personal identity , which Chisholm does not explicitly argue in this paper , is that persons are not logical constructions . I agree that persons are not logical constructions , but I find some difficulties in the thesis that ships are logical constructions . Presumably part of what is meant by saying that ships are logical constructions upon evolving systems of composita is that it is not merely true but necessarily true that if a ship existing at t2 is identical with a ship that previously existed at h. then there is  | an evolving system of composita satisfying a certain description , one member of which existed at ti and another member of which exists at t2 . Now this may be true , but is it clear that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass over quickly , is that Chisholm 's explication of the notion of a compositum , or of the notion of a part in terms of which the notion of a compositum is defined , seems to assume the infinite divisibility of matter . For he tells us that " everything that is a part of a thing is itself something that has a part . " The difficulty I see here is simply that it seems unclear what are to count as the parts of a ship when we get down to the submicroscopic level , and that if it is said that the parts are the elementary particles of physical theory then we can not rule out a priori that the best theory will turn out to be one according to which the elementary particles are extensionless and so do not themselves have parts . Let us waive this difficulty , though , and assume that at any time at which a volume of space is occupied by a ship it is occupied by a compositum , which we will call a " ship compositum . " Even on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the different ship composita that constitute the ship at different times should form an evolving system of composita in Chisholm 's sense . Suppose that a ship is in the harbor all day , but that at noon one ship compositum ceases to exist there and another takes its place . For the later of these ship composita to have directly evolved from the earlier it is necessary that they have parts in common . But is this necessary in order for it to be the case that the ship in the harbor after noon is the same as the one that was there before ? It seems to me conceivable , though it is perhaps quite unlikely , that the best physical theory should turn out to be one according to which there is constant " creation " and " annihilation " of particles at the submicroscopic level , each fundamental particle existing for only a billionth of a second . If we may speak of these fundamental particles as the " ultimate parts " of all composita , it might then be the case that the last ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts in common with the first ship compositum in the harbor after noon , even though the case is one in which anyone would say that there had been one and only one ship in the harbor all day long . It may be said that while these two temporally adjacent ship composita would have no ultimate parts in common , they would still have parts in com-  | won , e.g. , planks , and that this is enough to satisfy the condition that the later of them directly evolved from the earlier . But it would appear that , on Chisholm 's account , these ship composita can have planks in common only if they have parts of planks in common , that they can have parts of planks in common only if they have parts of parts of planks in common , and so on until we get down to the ultimate parts . And so it would seem that if they have no ultimate parts in common they can have no parts in common at all , and that the later of them can not have directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very clear that the acceptance of such a physical theory would not lead us to say that for all we know there is a different ship in the harbor every minute or so . I turn now to a different point . The way in which Chisholm originally introduces the expression " compositum " makes it appear that ordinary physical things , ships , tables , automobiles , etc. , are composita , for such things are composed of the very sorts of parts of which composita are said to be composed . Yet Chisholm tells us that " in stepping onto the same ship twice , one steps first onto one compositum and then steps onto what in all probability is another compositum . " The identity conditions for ships differ from the identity conditions for composita . The ship now in the harbor can not be said to be , in the sense of being identical with , the ship compositum now in the harbor , for things will be true of the former , e.g. , that it was built ten years ago and that I stepped onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' And this gives rise to difficulties . First of all , while it is clear enough what are to count as parts of a ship , it now begins to be unclear what are to count as the parts of the composita that somehow constitute the ship . A plank ' Here I am relying on Leibniz 's law of " the indiscernibility of identicals . " In his recent paper " Time , Existence and Identity " ( Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society , 1965-66 ) , A. N. Prior has suggested that we may have to abandon this law in order to be able to apply the notion of identity to cases of " fission " ( such as that mentioned by Chisholm at the end of his paper ) . But Prior points out that if we abandon this law we will still have the law " CIxyCIxzAAIyzPlyzFlyz , " which says : " If x is identical with y then if x is identical with z then either y is identical with z or y has been identical with z or y will be identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield the result that a ship can not be identical with each of the different composita that constitute it .  | can be part of a ship , but can a compositum have a plank as a part ? It seems that planks , like ships , will turn out to be not cornposita but " logical constructions upon evolving systems of composita . " In that case the ship compositum will presumably be composed not of planks , but of plank composita . And is it clear what these are , and what their parts will be ? The difficulty here is that Chisholm 's account relies on our ordinary understanding of " part , " " composed of , " etc. in its explanation of the notion of a compositum , and yet tells us , by implication , that what we would ordinarily count as things composed of parts are not composita and that what we would ordinarily count as the physical parts of things are not the parts of which composita are composed . A further difficulty is that Chisholm 's procedure at one point seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather that some composita are ships . He says that if Noah Webster 's definition of " ship " were satisfactory we could say of two composita , A and N , that they make up or constitute the same ship if the following condition holds : " A is ( or was ) a structure used for transportation in water and so is N ; and each compositum B such that B evolved from A and N evolved from B was also a structure used for transportation in water . " But this involves speaking of the individual ship composita as " structures used for transportation in water , " and in Webster 's definition this would mean that the composita are ships . It is true that Chisholm goes on to say that Webster 's definition is unsatisfactory , but it looks as if the procedure he outlines for defining " same ship " depends on the definition of " ship , " whatever it is , applying to the different composita that constitute the same ship at different times . Now there is of course nothing wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single building , and those who do n't object to speaking of rivers as four-dimensional entities can say with Quine that the same river is built up out of different river stages . But while there is no objection to speaking of one and the same ship being constituted out of different something-orothers , there does seem to be something wrong with saying that the different something-or-others that constitute a ship are themselves ships . Someone might try to avoid these difficulties by taking the Geachian line that " x is the same as y " is always elliptical for something of the form " x is the same F as y , " where F occupies  | the place of a general term . He could then say that the compositum in the harbor today and the one that was there yesterday are both ships , and that while they are different composita they are one and the same ship . But this seems to me a very questionable view . ' It is true that a sentence of the form " x is the same as y " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its terms is clear , and that one common way of making the reference of the terms clear is by inserting a general term after " same . " But that , I think , is the only function such a general term can serve there ; it seems to me a mistake to think that the general term can have the function of indicating that one sort of identity rather than another ( ship identity rather than compositum identity , or vice versa ) is being asserted to hold between already specified entities . There are not , I think , different sorts of numerical identity , though there can be identity statements about indefinitely many kinds of entities . It is worth noting that the insertion of a general term after " same " is not the only way of making the reference of the terms of an identity statement clear . The sentence " What you see in the harbor is the same as what you saw in the harbor yesterday " can be said to be elliptical , for the phrase " what you see in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either a ship or a ship compositum . But the sentence " The ship in the harbor is the same as the ship that was in the harbor yesterday " is not elliptical and does not require the insertion of a general term after " same . " If what I have been saying is right , Chisholm can not assume that the individual composita that constitute a ship will satisfy the definition of " ship , " and he needs some other way of specifying these composita if he is to make out his claim that ships can be regarded as logical constructions upon evolving systems of composita . I turn now to Chisholm 's other claim about such things as ships , namely that the criteria for the identity of such things are " defeasible and a matter only of convention , " and his claim that this constitutes a difference between the identity of such things and the identity of persons . I shall begin with a truism or two . First of all , there is a familiar sense in which the meaning of any word whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 2Some of the difficulties in it have been very ably brought out in an unpublished paper by John Perry .  | being the same 0 is always determined at least in part by the meaning of the word " 0 , " there is a sense in which all criteria of identity are conventional . If " person " meant what is in fact meant by " ship , " the criteria for the identity of what then would be called " persons " would obviously be different from the criteria for the identity of what are now called " persons . " But also , there is no word that is immune to change in meaning . And since , again , the meaning of a word determines , at least in part , the identity conditions for the things to which the word applies , there is a sense , a rather trivial and uninteresting one , in which all criteria of identity are " defeasible " in the sense of being alterable by convention . All of this applies just as much to the word " person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely that Chisholm would disagree with what I have just said , it would appear that he must have in mind conventions other than those that determine the meanings of the terms " ship " and " person " when he says that the criteria of ship identity are " a matter only of convention " and denies that this is true of the criteria of personal identity . It seems to me that the truth value of statements about the identity of such things as ships sometimes is and sometimes is not determined in part by conventions that can be changed without changing , or changing significantly , the meanings of the expressions involved . Consider the sentence " The building Jones is in is the same as the building Smith is in . " And suppose , to begin with , that Jones and Smith are situated just as Professor Chisholm and I are situated at present . Here , I think , the empirical facts together with the meanings of the terms in that sentence determine that the statement expressed by the sentence is true . Given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no room for the operation of any other convention in determining the truth value of the statement . The only way of " defeating " this identity statement , given the facts , is by changing the meaning of the word " building " or of some other word or words . In this sense we can also " defeat " any statement of personal identity . But of course it is misleading to say that one is defeating a statement if what one is doing is changing the meaning of a sentence so that instead of expressing that statement it expresses a different statement that is false . Consider , however , a different sort of case : Suppose that Jones is in Alpha Hall and Smith is in Beta  | Hall , and that Alpha Hall and Beta Hall are joined at some point so that it is possible to get from one to the other without being rained on . Here I am inclined to say that the facts together with the meanings of the words " building , " " same , " etc. do not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had been in the practice of saying in such cases that the people were in different buildings , and if for some reason we altered our practice , I would be hesitant about saying that we had changed the meaning of the word " building . " Here there seems to be room for the operation of conventions other than those that define the meanings of the words , or at any rate conventions that can be changed without significantly altering the meanings of the words . It is such conventions as these that I will call " defeasible . " In the cases just considered , the identity asserted is what might be called " identity through space " rather than identity through time . It may be Chisholm 's view that all statements asserting the identity of a physical thing through time are like my second example of an assertion of identity through space rather than like my first example , i.e. , are such that their truth values depend on defeasible conventions . But I do not believe that this view is correct . Consider the statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the building we were in when Professor Chisholm began to read his paper . " Anyone who knew the facts and seriously disputed this statement would thereby be convicted of lack of understanding of one or more of the expressions in the sentence used to make the statement . And if we all changed our practice of making identity statements so that in cases like this we would say that the building we are in now is numerically different from the one we were in half an hour ago , I think this would have to be described as a change , and a fairly substantial change , in the meaning of the word " building , " or in the meanings of other words . But there certainly are cases in which the empirical facts together with the meanings of words do not unequivocally determine the truth value of statements asserting identity through time ; Chisholm 's example of the U.S.S. South Dakota seems to me such a case . And I think that the conventions determining the truth value of statements asserting identity through time are more often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of degree , are typically more defeasible ? than those governing the truth conditions of statements asserting identity through space . The reasons for this are interesting , but I do not have the space to go into them here . ' In any case , Chisholm is certainly right in thinking that some of the conventions governing the truth conditions of identity statements about such things as ships and buildings are defeasible conventions . I have not been operating here with anything like a theory about " sameness of meaning " or a criterion for saying whether the 3Very briefly , I think this has to do with the fact that when " 0 " is a word like " ship , " or " building , " the ability we regard as most central to knowing the meaning of " 43 " is the ability to identify or classify things as 0 's and distinguish 4 ) ' s from non-4 , ' s . Having this ability typically involves knowing a good deal about how something must be distributed in space in order to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the features by which things are classified as falling under such concepts ? and it therefore involves knowing , at least for a large class of cases , the truth conditions of statements of the form " The 4 ) at place p and the 43 at place p ' are one and the same . " But , while something 's being correctly classifiable as a building depends on its being distributed in space in a certain way , it does not depend in any comparable way on how the thing is distributed in time . What " temporal size " something has ( i.e. , how long it exists ) has little to do with whether it is correctly said to be a building . And , as Judith Thomson has pointed out ( in " Time , Space and Objects , " Mind , January , 1965 ) , if we introduce a notion of temporal shape that parallels our ordinary notion of spatial shape , it turns out that the temporal shapes of things play no role in our classifications of them into kinds . Hence knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 4 , at t and the 4 , at t ' are one and the same " does not play the central role in classification and identification that is played by knowledge of the truth conditions of statements of the form " The 43 at place p and the 4 ) at place p ' are one and the same . " What I have said of course gives no answer to the deeper question of why we classify things in such a way that there is this asymmetry between identity through space and identity through time , which I think is much the same as the question of why we operate with an ontology , or conceptual scheme , in which the basic particulars , to use Strawson 's term , are threedimensional objects rather than four-dimensional objects . I think that this has to do in part with the difficulty of applying the four-dimensional view to persons . For discussions relevant to the points touched on here , see Michael Woods 's " Identity and Individuation " in Analytical Philosophy , ed . R. J. Butler ( 2d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judith Thomson mentioned above .  | meaning of a word has changed " significantly . " I have simply been following my vague intuitions regarding these notions , one of which is that it would not be natural to say that British judges mean something different by " ship " from what American judges mean simply because , what is imaginable , British courts rule that the wooden ship is the U.S.S. South Dakota while American courts rule that the aluminum ship is the U.S.S. South Dakota . And it does seem to me that it must be at least part of what Chisholm means in calling the criteria of ship identity " defeasible " that they rest on conventions that we can change without significantly altering the meaning of the word " ship . " For , as I have been insisting , if a change of convention that alters identity conditions by changing the meaning of a word is allowed to count as " defeating " a criterion of identity , the criteria of personal identity will be as defeasible as any others . Now I think , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is by and large true that the criteria of personal identity differ from those of ship identity in not being defeasible and alterable by convention . At first I thought that this is because the concept of a person is to a considerable extent defined , or constituted , by the criteria of personal identity , and that for this reason any attempt to make a substantial change in these criteria is likely to succeed only in changing the meaning of the word " person , " i.e. , making it express a different concept from what it does now . The suggestion is that the criteria of personal identity are much more central to the concept of a person than are the criteria of ship identity to the concept of a ship , and that this accounts for the difference Butler and Chisholm see . But while I still think that this is part of the story , I do not think that it is the whole of it . Part of the difference , I think , consists in , or is accounted for by , a difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind we have in the identity of other sorts of things . Chisholm says at one point that part of what is meant by saying that the criteria of ship identity are defeasible is that " we reserve to ourselves the right of revising these criteria should they turn out to sanction uses that would be inconvenient or otherwise undesirable . " This recognizes the important fact that identity judgments have social consequences , which we may or may not find to be in accord with our interests . What we need  | to understand is why it is that judgments of ship identity can have consequences that are undesirable in such a way as to make it reasonable to change the criteria of ship identity and thereby avoid having to make such judgments , whereas this does not seem to be true in the case of personal identity . Both identity judgments about persons and identity judgments about other things have social consequences . It is the car that is judged to be identical with the one I bought last year that I am now regarded as having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is the person who is judged to be identical with the person who bought that car who now is regarded as having such a right to its use . And , of course , it is the person who is judged to be identical with the person who committed the crime last year who will now be punished for it . But our interest in personal identity is not related to our interest in the social consequences of judgments of personal identity in the same way as our interest in the identity of such things as cars and ships is related to our interest in the social consequences of identity judgments about them . Suppose that I am concerned , as indeed I am , that my car , the one I have now , be in good condition tomorrow . I may , of course , have a sentimental attachment to my car , but my primary interest is in being the beneficiary tomorrow of the social consequences of the general acceptance of a judgment to the effect that a car then in good condition is identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? the desired consequence is my having at my disposal tomorrow a car in good condition . Here I might say , oversimplifying just a bit , " I do n't care which car of tomorrow is judged to be identical with this one , as long as it is in good condition . " But compare this with my concern that I be in good condition tomorrow , that I be healthy , prosperous , and happy . Here it would seem absurd to say , " I do n't care which self of tomorrow is judged to be identical with me , as long as that self is healthy , prosperous and happy . " And while I certainly am not indifferent to the social consequences of the identity judgments I expect to be made about me tomorrow , it is not at all because of these consequences that I have concern for my future welfare . I am inclined to say , " What I want is not that the self of tomorrow who is judged to be me , or who is counted as being me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that the self of tomorrow who is me should be healthy , prosperous , and happy . "  | This bears on Chisholm 's ingenious and intriguing elaboration of Peirce 's operation example . You will recall that it is proposed to someone that we prevent him from suffering the pain of an operation by modifying the criteria of personal identity in such a way that the person who suffers the pain will not count as him , i.e. , will not count the same as the person who had the same body before and after the operation . A natural response to this remarkable proposal would be to say , " Zook , what I am interested in is not whether the person who suffers the pain is going to be called me , or counted as me , or regarded as me ; what I am interested in is whether he will be me . " One would not be likely to make a corresponding distinction between one 's interest in whether the car that will be damaged tomorrow will be counted or regarded as identical with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaged car will be identical with one 's present car . And this difference may seem to lend support to the view that the identity of such things as cars is conventional in the sense that whatever is generally counted as being the same car is being the same car , while personal identity is not conventional in this sense . What we need to clarify is the nature of the interest we have in personal identity , and in particular the nature of the special concern that each of us has for his own future welfare . So far I have made about this only the negative point that this interest is quite unlike the interest we have in the identity of things qua items of property . In trying to understand the nature of this concern for future welfare , and its relation to the concept of personal identity , it is helpful to try to imagine people whose attitudes toward their future selves is different from our own . To this end I shall , with apologies , ask you to consider an imaginary tribe . The members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like us only more selfish : they are thoroughgoing rational egoists who have concern for the welfare of others only when they think this affects their own welfare . The important exception is this : at all times except during the twilight hours the members of this tribe are completely indifferent to what their own welfare will be during the twilight hours , except as they view this as affecting their welfare at other times , and each member of the tribe shows ( except during the twilight hours ) a concern for the welfare during the twilight hours of some other member  | of the tribe , say the neighbor who lives on his right , this concern being exactly like the concern he has for his own welfare at other times . If a member of the tribe finds ( during the nontwilight hours ) that others are preparing to torture him when twilight falls , he shows no fear and makes no attempt to prevent this , unless he thinks that the torture will cause him pain or bodily damage that will last past the twilight hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing to torture his right-hand neighbor when twilight falls , he makes every effort to prevent this , and if he is unsuccessful he shows increasing fear as twilight approaches . Members of the tribe who have to undergo operations attempt to schedule them during the twilight hours , so as to avoid the cost of anesthesia , though of course their left-hand neighbors try to prevent this . And each member of the tribe attempts to make provisions to insure that his right-hand neighbor is provided with food and drink , and other pleasures , during the twilight hours ? though in doing this he is faced with the difficulty that if he makes his right-hand neighbor a gift prior to twilight his neighbor is likely to pass on the gift to his right-hand neighbor . I am imagining that these attitudes are as natural to these people as any of our attitudes are to us , and that no amount of argument will persuade any of them that it is not simply incredible that during the nontwilight hours he should have any concern , except perhaps a general humanitarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first observation I would like to make about this example is that it does not seem to me right to say that the members of this imaginary tribe would be unreasonable or irrational . Granted , their conduct will seem irrational if judged by our standards of rationality , but I can see no sense in applying our standards of rationality to creatures who are as different from us as these creatures are imagined to be . And after all , it is not as if we have reasons for saying that our standards of rationality are themselves rational . Given what my imaginary people naturally want and strive for , I think they would not be misusing the word " rational " if they described someone as rational if he passed up some present good in order to provide a greater good for his righthand neighbor during the twilight hours , and if they described someone else as irrational because by some shortsighted action  | he made it possible for himself to avoid being exploited by his neighbor during the twilight hours . ' The second observation I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the people in my imaginary tribe do not regard their twilight-hour selves as really being themselves . I shall not try to argue this ; as Chisholm says about something else , either you see it or you do n't . If you accept it you will perhaps agree with me that having a special regard for the welfare of a future self is part of what it is to regard that self as oneself . Wittgenstein suggested , if I understand him , that the " belief " that others have souls is at least partly a matter of having a certain sort of attitude toward others . I am making a similar suggestion , and I am afraid a similarly vague suggestion , about first-person beliefs in personal identity . A third observation , following upon the last one , is that if my imaginary tribe started off using our criteria of personal identity ? let us take these to be bodily continuity and continuity of memory ? it would not be surprising if they elected to change these criteria somewhat so as to bring their judgments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so as to permit them to say that at twilight a man " becomes , " takes over the body and memories of , his right-hand neighbor . For obvious reasons the social consequences of judgments of personal identity made in accordance with our criteria of personal identity would often be unacceptable to my imaginary people ; for one thing , they would prefer that during the twilight hours each man should have a legally enforceable right to the use of goods acquired by his lefthand neighbor at other times . Of course , instead of changing their criteria of personal identity they might change their insti- 4There is one difficulty here . We would not ordinarily allow that a man had acted rationally if he knew , or should have known , that he would subsequently regret his action . Yet the members of my tribe regularly do things that they know that they will regret during the twilight hours . But I think that the sense in which these people regret their previous actions during the twilight hours is not quite our ordinary sense of " regret . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking that his previous actions involved a mistake , or miscalculation , or shortsightedness , or weakness of will , nor will it involve resolving to behave differently in the future ? for the members of the tribe know that resolves formed during the twilight hours have no effect on their behavior at other times .  | tutions of property and punishment so that judgments of personal identity would have different social consequences . Which they would do , I suppose , would depend on which they regarded as more central to the notion of personal identity : its connections with the notions of bodily continuity and memory , or its connections with such notions as that of moral responsibility and that of a right to the possession and use of something . It does not seem to me that there is any clear sense in which they could be said to be mistaken in making either of these changes , or in which they could be mistaken in making one of the changes ( in the criteria , or in the institutions ) rather than the other . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this and would say that the question whether a man in the twilight hours would be the same as the man who at other times has the same body must have a correct answer that is independent of whatever conventions these people adopt , and that this is so whether or not it is possible to determine what that correct answer is . What I have tried to imagine in describing this hypothetical tribe is a case in which there is a breakdown in a correlation that with us is fairly constant ? a correlation between , on the one hand , a person X having at time t a special concern for the welfare of person Y at a later time t ' , and , on the other , its being the case , or X 's believing it to be the case , that our ordinary criteria of personal identity would give the verdict that person X at t and person Y at t ' are one and the same person . The final point I wish to make about this example is that it is essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a fairly limited one . What it is not possible to imagine , I believe , is a tribe each member of which never shows any concern for his own future welfare , or for what our usual criteria of personal identity would require us to call his future welfare , but does show a concern for the future welfare of some other member of the tribe . I have not the space to show in detail how an attempt to give a coherent description of such a tribe would break down , but several points should be noted . First , I think that to have no regard for one 's future welfare would amount to ' having no concern for one 's welfare at all . The future is continuous with the present , and even trying to get rid of a pain one now has is showing concern for one 's future welfare . If we try to imagine that  | these people never behave in ways that show concern for their future welfare , we will have to imagine that they never behave in ways that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already calls into question the claim that it is people one is imagining . But also , if there is nothing the people in this tribe find pleasant or unpleasant , nothing they want to get and keep for themselves , then the notion of welfare seems to have no application to them , and in that case it can not after all be part of the description of the case that each member of the tribe has a concern for the future welfare of some other member of the tribe . It is also worth noting that such notions as that of fear would have no application to the members of this tribe , for fear as we know it is a primitive form of concern for one 's own future welfare . I think that such considerations as these show that if we try to describe a set of people whose behavior does not show concern for their own future welfare , or what would be judged to be their future welfare on the basis of our present criteria of personal identity , we will find that nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we have described can not be called people at all . It is , I think , not merely true but conceptually true that there are close connections between personal identity , as judged by our usual criteria , and the various attitudes and emotions I have been calling " special concern for future welfare . " The connection between these perhaps need not be as tight as it is with us , i.e. , the subject of the special concern perhaps need not invariably be identical with the person who is its object , but I think we can not describe a case in which it is systematically absent without significantly changing the meaning of the word " person . " In this connection it is worth noticing a connection between having concern for one 's future welfare and having the sort of memory knowledge each of us has of his own past . Concern for one 's future welfare is manifested in purposive activity , which typically occurs over a period of time and involves the performance of sequences of actions that stand in complex means-ends relationships to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of its own past , including its own past intentions , could engage in such behavior . One difficulty that would be faced by the members of the imaginary tribe I described earlier is that during the twilight hours a man would have no memory knowledge  | of the past actions and intentions of his left-hand neighbor , and so would be hampered in his attempts to carry to completion enterprises that his neighbor had initiated in his behalf . If we try to imagine a general breakdown in the correlation between remembering the actions and intentions of a past self and being the self for whose welfare that past self had special concern , we have to imagine the absence of the very sort of purposive behavior in which this concern ought to manifest itself . Now let us try to see how all this applies to Chisholm 's claim that in its application to persons , as contrasted with its application to other things , the concept of identity is not subject to convention . I have already suggested that there are conceivable circumstances in which it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to decide questions of personal identity differently from ways they had done this in the past . This would be so if , as in the case of my imaginary tribe , the future selves that they had special concern for were frequently not the future selves their old criteria of identity would require them to speak of as their future selves , and if as a result of this the social consequences of identity judgments made on the basis of those criteria were less acceptable to them than would be the social consequences of identity judgments based on some altered set of criteria . But of course our actual situation is not at all like this . The future selves we have special concern for are the future selves that our criteria of identity require us to regard as ourselves , and I have suggested that we run into conceptual difficulties if we try to imagine people who are very different from us in this respect . Our judgments of personal identity are already in line with our attitudes , so there is no need for a convention that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the criteria of personal identity might be to the advantage of a few individuals , e.g. , it might enable someone to escape punishment for a crime . But if there is any truth in the claims made for justice , and for the practices that dictate the social consequences of judgments of personal identity , such a change would not produce consequences that would be acceptable to people in general . One true thing that can be meant by the claim that the criteria of personal identity are not alterable by convention is that , given our interests and attitudes , and given the social consequences of judgments of personal identity , any change in the criteria that made a difference would be  | a change for the worse . This can be viewed as a moral point . Ships and automobiles have no interests , and we are free to treat them as means and to alter their criteria of identity as suits our convenience . But unless we are willing to treat persons as mere things , we can not change the criteria of personal identity without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think that if we take these interests properly into account any change that would make a difference will be ruled out . One way of expressing the point I have been trying to make is by saying that if possible our criteria of personal identity ought to be such as to make true the proposition " The future selves that people have a direct and special concern for are the future selves they regard as themselves . " But this is not the only proposition our criteria ought to make true . Suppose that a proposed criterion of personal identity gave the verdict that actions I remember doing ? or , if you like , seem to remember doing ? usually were done by someone other than myself , and that intentions I form are usually carried out by someone other than myself . Assuming that other criteria are available that do not have these bizarre consequences , I think we could say that the proposed new criterion would not be a criterion of personal identity at all , and that anyone who insisted on applying the expression " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have changed the meaning of the word " person . " Part of acquiring the concept of a person is learning the use of the first-person pronouns , and learning the use of these pronouns is inseparable from learning to make a wide variety of first-person statements ? memory statements , statements of intention , statements expressing desire and fear , and so on . The concepts of such forward-looking and backward-looking mental states as fear , desire , intention , memory , and regret all involve the concept of personal identity , and I think that acquiring these concepts involves coming to accept as true such propositions as : " If what a person fears happens , it is usually that person who is harmed , " " If a person decides to do something , and what he decides to do gets done as the result of his decision , then ( generally ) it is that person who does it , " and " If a person seems to remember doing a past action of a certain description as the result of someone 's having done an action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who did the action . " Perhaps none of these propositions is by itself straight-  | forwardly analytic or logically necessary . But I think that such propositions as these , and the proposition that persons have special concern for their own future welfare , are constitutive of the concept of a person at least in the sense that they provide a standard of acceptability for criteria of personal identity . The best set of criteria would be one that made all of these propositions true , and if some set of criteria satisfies this condition then any other competing set of criteria , any set that makes one or more of these propositions false , can on that account be rejected . If this is right then we can perhaps say that the reason why the criteria of personal identity are not alterable by convention is simply that our actual criteria conform to this standard and any revision of them is for that reason ruled out . The fact that our actual criteria satisfy this standard of acceptability consists in part in the fact that they permit us , i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have a special sort of knowledge of their own identities . It is characteristic of certain kinds of first-person statements that while they imply statements of personal identity , or at any rate imply the persistence of a person through time , they are not normally grounded on criteria of identity . I have argued at length elsewhere that this is true of first-person memory reports . ' And it seems clearly true of statements of intention ; it seems obvious that my statement that I will go to a concert this evening does not rest on my having identified as myself , by means of criteria of identity , someone who will go to the concert . But , while such statements are not grounded on criteria , they can be judged to be true or false ( by others , or by ourselves in retrospect ) on the basis of criteria ; and a person 's ability to learn to make such statements ? and to have the sorts of knowledge they express ? consists mainly in the fact that he can be taught , or trained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity and yet are for the most part true if judged by our present criteria of identity . And whereas people are in fact such that they can be trained to make , without using criteria , statements about themselves that conform to our present criteria , they are not such that they can learn to make , without using criteria , statements that conform to criteria that conflict with our present criteria . We 5See my Self-Knowledge and Self-Identity ( Ithaca , N.Y. , 1963 ) , esp . chap . 4.  | can imagine people ( or creatures ) who can be taught to make , without using criteria , first-person judgments that conform to criteria of identity that are wildly incompatible with ours , but such people would be very different from ourselves . Given the way persons in fact are , only our present criteria of personal identity permit us to ascribe to persons an important sort of selfknowledge , and this is one reason why these criteria do not strike us as arbitrary or as subject to change , although the fact that having this self-knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or any others ) makes it appear that personal identity transcends its criteria . But what of cases , such as Chisholm 's fission example , where our present criteria of personal identity do not seem to decide questions of personal identity ? I am not as convinced as Chisholm is that if my body were to undergo fission it is out of the question that I would be both the person who goes off to the right and the person who goes off to the left . ' But this is too complicated a question to be examined here . In any case , I agree with Chisholm that in such cases it would be unreasonable to let one 's hopes and fears concerning one 's own future welfare be influenced by the adoption , even by the highest authorities , of a convention determining the application of the concept of identity to persons . I said earlier that our criteria of identity ought to be such as to make true the proposition " The future selves that people naturally have a direct and special concern for the welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I think that making this proposition true has got to consist in bringing our criteria in line with our attitudes of concern rather than bringing our attitudes of concern in line with some arbitrarily adopted convention or criterion . Our attitudes of concern are simply not modifiable in this way by the adoption of conventions governing the truth conditions of statements , and if someone 's attitudes were modifiable in this way I would want to say either that he was confused ? e.g. , that he was confusedly treating a convention as if it were a statement of fact ? or else that he was psychologically so different from us that our standards of rationality and reasonableness would not apply to him . There is one thing that puzzles me about Chisholm 's position . 6For a defense of the view that this is not out of the question , see A. N. Prior , " ' Opposite Number , ' " Review of Metaphysics , 1957 , and " Time , Existence and Identity . "  | The force of much of what he says at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one 's own future welfare that is the primary focus of one 's hopes and fears , and I think he takes it for granted that we have , and that it is natural and reasonable for us to have , a special kind of concern for our own future welfare that we do not have for the future welfare of others . But does he regard this as an analytic truth or as a synthetic truth ? If he thinks that it is a synthetic truth , it is not clear to me why he is so confident that it would hold in circumstances , such as his fission case , that are vastly different from any we have encountered or have any likelihood of encountering . Supposing that I could be persuaded , by considerations having to do with the transitivity of identity , that it is quite impossible that both products of the fission of my body will be me , it is not clear that it would be unreasonable for me to say , " Still and all , I feel an equal concern , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both these future persons ; I view with fear and dread the sufferings of the one , and at the same time I view with delighted anticipation the rich and happy life of the other . " To be sure , there does seem something logically peculiar about saying that one dreads , or views with delighted anticipation , a future happening in which one believes that one will not oneself be involved . And this may suggest that it is a logical or analytic truth , rather than a synthetic truth , that the object of one 's special concern for future welfare ( of which dread and delighted anticipation are determinate forms ) has to be one 's own future welfare . But I am not sure that it is open to Chisholm to hold this . The claim that this is an analytic truth might be supported by arguments , of the sort sketched earlier , to show that there are conceptual connections between concern for future welfare and the empirically discoverable relationships , such as bodily continuity and continuity of memory , that we use as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand him , thinks that the relationship between personal identity and these criteria is a synthetic one , and on this view it would not follow from there being an analytic relationship between special concern for future welfare and our usual criteria of personal identity that there is an analytic relationship between special concern for future welfare and personal identity itself . If one holds , as I think Bishop Butler did , that personal identity consists in an unanalyzable substantial unity that is only synthetically connected with any of our usual  | criteria of personal identity , it is difficult to see how it could be analytically true that people have , or that it is reasonable for them to have , a special concern for their own future welfare . Indeed , it is hard for me to see why on that view it should be true at all that one should be concerned about one 's future welfare when , as must be possible on that view , the future delights and sufferings are not linked to one 's " present self " by our present criteria of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leibniz , who wrote the following in his Discourse on Metaphysics ( XXXIV ) : " Suppose that some individual could suddenly become King of China on condition , however , of forgetting what he had been , as though being born again , would it not amount to the same practically , or as far as the effects could be perceived , as if the individual were annihilated , and a King of China were at the same instant created in his place ? The individual would have no reason to desire this . "  | Mr. Shoemaker 's careful and penetrating observations indicate that there are many respects in which my paper requires clarification and correction . As a result of his criticisms , I feel far more clear about the problems involved than I had before . But I also feel that the fundamental theses of the paper , which I had attributed to Bishop Butler , are sound and that Shoemaker has not succeeded in " explaining them away . " I can not do justice to everything he has said . I shall consider just his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said about nonpersons , and secondly as they apply to what I said about persons . To deal with the questions Shoemaker raises about " evolving composita , " let us use the following diagram to schematize the history of the U.S.S. South Dakota : Figure We may suppose that a is the compositum of the first day ; one part is replaced , so that on the second day a " directly evolves " into b ; and so on , with the result that compositum f of the sixth day , though it has " indirectly evolved " from a , has no parts in common with a . But though the compositum of the sixth day is thus different from the compositum of the first day , and from those of the other four days , we may yet say that the ship of the sixth day is identical with the ship of the first day and with that of the other four days : the U.S.S. South Dakota has persisted  | all along . One of Shoemaker 's questions may now be put as " Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Let us agree , for simplicity , that Webster has provided us with an acceptable definition of " a ship " : x is a ship , we may say , if and only if x is used for transportation in water . And let us assume that each of the six composita depicted above is ( or was ) used for transportation in water . It will follow , therefore , that each of six composita is a ship . And so , as Shoemaker points out , we are now confronted with a philosophical problem . The problem might be summarized by asking : " How are we going to be able to say consistently that each of the six different cornposita is a ship and yet that there is only one ship , only one U.S.S. South Dakota ? And how are we going to be able to say consistently that though the ship of the first day is identical with the ship of the sixth day , the compositum that constitutes the ship of the first day is not identical with the compositum that constitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " x is a ship " allows us to say that each of our six composita is a ship . We need a definition of " x constitutes the same ship as does y " which will allow us to say that our six different composita , our six different ships , constitute the same ship . Hence the definition of our second concept should not imply " x is identical with y " since the six composita that constitute the same ship are not identical with each other . Nor should the definition imply " x is diverse from y " since we want to be able to say , after all , that x constitutes the same ship as does y . ( Finding an acceptable definition of " x is a ship " is a problem for dictionary-makers . Their definition , if it is not merely a description of how certain people at a certain time use the expression " is a ship , " will be a convention , and like any such convention it will be subject to revision . Finding an acceptable definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is more likely to be a problem for jurists . Their decision will be a decree and , like any such decree , will be subject to defeat . Both types of definition might be called " conventions , " but they are conventions of rather different sorts . Shoemaker remarks , correctly , that " Chisholm ... must have in mind conventions other than those that determine the meanings of the terms ship ' and person ' when he says that the criteria of ship identity are a matter only of convention '  | and denies that this is true of the criteria of personal identity . " I was concerned with the conventions involved in " x constitutes the same ship as does y " and " x constitutes the same person as does y , " and not with those involved in " x is a ship " and " x is a person . " But I was not sufficiently clear about the distinction . It is quite possible for people to agree about a definition of " x is a ship " while disagreeing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or to agree about the latter and to disagree about the former . Shoemaker is right in saying that " it would not be natural to say that British judges mean something different by ship ' from what American judges mean simply because , what is imaginable , British courts rule that the wooden ship is the U.S.S. South Dakota while American courts rule that the aluminum ship is the U.S.S. South Dakota . " In the situation imagined , the two courts have the same interpretation of " x is a ship " and different interpretations of " x constitutes the same ship as does y . " ) I had proposed in my paper a definition of " x constitutes the same ship as does y . " So far as our actual usage is concerned , the definition is oversimplified . Let us ignore this oversimplification for the moment ( just as we are ignoring the fact that Webster 's definition of " ship " is oversimplified ) , for I wish to suggest that the definition gives us a kind of " model " which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Theseus and of the U.S.S. South Dakota . The definition may be put as follows : x constitutes at t the same ship that y constitutes at t ' , provided only : x is a ship at t , y is a ship at t ' , and every z such that z evolves from x and y evolves from z , or such that z evolves from y and x evolves from z , is also a ship . ' The definition allows for the possibility that x is diverse from y ; it also allows for the possibility that x is identical with y.2 Given this definition of " constituting the same ship , " we may now define what it is to constitute the U.S.S. South Dakota : ' The original definition , however , lacked the clause beginning with " or " and used Webster 's definiens in place of " a ship . " To avoid the problem of fission ( the problem of having to say of two ships that they are both the U.S.S. South Dakota at one and the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " No such z directly evolves into more than one ship . " 2In defining what it is to say that one compositum " evolves " from another , I had said : " For simplicity , let us misuse the term evolves ' so that we may also say that any given compositum evolves from itself . "  | x constitutes the U.S.S. South Dakota at t , provided only : x is a ship at t , and everything that constitutes the same ship that x constitutes at t is a U.S.S. South Dakota . This definition may be said to presuppose that " U.S.S. South Dakota , " when taken in a strict and philosophical sense , is a generic name.3 The name may apply to more than one thing but not to more than one thing at a time ; and if it applies to two things , one of them must have evolved from the other . ( If the lady who christens the ship were to speak in a strict and philosophical sense , she would say : " I hereby christen everything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dakota . ' " ) Some of the things that are true of the U.S.S. South Dakota are true of the particular composita that constitute it ; thus if a is grey and 400 feet long on the first day , so is the U.S.S. South Dakota . And some of the things that are true of the U.S.S. South Dakota are not true of the particular composita that make it up ; thus the U.S.S. South Dakota endures for six days , but each of its composita endures for only one . But those true statements in which something is predicated of the U.S.S. South Dakota that may not be predicated of any of its composita may be paraphrased into true statements in which something is predicated of its composita . This is what I meant when I said that the U.S.S. South Dakota is a " logical construction " upon its composita . To say that the U.S.S. South Dakota persisted from Sunday through Friday , for example , will be to say something like this : There was a compositum which was a ship and a U.S.S. South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutes on Friday the same ship which that compositum constituted on Monday . With this " model " in mind , let us now attempt to deal with the kind of difficulties Shoemaker has called attention to . When we say , in connection with the composita of our example , " There are six different ships , " we are speaking in what Bishop Butler would call a strict and philosophical sense . But when we say , " There is only one ship , " we are speaking in what he would call a loose and popular sense . A more strict and philosophical formu- 3Cf . Hume : " Tho ' we commonly be able to distinguish pretty exactly betwixt numerical and specific identity , yet it sometimes happens that we confound them , and in our thinking and reasoning employ the one for the other " ( A Treatise of Human Nature , Book I , Part IV , sec. vi " Of Personal Identity " , Selby-Bigge edition , pp. 257-58 ) .  | lation of the second statement would be : " There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore the first of our two statements does not contradict the second . When we say , " The ship which is the U.S.S. ' South Dakota on the first day is not identical with the ship which is the U.S.S. South Dakota on the sixth day , " we are speaking again in what Butler would call a strict and philosophical sense . But when we say , " The ship that is the U.S.S. South Dakota on the first day is identical with the ship that is the U.S.S. South Dakota on the sixth day , " we are speaking in what he would call a loose and popular sense . A more strict and philosophical formulation of the second statement would be : " The ship that constitutes the U.S.S. South Dakota on the first day constitutes the same ship as does the ship that constitutes the U.S.S. South Dakota on the sixth day . " Therefore , once again , the first statement does not contradict the second . And when we say , " The ship that is the U.S.S. South Dakota on the first day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same strict and philosophical sense . But when we say , " The ship that is the U.S.S. South Dakota on the first day persisted for six days , " we are speaking in the loose and popular sense . A more strict and philosophical formulation would be : " There is something x that constitutes the U.S.S. South Dakota on the sixth day and there is ( or was ) something y that constitutes on the first day the same ship that x constitutes on the sixth day . " And so here , too , the first of our two statements does not contradict the second . Hume said we have a " propensity " to " substitute the notion of identity , instead of that of related objects . " 4 In application to ships , his point might be put by saying that we have a propensity to substitute the notion of one ship for that of related objects constituting the same ship . Using language in a loose and popular sense , we say things that are true ? but things that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophical sense . Then , becoming philosophical , or semiphilosophical , we try to take these things in their strict and philosophical sense and we then encounter contradictions . I would say , therefore , that the way to treat the problem of the 4lbid. , p. 254.  | ship of Theseus and that of the U.S.S. South Dakota ( and the other puzzles I mentioned at the beginning of my original paper ) is to note such things as these.5 It should be emphasized that , in saying of the various uses just discussed that they are loose and popular rather than strict and philosophical , I am not suggesting that they are incorrect . Indeed , they may be said to be correct , for it is the loose and popular interpretation rather than the strict and philosophical one that gives us the standard of correctness ( at any rate , in the loose and popular sense of " correctness " ) . The adequacy of the foregoing account of the problem of the ship of Theseus will depend upon the adequacy of our definitions , in particular of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutes at t the same ship that y constitutes at t ' . " These are admittedly oversimple . I feel certain , however , that the refinements needed to make them adequate would not affect in principle what we have said . The problems involved in defining " x is a ship " are surely immaterial . And there is room for substantial revision of the definition of " x constitutes the same ship that y does " just so long as we continue to take it in such a way that it implies " x is a ship and y is a ship " and does not imply " x is identical with y " or " x is diverse from y . " The proposed definition , or criterion , of " x constitutes at t the same ship that y constitutes at t ' " presupposes the persistence of some entity through some period of time , in the strict and philosophical sense . That is to say , it presupposes that there is some x which is such that we can say " x at t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is identical with " is taken in the strict and philosophical sense . For the definition makes use of the concept of " evolves " ; but in order for one compositum to evolve from another , I had said , it must evolve directly from something , and in order for one compositum to evolve directly from another the two com- 51n answer to other questions that Shoemaker raises , I would say that it is possible for a compositum to be a ship , for the compositum like the ship to have planks among its parts , and for these planks in turn to be themselves composita . I would defend this answer in much the way I have attempted to deal with the problems above .  | posita must " have some parts in common . " In other words , if N at t ' directly evolves from A at t , where t ' is later than t , then there is something x such that x was part of A at t and x is part of N at t ' . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of identity of ships through time is even looser than I had suggested . Conceivably , he says , all the " ultimate parts " of a ship may be annihilated at a certain moment and then , a very , very short time later all of them replaced by parts that then came into being ex nihilo.s In this case the two composita would have no parts in common and therefore the later one can not have evolved from the earlier . " Yet , " he observes , " it seems to me very clear that the acceptance of such a physical theory would not lead us to say that for all we know there is a different ship in the harbor every minute or so . " I would venture to say , though , that if in such a case we are justified in saying that the ship that is in the harbor now is the same as the one that was there a moment ago , it is because of the persistence of some x through time in the strict and philosophical sense ? some x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be identical , in the strict and philosophical sense , with x at another time . We must say either : ( 1 ) that some other physical thing , e.g. , the harbor , or the dock , or the buildings on the dock , evolved in the way that I suggested , so that with each step of evolution some part persists through it ; or ( 2 ) that portions of absolute space , if there is such an entity , persisted through time ( and this would enable us to secure the identity of physical things by reference to their relation to persisting places ) ; or ( 3 ) some observer , some person who has been observing the various physical things involved , has persisted in the strict and philosophical sense through time . But if there is no such strict persistence of 6Shoemaker notes that my account presupposes the infinite divisibility of matter and observes that " we can not rule out a priori that the best theory will turn out to be one according to which the elementary particles are extensionless and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to do justice to this objection . But I would say ( I ) that we can rule out a priori the possibility of arriving at something unextended merely by dividing up things that are extended , and ( 2 ) that if " the best theory " tells us that " the elementary particles are extensionless , " then the relation of these particles to that of the macroscopic objects with which we are familiar is not that of part to whole .  | any of these entities , then , I think , it would make no sense to refer to the identity of a material thing through time . I turn now to Shoemaker 's observations about the identity of persons through time . He has convinced me that there was at least one mistake involved in my speculations about the possibility of fission . I had said this : If you know that your body will undergo fission , that the person who goes off to the right will lead a life of happiness , and that the person who goes off to the left will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that you will be the one on the right and not the one on the left . But I agree with Shoemaker 's suggestion that the one hope is , as such , really no more reasonable than the other . Instead of saying , " It will be reasonable of you to hope that you will be the one on the right , " I should have said , " If you have a more special concern for the future welfare of yourself than for that of any other person , then it would be reasonable to hope that you will be the one on the right . " 7 But I am more reluctant to accept Shoemaker 's positive observations about such " special concern . " It is sometimes said that there are " two main competing answers " to the question " What are the criteria for the identity of a person through time ? , " one being that " the criterion of the identity of a person is the identity of the body which he has , " and the other being that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of memories which he has . " 8 For purposes of abbreviation , we might call these " the bodily criterion " and " the memory criterion , " respectively . Shoemaker , as I interpret him , is now proposing a third , which we might refer to as " the special concern criterion . " He writes : " I-laving a special regard for the welfare of a future self is part of what it is to regard that self as oneself . " Certainly 70r , more accurately : " It would be unreasonable for a man , at one and the same time , both ( 1 ) to have a more special concern for his own future welfare than for that of anyone else , and also ( 2 ) to have no concern , in the situation imagined , about the possibility that he might be the one that goes off to the left . " 8See Terence Penelhum 's article , " Personal Identity , " in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy , ed . Paul Edwards ( New York , 1967 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what one takes one 's future self to be . If we find , for example , that Mr. Nixon 's plans for 1970 are all directed toward the comfort and well-being of the man he believes will then occupy the White House , we might do well to infer that he thinks that he himself will be that person . But surely we should not identify ( I ) making a man the object of one 's special concern and ( 2 ) regarding that man as being oneself . What then could we say of mothers , martyrs , patriots , willing slaves , family retainers , and all those other people who , according to common belief , take as the object of their special concern the well-being of others ? the well-being of persons they know to be other than themselves ? If we accept Shoemaker 's criterion , should we say of these people that they are not as altruistic and " selfless " as we had thought ? Should we say that they think they really are those people , or that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now making what we think of ( mistakenly ? ) as being sacrifices ? ( If we must answer these questions affirmatively , then the refutation of " psychological egoism " will be far less simple than most of us now think that it is . ) To understand Shoemaker 's suggestion , let us consider the imaginary tribe he depicts . He tells us , it will be recalled , that " each member of the tribe shows ( except during the twilight hours ) a concern for the welfare during the twilight hours of some other member of the tribe , say the neighbor who lives on his right , this concern being exactly like the concern he has for his own welfare at other times " ( my italics ) . Given what Shoemaker says about the " special concern " criterion , I am not entirely certain how we are to understand this suggestion . There are two rather different possibilities . Consider at most two members of this tribe . Shoemaker 's language suggests that he is envisaging the following situation : ( A ) There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a person who lives on the left side and not on the right , y is a person who lives on the right side and not on the left , and during the day x devotes his special concern to the nocturnal welfare of y . We may say , of the situation described by ( A ) , that in the strict and philosophical sense the x and y involved are different persons . For ( A ) logically entails " x is not identical with y " and there-  | fore , in the strict and philosophical sense , " x is not the same person as y . " And so if x and the other members of his tribe think that x " changes his identity " at night , they are simply deluded . But I think that the situation we are to imagine is more complex . Let us consider this alternative : ( B ) There exists an x , a y , a z , and a w such that : x is a person , y is a person , z @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right side and not on the left , w is a body that is housed day and night on the left side and not on the right , z is the body of x during the day , w is the body of y during the night , and the object of x 's special concern during the day is the nocturnal welfare of y . If the " special concern " criterion is adequate , then ( B ) , taken literally , would imply that a most extraordinary event has taken place . For it would imply that sometime during the twilight hours , between day and night , z ceased to be the body of x , and w began to be the body of x . What kind of happening was this ? Did x transmigrate from z to w , and if so how fast did he go ? Or did he cease to be , while z was his body , and then , contrary to the dicta of Locke and Reid , come into being anew with w as his body ? Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and y , whose bodies were z and w , respectively , and then at some moment during the twilight hours , did x actually come to be identical with this other thing ? ' I can not believe that Shoemaker means us to take his suggestion in this literal manner . How , then , are we to take it ? I believe that this is the proper interpretation : Since each member of the tribe adopts , toward the nocturnal welfare of a person other than himself , the kind of concern that you and I adopt only toward ourselves , he may find it agreeable or convenient to refer to that other person , when discussing that person 's nocturnal affairs , with the kind of linguistic idiom that you and I adopt when we intend to refer only to ourselves . And if these strange people talk in this way , then we may say that , according to their concept of a person , it makes perfectly good sense to say that each person " changes his identity " in the evening . But if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether it makes any sense to say that there were two persons x and y and that x then came to be identical with the other person y.  | to it , ca n't we say simply that they find it agreeable and convenient , on occasion , to say of different persons that they are really the same ? If the people are not deluded , as they were under interpretation ( A ) above , then they are simply pretending . ' ? It should at least be clear from all of this that Shoemaker 's approach to these difficult questions is somewhat different from mine . He is right in saying at the end of his paper that , according to my view , the relationship between personal identity and the various criteria he refers to is " a synthetic one . " He finds it difficult to understand why , on a view such as mine , " it should be true at all that one should be concerned about one 's future welfare when , as must be possible on that view , the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self ' by our present criteria of personal identity . " I agree that there is this possibility on my view . My answer to the question that Shoemaker quotes from Leibniz would be this : Since I am concerned about my future welfare , about the welfare of that x such that x is identical with me , and presumably will continue to have this concern , it will follow that , if I should learn that x will some day become King of China , then , even though I also learn that x will then forget everything that x had previously been , I will be as much concerned about the life that x enjoys while King of China as I am about my own ; for , given our suppositions , x 's welfare will be my own . Where Mr. Shoemaker is inclined to side with Leibniz , I am ' ? Suppose there were a monarchy in which the subjects found it distasteful ever to affirm that the monarch vacated his throne . Instead of saying that there have been so many dozen kings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that the monarch has now existed for many hundreds of years and has had so many dozen different names . At certain times it has been appropriate that these names be masculine , like " George " and " Henry , " and at other times it has been appropriate that they be feminine , like " Victoria " and " Elizabeth . " What , then , if we knew about these people and were to hear such talk as this : " There has existed for many hundreds of years an x such that x is our Monarch ; x is now feminine , though fifty years ago x was masculine , and fifty years before that x was feminine " ? We should not conclude that there was in that land a monarch who is vastly different from any of the people in ours . We should conclude rather that the speaker is either deluded or pretending .  | inclined to side with the following observation of Bayle 's : " The same atoms which compose water , are in ice , in vapours , in clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are in the meal , in the bread , the blood , the flesh , the bones &c.; Were they unhappy under the figure or form of water , and under that of ice , it would be the same numerical substance that would be unhappy in those two conditions ; and consequently all the calamities which are to be dreaded , under the form of meal , concern the atoms which form corn ; and nothing ought to concern itself so much about the state or lot of the meal , as the atoms which form the wheat , though they are not to suffer those calamities , under the form of wheat .

I shall argue here that the logic of our perceptual terms is a branch of modal logic . ' In saying this , I mean by " perceptual terms " both such words as " sees , " " hears , " " feels , " etc. , which involve a reference to one particular sense modality , and such words as " perceives , " which are neutral in this respect . By modal logic , I do not mean only the logic of the terms " necessary " and " possible " but also the logic of all the other terms that can be studied in the same ways as they . Among these terms are most of the words that are usually said to express propositional attitudes , including " knows , " " believes , " " remembers , " " hopes , " " strives , " etc . What is in common to all the modal notions in this extended sense of the term will be partly explained later . ' ' Mere formalization of the logical behavior of perceptual terms as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important or interesting . What makes it promising is the existence of a well-developed semantical theory of modal logic .

First , I want to outline the basic reasons why the logic of perception is susceptible to the same sort of treatment as other modal logics . Secondly , I want to show , by discussing a number of interrelated problems , that by treating perceptual concepts as modal notions we can shed sharp new light on some of the classical issues in the philosophy of perception . These include the evaluation of the so-called argument from illusion , the status of sense data , and the nature of the objects of ( immediate ) perception . If I am right , there are interesting connections between these problems and some of the questions we are led to ask when we study the semantics of modal logic in general . Personally , I came to appreciate for the first time the theoretical interest of some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in effect identical with or at least very closely related to the difficulties logicians and philosophers of logic have recently encountered in trying to understand the interplay between modal notions and the basic logical concepts of identity and existence ( of quantification ) . Problems drawn from the field of perception can even serve to illustrate and to elucidate these general logical and semantical difficulties . Some of the formal similarities between perceptual terms and other modal terms are obvious enough , so obvious in fact that I find it surprising and perplexing that they should have been registered , to the best of my knowledge , only once in the relevant philosophical literature . In her Howison Lecture , " The Intentionality of Perception : A Grammatical Feature , " Miss G. E. M. Anscombe points out a number of similarities between perceptual concepts and concepts she calls intentional . ' Most of these similarities hold between perceptual notions and modal notions in general . An interesting example is the distinction which Miss Anscombe calls the difference between material and intentional objects ( of an activity ) . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the foliage which he takes to be a stag ( intentional object ) . Unknown to him , and most unfortunately , the dark patch was his father ( material object ) , a fact which causes a tragedy . This 3Delivered at the University of California , Berkeley , in 1963 , and published in Analytical Philosophy , ed . R. J. Butler ( 2d. series ; Oxford , 1965 ) , pp. 158-80.  | tragedy brings out the importance of the difference between the intentional object aimed at and the material object aimed at . The same distinction clearly applies to perception . Miss Anscombe connects it with Austin 's contrast between " Today I saw a man shaved in Oxford , " and " Today I saw a man born in Jerusalem , " both uttered in Oxford . The description and perhaps also the formalization of such features of the logic of perception is an interesting and worthwhile enterprise . I do not believe , however , that it can be really successful until we have deeper insights into the way modal notions function and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other modal terms . Modal notions , including propositional attitudes , can be classified according to the degree ( kind ) of success they presuppose . For instance , a knows that p can not be true unless it is the case that p , while , e.g. , a believes that p a hopes that p can both be true even though it is not true that p . The question of the status of perceptual verbs vis-a-vis this distinction is not quite clear , and requires a word of warning . As Gilbert Ryle points out in The Concept of Mind , ' the words " perceive " and " perception " as well as " see , " " hear , " etc. , are normally used " to record observational success . " Most of the discussion in this paper is neutral with respect to this distinction , however . A success presupposition is to be read into my use of perceptual terms only when an explicit statement is made to this effect . ( In fact , I want to suggest that the interest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often overrated . ) Thus it might be more natural to use locutions like " it appears to a that p " rather than " a perceives that p . " This would also serve to bring out more clearly what I want to focus on in this paper : the problems connected with one 's description of one 's immediate perceptual experience ( no matte whether it is veridical , unwittingly misleading , or an acknowledged illusion ) . However , for simplicity , I shall normally employ the shorter locution " perceives that . " 5 4Gilbert Ryle , The Concept of Mind ( London , 1949 ) , pp. 222-23. 5Another natural possibility would be to follow my commentator 's ter-  | Modal logic as turning on the notion of " possible world . " It seems to me that the best way of achieving conceptual clarity in modal logic is to view all the use of modal notions as involving a reference , usually of course only a tacit one , to more than one possible state of affairs or course of events ( in short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this way , most of the conceptual problems that philosophers of logic have run into in this area become manageable . ' There is basically nothing unusual or strange in the relation of our terms to their references in modal contexts , I suggest . What seems to cause problems is merely the fact that in such contexts a term may have a reference in more than one " possible world , " i.e. , that we have to consider our individuals as ( potential ) members of more than one state of affairs or course of events . Modal contexts thus do not exhibit any failure of ref erentiality , but only referential multiplicity . From this point of view , the logic of perception can also be elucidated . This procedure will be made clearer by my subsequent remarks . There are a few possible misunderstandings , however , against which I first must guard myself . First of all , there is nothing mysterious about what I have called " possible worlds . " Following Richard Jeffrey , ' we might call a " complete novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is consistent but which can not be enlarged without making it inconsistent . A possible world is precisely what such a complete novel describes . Actually , many useful purposes are served by descriptions of possible worlds that are less than complete , as long as these partial descriptions are large enough to show that the world they purport to describe is really possible . Such partial descriptions of possible minology and speak of " perceptual belief " and " perceptual knowledge . " The former is then what my " perceives that " locution is in the first place supposed to cover . I am not quite sure , however , that this terminology is free from misleading connotations . 6These problems have been emphasized most persuasively by W. V. Quine ; see the relevant parts of his From a Logical Point of View ( Cambridge , Mass. , 1953 ) Word and Object ( Cambridge , Mass. , 196o ) ; and The Ways of Paradox ( New York , 1966 ) . 7Richard C. Jeffrey , The Logic of Decision ( New York , 1965 ) , pp. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and I have discussed them in some detail elsewhere . ' Second , it is important to make a distinction between two different cases here . Sometimes ( e.g. , in the case of the concepts of possibility and necessity ) what I have called " possible worlds " are normally different possible courses of events . Sometimes ( e.g. , in the case of perceptual concepts ) the relevant " possible worlds " are normally different possible states of affairs at the particular moment of time we are talking about . This distinction does not affect what I shall say is the sequel , however . Third , I am of course not suggesting that the ordinary people who daily use such ordinary words as " sees " or " hears " or " possible " or " necessarily " are ever interested in anything as fancy as " possible worlds " or " possible states of affairs . " Surely what they are interested in is just the unique world of ours that happens to be actualized . The point is , rather , that many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ours can be explicated by a logician in terms of his " possible worlds . " A logician might say that we often succeed in saying something about the actual world only by locating it , as it were , on the map of all the different possible worlds . This is by no means restricted to modal concepts . If I understand a prediction , I know which future courses of events are such that the prediction can be said to have been successful under them , and which courses of events are such that the prediction will have to be said to have failed under them . If I know that the prediction is true , I know that the course which events will actually take ( " the actual world " ) is of the first kind and not of the second . In general , understanding a sentence is being able to divide all possible worlds into two classes : those in which the sentence would be true , and those in which it would be false . For certain technical purposes , the sentence ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the former set of possible worlds . The reason why this gambit succeeds so often should be clear : One understands what a sentence says in so far as one knows what to expect of the world in case the sentence is true . What is peculiar about modal concepts is only the fact that in 8See " Form and Content in Quantification Theory , " Acta Philosophica Fennica , 8 ( 1955 ) , 7-55 , and " Modality and Quantification . "  | order to spell out their logic we have to consider several possible worlds in their relation to each other , and not just one possible world at a time , as we can do in explaining the semantics of ordinary , nonmodal logic . The intuitive reason for this difference is that in order to explain what it means for a nonmodal statement to be true in a possible world it suffices to consider that world only , whereas the truth conditions of a modal statement can not be spelled out without considering possible worlds other than the one in which it is supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be true in the actual world only if p were true in some ( suitable ) possible worlds . In other respects , almost the same things could be said of modal sentences as were said above of nonmodal sentences . I know what someone believes if and only if I can tell those possible worlds which are compatible with everything he believes from those which are incompatible with his beliefs . I know what somebody sees at a given moment of time in so far as I can distinguish between states of affairs ( at that moment of time ) which are compatible with what he sees and states of affairs which are incompatible with his visual perceptions at the time . One can virtually paraphrase all attributions of such " propositional attitudes " as knowledge , belief , wish , hope , perception , etc. to someone in terms of possible worlds compatible with his attitudes at a given moment of time . For instance , we may tentatively put : ( I ) a believes that p = in all possible worlds compatible with what a believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a does not believe that p ( understood in the sense " it is not the case that a believes that p " ) = there is a possible world compatible with what a believes in which not-p would be true ; ( 3 ) a perceives that p = in all possible states of affairs compatible with what a perceives it is the case that p ; ( q ) a does not perceive that p ( understood in the sense " it is not the case that a perceives that p " ) = there is a possible state of affairs compatible with everything a perceives in which not-p is true . If it is objected that these equations are but so many tautologies , my answer would be that they are intended to be just that . Their right-hand sides were intended to be merely paraphrases
