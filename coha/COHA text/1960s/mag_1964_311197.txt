THE LETTERS OF WYNDHAM LEWIS edited by W. K. Rose . 580 pages . New Directions . $8.50 . <P> Some called him a revolutionary , others called him a reactionary , and T. S. Eliot called him the " most fascinating personality of our time . " The time was the 1920s and ' 30s , and the man was Wyndham Lewis . Since then , Lewis has died , and the many battles he fought and which seemed so important at the time have passed into memory . Now Lewis ' collected letters recall those battles-the clang and clatter of cubism , futurism , imagism , vorticism ; the boisterous challenge to the literary establishment of " the Men of 1914 " : Eliot , James Joyce , Ezra Pound and , not least by a long shot , Wyndham Lewis . <P> Unlike most of his contemporaries , the tempestuous Lewis championed the intellect against the senses , ultimately turning on all his friends for deserting rationality . He had a horror of the " surging , ecstatic featureless chaos which is being set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmonious proportions of the European scientific ideal . " His own ideal was ancient Greece . " The dialogues of Plato , " he wrote in Time and Western Man , " have not an effluvia of feminine scent ; nor do they erect pointers on all the pathways of the mind , waving frantically back to the gonadal ecstasies of the commencement of life . There was no softening of the male chastity of thought . " <P> Perhaps because he distrusted the senses so much , Lewis was better at lecturing than creating . He thought that the novelist should write down what he sees , not try to dredge up the mind 's messy thoughts through stream-of-consciousness . His own novels ( Tarr , The Apes of God ) , while wildly funny in places , are all surface and little depth . So many characters resembled recognizable people that Lewis was always being threatened for libel . <P> Verse for the W.C. The many sides of Lewis emerge from his letters : exuberant promoter of the arts , gifted literary infighter , thin-skinned egotist , kindly teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letters are no match for Lewis ' best prose , but perhaps they better reveal the man beneath the controversialist . <P> Like other young writers of his era , Lewis enjoyed bohemian Paris for a few years , but he was hardly rebelling against his parents . He kept his mother , who was back in London , well informed of his escapades . Could his mother find a " nice , peaceful " cottage for a friend who was on the lam after shooting a man in a bar ? Could his mother , please , come to Paris for a couple of weeks to get his mistress out of his hair ? " I 've come to that stage where I positively hate the sight of her , and I think we could amuse ourselves better without her . Still , in any relations but her love relations , she 's amiable enough . "
