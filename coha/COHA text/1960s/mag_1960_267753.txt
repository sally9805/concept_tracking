Orchestra conductors , like the fork-tailed petrel , tend to be migratory in the spring . Among this season 's notable migrations : <P> As a replacement for the late Eduard van Beinum , the Los Angeles Philharmonic announced the appointment of Hungarian-born Georg Solti , 47 , now musical director of the excellent Frankfurt Opera . Solti has guest-conducted most major U.S. orchestras , built a reputation in Europe as a fine interpreter of Mozart and Wagner , next season will make his debut at the Metropolitan Opera conducting a revival of Tannhuser . But his main enthusiasm , he has said , is symphonic conducting , particularly in the U.S. Says he : " This is the country of the future . And it has a growing music tradition .

A onetime student of France 's famed Nadia Boulanger , Conductor Skrowaczewski , 36 , became prominent after the war as a vigorous champion of modern music , in rapid succession directed three of Poland 's top orchestras , also found time to write four symphonies , a ballet , four string quartets and a score of smaller works . When he made his U.S. debut with the Cleveland Orchestra last season , he was generously cheered by audience , musicians and critics , one of whom reported that the guest conductor left him " spellbound , transfixed , electrified .
