Secretary of State Dean Rusk climbed Capitol Hill to appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with a strong plea for the New Frontier 's foreign aid program . Foreign aid is a perennial problem-How much ? In what form ? - to the point that it has become a bit of a bore to many U.S. citizens , although they have always paid the bill . But Rusk last week discovered that the Foreign Relations Committee was in no ho-hum mood . <P> <P> To make his congressional appearance , Rusk had delayed joining President Kennedy in Paris ( and delayed his overseas journey still further after hearing of Dominican Dictator Trujillo 's assassination ) . Aware of discontent because of past waste and ineffectiveness , Rusk first laid a philosophical basis for foreign aid . <P> " Humanity stands , for better or for worse , on the threshold of a new historic epoch , " he said . " We do not wish to make the world over in our own image-and we will not accept that the world be made over in the image of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coercion , we affirm the world of choice . " He placed the problem within a moral context : " It is right to do these things because peoples are in need of help , and we are able to help them to help themselves ; because their children sicken and die while we have the science to save them ; because they are illiterate while we have the means of education . " <P> <P> Item by item , Rusk set forth the Kennedy foreign aid program . It would : Tighten administration by compacting various economic-aid agencies into a single bureau under the State Department . <P> Spend $2,921,000,000 in economic assistance and $1,885,000,000 for military help in the coming fiscal year . <P> Favor those countries willing to adopt social and economic reforms . <P> Allow the President to borrow $7.3 billion from the Treasury in the next five years and use $1.5 billion of the money being repaid the U.S. by countries who got loans under the Marshall Plan . Rusk termed this long-range financing , something President Eisenhower had also sought , " the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool . Even its chairman and longtime foreign aid champion , Arkansas ' J. W. Fulbright , warned that there must be reforms : " We have had too many examples of countries in which our aid programs have been corrupted . " Another staunch aid advocate , Wisconsin 's Republican Alexander Wiley , observed : " This matter of foreign aid will have to be resold to the American people . " Oregon 's Wayne Morse put it more bluntly : " I do n't think the American economy can stand this program . " And Vermont 's Republican George Aiken was downright unkind : " I see no sign that they State Department officials are particularly qualified to handle huge sums of money . In fact , I would say they are pretty thoroughly demoralized down at State right now . "
