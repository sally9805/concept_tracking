" I have , " said the auctioneer , " a man for sale for four hours or a day or a night . " Someone bid $50 . " But this is a man , ' ' pleaded the auctioneer . " You ca n't just bid 50-he weighs more than that . " The bids went to $55 , $250 , $300 . At the sum of $350 Auctioneer Leonard Bernstein brought his gavel down ; thus was Actor Richard Burton , the star of Camelot , acquired by Elsa Maxwell . <P> This genteel exercise in white slavery occurred in the home of Italian Ambassador to the U.N . Egidio Ortona at an auction to raise money for Gian Carlo Menotti 's Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto . Sold off with Burton and several minor works by Chagall and Tiepolo were Composer Menotti himself ( for $501. to Novelist Pati Hill ) and Conductor Thom as Schippers , who brought a mere $325 from Jean Feldman , ex-wife of Agent Charles Feldman . Schippers later registered a complaint with Maxwell : " Traitor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud owners were scheduled to feed their purchases at a champagne dinner in Manhattan , along with 125 paying guests . At $35 a head , the hosts figure on raising another $4,375 . <P> Elsewhere , too , it was the season of peculiar parties and odd balls . Items : <P> The Friars Club of Hollywood gave a testimonial party for Gary Cooper , had everyone from Sam Goldwyn to Dean Martin and California Governor Pat Brown on hand to participate in the big salaam . Those who tried to stick to the subject very nearly drowned him in glue . " A Gary Cooper is rare , there is only one , " recited Poet Audrey Hepburn , " and there will never be another under the sun . " Milton Berle risked a hail of hot lead by saying : " Coop got his first Green Stamps from Polly Adler . " Carl Sandburg announced that he and Sinatra had founded an organization in Cooper 's honor called GADIEP ( Grand Association of the Descendants of Illiterate European Peasants ) . Said Cooper , legs stretching contentedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " If someone were to ask me am I the luckiest man in the world , the answer would be-Yup . " <P> There was never less cause for a wake , but Manhattan 's El Morocco closed down ( it opens again next week , in a new spot two blocks east ) , and the gilded popinjays of two worlds turned up to keen . Surrealist Salvador Dali was there in a vest that could have been made by Youngstown Sheet &; Tube , chatting with Mrs. Hugh ( " Chic Rosie " ) Chisholm . Toots Shor made a ground swell on the dance floor . The usual duchesses were there ( Argyll , Westminster ) , the usual film stars ( Jimmy Stewart , Henry Fonda ) , the usual sporty financiers ( Serge Semenenko , Huntington Hartford ) . The room where Humphrey Bogart once fought a woman over a toy panda was awash with unfiltered nostalgia , as everyone had a last fond sit on the zebra-stripe upholstery . Beaming throughout was John Perona , El Morocco 's owner , and Journal-American Society Columnist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eulogy , quoting Lucius Beebe : " El Morocco and Perona are the products of emergent evolution . Nobody foresaw that through the agency of a constantly diminishing dance floor and a miniature camera all the Wrong People were overnight going to become the Right People . "
