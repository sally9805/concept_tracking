Notes and Comment OUR friend the long-winded lady has now written as follows : " One night recently , in the Longcharnps Restaurant at Madison Avenue and Fifty-ninth Street , I had the satisfaction of seeing a practical-joker type smacked down , and in such a way that he could do absolutely nothing to save his face . That night was rainy  --  a steady , heavy rain . I was having dinner in one of the crescent-shaped booths they have at Longchamps ; it was one that faces the entrance door and the street window on the Madison Avenue side . It was about nine-thirty , and in the light from the street lamps and from the few shopwindows that were still lighted the rain fell brightly , but hardly anybody passed hy . It was too wet for walking that night . There were not many people in the big restaurant , and the long bar was quite deserted , but at a table by the door four people were sitting  --  two men and two women  --  and they were very noisy , laughing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what they wanted to eat . One of the men , the one who talked the loudest and the most , the life of the party , was sitting with his hack to me , but I could see the faces of his three companions . When I had been there only a couple of minutes , the revolving door went around very slowly and a tall elderly lady wearing a transparent raincoat over her regular coat , and a transparent rain hat over her real hat , and transparent galoshes , came in , carrying a very wet umbrella . She opened her raincoat , and from inside it , where they had been keeping dry , she drew out a book and a folded newspaper that looked like the London Mlles . Then , without hesitation , she started to walk toward a table not far from me . But she had taken only a few paces past the table by the door when the man with his back to me turned his chair noisily and shouted ' Hey , lady ! ' after her . The lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and found him laughing senselessly , looking up at her , and his three companions convulsed with am usemem at the sight of her startled face . She turned away from them immediately and again started walking to her table , and this time she reached it and sat down , but she forgot to take off her raincoat , which billowed out awkwardly around her , shining with raindrops . The waiter brought her a menu and then went to attend to someone else . She looked at the menu , and laid it on the table and began to stare in the direction of the street , but her eyes kept wandering over to the four rude strangers by the door , who gave every sign of enjoying themselves and each other and their dinner . She took up the menu again , and then she put it back on the table and took up her hook , her London Times , her handbag , her gloves , and her umbrella , and went out of the restaurant as quietly as she had come in , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her again as she passed his table , but I do not think he saw her go . It had been a pointless little scene , but the point was that there had been a scene . Someone had been humiliated . A woman had been deprived of the quiet dinner she had promised herself , and now she was going to have to decide on another place and on how to get there in the rain , and she would probably decide to just give up and go home . " To divert myself from the spite I was feeling , I began to watch a fat lady in a pearly satin Nefertiti turban who sat a good distance off , several empty tables away from me , in the corner booth by the window . She was square and pink , all flesh , and she sat up verjr straight , with her back pushed firmly against the back of the booth , and her round dark eyes , like an idol 's eyes , seemed to look directly at nothing . She hardly moved her head on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved over the restaurant she seemed to see not one person , or two , but millions , maybe billions , of people , and she ate steadily . A man sat with her , but she never spoke to him . Her fork was in her right hand , and her right hand never rested ; she was eating something creamy chicken a la king , or some-thing like that . Her left hand was laid against the base of her throat , flat against her skin , and the ring she wore sparkled brilliantly , like her earrings . When I first looked at her , she was lifting some food from her plate , and as she carefully raised the fork she glided her left hand down and placed it , palm downward , under the food , and so conducted the fork up to her face , in a gesture that looked as though she might be about to dance in Bali . When the food was safe , when she was eating it , the fork went down onto the plate again , and her left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fork could be filled once more . Her imperturbability and the smoothness and style of her gestures and the independence of her arms and the separate independence of her head made me believe that I was seeing how Siva might cat and still maintain an inhuman ascendancy , because the common work of eating detracted no more from the majesty of this woman in Lnngchamps than falling down a cliff detracts from the majesty of water or passing through clouds detracts from the majesty of the sun . She would remain the same , whatever she did . Nothing would affect her . Nothing could make her vulnerable or cause her shame or discomposure . No one would ever drive her out of the restaurant she had made up her mind to dine in . " I glanced over at the four rude people , and I was glad I did , because just then the Joker fell off his chair . He did not slide off or slip off  --  there was no chance for him to pretend he was acting  --  he fell off , and hit the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , with a small crash . His companions behaved abominably . They did not reach down to help him up , or chortle companionably at him , or anything like that . Instead , the second man in the party turned his back and began to watch the street , and the two women took their mirrors nut of their handbags and gave critical attention to their forelocks . The Joker stayed sitting on the floor for perhaps half a minute , staring at the hem of the tablecloth , and then he got up and set the chair straight and began to blame the chair and said he would sue Longchamps . He shook the chair to show how it wobbled , but it was as solid as a rock , and he sat down on it and stopped talking . Hr drank some coffee . None of the others spoke . They seemed to feel that the fun had gone out of the evening . The second man waved for the check and signed for it , and they all went out into the rain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know how she placed her hands when she was not eating , but her dinner plate must have been bottomless  --  she was still at it . In my turn , I left the restaurant , and started looking for a taxi home , and the only regret I had was that the lad ) with the London Times had not stayed long enough to see her tormentor get his comeuppance . " Saved yi VERY generation of architects and builders is entitled to its innings in the great game of pulling down and building up New York , and we refuse to bemoan the loss of most of the local landmarks that have vanished over the past tan or fifteen years . But in at least one respect the professional mourners for our lost architectural heritage have justice on their side ; on the old buildings that are currently being reduced to rubble hereabouts are to he found all sorts of handsome or amusing specimens of ornament , and the chances are that their like will never be seen again . The late nineteenth century and the early twentieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lions and wiverns and garlands and coats of arms . We do well to observe them now , because the supply is running low . When our new buildings grow old and are knocked down , there will be precious little in the way of ornament to cart off with all that broken glass and twisted aluminum . All this is by way of introducing a hand of intrepid ornamental-object snatchers , a hundred and twenty-five in number , and known as the Anonymous Arts Recovery Society , who are dedicated to prowling about the city and rescuing from wrecking ball and bulldozer whatever architectural decorations strike their fancies . Head of the A.A.R.S. is a jolly , thirtyish Brooklyner named Ivan C. Karp , who in his day has been a Good Humor man , a government researcher , and an art critic for the Village Voice , and who is currently serving as a consultant to the Leo Castelli Gallery , on East Seventy-seventh Street . Mr. Karp got started as an ornamental-object snatcher some eight years ago , while he was photographing people and buildings on the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some people standing in a doorway , Karp noticed the beauty of a stone head carved in the arch of the doorway . Sensibly , he began photographing stone heads , and from seeking stone heads and similar objects on buildings that were still safely standing it was but a step to seeking them on buildings that were being torn down . Soon he was meeting other object lovers knee-deep in likely rubble , and in 1959 five of them got together and formed the A.A.R.S. " To date , we 've rescued about seventy-five tons of ornament , " Mr. Karp told us , in an interview we had with him on a pile of choice debris in the East Eighties . His car , an old . De Soto , with a U-Haul trailer attached , was parked at the curb , and several young and burly A.A.R.S. men were coaxing a large stone has-relief into the trailer with crowbars and block and tackle . " We grab practically anything columns , capitals , signs , moldings , medallions , keystones , " Karp said . " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polychromed , off a building downtown . Our biggest catch was a two-ton Victorian stone head , off a brownstone in the Seventies . Most of the stuff is stored in the cellar and back yard of a member who lives in Brooklyn . We 're incorporated as a nonprofit outfit , and we do n't sell anything . I 'm negotiating to give our most valuable ornaments to the Brooklyn Museum . " All dues paid by members of the A.A.R.S. go for bribes . " Building foremen are an obliging but suspicious lot , " Mr. Karp said . " For anywhere from five to twenty-five dollars , they 'll take the trouble not to smash something we want . We do n't buy what we want , you see ; we buy only the chance to rescue it . Most of the carving in stone that you notice around town was done between about 1875 and 1910 . A lot of it was executed by immigrant artisans , fresh from Italy or wherever , and now and then you can almost feel the sculptor remembering things he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the truly wonderful ornaments are the ones where something has gone wrong  --  where the sculptor 's memory has failed him and he has had to invent something . We 've come on some extraordinary heads on a building down on Henry Street . The heads are all bandaged , and I wonder why . Probably I 'll never know , but you can be sure we saved them . Two of the most beautiful buildings in New York are scheduled fur demolition  --  a triangular apartment house on Park Row , and the Police Headquarters building , on Centre Street . Vandalism ! I wish there were some way for us to save at least the dome of the police building , but it is n't the sort of thing you can bribe a foreman to let you walk away with . Besides , there 'd be too many cops around , " ? OVERHEARD in the fur salon of Neiman-Marcus , in Dallas : " You know , she 's a strange one ; she has n't even got her basic mink yet .

" On the Ball ACHaaacTERN-ric that distinguishes Professor Cyril Northcote Parkinson , the father of Parkinson 's Law , or Laws , from a number of his fellows is that he not only has a firm grip on the realities of administration and taxation but is eager to impart some of his wisdom to the general public . In " Parkinson 's Law and Other Studies in Administration , " published here in 1957 , he pointed out ( with many a telling example ) that . work expands so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thing to he done swells in importance and complexity in a direct ratio with the time to be spent .... The number at the officials and the quantity of the work are not related to each other at I In high finance the time spent on any item of the agenda will be in inverse proportion to the sum involved .... It is now known that a perfection of planned layout is achieved only by institutions on the point of collapse .... Perfection of planning is a symptom of decay . During a period of exciting discovery or progress there is no time to plan the perfect headquarters . The time for that comes later , when all the important work has been done . Perfection , we know , is finality ; and finality is death ... and three years later , in " The Law and the Profits " ? mostly about taxation  --  he showed ( with many a telling example ) that Expenditure rises to meet income . . . . individual expenditure not only rises to meet income but tends to surpass it .... I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of governments ... But ... the government rarely pauses even to consider what its income is It is clear that a direct tax of from 10 to 20 per cent of the taxpayer 's income tends to deflect initiative and ingenuity into a new channel and one quite profitless to the community as a whole . More than that , the brains devoted to tax avoidance have to he matched by the brains devoted to tax collection .... Above 20 per cent each tax increase will produce proportionately less . Above 25 per cent there is serious inflation , reducing the value of the revenue collected . Above 30 per cent the decline in national influence , observable long before to the expert . becomes obvious to the world at large . At 35 per cent there is a visible decline in freedom and stability . At 36 per cent there is disaster , complete and final although not always immediate ....

" I was originally designed to he a painter , but I changed my mind while I was at St. Peter 's School , in York , and at Cambridge my subject was history . After I graduated , in 1932 , I took a doctorate in naval history at the University of London , wrote several books on naval history of the Napoleonic period , and taught at Blundell 's School , in Tiverton , and at the Royal Naval College , in Dartmouth . Following Army service in the Second World War , I taught at the University of Liverpool , and , starting in 1950 , I spent eight years at the University of Malaya , in Singapore , as Raffles Professor of History .

A young executive at Houghton Mifflin wrote to me as Author of Parkinson 's Law , care of the Economist , and his letter , forwarded to me in Malaya , led to my first book , an extension of the articles . The kind of administrative problems with which it deals had begun to engage my interest during the war , when an officers ' - training unit in which I was an instructor was handed over by the Army to the Royal Air Force . I ended up on the General Staff of the War Office . After the war , in a magazine called Time Tide , I published ' The Whitehall Game , or How to Build a Rabbit Hutch , ' a piece about some of the vagaries of bureaucracy . " We asked Dr. Parkinson whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it difficult to say , " he said . " People tell me that Parkinson 's Law is often quoted in administrative circles , including Parliament . It may he that when people throughout the world request an increase in their administrative staffs , they are now increasingly asked why .

I might claim a fraction of the credit , if it is a credit , for that reform , if it is a reform . " The cautious Professor is no stranger to America . He lectured on the history of the British Commonwealth at Harvard in the summer of 1958 , and has since taught at the Universities of Illinois and California .

I visited Ireland last year for the first time ; I 'd thought of the Irish as feckless , but I found them busy with oil refineries and textile mills , and clamoring to listen to me on the subject of business management . They 've declared a ten-year tax holiday on a lot of new industries there , which has encouraged German and Japanese businessmen to come in .
