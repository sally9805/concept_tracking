No nation in Asia has more need for military defenses and more trouble building them than Japan . Face to face with Communist China , it is hamstrung by a U.S. - imposed constitution that is the first in the world to " renounce war as a sovereign right and the threat or use of force as means of settling inter national disputes . " It is also the home land of as vigorous and noisy a group of antimilitarists as exists anywhere in the world . Still , very silently , Japan be gan to build a " national police reserve " in 1950 , which with American aid has grown quietly but quickly into a compact and highly competent organization now known as the Self Defense Forces . <P> Last week 11,400 Japanese soldiers , sailors and airmen went out on maneuvers near Osaka , swarming over the bleak dunes of Gobo beach in a meticulously timed amphibious landing that would have done credit to U.S. marines . <P> Nobody shouted " banzai " and not a single eye blazed with a desire to die for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrating against the maneuvers . <P> Skirmish-Line Flowers . Altogether , Japan 's tight little military machine in cludes an army of 171,500 men in 13 divisions , with 870 tanks , 3,700 artil lery pieces ranging from mortars to 155-mm. howitzers , 110 helicopters , two batteries of high-reaching Hawk antiaircraft missiles and one of obsoles cent Nike-Ajax missiles . The air force , with 39,553 men , flies all-weather inter ceptors and maintains a tight controland-warning system that covers the four major Japanese islands . The navy-once the pride of Japan-has only 55 destroyers and frigates , seven subs and a handful of minesweepers and torpedo boats . But its 34,963 men are still the cream of a seagoing crop , and recently Japan began building its own destroyers - rakish , clipper-bowed vessels armed with American Tartar and Asroc missiles that combine the sleekness of Japanese naval design with the accuracy of U.S. weapons systems . <P> Japan 's military men have played it very cozily indeed . For many years few dared to wear their uniforms off base . Even when they pitch in for disaster-relief duty-as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and floods before that-they are often sneered at and derided . The old samurai tradition of Japanese militarism has been purged-or has at least gone underground . No longer do army recruits sing the old gunka ( war songs ) that praise " cherry blossoms the color of shrimp " and demand that a soldier " die as the flowers of the skirmish line . " A sanitized marching song now proclaims : " Even the smallest tree under the blue sky/Has the freedom to grow . "
