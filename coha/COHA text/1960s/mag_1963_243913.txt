Salaried executives-those French-cuffed " hired hands " of U.S. business-now outnumber self-employed professionals and businessmen on the higher income-tax rungs . The Bureau of the Census last week reported that the families of managers and salaried professionals now account for about half of those in the top 5% of U.S. incomes , while the self-employed account for only a fourth-an almost exact reversal of the situation in 1950 . To be in the top 5% took a $9,000 income then ; now it takes more than $14,385 . <P> This remarkable turnabout in U.S. income patterns is largely the result of the postwar growth of large corporations and their intense competition for talent . Increasingly , highly trained students getting out of college find more of what they want-in terms of interest , challenge and salary-in the corporation , pass up any opportunities to strike out on their own . <P> Though the salaried man is on the rise , a study put out by the Internal Revenue Service ( which has reason to know where a lot of the salaried man 's money goes ) last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranks of the very rich . Of the 398 people who had incomes of more than $1,000,000 in 1961-more people than in any other year since 1929-practically all were either completely self-employed or drew very little of their income from salaries .
