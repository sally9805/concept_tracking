txt Letters to The Times Letters to The Times Staff and facilities are required to pursue research and studies into the many problems uncovered during their attempts to obtain compliance with the Food and Drug Act . The tendency to restrict the Administration 's function to supervisory regulation only has had a deadening effect , leading to continuing loss of scientists burdened with ceeans of paper work . Working conditions and salaries should be made to equal those of other Federal research agencies , such as the National Institutes of Health . Original scientific work and participation in national and international scientific meetings should be encouraged . The Food and Drug Administration , once it had reached a size and standard commensurate with its responsibilities ( and this might require several-fold increase of its facilities ) , should make full use of experts , as already set up in relation to the National Institutes of Health and the National Research Council . Only a powerful and able Food and Drug Administration will command the respect and trust of other branches of the sciences and contribute to the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , M.

State Primary Date Upheld To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Democratic State Chairman William H. 's blast against an " unfair late primary election date for purely partisan reasons to make for as short a campaign as possible and hamper Democratic sic efforts to properly present our party 's candidates and views on state issues " and his recent unsuccessful attempts to overcome this " injustice " by holding an illegal " pre-convention " convention are pure political chicanery . It seems to be a futile attempt to obscure the fact that he and other " bosses " in his party wish to make their own conclusions as to the slate of candidates to run in the fall . There is no need for a long statewide campaign . The reason has been forcefully stated in your editorial of March 15 , in which you point out that a comparatively short campaign did n't save Harriman and wo n't necessarily help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion in six weeks of campaigning . WILLIAM H. HAZEN , Republican County Committeeman , New York County . New York , July 31 , 1962 . U. S. Action in Peru Backed Policy of Withholding Recognition Reported Widely Acclaimed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : With reference to your July 30 editorial " The Chapter Ends in Peru " may I congratulate you for the confirmation of a long-standing tradition of The Times ' fairness in interpreting Latin-American affairs . As a Brazilian  --  and therefore a Latin American  --  I hasten to reassure your readers that President Kennedy has won widespread admiration for the United States in Latin America for his stand during the Peruvian crisis . As you have pointed out , to win a battle is not to win the war . Although the bemedaled celebrities of Peru 's military junta may have obtained , by this time , diplomatic recognition from other countries , including my own , the most decisive victory has been unmistakably scored by the United States . We generally differentiate between intervention and " intervention , " and know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " democrcy " for the sake of *business interests and international pressures . By the same token , there is nothing more effective than truth and honesty , despite everything , and they were on the side of your country this time . It is to be regretted that our Peruvian neighbors are helpless to do anything about their uniformed masters , and it is to be hoped that they will not resort to the more obvious way of violent rebellion , as pressure mounts . But we must welcome the sign of enlightened ca'ange in the administration of our northern neighbor , and wish that the American people will not be misled into thinking that President Kennedy is doing the wrong thing in Latin America . The American elements from the business community in Peru . ( who belong , no doubt , also to the business community in America ) may feel tempted to express their views without restraint , and find these views echoed by a very large segment of the American press . You can be sure , however , that we do not think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we would like Americans to know it . JOSE R. W ' TAKER PENTEADO Jr . Geneva , July 30 , 1962 . Mr. Ferry 's Remarks on F. B. I. To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMEs : One of the Fund for the Republic vice presidents , W. H. Ferry , recently made some criticisms of J. Edgar Hoover and the F. B. I. He made it clear that he spoke as a private citizen , not as a representative of the fund . I have made this point before , in connection with other statements by Mr. Ferry , but I thought it might be worth while to remind the public of this fact at this time . d* The fund  --  and its subsidiary , the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions  --  has many Americans with many different views participating in its work . The honorary chairman of the fund 's board of directors is Paul G. Hoffman , former chairman of the Studebaker Corporation ; the chairman is Elmo Roper , the noted public opinion analyst ; the vice chairman is George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Notre Dame ; the president is Robert M. Hutchins , former chancellor of the University of Chicago . The vice presidents are Mr. Ferry and myself ; the secretarytreasurer is Hallock Hoffman . All of us have views on many subjects and all of us are articulate . But no director or officer of the fund or center can commit the fund or the center to any position on the F. B. I. or any other subject . We have a common devotion to free speech and a conviction that the maintenance of free speech for everybody is vital for the continued existence of our way of life . The motto of the fund is : Feel Free . Mr. Ferry feels very free , and he speaks his mind . This does not mean that I share his views , or that Mr. Ferry 's statements represent any " official position " by the fund or the center , FRANK K. KELLY , Vice President , Fund for the Republic . Santa Barbara , Calif. , Aug. 9 , 1962 . To Strengthen Drug Agency Physician Proposes Reforms for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE IsTsw YORK TIMES : It is appropriate that . the Government and Congress have shown appreciation of Dr. Frances Kelsey and the Food and Drug Administration 's achievement to block the sale of thalidomide in this country . A disaster of the first magnitude has been avoided . This experience is being used to bolster the agency 's facilities and resources by 25 per cent . The Food and Drug Administration is generally known as the Cinderella of the health agencies . It is exposed to such continuous pressures from the people 's representatives , industry and others , is so underpaid , understaffed , overworked and neglected that it is constantly losing its best people to industry and the intellectually more stimulating atmosphere of the universities . It has been given a policeman 's job . But whereas policemen at least have police and law schools and the science of criminology to back them up , the Food and Drug Administration works in isolation in surroundings which are a disgrace in relation to its vital functions . Lack of Space The medical reference library has less material than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insufficient space or personnel to deal with pressing problems ; the bureau of medicine is both physically and emotionally removed from the laboratories . Drugs are judged , but there is no research into the science of evaluating drugs . The work is done by a small band of devoted scientists and retired physicians who cope somehow . Penury is the lot of this key agency . The health services and pharmaceutical industries of the world are watching these developments , recognizing the unique position of the F. D. A. Far from being a bar to properly constituted pharmaceutical business , it guides nation-wide research into channels useful to the health of the people . One can not but doubt whether a 25 per cent increase in its facilities will be more than a token of the Administration 's interest . The sum of - the reforms required to give the Food and Drug Administration the tools to function adequately might be summarized under four headings : The agency should ? be removed from partisan , and lobby pressures of Congress and its entourage .
