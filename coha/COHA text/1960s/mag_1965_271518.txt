" I feel as though I 've just become a piece of public property , " said Jacqueline Kennedy after her husband was elected President of the U.S. Today , 17 months after his death , she still belongs to the people like some uncrowned queen . Now that her period of public mourning is past , she has been gradually trying to resume life as a private person . She has gingerly ventured forth to the theater and an occasional discothque , taken her children skiing and to the circus . But she is still trailed wherever she goes by the watchful eye of the Secret Service , finds herself still subjected to some of the burdens of public life . <P> The Fellow in the Flashbulbs . The burdens are subtly troublesome . There is the escort problem . The charming partner , or the attractive bachelor she might like to dance with , is not likely to be the man on her arm as the limousine arrives at the theater , or wherever . The fellow in the flashbulbs has to be an old knight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harriman - someone of national stature , mature dignity and no aura of romance . <P> There is the official mail- handled by an office on Park Avenue , staffed by eight letter answerers . And there is the fine-mesh social screening to keep out the good-cause riders and the self-promoters , and let through the people who are interesting and amusing and attractive and can be counted on not to take advantage . This screening process is the job of her inner circle , presided over by her younger sister and closest friend , Lee Radziwill . <P> With Lee 's help , the circle has expanded notably during the past few Last week much of it was even to the naked eye , at what Lee Radziwill called " a teeny , tiny dance for than 100 - just a little thing we 're before we go back to London . " <P> Before Lee 's little thing , there were a couple of teeny , tiny dinners . Jacqueline , in a white silk crepe evening dress , had two tables of ten for an entree of stuffed veal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. conductors , Leopold Stokowski . <P> Princess Radziwill arrived in a long , lime-green silk crepe by Yves St. Laurent , edged with gold . Mrs. Kennedy 's guest list had plenty of show business : Conductor Leonard Bernstein , Movie Producer Sam Spiegel and Broadway 's Mike Nichols , Sybil Burton and Arlene Francis , plus Economist J. Kenneth Galbraith and Politicians Robert F. Kennedy , Pierre Salinger and Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr . <P> Masses &; Glasses . The dance in the Radziwills ' duplex , seven blocks south at 969 Fifth Avenue , got under way at about 11 . A five-piece Lester Lanin group made music at one end of the apricot-moir dining room . Kennedy Sisters Patricia ( Mrs. Peter Lawford ) and Jean ( Mrs. Stephen E. Smith ) were on hand , as was Architect Philip C. Johnson , Broadway Writer Adolph Green , and Marisol , the Venezuelan sculptress . Maurice Chevalier and Sammy Davis Jr . dropped in after their shows to do some turns .                @ @ @ @ @
