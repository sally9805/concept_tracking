txt Every morning at Miami International Airport . Pan American World Airways sends a DC7B winging toward Havana . On a typical day , the airliner carries a full crew , five passengers and 85 empty seats . Some three hours later , the plane returns , filled to capacity with Cubans who have abandoned nearly everything they own to flee Fidel Castro 's " new Cuba . " The DC-7B discharges its load of refugees . refuels and then takes off for a second round trip to Havana . This flight of refugees goes on seven days a week , month after month . But lately there has been a highly significant change in the type of person fleeing Cuba . While in the beginning most Cuban refugees were professional men , small businessmen or craftsmen , those coming out now are the very people Mr. Castro proclaimed he made his revolution for : The laborer , the farmer , the fisherman . " In recent months we 've had a very perceptible change in the Cuban refugee . " says 3 . Arthur Lazell , deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're getting the people from the lower economic and social levels , the person with less work skills-the average Cuban . " U.S. officials in Washington and Cuban refugee leaders here agree the exodus of the Cuban common citizen means that disenchantment with the Castro regime has spread throughout all levels of the Cuban populace . It probably also means , they believe , that the government-run . Soviet-oriented economy has deteriorated to the extent that Cubans throughout the island are suffering grave economic hardships . Problems for Castro A canvassing of Cuban exile leaders and their American associates here discloses these other woes for the Castro government : Determination to overthrow Mr. Castro still burns brightly among exile groups and , from all reports , among underground groups in Cuba . Efforts toward unifying the highly fragmented Cuban refugee groups in the U.S. are beginning to show some progress . Signs of corruption within the police state Mr. Castro has fashioned are increasing noticeably . All this does not mean the Castro regime may totter any time soon , observers are quick to state . Against developments which encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among these : - Within Cuba . the Castro regime appears to be effectively terrorizing the population to prevent discontent from turning into open rebellion . Cuban underground forces have suffered severe losses recently at the hands of Mr. Castro 's internal security apparatus . The U.S. Government has shown little inclination ; since the invasion debacle of last April at Cuba 's Bay of Pigs , to give the antiCastro Cubans the massive military ? aid they figure they need to successfully overthrow the ClUban government . A Steady Flow of Refugees At the moment , however , the flight of the average Cuban to Miami strengtheqs the hopes of Castro 's foes that his regime is weakening . In December , 5,428 passengers , all but a handful of them Cuban refugees , arrived in Miami from Havana aboard Pan American . There are now'an estimated 70,000 to 80,000 Cuban refugees in Miami alone , with perhaps 30.000 or more resettled in other U.S. cities . It is not easy for these persons to leave their native island . A slight , bespectacled Havana machinist who recently made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visitor exactly what he had to go through to flee Cuba . A couple of months ago , the machinist 's son , who live ; in Miami . applied to the U.S. State Department for a visa waiver for his father . While waiting for his waiver , the machinist went to the police in Havana to apply for an exit permit . The Cuban police promptly made an inventory of all the machinist 's possessions and got him to agree to " voluntarily contribute " them to the Cuban government . The machinist lost his 1954 Ford sedan , his refrigerator , his furnitureeverything except some clothing . Had the machinist had a bank account , he would have lost that , too . Confiscation is standard procedure in such cases . " Before I actually got my permit. ? " the machinist recalls . " I had to pay the police 50 pesos the equivalent of $50 at the official rate of exchange ) . At that , I was very lucky . I have known of people who paid 100. 2011 or 300 pesos . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit in only three weeks . compared with a typical wait of four to eight weeks , Official Extortion ' Bribing the police to get an exit permit IS not at all unusual , according to Wendell Rolla.son , director of the Inter-American Affairs Commission of Miami , a private organization which helps Cuban refugees . Adds Mr. Rollason : " The extortion is so well organized . it must be official policy . Probably it is a means to bleed all possible money out of those aho are leaving an attempt to get them to dig up the pesos they have Mined asarr.st the nossibility of their returning some day. - A source close to the Cuban underground suggests Cast ro opponents are taking advan.

The police then gave the machinist , along with the exit pet mit. 25 pesos with which to pay his air fat e . This is one way in which the Castro government is raising badly-needed dollars At the present rate of about 5.000 emigrations a month , this system would produce $1.5 million annually The difficulties of leaving Cuba by plane pale in comparison %snit the troubles encountered in fleeing illegally by boat Yet in the List six months , 3,000 to 4,000 Cubans have arrived in Plot ida in small boats , estimates Mi Latell of the Cuban Refugee Center Refugees . mostly fishes men and far mei. , continue to conic to Miami by boat at the rate of 50 to 100 a week , Mr. Lazell Setting out in a small boat across the 90 Mlles of open sea separating Cuba from the Plot Ida keys is ext.

Some Refugees Disappear Mr. Rollason of the Inter-American Affairs Commission sass that " at least 100 refugees we know of left Cuba by boat and have never been heard from since " Examples abound of working class Cubans willing to undergo the zigors of leaving . Jose M. Bosch , president of Bacardi Corp. , reports that six of eight office pi Is who formerly morked in the confiscated Bacardi brewery outside Havana have left Cuba In recent months Large numbers of Cubans of humble origins are showing up daily at the U.S. Government 's Cuban Refugee Center in Miami . which , among other services to refugees , dispenses public assistance  --  a maximum of $60 a month for individuals and $100 a month for families . A visitor to the center who approached a number of refugees at random discovered that the first three all fled their native country in December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat cutter , a 17-year-old girl who had been a clerk in Havana , and a 33-year-old auto mechanic from Metanzas who had had " % my little work " in recent months because " there are n't any auto parts " coming into Cuba The refugees usually begin by stating that they left Cuba because they do n't like communism . Then they go on to talk at length about some of the economic hardships they encountered in Cuba . The shortage of food , formerly imported in great quantities from the U S , is a favorite complaint . A Cuban government stenographer oho came to Miami in mid-December exclaims : " At the legal price of six cents an egg . .1 could get eggs only once a week or once every other week . So , I paid 20 cents an egg on the black market . Chickens we were getting imported from Poland were just plain rotten .

" Besides groceries , other consumer products are in short supply in Cuba . the refugees report Toothpaste , soap and razor blades are mentioned frequently . A mechanic from Ha% ana tells how he sharpened his old razor blades by rubbing them on the inside of a water glass He says he was influenced to leave Cuba by a report that the Castro regime planned to reduce salaries in his industry . " They already had made reductions in other industries . " he adds . Absenteeism is a growing problem in Cuban industry and the Castro government is propagandizing heavily against it . this mechanic says SeNeral refugees say that reporting any faked illness to the government is an added duty that has been given to the " informer " whom the Castro regime has installed in nearly every block of every city Some informers are reported to he willing to accept money to cover up for workers feigning illness Despite instances of corruption , the neighborhood informer has helped hobble the Cuban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has become practically impossible for the Cuban underground to hold a meeting in any city . And within the last two months . Castro 's security forces have torn apart one important Cuban underground group . the Revolutionary Movement of the People IMRP ) . An MRP leader in Miami acknowledges that more than San MRP leaders in Cuba have been arrested since October . Anti-Castro Students Despite such setbacks , the underground in Cuba continues to function . Luis Fernandez Roche , secretary general of a student resistance group known as the Directorio , says that his organuatzon , which takes in high school as well as college students . " grows and grows and grows " He says membership now numbers in the thousands , though he concedes " only a few hundred " members are " activists .

We presented faked papers authorizing us to take Randin to La Cabana for execution . They handed him over to us and we drove off unmolested . " Along with this sort of determination by individual Cubans , the anti-Castro splinter groups in Miami are moving toward closer cooperation .

Mot cover , the Cuban refugees are said to be keenly aware that political thinking in Washington demands more working together by the various Cuban groups if U S. assistance is to be forthcoming . Nearly all the exiles regard U S. help essential if Mr. Castro is to be unseated .
