 | inside " Grand Ole Opry " @# C oUNTRY MUSIC has always expressed those simple truths that sharecroppers , village storekeepers and truck-stop waitresses could understand and cling to . It was born in the early 19205 of a mixture of Gospel airs , folk songs , English ballads and race ( or " soul " ) music , but it soon came to be associated with the Great Depression . We rootless Depression Children identified with the drifting hobo , the spurned lover , a promise of the gold streets of Heaven . Our songs commemorated whiskey widows , sisters menaced by the wicked cities , deep mines and company stores . If country music was our liturgy , then radio 's " Grand Ole Opry " was our mother church . The Opry brought magic and backwater wisdom across the miles from Nashville , Tenn . Its music boiled in our blood the week around : through the hot work of the grain harvest , in the fearful soul-searching of midweek prayer meetings , up and down endless rows as we picked six-cent cot- ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural Texas farmhouse , that music from our old Zenith battery-powered radio reaffirmed our troubles and refurbished our dreams . Grand Ole Opry ? first broadcast on November 28 , 1915 ? is the oldest continuous show in the history of radio . It still claims to attract " the largest single listening audience in the world . " Programmed live for seven and one half hours on Saturdays ( and for two on Friday nights ) over Nashville 's station WSM , it is rebroadcast each week by hundreds of local radio stations . Since 1965 , some 300 television stations have programmed a half hour or more of Opry talent weekly on video-tape . The 50-odd entertainers who make up Grand Ole Opry 's permanent troupe are all stars in their own right . A bid to join the Opry company is the surest sign that one has arrived in the country-Western field . Pay is relatively modest . Still , country artists clamor to appear , for 97  | Opry exposure multiplies personalappearance fees : stars like Porter Wagoner and Marty Robbins can earn $250,000 or more annually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less hardy and far-ranging than the stars they canonize . The typical Opry visitor travels 96o miles round-trip by car ; normally he stays in Nashville for three days , and includes in his itinerary a $3 bus tour of Opry stars ' homes , and a visit to the Country Music Hall of Fame . This typical fan will likely be a blue-collar worker , about 29 years old , and come from Indiana , Illinois or Ohio . Though he will have written for Opry tickets months in advance , he may wait in line for more than an hour . On an average summer night , a capacity 7200 persons from 20 states will witness the two shows , paying $2 for general admission , $3 for reserved . When their favorites step to the microphone , dozens of fans surge forward to blind them with flashbulbs and beg autographs on popcorn boxes and souvenir programs . Recent patrons included the conductor of a symphony orchestra , a half-dozen U.S. Congressmen , and a 2o-year-old Canadian who , after robbing a branch of the Bank of Montreal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed straight for Nashville . The Opry House ? Ryman Auditorium ? is an old , red-brick edifice with balconies and church-like windows and cruel hard-backed pews ( which once served Satan 's purpose in a Gospel tabernacle ) . It is located in a business section of Nashville with much to be modest about : curio shops dealing in sweetheart pillows , lunch counters , garages , a barber college and a series of beer parlors . Nine Cadillacs were lined fin-tobumper in the stage-door alley when I visited Nashville recently . Backstage , only five minutes before air time , there was a fleeting impression of firemen , policemen , stagehands , loose children , and of all the pickersand-singers on earth . Some performers wore suits of psychedelic hues , tricked up with rhinestone patterns in the shape of horseshoes , alligators or ruby-red lips ; most wore outfits only mildly Western , or plain business suits . Then the curtain rose , and a cowboy in a yellow shirt and lavender tie began to saw a fiddle , and the string of almost 90 musical laments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the South , " the site of Vanderbilt University and Andrew Jackson 's " Hermitage " homestead . Today it is also " Music City , U.S.A. , " a great music and recording center second only to New York . Five years ago , local lore had it that music pumped $6o million annually into Nashville ; today the figure is quoted as $ioo million . The city has 265 publishing houses , 15 recording studios accounting for approximately half the nation 's records , four record-pressing plants , more than 700 professional songwriters , about  | 1000 union-affiliated musicians , an estimated 200 " professional artists " ranging from guitarist Chet Atkins ( credited by some with inventing the famous " Nashville Sound " ) down to obscure mountaineer fiddlers and weird jug-band combos . Though Chet Atkins calls himself " just another hunched-over guitar player , " this 44-year-old native of rural Tennessee is probably the most influential music man in Music City . As a top executive for RCA Victor in Nashville , he matches some 50 artists with appropriate material and produces their recording sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with , he has encouraged the loose , happy , natural sound for which Nashville is now famed . " You can get the same sound anywhere , " Atkins says , " if you 've got musicians from this part of the country . They 've got soul . " * Country music has gone international in recent years . Japan has its own Grand Ole Opry . Germany , France , Australia and Ireland are expanding markets , A countrymusic program on England 's BBC attracts 750,000 listeners . CountryWestern is a favored form'of music among GIs in Vietnam , and accounts for perhaps ten percent of our national record sales . On Saturdays , tourist buses depart the Opry House every half-hour . On the day I took the tour , our guide instructed us that the driver would periodically stop to accommodate photographers . The customers paid only perfunctory attention to spiels noting the church attended by Andrew Jackson and the governor 's mansion . They perked up when we reached the wooded clump where Gentleman Jim Reeves died in a plane crash . Webb Pierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guitar-shaped swimming pool " has the strings painted on the bottom " ; his Pontiac " has over three hundred silver dollars embedded in it , zebra upholstery , gun racks and a set of longhorn steer horns mounted in front . " We saw the homes of Skeeter Davis , Faron Young , Jim Ed Brown and Eddy Arnold ? " one of the richest men in the world , though he does n't act like it . " Our longest pause was at the home of Audrey Williams , widow of the legendary Hank . Hank Williams ' big-time career hardly spanned six years ; he died en route to a concert at 29 . No country singer since Jimmie Rodgers , " The Singing Brakeman " ( and also " the father of country music " ) , caused such emotional impact or so quickly became legend . He was one of the first elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame , housed in a handsome glasswalled barn along Record Row . There , tourists study Jimmie Rod- gers ' brakeman uniform , Pee Wee King 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' banjo , Bob Wills ' first fiddle . Those who would get into Opry come to Nashville with songs in their hearts and young men 's visions . The odds favor their leaving within a year . Police and Travelers Aid Society workers know the telltale signs : an old car , out-of-state tags , a stingy wardrobe hanging in back , a stringed instrument . Warm nights , they sleep in their cars ; colder nights , some may seek out 24-hour coin laundries . Unless they are especially blessed , there will come one burning morning when they breakfast on a single glazed doughnut that tastes like crow , and wire home for money . Suddenly the hometown gas pump or the family farm looks good . One night I talked late in a Nashville motel room with Mickey Newbury , a young song writer . Two years ago , Newbury literally was on the street ; today he owns a gold Cadillac convertible , a sharp wardrobe , and an apartment in Nashville . His income for this year may exceed $50,000 . As we talked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped to the balcony . Below , under a street light , slouched a young man in Western blue denims and an outsized hat , a small canvas bag in one hand and a guitar in the other , repeating that mournful howl to the empty streets . " Listen to him , " Newbury said . " He 's trying to communicate ! With just anybody . That was me a couple of years ago . " The lonesome cowhand moved toward the dim lights of a gloomy YMCA building , hesitated , then chose a dark side street to lead him toward some uncertain rendezvous with his personal destiny . " He does n't even know where he 's going , " Newbury said . The unknown young man could not know . Not yet . For the carrousel was spinning before him , playing merry tunes with their promise of golden Cadillacs . He would eventually lunge at it , but until that moment he could not know whether he would be pulled aboard for the fast , sweet ride , or whether the carrousel would spin on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
