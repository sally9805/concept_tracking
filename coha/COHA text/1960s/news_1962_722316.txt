txt Mayor Wagner announced last . night that the city would act to take over the routes of Fifth Avenue Coach Lines and to acquire by condemnation the facilities needed to operate them . This decision , he said , was reached unanimously by the Board of Estimate in a sixhour meeting with the Mayor 's Transit Advisory Committee , the Transit Authority , Theodore W. Kheel , impartial chairman for the transit industry , and city legal representatives . Mr. Wagner scored the present management of Fifth Avenue and its subsidiary , Surface Transit , Inc. , for " arrogant action " in " deliberately precipitating the strike " of 6,500 Transport Workers Union members on Thursday . Little Effect on Public The strike , brought on by the laying off of twenty-nine men , had little effect on the public yesterday . Riders turned to subways , city-owned bus lines and car pools in patterns learned during the four-day strike against the company last month . The union hailed the City Hall decision to take over the routes as " constructive . " But the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and charting a course of action " which is illegal under present laws . " The Mayor said the city 's legal representatives had been " directed to proceed immediately with necessary action to carry out the board 's decision . " But he did not outline the legal steps involved in taking over the ailing private transit operation . Law May Be Needed " I want to point out , " he said , " that the speed with which service can be resumed will depend in great measure upon action taken by the courts and the preparation and passage of any legislation which may be necessary . " A bill , previously introduced in the Legislature at the behest of Mr. Wagner , would permit the city to take over private bus lines for up to five years . Under this bill , however , the lines would get a " reasonable profit " and the city would absorb any loss . Yesterday 's decision was not based on such thinking . It was reached , Mr. Wagner said , on the premise " that it was contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be manipulated in the irresponsible manner demonstrated by Mr. Harry Weinberg . " Mr. Weinberg is the chairman of the board of Fifth Ave- nue under the management that took over two weeks ago after a ten-month battle for control . His decision to eliminate 1,500 jobs eventually and " all unprofitable night and Sunday operation " precipitated the union 's strike . Mr. Weinberg has insisted that the city must let the company raise the present 15-cent fare to 20 cents and restore a 5-cent transfer charge . He has said repeatedly that the company will lose $6,000,000 this year under present conditions . Mr. Wagner , has declined repeatedly to meet with Mr. Weinberg on the company 's demands . He said yesterday that the Board of Estimate was " convinced that it is impossible now or in the future to work out with Mr. Weinberg any arrangement that would provide bus riders with the service t , . ) which they are entitled . " " The board pointed out , " the Mayor continued , " that Mr. Weinberg , in addition to precipitating the strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obviously was engaged in a campaign of rule or ruin . " Mr. Wagner said a resolution on the decision reached yesterday would be introduced when the Board of Estimate met next Thursday . He said the board would meet earlier ' ' if certain legal preparation can be completed . " Public Patience Asked The Mayor said that he could not tell when bus service would be resumed on the stuck lines , but he asked for public patience . He said he was confident the people would prefer the " temporary incovenience " to a series of strikes and crises under Weinberg management . The City Hall announcement was greeted enthusiastically by Matthew Guinan , international secretary-treasurer of the Transport Workers Union , and Daniel Gilmartin , president of Local 100 , the unit involved . They called it " a constructive step toward solving the transit crisis created by the Weinberg raiders . " They also urged that the Mayor meet with them " to Insure that all employes and pensioners are fully protected in the transition . " The union , which has scheduled a mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan Center , sent a telegram to Governor Rockefeller urging that he seize the company 's lines in Westchester . A Surface Transit subsidiary , the Westchester Street Transportation Company , operates in Yonkers and White Plains . It also has been struck . Mayor Is Attacked The bus company said " the Mayor 's statement that Fifth Avenue management deliberately provoked the present bus strike is both false and defamatory . " " All of management 's actions have been in good faith and strictly in accord with the terms of the collective bargaining contracts , " the company said . A statement recalled that the company had sought for more than two weeks to confer with the Mayor , but that it had run into consistent refusals . " Instead , he engages in vilification unworthy of his public office , " the company said . The Mayor 's plan to take over the company 's bus routes " would require state legislation , and thus precisely the same Albany impediment ( exists as is present in the suggestion that the city lease the bus lines . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus operations in this city was a direction to the Transit Authority to prepare a plan for the sale of cityowned bus lines to private ownership " ' as soon as practicable . " Furthermore , the company said , the Mayor 's plan is contrary to " a series of decisions by the New York Court of Appeals , frowning upon the condemnation of public utility property . " What is needed , the company said , Is " good public service by efficient private enterprise at a realistic rate of fare . " Earlier in the day the com- pany and the union exchanged acrimonious telegrams . The company accused the union of canceling the present contract by its strike and thus relieving the company of any obligation to continue pension payments to retired union members . The company said it was willing to negotiate a new pact . A company spokesmen said that it had directed the Bankers Trust Company , where pension funds are on deposit , to stop making payments . He said that such payments to 1,027 pensioners amounted to $100 , - 000 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the company would not " operate one bus on one street in this city until such time as you honor our contract , restore the pension of 1,000 men and women now retired and retract your edict for mass lay-offs . " More Cars on Streets In the first full day of the strike , the absence of buses caused a noticeable increase in automobile traffic , particularly in the Bronx and on highways leading into Westchester . The Transit Authority ran its normal complement of subway trains and buses , but reported a gain in subway riders . A check of subway stations near routes normally used by the struck company showed an increase of 58,800 in the number of fares collected in comparison to a usual Friday morning . In White Plains , a permanent Westchester Emergency Transportation Committee was appointed yesterday by Edwin G. Michaelian , County Executive , to deal with the impact of current and future transit difficulties in the county . The Fifth Avenue subsidiary there transports 200,000 people a day . The committee , it was explained , will work toward providing additonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for special transportation of school children and institutional personnel .
