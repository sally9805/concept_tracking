Of the hundreds of thousands of worshipers and sightseers who have entered the Cathedral of St.-Lazare in Autun , on a hill 150 miles southeast of Paris , probably only a handful have seen or pondered long over the words carved at the foot of a primitive Christ above one of the doors . The words are " Gislebertus Hoc Fecit , " and thanks to this signature , the glories of medieval European art do not , as in almost all instances , have to be written off as the work of devoted but anonymous artisans . <P> In France last week , Gislebertus was enjoying a sudden spurt of fame . Just out was a scholarly book about him ( Gislebertus : Sculpteur d'Autun ; Trianon Press ) , and an exhibition of photographs of his sculpture let the public see clearly details that in the Autun church are set too high or lit too dimly for close inspection . The French were obviously delighted by their new celebrity . Culture Minister Andre Malraux pronounced Gislebertus " a Romanesque Czanne . " <P> The story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a British publisher of art books who lives in France , stopped off to take a look at the Autun cathedral . As he gazed up at the vaulted ceiling , he noticed high in the apse a headless figure who seemed to be a Christ . The unusual pose-knees turned out as if the legs were bowed-and the perforated drapery recalled the Christ bearing Gislebertus ' signature . Was it possible that Gislebertus had done the entire cathedral ? <P> The Master 's Touch . Fawcus found a fellow enthusiast in the cathedral 's choirmaster , Abb Denis Grivot . Fired by Fawcus ' visit , the abb started an investigation with the help of London University 's expert on Romanesque art , George Zarnecki . After twelve years of study , Grivot and Zarnecki wrote the book that Fawcus ' Trianon Press published . <P> The cathedral was begun in 1120 , when Autun was a part of prosperous Burgundy , whose dukes were more powerful than the French King himself . The church was originally intended for lepers and was dedicated to St. Lazarus whose bones are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lazarus full of sores . " In spite of its humble beginnings , it was gradually turned by the genius of one man into a rare treasure house . Except for two capitals by a fellow " master mason of freestone " and some minor pieces done by assistants all of which were destined for dark and obscure places-every column and figure in the cathedral bears the Gislebertus touch . <P> All About Eve . He did not jam his spaces with entangled and interlaced figures as was the habit in those days . He left room in between to permit shadow to play upon the relief . No contemporary had his gift with drapery ; each figure 's clothes mold the body while the spiraling folds and pleats seem in places to hang as if the stone were gossamer , in other places to billow before the wind . According to Expert Zarnecki , the Gislebertus touch was copied by anonymous artists in other churches of the 12th century . But whatever his influence , his work at Autun is the greatest achievement in Romanesque art by a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
