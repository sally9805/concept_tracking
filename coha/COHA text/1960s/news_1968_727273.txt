txt A Federal judge ruled yesterday that Roy M. Cohn , Victor Muscat and Edward Krock had conspired to use Fifth Avenue Coach Lines , Inc. , for their own purposes through a series of self-dealing transactions . Judge Edward C. of the Federal District Court here ordered the appointment of a receiver for the bus company and enjoined the three men from engaging in any further violations of the securities laws . " There is a substantial probability of irreparable injury to Fifth and its stockholders in this respect , " Judge asserted in a 120-page opinion . He found that a fourth defendant , Thomas A. Bolan , had not engaged in self-dealing transactions . The judge 's opinion was the result of a six-week , non-jury trial that took place in April and May after the Securities and Exchange Commission had charged in a civil suit that the four men , all closely associated with Fifth Avenue Coach , had misappropriated more than $4.8-million from the company . Fifth Avenue Coach operated New York City 's bus system until the city acquired the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The company currently operates the Westchester Street Transportation Company , which runs bus lines in Westchester County , and the V.T.P. Metered Transportation Corporation , a limousine service . Mr. Cohn , a partner in the Manhattan law firm of Saxe , Bacon &; Bolan , came into national attention in the early nineteen-fifties as the chief counsel for the late Senator Joseph R. McCarthy 's Senate subcommittee that investigated alleged Communist activities . Mr. Muscat , a well known financier , is chairman of Definace Industries and has interests in more than a dozen other concerns . He is a former chairman and president of Fifth Avenue Coach and lives in Greenwich , Conn . Mr. Krock , who lives in Worcester , Mass. , is a financier who at one time was treasurer , of the bus company . He and ' Mr. Muscat now are no longer , associated . Civil Action Filed Mr. Bolan is president of , Fifth Avenue Coach .

In its civil action , filed lastll October , the S.E.C. charged that the defendants had plotted to appropriate the funds received from the city by entering into a series of selfdealing transactions with the bus company . The S.E.C. requested a re- , ceiver to oversee the operations of the company and to ascertain the company 's true condition . Judge granted that request yesterday , although he ruled that six of the seven allegedly self-dealing transactions in which the defendants engaged did not constitute fraud under the securities laws . The defendants interpreted the judge 's decision yesterday as a victory for themselves . .1 .. 3 " M. Cohn " Personally , I am gratified at the court 's findings concerning me and its reference to the , improvement in the administration of Fifth Avenue since my presidency , " Mr. Bolan said in a statement . " We are also pleased at the rejection by the court of the fraud charges made by the S.E.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added . Decision Is Hailed William R. Grimes , a lawyer representing Mr. Krock , said , " The decision of Judge today clears Mr. Krock of all S.E.C. charges of fraud , except with one small transaction on which Fifth has not suffered any loss . " Mr. Grimes added that Mr. Krock had no desire to participate in any way with anyl of the other defendants or their companies . " He has severed all , connections with them , " he said . In obtaining the appointment of a receiver , the S.E.C. achieved a major goal of its lawsuits There were no charges of criminal activity on the part of any of the defendants , although Mr. Muscat recently was Indicted on charges that he lied abouut certain dealings with Mr. Cohn 's law firm . Another key point in the S.E.C. 's suit was the charge that Fifth Avenue Coach had been operated as an investment company by the defendants , without registering as such with the commission , and that therefore the allegedly self-dealing transactions of the defendants were violations of the Investment Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has been one since June 30 , 1967 , " Judge Victor Muscat ruled . However , the time at which Fifth Avenue Coach became an investment company was crucial , because the act , prevents such a company from doing certain kinds of business with other concerns which it controls on the theory that such dealings might tend to be self-serving and detrimental to stockholders . Judge ruled that Fifth Avenue Coach had violated the act , since it should have registered as an investment company by June 30 of last year . He said the S.E.C. , thus , was entitled to an injunction requiring the company to register and enjoining it from doing business until it does . " There is no doubt that if acts similar to those previously committed are repeated hereafter , they will violate the act , " the Judge said . " They constitute just the sort of self-dealing which the act was designed to prevent . Certain of the defendants have evidenced a marked propensity for such conduct . " Judge asserted that if he had found Fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dec. 31 , 1966 , " they would have found themselves to have violated the act by the transactions subsequent to that date . " Transactions Cited The judge described many of the transactions cited by the S.E.C. in its lawsuit as " flagrant violations of fiduciary duty . " But he added that this was no justification " for straining to bring them within the prohibition of statutes which , sensibly construed , do not apply to them . " The one transaction where Judge found that fraud had been committed dealt with Edward I-Groctc the sale of stock of the Gateway National Bank of Chicago by Fifth Avenue Coach to the Gray Line Corporation , another concern in the web of corporations controlled by the defendants . Judge said this sale probably was made in order to circumvent the Bank Holding , Company Act . He charged that , the sale was not in Fifth Avenue Coach 's best interests , be-I cause Gray Line was merely a corporate shell and was in no position to pay for the stock of the bank . The stock still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted that the affairs of Fifth Avenue Coach had been improved somewhat under the direction of Mr. Bolan and added that he had no wish to take any action " which might be thought unjust to Bolan . . " He asserted , however , that , " The court feels that in fairness to Fifth 's stockholders it simply can not take a chance on Bolan . It is the court 's best judgment that the situation demands the appointment of a wholly disinterested officer of the court to administer Fifth . . . " He said the receiver would be appointed to serve at least until after the concern 's annual meeting . Fifth Avenue Coach is one of a number of corporations under the control of Mr. Muscat and Mr. Cohn . At the top of their corporate pyramid is Defiance Industries , 25 per cent-owned by Mr. Muscat . Defiance in turn owns 30 per cent of the B.S.F. Company , which owns 9 per cent of Fifth Avenue Coach , which owns a portion of its own stock through other concerns that it controls .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
