txt  | carcass . In general , higher grading pork carcasses have less backfat and a higher proportion of lean cuts ? ham , loin , and shoulder . It is important to realize that the carcass , not the wholesale or retail cut , is graded when USDA or most private systems are employed . Though there is some quality variation among locations or cuts within a carcass , consumers are generally aware of the degree of this variation , and there is little evidence that the variation would be greater in some carcasses than in others . It is also apparent that grading of individual cuts , by the USDA or a packer , would be extremely costly . Understand , too , that grading is a subjective task . Though graders are well-trained , experienced , and supervised , the many characteristics which influence quality must be individually and collectively considered and the grader renders a subjective decision . Much research is now directed toward finding carcass traits that are highly correlated with quality and that can be quantitatively and objectively measured . ( See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because fattening of animals is a relatively slow process , length of the feeding period has a large influence on meat quality . Cattle , lambs , poultry , or hogs on a high-concentrate ration lay down more fat between muscles and on the outer surface of the carcass as time on feed progresses . The average thin feeder lamb must usually be fed a fattening ration 70 to 90 days before enough marbling has accumulated in the lean tissue to give desirable juiciness , flavor , and palatability . Four months on a high-grain ration is usually considered minimum for yearling feeder steers to reach the low end of the Table Footnote  | choice grade . This may vary greatly depending on weight , breeding , and feed . While marbling in the lean tissue is desired , accumulation of fat on the outside is not . As feeding progresses , this accumulation can lower considerably the yield of high-priced , lean cuts from the carcass ( Figure 9-2 ) . When high-roughage rations are used for cattle and lambs , fattening does not proceed nearly as fast . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be fed longer . Lean pork is preferred . Because hogs are fed high-energy , concentrated rations and have a natural tendency to fatten early , they must be slaughtered at fairly light weights . Table 9-1 shows how the percentages of fat and lean in pork carcasses change at increasing slaughter weights . Fatter hogs have a higher dressing percentage . In hog slaughter the fat remains on the carcass ; only the hair , blood , viscera , and head are removed . Not only is there a decrease in proportion of lean cuts as hogs get heavier , but the trimmed lean cuts are still fatter and so lower quality , as indicated in the table by percentage of lean in the ham . A true summarization is provided at the bottom of the table , showing the percentage of lean to be only two-thirds as much in the carcasses from the 400-pound hogs as in the carcasses from the 150-pound hogs . Figure  | Since a higher proportion of the heavier carcasses is fat , later gains on hogs obviously require much more energy and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced ! 9.4 Energy Level in the Ration In animal growth the skeleton has first priority on nutrients consumed and absorbed ( after maintenance needs are met ) , lean tissue ranks second , and the animal fattens only if a surplus is available above the needs for the first two and maintenance . Energy level of the ration is therefore a major consideration in producing meat animals for slaughter . A slight restriction of energy intake will decrease fattening , though growth of skeleton and muscle tissue may continue . A further energy restriction will slow growth of muscle tissue but the skeleton may continue to increase in size . One may be familiar with the disproportionately large head and long legs on cattle subjected to semistarvation during prolonged drought . This is because the skeleton has continued to grow almost normally , though growth of muscle and deposition of fat have been interrupted or almost stopped . The classic research of McMeekan2 showed the influence of energy on carcass composition . Pigs fed a liberal ration for 16 weeks , then a limited ration till slaughter time , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restricted ration during the first period , then the liberal ration , produced extremely fat carcasses . Liberal feeding early is apparently important , because the animal is actively growing and can produce considerable lean tissue . Later , after " growth " has slowed and fattening accelerates , restricting energy intake decreases fat deposition most . Because leanness is so important in pork , some hog feeders have reduced energy intake by ( 1 ) hand feeding a restricted amount of ration ? 70 to 90 percent of normal intake , ( 2 ) adding hay or other coarse , poorly digested roughage to a mixed ration that is self-fed , or ( 3 ) feeding on pasture . These techniques are generally impractical as long as the sole object is leaner carcasses . All methods delay marketing , meaning the hogs are maintained more days , more labor is used , risk continues , and the investment continues . Costs of gain may increase more than does carcass value . Hand feeding requires extra labor ( though an automatic system could certainly be devised ) and aggressive pigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasture , more energy is used for movement so less is available for growth . Since leanness can be changed so fast in hogs by selection , it seems practical to follow the most efficient feeding program . If pasture can produce pork more economically than a drylot program , then pasture should be used . But leanness can be most effectively and cheaply controlled by selection . Surplus animal and plant fats have been used in swine and poultry rations Footnote  | because of their extreme energy potency and apparently high digestibility . As would be expected , adding five to 15 percent fat to a swine ration increases fatness of the carcass , but the increase is small and could be offset easily by more rigid selection for leanness . Proportion of energy in lamb finishing rations is influenced by two conflicting factors . Lambs need sufficient roughage to prevent overeating disease , yet must be finished to grade choice at a relatively light weight . Only limited quantities of extra fat can be used effectively in ruminant rations to increase energy content . Table 9-2 shows the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed different proportions of concentrate to roughage , their rations therefore containing different proportions of energy . Carcass grades indicate cattle receiving 75 percent grain graded much higher than those receiving only 50 percent grain . The carcasses carried more marbling in the meat and also more finish on the outside . The extremely high concentrate ration , containing 83 percent grain , produced carcasses of about the same quality as those produced on 75 percent concentrate . Though the 83 percent grain ration was higher in proportion of energy , feed consumption was less , so daily energy intake was no greater ( see Section 7.4 ) . This and other evidence indicate that there is a " point of diminishing returns " as the proportion of concentrate in a ration is increased . Table Table 7-3 indicates the relative energy value of various concentrates . Corn and grain sorghum are comparable . Energy values of oats , barley , and some other concentrates do not seem much lower according to the values given . But remember that about half the energy in a fattening ration is used for maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth ,  | second is muscle growth , and only that remaining is available for deposition of fatty tissue among the muscle fibers and bundles . So the fattening value of such feeds may differ markedly . 9.5 Protein Level A higher protein ration , above the level " adequate " for normal growth , produces leaner carcasses . Lean tissue is composed primarily of protein and water . The increase in leanness resulting from extra protein is not large , but is consistent ( see Table 9-3 ) . Table In hogs the increased cost of a high-protein ration is usually greater than is the increased value of the carcass . Higher protein rations also cause leaner poultry carcasses ( see Table 9-4 ) . Table Similar effects have been observed in cattle and lambs but the influence is not usually so large as in hogs or poultry . Because of the relatively high cost of high-protein feeds , it is usually practical to feed to all species the level of protein that will produce the most economical gains .  | 9.6 Specific Feeds Acorns and raw soybeans are popularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigs have access to them until shortly before slaughter . Acorns contain about 10 percent oil and soybeans about 18 percent . These plant oils are composed of unsaturated fatty acids , so are liquid at room temperature . When a pig consumes acorns or soybeans , the oil is released from the feed by digestion in the small intestine , absorbed into the circulatory system , and carried to the cells for storage with very little chemical change . This deposited " fat " is therefore considerably softer than typical pork fat . If these oily feeds are removed from the ration about 45 days before hogs are slaughtered , the fat seems to " firm up " and good quality carcasses can be produced . This is because the soft fat previously deposited has been mobilized from the original storage cells , metabolized or chemically changed by the pig to typical pork fat , and redeposited . This is a normal process , but the time lapse after feeding the oily feeds is necessary before slaughter . Corn geneticists have developed high-oil strains of corn , specifically for production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a high-energy feed for livestock . Hogs3 fed high-oil corn produce carcasses with slightly softer fat , when measured by precision techniques , but the effect would not be noticeable to the average consumer . Processed garbage fed to hogs sometimes produces relatively soft carcasses , unless the hogs are " hardened " on grain for several weeks before slaughter . Though oil content of garbage varies , salad oils and dressings , lettuce , and some other vegetables contribute considerably . The specific feeds discussed above are of little concern in beef or lamb quality because the feeds are seldom used in ruminant rations , or are used at low enough levels that any effect is not obvious . Also , according to University of Manitoba research , ' a high proportion of the unsaturated fatty acids are apparently hydrogenated ( made saturated ) in the rumen , so the fat deposited tends to be harder . 9.7 Feed Additives Antibiotics included in livestock and poultry rations do not cause a marked change in meat quality . Any change which might be caused by the antibiotic would be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains , etc . When antibiotics were first popularly used in swine feeding a belief that fatter carcasses were produced prevailed . Research indicated that if there was an increase in fatness it was slight and not consistently measurable . Stilbestrol was first used in poultry feeding ( implanted under the skin ) Footnote  | to improve carcass quality . This synthetic estrogen produced broiler carcasses that were fatter and more desirable in appearance to the consumers . When recommended levels of stilbestrol are included in cattle and lamb rations to increase gains and feed efficiency , there is little apparent effect on carcass quality . Because the compound causes a slight relaxation and drooping of the pelvic bones , the " tail head " appears higher on carcasses from cattle fed stilbestrol , and the rump does not appear as wide and muscular . When excess levels of stilbestrol are fed to cattle or lambs , carcasses generally grade lower , have less muscular rounds or legs , have more water retained in the tissues , and have less marbling ( Table 9-5 ) . Ten milligrams per day are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area among cattle that had received 30 mg stilbestrol per day is greater that that which the heavier slaughter weight would cause . Percent protein in the edible portion of the carcass and protein efficiency data help explain earlier metabolism studies that showed increased protein retention among animals fed stilbestrol . Table Some studies5 have also indicated that stilbestrol fed to lambs , even at recommended levels , causes an increase in certain connective tissue components of the muscle . Though connective tissue is thought to be related to tenderness , no effect was noted by panel members who sampled cuts from these carcasses . Cortisone acetate , repeatedly demonstrated to have a lipogenic ( formation of lipids ) effect , may be combined with stilbestrol to achieve more rapid gains and juicier meat . Table 9-6 summarizes research at Oregon State t Ini-Footnote  | versity with lambs that received one 3-mg implant of diethylstilbestrol and/or 100 mg cortisone acetate injected three times weekly . Table Melengestrol acetate ( MGA ) was approved for use in supplements and rations for heifers during the late 1960s . It generally improves feedlot performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding . Other " synthetic hormone " compounds are known to have more marked effects on carcass quality . A combination of 250 mg progesterone and 10 mg estradiol implanted in lambs greatly lowered carcass quality in research at three experiment stations . Pelts were very difficult to remove from these lambs at slaughter , apparently because of increased connective tissue between the pelt and carcass . Some of this tissue remained on the carcasses . The carcasses were less blocky , graded much lower according to USDA standards , and shrank more in the cooler , indicating the tissue probably contained more water at slaughter . A variety of other compounds have been experimentally used in feeding all classes of livestock . When feeders of livestock read and appraise results of such research , they should look closely for adequate information concerning effect on meat quality . Only with such information can the value of the material be fully assessed . Thiouracil and other compounds which inhibit or suppress the activity of the thyroid gland have been tried in several classes of livestock to improve performance and carcass quality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feedlot . Levels that have been used experimentally cause the animal to be sluggish and feed consumption is less . ' Of current interest is the use of antioxidants in swine rations to help stabilize pork fat , preventing rancidity . Pork fat is softer and much more subject to rancidity than beef or lamb fat . Footnote  | 9.8 Pelleted Feeds and Liquid Supplements Cattle and lamb feeders who have switched to pelleted rations to mechanize feeding , insure uniform consumption , and reduce storage space , have noted that animals often go on concentrate feed faster and produce slightly higher quality carcasses . This effect is especially true in lambs where quick finishing at light weights is extremely important ( Table 9-7 ) . Fatter lambs , which grade higher , will have a higher dressing percentage because the fat is part of the carcass , and because they are more symmetrical , the percentage of pelt , shank , etc. , is probably less . Table The level of roughage in cattle or lamb rations influences the value to be gained by pelleting . More benefit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing molasses , urea ( nonprotein nitrogen source ) , minerals , vitamins , and additives are successfully used in many livestock feeding systems . They are easily handled , by pumping , and often make the ration more palatable . 9.9 Pasture The main effect of most pasture is to reduce energy intake and thereby reduce fattening rate of any species . Rate of gain is usually reduced in comparison to drylot feeding of a concentrated ration , but the amount of reduction is influenced by the quality and amount of pasture forage . Some energy is also lost from production because the animals use energy roaming the pasture .  | In commercial broiler or turkey poult units , birds are confined in buildings so pasture is of no consideration . If forage is " washy " ? extremely high in water content ? some animals can not eat enough to obtain sufficient energy for rapid growth and fattening . Supplemental concentrates and/or dry hay must be provided . Legumes are generally lower in energy than grasses , so contribute less to fattening . Legumes do , however , supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixture provides excellent pasture . Such a mixture also often yields more , in addition to providing a more " balanced " diet . Pigs consume relatively little pasture , but if good quality alfalfa or similar pasture is available , this can go far in supplying protein needs . Naturally , pasture-raised pigs will be slightly leaner , but the economy of this type of production , versus feeding in drylot and growing corn or sorghum on the land , must be closely checked . Cattle slaughtered directly from pasture may carry a more yellow-colored fat , especially in early summer when grasses have been lush . This yellow color is caused by yellow pigments ? carotene and others ? in the forage . They are not obvious in growing forage because they are masked by the green chlorophyll . This yellow color does not influence flavor , aroma , nutritional value , or any other quality aspect . Color of fat is not mentioned in USDA grading standards . However , some consumers , and therefore some retailers , object to this yellow color . There are individual and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow pigments to colorless compounds after consumption , so variation exists among carcasses of animals which have all been on pasture . The pigments are " fat-soluble , " so are carried and stored in the fat . A more golden or yellow-tinged milk from some breeds of dairy cattle has the same cause .  | The business of poultry meat production is covered in Chapter 34 , so this chapter emphasizes the sheep , swine , and cattle feeding business . Livestock feeders are in business to make a profit . In normal years they expect a monetary return for the labor , feed , capital , management , and risk they assume . Since livestock feeding , in some cases , is only a part of a general farming operation and hours of labor invested in the particular feeding enterprise are not usually recorded , it is difficult to calculate an hourly return for labor . In specialized feeding operations , however , the exact amount of labor is easily determined . Feeders often jokingly comment that they " ignore labor costs if they expect to make a profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profitable this may be feasible , though not practical . In a specialized feedlot operation such is not feasible ! Labor costs have risen much faster in recent years than have most other farm costs ( Figure 10-1 ) . Years of records from Corn Belt farms have shown that home-grown grains and roughages are consistently sold for a higher price through livestock than if sold direct on a cash market . In some years and with certain livestock feeding programs the return per bushel of corn or per ton of hay is sometimes double , when no return is calculated for labor or management . Of course , this type of calculation would be realistic only if there were no alternative use for labor and management ability . Much money is invested in capital items ? harvested feed , lots , buildings , feed bins , bunks , feeding equipment , etc. ? as well as in the animals . The feeding operation should return the interest on money borrowed to finance the operation , and perhaps some for the risk the feeder has assumed . Even  | Figure if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and receive the same rate of return . Management ability is usually the key to livestock profits . The ability to buy and sell ? the right animals , at the right time , at the right place , and at the best possible price ? is probably the biggest part of management . Selection and formulation of economical , adequate rations is likewise important . So arc sanitation , disease control , proper shelter , and a variety of other  | items . Stresses which might impair performance must be avoided rather than cured . Any livestock feeder must consistently compare his returns for labor , feed , and management with the return he might expect for these items in alternative enterprises . 10.1 Location Though distribution of livestock in various areas of the United States was discussed in Chapter 1 , the economic impact of animal adaptation for the individual feeder was not stressed . In arid climates , feedlots and pens are usually dry . Since disease organisms do not reproduce and spread as rapidly in a dry environment , diseases are less prevalent and less costly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot rot and there are fewer internal parasites which normally would compete with the host for nutrients and cut down feed efficiency . Humid areas are ideal for proliferation of disease organisms and parasites . Though the diseases can be counteracted and controlled , preventive measures ? concrete floors , ventilation , careful cleaning , and disinfectingcost money . Temperature extremes are costly in feeding cattle , lambs , hogs , or poultry . In hot weather , feed consumption goes down , so less of the nutrients consumed go to gain . Prolonged hot spells can be very costly , and air conditioning is expensive , though some cooling can be effected without great cost ( Chapter 12 ) . In very cold weather animals ( especially nonruminants ) use up extra energy just to keep warm . This may sometimes be cheaper than providing artificial heat , but insulated buildings are often a good investment for hogs , poultry , calves , and lambs . Proximity to feed supply is important , especially with ruminants which usually receive a bulky ration and also require more pounds of feed per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species represents an expense , examples could be given where it is practical to haul some of thr ration ingredients many miles so that a broiler , turkey , or swine feediiip operation could be located in a favorable , arid region or where labor is espe cially cheap . Nearness to markets and consumption centers is a consideration , but not so important as formerly . A number of factors have caused meat processors to move closer to producing areas . Speedier transportation and refrigeration allow movement of perishable carcasses or cuts long distances without spoilage . When animals are processed near where they are fed , fewer pounds have to be transported ( carcass or cuts versus the animal ) , and the meat can he packed very compactly in a railroad car or truck . A large number of packers are scattered through the feeding areas of the Midwest . Packing plants ha  | been built adjacent to large commercial cattle feed yards in Colorado , Texas , and other states . 10.2 Financing Capital is needed for four general functions . ( 1 ) Relatively permanent investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other items can be amortized over a period of years because they depreciate slowly . Though the feeder needs a fair interest-rate return on this type of investment , he need not repay the capital the first year . ( 2 ) Feed is the major expense in most feeding operations , especially with broilers , turkeys , and swine . The poult , chick , or pig is small so not costly , and feed is used to increase the initial weight five or more times . For example , for a feeder pig bought at 35 or 40 pounds and fed till slaughter at 210 pounds , feed represents a larger proportion of the total investment in the finished animal than initial cost , facilities , or other items . ( 3 ) Cost of the feeder is a relatively greater expense in cattle and lamb feeding . When feeder calves are purchased at 450 pounds , fed , then sold for slaughter at 950 to 1,000 pounds , half the sale price is often used to repay the loan transacted to purchase the feeders . Cost of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where feeders are bought at 65 to 70 pounds and sold for slaughter at about 100 pounds . Another example would be heavy cattle bought for just a short feed before slaughter . ( 4 ) Operating expenses ? power for grinding , mixing , and feeding , veterinary bills , normal death loss , transportation , and marketing costs ? must be considered . Though they usually represent a small percentage of total investment , they still " add up " and must be paid . Few feeders finance their own operations completely without need for credit . Most depend on local banks and lending agencies for financing . Extension of credit by these lending agencies varies , depending on reputation and experience of the feeder , financial soundness and responsibility , the outlook for a good or poor " feeding season , " and other factors . In a typical cattle-feeding operation involving 50 to 200 head , banks may loan enough money to buy the cattle , providing the feeder has enough feed and capital for operating expenses . Deviations from this example are so numerous and vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1969 , the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first public sale of stock for a cattle-feeding corporation . This illustrates that large feeding operations have need for much capital . Certainly , publicly owned corporations have been in feeding enterprises before , but the 1969 case was the first where cattle feeding was the only , or major , enterprise of the corporation . Feed companies , which furnish complete rations or supplements for home-grown feeds , often extend credit to customers . Hatcheries may sell broilers or turkey poults for feeding and not demand payment until the birds  | are sold . Some companies go further , selling equipment for the feeding operation on a deferred payment plan . Interest must naturally be charged for such extension of credit , whether apparent to the feeder or " hidden " in the stated price . Feeders should expect to pay a higher price in such situations since they have not invested greatly of their own capital and those who have extended the credit are carrying most or all of the risk . These types of credit programs are discussed further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though he may be financially sound and have capital or credit easily available , he spends the money judiciously . He knows where and when to spend money to make money . The purchase of good feeders that will perform well , the choice of a supplement or ration that will do the job economically , and vaccination , when warranted , for shipping fever , cholera , or overeating disease are examples . He also knows where and when he should not spend money . Many examples could be cited , including feeding more supplement than is beneficial , building an expensive brick barn when a pole shed will provide optimum shelter , or buying laborsaving equipment when there is no other use for the labor " saved . " 10.3 Costs of Gains Because feed is a major expense in all feeding operations , factors which influence efficiency of feed utilization may determine profit or loss . Variations in inherited ability to gain efficiently were illustrated in Sections 8.4 and 8.5 . Other important factors are cost of feed preparation ( harvesting , shelling , grinding , mixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feed wastage , and certain environmental stresses such as disease , parasites , or extreme temperatures . Feeding cattle on pasture eliminates the need for harvesting forage . Though the cattle expend some extra energy in grazing , this may be offset by elimination of the harvesting cost . In other cases , however , feeders have found it practical to chop forage daily and haul it to the lot for feeding . This is done not only for fattening cattle , but also for dairy heifers and cows . Though the daily task of chopping requires considerable extra labor , annual forage yields are usually much higher because the cattle have not trampled down the forage . The higher palatability of the freshly chopped forage may justify the daily chopping , versus harvesting the entire crop at one time and storing it in a silo or barn . Cost of feed preparation can vary considerably , depending on volume , power source , planning of operations , and efficiency of equipment . For example , it may not be worthwhile to grind corn for steers on feed if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tractor-powered grinder , and later scooped into the bunk . This would he especially true if there were light hogs following the cattle in the feedlot to salvage some of the corn  | that " came through " undigested . If , however , the corn could flow by gravity into a meter-fed grinder ( requiring no attendant ) and be blown from there to storage adjacent to the feed bunks , grinding might be entirely practical . Research at a number of experiment stations over a 40-year period has repeatedly shown less corn is needed per pound of gain if it is shelled , and usually additional corn is saved by grinding and mixing with other ingredients . Cost of shelling , grinding , and mixing should be considered , however , in relation to the cost of corn . More thorough preparation to insure better utilization is most practical when grain is expensive . Heavier and fatter animals nearly always produce more costly gains ( Table 10-1 ) . Note that the average daily gain of pigs reached a peak at about 175 pounds , then gradually declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that more feed was consumed per pound of gain . There are two main reasons : ( 1 ) The heavier animals need more feed and energy for maintenance ? for movement , drinking , digesting the bigger volume of feed , etc. ( 2 ) Each additional pound of increased weight in the heavier hogs contains more fat . Since fat contains about two and one-quarter times as much energy per pound as protein or carbohydrate , more energy is needed to form tissue in an animal than to form lean , protein tissue . Also , fatty tissue is mostly fat , while lean muscle tissue contains considerable water in addition to protein . Results of several years ' operation of the Ohio swine evaluation station indicate lean hogs gain more efficiently . During one year the 423 pairs of Table 10-1 Gains , Feed Consumption , and Feed Efficiency of Pigs by Twenty-fivepound Increments* Table Footnote  | pigs whose carcasses were lean enough to be classed as " superior " consumed 337 pounds of feed per 100 pounds of gain . Pigs whose carcasses were too fat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the average , but required 350 pounds of feed per 100 pounds of gain . Such a difference has been noted at a number of swine testing stations . During the winter testing seasons the difference in feed efficiency between lean and fat hogs is usually not so large as in the summer season . Apparently the extra fat provides beneficial insulation , so the fat pig expends less energy to keep warm . 10.4 Margin The term " margin " is not synonymous with profit in livestock feeding . Instead , margin is defined as the difference between the purchase price of the feeder per pound or per cwt ( hundred pounds ) and the sale price of the finished animal ready for slaughter . For example , if a 700-pound steer is purchased for $25 per cwt , fed , then sold for slaughter at $27 per cwt , the margin is $2 per cwt . In effect , the feeder raised the value of the pounds he bought . The margin of $2 per cwt applied to the 700 pounds purchased so contributed a total of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation . Any additional profit would come from producing gain at a lower cost per pound than the sale price . In this case , if the steer gained 400 pounds during the feeding period ( being slaughtered at 1,100 pounds ) at a cost of 22 cents per pound of gain , the profit from gain would be $20 . The 400 pounds of gain was sold at five cents higher than the cost of producing it . Total profit for the feeding operation of this one animal ( ignoring marketing , transportation , etc. ) would therefore be $34 , $14 from " margin " and $20 from " gain . " Take a look at a second example . A lamb feeder near Roswell , New Mexico , bought 2,000 feeder lambs averaging 60 pounds for 19 cents per pound . He sold them at 105 pounds , average , after about 80 days on feed , for 20.5 cents per pound . Here the margin was 1.5 cents per pound and applied to the 60 pounds purchased . So the total margin realized on the 2,000 lambs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from profit or contributing to loss in a feeding operation . In fact , when feeding pigs or especially light calves , a negative margin is expected . In these cases the pounds bought , in relation to the pounds sold , is much less . So a positive margin would not be as helpful and a negative margin not as serious . The animals arc fed a relatively long time ? calves are usually fed until their weight is more than doubled , and the feeder pigs ' weight is increased four to five times . All this means that the cost of gain in relation to the selling price is much more important than is the ( ceder price in relation to the selling price .  | Remember , too , that the price of a light feeder per pound must logically be more than the price of a heavy feeder , assuming comparable quality . This is because the total costs of producing the feeder ? raising and maintaining the cow ( or ewe or sow ) , the sire , labor , marketing expense , etc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , hog men often feel a fair price for 35- to 40-pound feeder pigs is double market price of slaughter hogs per pound ( Section 8.20 ) . Even with a negative margin , the entire feeding operation can still be profitable with hogs or light cattle . Because the animals are light , they will be relatively efficient in feed utilization and gains can be cheap . Also , feeder calves can utilize much cheap forage that might otherwise be wasted . After purchase in the fall , calves are often turned out to corn stalk and grain stubble fields until " snow flies , " so their early gains can be especially cheap . A young farmer in Lancaster County , Pennsylvania , bought a load of 500-pound steer calves for $31 per cwt . They were " wintered " on oat stubble and new seeding , then full-fed on corn silage , and were eventually finished on corn . They sold at 900 pounds for $29 per cwt . The negative margin of $2 per cwt on the 500 pounds purchased contributed a $10 " loss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gain cost only 21 cents per pound ( $21 per cwt ) . Profit from gain ? $32 per animal ? minus the Table Footnote  | $10 negative margin per head , figures $22 net profit per head ( again ignoring miscellaneous expenses ) . Table 10-2 shows how cost of gain and selling price influence what a feeder can afford to pay for 600-pound calves he expects to feed to 1,000 pounds . You can compute the " necessary margin , " also , after purchase price of feeders and cost of gain are established . 10.5 Performance Knowledge Most good managers know what it costs to produce their product , whether the product be baseballs , automobiles , washing machines , or wieners . They can show how much each ingredient or piece costs , the amount and quality of labor needed for each manufacturing step , and the percentage rejected at the end of the production line . Because feed is a major cost in livestock production , knowing the pounds used and total cost is worthwhile . Great variations which exist in feed efficiency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by recording feed consumption , and comparing it to gains , can the feeder know whether his animals are efficient or inefficient . A scale is a wise and profitable investment on most livestock farms . The best records are usually the simplest and easiest to keep , because they are more apt to be kept . Feeders can simplify record-keeping systems by knowing the capacity of wagons , bins , and feeders ; by calibrating them in 10-pound or 100-pound increments ; and by trying to handle all feed in batches that are multiples of 100 pounds . This simplifies calculations and helps prevent mistakes . Records disclosing death losses ? date and cause , veterinary expenses , and other items ? are worthwhile . Many feeders routinely weigh feeder livestock when they arrive at the farm and finished cattle , lambs , or hogs before they are loaded to head for market . They soon gain an appreciation of shrink that occurs in transit , the difference in shrink between the feedlot and various destinations , and certain factors which influence shrink . 10.6 Value of Manure A by-product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10-3 shows the approximate pounds of critical soil nutrients contained in average manure , including solid , liquid , and bedding . There is naturally much variation in fertilizing nutrients contained in manure , but the figures do indicate it contains real dollar value . Soil nutrients are present in the manure because digestion and absorption  | Figure excreted via the urine . Figure 10-2 shows the approximate proportions of nitrogen ( N ) , phosphorus ( P ) , and potassium ( K ) that are retained in livestock tissues when 1,000 bushels of corn are fed , versus the proportion excreted in the feces and urine . There is , of course , considerable labor and expense involved in hauling and spreading manure . Also , some elements may be lost if considerable time elapses before the manure is spread on the fields . Soil nutrients can usually be provided more cheaply in the form of commercial fertilizer than by manure . This has encouraged numerous livestock raisers to build " lagoons " or " sludge pits " where manure decomposes under water and the cost of spreading is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be handled as in many sewage disposal plants ? decomposed by bacteria in an airtight tank with the resulting production of methane gas . The gas can be used as fuel , for heating the livestock buildings , or for other functions . The sludge , removed periodically from the decomposition tank , is a concentrated form of fertilizer . It contains essentially all the nitrogen , phosphorus , and potassium , but is tremendously reduced in volume and weight . Organic matter , normally supplied by manure , is important for maintaining good soil structure . This can also be supplied , however , by plowing under large quantities of crop aftermath ? corn stalks , legumes , etc . Manure should not be spread on pastures currently being grazed ; it will reduce forage consumption . 10.7 Specialization Advantages of specialization in almost any agricultural enterprise have become obvious in recent years . Naturally there are disadvantages , but many of these are currently being overshadowed . Some of the reasons for increased specialization are given below . Competition is keen . Though our population has grown rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and not exception-Figure  | ally high market prices . Producers are operating on narrow margins . Each farmer or feeder tries to cut production costs and become more efficient so his enterprises can be profitable at the prices prevailing . There is more technical " know-how " connected with each enterprise . Many alternative management techniques must be considered . Cattle feeders , for example , are concerned with such choices as ( 1 ) handling forage as hay ( loose , chopped , or baled ) or as silage ; ( 2 ) handling corn as grain ( shelled or ear , high-moisture or dry ) or as silage ; ( 3 ) feeding or implanting stilbestrol , including molasses , sulfur , vitamin A , urea , enzymes , tranquilizers , and/or goitrogens in their feeds ; ( 4 ) feeding rations by hand , self-feeding free-choice , mixing , or pelleting ; ( 5 ) length of feeding ; and ( 6 ) selling on a live basis or by carcass grade and/or yield . Hog raisers and lamb feeders are confronted with as wide a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is important to know not only that certain of the above alternatives exist but also when and if an alternative should be followed in a particular livestock operation . Unfortunately not all that is printed or said about new developments is true , and much that is true in certain circumstances will not be true in others . A competent manager must be able to sort out that which he can use profitably . A feeder must combat and control stresses such as temperature extremes , injury , and certain diseases with heat lamps , farrowing crates , sheltered feed bunks , artificially cooled or heated and fully insulated buildings , concrete floors , pressure water systems , steam cleaners , and flame throwers . Farmers and feeders justifiably want to work fewer hours . To keep good hired labor , a shorter workweek has become essential . Expensive laborsaving equipment may be required . This encourages specialization and larger units . There is competition in product quality . Consumers are more discriminating and are willing to pay for high quality items . They will avoid overfat pork , heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and processors who specialize can pay more attention to quality . A hog raiser with 100 sows , small groups farrowing periodically , can afford to pay much more for a good meat-type boar than can a farmer who breeds only 10 sows twice a year . Raisers become better acquainted with the type of animals that can produce high quality carcasses , and can afford to pay more attention to feeding and management influences . 10.8 Contract Growing and Feeding Earlier in this chapter it was pointed out that a livestock grower or feeder should logically expect a monetary return for his labor , feed , capital , management , and the risk he assumes in his operations . If feed is considered to be a part of the capital , it is evident that the same kinds of returns are expected  | If any other party ? feed company , hatchery , packer , or farm manager ? provides one or several of the above essential items , they should expect and receive an equitable monetary return for the items they provide . Contract growing and feeding of livestock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Probably hundreds of different types of contract arrangements exist , but one hypothetical example will be given here . A 25-year-old farmer in eastern Kansas is married and has two children . He rents a good half-section of land that is high in fertility , so he can raise plenty of grain and forage . He has a good line of machinery but owes heavily on it . He wants to raise hogs ( because he has learned feed can usually be sold for more through livestock and because the farming operation will not keep him fully employed during the winter months ) , but his banker has refused to give him a loan to ' buy a herd of gilts , self-feeders , waterers , portable shelters , and protein supplement for a year . The banker feels the risk too great because ( 1 ) the young man has little experience , having grown up on a farm where no livestock was raised ; ( 2 ) he is already in debt with machinery , and ( 3 ) hog raising does n't look especially profitable at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following essential parts of a livestock enterprise : labor , home-raised feed , and a minor share of other capital items ( rented land on which to set the buildings , and probably a wagon and tractor ) . He does not have management ability , or capital for hogs , protein supplement , buildings , and equipment . The situation above is not unusual . Many feed companies , packers , or others enter into numerous operations of this type on a contractual basis to provide management ability , feed , and some of the other needed capital . They naturally expect a profit or return on their " inputs , " as does the farmer . Apparent is the fact that neither party has to enter into a contract agreement until each is satisfied that it is fair to him . As would be expected , the party who contributes least to or risks less in the livestock operation probably makes fewer decisions . This , of course , depends on the terms of the agreement , but usually the party which supplies most of the capital items makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell , etc . Many similar situations might be cited , with turkeys , broilers , laying hens , hogs , cattle , and lambs . Space does not permit detailed discussion of each species or variations which exist , but there are some generalities which should be mentioned . Contract growing and feeding has been practiced where : 1 . Labor is cheap . This is true in some states where there is little industry and people are not necessarily mobile ? preferring to stay in their home ) areas even with low income . 2 . Capital is lacking . Most young farmers lack capital . So do many others  | 3 . The operator wants to avoid risk . This might be a young married farmer who can not afford risk , or perhaps one in semiretirement who does n't want to worry . 4 . Management skill and ability is lacking . Raising livestock is a demanding business . Those new in the field ? and some of the old ones ? need and appreciate help in decision-making and management problems . Those companies who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as : 1 . Help sell feed . Most feed company contracts dictate that their brand of feed be used exclusively for the life of the contract . 2 . Produce a uniform supply of product . Meat packers , poultry processors , and egg distributors want to avoid seasonal peaks and valleys in receipts . They can operate more efficiently at a uniform rate . So contracts involving these groups closely control times of production and marketing . 3 . Produce a uniformly high quality product . This may be accomplished by specifying certain breeding stock , breeding programs , and marketing weights . 4 . Make money on sidelines , such as sale or lease of breeding stock , sale of disinfectants , equipment , and buildings ; or by charging the producer interest rates higher than they have paid for the capital . The items mentioned above are not exclusive to contract operations . Other points might also be added . Vertical integration is not new in business . It has been part of the automobile industry in the United States from almost the beginning . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , food industry as raising and processing canned and frozen fruits , vegetables , and popcorn . It is a noticeable episode in the drama of ever-changing agriculture and industry in a democratic economy . 10.9 The Futures Market Risk in livestock and poultry raising and feeding can be reduced by sharing the risk of price uncertainties with speculators , in the commodities or futures markets . One who is feeding a thousand 700-pound cattle carries considerable risk of price changes . Should cattle prices drop one cent per pound , the feeder would lose $7,000 . Most feeders and raisers aim at a profit on margin and gain . They would prefer not to speculate on general price fluctuations . They may reduce this  | Assume a cattle feeder purchases on the first of October a load of twenty-four 500-pound calves on the assumption that , if slaughter cattle prices , now $30 per cwt , remain unchanged during the six-month feeding period , he can make a satisfactory profit on the load . He expects they will weigh 1,150 pounds each and be ready for slaughter June 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the first of October ( the same day he bought the feeder calves ) , at the market price of $31 per cwt , a June futures contract . The futures contract is a promise to deliver by the last trading day in June 27,600 pounds ( 24 1,150-pound ) choice slaughter steers . ( Purchasers in the commodities market October 1 are likely speculators , who hope and expect that the value of the futures contract will increase between then and June . ) The feeder expects to buy back the contract at the time he sells his cattle , before the contract expires ( the last trading day in June ) . Prices of futures contracts and of the actual commodity ? in this case the slaughter steers ? tend to increase and decrease together . Assume slaughter cattle prices remain at $30 and the price of the June futures contract remains at $31 . On June 1 the feeder sells his cattle for $30 , and " buys back " a futures contract at $31 . He made the expected profit on the cattle ? from margin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the futures contract . He did , though , pay his broker $25 for handling the sale and purchase of the futures contract . Assume , however , that slaughter cattle prices dropped $4 per cwt by June 1 . The feeder would lose $1,104 because of this price drop ( 27,600 pounds expected slaughter weight x $.04 = $1,104 ) . The futures contact , though , would also likely drop about $4 per cwt in value , to $27 . He would " buy back " the futures contract at $27 , " make " $4 per cwt on it ( $1,104 ) , offsetting the price drop on the live cattle . He would have , in effect , guaranteed himself the reasonable profit from gain and margin in the feeding operation , for the cost to his broker of selling and buying a futures contract ? usually about $25 . Use of a futures contract eliminates , of course , the opportunity for greater profit if livestock or poultry prices increase sharply . There is no guarantee that live and futures prices will go up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ futures contract must have on deposit with his broker a portion ? usually 10 to 20 percent ? of the value of the contract . Futures trading is available also in hogs , broilers , and turkeys , as well as in steer carcasses , pork bellies , eggs , and wool . Some feeders also reduce risks in prices of feed supplies by using futures trading . Grain prices , and the prices of grain futures contracts , are usually low at harvest time . A feeder may buy then the grain he has storage space for , and buy futures contracts equivalent to what he will need later in the year . If grain prices increase , his increased costs are oJJset by a profit he can make by selling his futures contract .  | The heritability of prolificness is low . This means that differences among animals in prolificness , including rate of lay by hens , are not caused nearly as much by differences in inheritance of the animals as by differences in environment ? nutrition , presence or absence of disease , management , possible mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of poultry , mating is not necessary to stimulate egg production , but is , of course , necessary in order for the egg to be fertile ? to yield , after incubation , a chick or poult . Fertile eggs may be produced 24 hours after a male bird is placed with hens and high fertility rates may persist for as long as two weeks after the male is removed . Diseases and infections of the reproductive tracts of the male or female which inhibit or prevent reproduction can usually be diagnosed by a competent veterinarian . Some may be treated and cured ; others may be relatively incurable , so the animals are sold for slaughter . Good management by the producer will help prevent mechanical injury . A hog raiser makes sure that gilts or sows near to farrowing do not have to crawl over a high doorsill to get feed , water , or shelter . They and bred ewes are kept separate from cattle during pregnancy . Rough concrete floors around feeders and waterers assure good " footing , " reducing injury by falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and season influence fertility . High body temperatures decrease sperm production , motility , and vigor in roosters , rams , bulls , and boars . These high temperatures may be caused by high environmental  | temperatures in late summer or might result from infection or sickness . In either case , the partial or complete infertility is usually temporary . There is some seasonal effect on ewes . It is commonly believed that most ewes do not " come in heat " or accept the ram readily until the first cool nights of the fall . This is true in many cases , but it has been learned in recent years that fertility of the ram earlier in the summer may be a greater inhibiting factor than fertility or receptivity of the ewe . Again , breed differences exist . Dorset ewes or crossbred ewes with Dorset ancestry are more likely than ewes of other breeds to come in heat and conceive if bred during the late spring and summer . Nutrition is a major influence on prolificness , affecting both the potential sire and dam . Sperm production , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutritional adequacy . Ova production , conception rate , and embryonic survival are also subject to nutritional influences . Hatchability is a factor in poultry reproduction . Health of the offspring at birth or hatching and subsequent livability during the first few days , can be affected by nutrition of the dam . 11.1 Critical Nutrients Energy sources ? carbohydrates and fats ? are sometimes critical , not because they are inadequate but rather because they have been too plentiful and the ewe , heifer , or gilt is too fat . The same thing may be true for bulls , rams , or boars ( see Section 11.2 ) . Certainly energy is needed for sperm and accessory fluid formation in males , and ova production in females . In fact , flushing ( Section 11.3 ) is sometimes practiced , increasing the energy in the diet several weeks before breeding to encourage maximum ovulation and conception rate . Protein is a critical nutrient , because it may be inadequate in some rations . This is especially true in arid range country where breeding stock may receive only dry grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sperm , ova , and the embryonic tissue which results at conception and develops in the uterus are composed primarily of protein . Epithelial cells which line the male and female reproductive tracts are protein in nature . Viscous fluids , containing certain amino acids , carry the sperm ; collectively the fluid and sperm are called semen . These fluids provide temporary nourishment to the sperm , insuring longer life . Fluids in the female reprod active tract also contain amino acids . They help reproduction by lubricating the tract and promoting eventual union of sperm and ova . Hormones which control reproduction in both sexes of farm animals and poultry are composed of amino acids . These hormones regulate initiation of sperm formation , ova production and ovulation , and also help maintain pregnancy .  | Figure Vitamin A is critical because it also plays a role in epithelial health and integrity and because , like protein , it may be scarce if breeding animals receive only mature grasses and hays , or grains low in carotene , the precursor of vitamin A. These epithelial tissues which line the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficiency , become dry and hard , inhibiting fluid production and movement of sperm and ova , and preventing efficient implantation of zygotes . Vitamin E ' has been demonstrated as essential for maintenance of fertility in the male Japanese quail , and for prevention of embryonic mortality in chicken eggs during hatching . Calcium is especially critical in poultry egg production . The shell , largely calcium carbonate , is about one-third of the dry weight of the egg . Phosphorus may be considered a critical nutrient in reproduction because of the soil deficiency in many grazing areas where cow herds and sheep flocks are kept . All nutrients essential for mature animals are needed by developing embryos because the same general functions are being performed . Except in certain areas or situations , other specific nutrients are not considered critical because they are normally adequate in typical rations . 11.2 Growth and Development of Breeding Stock farm animals that are extremely fat tend to be less prolific . Though potential fatness may be inherited , the realization of this potential ? getting the animals Footnote  | much finish may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception occurs , fewer of the embryos may survive during pregnancy . The reasons for decreased fertility are not completely clear . Because extreme fatness may impair reproductive efficiency , many breeders do not exhibit their breeding animals in major livestock shows after they reach breeding age . In the past , competition and judging criteria have encouraged showing beef heifers and ewes , as well as bulls and rams , in a rather fat condition , apparently to prove the animals had , and therefore could transmit to their offspring , the ability to fatten . Actually , breeding stock is selected on farms and ranches early in life while yet growing , so such shows represent a somewhat artificial situation . Oklahoma research ' shows that feeding young heifers relatively lowenergy levels just enough to maintain weight during the first winter as calves ? does not materially reduce skeletal size at breeding time , or subsequent calf crop percentage . Heifers fed at higher levels , in some cases gaining 150 or more pounds during the winter , conceived a bit more readily , but had more difficulty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less milk during lactation , perhaps due to fat deposition in udder secretory tissue during growth ( see also Section 7.6 ) . A 20-year study on dairy heifers at Cornell University has yielded considerable information on long-time reproduction efficiency . Study Table 11-1 carefully , including footnotes . Puberty ( evidence of first heat ) was delayed considerably among heifers fed from birth at the low-energy level ; it was more a function of size than age . All heifers were allowed to mate at 18 months of age although the low-energy group had not reached puberty . The percentage conceiving at first service was higher for those on a low-energy ration , perhaps because they were older when bred . Average number of services for first conception was higher for the low-energy group only because a few heifers required numerous services . Such indicates that optimum level of energy may vary among animals . Similar research at several institutions has shown heifers fed relatively high levels of energy from birth usually require more services per conception . Results indicate more efficient net reproduction among heifers fed front birth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cows were lost because of sterility , number of services per conception was less ( even after removing sterile cows from data ) , and weights of calves were similar . The previous illustration simply indicates that breeding stock being developed need to be fed only for adequate growth , not for fattening . Relatively low levels of energy intake may delay physical and sexual maturity without lowering , and perhaps raising , net reproductive efficiency . Footnote  | Table The " low " level of energy in the Cornell study was described as " 65 percent of standard nutrient allowances " ( as listed in National Research Council publications then in use ) . Since there is much genetic variation among animals , as well as considerable environmental variation ? quality of feed , management , stress conditions ? among farms or ranches where heifers are raised , specific energy levels used in the studies presented should not be interpreted as recommendations for all farms and ranches . This and other research provide bases , however , for developing recommendations for specific herds and environmental situations . A similar effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrated with chickens . Restricting energy intake to at least 20 percent below that which would normally be consumed with a highenergy ration offered ad libitum , by limiting the feed per day , by increasing fiber content of the ration , or by other means , usually delays sexual maturity ( time that the first egg is laid ) . In much research ' where energy restriction during growth was such that sexual maturity was delayed eight days or less , laying house performance was not affected . Delays of 8 to 21 days were associated with improved annual egg production and egg weight ; where matu-Footnote  | rity was delayed over 21 days , egg production was improved in heavy breeds , but not in leghorn-type breeds . The trend toward leaner hogs to provide leaner retail pork cuts has caused selection of leaner breeding stock and prolificness in this species has generally improved . 11.3 Flushing A common practice among sheep raisers is to initiate grain feeding or increase the grain allowance about a pound per day for ewes about two weeks before breeding , to promote ovulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly known as " flushing " and is often , though not always , beneficial . When benefit does occur , it is apparently due to the increased energy consumption . As would be expected , prolificness is more often improved when thin ewes are " flushed " than when ewes in fat condition are fed additional grain . Flushing might also be accomplished by turning the ewes onto an especially lush , growing pasture , where the forage is highly palatable and highly digestible . Because a large percentage of ewes are maintained primarily on grass , most are in a rather thin condition before the breeding season begins . This probably accounts for the popularity and relative effectiveness of this practice An sheep flocks . Also , twinning is common in sheep , if breeding , nutrition , and management are satisfactory . The sharp increase in nutritional state is often the factor , apparently , which determines that twins shall be conceived , developed , and born rather than a single . In cattle , however , twinning is not common . Though breeding heifers receiving a higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season ( Table 11-4 ) , calving percentage generally does not increase . Apparently other factors , besides nutrition , have a greater influence in limiting prolificness in cattle . Flushing has not been popular in swine herds until recent years . With increased selection of lean breeding stock , and sometimes limited feeding of potential breeding animals before they reach breeding age , evidence indicates flushing of gilts and sows may be worthwhile . ' 11.4 Pasture and Conception Rate Three years of research at the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center have demonstrated that certain legumes , such as ladino clover or birdsfoot trefoil , may delay conception in ewes ( Table 11-2 ) arid decrease the percentage that do conceive . Footnote  | Table The lamb crop , as a percentage of total ewes bred , was markedly lowered . Also , because the delay in conception among many of the ewes on legume pasture meant the lambs were born over a long span of time , they lacked uniformity . Many were born too late to reach the choice grade in early summer when prices were highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trefoil did not conceive until after a killing frost had occurred , stopping the growth of the pasture . Perhaps estrogens present in the legumes inhibited ovulation and conception . Research has shown that low levels of stilbestrol ( a synthetic estrogen ) fed to calves , lambs , and gilts has decreased the number and size of developing ova . It is known that lush , growing legumes are high in estrogens and that estrogen content goes down when the plant dies , such as after a killing frost . The above research supports observations of sheep raisers in the central United States that , though ewes gained well on good legume pasture , conception was often irregular and delayed . Research in New Zealand and Australia has shown delayed or inhibited conception among ewes grazing subterranean clover , considered an excellent pasture legume . Influences of legume pasture on conception in cattle and hogs have not been demonstrated . It is reasonable , however , that estrogen activity in such feeds may exert some effect . 11.5 Pregnancy Though a relatively high level of feeding just prior to breeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release of many ova , continued high level feeding after conception may decrease embryonic survival . Nutritive requirements for early fetal development in the sow , ewe , or cow are primarily protein and mineral . During early pregnancy the embryos increase little in size , so energy needs are not high . Tissue produced is primarily skeletal or is composed plainly of protein . During the latter part of  | pregnancy , however , embryos grow considerably and energy requirements increase markedly . Enough energy must also be supplied to allow the prospective mother to prepare for milk production after lambing , calving , or farrowing . Research at the Iowa Experiment Station ( Table 11-3 ) and at other experiment stations has demonstrated the value of restricting feed intake early in pregnancy , using the feed saved for additional energy later in pregnancy . In the above case , all gilts and sows were handled similarly before breeding . All received 12 pounds corn silage per day from breeding to the 110th day of gestation . Concentrate feeding was arranged so that a gilt or sow received the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Greater numbers of pigs farrowed per litter on the low-high system is the result of improved embryonic survival . Pigs in the larger litters were naturally slightly smaller , so the survival rate to four days of age was not quite as good . But an advantage of almost one pig per litter from sows on the low-high group was maintained at four days of age . Table Level of feeding beef cows during pregnancy has received considerable attention . Grass or harvested forage is the major energy source , but is often supplemented with oilmeal ( for protein ) or grain ( for energy ) . This supplemental feeding is relatively expensive . Results of a long-time Oklahoma study which began with weaned heifer calves is presented in Table 11-4 . Because of the relatively moderate climate , animals could graze year-round and were given supplemental feed only  | Figure Table Low-level cows lost more weight during the winter but gained it back during the summer . Nutrient storage during the summer months was appar-  | ently great enough to provide nutrients for fetal development during the winter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heifers on the low level of supplemental feeding evidently consumed more forage during the winter than cows on the medium or high level . In a companion study , where heifers calved first at three years of age , average calf crop percentage was reduced even more on the medium and high levels of winter feeding . 11.6 Nutrition and the Newborn Colostrum , produced and secreted from the mammary gland the first three or four days after calving , foaling , lambing , or farrowing , is valuable . Colostrum is very high in protein , vitamin A , and minerals , and also contaii s large quantities of antibodies which help newborn animals resist disease and infection ( see Sec. 30.4 ) . Newborn animals have little antibody material in their blood at birth , so without the benefits of colostrum they are very subject to disease . Many dairy farmers routinely milk out all colostrum not used by calves , and freeze it for later use should a need arise . It may be valuable for a later calf , should its mother die or develop udder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pigs . Energy requirements for dams in all species of farm animals increase Figure  | markedly at the beginning of lactation ( Tables 6-6 , 7-1 , and 7-2 ) . More energy , and also more protein , minerals , and vitamins are needed for milk production than for development of the embryos in the uterus . Health and livability of newborn animals can be greatly influenced by the feeding of the dam during gestation . Iodine deficiency in the gestation ration of sheep and vitamin A deficiency in the gestation ration of cattle were previously mentioned ( Section 3.1 ) . Animals that are small and weak at birth because of inadequate feeding during gestation have less chance of survival and often grow more slowly . 11.7 Feed Additives and Reproduction Many feed additives such as antibiotics and stilbestrol have caused marked increases in growth . This may mean that certain animals will be heavier when they reach sexual maturity . Gilts , when fed rations containing certain antibiotics , may reach 200 pounds two to three weeks early , though sexual maturity has not been speeded up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that weight at breeding time is not materially influenced by the use of antibiotics . The calves may grow faster early in life , when the antibiotics help resist certain low level infections , but any difference in size is essentially eliminated by breeding time . Much research has shown that antibiotics in sow rations during gestation have little influence on litter size , birth weight , or livability . Very slight improvements have been noted in some cases but the differences have not been considered significant . It is apparent that continuous feeding of antibiotics to successive generations has no long-time effect on reproduction efficiency . Since stilbestrol and other synthetic or natural " sex " hormones have been widely used in livestock feeding , many questions have arisen as to their possible effect on reproduction . Discussion of this topic here is restricted to the normal use of these materials at low levels in feeding programs and does not include possible use to control or treat reproduction cycles and phenomena . When low levels of stilbestrol are included in rations for sexually immature calves , lambs , or gilts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhibited . Ovaries of slaughtered animals fed stilbestrol have carried fewer follicles and those follicles present were much smaller . Therefore , immature females intended for breeding should not be fed stilbestrol-containing rations . Since about 60 percent of the stilbestrol included in cattle rations appears in the feces , immature gilts intended for the breeding herd should not be used to follow stilbestrol-fed cattle in the feedlot . Though these low levels of stilbestrol apparently inhibit ovulation , there is apparently no harmful effect after the animal has already conceived .  | Research at a number of experiment stations has indicated stilbestrol feeding has no detrimental effect on embryonic survival . Massive injections , however , are routinely used to cause abortion of feedlot heifers . Other natural and synthetic hormones used in feeding ? progesterone , estradiol , testosterone , and others ? are known to have noticeable effects on size and structure of certain reproductive organs , but drastic interference with reproduction has not been demonstrated when recommended levels are used . 11.8 Feeds and Toxic Substances Rye is often attacked by a black fungus , ergot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one percent ergot during pregnancy , many of the pigs were so weak that they died soon after birth and the sows showed almost complete lack of udder development . The exact cause of this harmful effect of ergot is not yet known . When moldy corn is fed to gilts , their vulva often appear pink and somewhat swollen , as if they were in heat . The condition is not accompanied by other signs of heat and disappears when the moldy corn is removed from the ration . Other influences of feeding and management on reproduction in farm animals are currently being studied . The fund of knowledge in this area is expanding rapidly . The cost of maintaining breeding herds and flocks provides much incentive for improving efficiency of reproduction .  | Adequate knowledge of nutritional needs or desirable breeding programs are usually not the factors which limit the success of livestock and poultry production enterprises today . We do need to increase our comprehension and mastery of these areas , and producers can make greater application of what is known , but the general area of management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often the bottleneck ( Figure 12-1 ) . We need to know the optimum climate ? temperature , humidity , and air movement ? for most efficient production , and the degree of impairment that results above or below the optimum . Only then can we calculate the relative profitability of providing shade , fully insulated buildings , artificial heat , artificial cooling , fans , ventilators , dehumidifiers , sprinklers , etc . Animals vary in their reactivity to climatic stresses . These variations are economically important especially in areas of the country where climatic cxtremes are typical . Brahman cattle and other members of the Zebu group , for example , are more tolerant of extremely high temperature and humidity than members of the English breeds . Other differences will be discussed in a later section . 12.1 Temperature Extremes in temperature are one of the most economically important stresses In livestock or poultry production . High or low temperatures may inhibit feed consumption , lower gains and feed efficiency or egg production ( Table 12-1 ) , decrease prolificness , increase susceptibility to disease and infection , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower than for lighter hogs , as would be expected , but the heavier hogs are more affected by temperature extremes . There is an approximate optimum temperature range for every animal , depending , of course , upon factors such as size , condition , and ration . The lower end of this temperature range is often referred to as the critical temperature , and may be technically defined as the air temperature below which oxidations in the body must be increased to keep the animal warm . ( 1jj , y , temperature for she of various ages and weights is usually between asi6l.68 ? F. Cet'r which have winter coats and are being fed a maintenance ration have a critical temperature somewhat Li . Beef cattle on full feed or dairy cattle in high production and consuming large volumes of feed  | large quantities of feed is ample to keep the cattle warm at very low environmental temperatures . The upper limit of the optimum temperature range is more difficult to define , and varies greatly among species . Laing hens generally produce most efficiently when temperatures are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at reasonable cost , especially in the summer . Above 60 ? egg production declines gradually , but drops sharply when temperature exceeds 95 ? . For broilers and young replacement pullets higher temperatures are necessary the first few weeks ( Table 12-2 ) . Table Understanding the severity of temperature effects , and also the factors which maximize or minimize these effects , requires review of several simple principles : ( 1 ) Evaporation is a cooling process , regardless of season ; ( 2 ) low humidity speeds evaporation , high humidity inhibits it ; ( 3 ) warm air will hold more water than cold air ; ( 4 ) air movement speeds evaporation ; ( 5 ) heat can be transmitted by radiation , convection , conduction , and other routes ; ( 6 ) heat can be reflected off surfaces somewhat in proportion to the lightness or gloss of the surface . Most of the techniques used to combat temperature influences on livestock and poultry production employ one or more of these principles . Discussion of the climatic stresses is divided into consideration of summer weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Part C includes other aspects of facilities for livestock and poultry . A. SUMMER WEATHER In many sections of the United States the summer months provide more Ievcrcly limiting effects on livestock and poultry performance than do the  | Figure where the average summer temperature is above 75 ? F ( Figure 12-2 ) . A majority of the hogs are now grown in the upper Midwest where winter weather is a major problem and summer heat not so drastic . But shifts in grain production to southern areas ( Section 1.6 ) may mean more hogs will be grown there , and interest in keeping hogs cool will increase . There has been some increase , too , in the number of dairy cattle , sheep , and poultry in the Southeast . Animal productivity is markedly lower in most of the hotter regions of the earth . Though a major reason for the lower production is probably the direct effect of of climates on the animals , there are also other considerations . The high degree of parasitism which occurs in most warm , humid areas may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deceptively lush-looking forage in these areas may be partly responsible . And , the cultural patterns of many tropical areas have not developed a high degree of technical skill in livestock raising . Most farm animals can not dissipate excess body heat as easily and rapidly as humans . Pigs do not perspire much and often have a heavy layer of fat ; sheep have wool which provides insulation ; chickens have feathers . A typical cow , though she " perspires " some , has a maximum evaporative cooling rate equal to about one-eighth that of a human , per unit of surface area . A lactating cow has difficulty dissipating the heat she produces when the temperature is above 75 ? F. '  | Animals apparently have some ability to adapt to hotter weather . Dairy cattle , 2 for example , may reduce hair thickness by shedding , may increase reflectivity by slight changes in coat color and by increasing skin secretions , and may reduce thyroid secretion to slow body metabolism and heat production . 12.2 Shade Shade is the simplest , and a relatively inexpensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pasture or on the range are valuable . Artificial shades can offer the same protection . Did you ever watch cattle lie in the shade ? Especially if the weather is extremely hot , they pick shade on top of a hill where a breeze blows . They lie on the north side and away from the tree , so radiant heat they emit will not reflect back from the lower branches . Properly designed shades will reduce radiation heat on cattle , hogs , and sheep up to 50 percent . Research indicates shades should be 10 to 12 feet high . If possible they should be on top of a hill and be open on all sides . If the long dimension of the shade is east-west more radiation is prevented , but if the long dimension is north-south sun may cover the entire area part of each day , improving sanitation . If the roof slopes it should be high on the north side . A four- to six-inch layer of hay provided the coolest shade in California tests where galvanized iron , aluminum , and boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12-3 ) . Hay , held in place by wire above and below , has an insulating effect . Heat from the sun does not penetrate through to radiate onto the cattle , and little radiant heat from the cattle reflects back from the underside of the shade . Also , hot air under the shade can rise up through the loose hay . If metal or wood shade roofs are used , the top should be white or shiny to reflect all heat possible , and the underside should be dull and dark to avoid reflecting animal heat it receives . Shade roofs should be solid , without space between boards , for maximum benefit . Sixty square feet of shade per animal is apparently adequate for cattle . I logs and sheep need 20 to 30 square feet each . Essentially all poultry are raised year-round in closed buildings , so external shade is of no concern . 12.3 Air Movement Air movement promotes evaporation , making cooling by perspiration more clkctive , and it helps remove heat dissipated by animals in the form of Footnote  | Figure radiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moisture , in the form of water vapor . It also helps cool parts of the surroundings ? barn walls and roofs , fences , earth , bunks , etc. ? which , in turn , helps keep the animals cooler . Because birds produce much heat per unit of weight ( Table 12-3 ) , because they are generally confined , and because refrigeration cooling is uneconomical , ventilation systems for poultry units have been thoroughly developed to achieve economical help in maintaining desired temperature and humidity . Removal of ammonia , other odors , and dust is another vital function of ventilation . A 4.5-pound hen will produce about 40 BTU per hour and about 0.6 pounds water per day during the summer . When one considers henhouses Table  | holding 10,000 to 20,000 birds , the volume of water and the quantity of heat to be removed is almost awesome . A system that will exchange 3 cubic feet of air per minute per bird for broiler units or 7 cubic feet per minute for 4-to 5-pound hens is required during the summer . Because a large portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the droppings reduces the water removal load on the ventilating system . When outside temperatures exceed 90 ? for long periods and in areas where humidity is high , however , using maximum ventilation capacity without some form of cooling may be harmful because it may increase house temperature and bird discomfort . A typical ventilation system is shown in Figure 12-4 . Air intake routes can be changed for winter and summer . Fans are reversible and may be regulated by time clocks , by temperature , or even by humidity . Temperature Figure  | Table is generally the regulator and determines the number of fans that operate and their speed . Where heat is a problem with stock in pens , it is worthwhile to use wire or cable fences , which offer less resistance to air movement . Orientation of feedlots and corrals to take advantage of natural air movement is important . Large fans for cattle confined to pens with wooden fences or to stanchion barns may be profitable ( Table 12-4 ) . Note that the benefit from the fan , in terms of feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater in the first year when the mean temperature and relative humidity were both higher . During the first year test , average air velocity in the control pen was 0.63 MPH , in the fanequipped pen it was 3.7 MPH . Missouri tests have demonstrated that winds of five to ten miles per hour , provided by fans , will help maintain milk production in dairy cows when temperature exceeds 80 ? . 12.4 Cooling with Water Sprinklers , sanitary wallows , and commercial or homemade evaporative water coolers have paid big dividends in some livestock enterprises , especially swine . Water pumped from deep underground is already cool , so the main cost is pumping . Evaporative coolers can operate cheaply , where natural wind provides the evaporation . In Texas experiments3 a concrete hog wallow , or fogging or sprinkler system , has consistently increased gains ten percent , when the average temperature is 85 ? F. or above . Footnote  | In Georgia research , ' a fine spray from the nozzle of a garden hose permitted increased pig gains of 6 to 24 percent in summers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? respectively , and the average minimum temperatures were 67 ? to 72 ? respectively . Studies in the northern part of the United States have also demonstrated that swine show the effects of heat when temperatures reach 80 ? F. The rate of breathing increases and , at 90 ? F or above , respiration rate may increase to 150 to 200 per minute and body temperature goes up . These effects are probably more severe in the eastern Corn Belt where humidity is higher . Research at Purdue has demonstrated the value of a wallow or spray in addition to shade ( Table 12-5 ) . Table Though the pigs having access to a wallow the first year made almost as rapid gains as those having the spray , those with the wallow made the poorest gains the second year . That year all pigs were affected by influenza and those in the wallow were affected most severely . This illustrated the sanitation and disease control problem inherent with a wallow . The size of fall litters was greatly increased in Oklahoma5 research by cooling gilts and sows during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under an open shade . Sows that had only shade farrowed an average of 7.71 pigs per litter , while those protected from heat by the shade and water mist farrowed 10.06 pigs per litter . Water cooling is naturally more effective in arid climates where evaporation is quicker . In humid areas , sprinklers can actually increase humidity and lower evaporation . With cattle in humid areas , a fine spray that wets only the outer hair coats serves as an insulator , preventing heat dissipation . Footnote  | In such cases , water cooling can be effective only if cold water is used and if the animals are soaked to the skin . Wetting the outer wool of sheep would also be a hindrance . Water-cooling in poultry units would contribute to the moisture problem so is seldom used . Water may be most effectively used to cool beef or dairy cattle by spraying a mist on hay or burlap shade , erected to the windward side of the feedlot or loafing area . Such a system works well for hogs , especially where there is no concrete floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprays are used they are most efficient if the mist is so fine that it almost evaporates before it reaches the floor or ground . When dairy cows in Louisiana6 were sprinkled with water during the summer months when maximum daily temperature averaged about 90 ? F , milk production increased slightly among Holsteins but there was practically no increase among Jerseys . All cows were given shade . Commercially constructed evaporative coolers , designed for homes or offices , can also be used . Since these are relatively compact and enclosed , a powered fan is needed to force air movement needed to give substantial evaporation and cooling . Remember that evaporation of moisture from grass likewise gives a cooling effect . To illustrate , stand at the leeward end of a dry , plowed field on a hot summer day , then move to the leeward end of a clover or alfalfa field . Breeze blowing off the forage will be considerably cooler than from the plowed field . So why not put your brood sows under some shade on a slight knoll just north of the clover field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooling Cooling with water is less effective in humid areas and where there is less air movement . It offers some sanitation problems , and water supply is sometimes critical . Also because humidity and air movement fluctuate , it is hard to maintain a relatively uniform cooled atmosphere and refrigerated cooling is sometimes necessary . An increasing number of swine raisers have insulated buildings for year-round farrowing and confinement rearing , including forced ventilation and a complete duct system for heating . The next step , toward refrigerated air conditioning , seems practical in some cases . The main cost is the refrigerator unit . Complete insulation of the building makes the cooling effective and efficient . With lowered humidity , temperature does not need to be lowered so far . Profitability naturally depends on cost versus increased productivity and feed-saving ( Figure 12-5 ) . Profitability of refrigerated cooling for cattle or poultry is less likely . Footnote  | Value of keeping rams in cooled chambers during a summer breeding season is discussed in Section 13.2. 12.6 Water Supply and Temperature Ample water has long been proved essential for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eight times as much water as they will consume feed ; in hot weather they need more . Laying hens will consume about 2 times as much water as feed at 50 degrees and up to 5 times as much at 90 to 100 degrees . Cattle on the range ' tend to do most of their drinking in the forenoon and the late afternoon and evening , as long as air temperature is below 80 ? F. As temperature increases , cattle drink oftener , and at 90 ? F they tend to drink at least every two hours . This means that wells on the ranches of the hot Southwest need to be fairly close . There is naturally a practical limit , but many ranchers arrange wells so a cow is never over a mile from water even though grazing areas are vast . South Dakota research has shown that over 300 feet between feed and water will reduce pig gains in drylot . This may be important with lambs and cattle on feed , though probably less so because of the volume of water " stored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water for feedlot cattle may increase animal comfort and performance . In four southern California tests daily gains were 0.19 to 0.50 pounds higher when water was 65 ? F rather than 90 ? F. Mechanical cooling of water may often be uneconomical , but several other techniques will help . Water from wells is colder than from ponds or creeks . Shade over a tank will keep water two to three degrees cooler . A shallow tank means fresher water ( and cooler if from a well ) and water in such a tank stays cooler because of surface evaporation . 12.7 Ration The proper ration for hot weather is extremely important in livestock and poultry production . Regardless of species , high fiber diets should be avoided . Such feeds produce a high " heat increment , " which means a larg amount of extra body heat develops in the process of digesting and utilizing such feeds . This extra heat must be dissipated , a difficult task in hot weather . In general , summer rations should contain considerable concentrates and any roughage used should be top quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top " feed to help maintain feed consumption in extremely hot weather . This is especially important where lowered consumption may cause a prolonged production slump . The top feed usually contains extremely high levels of trace minerals and B vitamins . Certain B vitamins actually stimulate appetite . This high potency feed may be sprinkled on top of the regular ration periodically in hot weather or fed in limited quantities after the feeders have been empty for an hour or so . Such a practice might have value in swine feeding . B. WINTER WEATHER The effects of winter weather have long been noted by livestock and poultry producers because of the effect the weather has on the human . In fact , it might be that some farm buildings have been designed to protect the farmer more than to protect the animals . Swine and poultry require good shelter from cold temperatures of the winter , in order to produce at high level efficiently . ( See Table 12-1 . ) Cattle and sheep , however , are markedly different and have less need for shelter , especially when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore are naturally adapted to cold temperatures . Cattle are much larger animals , therefore have less surface area per unit weight . This means less body heat , in relation to that produced , is lost . And-since both these species are ruminants , they eat roughages which have a high heat increvnenl , producing more heat inside their bodies relative to size .  | Figure 12.8 Minimum Shelter Minimum shelter needs are much higher for young animals in winter months . Because they are smaller and less symmetrical , they have more surface area per unit weight , and relatively more heat is lost by evaporation , radiation , convection , and other routes . Anything which might increase this loss , such as wet bedding or drafts , is especially harmful . The temperature-regulating mechanism is also apparently not fully developed in young animals . This includes ability to increase metabolism to provide more body heat , to constrict surface capillaries to prevent heat loss , etc . This is especially critical with baby chicks , poults , and pigs because of their small size . Mature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high feed intake where considerable heat is producd as a natural by-product of digestion and metabolism . Ewe flocks on the open ranges of Wyoming and Montana seldom need more shelter than the leeward side of a hill , unless blizzards are especially wet and prolonged . The same is true for cow herds or yearling stocker cattle . Yearlings and two-year-old cattle on feed in the northern Midwest , if kept dry , usually need only a windbreak or open shed . 12.9 Providing Heat The economy of providing artificial heat for cattle or lambs on feed or for breeding herds and flocks has not been generally demonstrated . Though  | extra heat for weaned pigs on feed may be worthwhile , the greatest value of artificial heat is at lambing and farrowing time and for several days or weeks thereafter . Extra heat for newborn calves is seldom needed if housing is adequate . A number of heating systems are used , some of which are mentioned here . Heat lamps are popular for newborn pigs and lambs . They not only provide direct heat , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If properly placed in farrowing pens or stalls , they help attract pigs away from where the sow might lie on them . Most brooders are simply a combination of a heat lamp and a hover which helps hold the heat down near the floor where it does the most good . A thermostatically controlled heat pad , on which pigs or Iambs might lie to keep warm , is also used . Many swine housing units are now constructed with heating facilities imbedded in the floor . These might be electric cables or pipes for steam or hot water ( the pipe system can also be used for air conditioning ) . Where farrowing stalls are permanent , such floor heating might be located where the baby pigs should eat , drink , and lie , to the side of where the sow lies . In growing houses , for weaned pigs , floor heating is usually concentrated on the higher floor section , away from the alleyway . Feeders and waterers are usually placed adjacent to the alleyway and pigs are encouraged to nest on the higher floor level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young pigs , keeping the heat near the floor and helping to prevent drafts in large buildings . Hot air heat , from central furnaces , space heaters , and other heating equipment , can be adapted to certain livestock operations . Merits of each depend on such factors as the job to be done , the building , equipment , cost of installation , and power cost . Some swine and poultry houses are built to take advantage of solar heat . Numerous thermopane windows on the south side allow much radiant heat from the sun to enter ( Figure 12-7 ) . This can be very effective and practical Figure  | if the building is well insulated , though such windows are expensive . Roof overhang is calculated so the sun does n't shine in the windows during the hotter months , but does provide needed warmth during seasons when the sun is lower and more heat is needed . Roof overhang can also be adjustable . 12.10 Heating Water Heating water , above the temperature needed to keep it from freezing , has not proved worthwhile in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water at 10 or 20 degrees above freezing temperature , in various experiments , has not consistently improved feed consumption , gains , or feed efficiency . Water is most easily and cheaply kept from freezing if waterers are inside or well sheltered , a small amount of water is exposed to the cold , and the water is kept fresh and moving . A system has been devised and used in which water is pumped continually through waterers and back into an underground pipe and a reservoir . Unless temperatures are extremely cold and waterers are not protected , the earth keeps the circulating water warm enough to prevent freezing . 12.11 Ventilation Air movement , primarily to hold down humidity , is essential for confined livestock and poultry regardless of temperature . The quantity of air that needs to be moved naturally depends on number and weight of animals confined , temperature inside and outside , and humidity of the outside air . Ventilation should be designed according to the maximum needs anticipated . Ventilation is especially effective in removing moisture during winter because of the principle that water-holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in temperature . Outside air at 30 ? F and 90 percent relative humidity contains 0.25 pounds water per 1,000 cu ft . When warmed to 50 ? F it will hold 0.54 pounds ; at 70 ? F it will hold 1.04 pounds . Theoretically , then , a ventilating system in a broiler house could remove 790 pounds ( almost 100 gallons ) of water by pulling in a million cubic feet of air ( 30 ? F , 90 percent relative humidity ) , letting it warm as the result of bird heat , and returning it to the outside . Poultry produce so much heat that such a system can be completely effective in laying houses without supplemental heat ( Figure 12-8 ) . Brooder heat is required , of course , for smaller birds ? broilers , poults , and growing pullets . Preventing a buildup of ammonia in poultry units is another objective of the ventilating system . Ammonia forms quickly because of the high  | Figure nitrogen and moisture content of poultry droppings . It causes watery eyes due to irritation and , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases . Frequent removal of droppings will help hold down ammonia levels . Ventilation is very important in shelter for cattle and lambs on feed since humidity builds up quickly in closed sheds or barns . Then moisture condenses on walls , the bedding gets wet , and the cattle or lambs develop colds or other respiratory trouble . If confined to such shelter , their hair or wool may get damp and they chill when they go out to eat in a cold wind . Calves naturally need more shelter than older cattle , but even here a shed closed on three sides is ample and ventilation must be adequate . Ventilation needs can be held down by using less water in cleaning , providing steep floor slopes and floor drains so much urine and water escapes as liquid , using minimum bedding and , in the case of poultry where droppings contain much water , frequent removal of droppings . Because ventilation is so critical , some old ramshackle buildings are actually better for cattle , sheep , and hogs because they are well ventilated . Unless animals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long as they are dry and protected from strong winds , sleet , and snow . C. OTHER FACTORS Animal engineering , as a science , has quantified many environmental factors which influence performance and agricultural engineers have developed many alternative animal-facility designs to accommodate livestock enterprises . Some of the additional environmental factors are discussed in this section .  | 12.12 Hard-Surfaced Lots Regardless of season , mud is a stress both to animals and to the feeder or farmer . The Corn Belt feeders and those in the East and Southeast suffer more from mud than do feeders in the arid Southwest . Cattle tests at Purdue University have illustrated the value of concrete feeding floors in wet seasons . In a wet year , cattle on concrete ate about 0.7 pounds more feed and gained over a half-pound more per day , materially improving feed efficiency . There was little benefit in a dry year . Similar benefits might be expected for lambs . The value of concrete floors for hogs might be much greater than for cattle or sheep because of the greater sanitation problems and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With climate control , mechanical feed-handling and cleaning equipment , and close operating margins , maximum livestock or poultry numbers per dollar invested in facilities are desired . An example is laying hens ( Table 12-6 ) . Three birds per 12- by 18-inch cage produced at a slightly lower level per bird than were two per cage , but the profit was considerably higher . Where layers are maintained on the floor , one to one-and-one-quarter square feet per bird is recommended for birds weighing about four pounds . There is similar economic pressure to intensify livestock feeding units , especially swine , decreasing the space allotted per animal ( Table 12-7 ) . Slatted floors , which permit waste to fall into a pit below , are used in many cases to permit higher concentration , to maintain a reasonable sanitation level , and to hold down labor costs . Slatted floors are most effective , in fact , with a high animal concentration so solid waste will be worked off the tops of the slats by the animals ' feet ( Figure 12-9 ) . Table  | Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced in many western European and American dairy units and also rapidly gained acceptance for feeding sows , so individual animals can not overeat , for young calves , and even for beef cows kept part of the year in confinement . A stall about 7 feet by 4 feet is used for mature dairy cows ( see Figure 31-2 ) . The stall area is just wide enough for one animal , which is free to move in and out . The principle is that bedding in the stall remains dry and clean ; all waste is deposited in the common open area . Less bedding is used , labor is reduced , and animals are cleaner , especially important in the case of dairy cattle .  | Reproduction in farm livestock and poultry , as in other mammals and birds , is accomplished by union of the male sex cell , the sperm , with the female sex cell , the ovum , in the female reproductive tract and by gradual development in the reproductive tract of the individual or egg thus formed . This chapter will describe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transported , and united with the ovum . It will similarly tell about the ovum , and will describe the cycles of events that are peculiar to the female reproductive tract. 13.1 Male Reproductive Organs The reproductive organs of the male are similar among most species of mammals . Those of a bull are diagrammed in Figure 13-1 . The two testicles , which produce both sperm and male sex hormone , are suspended outside the abdominal cavity in the scrotum . The scrotum apparently helps control the temperature of the testicles . Extremely high temperatures interfere with sperm production , so on hot days the scrotum descends , moving away from the body heat and creating more surface area for heat dissipation . The epididymis is a storage reservoir for sperm between services , since sperm production is relatively continuous after sexual maturity . A tube ( vas deferens ) from each testicle leads into the body cavity where the two unite and join the urethra near the bladder . The urethra , therefore , carries both semen ( during mating ) and urine .  | Note the various accessory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the urethra . A primary function of these organs is to produce fluid which carries , nourishes , and perhaps activates , the sperm . The male tract of the cock ( rooster ) is shown in Figure 13-2 . The testes are inside the abdominal cavity , along the backbone and near the forward end of the kidneys . Each of the two vas deferens , which carry the sperm in seminal fluid , leads to a small papilla along the dorsal wall of the cloaca . Figure  | 13.2 Sperm Production After sexual maturity of the male , sperm production is continuous under most conditions . There is much individual variation in age at sexual maturity and initiation of sperm production , but averages are given in Table 13-1 . Table In chickens sperm production normally continues at the same general rate throughout life , but in most mammals production gradually declines in advanced ages . Because there is much individual and breed variation in age at sexual maturity and also in duration of sperm formation , these traits might be selected for and gradually changed in a herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division of special sperm " mother cells " in each testicle . The final division which produces new sperm is a special kind of cell division called meiosis , which reduces the chromosome number by half . Meiosis is explained in detail in Chapter 14 . A new sperm cell consisting of a head , a middle piece , and a tail ( Figure 13-3 ) is not immediately capable of fertilization . It must first undergo a series of maturation processes in the testicle as well as in the epididymis where the sperm are stored . Sperm are minutely small , as little as 1/20,000 ' the volume of an ovum , even though they are equivalent in hereditary significance . ' Unlike ova , which are produced in small numbers in the female , sperm are produced continuously and in large numbers . A typical ejaculate of bull semen may contain over five billion sperm , sufficient to inseminate at least 500 cows . Numbers of sperm per ejaculate are also high for other species ( Table 13-2 ) . Many environmental factors , as well as heredity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only temporary . Extreme underfeeding , especially after animals have been well fed , will decrease the formation . This is particularly significant when bulls or rams are put back with the herd or flock after being fattened for show . I M. W. H. Bishop and C. R. Austin , " Mammalian Spermatazoa , " Endeavour , XVI : 137-150.  | Figure Table Vitamin A and protein seem to be the critical nutrients involved in sperm formation in most areas of the country . Lack of these nutrients is most cocoon in dry seasons . Extremely high temperatures will decrease sperm formation and also cause a higher proportion of sperm which are incapable of fertilization . Low conception rate among ewes bred during late summer is common , and some sheep raisers keep their rams in a cellar or air-conditioned stall and let them out with the ewes only at night . High body temperatures that result from sickness or infection will also impair sperm production . 13.3 Accessory Fluids Sperm are carried in a viscous mixture of fluids , the entire mass being called semen . In mammals these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male reproductive tract ( Figure 13-1 ) , though a small portion may come from the testicles or the epididymis . In poultry the fluids are produced primarily in the testicle . In general the fluids are added to the sperm only at ejaculation . In some species it has been demonstrated that fluids from one certain organ " flush "  | the tract ahead of other fluids which might carry sperm . All functions of the fluids may not be completely known and may not be the same in all species . The main functions , however , are apparently to serve as a medium for sperm movement , to activate the previously nonmotile sperm cells , and to supply metabolizable nutrients and other essentials . The fluids contain sodium chloride , potassium chloride , nitrogen , citric acid , sugar , and several vitamins , which may be utilized by the sperm cells for energy and metabolic processes , as well as certain enzymes . Certain accessory fluids also serve as lubricants during the mating process . 13.4 Female Reproductive Organs The various parts of the mammalian female reproductive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the female correspond to the testicles of the male ; they are the site of the formation of the sex cell , the ovum . Released ova move through tubes , called oviducts , to the uterus . The ovaries are located near the kidneys in the body cavity , suspended in loose connective tissue as are other internal organs . The uterus , where embryos develop during pregnancy , lies immediately under the terminal end of the large intestine in large animals . The cervix , an orifice which is opened or closed during certain stages of the female reproductive cycle , connects the uterus to the vagina . Sperm are deposited in the vagina during natural service , and may be deposited there or in the uterus by artificial insemination . Two horns of the uterus are evident in Figure 13-4 . The forward end of each horn leads into a small convoluted tube , which extends to the vicinity Figure  | Figure of the corresponding ovary . The proximity of the ends of these tubes to the ovaries varies among species , but in all species they insure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been known of a female becoming pregnant even when one ovary had been removed and the opposite tube was tied off to restrict ova passage to the uterus . Body movements apparently insure that released ova reach the uterus . In poultry , only the left ovary is normally functional . ( Figure 13-5. ) 13.5 The Female Reproductive Cycle Whereas sperm production in males is continuous after sexual maturity and males are prone to mate at almost any time , the release of the female sex cells in mammals occurs in cyclic patterns , in relatively small numbers , and ewes , gilts , and cows will accept a male only at certain times . The reproductive organs of the female are geared to a regular , hormone-controlled cycle , interrupted only by pregnancy or by season ( in certain species ) . This cycle is called the estrous cycle . The estrous cycle is initiated by certain hormones at the time known as " sexual maturity " ( puberty ) . Completion of the estrous cycle is marked by " heat " or estrus , the time when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be defined , then , as the cycle of events from one heat period to the next . It includes the gradual development and release of the ova , other physiological changes in the female tract which prepare it for pregnancy , and heat or estrus . Length of the estrous cycle and also of heat in various animals is given in Table 13-3 . The estrous cycle is not a character istic of poultry .  | Table 13.6 Formation and Release of Ova Ova formation in the ovary corresponds to sperm production in the testicle . Ova result from the division of special cells in the ovary , with the chromosome number in the resulting ova cells being reduced by one-half . Whereas sperm production in males occurs after sexual maturity , ova are produced earlier , even during embryonic development of the female . These ova remain latent until the female approaches puberty . Hormones produced in the female , as it approaches maturity , cause enlargement of follicles , each of which contains a single ovum . In litter-bearing animals , such as gilts , several follicles develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species , such as cattle , only one follicle may fully develop . The mature follicle , distended by accumulated fluid , protrudes from the ovary surface like a water blister , near the end of the estrous cycle . During or after heat ( Table 13-3 ) the follicle or follicles gradually rupture , releasing the ovum from the follicle along with the fluids . This is called ovulation . The ovum or ova then pass down the oviducts leading toward the uterus . The right oviduct and ovary usually degenerate early in a pullet 's life . At sexual maturity , ova ( yolks ) on the left ovary develop and are successively released into the oviduct . The thicker white or albumen is secreted by the magnum section , to surround the yolk ; the isthmus secretes two membranes around the thick albumen . The thin albumen forms in the uterus ( possibly from the thick albumen ) over a 16- to 20-hour period . The uterus then adds the shell . ( See Figure 13-5. ) 13.7 Mating and Conception Both the sperm and ovum are living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sperm of mammals seldom live longer than 30 hours after entering the female reproductive tract ( though sperm of poultry usually live longer ,  | some surviving as long as 30 days ) . Ova probably survive longer , but evidence indicates that embryos resulting from older ova are much more likely to die before implantation or during development . This means that in natural service livestock matings must be made near the time of ovulation . In natural service in livestock ejaculated semen , containing millions of sperm cells , is deposited in the vagina . The sperm move rapidly through the cervix and uterus , and up the oviducts , often in a matter of minutes . This movement of sperm is probably caused by uterine contractions stimulated by hormones . Ova move down the oviduct much more slowly , often requiring several days . Fertilization , or union of the sperm and ovum , invariably occurs in the oviduct . Though sperm reach the oviduct and vicinity of the ovum within minutes after mating , evidence indicates that the first sperm may not be the one which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to remain in the oviduct environment several hours before being capable of fertilization . During mating in poultry the seminal fluid , carrying several million sperm , is transmitted from the papilla to the oviduct opening in the cloaca of the hen . The sperm move up through the oviduct and congregate in and near the funnel of the oviduct . From one mating , fertilization can occur over many successive days , sometimes as long as 30 days . The exact , detailed process of sperm and ovum combination is not completely known . In some species the surface of the sperm head attaches itself to the ovum and secretes an enzyme which may allow the sperm to enter the ovum . The tail of the sperm , giving some motility , may also help the Figure 13-6 . Identical twins result when an ovum divides after fertilization . They have , therefore , identical genotypes . ( Iowa State University )  | sperm penetrate the membranes around the ovum . Enzymes of the sperm apparently continue to play a role as the head , and then the tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ovum cytoplasm . Membranes surrounding the ovum then change to prevent entrance of other sperm . Inside the fertilized egg , the nucleus of the sperm and the nucleus of the ovum come into close contact , nuclear membranes disappear , and the complete chromosome groups become evident . Then begins the first cell division and growth of the zygote . In the cow , ewe , or sow , thefertili7ed ovum or . zygote , if it survives , continues to move slowly down the oviduct to the uterine horn where it attaches to the uterine wall . The zygote may include several cells by this time , as the result of cell division . At the implantation site , capillaries develop to nourish the developing embryo during pregnancy . The optimum time for mating livestock , to achieve the highest conception rate , is influenced by the time of ovulation in relation to the heat period . In cattle , more will conceive at first service if bred near the end of heat , since ovulation does not occur until 12 to 15 hours after heat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sperm should not be deposited longer than necessary before ovulation . In ewes and sows , where ovulation occurs during but near the end of heat , it is easier to synchronize mating with ovulation . Growth of the chick embryo begins immediately after fertilization and continues as long as the egg is above 82 ? F. The few fertilized eggs that may enter consumer channels do not show embryonic growth because they are held under refrigeration. 13.8 Artificial Insemination Artificial insemination is used for several reasons : ( 1 ) to spread more widely the merits of a top quality sire , ( 2 ) to eliminate the cost and risk of maintaining a sire for a small herd or flock , and ( 3 ) to prevent spreading of certain reproductive diseases . Artificial insemination is not new ; it was reported used as early as 1322 in horses . In 19682 over half the U.S. dairy cows and heifers were bred artificially . Because a single ejaculate of semen contains many times the number of sperm needed to breed a female , the semen can be diluted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of females that might be inseminated per ejaculate of semen in several species . Semen to be used for artificial insemination may be collected by use of a dummy , a teaser cow ( sow or ewe ) , or an electro-ejaculator . The latter instrument causes ejaculation over a 15- to 20-minute period by means of electric impulse . With a dummy or teaser Footnote  | Figure female , semen is collected in an " artificial vagina , " made of soft rubber and maintained at body temperature . Poultry semen is usually collected by an abdominal massage technique . The semen is checked for sperm concentration and motility , then diluted to the desired concentration . If it is to be used fresh , it is usually maintained at exactly 40 ? F , or under carbon dioxide at room temperature . For storage and later use , it is frozen slowly . Freezing , like hibernation , slows metabolism . Because the sperm are single , living cells with little environmental protection , they must be handled with care . Special diluents which help keep the sperm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill sperm , the temperature is lowered very slowly . If bovine semen is held below - 110 ? F , it can be stored successfully for several years . For use , the frozen semen is thawed slowly . It is then deposited by means of a pipette or other instrument into the reproductive tract of the female ( Figure 13-7 ) . In mammals the pipette is usually inserted through the cervix and the semen is deposited directly into the uterus . If any vitality of  | the sperm has been lost during storage , depositing the semen in the uterus may be of benefit . In poultry , the semen is usually blown , by means of a syringe or small tube , into the oviduct opening in the wall of the cloaca . Poultry have been experimentally inseminated by injection of semen through the abdominal wall into the infundibulum area of the oviduct . 13.9 Estrus Control Practicability of artificial insemination has encouraged efforts to achieve control of the estrous cycle so that all or a specific portion of a herd or flock may be bred at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized and efficient production system . Enough gilts could be mated at a predetermined time to fully utilize , at farrowing , a set of farrowing crates . All pigs would be essentially the same age , and could be handled as an intact group until marketing . With range cows , daily riding to detect cows in heat and sorting them out for insemination would theoretically be eliminated . If all came in heat at the same time , all could be inseminated while handling the group only once . Progesterone , produced routinely by the corpus luteum ( the follicle scar tissue on the ovary ) to inhibit development of other ova follicles and reoccurrence of estrus once a female has conceived , can be chemically produced . It can be injected in cows , ewes , or sows at specific levels to prevent estrus . Several days after treatment is terminated , the follicle or follicles mature and the animal will come into estrus . Other compounds , with progesterone-like effects , are effective when administered orally , so can be mixed in the ration . In research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect , but is encouraging . Of 27 heifers fed 0.5 mg melengestrol acetate for 18 days in Oklahoma research , ' only one showed estrus during the feeding , and 74 percent were in estrus within 5 days after the compound was removed from the ration . In a similar control group of heifers , 35 percent were in estrus during the same 5-day period . As in natural estrous cycles , not all females conceive during the first estrous period . Figure 13-8 shows , however , that conception , and therefore lambing , in ewes can be concentrated at specific and predetermined times . In this Wyoming research over 700 ewes of four breeds were fed various levels of **31;213;TOOLONG or chlormadinone acetate for a 14-day period . 13.10 Multiple Ovulation A 90 percent calf crop ? 90 calves weaned per 100 cows ? is considered satisfactory by most ranchers . A 150 percent lamb crop is a reasonable goal , and  | Figure eight pigs weaned per litter is standard . Economic incentive to increase output per breeding animal is high , however , and new knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flocks permit higher reproduction rates . In a cow , usually but one ovum matures during the estrous cycle and is released at estrus . In Oklahoma research , 4however , a combination of hormone treatments , two injections of PMS ( pregnant mare serum , which causes development of more than one ovum during the cycle ) and one injection of chorionic gonadotropin ( which causes the several ova to be released ) , resulted in a high proportion of multiple births . Of 81 cows treated , 52 conceived at the service immediately following hormone treatment and these 52 dropped 90 calves ? one set of quintuplets , 2 sets of quadruplets , 8 sets of triplets , 12 pairs of twins , and 29 singles . A series of problems remain to be solved . There was high death loss in the triplets , quadruplets and quintuplets , suggesting the need to control the ovulation rate to produce twins . Approximately one-half of the multiple-  | birth cows had retained placentas ( the placenta had to be removed by hand ) . Also a higher proportion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conceive during the first three months of the subsequent breeding season . Because gestation length for the multiple-birth calves was shorter , by two to three weeks , the calves were physiologically younger at birth , so more subject to environmental stress . On the other hand , if the associated problems can be solved , the shorter gestation length could be a significant economic advantage ? more pregnancies in a cow 's lifetime . Table 13-4 illustrates the effect of a single injection of PMS at weaning ( prior to the first postweaning estrus ) on reproduction of sows the next season at the Missouri experiment station . Table Similar responses have been observed in ewes ' at Texas Tech when follicle-stimulating hormone was injected on the thirteenth day of the estrous cycle and luteinizing hormone was injected at the onset of estrus . Multiple ovulation permits more effective use of top quality dams in a breeding herd or flock . In a commercial herd or flock , the purpose would be to intensify the livestock production system . Other efforts to intensify are also used . Cows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Estrus control , multiple ovulation , and selection of breeding stock ( especially in sheep ) that will mate and conceive any season , and adjustments in herd or flock management , such as early weaning , can permit 5 crops of lambs in 3 years or three crops in two years , or 5 litters of pigs in 2 years . 13.11 Pregnancy The period of time during which the fetus develops in the uterus is called pregnancy . After conception and implantation of the fertilized ovum to the Footnote  | wall of the uterus , the regular estrous cycle is interrupted for the duration of pregnancy . Approximate length of pregnancy ( gestation period ) is given in Table 13-5 . It varies considerably among animals and is influenced by age , breed , and number of embryos developed . Table Maintenance of pregnancy is dependent upon progesterone , a hormone produced by the corpus luteum , which develops from follical scar tissue on the ovary after ovulation . Degeneration or removal of the corpus luteum invariably results in abortion . It was mentioned in Section 13.7 that age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pregnancy , in that older ova are less likely to survive after fertilization . There is also evidence that embryos resulting from older sperm are less likely to survive . Nutritional influences on maintenance of pregnancy and number of embryos surviving are discussed in Chapter 11 . The many reproductive diseases which can terminate pregnancy by abortion or resorption , such as brucellosis and leptospirosis , are not discussed here . Though fertilized ova divide rapidly , embryos are still very small even after two-thirds of pregnancy has elapsed . Most of the tissue growth occurs during the last one-third of pregnancy ? or , in the case of poultry , incubation ( Figure 13-9 ) . 13.12 Incubation and Hatching The normal time for embryonic development of the fertilized egg to the hatching event is 21 days . Fertilized eggs may be stored several days while a suflicient number for an incubator accumulate . These should be stored a minimum time , no longer than seven days , and at 55 ? to 60 ? F. Longer storage or holding at higher or lower temperature normally reduces hatchability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with turkey eggs . The head of the developing embryo generally is toward the larger end o the egg , where the air cell is located . Hatching eggs are generally stored , and placed in the incubator , with the large end up . The yolk tends to float , which could permit the embryo to move against the shell where contamination or dehydration could kill the embryo . The eggs are therefore tilted back and forth several times daily during incubation to keep the yolk centered in the albumen and away from the shell .  | Incubators for chicken eggs are generally operated at about 100 ? F , with about 60 percent relative humidity and at least 21 percent oxygen ( the amount in air at sea level ) . Fans provide circulation in the incubator to provide sufficient oxygen and to hold the carbon dioxide level below 0.5 percent . Significant deviations from the above will reduce hatchability . At high altitudes , supplemental oxygen is sometimes necessary .  | How are characteristics inherited ? passed from one generation to the next ? The only physical link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sperm from the sire and the ova from the dam , which unite at conception . The answer may lie , then , in these cells , what they contain , how they develop in the testicle of the sire or ovary of the dam , how the zygote divides after conception , and just how the contents of these cells exert their effects . These topics are all included in the discipline called genetics . To gain an appreciation of genetics , and to have it answer a few questions effectively , you must first acquaint yourself with a few terms . A gene is the simplest unit of inheritance . Physically , a gene is apparently a chemical compound called a nucleic acid . Nucleic acids , ultramicroscopic and therefore invisible even through powerful microscopes , contain several units each of simple sugars , phosphate , and nitrogen-containing compounds . These units might be hooked together in a variety of patterns , so various genes differ in their chemical structure . Late in 1969 scientists at Harvard University reported that they had chemically isolated a gene from the bacterium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinitely more complex , so they will be more difficult to isolate and study . A chromosome carries many genes in a row , like peas in a pod . Apparently a chromosome is a long protein molecule , to which are chemically attached the various nucleic acids ( genes ) . Each gene occupies a specific location on a certain chromosome . Chromosomes occur in pairs in most body cells . So , then , do genes . One member of each pair of chromosomes  | is inherited from the male parent while the other member of that pair is inherited from the female parent . The number of chromosome pairs in cells of farm animals is given in Table Table 14-1 . The total number of genes in cells or on certain chromosome pairs is not known . Though much genetic study is directed toward individual genes and how they work , most economically important traits of livestock and poultry are influenced or affected by many different genes . Transmittal of single genes or a very small number of genes can be easily studied , and a few examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are involved , inheritance patterns are not so simple and different techniques are used for studying them . These procedures , so important in animal inheritance , are discussed in Sections 14.5 through 14.7. 14.1 Transmission of Genes Every cell in the body , except sperm and ova , has a full set of chromosome pairs . Each sperm and ovum carries one member of each chromosome pair . This is accomplished by " reduction division " ( meiosis ) during the development of the sperm cell in the testicle , or the ovum in the ovary ( Figure 14-1 ) . Note that in formation of the sperm cell in the testicle a normal cell divides after one member of each chromosome pair migrates to each end of the cell . Two sperm are formed from one normal cell . These sperm develop as described in Chapter 13 and in time are capable of combining with an ovum produced by the ovary of the female . Cell division in the ovary of the female is similar . The ovum formed and shed from the ovary contains one member of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reduction division differs from mitosis , which is normal cell division during tissue growth . In mitosis everything inside the cell , including each member of the chromosome pairs , divides so that the new cells formed  | Figure contain a full complement of chromosome pairs , and the resulting new cells are exactly like the original cells . It is emphasized that the sperm and the ovum each contain one member of each chromosome pair . When a sperm and ovum unite , then , the resulting fertilized cell ( zygote ) contains a full set of chromosome pairs . Chromosome Number 1 present in the sperm matches up with Chromosome Number 1 present in the ovum . The other chromosomes pair up similarly . Since the genes are carried on chromosomes , things that happen to chromosomes also happen to genes . One member of each pair of genes migrates as a part of the chromosome to opposite ends of the cell . When the cell divides , each new sperm or ovum carries one member of each gene pair . Then , at conception , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do likewise . 14.2 Examples of Simple Inheritance All livestock and poultry traits , visible or measurable , are influenced by one or more gene pairs . In most cases the economically important traits are influenced by several gene pairs .  | First let us study some characteristics which are influenced by just one pair of genes . The mechanism of inheritance is relatively simple . These examples will also illustrate to us why offspring may be similar or dissimilar from their parents in certain characteristics . The first illustration is the polled characteristic in European breeds of beef cattle . P designates a gene for the polled characteristic ; p designates a gene for horns . If the genotype ( genetic makeup in the cell ) is PP , the animal is polled . If the genotype is pp , the animal is horned . If the animal received a p from one parent and a P from the other parent , the genotype is Pp and the animal is polled . The polled gene ( P ) is dominant over the horned gene ( p ) . Geneticists use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recessiveness . In the preceding paragraph there were several new terms introduced . Perhaps these should be explained in more detail . Genotype refers to the genes and gene combinations on the chromosomes in the cells of the individual . The phenotype of an individual is the visible or obvious characteristic , such as the presence or absence of horns . In the above example if the genotype is pp , the phenotype is horns . If the genotype is PP , the phenotype is polled . The same phenotype would be observed with the genotype Pp . We see , therefore , that the phenotype or visible characteristics of an animal do not always disclose the genotype . Illustrations in Figure 14-2 provide bases for discussing inheritance of the polled characteristic . In Example 1 the sire has the genotype PP . The dam , or cow , has the genotype pp . After reduction division in the testicle , one P is present in each of the sperm that develops . After reduction division in the ovary of the dam , one p is present in each ovum produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception , the resulting zygote will contain the Pp genotype and the offspring will be polled . In the second example , where the sire is also polled but has a different genotype , Pp , two kinds of sperm will be produced . Half will contain the P gene ; the other half , p . All ova produced by the dam will contain the p gene . So if by chance a sperm containing the P gene unites with an ovum , the resulting zygote will have a Pp genotype and the calf will be polled . If , however , a p-containing sperm unites with the ovum a horned calf with the pp genotype will be born . What determines which type of sperm will unite with a particular ovum ? Only chance . In this case half of the sperm carry the p gene , half carry the P gene . So it is a 50:50 chance that either will unite with a particular ovum . In the third example both the sire and dam are horned ( genotype pp ) . Obviously any zygote formed will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can be transmitted from the parents . Both the sire and the dam are polled , in Example 4 , but their genotype is Pp . Half of the sperm will carry P ( for polledness ) and half will carry p ( for horns ) . The same will be true of the ova . Chances are 25 percent that  | Figure a calf born will have the PP genotype , 50 percent that it will have a Pp genotype , and 25 percent that it will carry app genotype . If a large number of such matings are made , 75 percent of the calves will be polled ; 25 percent will be horned . Further recognize that two-thirds of the polled calves will carry a recessive gene p for horns . It is obviously impossible to look at a polled animal and tell whether or not it carries the recessive p gene . ( Small hornlike scurs , more often seen on male calves in breeds or families that are generally polled , are apparently caused by a different set of genes . ) The above series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chance . Another characteristic apparently influenced by just one pair of genes is  | the color of Angus cattle . B represents black , and is dominant over b , which represents red . Most Angus cattle carry the BB genotype . A few carry the Bb genotype . These , of course , are not apparent since they are black . A few individuals carry the bb genotype and are red . Red Angus apparently originated from matings of two black cattle where both carried the red recessive gene . It is apparent that Red Angus cattle will breed true for color when mated within the breed . Since they carry only the b gene for color , this is the only gene they can transmit to their offspring . Skin color , white versus yellow , in poultry is apparently influenced by a single gene pair . W represents white , and is dominant over w , which represents yellow . A hen with the WW genotype will produce only white-skinned offspring , regardless of the genotype of the male to which she is mated . A fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " snorter dwarf " characteristic in beef cattle ( Figure 14-3 ) . Dwarf calves often die at birth or soon after . Those which live grow slowly and inefficiently , and are an economic loss to the producer . N represents normal body size ; n represents dwarf . Since Nis dominant over n , it is difficult to pick out the normal-sized animals which carry the dwarf gene . Only when such animals produce a dwarf calf are they positively identified . Since n is recessive , both parents are then known to carry this gene . In this situation , though Nis dominant and Nn animals appear essentially normal , there are a few telltale signs that expose some dwarf gene carriers . Often the dwarf carrier bulls or cows have shorter front legs and a shorter , wider head , and identifiable ridges on the ventral side of lumbar vertebrae ( detectable by X ray ) . The previous illustrations show why some offspring are like their parents in certain characteristics and some offspring are not like their parents .  | One can also understand why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in certain traits and the sire in certain other characteristics . Not all cases of simple inheritance involve complete dominance and recessiveness . There may be partial dominance , or two members of a gene pair may be equal in power , neither being dominant over the other . Color of shorthorn cattle is an example . R designates red , W designates white . An animal with an RR genotype is red , one with a WW genotype is white , and one with an RW genotype is usually roan or spotted . 14.3 Genotype and Phenotype The genotype of an animal is a listing of the specific genes carried on the chromosomes . The phenotype is a summary of the visible or measurable characteristics . A black Angus bull may have the genotype PPBBNN , indicating he is polled , black , and normal in size . If this were true , the genotype and phenotype would correspond . Since P , B , and N are dominant , it is apparent the phenotype of an animal discloses some information about the genotype . Any Angus that is polled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least one P gene , one B gene , and one N gene . Breeders want to know as much as possible about the genotype of their breeding stock . They know a normal size bull carries one N gene , but what do they know about the second member of the pair ? A bull calf born without horns is known to carry one P gene . How can you know what the other gene is ? Or suppose a bull calf born with horns was dehorned early and there is no evidence that the horns were ever present . Obviously the phenotype , in this case , does not disclose the genotype . In many traits the phenotype does n't disclose fully the genotype . Though a ewe lamb may carry genes favorable for rapid growth , heavy wool production , and high prolificness at maturity , environment will determine whether or not the genes are ever demonstrated . The Iamb 's mother may die soon after birth , leaving her without proper nourishment , and she grows slowly . She may not receive an adequate ration , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , after maturity , she might be mated to a sterile ram , so her genetic prolificness is not demonstrated . Though a chicken may carry the genotype for yellow skin , a ration composed largely of grain sorghum and lacking yellow corn or alfalfa meal may not provide sufficient quantities of yellow pigment to make the skin yellow . Environment often greatly masks genotype , or hereditary potential . This topic is discussed in more detail in Chapter 15. 14.4 Inheritance of Sex What determines the sex of a zygote ? Again chance . Each normal body cell contains a pair of chromosomes called the sex chromosomes . Among  | mammals both members of this chromosome pair are similar in the female and are called X. Hence the female genotype for the sex characteristic is XX . One chromosome of the male is like that of the female and is called X ; the other has a different content of sex genes and is designated Y. The male genotype , therefore , is X Y. Just how the X and Y chromosomes differ is not presently known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for the sex chromosomes . In reduction division in the testicle , the X chromosome from the sperm mother cell becomes a part of one sperm , the Y chromosome inhabits the other . Half of the sperm carried in semen , therefore , carry the X chromosome , half carry Y. Ova shed in the female , however , carry only the X chromosome . At conception , there is a 50 percent chance that an X-carrying sperm will unite with an ovum to produce a zygote with an XX genotype ( a female ) . There is also a 50 percent chance that a Y-carrying sperm will unite with an ovum and a male zygote ( XY ) will develop . Hence , we say that sex is determined by chance . Small variations from the 50 percent proportion of males and females born are not unusual . These may be due to chance , to difference in survival or activity of sperm carrying different sex chromosomes , or difference in survival of embryos according to sex . There is no known scientific basis for the common belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular sex . For poultry the reverse designations , XX for the male and XY the female , could be used . Poultry geneticists , however , generally use the designations ZZ for the male and ZW for the female . The W has denoted the lack of one of the " sex chromosomes , " with the belief that the female carries but one sex chromosome per cell , not a pair . Recent research at the University of Minnesota has shown the presence of the W chromosome , although it appears to be nonfunctional . This explains certain " sex-linked " traits . Other genes on the sex chromosomes may influence certain traits , the expression of these traits in part dependent on whether one or two of the genes are present . Two would be present in the male , one in the female , in the case of poultry . 14.5 Most Traits Influenced by Several Gene Pairs In livestock and poultry improvement , it becomes necessary to go on front relatively simple inheritance patterns and recognize quickly that most economically important traits , such as rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , milk production , and carcass merit are influenced by several gene pairs . It becomes very complicated to trace inheritance of a trait  | Figure when two , three , or more pairs of genes are involved . The number of possible gene combinations in invididuals becomes tremendous . Animal improvement by selection boils down to the task of selecting animals with many good genes . This is accomplished by putting all candidates for herd or flock sire , or all potential replacement heifers , gilts , or ewes , in the same or similar environment and then selecting the one that performs best in terms of the characterstic being selected for ? gain , finish , feed efficiency , egg production , wool production , etc . ( Figure 14-4 ) . The one that performs the best in a certain trait when the environment is held constant is probably the one with the most good genes for that trait . This concept may not be as glamorous or as striking as our discussion on horns or dwarfism , but it is the whole foundation of practical poultry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is achieved slowly , ultimate possibilities for improvement are practically unlimited . We know , for example , that milk production in livestock is influenced by at least ten pairs of genes . The percentage of butterfat in milk is influenced by at least ten pairs . It is reasonable to assume ( based on genetic studies ) that other economically important characteristics are influenced by relatively large numbers of gene pairs .  | If we assume that each pair of genes . occupies a particular location on the chromosome , then our goal in livestock and poultry selection is simply to make sure that the genes which inhabit each location are on the " positive " side . That is , we want these genes to be the ones which will cause faster gains , more efficient feed utilization , higher quality carcasses , higher milk production , etc. , rather than genes which might work in the opposite direction . We almost forget the concept of dominance and recessiveness , though we recognize it does continue to play a role . Evidence indicates that in economically important characteristics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more often than not , dominant genes are the good genes ? at least in the characteristics of fast growth , efficiency , litter size , and a few other characteristics ( Section 18.5 ) . 14.6 Effective Improvement by Selection Four rules for effective improvement of livestock and poultry by selection are listed below . Following these rules closely allows progressive breeders to make relatively rapid progress . It is assumed , of course , that selection is based on economically important traits . The rules are : 1 . Have maximum genetic variation . This is further discussed in Section 14.7. 2 . Spend selection efforts on traits largely influenced by heredity . This means the traits where phenotype is a good indicator of the genotype . Chapter 15 is devoted to the different traits in this respect . 3 . Observe or measure accurately the traits carried by a prospective breeding animal ( Chapter 16 ) . 4 . Use the selected animal or animals ( carrying the traits you want ) most effectively . Effective programs are discussed in Chapter 17. 14.7 Genetic Variation Many poultry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniformity is desirable in a breeding herd or flock . For effective and rapid improvement by selection , this is not true . Breeders naturally take much pride in a herd or flock that is uniformly good . This is certainly justifiable . But the emphasis should be on merit rather than on uniformity per se . Cattle and lamb feeders like to buy uniform groups of animals for feeding . Packers are usually impressed by groups of slaughter hogs , lambs , or cattle that are uniform in size , conformation , and finish . They often hid higher on such a group than on a group of the same average quality but with more variation . Carcasses from a uniform group might all he sold to the same  | Figure retailer , and there is less chance of there being an extremely low quality animal in the group . Egg producers want uniformly sized eggs . Broiler producers want broilers that will all reach market weight at the same time . This justifiable preference for uniformity is well imbedded in the livestock and poultry industry . Prospective buyers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the herd or flock in which the breeding stock was raised . But a selected breeding animal ? cockerel , bull , ram , boar , or female ? does n't transmit " uniformity " or " variation " to their offspring . They transmit genes . Also realize that a breeding herd or flock does not erAT ' ' IrTfIo'Tooked at and to take pride in . They exist to be improved and to serve as a source of progressively better breeding stock for commercial producers . And little improvement can be made within a herd or flock that is extremely uniform ( Figure 14-5 ) . The groups of gilts owned by Jones and Smith , illustrated in Figure -  | 14-5 , average the same in total merit score , though Jones ' gilts are much more uniform . Both breeders plan to keep the five best gilts in their herd for breeding and will sell the remainder for slaughter . Which breeder will make the most improvement in quality ? Smith will obviously make much more progress . First , the better gilts will be easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , their phenotypic rank is more apt to be a true indicator of their genotypic rank or relative breeding quality . And the average of selected gilts is much higher in Smith 's herd than in Jones ' . Smith can " reach " farther by selection , so his progress will be faster .  | Heritability may be defined as the relative importance of heredity in influencing certain poultry and livestock traits . The only other influence , of course , is environment . Heritability of traits may range from zero to 100 percent . Turn to Section 3.1 for a quick review of where in the life cycle of farm animals heredity and environment exert their effects . 15.1 Heredity vs . Environmental Influences Since the genotype ( heredity ) of an animal is established at conception , it can be said that the genetic potential of an animal is determined then . If genes for prolificness , rapid gaining , efficient feed utilization , high carcass merit , and other desired traits are provided by the uniting sperm and ovum , the embryo which develops and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The degree to which the potential is reached during the animal 's lifetime is determined by environment ? ration , housing , climate , incidence of disease , management , etc . If environment is excellent , the high potential may be approached or even reached . The best rations , shelter , sanitation , and management will allow rapid gains , efficient feed utilization , efficient reproduction , and top carcass quality . If the genotype of an animal provides a low potential , however , it is apparent that even the best rations , shelter , sanitation , and management will not give top production . Good environment will help , though , and will allow the animal to demonstrate the limit of its productive potential . 733  | Environment may influence some traits more than others , after the potential ( genotype ) has been established at conception . The polled trait in beef cattle is established by heredity ( genotype PP ) . Coat color is established by heredity . An Angus with genotype BB is black ; one with bb is red . Whitefeathered birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the red hair coat . Suffolk sheep transmit the distinctly black color markings on the head and shanks . These traits are high in heritability ; heredity is the major influence and environment exerts little effect . But how about prolificness ? Think of all the environmental factors that can encourage or limit litter size in hogs , egg production in hens , the percent calf crop in a cow herd , or the incidence of twins in a sheep flock . Fertility of the sire , time of mating , ration amount and quality , incidence of disease , possibility of mechanical injury , and other factors are all important . Even though the genetic potential has been established , many different environmental factors can exert much influence on whether that potential is reached . Heritability of such a trait is usually low . It is apparent that both heredity and environment influence all livestock traits , but in varying degrees . Figure 15-1 illustrates one technique used to demonstrate effects of both heredity and environment on rate of gain in cattle . Two sets of identical twin steers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pen 1 and the other member of each set in Pen 2 . The two pens were in different locations , there was a contrast in shelter provided , and rations fed in the two pens were different . Steers A and A ' were not related to steers B and B ' . The difference of 0.6 pounds gain per day between the steers in Lot 1 and those in Lot 2 indicates a sizable environmental influence . It is not apparent which of the contrasting environmental influences exerted the largest effect ? ration , location , or shelter . Averages in the right column indicate a genetic difference in gaining ability . Since one member of each pair was subjected to the same environment , this difference of 0.2 pounds per day is apparently hereditary . Figure  | In the above case environmental factors had more influence on rate of gain than did the differences in heredity . This is not always true . If the two pens had been adjacent , with similar rations and facilities , the difference caused by environmental factors would have been smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relative importance of heredity in influencing certain poultry and livestock traits . Heritability might be defined another way . There are many differences among animals in each characteristic . The total variation that exists among animals in a certain trait is caused by heredity and environment . The proportion of the variation or differences caused by variations in heredity ( ancestry or parentage ) is the heritability . If , for example , no caustic , cutters , saws , or other device were ever used for dehorning cattle and no broken horns occurred by accident , presence or absence of horns on cattle would be caused solely by differences in genotype . Heritability of this trait would be essentially 100 percent . Actually , however , accidents and fights do occur , some farmers and ranchers dehorn while some do not , and there is variation in how good a job they do . Environmental variations do exist , so presence or absence of horns is not caused solely by heredity . Heritability of the trait is therefore somewhat less than 100 percent . Heritability means other things too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenotype in a certain trait . For example , if heritability of leanness ( muscling ) in hogs is high , a boar 's degree of leanness should disclose fairly closely his genotype for leanness . ( Remember that most traits , such as leanness , are influenced by many genes and the individual genes are not named or designated . But in this case it would be apparent whether or not the boar carried many genes which promoted leanness . ) Heritability means the degree of relationship between phenotype and breeding value . If heritability for leanness is high , a lean boar has " lean " genes , and these are the genes he will transmit to his offspring . At Miles City , Montana , a few years ago a " Line 10 " bull ranked top in rate of gain among seven bulls tested on a standard ration . A year and a half later steers sired by each bull were compared in a similar feeding test . The group of steers sired by the " Line 10 " bull ranked first . In no case were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sires by more than one rank . This illustrates that rate of gain is heritable , influenced considerably by heredity. 15.3 The Trait is Heritable The trait is heritable ; not the animal . Though we must select or reject a  | Heredity establishes the potential of all traits , but environment influences some much more than it influences others . Therefore , heritability of different traits varies within a species ( Table 15-1 ) . Note that , regardless of species , those traits related to body or carcass structure and physical composition are more highly inherited than " performance " traits , especially traits observed or measured before weaning . This simply means that environmental factors on farms and ranches or other production units ? ration , housing , disease control , management , etc. ? can be a greater benefit or detriment to prolificness , preweaning growth rate , or livability before weaning , than they can be to body composition . It may be worthwhile to discuss the influences of environment on certain traits , starting first with those low in heritability . Prolificness is generally low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't necessarily produce large litters . A number of experiment stations have demonstrated that ewes born as singles are almost as likely to give birth to twins as ewes that were born as twins . Since multiple births are rare in cattle , the interval between calvings is used as a measure of prolificness , and the heritability of this , too , is generally low . Note that the heritability of services required per conception is low among dairy cattle . Environmental factors , such as disease or injury , may be the main reasons cows do not settle at the first service . Many swine breeders consistently mark and save for breeding only gilts that are from large litters . The value of this practice might be questioned . The large litter demonstrates that the dam had a genetic potential for high prolificness and that environment was apparently favorable for realization of this potential . Presumably , some of the genes for prolificness would be transmitted to the gilts in question . But there is no guarantee that environment will be equally favorable for these gilts . Similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ litter will inherit a low genetic potential . The fertility of the boar used , condition and feeding level at breeding , time during estrus when the dam was bred , feeding level during pregnancy , incidence of disease , or possibility of mechanical injury ? any or all of these could have severely limited litter size . It is possible that a gilt in a small litter could have inherited a high genetic potential for polificness . The heritability values for type or conformation score ( or " type classification " in dairy cattle ) are not usually high . This may be surprising , especially since much selection of breeding stock is done visually and there has been considerable emphasis on " type " in the showring . Remember that heritability values are calculated , usually from data which show how much more closely relatives appear or perform than do nonrelatives . Data may be actual weights , carcass measurements , etc. , but for type-scoring the scores arc subjective . A scale will measure weight of relatives with a consistent degree of pre-  | cision . But type-scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) mental attitude that particular day , ( 2 ) other animals seen since the last group or previous generation was scored , ( 3 ) angle from which the animal is viewed , ( 4 ) hair coat , ( 5 ) finish , ( 6 ) temperament of the animal , etc . These factors and others constitute a source of " error " and invariably lower the heritability estimate calculated . It is therefore apparent that the actual heritability of type or conformation may be higher than the values in Table 15-1 indicate . But remember , if the man scoring the animals is subjective and makes some errors because of it , so will you when you visually select a bull , ram , boar , or breeding female . Feeding performance of livestock and poultry is apparently inherited to a rather high degree . Values given in Table 15-1 are from about 30 to 60 for gain and efficiency . For animals confined to a feedlot or growing house an important part of the environment is uniform and contributes less to performance variation , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , animals confined to feedlots or growing houses are all fed high-energy rations designed for fast gains and relatively quick marketing . Note that heritability of post weaning pasture gains of beef cattle is only about three-fifths as high as heritability of feedlot gains . Milk production , butterfat percentage , and related factors are significantly influenced by heredity , though differences in environment ? feeding , age at first calving , methods of milking , etc. ? also contribute considerably to the variations in production which exist . Heritability is high enough to indicate that it pays to save heifers from top producing cows . Variations among carcass traits of meat animals are largely influenced by heredity . Vertebrae number in swine , for example , is established early during embryonic development , giving little time for environmental effects to play a role . The same thing would be generally true for carcass length , leg length , etc. , which are primarily a function of skeletal proportions . The ratio of lean to fat is highly inherited , and this is economically very important . The relatively high heritability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may affect tenderness relatively little ( see Section 26.2 ) . Perhaps tenderness can be achieved by selection . 15.4 What if a Trait Is Highly Heritable ? Selection will be effective , and for several reasons . Leanness in hogs is used to illustrate this point . First , boars and gilts that are lean probably are lean because they have genes for leanness . You can pick breeding stock with confidence . The " phenotype " corresponds well with the " genotype . " Presumably these " lean " genes will be transmitted to the offspring and will he a major influence in causing the offspring to he lean . The phenotype of the offspring will also  | correspond well to the genotype . In other words , if heritability of a trait is high , potential breeding animals with that trait will be good breeders for that trait ? they 'll tend to put that trait in their offspring . Since selection is very effective , you can make rapid progress by selection . This is especially true in hogs or poultry where reproductive rate is high . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are selecting for is highly heritable and economically important , you can afford to pay well for a sire that has the trait . He will bring you quick and high return on your investment if he is used effectively . 15.5 What if a Trait is Low in Heritability ? Environment masks the genotype . It is difficult to select herd or flock replacements with confidence . Though a ewe may have been born a single , she may have genes for high prolificness . How is a breeder to distinguish between her and another ewe born a single and without genes for high prolificness ? Once breeding animals are selected and mated , individual offspring will not perform so closely to their genotype . Environmental factors will mask the genotype here , too . So in effect , selection is less effective and improvement by selection is much slower . Where heritability of a trait is low , this means the breeder might spend less time , effort , and money on sire selection , but spend more time , effort , and money trying to improve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices , check sires for fertility , feed for top reproduction ( Chapter 11 ) , provide adequate facilities , and be there at farrowing , calving , or lambing time . Even yet , it may be difficult for the reader to appreciate that prolificness in farm animals is primarily controlled by environment and little influenced by heredity . Most farmers can cite numerous cases where gilts or boars from large litters beget large litters ? where selection for prolificness was apparently effective . But realize that the average livestock producer who selects rigidly and carefully is also a top-notch manager and caretaker . Breeders who have ear-notched thousands of pigs and consistently selected for litter size might disbelieve recent research demonstrating that much of the improvement that has occurred in litter size was automatic and would have happened without conscious selection . On any farm where there might be an equal number of large and small litters , there would be automatic selection for prolificness . With absolutely no conscious selection , and gilts being saved for the breeding herd at random , more gilts from large litters would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same would be true for other species ? dairy and beef cattle , sheep , or poultry . Ceasing to select for prolificness in farm livestock is not being suggested  | here . If a cow calves every 12 months , you know she has the genetic potential ( genotype ) for relatively high prolificness . If a ewe gives birth to twins or triplets , she too has a high genetic potential for prolificness . So does a sow that farrows 15 pigs . And these genes can likely be transmitted to the offspring . So if environment can be made and kept optimum , selection for prolificness can be worthwhile . Probably one reason that heritabilities of reproductive traits are low is that natural selection has , over time , developed species or breeds whose reproductive rates are compatible with the environment in which they are normally raised . This may seem a bit theoretical , but is reasonable . If this has occurred , a large percentage of animals have a genetic potential for prolificness close to the optimum . This means there is relatively little genetic variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How to Make Heritability Higher A livestock or poultry breeder wants selection to be effective so he can make rapid improvement . He can increase rate of improvement by raising heritability ? eliminating all possible environmental variations so that differences in performance or traits of prospective breeding animals will be primarily hereditary . Selection within herds or flocks , where all prospective breeding animals receive the same feed , housing , and care , takes advantage of this phenomena . But when the task is the purchase of a sire from one of several breeders , in different areas , using different feeding programs , with varying facilities , and where other unknown variations exist , it is almost impossible to know whether the differences noted among animals are due primarily to inheritance or to environment . A relatively effective solution has been the development of swine , beef , and sheep testing stations ( see Figure 14-4 ) . In these stations , all pens and facilities are identical . All animals are fed the same rations , from standard beginning weights . Every effort is made to minimize environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners ) can be relatively sure that the animals performing the best in certain traits have the most good genes for these traits and can transmit them to their offspring . Where it is not possible to bring prospective breeding animals to a central testing station efforts are sometimes made to standardize environment among farms where they are raised . All breeders in a specific program might agree to a standard feeding trial . They would all use similar rations , start animals on feed at the same age or weight , conclude the test at the same age or weight , and make the same kinds of measurements and observations . Some environmental variations still exist , but they are reduced and more of the variation in performance is due to heredity , so effectiveness of selection is irnnnnvetl ' a ) nleWhat.  | In dairy cattle it is common to mathematically adjust production for certain environmental variations known to have influence . Age at calving , season of calving , times milked per day , length of lactation , and other factors affect production to varying degrees . Detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since these factors are " environmental " factors , minimizing their effects on records by mathematical adjustments makes heritability higher and selection for production more effective . Because selection of parent stock in the poultry industry is done primarily within a particular company , environmental influences are more easily and routinely minimized . The foundation breeder will compare sire candidates within a single building , on a standard ration , and under a single caretaker . Also , because a single mating can produce many closely related birds ( full brothers and sisters ) , and because production of breeding stock is concentrated in a small number of companies , emphasis is on breeding " lines " rather than on individuals to fill the sire and dam roles in poultry improvement .  | Four rules for effective improvement of livestock and poultry by selection were given in Section 14.6 . Rule Number 3 was : Observe or measure accurately the traits carried by a prospective breeding animal . This chapter includes how the important traits can be appraised , with the eye and by means of certain measuring techniques . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others can not ( Figure 16-1 ) . While reading Chapter 16 keep in mind an important point emphasized in the previous chapter ? if environment is uniform , phenotype will be a better indicator of genotype and heritability of traits will be higher . In other words , if all prospective breeding animals are fed and handled as nearly alike as possible , it will be easier to identify the animal or animals with the best traits . Both the eye and measuring techniques can be more effectively and accurately used for selecting the best herd or flock replacements . Though some of the points discussed in this chapter are also applicable to poultry and dairy cattle , most emphasis is on swine , beef cattle , and sheep . Chapter 29 is devoted to appraisal of dairy cattle for milk production . Sources of poultry breeding stock are discussed in Sections 32.1 and 34.5. 16.1 The Traits Desired Health is obviously a primary consideration in selection of breeding animals . Poor health , whether resulting from injury , contagious disease , or malnutrition , will impair productive and reproductive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certified to he free of reproductive diseases .  | Figure These diseases can be spread very rapidly , especially when animals are bred by natural service . Any addition to a flock or herd should be prolific . Females should come in heat regularly , shed sufficient number of ova , and settle quickly . Bulls , boars , and rams should be masculine and aggressive . They should produce a sufficient volume of semen with a high concentration of normal , healthy , long-living sperm . In most cases a potentially long life is important . After a ewe reaches two years of age , she is of little value for slaughter . ( Compare current prices of fat lambs and mature ewes for slaughter . ) Yet , considerable investment has been made to grow her to breeding age . For maximum profit to the flock owner , then , she must produce a large number of lambs before she dies . Ten-year-old ewes are not uncommon in well-managed midwestern flocks . I n range flocks , few ewes are kept after they reach seven or eight years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heifers are usually two to three years of age before they calve the first time . Since the slaughter value of a mature animal is lower and the expense of raising the heifer to breeding age is large , cost per calf is tremendous if the heifer produces only three or four calves during her lifetime . In swine , longevity is not so important . Gilts usually farrow first at about one year of age and again at 18 months . The relative cost of raising the gilt to breeding age is less because she is sexually mature earlier . Secondly , she produces litters ? usually seven or more offspring ? rather than singles or twins . A third important factor is that the value of the carcass from a twoyear-old gilt ( most are sold for slaughter after weaning the second litter ) is little less , per pound , than the value of a carcass from a six-month-old gilt . Ifficient growth is important . Feed represents 60 to 90 percent of the cost in livestock enterprises . Animals that utilize feed more efficiently are more profitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rancher the  | product may be feeder lambs or feeder calves ? though the ultimate product for all meat animals is a carcass . Because many aspects of carcass quality are so highly inherited ( Table 15-1 ) a breeder should select sires or dams that would themselves yield high quality carcasses . Well-muscled animals with a high proportion of high-priced cuts should be selected . A detailed discussion of desirable carcass traits is given in Chapter 23 . Wool is an important product for the sheep raiser . Amount and quality of wool are largely determined by heredity . Which of the above traits is most important ? The trait which will contribute most to long-term profit is most important , but that trait may not be the same for all situations . Here is why . 1 . Traits desired in a sire may be influenced by traits already present in the female herd or flock . A farmer with sows that are prolific , lean , and meaty , but which gain slowly , would probably emphasize growth rate when selecting a boar . 2 . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as in its offspring . Prolificness , longevity , and feed efficiency are examples . Other traits need to be demonstrated only in the offspring ? rate of gain , carcass quality , etc. 3 . For traits where demonstration of the characteristic in the offspring is important , heritability of the trait should be considered . If the trait is not inherited and influenced solely by environment ( and its demonstration in the animal being selected does not contribute directly to profit ) then it is not an important trait to consider in selection . If , however , the trait is highly inherited , it would be very important in potential breeding animals . 4 . How many offspring will the selected breeding animal have ? A selected heifer , ewe , or gilt transmits genes to relatively few offspring in her lifetime . A bull , ram , or boar , however , may sire hundreds or thousands of offspring . This does n't influence which trait is most important , but it does influence how much more important a trait , desired and carried by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Much improvement in the livestock herds and flocks of the world has been accomplished in past centuries by visual selection of superior breeding animals . Visual appraisal has been supplemented considerably , however , by accurate observation of performing ability . Skilled and experienced livestock raisers are very observing and they have a good memory . A good beef herd owner remembers the heifer or cow that does not settle  | quickly or produces a light , weak calf . He makes it a point to cull her and not save her offspring for the breeding herd . A hog man will note the gilt that grows faster than the rest because she may " stand out , " and he will keep her for the herd . A sheep rancher will tend to save the lambs which grow and mature faster , and that are from a ewe that produces a dense , heavy fleece of high quality wool . Successful livestock raisers , who have improved their herds and flocks by selection , realize that it takes much experience , practice , and training to make accurate visual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A breeder who looks at four different boars on four different farms must be able to visualize the animals if he wishes to base his decision , in part , on type and conformation . The eye can be very accurate and precise in appraising certain traits . Table 16-1 lists some of the traits that are considered in appraising breeding stock , roughly grouped according to the ability of the human eye to appraise them accurately . Table 16.2 Traits Accurately Observed A few traits can be appraised by the naked eye with almost perfect accuracy and repeatability . Color , presence or absence of horns , number of teats , and a few others are such traits . They are either " there " or not . They look the same in the morning or evening ? today or tomorrow . They look the same to you as to me . Few mistakes can be made when selecting for these traits , unless the breeder is color-blind or can not count . Of course , accurate appraisal of the trait as it exists does n't always disclose the complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horns , as illustrated in Chapter 14 , or a black cow may carry the gene for red color .  | 16.3 Traits Less Accurately Observed Many of the traits listed in the middle section of Table 16-1 are relatively " subjective . " A boar may look older to one person than to another . Appraisal of conformation points ? width , depth , straightness of legs , etc. ? may vary depending on what the appraiser considers to be " ideal . " The attitude of the appraiser may influence his evaluation of an animal . He may rate it low if he is irritated and in a critical mood . Quality of the entire crop of lambs and degree of uniformity may influence the breeder 's evaluation of top ewes being considered for replacements . If the good lambs are surrounded by narrow , light lambs , the good ones will appear excellent . If , however , the crop is relatively uniform , the breeder may feel the good ewes are " just above average . " An animal that has been ill or poorly fed will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though it may have more desirable basic conformation ? width , straightness of legs , muscling , etc . The fact that most who show breeding animals in competition usually have them in high condition ( very fat , often much too fat for breeding ) is sufficient evidence that condition influences visual appraisal . A nervous and unruly heifer , in a group being sorted to yield replacements , will often be discounted more than the nervousness exhibited would warrant . The above illustrations merely point out that traits which can not be objectively counted or appraised do not look the same to all people , on successive days , or under varying circumstances . But experienced and observing livestock raisers use certain clues to improve their accuracy in appraising subjective traits . Age can be closely estimated by looking at the teeth ( Figure 16-2 ) . Animals within a species tend to lose their temporary incisors at rather uniform ages , usually varying less than three months . Age can also be estimated , by an experienced livestock raiser , by noting the size of head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legs . Remember that the skeleton has priority over lean and fat tissue in receiving nutrients for growth , so it tends to grow at a rather consistent and uniform rate . A breeder may starve a gilt so she will appear lean at 200 pounds , implying that she is genetically lean . A careful buyer , however , will note the longer tail , legs , and head , and perhaps suspect that she is light for her age . He then deduces that she either " did very poorly " or was purposely underfed . There are several important traits in sheep which can be rather accurately appraised by the eye of an experienced and skilled sheep raiser . Wool density and length , which influence amount of wool produced per year , and wool quality ( see Section 27.2 ) can be compared among animals being considered for the flock . Amount of wool covering the face is also apparent . These particular traits are also rather high in heritability ( Table 15-1 ) . Appearance  | is a good indicator of genotype so if animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traits to their lambs . Accuracy of estimating " weight for age " ( rate of gain ) obviously depends on the ability to estimate age and weight . Experience is essential in developing the ability to estimate either . Men who weigh livestock daily can become experts at estimating weight . Animals that will be in a herd or flock for many years ? females that will carry the load of pregnancy many times and sires that will breed often for many years ? need straight , strong , and well-placed legs and feet . A straight leg will support more than one which slants , and for a longer time . There will be less strain on the joints . If legs are placed " out on the corners , " less of the body hangs over to create leverage . Extremely straight or extremely crooked legs are distinguished by anyone , but those between sometimes vary in appearance . Straightness of legs may be influenced by the current weight of the animal and whether it is standing on soil , bedding , or concrete . Also , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always agree with himself on successive days , as to the relative straightness of an animal 's legs . Breeders of cattle and sheep prefer an animal with a straight topline . A sagging or " weak " topline is considered undesirable , probably because such an animal may be subjected to more stress by the weight of pregnancy and therefore may not produce for as many years . Some feel a straight topline indicates a large eye muscle ( longissimus dorsi ) along the backbone , but no evidence to support this opinion is available . In hogs , a slightly arched topline is preferred by some breeders . This is apparently based on the geometric principle employed when arched rafters are used to support a roof over a large open area . Note that the pig is longer between the front and hind legs , in relation to overall size , than cattle or sheep . So the extra strength supplied by an arch of the backbone may be important . Meatiness , the most important trait from the standpoint of carcass quality of offspring , is discussed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarly in breeding animals by noting width of shoulders , bulginess of muscles , and thickness of ham , round , or leg . An animal can show good muscling even when it carries little finish . In fact , too much finish often fills in the slack spots and disguises the degree of muscling . The tendency to fatten is a trait that is often difficult to appraise . This is apparently one of the reasons breeding cattle and sheep are often kept rather fat for showing in competition ? to prove to the judge that they carry the ability to fatten . Breeding efficiency of some potentially good sires and dams is actually impaired by such overfeeding . In recent years some breeders , who must make their profits from high reproduction efficiency , have refused to show such breeding stock in competition . Most breeders prefer animals that have a spacious thoracic cavity , giving  | plenty of room for the heart , lungs , and other organs to operate . Hence , they look for animals with a wide chest and with the ribs wide apart ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of teats is easily determined by counting , but location and prominence is a relative thing . Teats should be far enough apart and large enough so a calf or pig or lamb can nurse without difficulty . Size and prominence of teats are highly inherited , so should be noted when appraising breeding stock , both female and male . Inverted nipples , which are difficult to suckle , are rather common in hogs . The head ? its shape and conformation ? is used by some as a major indicator of merit in breeding animals . It is logical that a wide , blocky ewe or heifer should also have a head of the same relative shape ? wide at the poll , between the eyes , and at the muzzle . Therefore the head does often serve as a fair indicator of conformation . But why spend time evaluating the head when the body is available to see ? Appraisal of the head should serve merely to support impressions of body type and conformation . The upper and lower jaw should mesh , so the animal can graze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not uncommon in cattle and sheep . 16.4 Traits Observed with Poor Accuracy Note that the traits listed in the lower section of Table 16-1 ? prolificness , longevity of production , and feed efficiency ? are very important traits in a breeding herd or flock . They are the major contributors to profit or loss , success or failure and , at the same time , are the traits generally most difficult to appraise with the naked eye . It is probable that some traits mentioned in the previous section , such as straightness of legs and topline , directly or indirectly influence longevity of production . Rate of gain usually influences feed efficiency ; because faster-gaining animals use a smaller proportion of feed for maintenance , the amount of feed consumed per pound of gain is less . Some breeders attempt to appraise prolificness by the " broodiness " a female may demonstrate , though this trait is difficult even to describe . Temperament of a heifer , ewe , or gilt may affect net reproduction rate . If the dam is restless , offspring may be unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to lie on some of her pigs . But it is clear that exterior characteristics do not disclose the number of ova a ewe will shed or the concentration of sperm in a bull 's semen . The ability of an animal to secrete enzymes which will chemically digest feed , to efficiently absorb released nutrients , and to convert them to tissue are not evident to one who merely looks at the animal .  | B. SIMPLE MEASURING TECHNIQUES The inability of the human eye to accurately and precisely appraise economically important traits in prospective breeding animals at the time they would be selected indicates the need for using or developing certain measuring techniques which can aid the eye . It is significant to note that measuring devices or record systems which appraise and record the productive merit of an animal not only aid the eye , but also aid the memory . Perhaps too much credit for past livestock improvement has been given to visual appraisal . Considerable credit should be directed to the breeder 's memory of previous performance of particular animals or their relatives . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner and his family and providing enjoyment as well as income , the breeder may have had an almost perfect memory of the performance of every animal . This was , no doubt , the major basis for selection , supplemented by visual appraisal at the time decisions were made . Such a situation is less likely to be true in the latter part of the twentieth century . Herds and flocks , on the average , are larger . Hired labor is often used to care for the animals . Breeders still enjoy and have pride in their herds or flocks , but they participate in other pleasures and have a wider variety of interests . Their mind is also more concerned with evaluating other information on topics such as fertilizer , pesticides , and feed additives , which are increasingly important . All this means that less time , interest , and attention are usually devoted to being personally acquainted with the performance of every animal and that records to aid the memory are more necessary and worthwhile . The best measuring techniques or tools are the simplest ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by a breeder . A pencil ( Section 16.6 ) and a scale ( Section 16.7 ) are the basic tools for measuring and recording livestock performance . It must be kept in mind that replacement heifers and lambs are usually selected and sorted out at weaning time , so that they may be grown on pasture or harvested forage , rather than fattened with those intended for market . Gifts are usually sorted out at about 150 pounds or four months . At the time of selection , heifers , gilts , or ewe lambs have not had time to demonstrate certain characteristics which are important and which a breeder wants to consider . Obvious examples are prolificness , milking ability , and length of productive life . The breeder must therefore depend on information provided by some relative , such as dam , sister , or half-sister . The adequacy of such information , in appraising the weanling heifer , ewe lamb , or gilt , depends on the heritability of the trait and the degree of relationship between the animals concerned .  | Figure 16.5 Identification Proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record-keeping and livestock selection program . The breeder may be familiar with every animal , but lack of a positive identification system makes any record-keeping program worthless if he dies or is incapacitated . Most breed registry organizations require that an animal 's registry number be tattooed inside one ear with permanent ink . Some , especially for sheep , also provide small ear tags . Since registration numbers are usually long , most breeders also use some type of private system . Such numbering systems are also used on grade ( not purebred ) herds or flocks . A common system used in swine herds is illustrated in Figure 16-3.  | Figure For easy identification on pasture or range , large numbers can be applied with special , long-lasting paint or , on cattle and hogs , by hot-iron branding . Freeze-branding is also used on solid-colored cattle . Supercold branding irons cause new hair growth to lack pigment , so white numbers eventually appear on the red or black background . 16.6 The Pencil Write it down ! Birth dates , litter size , and number born dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later influence your selection decision , can be recorded on the spot in a small pocket notebook ( Figure 16-4 ) . Such information can be transferred later to permanent record sheets or books . Breeders benefit from records showing dates females came in heat and were bred . Late and inconsistent breeders can be detected more easily , and calving , lambing , or farrowing dates can be anticipated with more accuracy . 16.7 The Scale Birth weight is a guide to the ability of the newborn animal to withstand the stresses it will be subjected to . Animals that are heavier at birth usually gain faster . Experienced livestock raisers can estimate birth weight with considerable accuracy , but a scale weight provides precise information to use later in selection decisions .  | Weaning weight is important to livestock breeders for two reasons besides direct value of the weight . It indicates the relative milk production of the dam , especially in beef herds and sheep flocks where creep feeding is not practiced and the calf or lamb depends on milk as the major source of nutrients . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's inherent ability to gain . If management , milk supply , and other factors are similar , the animal which gains more rapidly up to weaning time will probably continue to gain more rapidly and will tend to transmit this trait to its offspring . Where hogs are raised in confinement , it is usually feasible to wean all pigs at the same age so weaning weights can be compared directly . With beef herds and sheep flocks this is not practical , so adjustment tables or charts have been developed which allow weighing at the same time many calves within a certain age range and adjusting their weights to a standard age ( Figure 16-5 ) . It is also important to adjust the weaning weight of calves or lambs for age of dam , since very young and very old cows and ewes give less milk . Single lambs may weigh as much as 10 or 11 pounds more than twins at weaning time in drier range areas where vegetation is sparse . In midwestern farm flocks , however , where feed is usually plentiful and lambs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productivity of dams is being compared to decide if some should be culled , the offspring 's weaning weight should also be adjusted for sex . Bulls will be about 15 pounds heavier than steers , and steers about 20 pounds heavier than heifers . This , too , varies among areas . Weaning weight , as a measure of the dam 's producing ability , is better than weights recorded later . After weaning , the animal 's growth is more influenced by feed supply and less by the dam 's milking ability . There is a relatively high correlation between weaning weights of calves , lambs , or pigs , and gains during subsequent periods . This is especially beneficial in sheep flocks and beef herds where breeders like to select their replacement females early and sell the remainder as feeders . Some breeders want more precise information , especially in evaluating prospective sires . Because a sire may transmit genes to hundreds of offspring in a year , it is worthwhile spending more time , money , and effort for precise appraisal of the sire 's productive merit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for use by many breeders have developed in many sections of the United States ( Section 15.6 ) . Some breeders operate their own testing units . Such units are designed to measure rate of gain and feed efficiency for a standard period of time after weaning and before breeding age . Potential sires from different farms and ranches are more fairly compared at these stations because environment is standard . Some stations operated by livestock organizations require that all animals meet certain growth , feed efficiency , and , perhaps , meatiness standards in  | order to be sold or taken home for use . Those which do not meet the standards are castrated and sold for slaughter . The scale is used to check feed consumption , and feed efficiency values can be calculated . This indicates the need for individual feeding if feed efficiency values are to pertain to a single animal . Selection for gaining ability ( and/or feed efficiency ) does not preclude selection for desirable conformation . Gaining ability and meatiness , or other conformation traits , can be improved by selection at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , less rapid progress will probably be made in one trait if some of the " selection opportunities " are being used on a second trait . Wool weights are commonly recorded by progressive sheep raisers , and used as a basis for selection , just as milk production is recorded and used by a dairyman. 16.8 Measuring Meatiness Carcass data from relatives could be used as a guide to meatiness of potential breeding animals , but is sometimes not available and is of limited value because the relatives are genetically different , to a degree , from the animal in question . Other techniques have been developed to measure directly the meatiness of animals in some species . A metal ruler ( live probe ) is used to measure backfat thickness on hogs . ' Backfat thickness as measured by the probe is highly correlated ( - .90 or higher ) with the percentage of lean in the carcass . Gilts or boars are probed at about 200 pounds . The skin is cut and the ruler inserted at three points , about two and a half inches off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruler penetrates the fat layer easily , but stops at the layer of connective tissue covering the eye muscle . If pigs are probed at some other weight , values can be adjusted to a 200-pound basis . One reason the probe is such an excellent indicator of percentage of lean is because fat thickness is measured near the middle of the eye muscle . A pig with a shallow , kidney-shaped muscle will have a thicker layer of fat at the measuring site , while one with a bulging muscle will have a thinner fat covering . The probe is not as accurate an indicator of percentage of lean in beef as it is in pork . The irregular shape of the eye muscle makes it difficult to obtain consistent measurements . An ultrasonic device ? an instrument which emits high-frequency sound waves and records the time it takes for them to bounce back from a junction between two tissues ? is also used to effectively appraise meatiness in beef Footnote  | Figure cattle , hogs , and sheep.2 The instrument was originally used as a flaw detector for metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the machine pass through tissue at speeds that vary according to density of the tissue . When they reach a junction with a different tissue , some of the Footnote  | waves bounce back . These " echoes " are displayed on a cathode ray tube and measured , to determine depth of fat or lean . Research workers at Cornell University3 have even used the machine to trace the shape of the eye muscle , with some degree of accuracy ( see also Figure 3-5 ) . Other measuring techniques can be used , but few yield nearly as much information or are as simple to use as the live probe used on hogs . Some have used large calipers to measure width of loin , shoulder , and round , or tape measures to appraise circumference of round . But these measurements are usually more difficult to make and are less valuable in estimating muscling . Where it is necessary to use carcass data on relatives to evaluate meatiness of a possible breeding animal , percentage of lean cuts and area of the loin eye cross section are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximation , not a precise measure of merit , so is of limited value . 16.9 Appraising Conformation Conformation traits , which are relatively subjective and which were discussed in Section 16.3 as being observed by the eye with less accuracy , are still important and must be appraised in prospective breeding animals with all the accuracy that can be mustered . Some breeders use a committee of two or three experienced livestock men who score conformation of heifers or ewe lambs by means of some numerical system ( Figure 16-7 ) . This can be done at weaning time , as they leave the scale . Scoring systems can provide as many quality groups as desired . A verbal description for each group is usually developed and appraisers try to " set their sights " together . A committee adds validity . Conformation scores can be averaged and committee members serve as a check on each other . One committee member may have viewed a heifer from the downhill side , so she looked too longlegged ; another may have an exceptionally strong bias against some trait , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weak topline too low in all other traits . Though longevity of production is less important in swine herds and relative meatiness can be appraised with the probe , certain conformation items are important and committee appraisal can be advantageous in gilt selection . After conformation scores are assigned and weights recorded and adjusted , a breeder will probably do the selecting " on paper . " Naturally he will have previously eliminated animals that are chronically ill , or have certain traits definitely not wanted ( such as color markings in a purebred herd or flock that will not allow registry ) . Selecting on paper prevents the breeder from influencing his decision because of personal , subjective bias . To Footnote  | some , this may seem absurd , but it happens . For example , he may hate to eliminate a particularly affectionate calf , lamb , or gilt , and really hate to keep one that is a bit independent or aggressive . 16.10 Appraising Other Traits For some reason , points of conformation have a certain esthetic value to livestock raisers . In other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topline , and features of the head often have " beauty " to the breeder far beyond their true economic importance . Other traits , though also subjective in nature , can usually be more objectively appraised . Wool quality , teat placement and prominence , size of udder , etc. , apparently have little esthetic value and breeders can scrutinize them with extreme objectivity . A breeder can check quickly to see if the teats are spaced so offspring can nurse with ease , and to see that no teats are inverted . An experienced sheep raiser becomes skilled at appraising wool quality . Samples of wool grades can be compared with the wool on the lamb . Sperm concentration in bull , ram , or boar semen can be checked by counting , with the aid of a microscope , as blood cells are counted . Other techniques are available to appraise sperm health and activity , as well as the percentage of abnormal sperm ( Figure 16-8 ) . Figure 16-7 . Committee members independently grade calves to the nearest one-third of a grade ( see Figure 16-9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indexes How can the net merit of prospective breeding animals be established ? How can the candidates for herd or flock sire or replacement female , since they vary in all traits , be fairly compared ? Indexes , which are actually a net merit score , can be calculated , considering the relative economic importance of the traits as well as their heritability ( see Section 16.1 ) . Separate indexes maybe calculated for different herds or flocks , or different years , as the relative importance of the traits may vary . The index for boars which complete the testing program at the Iowa Swine Testing Station has been calculated as follows : INDEX = 250 + ay . daily gain ( 50 ) ? feed per lb gain ( 50 ) ? probe ( 50 ) In the above index , rate of gain , feed efficiency , and backfat thickness ( probe ) are given equal emphasis . This index was developed , considering feed costs , market differential for lean vs. fat hogs , and the heritability of the various traits ( Table 15-1 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will index above 100 . A boar that gains 2.2 pounds per day , on 2.9 pounds of feed per pound of gain , and probes 1.1 inches at 200 pounds will index 160 . The index for those boars which are littermates of barrows slaughtered at the end of the test for carcass data includes a factor for percent ham and loin and the relative weight of the probe is reduced . INDEX = 117 + ay . daily gain ( 50 ) ? feed per lb gain ( 50 ) ? probe ( 40 ) + percent ham and loin ( 3 )  | Figure Obviously a different index , emphasizing leanness more , would be used if there were a larger price advantage for producing lean pork carcasses or if feed and labor were cheap enough that rate and efficiency of gain were less important . Also recognize that a breeder who already has a group of lean sows may ignore the index and base his selection mainly on growth rate and feed efficiency . Rather than using indexes , breeders may employ other techniques to  | arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save 25 of his 100 ewe lambs may first select the top half on conformation , then save only the half of these that gained faster . A breeder also might use a selection sheet like that in Figure 16-9 . Since about 40 percent of the heifers must be selected in order to maintain herd size , there is a limit to the severity of selection . 16.12 Progeny Testing Performance of offspring is considered by many to be the best indicator of the breeding merit of an animal . This is termed progeny testing . In poultry the young male can be mated to a large sample of females , and the performance of offspring ? broilers or pullets ? measured within a year . The sire , if demonstrated to be of high merit , can then be used extensively . Where artificial insemination is commonly used , permitting the potential value of an extremely superior sire to be extremely high , as in dairy cattle , it is often considered worthwhile to use progeny testing . Young bulls in an artificial insemination " stud " are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sire owner then awaits the performance records of the heifer offspring . The wait will , of course , be close to four years . In the meantime , however , semen may be collected and frozen for possible use with thousands of cows if the offspring excel . In the case of dairy cattle , a large proportion of the heifers that result from artificial insemination are in herds where DHIA records are maintained . These data , plus a record of the heifers ' sire and dam , are processed by computer and stored in a multistate cooperative program . All the records of the offspring of a particular sire can be retrieved in minutes . With increased use of artificial insemination and computer processing of performance data in other species , use of progeny testing in these species is likely to increase . C. CULLING Appraisal of breeding animals must continue , even after they have entered the herd or flock . An animal must prove to be a money-maker and must continue as such to justify its place in the herd or flock . Poultry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are not laying at a sufficiently high level . This same kind of culling can take place with livestock , where merited , and where the breeder has sufficient information to justify culling . Recognize that when heifers , ewes , or gilts are selected for breeding at a rather young age , some mistakes in selection will be made . The real productive ability is not known at that age and guides used for selecting are sometimes misleading .  | 16.13 How Soon Can You Cull ? Can a breeder cull with confidence at the end of the first season ? Is the first season 's production of a heifer , gilt , or ewe a good indication of her later production ? This depends on the trait . The approximate repeatabilities for various traits are given in Table 16-2 . Repeatability is the degree to which an animal repeats herself in productivity in successive years or seasons . Since the repeatability varies for different traits , the speed with which a breeder can cull with confidence also varies according to the trait being considered in culling . Table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how a repeatability figure of .34 for 210-day weaning weights of beef cattle was calculated . A herd of more than 300 cows at the Oklahoma Experiment Station was divided equally into two groups , based on weaning weight of their first calf ( see Figure 16-10 ) . Then the weights of all subsequent calves of each group were averaged . If the subsequent calves from the high group had averaged exactly 68 pounds heavier than the subsequent calves from the low group , repeatability would have been 1.00 . This means the breeder could have culled down to the number he wanted to keep after the first calf crop was weaned and be sure he did right . If both subsequent groups of calves had averaged the same , repeatability would be zero ; the breeder could not have culled on the basis of weaning weight of the first calf with any degree of confidence . The repeatability value of .34 tells a breeder that he can cull the extremely low heifers after one season , but he should wait until the second year for those which might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to settle at first service , tendency for heifers to calve once every 12 months , etc. , are usually hipll enough that when a heifer , ewe , or gilt does not settle the first breeding , season , she probably should be sold for slaughter . The cost of maintaining a heifer or ewe a year is too great and the chances they will conceive later  | are too poor . With multiple or continuous farrowing , gilts need n't be maintained a year , but a gilt that wo n't settle after two or three services to a fertile boar probably should be culled . Repeatabilities are generally calculated in such a way that all effects due to permanent differences among cows ( or ewes or sows ) are included . Since some of the permanent differences among females may be environmental in origin , repeatability will be as high as or higher than heritability.4 16.14 Can You Afford to Cull ? I t is apparent that an animal must be profitable in order to justify its position in a herd or flock . The previous section discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be culled with confidence . Certainly females that will not readily conceive and sires that are low in fertility should be culled immediately . But can a livestock raiser afford to cull a heifer because she is a poor milker and her calves are rather light and thin at weaning ? Can a sheep Footnote  | breeder afford to cull a ewe because she produces only singles rather than twins ? The answer to either question is probably " no . " The cost of raising the female to breeding age is so great and the salvage value of a mature ewe or heifer is low enough that it may be practical to keep such heifers and ewes in the herd or flock throughout their productive lifetime . There are obviously exceptions , such as a heifer that calves at two or two and one-half years of age and which can be sold at a time when beef prices are unusually high . As discussed in Section 16.1 , with the topic longevity , the problem is not so critical in swine where gilts reproduce earlier in life and their salvage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by selection and breeding programs is a slow and tedious process . The one major consolation is that improvement achieved by selection is permanent improvement and monetary benefits maybe realized for many later generations . Yet breeders , who are in the business of supplying seed stock to commercial producers , want to make improvement as rapidly as possible . The foundation poultry breeder who can incorporate into his lines high egg-producing capacity , or rapid gains and top meat quality in the case of broilers , will have a long list of franchise hatcheries eager to hatch and sell his lines to commercial producers . The breeder who can change the characteristic of his herd or flock most rapidly , to provide the type of breeding stock demanded by the commercial producer , will have a good market for his bulls , rams , boars , or even breeding females . When the percentage of lean in pork carcasses became so important to commercial hog raisers , the demand for " meat-type " boars soared . Those breeders who were alert to this demand and used most effective techniques for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( 1 ) have maximum genetic variation , ( 2 ) spend selection efforts on traits highly heritable , ( 3 ) observe or measure accurately the traits , and ( 4 ) use the selected animal most effectively . This chapter discusses the influence of reproduction rate on improvement speed , and also Rule 4 , ways to use the selected animal or animals most effectively . 17  | 17.1 Reproductive Cycle and Prolificness Corn and small-grain breeders are envied by livestock breeders in their attempt to improve livestock . The characteristics of a corn or small-grain population can be changed rapidly . Two parent kernels can produce 700 to 2000 offspring ( kernels ) each generation . Two crops ( generations ) can be grown in one season , by taking advantage of semitropical climates . Think how fast selected traits can be reproduced ! Assuming only one ear of corn with 800 kernels was selected for a new " line " or " strain " and that succeeding generations produced only one such ear per stalk , two years ' reproduction could result in 327,680 billion descendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection and rapid duplication of selected genes is tremendous , compared to livestock . Rapid progress can likewise be made in poultry . Pullets begin laying eggs at 20 to 22 weeks of age . Each breeding hen is capable of producing about 225 chicks per year , half of which would be females . Each rooster can sire thousands . A complete generation passes every year , or perhaps in only seven to eight months . This explains the rapid development of specialized strains of layers and broilers in the chicken industry and the equally rapid use of these strains to replace traditional breeds . Selection can be for only the best , and when the best are found , they can be rapidly multiplied . Hogs are the most prolific of large animals on farms . Sows normally farrow first at one year of age , thereby completing one generation , and they can produce two litters per year . If the average litter size is eight pigs , this means a selected gilt will beget , on the average , four gilts and four boars at one year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . The potential offspring of a selected boar might also be calculated . Two years after a boar is selected , assuming normal use and natural service , he might have from several hundred to several thousand offspring available for breeding . But remember half are boars and half are gilts , whereas in corn every kernel can be both a male and female " parent . " Sheep usually do not lamb until two years of age , and twins generally occur less than 50 percent of the time , even in well-managed flocks . So a ewe selected now will not have much effect on average quality for several generations , or many years . How about cattle ? Most heifers calve at two to three years of age and the calf crop is usually under 100 percent . Though two to three years might be considered the theoretical generation time , five years is more realistic as an average , because of some nonbreeders or abortions and because some of the calves are not born until the cow is four , five , or even ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively very slow . Though reproductive rate is a bottleneck in livestock improvement , it is obvious that much improvement has been made over the past century , and a number of recent developments may speed improvements by increasing  | 17.2 Predicting Rate of Improvement High heritability of selected traits , maximum " reach , " and accurate appraisal of prospective breeding animals all contribute to rapid improvement . The effects of heritability on the speed of improvements by selection were discussed in Sections 15.4 and 15.5 . Reach , which is the difference between animals selected to be parents and the average of that generation , can be greatest if there is much variation within the herd or flock ( Section 14.7 ) and if the animals are selected with care and accuracy ( Chapter 16 ) . Rate of improvement per generation can be predicted with reasonable accuracy by simple calculations . After breeding animals have been selected with the greatest accuracy and objectivity possible , multiply the heritability of the trait times the reach . Figure 17-1 provides several hypothetical examples . Heritability values were taken from Table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple and direct because the traits , weaning weight of beef cattle and backfat thickness of Figure  | pigs , are observed directly in the potential breeding animals . Averages have , of course , been adjusted for sex , age of dam , or other environmental factors ( Section 16.7 ) and selected males were counted as heavily as selected females in calculation of the averages . Remember that bulls or boars transmit half the genes to the offspring . If selection of only females were made in Examples A and B , and they were mated to their own sire , reach would be half as great and so would expected improvement . In dairy herds all cows are bred and should calve , but only certain heifer calves are saved for the herd . Those cows that are selected to be parents of herd replacements ( Example C ) need not be designated , in most cases , until they have completed at least one lactation . The breeding value of the bull that sires a replacement heifer must , of course , be estimated ( from production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the sires of the replacement heifers , as well as the dams , in Example C averaged 2,000 pounds higher in " breeding value " than the herd average , then the reach given is correct . This is certainly feasible where artificial insemination is used and perhaps in some other large herds where several bulls , ranging considerably in breeding value , are used . In herds where only one bull is used , however , selection is made only on the basis of the dam 's production and reach would be half as great . The replacement heifers get only half their genes from the selected dams . To calculate expected improvement per year , divide the product of the previous calculations by the number of years which elapse per generation . Livestock breeders also must realize that the improvement achieved by effective selection , as illustrated in Figure 17-1 , does not cause a corresponding improvement in total herd or flock average . The dams of animals not saved for breeding are still in the herd or flock , with unchanged genetic merit , and contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may produce at the 9,000-pound rate ( below herd average in Example C , Figure 17-1 ) so her heifer calves are not saved for replacements . But she remains . This emphasizes the fact that average generation interval in sheep flocks and cow herds is considerably longer than the time it takes for an animal to produce one lamb or one calf . These examples of predicting improvement rate are given only to show that it can be done . Remember that certain circumstances can , in effect , change heritability and slow or speed up improvement . 17.3 Successful Improvement Livestock populations have changed in their characteristics . Examples in hogs are more easily found because ( I ) changes can he more rapid , as previously discussed and ( 2 ) goals have changed , several times in some coun-  | In early U.S. history , salted jowl , fatback , etc. were easily preserved , high-energy foods needed by a laboring people . Pork fat was used for soap , candle , and munitions manufacture . Such markets for pork fat no longer exist and people want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident among pigs entered in the Iowa Swine Testing Station during successive years after it was first used in the spring of 1956 . Fall data are separated from spring data for several reasons . Pigs entering the station in the fall have produced leaner carcasses . This may be because the stress of winter slowed gains considerably . Feed efficiency is also lower for the winter-fed pigs . Table  | Note improvement in leanness " within season " has been large , as indicated by lower probe values , less backfat , higher percentage of ham and loin , and larger loin eye area . This change does not necessarily mean that the total hog population of Iowa , or even of the breeders involved , has changed so rapidly . Though the station has permitted identification of muscular boars that have been effectively used to improve leanness in many herds , some of the increased leanness seen in hogs at the station , especially in earlier years , was probably due to improved ability of breeders to choose lean pigs to bring to the station for testing . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In later years , especially from 1959 through 1966 , rate of gain probably received more emphasis in the breeders ' selection of testing-station entries . Considerable improvement in leanness had been achieved and probably the breeders were more able , with the aid of on-farm records , to identify pigs that were lean and had rapid gaining ability . Improvement of beef cattle or sheep by selection is more difficult to demonstrate because of the tremendous seasonal effect on performance . Hogs are usually fed a concentrated ration in drylot so environment does not vary too much from season to season . But weaning weights , type score , and other traits of cattle and lambs are greatly influenced by rainfall , which controls pasture growth . How rapidly can improvement in breeding stock be reflected in quality of carcasses sold by commercial feeders ? Table 17-2 illustrates both improvement and decline in carcass quality that resulted when boars were chosen on the basis of high or low scores of their littermates in feeding and carcass tests on two Eastern Canadian experimental farms . A " high " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test , then mated to random sows . " High " and " low " boar offspring were then successively selected to sire subsequent generations . Note the drastic spread in carcass merit . Changes in egg production and growth rate in poultry can be relatively rapid , because of ( 1 ) high heritabilities ? 35 percent or higher , ( 2 ) the large number of offspring per bird , permitting more rigid selection , and ( 3 ) the fact that birds are hatched in an incubator and usually reared in a closed building with a relatively high degree of environmental control so inherited  | traits are not significantly masked by maternal effects or other environmental factors . Research at the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center has shown changes in turkeys as a result of selection for growth or egg production . Because there can be a " year " effect , a nonselected control flock was maintained through the total experiment and data in Table 17-3 are from the control and selected flocks the last year . In the flock selected for growth , 14 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents for the next generation ; for egg production , 17 to 38 percent of the dams were selected as parents . Note that egg production , however , more than doubled in five generations . Growth rate , as the result of selection , increased about 26 percent in four generations . Why the more rapid progress in egg production than in growth ? Data in Table 17-3 suggest a sharp decrease in broodiness ( periods of time with no eggs laid ) as the result of selection . In other words , in turkeys broodiness is a big factor in limiting egg production . The selected birds also came into production slightly earlier . 17.4 Efficiency of Natural Service Most emphasis is placed on sire selection in livestock improvement programs because a selected sire can produce many more offspring than a selected  | cow , ewe , or gilt . Also , and for this reason , the sire selected can be higher on the scale of merit than the average of the female replacements that must be saved each generation ( Figure 17-2 ) . In commercial flocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year must be saved , just to maintain flock size . Should rams be saved from that flock or a different flock of the same general quality , less than 10 percent of the rams need be saved . A similar story is true for cattle or hogs . Various guides are printed for the number of sows that should be bred by one boar , cows by one bull , and ewes by one ram ( Table 17-4 ) . Such guides may be used , though they do not fit all circumstances . Effectiveness of a bull , ram , or boar depends on his age , size , inherited sexual instincts , sperm production and motility , season , and whether the herd or flock is on pasture or animals in heat are routinely sorted out and put in a breeding pen . Chapters 11 and 13 discussed some of these influences . A topnotch sire can be used on more females if those in heat are placed in a breeding pen with the sire for service , than if the sire runs with the entire herd or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the increased use of a high quality sire , rather than the additional use of a " second place " male , might be worth the effort . Such practice also facilitates recording of breeding dates so lambing , farrowing , or calving time might he more accurately anticipated .  | An ejaculate of semen from a boar , ram , or bull usually contains over a billion sperm , from a rooster several million , most of which are capable of fertilization at the time of ejaculation . At conception only one sperm unites with each ovum that is to be fertilized , so obviously there is much waste of sperm in natural service . Good sires are not used most efficiently . Semen collected for artificial insemination is usually diluted and relatively small quantities are used for insemination , so that a single ejaculate might be used to breed many females . The number of females that can be bred varies , depending on semen volume , sperm number and motility , and species , but approximate numbers are six for hogs , 10 to 20 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Current research is directed toward further dilution of semen and maintenance of sperm health so that more females might be inseminated per ejaculate . Since semen collections can usually be taken daily , and in some cases twice daily , the number of potential offspring from a top-notch sire is astronomical with artificial insemination . And it allows us to reach still further , on the sire 's side , each generation in our quest for improved livestock and poultry ( Figure 17-3 ) . The illustration in Figure 17-3 is a theoretical example , but it illustrates that artificial insemination does allow more rapid progress in livestock and poultry improvement . Control of the estrus cycle is encouraging increased use of artificial insemination , especially in range cow herds . In addition to faster improvement , ranchers have feed for more cows , since fewer bulls are kept . Dairy herd owners first used artificial breeding on a large scale in the United States , primarily because their confinement provides ease of detecting cows in heat and of inseminating . The percentage of dairy cows bred by artificial insemination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early 1950s to over 50 percent in the late 1960s . Semen can be frozen and stored for months , so the merits of an excellent sire can be " banked " and used even after his death . Frozen semen is routinely  | Figure shipped long distances , allowing several herd or flock owners to share a bull , boar , ram , or rooster. 17.6 Embryo Transplanting and Multiple Ovulation The genetic merit of top quality females in livestock herds and flocks may also be used more efficiently . A cow normally spends three months nursing a previous calf and preparing for the next pregnancy , and the other nine months pregnant . Is this necessary ? An excellent cow , ewe , or sow may be allowed to produce more ova during her lifetime by hormone-induced multiple ovulation ( Section 13.10 ) . Also , after release of the ova , the female may be bred , and zygotes later removed and transplanted to other females which would serve as hosts during pregnancy . Much research in farm livestock has been directed toward making this technique practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made in sheep , cattle , and rabbits . There are so many problems associated with this procedure , however , that little application of the technique on farms is predicted in the near future .  | Poultry improvement has for years been based on the " principle " of embryo transplanting . Eggs are not hatched by the hen but rather by an incubator. 17.7 Crossbreeding Programs Crossbreeding as a system of breeding is discussed thoroughly in Section 18.4 , but is also mentioned here because it helps speed livestock improvement in some cases . It is another of the techniques breeders employ to make the greatest and most effective use of selected breeding stock . The effect ? heterosis ( Section 18.5 ) ? is temporary and apparently exists only in the first generation of offspring . It is not a trait that is transmitted to subsequent generations . The benefit is more noticeable in traits associated with general health , prolificness , and livability of offspring .
