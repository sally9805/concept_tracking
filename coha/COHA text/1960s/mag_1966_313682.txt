THE STATES <P> Within hours of each other last week , the Governors of California and Nevada signed bills imposing fines of as much as $1,000 and sentences of up to one year behind bars for possession of the hallucinogenic drug LSD . This week a similar measure is expected to become law in New Jersey . In the weird light of LSD 's often nightmarish effects , it might seem that such a crackdown would be widely applauded . On the contrary , U.S. legislators and drug experts are actually engaged in a strenuous debate over the degree and kind of controls that should be imposed on LSD . <P> Dr. Timothy Leary , the ex-Harvard psychologist and psychedelic messiah , contends that the drug has " consciousness-expanding " qualities which stimulate " a religious response that is only understandable in terms of mysticism " ; he believes that it should be available " for all . " Other enthusiasts argue that laws banning possession of LSD would , under present circumstances , be as unenforceable as Prohibition . Though brewing the stuff is delicate and complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major , it can be concocted in any laboratory containing sufficient equipment . In New York State , which for a year has had a statute making possession of LSD a jail offense , getting the drug is as easy as it once was to buy a quart of bathtub gin . <P> " Be Cool , Baby . " In Manhattan last week , one prospective purchaser , after approaching only four likely-looking types in Washington Square and handing over a few dollars , had a sugar cube laced with LSD . The person he bought it from had never even seen him before . Explained the buyer : " It 's simple . All you do is go up to a hip-looking type and ask , ' Where can I get a cube ? ' More often than not , the guy knows , and if you do n't look like a cop , will tell you . The usual advice from the seller is ' Be cool with this , baby . ' " <P> Sharing the view that private possession of LSD should not be outlawed per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. James L. Goddard . In testimony before a Senate subcommittee , Goddard figured that an LSD ban " would automatically place maybe 10% of college students in the category of criminals " and would drive users under ground , making it more difficult to find and treat those who suffer dangerously psychotic effects . Goddard argued that present federal laws are sufficient to control the commercial manufacture and sale of LSD-the only legal supplier of which at present is the National Institute of Mental Health . And he vowed to take steps to dry up sources of lysergic acid , the basic ingredient from which LSD is made , and which is itself far more complicated to produce . Domestic production of lysergic acid is now strictly regulated , and the Government plans to stem imports .
