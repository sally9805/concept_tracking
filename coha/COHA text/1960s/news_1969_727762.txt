txt WASHINGTON ? President Nixon 's leisurely approach to his promised " era of negotiation " with the Communists has the world puzzled , but an explanation now is being advanced by informed officials . One factor , in addition to the delays occasioned by policy reviews , is a tactic as old as negotiation itself ? playing " hard to get . " But a higher strategy is involved . The main reason Mr. Nixon goes slow , these sources say , is that he wants to go far , farther paradoxically than some of his critics  --  and advisers  --  feel is feasible . The State Department , for example , believes a strategic arms agreement with the- Russians is within reach . But Mr. Nixon has made it clear that he wants Moscow 's help first in making progress toward political settlements in the Middle East , Southeast Asia and Berlin  --  settlements many Sovietologists believe will be slow in coming . Counsel Against Risk The State Department 's counsel to Mr. Nixon is not to risk a bird in the hand for three in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposal of his professional advisers , including former Ambassador to Moscow Llewellyn Thompson , to set a date now for the . opening next summer of strategic arms limitation talks with Moscow . Otherwise , an impending new round in the nuclear missile race could pass the point of no return . That view parallels one expressed recently by former Defense Secretary Clark Clifford , who said : " We may never again expect to be in as favorable a position as we now enjoy for entry into talks about a freeze in strategic nuclear armaments . The Soviet Union continues to produce and perfect its nuclear missiles . Technological developments may well make any arms limitation agreement more difficult to develop and enforce a year from now , or six months from now , than it is today . " Nixon 's Larger Aim President Nixon , while acknowledging these risks and difficulties , has taken a different view thus far . He is after bigger stakes than a missilecurb pact and is not only delaying talks but continuing the nuclear missile race . Mr. Nixon 's great gamble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " profound transformation " of Soviet-American relations . " If the Middle East , Vietnam and Berlin can be eliminated as tension paints , the danger of nuclear war would be lifted from the world , " an Administration source asserts . " No other forseeable Soviet-American divergence would be likely to precipitate a nuclear confrontation  --  any more than did the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia or the American landing in the Dominican Republic . " Is the concept of a profound change in Soviet-American relations really feasible ? Or is it a Walter Mitty dream ? " The President believed when he took office that a turning point might be at hand , " the Administration source declares . " But then it was only a hope , a hypothesis . Now there is evidence that this hypothesis may be right . " Undoubtedly , eased tension with the West commends itself to Moscow at a time of armed clashes with China , strains in Eastern Europe and even stronger pressures than usual ? now that a new Five Year Plan is being drafted  --  to divert economic resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been helpful in the Vietnam peace talks . Moscow was forthcoming in its Dec. 30 Mideast peace proposals , and restrained in February 's Berlin crisis . On the basis of numerous recent Soviet diplomatic contacts , the White House asserts that Moscow does not object to the idea of simultaneous negotiation on a broad range of issues . Both sides undoubtedly see in these issues the agenda for a summit conference , possibly next summer . But Mr. Nixon 's insistence that " simultaneous negotiation " means " missile talks last " still elicits criticism in the Soviet press . Next Round ' Under Way Meanwhile , the dangerous " next round " in the nuclear arms race is rapidly getting tinder way  --  and not only in defensive antiballistic missiles ( ABM ) . On Feb. 3 the first of 31 Polaris submarines went into drydock to be modified for larger offensive Poseidon . missiles carrying MIRV multiple warheads . The conversion ? cost , including missiles , almost equals the original submarine 's purchase price . Funds for converting ten submarines will beon hand if the budget nowbefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of independentl$T. targeted warheads in the Polaris . fleet  --  from 656 to more than ' 5,000 . The Old and the New The Johnson Administration , which initiated both the ABU and MIRV programs , pressed ' simultaneously for missile ta:llts : that would halt them . President Nixon , by delaying the missile ; talks , has conveyed the impression that he is prepared-to. go ahead with another round of the arms race . Defense Sec. - retary Laird has done even more along that line . . The Kremlin undoubtedly senses in this the brinkmanship. ' of the " old " Nixon . Yet it also : sees before it the " new " Nixon , olive branch in hand , offering a far-reaching accommodation " around the world  --  one reaching farther than Moscow itself may want to go . Mr. Nixon is. gambling that the Soviet Union , confronted by the choice , will choose peace , not the sword . ?
