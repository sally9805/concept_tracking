txt The three astronauts of Apollo 10 plunged back to earth yesterday , bringing to a successful end their eight-day , moon-orbiting flight and clearing the way for man 's first landing on the moon this summer . " We know we can go to the moon , " Dr. Thomas 0 . Paine . the nation 's space agency administrator , said after the splashdown . " We will go to the moon . " This was the official goahead signal for the Apollo 11 astronauts , already in training , Ito prepare for the moon-landing attempt , probably in July . Such was the can-do confidence that prevailed here after the Apollo 10 astronauts rode their cone-shaped spacecraft to a safe and accurate splashdown in the South Pacific at 12:52 P.M. , Eastern daylight time , about 440 miles east of Pagopago , American Samoa . ' Great to Be Back ' Mission officials said that " all systems worked as expected " during the 500,000-mile voyage . " It 's really great to be back from the moon , " Col. Thomas P. Stafford of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he stepped onto the redcarpeted deck of the U.S.S. Princeton . " All of us feel in great shape . " And they looked it . Colonel Stafford and Comdrs . John W. Young and Eugene A. Cernan of the Navy , dressed in their light blue flight coveralls , walked briskly and evenly from the helicopter that plucked them out of the water across the deck toward the ship 's sick bay . ' Looked Great to Me ' After a preliminary examination , the shipboard doctor said the three astronauts " looked great to me . " . Freshened by showers , a rest and dinner , the astronauts then took off from the ship in helicopters for Pagopago , where they then changed to an Air Force C-141 jet transport for the 13-hour nonstop journey l'back here for a reunion with their families later today . For the next 10 days the astronauts are to describe their mission in detail during brieflings with flight controllers , en // engineers and the crew of Apollo 11 . The Apollo 10 mission , launched May 18 , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 824-billion Apollo project . It was often referred to as the dress rehearsal for the lunar landing in that it involved all the essential steps , except the actual touchdown and liftoff from the moon . The Apollo 10 astronauts flew around the moon 31 times to scout the intended landing site on the Sea of Tranquility and to give the lunar landing vehicle its final flight checkout in maneuvers taking it down as close as nine miles over the moon 's cratered surface . This marked the first time that the lunar module had been tested around the moon , only the second time men have flown around the moon and the closest man had ever come to another celestial body . Paine Voices Confidence At a news conference here after the splashdown , Dr. Paine , the head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , declared : " Eight years ago yesterday the United States made the decision to land men on the moon and return them safely by the end of the decade . " Today , this moment , with the Apollo 10 crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go to the moon . We will go to the moon . Tom Stafford , John Young and Gene Cernan have given us the final confidence to make this bold step . " About the only question left , Dr. Paine said , was the timing of the moon-landing attempt The tentative launching date is July 16 , leading to a lunar touchdown on July 20 . " We have no false pride about these specific dates , " Dr. Paine said . " We will not hesitate to postpone this mission if we feel we are not ready in all respects . " If a July launching is found to be impossible , the mission would have to be rescheduled to at least a month later . The moon 's position in respect to earth and the lighting conditions at the primary landing sites are favorable only six days during each month . Although he raised the possibility of a delay , Dr. Paine made it clear that such a delay was not now being planned . " Today we see no obstacles In the path to the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks from today , when we have carefully reviewed the flight data and debriefed the crew of Apollo 10 , we will know whether we will be ready to set forth on July 16 . " Lieut . Gen. Samuel C. Phillips , the Apollo program director , said that he had " seen nothing so far to deter us from our July 16 launch date . " General Phillips said that preparations on the Saturn 5 rocket with the spacecraft attached on top , which was rolled to the launching pad last week , were on schedule , as was the training for the Apollo 11 crew . The crew  --  Neil A. Armstrong , a civilian and Col. Edwin E. Aldrin Jr . and Lieut . Col. Michael Collins of the Air Force  --  are now busy practicing the moon voyage manuevers in spacecraft simulators here and at Cape Kennedy , Fla . General Phillips also said at the news conference that if the Apollo 11 moon landing were successful the Apollo 12 crew would probably be launched in November toward a different site along the moon 's equator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at about 5:30 A.M. when the astronauts were awakened with a reveille bugle call radioed from mis- ' sion control here . Their spaceship was then 57,500 miles from , earth and traveling 6,150 miles an hour . The men ate breakfast , stowed loose gear and had a 6.6-second firing , of the spacecraft 's maneuvering rockets to sharpen their aim toward the splash down target . It was the only mid-course aiming correction required , during the earthward joui-ney , which began early Saturday ' morning . At 7:40 A.M. , when they were still some 43,000 miles from earth , the astronauts beamed the 19th and final color telecast of the mission . They focused first on the earth . " One reflection that we felt very strong about when we show you our last telecast here of the earth , " Colonel Stafford said , " is that we felt very strong about sharing with you some of the adventure , the excitement , the challenge that has been a reward of these eight days . " A Sharing of History " Through this endeavor , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made you and millions of people of the world more of a part of the history that 's being made in our day and age . " At 12:22 P.M. , 15 minutes before reaching the earth 's atmosphere , explosive bolts were triggered automatically to separate the command module from its long cylindrical rear compartment , called the service module . The module housed the rocket that got the astronauts into and out of lunar orbit , as well as the main supply of oxygen and the electricity generator . The command module was then on its own , running on battery power and a reserve supply of oxygen . Another automatic command from the spacecraft computer fired small maneuvering rockets to point the blunt end of the craft toward the earth at an angle . Consequently , the three astronauts were riding backward , facing the apex of the craft . The blunt end was pointed In the line of flight because it is the area of the vehicle most heavily shielded with a reinforced plastic to dissipate the high temperatures during reentry . Friction from the spacecraft knifing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer surface to about 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit . At 12:38 P.M. , the spacecraft reached the outer limits of earth 's atmosphere at an altitude of 400,000 feet . Apollo 10 was then streaking over Asia , 1,400 miles from the splashdown point . A few seconds after entering the atmosphere , the extreme heat caused communications between the Apollo 10 and the ground to black out , as expected . The astronauts were then Comdr . Eugene A. Cex-nan speeding at 24,790 miles an hour , the fastest men have ever flown . The Apollo 8 astronauts returned from the moon at a speed a few hundred miles , slower because of a slight dif- ' ference in the angle of their return trajectory . Within minutes , communications from Me spacecraft were restored , and tracking aircraft ' sighted Apollo 10 . Ground controllers assured the astronauts they were " on top of the target . " At 12:46 , the first set of two small parachutes unfurled to slow the spacecraft from 300 miles to 175 miles an hour . Air resistance had already served as a primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deployed automatically , and Apollo 10 began floating down slowly within view of the Princeton and television cameras that transmitted the final minutes before splashdown to audiences around the world . The Navy estimated that the spacecraft hit the calm waters 7,000 yards from the ship . Helicopters had no trouble finding the spacecraft and were soon dropping swimmers down to open the hatch and get the three astronauts out in a rub ber lif raft . " Tell the medical officer to take a couple of aspirins and relax , " one of the astronauts radioed to the helicopter . " We feel great . " In less than an hour , the astronauts were hoisted aboard the hovering helicopter and flown to the Princeton for the first of many welcomes back to earth . " The thing that made this possible is being part of the greatest country in the world , " Commander Cernan said after he set foot on the Princeton . " And it 's great to come back to it .
