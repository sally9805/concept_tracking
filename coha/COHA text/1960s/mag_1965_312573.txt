The muse notwithstanding , art in the Western world is a commodity . In U.S. dollars , the timely tabulation takes place in the high temple of auctioneering , Manhattan 's Parke-Bernet Galleries . When the collection of the late Wall Street stockbroker Ira Haupt went under the hammer last week , the question was : How fare the moderns ? <P> Right from the start the mood was bullish . First up were European blue chips : a Kandinsky watercolor went for $7,200 , a Salvador Dali watercolor reached an extraordinary $11,500 , and a fine 1921 Mondrian peaked at $42,000 . Then Russian-born Nicolas de Stal , who jumped out his studio window in 1955 , sent bids skyrocketing when his semi-abstraction , Fleurs , soared to $68,000 to set a new record . In all , four works by De Stal brought $152,000 . <P> The Americans were also a matter of astronomy , although Mark Tobey 's star seemed dwindling . Three Tobeys went for a total of $34,000 , or $8,500 below top estimates . But Willem de Kooning 's flowing landscape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , garnered his top auction price , an even $40,000 . And for the first time a Robert Rauschenberg was put up for bids . A 1959 " combine " ( it includes a tie and a zipper ) called Summer Storm popped right through the ceiling , to $13,000 , or nearly twice the estimated price . <P> With a total of $483,000 paid for 40 works in a scant hour , Peregrine Pollen , representative of Parke-Bernet 's new owner , Sotheby 's of London , saw nothing but blue sky ahead for U.S. modern art . " Breaking records does n't mean too awfully much , does it ? " said Pollen . " Look at the mile . It 's broken every day . "
