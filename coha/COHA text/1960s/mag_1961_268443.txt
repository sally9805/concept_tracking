Tammy Tell Me True ( Universal ) is the sort of film for which projectionists should get hazardous-duty pay . It is aimed at the 14-year-old female mind-that is , at nine-year-old girls . Such an audience is too young to know that this is a sequel to another Tammy movie , in which Debbie Reynolds frisked about in jeans and country , vowels , casting into every troubled soul a bright golden ray of digestive distress . Debbie , at 29 , can look forward to several more years of playing perky teenagers . Nevertheless , the studio has found a replacement : 19-year-old Sandra Dee , a chubby blonde with a rosebud mouth and cheeks that look just right for storing walnuts . <P> Tammy 's one true love has left her because she is an unlearned , shantyboat girl . She is all alone in the world , except for a pet nanny goat , because her grandpa is in jail for-heh , heh-moonshining . So she sets off downstream to Seminola College to learn to talk proper . She arrives just in time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women is on the outs with her artist husband who , in turn , has been deserted by his muse ; the college 's aged benefactress is beset by a greedy niece ; and John Gavin , a young speech instructor , is sitting home nights . " OOOh , " says Tammy as she sees Gavin , " he gives me a feelin ' that the warmth of the sun is soakin ' into mah innards ! " " OOOh , " says the viewer , as Tammy sets everyone 's life in order , " she gives me the feeling that a spilled jugful of hot butterscotch sauce is soaking into my shirt front !
