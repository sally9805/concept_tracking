ATOM BLASTS &; TV SETS <P> The Kara Sea , usually mantled by ice and fog , glared with the blinding light of a multimegaton explosion . Some 1,500 miles to the south , in the stony uplands above Semipalatinsk , another nuclear bomb went off in a ball of fire , thrusting a column of fallout into the upper atmosphere . Thus last week , from one end of Siberia to another , Nikita Khrushchev continued to shock the world with almost daily detonations of nuclear weapons . <P> Because of official Soviet silence , ordinary Siberians knew nothing about the explosions . They kept doggedly at their tasks of plowing virgin lands , tunneling through mountains , erecting steel mills and bridges , building new cities and rebuilding old ones . On Vladivostok , dozens of new apartment buildings climbed up the wooded hills overlooking Golden Horn Bay . The citizens of Omsk , surrounded by a treeless steppe , were paving more and more streets with asphalt in an effort to end the dust storms that have plagued them for centuries . Irkutsk swarmed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's three universities , two medical colleges and eight technical institutes . On Lake Baikal , the deepest in the world , fishermen cast their nets for the tasty omul . <P> This contrast between the bombs and a vigorous frontier existence is only the latest version of a contrast familiar to Siberia , always a land both of life and death , of vitality and horror . <P> The new Siberia-rarely visited , even more rarely photographed , by outsidersis-is big , brawling , self-confident . TIME herewith presents eight pages of color pictures by Photographer John Launois , who , with TIME Correspondent Don Connery , traveled across Siberia from the Sea of Japan to Moscow . <P> Snowbound Dark . Despite obvious progress , Siberia continues to evoke terror in European Russia . Moscow University graduates are plunged into despair when ordered to emigrate east of the Urals . Workers and peasants are so reluctant to settle in the virgin lands that the Soviet government must tempt them with tax exemptions , bank credits and free grain . <P> To most Russians , as to most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old days it seemed a trackless waste infested by brodyagi , branded criminals with slit noses and lashed backs who had escaped from convict prisons and lived by robbery and murder . Siberia was synonymous with space , silence , emptiness and snowbound darkness for 20 hours of every winter 's day . The grim land was said to unhinge men 's minds : bored Czarist officers in isolated forts broke the monotony by playing Russian roulette . Settlers in the barren north fell victim to " arctic hysteria . "
