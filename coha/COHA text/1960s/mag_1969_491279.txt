There were eight No SwimNt --  ; signs on the walls . Then there was a sign that said : " Goon LUCK . Gentlemen , you can he proud of your honest and faithful service to your country .

Still , he did not like his job ; it scared him . He mentioned this to his company commander one day and he was transferred to a barge . The barge carried mortars . It was pushed down the rivers by a boat and left to spend the day . The men on the barge would fire the mortars into the jungle . At the end of the day the boat would return and tow the barge hack to camp . This was better than running into the jungle , but still it was not so good . For instance , when the Viet Cong attacked . there was no place to hide , and some of the men jumped into the river . Jerry Spitzer could not remember anyone who had jumped into the river and not drowned . He spent seven months on the barge . He became a corporal . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ma , me and President Johnson , we just do n't think alike . I guess .

He had never heard of the hungry i either , but when he had gotten into the cab , late that cloudy afternoon , after finally having escaped from the out-processing center at Oakland , Jerry Spitzer had asked the driver for a good place to kill five hours waiting for a plane . The driver . who was . without imagination , took him to the hungry i . And there Jerry Spitzer was sitting , as summer twilight came to San Francisco . at an empty bar in a dim . red room , with album covers on the walls and a girl who drew caricatures ( $3 black and white ; $6 color ) sitting at a table in the back , filing her nails . " Almost did n't come home . " Jerry Spitzer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got married . " He grinned beneath an unsuccessful moustache . " To a Vietnamese girl . " He reached for his wallet . The picture . of the two of them . had been taken from a distance and was not very clear . " What 's her name ? " " Nga . " " What 's the rest of it ? " " I do n't know . It was some funny first name . I ca n't remember . " He was going to marry her . " The only foreign girl I never touched . " But when he asked the Army if he could stay in Vietnam long enough to do it , they told him it was too late . He would have to go home as scheduled . " When did you ask them ? " " The day before . " " The day before what ? " " The day before I was supposed to come home . " So Jerry Spitzer , 20 years old , thin , with a face that still had pimples on the chin . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheese , went to Saigon . as scheduled , and spent his final hours in Vietnam searching for a Vietnamese-English dictionary that would enable him to write to Nga and explain why they could not get married . He did not find one . " Say , what 's that lady doin ' ? Is she drawin ' one a them characters ? " She was : for a banker in a gray suit and his date . Continued on page 50 22 CAME HOWL n.

You know , kind a somethin ' to bring home . " The woman was finished with the hanker and his date . She showed them what she had done . They laughed . the hanker paid her , and they went hack to the bar . Jerry Spitzer lit a cigarette , coughed deep and hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightened the jacket of his uniform and walked to the hack of the room . " Ma'am . I 'd like you to draw me one a those . " She motioned him into the chair . The sign that gave the prices said her name was Karen LeVine . She had dark hair and a lot of makeup and she was a little heavy from sitting in chairs too much . " Are you Canadian ? " " Pardon ma'am ? " " Are you Canadian ? Is that a Canadian uniform ? " " No ma'am . It 's American . It 's an American Army uniform . " " It 's not the usual American uniform , is it ? It looks different . " " There 's two kinds a uniforms in the Army , ma'am . There 's the khaki and the green . This is the green . They give you one new when you get back from Vietnam and you 're gettin ' out . " " Have you just come back from Vietnam ? " " Last night . And I got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mot-C. - " 1 see . " She worked quickly , with big sweeping strokes of a charcoal pencil . She drew a profile , making his nose enormous . Then she drew lines to indicate that his head was spinning to the right , and in the right corner she drew a cartoon blonde . At the top she wrote a caption : " I knew there was something to come home for . " She tore it off the pad and gave it to him . He handed her three dollars and stared at the picture . The way she had drawn his uniform and the way she had his head spinning made him look like a waiter slipping on a grease spot in a cheap restaurant . He had come home from a war , and the first thing that had happened to him in thecountry that had sent him to light was that he paid three bucks for a cartoon that really said go away little boy and do n't think we 're impressed with that uniform . " What 's your position on the war ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sentiments on the war ? Do you think we have any right to be there ? " " I do n't know , ma'am .

" He looked at the picture she had drawn of Jerry Spitzer . " Karen , this man did n't start the war . He was sent there by his country and he went and he did what he was told to do . And now he 's come home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , l want you to think about what it means . And then I want you to put down what it means on another piece of paper . i want you to draw a new picture of this man , getting in there what he is and what he 's done and what it means that he 's come home . Go on . I 'll pay you for it . But draw something decent this time . " " I do n't think I can . l mean I 'm so opposed to this war , I just do n't think I can . " " Sure you can , Karen . You 're just afraid to . " She looked across the table at Jerry Spitzer . " Would you mind posing a few more minutes ? " " No , ma'am . " " All right . " She bent to her pencils and chalks . She made a stroke on the paper . She made another one in a different place . Then she reached up and tore the page off the pad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh paper a long time . Then she made a slow , tentative stroke . It took Karen LeVine 20 minutes to do the drawing . It was a three-quarters head and shoulders , with deep shadows in the face and strong lines and a power and sadness in the eyes . She got the uniform right this time , even down to the ribbons on his chest . It was the finest Jerry Spitzer would ever look in his life . By the time she finished , the sweat was coming out of her so fast that she had to wipe it away with a Kleenex . " Just one more minute , " she said . Jerry Spitzer nodded . He had been sitting perfectly still through it all , not even smoking . for the first time all day . Karen LeVine began to write across the bottom of the picture : " Fortunate indeed is the hero home from this war  --  alive . " Then she took the picture from the pad very gently and turned it around and held it up to show to Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move up and down and he did not say anything . " Beautiful , " the banker 's date said . " That 's it , Karen , " the hanker said . " That 's just w hat I meant . " " Thank you . ma'am , " Spitzer said , " it 's a nice drawin ' . " The hanker took a $10 hill from his wallet arid put rt on the table . " Thanks again , Karen . " He took the picture and handed it to Jerry Spitzer . " Isere . Take this one home to your mother . this is one yr.eu can hang on your wall . " limy he met Artie and Danny and Carol was unclear . But there he was , talking to them , at a table in the back of the hungry i , and the three of them , Artie with the gray hair and sideburns ; Danny , pudgy. with the big black moustache ; and the neat , clean Carol , who was Artie 's girl . listening to Jerry Spitzer talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indiana . And Artie , who was getting a doctorate at Berkeley , and Danny . who was getting a doctorate at Columbia and was in California for a summer vacation from his wife , and Carol , who taught school in New Haven , Conn. , all fell in love with Jerry Spitzer . " Listen , " Artie said . two hours later . " Stay here tonight . We can go over to Berkeley and go out for a while over there and then you can sleep at my place . " Jerry Spitzer had a midnight plane . But the beer was working in him now and he thought about what there was at home : Betty . the girl he had tried to break up with by mail ; the plant , where maybe he could get a job ; the long , flat . thin roads of mid-America ; the little jukebox bars and the hot summers and the winters when nothing moved , and the men who wore T-shirts in the factories , and his mother whose heart was weak  --  tend he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked across the table at crazy Artie with the sideburns and how come his hair was getting gray already , and Danny with that goddamn moustache . and Carol whom he could n't figure out because she did n't look like a hippie but if he ever caught Betty in one or those skirts he 'd kill her . So Jerry Spitzer , still in his new green uniform , with his caricatures under his arm , climbed into the back of Artie 's four-year-old MG , with Danny huddled next to him , and Carol in the front , and Artie drove up the high hills and down them and through the painful damp chill of the night . At intersections , when Artie would have to slow down , people would turn and stare . Jerry was standing straight up , saluting . Danny was playing a kazoo that had come from the pocket of his peacoat . It was Jerry 's motorcade and he was proud . Welcome home , Jerry , welcome home . Where were the keys to the city ? Jerry waved to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hills and down them . Home from Vietnam , Home to his grateful nation . Artie drove across the cold bridge into Berkeley . Artie lived on the side of a hill near the football stadium . There were lone flights of steps outdoors and then more inside to the third floor w here Artie had a room . Artie opened a drawer in his desk and Look out a pouch and began to roll cigarettes in brown paper . " This is good stuff , Jerry . better than what you got over there . " " I hope so . because over there that sluff did n't do nothin ' for me. - Then Artie went to his closet and took out a jug of red California wine . Sweet smoke filled the room . And music . Jerry Spitzer took off his new green uniform and folded it neatly over the edge of a chair . He put on khaki pants and a sweat shirt . He sat on the edge of a bed . The music was loud Artie rolled more cigarettes . The jug was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corner , playing bongo drums . Carol was staring out a window . She had stopped talking too . The lights of San Francisco were out there . Visible from the hill . Twinkling . And the bridge like a necklace in the darkness of night . Artie sat backward in a chair , staring at the floor . The music got louder . Jerry Spitzer sucked the smoke deep into his lungs . Three days before he had been in the jungle . He was smiling . He drank wine from the half-empty jug and smoked until the cigarette burned his lips . " All right . This is all right . " It went on for an hour . The music . Loud . Loud . An electric blanket , covering the consciousness , smothering it in sound . Artie rolled another cigarette and passed it . Jerry Spitzer , who had gone in boats down narrow rivers , weaved back and forth . " Are you high ? " Carol asked him . Her voice was very far away . Very small and soft . Jerry Spitzer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a wonderfully funny remark . Like hello , or good morning . Wonderfully funny . The room was filled with giggles . And music . " I do n't think you are high , " Carol said . " Because I 'm not . " She made two more cigarettes . She gave one to Jerry Spitzer . He smoked it very fast and let very little of the smoke get away . Carol stood up and took Artie by the hand and they left . Danny went , too . Jerry Spitzer fell back on the bed . his eyes closed , his hands moving with the music that he would never hear again . And after a while his hands stopped moving and he slept . Richmond , Indiana , was a sooty lump in the flat green land . Jerry Spitzer did not like it . He said it was too big . Population 47,500 . " What I want. - Jerry Spitzer was saying , " is a place way out on a farm somewhere where if I want to chop down a tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a horse they can have a horse and nobody bothers you about nothing . " The plane landed at 4:30 in the afternoon . Indiana summer . Dark heavy clouds blowing across the sky . Lots of sweat , The air feeling thick like the air in a laundry . There were people waiting for the plane . but none was looking for Jerry Spitzer. teheferindohrenei nnge xHpeecht d had wait THREE CAME HOME 21 ) intrudes for his stns " Goddamn this place . anyway . I .... was n't but eighi or nine hugs on I he phut ... I could tt carried them in myself . " Outside , I here were three old cabs with drivers leaning . Jerry Spitzer got in the first cab and gave his address . The driver storied into town . " First thing I got ta do is I got ta go over to Anderson and see Betty . I known her since I was eigh teen , but see , when I was over there I wrote her about this Vietnamese girl and I asked her to please send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote her again and I said , Look Betty , I ai n't kiddin ' .

Somebody buttin ' in like that where they ought to he mind-in ' their own affairs . And especially Sharon , boy , she was no one to talk . Hell , she got pregnant and had to get married . So I wrote back to her and said yes , Sharon . you are damn right . it is none of your business , but since you are going to butt in anyway let me just say that at least I did n't get Betty pregnant. - " So what happened ? " " Well , that shut Sharon up all right , but I never did get the goddamn rings back . " The cab drove slowly into Richmond . There was no feel of home to this . There had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See , my Dad was a construction worker and we moved around a lot on account a that and then he was always havin ' problems about money . My brother Joey , he 's fourteen now , but he 's had ulcers since he was nine years old because he always used to hear my Ma and my Dad fightin ' all the time about money . " I remember one time my Dad saved up all kinds of money and bought one a them new Edsels the first year they come out . and we did n't have it but a week or two when my Ma took it out and all of a sudden she shoved it into P right out there on the road . Well , that sure did mess up that car and my Dad he was real mad and kept hollerin ' about how the hell could she ever of shoved it into Park right when she was goin ' forty miles an hour , and Ma said heck she did n't know nothin'about Park  --  she thought P meant Passin ' gear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" Wait , I think it 's the first one . Pull around to the left there and go in behind . . . yeah , yeah , this first one is it . " Jerry Spitzer was home from the war . There was an auto body shop down the street . Dented pieces of chrome , some rusted , piled high . Behind the house there were railroad tracks and freight trains that moved slowly , steadily past all day , making the television picture flutter . The fare was $4.75 . Jerry Spitzer gave the driver a five-dollar bill . Then his mother was out the door . A trim , faded woman of 42 . And Joey , and Roger Palmer 's little girl , Beth , who was eight . " Where have you been ? Where have you been ? I was expecting you at nine o'clock this morning . " " You ai n't gon na believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hippies . Artie and Danny and what was that girl 's name , Carol . We stayed with them in San Francisco . " " Oh , San Francisco , When you called I thought you said St. Louis and I told Roger you were in St. Louis and he told me l was crazy that you could n't have been in St. Louis because nobody gets out of the Army in St. Louis , and if you were in St. Louis anyway you would of come right on home . I guess he was right , huh ' ? " She laughed . " They were really cool people . Ma . They believe in make love not war and all that stuff . And in just sayin ' what you fee like sayin ' and doin ' what you want to . I think I might be a hippie . That 's what I might do . " " Oh . Jerry : ' his mother said , and she laughed again , and , with their arms around each other , they walked into the house . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get home from the war . Maybe they run into the bedroom they knew as a boy and call old friends on the phone and go to parties all week long , Jerry Spitzer turned on the television . The Flintstones . A freight went by and the picture fluttered . He sat , shirtless , in a chair and stared at the screen . He had someone to call , Someone he had met in Vietnam who had married a girl from Muncie . The name was Meyers. or something like that . The guy had said give me a call when you get back and come on over and we 'll go out for a few beers . But Jerry Spitzer had not written down the name and address and now he could not find it in the phone book . " Meyers . I could a sworn he said Meyers . " He put the phone book away and picked up a comic hook . The incredible Hull , . Next year . anyway , there would be reunions . There would he a big reunion with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a place . He would have to go there in 1969 and see his buddies . One lived on Second Avenue , one lived in Brooklyn , and one lived on Long Island . " If I like it , " he was saying to his mother . -I might even get me a job and live there for a while . Live on the beach in New York . " His mother nodded . it was almost time for dinner . " What I thought we might do , Jerry , was , just to keep it simple . was send out to Kentucky Fried Chicken . And then afterward we would n't have any dishes or anything and we could call Roger at the tavern and he could pick us up and we could all go down there for a while . " Jerry Spitzer did not say anything . " Jerry ? Is that all right ? " " Yeah , sure , Ma . Anything you want to do . " And so : the homecoming dinner . Kentucky Fried Chicken . The biggest bucket they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother and his 14-year-old brother and Roger Palmer 's eight-year-old girl . Roger himself was already at the tavern . The White Horse , in Chester . three miles away . Roger spent a lot of time there , going in after work , after a day at the plant , all hot and sweaty and tired . It was a nice place to go and sit around . They called and Roger Palmer drove down to the house and picked them up . Then they all drove back to The White Horse . There was a prophylactic machine by the toilet . Dottie. whose hair was white , brought draft beer to the table . And Cokes for the boy and girl . And a Salty Dog for Roger . who was very friendly , Very glad to see Jerry . very glad that Jerry was home . He gave Jerry a lot of good advice right away . About where to buy a car . About down payments and cosigning . At d about the plant . About how the chant was the best place to work because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to do factory work . tf at 's what he has to look for . the benefits . And Jerry said Richmond was too big and he did not want to live there , but maybe he could find a small town and work in a factory there . " Well , you could do that . Yeah . you could do that , " Roger Palmer said . And then Jerry told him about Artie and Danny and Carol and what nice people they were and host he was thinking maybe of going back out to see 1hem . And Roger Palmer snorted and said . " Jesus Cuh-rist , " and he laughed . Hippies . Ha-ha-ha . And another lull when Joey talked about this great new movie : The Gree , , Berets . keys to the car , and he went outside and put a big heavy package in the trunk . Beth . the eight-year-old , came running in . " You should see what Jerry got . He got weights . He got a whole set of weights . " Joey came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me I 'd he gain ' in the Army in a few years so I 'd better start buildin ' myself up right now . He said I was n't strong enough , I was too skinny for Vietnam . " It was dark when they left the White Horse . Roger Palmer drove the crowded car fast and talked about how it was such a goddamn shame that to go back out to the airport you had to drive through " the nigger section . " The night was warm . There were mosquitoes behind the house . Jerry Spitzer carried the box of weights inside and down to the cellar . There was an electric Coca-Cola clock on a pillar in the cellar . It worked . The time was 8:42 P.M. Jerry Spitzer sat cm the floor and opened the box of weights and began to put the set together and explained to his brother Joey how the thing to do was to start out with only a little and then gradually use more and more . And his mother and Roger Palmer stood around and said yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it . When Su May first came to our Home in Hong Kong , the other children called her " Girl-who-will-notlaugh .

Every once in a while he would put his hand up to his head . His head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying . It was simple . He had been shot in the head , and people ss ho were shot in the head died . He knew that . The only thing he could think of to do was pray , so , to pass the time , he prayed . There were two other Marines also lying in the slop . That left only three front the six-man patrol to fire back into the woods where the shots were coining from . Finally , a platoon of Marines came across the rice paddy and the firing stopped coming from the woods , and then they called for a helicopter to take Mark Guzevich and the other two men away . In Danang. they operated immediately . Later a military neurosurgeon would explain it : " The bullet , as it passed through the scalp , depressed a portion of the skull , causing laceration to brain tissue underneath . The surgeons cut through the skull to remove any hone fragments and whatever bullet fragments may have penetrated the brain , and also to cut away that portion of brain tissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain called the frontal lobe . They removed a portion of the frontal lobe . " But when Mark Guzevich woke up he could think , he could talk , and he could move all the parts of his body . He was very lucky , the doctors at Danang said . A very lucky young man , to lose a piece of his brain like that and still be able to wiggle his toes . It was raining in Washington . A dirty , late-afternoon , big-city . September rain that did not stop . The big plane without windows landed at Andrews Air Force Base at 3:30 . A covered ramp was wheeled to the rear of the plane and a blue bus with racks for stretchers was hacked up to the ramp , and men began to go on the plane and carry stretchers off and put them on the racks on the bus . Mark Guzevich , who was 19 years old , had left Yokohama , Japan , 18 hours earlier , on a brown canvas stretcher with a new white bandage around his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on one of the racks . The bus moved slowly through the rain . Mark Guzevich was smiling . " Where exactly is this ? " he wanted to know . The way they did it in other wars was different . Then they would send the badly wounded to a hospital behind the front and the man would stay there for months , and if it was a good hospital , far enough behind the front , maybe there would be a slow overhead fan making circles on the ceiling and maybe not too many flies . In this war it is different . Vietnam : The Jet-Set War . Whoosh , they fly you into battle . Whoosh , they fly you out . No more troopships , no more gooks . For a while they did it right away-24 hours from battlefield to backyard . Hut too many died on the way . So hospitals were built in the Philippines and in Japan and now you go there first . Until your condition has " stabilized , " to use the military word . This means until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The condition of Mark Guzevich had " stabilized " 17 days after he was shot . The bus at Andrews Air Force Base took him to a place that is called The Ponderosa . It used to he the base hospital , built in 1 941 and looking it . Now it is used only as a resting place for the men who come hack from the war . The average stay . according to the Air Force , which is very good at computing such figures . is 161. , . hours . There are five wards . 130 beds , in The Ponderosa . Mark Guzevich got one with a card at the end that said GULCEV1CK . The doctor came around . " How are you feeling ' ? " " Fine . Fine .

We 'll put a new one on in the morning before you leave . " " OK . Fine . " The doctor moved on . " He 's a very lucky young man , " the doctor said . Then there were the Red Cross ladies . No parades for the wounded . No kisses or confetti . But Red Cross ladies with wire baskets . " Would you like some toothpaste ' ? " " I have some , thank you . " " How about some cigarettes ' ?

" Mark Guzevich looked at the Red Cross lady . She looked back at him . " Oh , no , I do n't suppose you need a comb , " she said . It was dark outside now . Mark Guzevieh was lying on the bed , a Washington Star at his side . He had eaten dinner and made his free , three-minute phone call home . His family , crying and excited , had talked more than he had . They had known he was coming back  --  he had told them in a letter from Japan  --  but they had not known when and they had not known how he would he . All they had heard was " head injury , critical condition , " and they had been afraid . " My Dad was telling me , I guess they 're really making me out to be some kind of a big hero at home .

He was sent to Guam to do exercises with his hand . He had been back in action just two weeks when the bullet hit him in the head . He was a private 1st class in the Marines . A year out of high school in Kenilworth , N.J. He had been a fullback . Guzevich : Number 44 . Now the bandage was off his head so the air could get at the incision , and there was part of his brain missing and he could not hear in his right ear and they told hint no drinking for a year because there was danger of seizure , and he was in this place called The Ponderosa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more months to serve in Vietnam . " How can they send you back ' ? You 've been shot twice . Shot in the head . " " That does n't matter to the Marines . All the Marines do is count . The Vietnam tour is thirteen months . I 've served lour . I 've got nine to go . " " Yeah , but with an injury like this .... " " I do n't know . Maybe you 're right . Maybe they wo n't send me back . " " Do you want to go back ' ? " " Are you kidding ' ? Want to go back ? I never want to see that place again or hear about it as long as I live . " They put him on a plane to Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn , and the plane landed in the sun and there was a good saltwater breeze . They put him on a blue hospital bus : on a rack , in the hack . " I joined the Marines  --  well , I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and all gung-ho . " The bus was bouncing along the Belt Parkway. , into Queens . " I thought the Marines were the best . It 's no secret that their training is tougher than anybody else 's , and figured it would he good : you know , make a man out of me . " He put his lingers to his head and laughed . " Maybe they did , " he said . " I 'm the only guy front my class who 's been to Vietnam . I think I must appreciate things a little more now because of it . Over there , for instance , getting cleaned up once a week really made you feel good . Or if you could stay dry for a whole day , that was a big thing . That was wonderful . Or just staying alive for one more day . You were thankful at the end of every day . I mean you really thought about it . And look , in high school who thinks about staying alive ? You take it for granted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly know any of them . - then you gel over to Nam and  --  well . like I said  --  I 'm nineteen years old and maybe that 's not old but I feel old . I saw a lot of war . And I saw a lot of guys , I mean , hell , hundreds of guys get messed up . " A man in a white suit came back to ask him how he was feeling . He told the man he was feeling fine . The bus ride was much bouncier than the plane had been . The rack he was lying on kept jerking up and down . " That first time I got shot , " he was saying , " we were out on patrol and I was second . right behind the point man . We got ambushed and right away the point man got killed . Then , in the afternoon , after we laid low for a while , we had to come down the side of the hill , not back along the trail , and cut our own path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me tell you it was n't easy . It took us six hours to get hack to camp and we had to carry the point man 's body all the way . Drag it down the side of the hill . " The bus was in city traffic now . In the Laundromat world of Queens . " 1 might as well tell you , I guess . I 'm more of a hawk than a dove , " Mark Guzevieh said . " I mean if it was just as far as they were concerned , 1 would n't give a damn . I got no love for the gooks or their culture or any of that stuff , but we have a commitment and we ca n't just come crawling home with our tail between our legs . At least that 's the way I feel . I think we have to stay we get a just and honorable p " What does that mean ? " " 1 think it means until we make sure that they 've got a government that 's strong enough to stand up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it ought to be some kind of a democracy . And they 've got to get their own army strong enough to protect it . " " Do you think that will ever hap-pen ' ? " " I do n't know . I think they 're getting better . Look , what I 'm telling you is just my opinion . If these hippies and people like that feel different  --  well , that 's fine . I can understand that . And if they want to demonstrate , that 's fine , too . As long as they do n't come around and say , ' Ha-ha , we 're glad you got shot because you did n't belong there anyway . ' I would n't like that too uch . " He was quiet for a while , thinking . And looking up at the roof of the bus . The hospital was not far away . " I know it 's not the same as when my father fought . He was in the Marines in World War II and that was to save our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same kind of thing . " " Does that make it harder to risk your life ' ? " " I guess it would if you thought about it . Sure I guess it would . But you do n't have time to think over there , you just try to get through day to day . " Now  --  now i will have time to think . And like go hack .

There arc 1,400 patients at St. Albans , including 450 to 500 Marines , most of them wounded in Vietnam . Mark Guzevich was put in Ward C-3 , neurosurgical , where men hurt worse than he was , men who had lost more than a portion of a frontal lobe , were lying in beds , staring and moaning and babbling . Others were reading movie magazines or comic books . " This is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now would n't say there 's absolutely no damage . I would n't say quite that . But there does not appear to be any damage that will affect him . Let 's put it this way . If Ted Williams were to lose a portion of a frontal lobe , he 'd still be Ted Williams and he could walk and talk and still probably play baseball , but maybe he would not be able to hit quite the same way . Maybe on that level there would be just that shade of difference . But when you 're talking about that boy in there , it 's different . Again . 1 would not say there is no damage , I would not say that at all . But once his hair grows back nobody will be able to tell him from you or from me . " Mark Guzevich was looking out the window at that strangely quiet part of Queens . Buses were stopping along Linden Boulevard and letting people off after work . The sun was drifting away behind the neat little houses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and started a block away from the hospital . Danang was the other side of the world , another world . " My parents are really happy , " Mark Guzevich was saying . " They 're coming over tomorrow . They do n't believe I 'm really OK . I had to keep telling them . They were worried about brain damage and all . Boy , this sure is decent . You know , bringing you back to a hospital so close to home . " In the bed across from him , two attendants were trying to feed a peanut-butter and jelly sandwich to a man who weighed less than 100 pounds . The man could not talk or sit up . He lay for hours at a time on his side with his eyes open until someone came to change his linen . " Come on , just try to take a small bite . " The man made a noise . His skin was saggy , like an elephant 's , and the hones showed through . " Come on , try to sit up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was when he came in , " a Marine sergeant said . And Mark Guzevich picked up the copy of Time magazine he had been given and started to read about Denny McLain. the baseball player on the cover . Once his hair grows back nobody will be able to tell him from you or from me . The bodies conic to Saigon in rubber bags , Men in green smocks are waiting in the room , which has pale green walls . When the bodies come , the men open the bags and slide the bodies onto steel platforms that rise to waist level from the floor . Then the men try to find out who the bodies used to be . Sometimes it is hard to tell about the bodies right away . Sometimes the men can not tell for hours , even days . When this happens , or simply when the embalming room is full , the bodies are put in a refrigerator . There are actually three refrigerators , walk-ins , with heavy doors and handles that click , like those in the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until someone finds out who they were or until there is a table open in the room where they will be embalmed . The smell is always here because there are so many bodies , whether the big doors are open or closed , but the men who work with it are used to it and do not mind . Occasionally a new man comes in who can not take it . He is transferred quickly , without disgrace . The major understands . Basic embalming : " The fine points of cosmetology we leave to the mortician back home , " the major says . " But we send , oh , I 'd say seventy to seventy-five percent home viewable , and we think that 's something to be proud of . " When the embalming is done the bodies lie and wait through the night . Eight hours , at least , for tissue to be preserved . Then it is morning and time for packing to begin , The first body is carried into the packing room and set down next to a table . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sleeveless green smock , sweat already rolling down the sides of his chest , turns down the front of the bag : a ship steward turning down the bed . Strips of cotton are laid inside the bag . Then a powder which hardens at the touch of moisture . Just in case there is a leak . Then the first one  --  cotton over the eyes and crotch  --  is put inside the plastic bag , and they wheel the table to the vacuumer , The vacuumer reaches into the plastic bag with the hose in his hand and sucks out all the air . His machine whirs and the plastic crinkles as it collapses around the body . Then masking tape around the top of the bag so no air can creep back in and undo the embalmer 's work during the long flight home . And the body moves down the line .

He also said he was trying to read his Bible like she had told him to . but it kept getting wet . He enclosed a picture of himself and two friends , grinning , dressed in fatigues . A man in a uniform came to the Wailers ' house that night . He told them James had been killed . He said it had happened in an attack on the base camp in the middle of the night . He said a telegram would follow . And there would be a Captain Woolley calling soon to help with the funeral arrangements .

It went immediately to the base mortuary , where the man in charge noted the recommendation that had been attached to it in Saigon : Non-viewable . That meant that James Waller would skip a step in the process . He would not have to he cosmeticized . Only the rough work , only the basic essential health procedures are taken in Saigon . The fancy stuff , the detail work , that is all done in Dover . Then the escort detail was notified and Sgt. 011ie Dyson , of Chicago , was told to report at 9 A.M. Wednesday , to accompany the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Philadelphia . James Waller was removed from the aluminum carrying case and placed in a metal casket , which was sealed . The carrying case was washed and stacked with the others to await return to Saigon . The Ray Funeral Home is in the section of Philadelphia called The Jungle . Across the street were Pop &; Curly 's Dauphin Bar , Bennie 's Good-Time Bar and the boarded windows of what once had been the Rescue the Perishing Pentecostal Church . The funeral home was not expecting James Waller 's body Wednesday morning . Mrs. Deso Ray , the wife of the owner , said no telegram of notification had come . It was I I o'clock and hot . 011ie Dyson and the hearse driver and a helper of Mr. Ray's. named William . carried the casket up the steps . Mr. Ray was not there . The casket was placed in a shaded room in the rear of the funeral home : the gray metal was covered by a bright American flag . When Mr. Ray returned , 011ie Dyson handed him a letter : To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipped to your funeral home consistent with the desires of the family . 2 .

Before shipment , the remains and casket were inspected by Air Force representatives and found to be in satisfactory condition . 4 . We would appreciate your cooperation in explaining this matter to the family should they question the reason for a sealed casket . Mrs. Waller could not understand about the casket . " Do n't worry about it , ' ' her husband told her . " It does n't make any difference . " But how do I know it 's him ? " " It 's him . " " But why ca n't we see him ? ' ' " Do n't worry about it .

As our Nation strives human dignity which we hold dear most distressing thing ... through their devoted service ... remain strong and our purpose steadfast .... At 4:30 Wednesday afternoon . five and a half hours after the body had arrived , the final telegram came : ilENtAiNs PE ( ' .1.5 . MES WALLED .

Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boyles Galvanizing and Plating Company . He wore a medal with a picture of Martin Luther King . James had been their second son . Sidney was one year older . There were also two younger daughters . " The insurance man was by today and he said I ought to frame that letter , " Mrs. Waller said to her hus-band , He was staring at the floor . " Did you hear me ? The insurance man says we ought to frame this letter from the chief of staff . " " Yes , I hear you , " " Well ' ? " " Well , well  --  well , what ' ? Fine . Frame it . " Mrs. Waller put the letter down and picked up the picture that James had sent her from Vietnam . " Poor James . " she said . " He only just got there in June . He did n't know what it was all about . I told the papers he did n't have any comments about the war . Well , he did have one . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is crazy . I do n't understand it . ' " " Who does understand it ? " John Waller said . Mrs. Waller did not answer . " If they had only give him a chance . " the father said . " They come up on him in the middle of the night and he was probably sleeping and never even saw them . He was out there in the front row for two months and then he goes back for a rest and they sneak up on him in the middle of the night . " John Waller shook his head . " He could have gone to jail , " Mrs. Waller said . " He could have been one of those boys who goes to jail because they do n't want to be in the war . " " He 's not that type . " " No , but if he had done that he 'd of been alive . " " He 's not that type . To go to jail . That was n't how James was . " " No , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The father nodded . " He never went anywhere that he did n't come back with a piece of paper that said how good he was , " Mrs. Waller said . " He got one , look here , from Dobbins , where he went to high school , and one from the R.W. Brown Boys Club and here , one from the American Legion . ... " " And then they sneak up on him in the middle of the night . ' ' " James never want to do no killing anyway . " " No , that 's right . He told the Army he wanted to he a clerk . " " But they told him he could n't because he did n't have experience . " " He did n't have experience killing either . " " That 's right , he did n't have no experience with guns . " " But that did n't matter , did it ? " " No. they did n't care about experience with the guns . " " What I do n't understand , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him how to kill why could n't they teach him how to type ' ? " They came down the steps with the casket very slowly . There were only three of them to carry it , which made it heavy . It was six o'clock Monday night . The sun was still warm , the air heavy and hot . The doors of the Good-Time were open and men looked out from the darkness as the American flag and the box underneath it were put into the hack of the Cadillac hearse . When they got to the Thankful Baptist Church , 10 minutes away , George Ray asked about flowers . " There 's not very many . " a church custodian said . " I put what there is up front . " There were two wreaths that said THE FAMILY , one that said THE NEIGH-Hogs and one that said THE GANG . George Ray placed them symmetrically around the casket . " I 'll be hack about a quarter to eight with the family . " he said . It was cool inside the church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were light brown , well-waxed . James Waller 's casket was in the front , near the altar , where it was very still . The funeral began with an organist playing America the Beautiful in a thin and quiet way . Then there were hymns and readings from the Bible and then a kid named Glenn Kennedy , a kid who had been a friend of James Waller , got up to read all the cards and telegrams that had been received . There were telegrams from the Governor and the Cardinal and Senator Clark , who was running for re-election , and Representative Schweiker , who was running against him , and from many other people who did not know what it smells like in North Philadelphia along Dauphin Street where James Waller grew up , or what it smells like in the mortuary in Saigon . Then a man who had taught James Waller plumbing at the Murrell Dobbins school got up and said what a hero the boy had been , dying for his country , and how much more representative he was than these hippies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to go . and maybe someday soon the country would all pull to- ' , ether and unite behind the war and then the " other forces would see the futility of continuing the struggle . " Then a kid named Edward Marks , a THREE CAME HOME friend in an Army uniform , ( 1 , ho had just come hack from Vietnam , stood up . He tried to talk but it was Into hard arid he sobbed , and Mrs. Waller , in her seat . gave out a little cry and lurched forward and began to cry , and Award Marks just said , quickly , " He was a wonderful kid , " ; 111 ( 1 hurried away from the altar . Then later , at the end , after an hour and a half , Mrs. Waller suddenly stood up and stepped out of her pew and walked to the casket and before anybody really noticed her she screamed and threw herself on the casket and began pulling at the flag . The screams came from somewhere very deep and they filled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flag off the casket and was pressing her face into the hare gray metal when they got to her . She fought them and she kept on screaming , and in the pew the teen-age daughter began to cry , " Jesus . . Jesus Oh , Jesus ... " and there were four men around James Waller 's mother and they were holding her with a very tight grip . When they got her back to the pew . George Ray came over to 011ie Dyson and whispered and 011ie Dyson walked to the casket and put the flag hack on and straightened it . The next day was quick . There were clouds and one of the first winds of autumn was blowing brown leaves from the trees . Philadelphia National Cemetery was small and neat , with the rows and rows of identical white tombstones sweeping across the grass . There was a four-man firing squad down from Fort Dix , and a six-man honor guard as pallbearers , and a bugler who stood alone under a big oak tree by a fence , There were only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sidney , the brother , had to stand . He was 21 years old and he was all stooped over like his father . At the end , everyone walked by and put a flower on the casket . The flag had been taken off and folded in that tense ceremony that the military always has with the flag , and then it had been given to Mr. Waller . The people came by and put their flowers on the gray metal , maybe 50 of them all together , and then Sidney Waller put his flower there , and the two sisters , and Mr. Waller and finally James Waller 's mother , who did it very quickly and quietly and moved away with her husband 's arm around her . They walked back to their cars in the driveway in the middle of the cemetery and the sun was out now and it was still summer . A man in a red T-shirt who had been driving a power mower and had stopped it started again and the motor sound came across the cemetery . The man drove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and got off and began to fold the metal chairs . Another man , in a green shirt and green pants , swept all the flowers off 58 the casket with his arm , I hen the Iwo men got down on their knees and they were joined by a third man in green pants and there was another man in a suit who was holding a clipboard , and the three of them began to work while Ihe man with the clipboard stood there , and in the driveway 50 yards away the family of James Waller sat in the car and waited to he taken away . The casket had rested on two green planks above the open grave . Now the men pulled the planks away and the casket was on two canvas straps ihat were wound around a set of silver poles that could he turned when the screws were loosened . The men loosened the screws and the poles began to turn as the weight of the casket strained against the straps and the casket lurched a bit and one end slid down a fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even . In the car in the driveway . Mr. and Mrs. John Waller watched the gray metal disappear and Mr. Waller held the American gag in his lap . EPILOGUE Mark Guzevich did not go hack to Vietnam . He was kept in St. Albans Naval Hospital until the second week of November and then sent to a Veterans Hospital in New Jersey , which allows him to go home on weekends . " I feel pretty good , " he says , " hut the doctors still do n't know about the ear . They say the hearing might come back and it might not . " He will soon be out of the Marines . A medical discharge . But he has nowhere to go , at least until the spring . " They 've decided to put a plate in my head , but they 're not going to operate until February or March . For now I guess I 'll just be staying at the hospital . They 're giving me aptitude tests , and when they 're through with those I 'll start thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with this operation coming up I guess there 's really not too much of a rush . " Five weeks after he came home , Jerry Spitzer and Betty were married . " II was kind of quick , " he said , " hut she pretty well nailed me down . " They live in Anderson . about 40 miles from Richmond , and Jerry works in a factory . He often thinks of Vietnam . He has even thought about returning . " I kind of feel sorry for those people over there , " he says . " Of course , I do n't think I actually would go back . " He has not heard from the men he fought with . No plans have been made for the reunion in New York ; it is not likely they will be . He reads " just what 's on the front page " about the war but does not think the Paris talks will end it . " Somebody 's just going to have to up and pull our boys out of there , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all these taxes got out here , " he is content . ?
