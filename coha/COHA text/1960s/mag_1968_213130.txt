James J. Ling , 45 , chairman of Dallas-based Ling-Temco-Vought Inc. , is a military buff who describes the conferences that lead up to his corporate takeovers as " war games . " Last week , after a long war game , Ling made a tender offer for a controlling 62% of the stock of Pittsburgh 's Jones &; Laughlin Steel Co. , the nation 's fifth largest steelmaker . The offer meant that LTV stood ready to ante up $425 million in one of the largest cash tender offers ever made ; at $85 per share , it also meant that Ling , to ensure quick action , was paying a big bonus on shares that opened last week at $50 , closed at $77 , thereby moved up 27 points in five days as the camp followers took quick advantage of the war games . And since <P> J. &; L. 's board of directors is unopposed , the offer is most likely to be accepted ; the steel company will probably become the biggest single unit in a conglomerate that already includes such divisions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and floor coverings , airplane , missile and electronics manufacturing and , since last February , Braniff Airlines and National Car Rental . <P> Of the $425 million involved , Ling will borrow $100 million from a syndicate of U.S. , Canadian and European financial institutions with Wall Street 's Lehman Bros , and Goldman , Sachs acting as bankers . Another $200 million is on hand as ready cash , including $60 million from a public sale of 600,000 shares of LTV stock last fall . LTV will raise the rest of the necessary money by selling off its interest in two insurance companies , Stonewall <P> Insurance and American Amicable , and the First Western Bank &; Trust Co. of Los Angeles . <P> Whether Ling can succeed in the close-knit steel industry-where other conglomerate kings like Norton Simon have failed-remains to be seen . LTV plans to stick to a well-tried tactic : as in earlier acquisitions , it will go along with the old management . The stock that LTV acquires will be put into a five-man voting trust until 1971 , with present J. &; L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there will be plenty of dividends for LTV . Jones &; Laughlin recently reported first-quarter earnings of $11,706,000 on sales of $277 million . In his tender announcement last week , Ling also noted that the company is involved in a threeyear , $400 million improvements program , which ought to sustain earnings in years to come . All that should make J. &; L. an attractive occupied territory for any corporate armchair general .
