It was a fine day for a Sunday drive , all right , but the men tooling up the road to Montalto , a rugged 6,417-ft. peak in the toe of the Italian boot , were hardly your average weekend motorists . Noting the stream of big cars - Pugeots , Mercedes and Citrens-a cruising carabiniere radioed his suspicions to Police Chief Alberto Sabatino in nearby Reggio di Calabria , capital of dirt-poor Calabria province . Chief Sabatino agreed that such a caravan could mean only one thing . <P> Sabatino dispatched four twelve-man patrols to Montalto . The local cops and national carabinieri Jeeped to within a mile of the peak , then fanned out on foot . Climbing through oak and beech , then pine and fir , one of the carabinieri patrols suddenly flushed a man with a gun , who appeared to be some sort of sentry . Persuaded by the gun in his back , the sentry led the police up to a glade where some 130 men were gathered . Six of the men , apparently wary of informers , wore black hoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of L'Onorata Societ ( the Honored Society ) , Calabria 's branch of the Mafia . <P> When the patrol commander squeezed off some warning shots , most of the Mafiosi melted into the mountain woods . The rest , taking cover behind rocks or in the scraggy Calabrian underbrush , opened up with pistols , shotguns and hunting rifles , wounding seven cops and taking two injuries of their own in a half-hour firefight . When it was all over , the police gathered up a sackful of weapons , 35 cars that had been abandoned on goat paths , and 21 gunmen aged 19 to 75 . But the pezzi grossi ( big shots ) got away . <P> Power Struggle . Why all the artillery ? As the cops figure it , the thugs were less afraid of a police bust than of each other . The meeting in the mountains was apparently called to settle a power struggle between the younger Mafiosi , who are keen on such things as dope smuggling , kidnaping and other urban crimes , and their extortion-oriented elders , who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past two years , Calabrian officials , using special legislation , have sent 274 Mafiosi into " enforced residence " in Northern Italy , threatened another 789 with similar exile , put 198 under surveillance , and revoked the driver 's licenses of 452 others . <P> According to the police , last week 's mass meeting was " without precedent " in Calabria . The hoods did , however , steal a few lines from some distant cousins . After the famous 1957 raid at Apalachin , N.Y. , the 60 mobsters who were seized there explained that they had assembled for nothing more sinister than a friendly cookout . To a man , the Montalto Mafiosi insisted that they were just " gathering mushrooms . "
