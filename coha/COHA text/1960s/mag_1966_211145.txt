Editor Frank Conniff propped his feet on his desk and took command of a city room that had been painfully silent for months . Word was out that the New York newspaper strike was over at last . The pressmen , last of the squabbling unions to make peace , had finally settled ; the stereotypers were scheduled to vote approval of their contract at week 's end . The long-deferred New York World Journal Tribune was actually getting ready to put out a newspaper , and Conniff 's phone rang constantly . Columnist after columnist wanted to ask his new boss for the honor of appearing in the first issue . <P> Conniff handled his callers with the good humor , occasional exasperation and unflagging optimism of a man delighted to be back on the job . The new paper , he conceded , would combine most of the features of the three papers it absorbed : the Herald Tribune , the World-Telegram , the Journal-American . " We 're not going to emulate any one of them , " said Conniff , as he planned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a six-column page on Sundays . " This paper will look like itself . " <P> Overabundant Columnists . By no accident , it will look like all three of its predecessors . It will be broken into four sections , and in makeup and type , Page 1 of the first section will be reminiscent of the Telegram . The first page of the second section will have a calculated familiarity for old Trib readers , as it gives prominence to Columnists Dick Schaap , Art Buchwald and Jimmy Breslin . Pages 2 and 3 of the second section will contain the editorials and a constantly changing panorama of other columnists-for all the world like the departed Journal-American . <P> His biggest problem promises to be too many columnists . All three of the old dailies had picked up the habit of accumulating columnists , and last week Conniff faced the task of finding space for Pundits Walter Lippmann , Joseph Alsop , Rowland Evans , Robert Novak , Henry J. Taylor , William F. Buckley Jr. , William S. White , Bob Considine and Jim Bishop . For sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cannon . And then , besides Buchwald and Schaap , there were Walter Winchell , Harriet Van Home , John McClain , Frank Farrell . <P> To be sure , at the urging of New York Post Publisher Dorothy Schiff , the Justice Department has demanded that some of the syndicated columnists who appeared in the now-defunct Herald Tribune be put on the New York market for competitive bidding . Which means that Mrs. Schiff will have the opportunity to try for Lippmann , Alsop , Buchwald , Evans and Novak . Which columnists she wants , she has not said . " I do n't know how the hell she can outbid us unless we get a little complacent , " says Conniff.
