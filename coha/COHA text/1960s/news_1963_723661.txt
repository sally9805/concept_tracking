txt President Johnson announced tonight that he would appoint Thomas C. Mann , the Ambassador to Mexico , as Assistant Secretary of State for LatinAmerican Affairs . Mr. Mann will have wide authority to coordinate political and economic policy in that area . Mr. Mann , who conferred with the President today , will replace Edwin M. Martin . The announcement appeared to portend a sharp change in the State Department 's method of handling Latin-American policy and the Alliance for Progress . The appointment of Mr. Mann will be the first that President Johnson has made at that level of the Government . Mr. Martin will be assigned to a major ambassadorial post in Latin America . Pierre Salinger , the White House press secretary , said that such a post for Mr. Martin had been under discussion before President Kennedy 's death . The apparent change in State Department lines of authority , Associated Press Thomas C. Mann however , is believed to be primarily Mr. Johnson 's decision . Mr. Salinger , who made public the President 's intention , said Mr. Mann would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of LatinAmerican policy , under the direction of the President and the Secretary of State . He would not say whether this meant that Mr. Mann would have policy control over the Alliance for Progress , the United States 10-year program for economic assistance in Latin America . The Alliance is now administered by the Agency for International Development , which is headed by David E. Bell . Teodoro Moscoso is the coordinator of the Alliance program . Well-informed Administration sources said Mr. Johnson intended Mr. Mann to have the authority to coordinate all aspects political , economic and military  --  of United States policy in Latin America . Mr. Salinger , refusing to be specific about the Alliance for Progress , *said only that the intention to coordinate all aspects ' I of policy was stronger than it had been in the east . Would Require Legislation If the Alliance for Progress were placed . under the direct control of the Assistant Secretary for Latin-American Affairs , its removal from the aid agency would require legislation by Congress . " Mr. Mann is going to have to look at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to confer with the Secretary of State , Mr. Moscoso , Mr. Bell . " Mr. Salinger would not say that the wide authority contemplated for Mr. Mann would downgrade the post held by Mr. Moscoso , or that Mr. Moscoso would be removed . Apparently any such developments will await decisions by Mr. Mann under his mandate for policy coordination . A less sweeping change in Latin-American policy handling had been under consideration by the Kennedy Administration , largely due to changes in the Alliance structure effected at a conference in Sao Paulo , Brazil , last month . Mr. Johnson apparently plans to go much further than Mr. Kennedy had contemplated . One report circulating here this week was that ultimately he would call for the establishing of the post of Under Secretary of State for Latin-American Affairs . That , too , would require Congressional action , Mr. Johnson is said to feel with many influential member : . of Congress , that the Alliance has not moved swiftly enough and that its leadership and administration must be toughened A related development this weekend was the deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House Appropriations Committee as part of a general reduction in foreign aid . Mr. Mann , a Texan and a personal friend of Mr. Johnson , is widely experienced in the State Department , Latin-American matters and diplomacy in general . He has been serving in Mexico City since he was appointed by President Kennedy in May , 1961 . Before that Mr. Mann was Assistant Secretary of State for Latin-American affairs under President Dwight D. Eisenhower , the , same post to which Mr. Johnson now will appoint him . But at that time ' the  --  Assistant Secretary did not have the broad authority for over-all policy coordination that the President now intends for him . Mr. Mann 's interest in LatinAmerican affairs predates his first service in the assistant secretaryship , however . In 1957,1 General Eisenhower appointed him Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs and in that position , too , he took a particular interest in such LatinAmerican problems as economic development and trade . In August , 1960 , General Eisenhower named him the Assistant Secretary for Latin America . He was one of the authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Alliance for Progress . Mr. Mann , a native of Laredo , Tex. , on the Mexican border , was 51 years old last month . A graduate of Baylor University in Waco in 1934 , he practiced law in Laredo until 1942 , then accepted a Foreign Service post in Uruguay . In 1943 he was first assigned to the State Department . After holding a number of State Department posts , he was assigned to the Office of American Republic Affairs in 1947 . Later he served as Second Secretary at the embassy in Caracas , Venezuela , as director of the State Department Office of Middle American Affairs , and as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs . He was Counselor of Embassy in Greece and Guatemala and in 1955 was named Ambassador to El Salvador . Mr. Mann speaks excellent Spanish with a Mexican accent . Mr , Martin , 55 , had served as Assistant Secretary since March . He came to the post after service in the State Department since 1945.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
