txt Senator Jacob K. Javits proposed today that the Republican candidate for Mayor of New York be chosen informally next month , clearing the way for a 10-month campaign . While he would not take himself out of the running , Mr. Javits indicated strongly that he would not be available for the nomination . He said he expected to make his position clear in January . The Senator declined to recommend a candidate or even suggest a list of possibilities . In response to questions , however , he said that Representative John V. Lindsay would certainly be . an " outstanding " nominee , among others . Seeks ' a Comer ' To the reporters . who sat at , a luncheon table in the Seria- , tor 's office , Mr. Javits often seemed to be describing Representative Lindsay as he outlined his prescription for a candidate : " Young . . . a corner . . . a man well known in the city but with outside experience . . . someone who commands the confidence of the votes .... " Senator Javits said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the state 's Republican leaders collectively . The five Republican county chairmen from New // York City , he said , should play a " critically important " role , but along with other leaders . Among the latter he included Governor Rockefeller , himself , George L. Hinman , the Republican National Committeeman ; State Chairman Fred A. Young , Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz , Representatives Lindsay , Ogden R. Reid and Charles E. Goodell and Thomas E. Dewey , Bruce Bromley and Herbert Brownell . The Legislature sets the date for the primary election in which candidates for Mayor are formally nominated . Until the date is set there is no specific deadline for the designation of candidates by the party leadership . Republicans usually have favored a primary in the fall , to set up a short campaign , while Democrats have favored a primary in the spring . As Mr. Javits sees it , the election is crucial for the Republicans in the wake of their dismal showing last month 111 around the state . " We 've got to do something . really do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican party is on the rise again , " he declared , " Let 's face it : the Goldwater debacle hurt New York Republicans very badly . " He refused , however , to say that a Republican comeback in New York State rested squarely on the outcome of the 1965 New York City election . That and the 1966 election for Governor , together , will be " the real acid tests for the Republican party , he said . Asked if Mr. Lindsay did not seem to fit his description of the ideal mayoral candidate , Senator Javits replied : ' There are other young people in New York , there are other young Republicans who might conceivably fit the pattern . I 'm not willing to name names now . " " Of course , " he added , " if John wishes to be a candidate , he certainly would be a frontrunner . " Mr. Lindsay won re-election to his 17th District seat in Manhattan by more than 95,000 votes last month . In the face of President Johnson 's record New York landslide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sentor Javits said that the choice Of a mayoral candidate could also have an important effect on Republican prospects for regaining control of the Legislature in the special election now set for next fall . On the national political scene , Mr. Javits said that Dean Burch should " step down " as national chairman as a symbol of a defeated brand of Republicanism . He proposed that a Republican advisory committee be established to help guide the party along more liberal lines . Sometime in 1965 or 1966 , he suggested , a Republican convention of some sort should be held to rewrite the 1964 platform and provide a different document that Republican Congressional candidates could run on in 1966 . Mr. Javits defended his own refusal  --  and that of other liberal Republicans  --  to endorse Senator Barry Goldwater during the campaign . Although the election did not send any new Javits type of Republicans to the Senate , the New Yorker feels that the results actually may have indirectly advanced his type of party philosophy in the Senate . " From talks , I 've had already , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think there is going to be a far more congenial atmosphere for my ideas there than ever before . "
