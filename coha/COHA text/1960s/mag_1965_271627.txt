Resplendent in a freshly pressed uniform , a stocky , scar-faced man wearing brigadier general 's rank marched stiffly through the ruined doorway of the Dominican Republic 's Congressional Assembly Hall . He was a Dominican national hero , Antonio Imbert Barreras , 44 , one of the two surviving assassins of Dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo . Honored with a general 's commission , he had been living quietly in the background . Now he had come as the anti-Communist head of a new five-man loyalist junta , replacing the three soldiers installed by Brigadier General Wessin y Wessin a fortnight ago , hoping to pacify his small Caribbean country torn by one of the bloodiest civil wars in recent Latin American history . <P> " Citizens , " said Imbert , after taking the oath of office , " our capital is in ruins . Our national life is in pieces . Dominicans of all sectors have come forth in order that we can form a government of national reconstruction . We do not desire anything other than the salvation of our fatherland . " Imbert 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an air force colonel from Wessin y Wessin 's government ; in a gesture to the rebels who had started the revolt in the name of deposed President Juan Bosch , he included a pro-Bosch editor . <P> Imbert appealed to the rebels holed up in downtown Santo Domingo to surrender their weapons , guaranteed their safe-conduct " without reservations . " He called for peace , unity , bound himself " to cooperate totally " with the Organization of American States , and , with the U.S. , struggle to bring at least a semblance of sanity to his battered , forsaken land . He claimed he had control of all 25 Dominican provinces and 90% of the capital district . He asked all public employees to return to work , promised that his government would start paying salaries promptly . <P> Another Fidel ? Thus , late last week , the Dominican Republic got a loyalist government that could assert its right to govern against the claims of the so-called " constitutionalist " government of Rebel Colonel Francisco Caamao De , 32 , the officer who triggered the revolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is quarrelsome , opportunistic , a plotter who , in the words of one U.S. official , " has the potential of becoming another Fidel Castro . " His father , Lieut . General Fausto Caamao , was boss of Trujillo 's secret police , took a leading part in the 1937 slaughter of 15,000 Haitian squatters . Young Caamao joined the navy in 1950 , proved so contentious that he was bucked to the marines , next to the police , finally to the army . He helped in the 1963 coup that exiled Bosch , and plotted against his successor .
