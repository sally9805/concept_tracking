Virtually every U.S. infant born under a doctor 's care gets three shots , spaced a month apart , of a three-way vaccine against diphtheria , whooping cough and tetanus , or " lockjaw . " Most children receive a booster shot a year later . Many get additional tetanus toxoid boosters in school or college-and , of course , in the armed forces . <P> Are all these shots necessary ? No , says a group of experts headed by Harvard 's Dr. Thomas C. Peebles , who shared a Nobel prize for his part in the research that made polio vaccines possible . The experts do not intend to minimize the importance of vaccination against tetanus , the infection that usually results from deep and dirty wounds in which the tetanus bacteria can thrive without air . Every year it kills almost 200 Americans , the doctors point out in the New England Journal of Medicine . <P> The trouble with tetanus vaccination programs is that while some people never get the highly desirable shots , others may get too many . Anyone who suffers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot is almost certain to receive yet another booster . This is not necessary , judging from detailed laboratory work by Peebles and others . Men and women , they maintain , retain their immunity against tetanus for twelve or more years after those first four shots in childhood , and certainly should not need a booster more often than every ten years . More frequent revaccinations are not only unnecessary but potentially dangerous , say the doctors , since they may provoke allergic reactions against the toxoid itself .
