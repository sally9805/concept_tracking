In its time of trouble and hunger , Red China presumably looks to Russia for help . But to judge by the 1961 trade agreement between the Big Two of the Communist world published last week , the Red Chinese asked for bread and were given a stone . <P> Last year 's agreement grandiosely called for a 10% increase over 1959 's Sino Soviet trade target of nearly $2 billion . Russia was to supply mainly machinery and finished goods , to be paid for with Chinese foodstuffs and raw materials . But with its well-publicized drought ( " for 40 days it was possible to drive a car along the bed of the Yellow River , " said Chinese Ambassador to Poland Wang Ping-nan recently ) , Peking was unable to deliver its part of the bargain . Instead , China has been sent scrabbling to buy wheat for itself from Canada , foodstuffs from other non-Communist nations to feed the folks at home . <P> The Russians last week said coldly that they had no grain to spare for China , did not even proffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , Moscow will send China this year some 500,000 tons of sugar . Sugar is one food commodity that China does not need , since it is already committed to take 1,000,000 tons of Castro 's Cuban sugar . <P> Conclusion of Western Kremlinologists : the Russians may not be averse to showing the Chinese that they still have a long way to go before they are a power capable of challenging Russia 's leadership of the Communist world .
