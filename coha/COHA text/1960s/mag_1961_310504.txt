From a top Democrat last week came a considered criticism of U.S. handling of world affairs under both the Eisenhower and Kennedy Administrations . Said Washington 's Democratic Senator Henry M. Jackson , in summing up the two-year work of his Subcommittee on National Policy Machinery , which was created find out if the U.S. Government is geared to manage the cold war : " There is still much to be done in defining our vital interests and developing a basic national policy which supports them . " <P> Jackson 's sharpest words were aimed at the State Department : " No task is more urgent than improving the effectiveness of the Department of State . State is not doing enough in asserting its leadership across the whole front of foreign policy . It attaches too little importance to looking ahead . State needs more officials who are good executive managers , who have an ability to manage large-scale enterprises-to make decisions promptly and decisively , to delegate and to monitor . Round pegs in square holes are a luxury we can not afford . " <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are , he said , " people engaged in work that does not really need doing . The payroll costs , although formidable , are less important than the price paid in sluggishness of decision and action . " The really effective top civil service and sub-Cabinet officials should be kept in Government service by paying them more , and better people should be attracted to temporary high-level jobs by easing conflict-of-interest laws , which Jackson termed " pointless impediments to public service . " <P> Jackson also cautioned against the National Security Council 's becoming either so institutionalized as to engage in " the overproduction of routine papers , " or so informal as to disintegrate into " official bull sessions . " But after his committee had held some 50 hearings to take testimony from authorities including Secretary of State Dean Rusk , General Maxwell Taylor and New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller , Jackson was convinced that no basic reorganization of the nation 's policy machinery is really necessary . " More often than not , " he emphasized , " poor decisions are traceable not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehend the full significance of information crossing their desks , to their indecisiveness or lack of wisdom . Our best hope lies in making our traditional policy machinery work better-not in trading it in for some new model . "
