txt A member of The Tribune 's Washington bureau has gone to Viet Nam to give a first-hand account of the war-torn country in which 16,000 Americans are serving , and to tell why Washington wants to keep it from the Communists . This is the third of his reports . BY PHILIP DODD Chicago Tribune Press Service SAIGON , Viet Nam , June 14 - The jeep came to a jarring stop behind a long line of dilapidated buses , bicycles , motor scooters , and other traffic waiting to cross a one-way bridge . The young American captain riding on the front seat , his carbine ready , took a quick look around . Not another military vehicle was in sight . He signaled the Vietnamese driver to go to the head of the line . " Safer that way , " the captain explained . " This is Viet Cong country . " Area Is Prosperous We were on route 4 , the paved , narrow , bumpy highway that leads south from Saigon , South Viet Nam 's capital , to the prosperous , heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war were apparent minutes after we left bustling , peaceful Saigon . There was a checkpoint every few miles manned by stalwart little Vietnamese soldiers in olive-green battle dress and steel helmets . Our jeep was waved thru but civilian vehicles were stopped for questioning . Occasionally the ugly snout of a 155 mm. cannon could be seen in a bamboo patch . Such weapons are placed thruout the delta region . Army trucks were speeding up and down the highway , carrying soldiers and supplies . Every few miles a hamlet , surrounded by barbed wire and with a watchtower and earthen rifle pits , could be seen . Otherwise , the delta country looked like a land at p e a c e . Peasants worked the rice busy . Women crowded toward the jeep imploring us to buy vegetables , fruit , fish , pastry , and myriad other products . Beggars held out imploring hands . The stark truth is that the average Vietnamese country dweller ? he and his kind comprise 85 per cent of the population of South Viet Nam  --  could not care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , damaged crop s , misery . He only gets his dander up when Viet Cong guerrillas raid his hamlet , kidnaping and murdering . Such raids usually are intended to punish hamlets and villages which have cooperated with the Saigon government . So the natural tendency of most peasants is to say the hell with all governments . Hanlets Are Guarded In Viet Nam , particularly among its country people , the family is the principal institution . To a certain extent , Vietnamese law recognizes this fact . The government never interferes in family disputes , such as those over the distribution of property ; such matters are left to family elders . A family includes the ancestors back to the great - greatgrandfather . The older men act as judge and jury in family matters . Each member works for the common good of the family , not as an individual . Work for Family Good A Vietnamese family takes care of its members , protecting the old from insecurity and sharing all good fortune . Ideal as this may sound , it has led to political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution in which President Ngo Dinh Diem was deposed and killed was his habit of giving top jobs and other political plums to members of his family . When a baby is born to a country family , special care is taken to preserve the placenta . It is placed in an earthen jar and buried in the garden of the home . In the Vietnamese tradition , home is referred to as " the place where his placenta has been buried . " Abandoning one 's birthplace is considered a misfortune , a cause of much regret . That is why military officials run into trouble when they are forced to move families from their homes to clear areas adjacent to highways and military installations . Thatched-Roof Homes The peasant 's home usually is a thatched roof structure with mud walls and a pounded dirt floor , and little furniture except for the family altar , which contains a tablet bearing the names of the family ancestors . Beds usually are platforms of planks , sometimes as big as 8 by 5 feet the average Vietnamese man is about 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate , except in the high mountain country . Well-to-do country residents sometimes have pretentious homes with tile roofs and floors and wooden walls . Practically all houses , modest and pretentious , have their kitchens in adjoining but separate structures . Chinese Tea Expensive The Vietnamese diet is diversified , compared with diets of other Asian countries . The tropical climate , the sea , and the nearby mountains provide a wide variety of foods . Rice , of course , is the principal food at every meal , but to it are added fish , shrimp , crabs , beef , pork or poultry , and a wide variety of tropical fruits and vegetables . Principally , Vietnamese tea is drunk because Chinese tea is expensive and hard to come by these days . When a Vietnamese peasant decides to go on a binge , he turns to ruou rep , an alcoholic drink made from fermented glutinous rice . It is drunk straight but accompanied by an acid fruit , dried shrimp , hog tripe , fried palm worms , or dog meat . ( Next : Legend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddess.
