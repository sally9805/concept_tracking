Khaki is the Indian farmer 's word for the dusty , brown , bare countryside of northern India-a word that imperial British soldiers long ago adopted to describe the sand-drab color of their field uniforms . Last week , from the tea gardens of the Malabar Coast to the millet patches of the high Himalaya , Indians were discussing the government 's new third five-year plan ( 1961-66 ) , in which highest priority is assigned to agriculture . <P> The goal is a 33% increase in food production in five years-enough to enable India to feed itself . Western experts think it can be done , but the problem narrows down to the special and often exasperating problems of " the man behind the plow , " the Indian khaki farmer . <P> <P> One such farmer is wiry , half-naked Jagjit , sixtyish , whose 20 acres of Punjab sugar cane , wheat and pulses brought him a cash income of $485 last year . For weeks Jagjit worked night and day carrying buckets to save his half-acre patch of cane from the searing Indian sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wash away his fields . Jagjit can not afford to buy chemical fertilizer . He uses cow dung to manure his fields , but only during the monsoon , when the dung can not be dried ; the rest of the time he collects it in great mounds and uses it for fuel . " We know this is wasteful , " he said , " but there is nothing else to burn . " Joining his palms and gazing reverently upward , he murmured : <P> " If Paramatman God is not willing , then I must accept my fate . " <P> Blood &; Banians . Fate , for most khaki farmers , is another visit to the banian , or village moneylender . Of Jagjit 's 30-bushel wheat crop , the banian already gets about a third . The banian 's charge for a bushel of wheat : two bushels at harvest time , the equivalent of 100% interest . Yet Jagjit and others would rather take their chances with a local banian 's mercy than ask for government credit . " The government drinks the blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It charges 12% interest , and wants the money back as soon as the term of the loan is up . The banian can be shamed if you clasp your hands and plead , but not the government . If I default , it will sell my goods to pay my loan . " <P> As khaki farmers go , Jagjit must be accounted progressive . In all the 600,000 villages of India , only i% of the farmers till their land with anything more up to date than a metal-tipped stick . There are only 34,000 tractors in the whole country . But even if tractors were available in any quantity , most farmers ' plots are too tiny to justify their use . The government has persuaded only a few to band together in cooperatives . For an Indian feels deeply attached to his own land and hates the idea of working on someone else 's ; nor does he like to trust anyone else to do his buying and selling for him . Punjabi Farmer Parbhu Dayal , 62 , observed last week : " If the cooperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cooperative send it off to Delhi for repairs , and if the repairs cost 30 or 40 rupees , they mark it as 200 rupees in the accounts and pocket the difference .
