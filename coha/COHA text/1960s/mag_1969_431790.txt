Nine hundred miles east of Africa 's Atlantic ast and 150 miles south of Timbuktu and that er great sea , the Sahara , Sanga lies in the art of Dogon country . The Dogon , who cornse some 250,000 of Mali 's 4.7 million people , ve along a 90-mile stretch of escarpment called e Cliffs of Bandiagara ( maps , page 435 ) .

In April , less than two  | months later , I was heading back to Dogon country on a NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC assignment . In Dakar , Senegal 's capital , I boarded the diesel-powered Niger-Ocean Express for a rail journey to sultry Bamako @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mali 's national airline to Mopti , hired a government LandRover , and followed a dry , rutted road across the high plateau to Sanga , 70 miles to the east. * Once again I walked to the edge of the inhospitable cliffs and saw the homes of my friends below . Fabled Climbers Had Sticky Hands The Dogon , by their own telling , have not always dwelt here . More than 600 years ago they came from the southwest of Mali and retreated to the cliffs to protect their granaries from such hostile tribes as the Fulani . Earlier cliff dwellers were the Tellem , some of whom may have remained to greet the Dogon ; dates of Tellem occupancy are uncertain . " The Tellem were dwarfs , " a Dogon elder explained to me . " They had a special medicine they put on their hands to stick to cliffs , and they strung fiber bridges across the gorges . " Archeological findings suggest that the Tellem were of more normal proportions , and that their sticky fingers and suspension bridges are only myth . Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shallowest niches of the sheer cliff face awes even the Dogon . Sometimes the Dogon use these almost inaccessible storage places as graveyards . They lower the wrapped bodies of their dead with ropes made from the bark of the baobab tree , guide them into place , and seal the entrances with stones . From Sanga I headed north to Yenndouma , which I planned to make my headquarters , and , because the 14-mile route is only a narrow sandy track , I traveled on foot . Five shoeless porters carried equipment and a month 's supplies on their heads . We walked briskly across the wind-swept plateau , guided by Diangouno Dolo , an elder ' - See " Freedom Speaks French in Ouagadougou , " by John Scofield , GEOGRAPHIC , August 1966.  | of Sanga . Despite his surname , Diangounc was not related to Balpa Dolo . Among the Dogon all people of the same area have the same surname , and everyone in Sanga is a Dolo . As for Balpa , he never appeared during my brief revisit . Perhaps , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was early morning when we set out , and the breeze cut the 100 ? F. heat . Around the village of Koundou piles of firewood , protected from thieves by small wooden fetishes dotted the landscape . Great irregular swirl of rock left little room for the fields scratches out between . Now the fields lay fallow , wait ing for the rains to begin . The stream bed were empty , but the ripening berries on the sc trees signaled that the rains were not far off " You have drunk the juice of the sa , " Di angouno said , reminding me of the drink like sweet prune juice , I had tasted in Sanga " When the berries are ripe , the women collec  | them , dry them , and soak them in water . They use the oil from the seeds on their skin . " Since I know few phrases of the subtle Dogon language , Diangouno spoke to me in French , which he had learned during World War II while serving France in the Sahara . As we descended from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose sparse leaves the Dogon gather to make nja , a mushy leaf stew . At the foot of the cliff , thorn trees studded the endless plain , now yellow with the stubble of millet . Crisscrossing sandy paths led beyond the horizon to the villages of Yougodogorou , Bamba , Ibi , and Yenndouma . We pushed on to Yenndouma , where two months before I had attended the Sigui festival , a ritual held in each village every 60 years to honor Amma , the Dogon 's god and creator , and a varied company of ancestors. * Then the marketplace at the base of the cliff had been alive with dancers . Hundreds of men and boys in dark pants , yellow beads , and white cotton caps with red tassels filed singing into the marketplace , circling with shuffling steps the three silk-cotton trees in the center . A select few older men recited in Sigui , the secret language used only on sacred occasions . " Fill Our Hands With Wives .... " As night fell , the dancers wound toward the cliff village ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amma : Fill our hands with wives Fill our hands with children Fill our hands with millet Fill our hands with sorghum .... But now Yenndouma had returned to normal . Goats grazed in the marketplace . In the village everyone worked to prepare for the rainy months ahead . Water pots and baskets , straw roofs and rain gutters , hoes and axes had to be made ready . For during the June-toOctober rains , the season of cultivation , no time could be spent away from the fields . Dimon , the 50-year-old chief of Yenndouma , welcomed me and led me to a one-room mud house at the foot of the cliff , mine to use as long as I stayed . He wore a flowing blue cotton tunic over the baggy trousers that Dogon men tailor from homespun cotton . Unusually tall and thin , Dimon bore himself with the authority of a man whose father and brother had been chief before him . Today the central government reinforces his hereditary position and pays him a salary . In return , Dimon and other village chiefs help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slowly in Dogon Land Like most Dogon , Dimon clings to traditional ways , despite the pressures of living in a Moslem land and the Christianizing efforts of American missionaries in Sanga . His wealth permits him to support two wives ; trying out the English he had learned as a young man working in Ghana , he introduced me to them and to his children , and showed me the compound where they live . The rude mud houses formed an unbroken circle around a rocky courtyard . The largest held the kitchen , the sleeping room , and a passageway with a notched ladder to the roof , where the family sleeps during the hot dry months . Several smaller buildings with strawthatched roofs held grain . Dimon explained that he had two types of granaries . " At the end of each harvest I give my wives a portion of the millet , the sorghum , the rice , and the beans . They keep this in their granaries and feed the family with it during the dry season . " Dimon stores the rest of the harvest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the rains come , I open one granary and give millet to my wives to prepare . " The unused grain is kept from season to season as insurance against crop failure . A wealthy man may have ten granaries , their wooden doors sealed with mud plaster and the grain inside sprinkled with ashes as protection against insect damage . The other houses of Yenndouma were similar to Dimon 's . One had a dark rocky kitchen cut into a cave . Here I came upon an old woman kneeling by a fire and stirring a milky white  | mixture of crushed millet and water . She handed me a gourd brimming with the thick porridge-like punu that the Dogon drink for one of their two daily meals . " Drink more ! " she protested when I took only a polite sip . " You are too thin . You could never work in the fields of millet as we Dogon do . You need to eat so you will be strong . " It was my first clash with the cultural values of the Dogon . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliff climbing , but in Dogon eyes I was scrawny and useless , too weak for the work expected of even a lazy wife . The women 's day began early . Before sunrise they filed past my house , already returning from the water hole ( page 431 ) . Each managed a smile and a greeting while deftly balancing a clay pot with some 40 pounds of water on her head .  | " Aga po ? good morning , " they called out . n the shrill voice the Dogon find feminine . " Aga poi good morning to you all , " was nn- sleepy response . " Peace stay with you until evening . " " AYld with you . " . " How are you ? " " I am well . " " How is your family ? " " They are well . " " How is your health ? " ( Literally , " How is your skin ? " ) " It is well . " Then it was my turn to inquire after their well-being . With the judicious use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get through the entire , unvarying ritual before the last woman had filed out of earshot . During thesedry months , the women spent the day gathering firewood , making pots , pounding millet , preparing meals , spinning cotton , tending children , and perhaps helping their husbands with a cash crop of onions . In the planting season they would toil beside the men , sowing millet from dawn to dusk . Their spirits stay high the year round , and they groom themselves with care . Each morning the lovely daughter of Yenndouma 's chief brought a pot of water to my tiny house . Sanu 's skin glistened with the sa oil she had applied after her morning bath , and the single amber bead caught round her neck with a leather thong gleamed in the sun 's first rays . When she was older , she would line her ears with a dozen aluminum earrings and perhaps pierce her lower lip for a slender aluminum ring . Sanu was not more than 14 and not yet married . Soon a young man five or six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditional gifts . " What is the first gift ? " I asked Diangouno . " Before anything else , the young man brings  | two loads of firewood to the mother of the girl . Later he will bring a basket full of millet with 80 tiny cowries on top . More gifts will follow , and when the last are given , the couple is considered married . " The Dogon have no formal marriage ceremony , and not until a couple 's second child is born will the wife go to live with her husband permanently . Divorce is easy for women as well as for men , and a man may take more than one wife if he can afford to . Diangouno 's mention of the cowries surprised me . Centuries ago such shells , from islands in the Indian Ocean ( see pages 420-21 ) , crossed the Sahara with camel caravans to become West Africa 's most common currency . Under colonialism , francs and shillings largely replaced the shells . But in isolated Sanga as late as 1940 a measure of millet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , sold for 80 cowries . Thus , the symbolic marriage gift of 80 shells once had economic meaning . " Sold " Into Slavery for a Shell I asked Diangouno whether there were any other surviving uses of the cowrie shell , and he told me the story of his name . " Diangouno means slave of the leatherworker . ' " When I looked puzzled , he continued . " I was my mother 's tenth child , but all before me had died . She feared that all the children she bore were doomed to die young . So , before I was born , mother sold ' me to the leatherworker for a single cowrie shell . " Throughout my childhood I never worked a day for the leatherworker . I lived with my mother , who raised me carefully . When I was fully grown , we went together to the leatherworker to thank him for his protection and to return the cowrie shell that had fooled fate . But even today I am called the slave of the leatherworker . ' " Children 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisest , man in the area , the hogon . Confined to the village by tradition , Kire , hogon of Yenndouma , received visitors in the narrow entrance to his compound . When men came with problems , Kire would chase away the curious women and children , tuck his tiny frame into a recess in the passageway , and listen . Often as not , he reached into the lizardskin bag that was always at his side and pulled out a few polished stones , a bead or two , perhaps some cowries . With this simple equipment and the skill learned from his father , Kire could choose a newborn 's name , predict the future , or diagnose a disease . He was as well known for his treatments as for his powers of prediction , but he balked when I asked him to share his wisdom of the barks and leaves and herbs . " Tell you my medicine ? Then no one would come to me ! Everyone knows the trees of the plateau and the bushes of the plain , but they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how will I eat ? " In former times , an assistant to the hogon sounded a ram 's horn on the eve of market day . Now the people need no reminder . Each fifth day the market comes to Yenndouma . Women of the Fulani tribe , the old enemy of the Dogon , come from the plains to sell milk . Enterprising young men walk the 85 miles from Mopti with razor blades and matches , sugar and store-bought cloth . They return with onions and strips of the homespun cotton that the Dogon men weave . 442 National Geographic , March 1969  | On the far side of the market Yenndouma men slaughter and barbecue goats , conducting a brisk open-air restaurant trade . But only men eat here ; meat is a rare treat for Dogon women . I therefore felt greatly privileged when the men asked me to share a goat leg ( very tough ) . The market is the heart of the famous " bush telegraph . " The men , comfortably seated on the roots of an old silk-cotton tree , take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an occasional thought-provoking pinch of snuff or a crunch on a cola nut , they swap the news and gossip of the cliffs ( opposite ) . Tomorrow would be Sanga ibe , market day at Sanga , and the news of Yenndouma would travel with the merchants . And Yenndouma would receive all the latest news of the other villages upon the return of the mobile market five days hence . Goats Have a Taste for Dogon School My house lay between the marketplace and the government school . Each morning boys , and sometimes girls , walked four or five miles to their sun-baked mud desks to learn to read Mamadou et Bineta , the Malian equivalent of Dick and Jane , a French text about Moslem children . All other lessons were also conducted in French , the official language of the republic . Though Yenndouma 's school , like many in Mali , was made of mud bricks , one classroom had walls of straw , and each evening before going home the children ringed it with thorny acacia branches to keep out foraging goats . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shots broke the dark silence . Round after round rang out as men came to dance and shoot off their flintlock guns on the roof of the house of an old man who had died and been buried in the cliffs the previous week . At dawn I joined the mourners . A group of old women sang in the dead man 's courtyard , beating great hollow gourds and shaking the dried , seed-filled fruit of the baobab tree . They continued through the morning while friends filed in to offer condolences and the traditional gifts of millet and monkey bread ( the common name for baobab fruit ) . On the roof of the house the younger women began a slow deliberate dance . The pace quickened toward evening when the mourners converged on the village square . The women , bunched at the entrances to the square , drummed on gourds and swished fly whisks to dolorous rhythms . Then , from every corner of the village , men came shouting and brandishing flintlocks , crafted by the village blacksmith and crammed with homemade powder . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unforgettable send-off . Noise , sparks , and sulphur fumes filled the air as a mock battle was staged in the dead man 's behalf . Holding guns at arm 's length , the men raced across the square to engage imaginary enemies . Groups advanced and retreated , making mock lunges at the other mourners with guns and spears . For most of an hour the battle raged , until participants , daylight , and gunpowder were all exhausted . The rugged beauty of the funeral reinforced my desire to see the dama ceremony that follows the funeral of an important man . Held a year or more later , the dama is a second funeral in which dancers put on huge wooden masks , bid a final farewell , and commend the dead man 's soul to the ancestors . Hunter Awaits a Musical Cue I heard through the bush telegraph of a dama to be held at Idieli , a village 19 miles southwest of Yenndouma , in honor of a village elder who had died the previous year . When I arrived in Idieli , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village square in a wide undulating circle , their fiber skirts swinging . All were men , but their masks and costumes mimed both men and women , as well as birds and beasts . Half a dozen kanaga dancers , men in masks topped by the outstretched arms of Amma , swung into line in front of me . Now they began a series of great swooping arcs . Three , four times they circled , swept down to touch the ground with Amma 's creating hands , and then soared up again . Soon dannane , the hunter , would take his turn . He waited , crouching , his ocher tunic  | trailing on the ground . He listened for danna boy , the drum rhythm of the hunter , indelibly associated with this dancer in the minds of the Dogon . When the drums took up the rhythm , the hunter began his slow , loping dance . Head down , he stalked an imaginary victim . The menacing glances he cast at the audience made me pity the prey ( below ) . I recoiled from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fringed with a beard of ocher raffia . Triangular eyes gaped beneath the bulging forehead ; haphazand ivory pegs crammed the chiseled mouth . I thought of the warning that Diangouno had given me : " If a woman gets too close to the masks , the spirit of the masks may possess her . She falls sick . She starts to cry , to dance , and to sing the songs of the masks . " The Dogon women , their blue homespun wrap-around skirts festively accented with beads and trade-cloth scarves , watched the ceremony from a safe distance ( preceding pages ) . Only because I was not a Dogon was I permitted to stand at the edge of the arena and to approach the powerful masks . The festivities con tinued for three days . Masked dancers representing rabbits , antelopes. and caricatures of humans , sometimes on stilts . joined the huge cast of characters bidding farewell to the elder 's soul . Each man had carefully crafted his own costume from the simple materials available . Each had colored his fiber skirt with dye squeezed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acacia . Buttons , shells , and a few Malian francs adorned the green fiber headdress of a man who , with the help of black wooden falsies , posed as a woman of the neighboring Fulani tribe ( below ) . A white shirt and a folding camp chair identified another dancer as a European . The dancer of greatest skill and strength wore the sirige mask , and he needed both . Carved from a single tree , the sirige mask , 15 feet high , represents a many-storied house . Cliffs formed the backdrop as the sirige dancer mimed the daily motion of the sun . He knelt , bracing for the tremendous strain , and slowly drew an arc in the sky with the enormous mask . With the sun thus represented , the Dogon cosmos was complete . The soul could be at rest in the spirit world . Dogon masks , as well as statuettes , rank high among the African sculpture that excited and influenced such painters as Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque early in this century .

Tobacco Juice Cures a " Broken " Foot Early on the second day of the dama , I was jumping from rock to rock , trying to keep up with the kanaga dancers as they snaked through Idieli 's narrow lanes to the public square . Suddenly a loose rock gave way beneath my weight and fell back onto my left foot . While two men came to lift it off , images of the tiny foot bones smashed into hundreds  | of still-tinier pieces flashed through my mind . As the day progressed , the pain grew . By late afternoon it was so intense that Diangouno insisted I see the village " curer . " Domno 's house was like the other mud houses of Idieli . Several women pounded the evening 's millet in one corner , and half a dozen chickens pecked out a meal from chaff that had fallen to the dirt floor . Because it was a special occasion , Domno 's wife had made millet beer and the courtyard was full of men talking and sharing a gourd of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I took off my shoe and tendered my foot for Domno 's inspection . " Ssppt ! " Before I had time to react , Domno had spat on my foot and was carefully rubbing the tobacco-stained saliva across my instep . Scarcely had I recovered from the initial shock when Domno took aim a second time with equal accuracy . What madness had led me to put myself in the hands of this unsanitary back-country healer in a home-dyed ocher tunic , instead of an M.D. in spotless medical whites ? Yet how could I walk two days to the nearest clinic ? Before I could follow my thoughts further , Domno gave my foot a yank , and I shrieked . Reassuringly , Diangouno translated Domno 's diagnosis : " Mademoiselle , your foot is not broken . " " Sspppt ! " A third time Domno spat on my foot , turned it over , and casually directed , " Wait a minute before you stand on it . " I stood up , expecting a stab of pain . Miraculously the pain was gone . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gave Domno the standard fee of 50 francs ? 10 cents ? and thought of the rates charged by a New York specialist for X-rays and an office visit . Late next day I started the long walk back to Sanga , stopping to spend the night atTirelli . I lay awake a long time , gazing at the Southern Cross and at the improbable shapes of the straw-roofed granaries etched against the moonlit sky . Who knew when I would return to this whimsical land of masked men and fortunetelling foxes ? When would I again see my Dogon friends ? But that I will return , I am sure . For before leaving Yenndouma , I asked Kire to consult the fox . And speaking this time through Kit-6 's stones and shells , the fox once again predicted that I would return to the Cliffs of Bandiagara. 448
