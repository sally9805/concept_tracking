What was remarkable in Algiers last week was the absence of gunfire . Contrary to predictions , the trial of Raoul Salan , in which the S.A.O . leader 's life had been spared , did not incite his followers to greater violence . For several days not a single Moslem was shot down in the streets by S.A.O . terrorists . The mortars that usually lobbed shells into the Casbah were silent . No booby-trapped autos exploded in the midst of Moslem crowds . Instead , there was the crackling of flames as the S.A.O . put to the torch the Europeans ' own schools , public buildings and farms . The new policy was called Operation 1830 , in memory of the year the French colonization of Algeria began . Its announced purpose : to reduce the country to the state in which the French found it more than a century ago . In fact , the scorched-earth policy seemed to be designed to force a kind of truce between the S.A.O . and Algeria 's Moslems . <P> Real Dialogue . With S.A.O . permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into contact " with the F.L.N. The S.A.O . secret transmitter broke into regular radio programs with the statement : " Peace can return to this land only on condition that all those who consider Algeria as their real homeland agree among themselves . " The S.A.O . announcer sneered that De Gaulle and France were no longer important since , after Algerian independence , they were " going away . " The real dialogue should be between the S.A.O . and the F.L.N. as a means of " giving back to all Algerians a homeland , of bringing back fraternity and peace , and of making Algeria the foremost power of Africa . " <P> The S.A.O . turnabout stems partly from the fact that the terrorists now hate De Gaulle even more than they hate the Moslems . But it is also a tacit admission that Algrie Franaise is dead , and that the S.A.O . terror campaign , which slew an average of 1,000 Moslems a month , failed of its major purpose-to incite a racial bloodbath in Algeria that would force the French army to defy De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> It may also reflect a sharp difference of opinion within the S.A.O . itself . The S.A.O . leadership is largely composed of French-born ex-officers and extreme right-wing politicians to whom Algeria is only a weapon in their attempt to oust De Gaulle and capture power in France . The bulk of the S.A.O . rank-and-file sympathizers , however , are pieds-noirs who have always hoped somehow to remain in Algeria . Apparently they are finally recognizing that their hope can be realized only through a deal with the F.L.N. <P> Close Contacts . What at least some S.A.O . leaders now want is new guarantees for Europeans ' safety and property , made directly to the S.A.O . rather than to the French government . Officially , the F.L.N. and the S.A.O . denied they were speaking to each other . But at the local level there were increasing contacts between the two communities . At week 's end , in the Algiers suburb of Belcourt , 200 Europeans filed into a movie theater under the protection of Moslem militants to ask questions of an F.L.N. captain about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with only a single dissent , the Europeans voted a motion of confidence " in the Algeria of tomorrow .
