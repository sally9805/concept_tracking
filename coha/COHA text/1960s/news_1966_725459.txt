txt On Fifth Avenue yesterday afternoon , a 6-year-old girl pulled a rabbit around on a leash , a poodle wearing a wrist watch and red nail polish was paraded by its owner , and a woman smuggled a cat named Nebuchadnezzar into St. Patrick 's Cathedral to be blessed ? all in celebration of Easter . Inside the dim cathedral , before the golden high altar banked with expanses of forsythia and azaleas , women in bright hats and men in new suits knelt quietly for a moment , gazing at the uncovered Crucifix and the flowers . In the observance , Easter in the city is an amalgam of the outlandish and the reverent , the fashionable and the tawdry , the cheap and the joyous . But ail are agreed that it is somehow different from other days , marking the beginning of another cycle in the yearly round . A Day That 's Different In his untidy office yesterday during a pause between services at St. Mark's-in-theBouwerie Episcopal Church on Second Avenue , the Rev. J. C. Michael Allen put the matter this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congregation that is a remnant of the faithful . Christmas is la secular event and you get all the sentimentalists  --  the Santa Claus crowd  --  who are I very hard to preach to . But Easter is different . Then you get the lapsed Christians , people who in soem manner want to cope with life , who want to share the joy of renewal and resurrection . You ca n't quite sentimentalize Easter . " The Easter observances in the city were not reflected in the relatively small fraction of people-165,000 , according to one estimate ? who milled around under cloudy skies on Fifth Avenue yesterday . Perhaps Father Allen 's day at his once - elegant , 171 - year - old church was more typical . The 38-year-old priest recalled the " enormous depression " he felt as Holy Week -- which traces the Passion and Crucifixion of Jesus -- wore on . On Saturday . he said . he addressed a group in the last of a series of Lenten devotions entitled " God is Dead ? Praise the Lord " and felt the " despair and spiritual heaviness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom has dropped out , " Father Allen .8141 went on . " It 's something you keep getting caught up in every year . " On Saturday night he sat down in the dilapidated rectory changed . " I ca n't quite explain it , " he said , " but it is as if hope has arrived . You suddenly feel that maybe life will break out , maybe the tomb will be broken . " He wrote his sermon on the joy of life . " Easter Sunday is meaningless twaddle unless the people have something to be happy about , " Father Allen said . Yesterday morning the priest arose at 6:15 and worked on his sermon . The city looked different to him . " Three weeks ago it wls hard to believe there would be green again , but now you see the possibility of it , " lie said . " But you also , of course , have to cope with the autumn . In my sermon I comment on the beauty of the flowers at the altar , and then say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not just be a spring festival . " ' Happening ' Happens Father Allen preached at the 8 A.M. and 10:30 services and lin between talked with a group of parishioners who were enthusiastic about a sunrise " happening " they had seen earlier in Washington Square Park . The event , sponsored by the Judson Memorial Church , featured a girl cutting a young man 's hair , a woman washing diapers and.men playing a harp , trumpet and trombone . It closed with an Easter hymn . One participant said it was not so much a religious service as a celebration of life . In the afternoon , Father Allen had a dinner of roast lamb with his wife , their three children and friends . He did not go to the parade . The crowd for the parade began gathering on Fifth Avenue between 48th and 51st Streets about 11 A.M. By 11:30 the sidewalks were impassable and at 11:40 the avenue between 57th and 46th Streets was closed to traffic . The crowd surged out onto the street and those who were new to the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misnomer . It was originally a parade of fashions that churchgoers showed off on their way home from Easter services , but very few of the fashionable attend any more . Consequently the participants really have nothing to do but mill around to look at one another and snap one another 's pictures . Their thirst for sensation , however , was . boundless , although rarely slaked . Anyone with an unusual hat or anyone who chose to put clothes on his dog was immediately mobbed , and even a reporter who was jotting down a note in his notebook drew a crowd . It 's Only a Paper Dress The first arrival to cause a stir was Carolyn Hester , the folk singer , who wore a dazzling black-and-white op art dress made of paper . She shivered frequently . Next came Xavier Cugat , the bandleader , with his latest prot  --  g ? , a striking young Spanish entertainer who says her name is just Charo . She wore a leopard-skin coat and knee-length black boots . They stood on the bottom step of St. Patrick 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue . the lobby of the Plaza Hotel was heavy with perfume as women in furs and their escorts arrived for a fashionable Easter luncheon . The organ in the Palm Court played " Some Sunday Morning , " competing with the tinkling of silver and glasses . The Rev. John Raymond Vann , a sidewalk preacher who turns up at the parade annually in a silk tophat , was calling on the crowd to repent . " Some of you are going to die with a cocktail in your hand , " the preacher screamed , waving an American flag he carried slung over his shoulder . " Some of you are going td die with a cigaratte in your hand . Oh , you crazy fools . I 'm going to die with a Bible in my hand . " Just before the parade petered out at 2 P.M. and , the avenue was reopened to traffic , the crowd 's desire to see something  --  anything -- appeared to grow . More than a hundred people pressed close around Miss Jennelle Madison , who described herself as a model . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an orange basket . At the fringe of the crowd this conversation occurred among three tourists : Woman ? " What 's happen-ing ? " Man ? " Do n't know . Something close to the ground . " Second Man ? " It 's a dog in a basket " Woman ? " Really ? " Second Man ? " Yes . An orange basket " Woman ? " Oh , basket . , I thought you said bathtub. "
