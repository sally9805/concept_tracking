Even though he took over the G.O.P. 's front-running position months ago , Barry Goldwater was still nervous about the sound of footsteps behind him . " God knows , " he complained , " I have n't sought this position . I 'm still wishing something would happen to get me out of all this . It 's all a little frightening . " <P> Barry felt beleaguered . " Sometimes , he said , " I wonder why we ought to even bother with an announcement . If we say I 'm going to run , everybody will just say that 's no news . Rockefeller 's announcement sure fell with a thud . And if I say I 'm not going to run , I d better get out of the country first . " <P> Appearing at a Better Business Bureau banquet in Chicago , Goldwater told 1,800 people that " I have my political hat on tonight . " Then he laced into the Kennedy Administration , saying that the New Frontier has produced " 1,026 days of wasted spending , wishful thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The alliteration was admirable , but Barry proved once again that he delivers a formal speech with woeful woodenness . <P> Still , he is wonderful in the give and take of press conferences and other question-and-answer occasions . And in these , he seems to recover all the confidence he has lost during more stilted sessions . Asked last week about all the criticisms of his conservative views , Barry replied like the old Barry . " If they want Goldwater , " he said , " they 're going to have to take him the way I am . I 'm not going to change my spots . "
