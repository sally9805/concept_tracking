In Boston last week , silver-haired , short-tempered Patrick Benedict McGinnis , 58 , bowed out as head of a Class I U.S. railroad for the fourth time in ten years . But in surrendering his job as chief executive of the 127-year-old Boston &; Maine , the hotspur of U.S. railroading at least set a refreshing precedent . On previous occasions-aboard the Norfolk Southern , the Central of Georgia and the New Haven-McGinnis was tossed out by angry stockholders . At the B. &; M. he decided to move up to chairman on his own hook . <P> Ostensibly for health reasons , McGinnis is turning the B. &; M. presidency over to Vice President Daniel A. Benson , 47 , a tough , savvy operating railroader who began as a New Haven yard clerk . " I do n't have any heart trouble . I do n't have any ulcers , " says McGinnis . " But I 've been working twelve-hour days . I 'm slowing down before something happens . ' ' Of considerably more concern , however , is the state of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road 's financial picture has been improving : " In railroads , we measure the best by who 's doing the least bad . We had less deficit last year $3.279.716 than the seven other East Coast railroads . ' ' But under a 1960 refinancing arrangement , the B. &; M. also has $47,014,700 in first-mortgage bonds coming due between now and the end of 1965 . Unless funds are found to retire them-or the due date is postponed-the end of the line is in sight . <P> The only solution McGinnis sees to the B. &; M. 's troubles is a merger , and he is moving over to chairman-at a $44,000 salary cut-to put all his time , and his experience as a longtime Wall Street expert on bankrupt railroads , into finding one . McGinnis would first like to merge the B. &; M. with the Delaware &; Hudson , with which it connects , and then with the booming Norfolk &; Western . This arrangement would eliminate much of the $7,000,000 a year that the B. &; M .. as a terminal line , pays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , that his merger proposals are still " at a very informal stage , " and on Wall Street last week some of his old colleagues did not seem to share his confidence in the Boston &; Maine 's future . " I think a swift breeze could take them right off the diving board , " said one metaphor mixer . " McGinnis is probably abandoning a sinking ship . "
