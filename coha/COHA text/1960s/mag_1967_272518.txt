For weeks last October , Air Force crews tried to test-fire their Minuteman II intercontinental ballistic missile at its silo in Grand Forks , N. Dak . On each of three attempts , its systems control light went red-meaning that the elaborate three-stage bird was unable or unsafe to fire . First it was a failure of a nozzle-control unit , then a glitch in a fail-safe arming circuit , then a guidance failure traced to a tiny capacitor . <P> Minuteman II has been flashing its red light with disconcerting frequency . The nation 's most advanced operational ICBM , with a 7,500-mile range and a deadly megaton warhead , it has performed with 94.9% of maximum efficiency when test-fired under demonstration conditions at Cape Kennedy and other ranges . But when mounted in launching silos across the nation , sitting underground and waiting indefinitely for action , it develops minute but dangerously incapacitating problems . <P> Bugs in Components . Of the 1,000 Minutemen deployed in the U.S. , 750 are the five-year-old shorter-range ( 6,300 miles ) Minuteman I missiles . Thus , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the nation 's ICBM capability is seriously reduced . Minuteman II , when functioning perfectly , has range , flexibility and speed ( about 30 min. to any target in Russia or China ) unmatched by Minuteman I , the Navy 's Polaris missiles ( range : 2,875 miles ) or , of course , intercontinental bombers . Currently , 40% of the Minuteman Us are not operational or not on alert because of malfunctions , leaving the nation comparatively naked to a Communist ICBM attack . <P> <P> Many of the Minuteman II guidance systems , designed and built by North American Aviation 's Autonetics Divi sion , have been returned to the factory for repair . Their ultra-subminiature integrated circuitry is still at best temperamental . Eventually , Air Force Secretary Harold Brown maintained last week , Minuteman II , only two years old and still evolving , will mature into a reliable vehicle . In the meantime , as the U.S. relies upon an overwhelming ICBM offensive to keep the Russians strategically in check , the failures of Minuteman II remain a dangerous flaw in the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive anti-ballistic missile system to defend the nation 's cities against a possible attack by enemy missiles , the U.S. has relied to date on an offensive system whose devastating retaliatory capabilities would , presumably , deter the enemy from attacking in the first place . The present U.S. arsenal should indeed give any aggressor pause . It consists of the 1,000 Minuteman Is and IIs , 54 Titan IIs and 656 Polaris missiles , as well as 555 B-52 and 80 B58 intercontinental bombers armed to unload nuclear bombs on any enemy in the world-although some 60 B-52s are now based on Guam and in Thailand to fly conventional missions over North Viet Nam . <P>
