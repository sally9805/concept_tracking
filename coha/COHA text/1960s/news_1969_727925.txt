txt Big-city mayors must sometimes wonder whether Henry Ford did the world such a good turn when he came up with assembly lines capable of turning out cars by the millions . For one of the fastest-growing problems for many cities is abandoned cars that clutter streets in residential neighborhoods and blight the landscape along urban freeways . " A derelict car hurts a street and a neighborhood in countless ways , " says Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York . " It 's the worst sort of eyesore . It attracts car strippers and vandals . It collects dirt and refuse . It becomes a dangerous playground for children . Narcotics addicts use it for a shooting gallery , and tramps use it as a flophouse . " Mr. Lindsay and community leaders in other cities across the country say the most troubling aspect of the " junker " problem is that so far it has defied solution . Moreover , the problem threatens to get much worse , for the scrap heap is growing faster than it can be removed or destroyed . A Symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars were junked , all but 400,000 autos were consumed by industry for steel-making . In 1968 , however , some two million car hulks remained to be disposed of alter industry 's needs had been met . In Mr. Lindsay 's view , the growing Junk pile is " a symbol of an affluent society and a wasteful society  --  a society that is barely able to control its own environment . " Many of the worthless junkers are abandoned at the curb in poor neighborhoods , sometimes by outsiders who bring jalopies in from other sections of town . That 's apparent in an area such as Detroit 's Fifth Precinct , a low-income , largely black neighborhood . On many blocks there , two or three abandoned cars sit at curbside or in vacant lots . Often the wheels are missing and the windows smashed . Some are burned-out hulks . Through last month , Detroit police hauled 1,437 abandoned cars out of the Fifth , up 37% from two years ago . Trying to keep up with the junkers " is like trying to sweep back water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Lindsay says that New York hauled away 21,500 abandoned cars during the first five months of this year , compared with 30,000 during all of 1968 . Mayor Alfonso Cervantes of St. Louis says : " A year ago , we rarely got a citizen 's complaint about derelict cars , but in May they accounted for 22% of the 384 complaints my office received . " More Cars on the Road Several factors are behind the explosion in abandoned cars . There are more cars on the road to wear out . Motorists are also driving more ; thus their cars wear out faster . The experts also say that cars depreciate faster these days than ever before , making their owners more likely to walk away from even a relatively late-model vehicle when it breaks down . Martin , a Detroit Chrysler-Plymouth dealer , says that 10 years ago " if you had a five or six-year-old car , you had a marketable product worth $250 or $300 . " Now , he adds , a five or six-year-old car is often worthless . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sluggish . As a result , demand for junkers has held level at about five million cars a year . But the seven million cars junked last year were up 12% from the previous year and almost 66% above 10 years ago . A switch to steel-making processes that use less scrap is one of the main reasons the scrap metal market 's consumption of junkers is no longer keeping pace with the pileup . Scrap steel from autos that brought $43 a ton in 1956 now fetches only about $20 a ton . Many scrap dealers say it costs them almost $20 to transport an old car hulk and then shred it into usable scrap , leaving a negligible profit . A few junk yard owners refuse to take old cars even when their owners offer them free . The junkmen who do take cars are often highly selective . Julius Wainer , a Detroit scrap dealer , says he 's only interested in junkers when he can make a profit selling individual parts , such as radiators . But like most dealers , Mr. Wainer only wants cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth the trouble , " he says . In some cities , including New York and St. Louis , local governments must pay most of the cost of picking up Junkers . St. Louis paid out $40,000 in the fiscal year ended last April 30 and expects to spend $100,000 in the current fist-al year . Rising insurance and auto registration costs are also contributing to the junk-car problem . " By the time a guy pays for his plates and insurance , he 's liable to wind up paying out more than his car is worth , " says a Detroit policeman . And in Missouri , where a tough new safety inspection law recently went into effect . many drivers are junking their cars when they find out that the cost of repairs necessary to get their vehicle through the inspection line will be more than the car 's market value . Even if the streets could be swept clean of abandoned cars , that would n't solve the problem . Junk yard operators would still be left with ugly mountains of old cars , sometime , covering acres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains . Proler Steel Co. of Houston has built seven giant auto shredding machines , each capable of turning 250,000 cars a year into neat chunks of scrap . The machines are now operating in various parts of the country , but they are running at less than full capacity . The catch is that the low price for scrap metal holds down the amount Proler can pay for old car hulks , which makes junk yard operators less than eager to dispose of their old car stockpiles . Maryland recently passed an auto disposal law that might make the use of such machines more feasible economically for scrap firms Beginning a year from now , the state will pay scrap processors $10 for each car they demolish . The money will come from small fees charged auto buyers . The Maryland law also provides that beginning next Jan. 1 junk yard operators will be allowed to keep cars that are seven model years old or older for a maximum of one year . After that , the wreckers face fines of $5 a car for each six-month period after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are considering . similar legislation . The Federal attack on the problem of disposing of old car hulks has been limited to research projects and to the moderately success . ful but scantily financed attempts to screen auto junk yards from public view . The screening program received no funds at all in the fiscal year now ending and is n't scheduled to get any in fiscal 1970 . The Nixon Administration , however , says it will seek funds for screening in fiscal 1971.
