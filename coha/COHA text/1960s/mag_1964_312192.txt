In Sweden and Denmark , Scandinavia 's most prosperous nations , election results last week came as a jolt to the Socialists who have ruled both countries for decades . Though Swedes voted solidly for grandfatherly Premier Tage Erlander 's Social Democrats , the big surprise of the election was a gain in Communist strength . The Reds not only added three extra seats to the five they already hold in the Riksdag 's 233-member lower house ; they were also the only party to increase their overall percentage of the popular vote . <P> Danish voters , by contrast , moved right , giving four new seats to the Conservatives . The ruling Social Democrats won 76 seats in Parliament , the same total they won in 1960 . However , their coalition partners , the Radical Liberals , dropped one of their eleven seats , thus wiping out the government 's precarious majority and forcing Premier Jens Otto Krag to form a minority administration .
