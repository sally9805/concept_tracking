txt Though it has n't been evident during the violent events of recent days , many white residents of this racially torn town have been wishing the Rev. Martin Luther King . Jr. , the best of luck in hastening action ? - , n new Federal legislation to help Deep South Negroes vote . This does n't mean the whites are particularly eager to see the barriers that have kept local Negroes from voting swept away . But they figure the strong voting-rights bill which President Johnson sends to Congress today may at least lead Mr. King to relax the pressure in Selma , giving them a chance to step in and try to resolve the issues that have turned this normally placid Alabama River town into a cauldron of seething racial tensions . ( For details of the voting-rights bill and its prospect in Congress ( see story on page 3 ) It 's true that in the past local white leaders never showed much disposition to get together with Negroes to discuss Negro grievances . Since club-swinging state troopers injured dozens of Negro demonstrators on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a growing conviction among many whites here that they must act more boldly to ease racial frictions . This conviction was heightened late last week by the death of a visiting white minister who had been beaten by white toughs . Collins Urges Conciliation Gov . George Wallace in a nationwide television appearance yesterday did not say whether he would heed President Johnson 's suggestion that he call a biracial meeting , a meeting that could help negotiate a racial truce here . The formation of teams to seek a ti uce was strongly urged last week by LeRoy Collins , head of the Community Relations Service set up under the 1964 civil rights act , during meetings with several local groups . The former Florida governor suggested that prominent residents of Selma  --  perhaps as many as 1.000 ? should issue a " statement of policy " spelling out a clear objective of racial progress . Mr. Collins said the signers should then call on Mayor Joe Smitherman to set up a " communications group " to start thrashing out the differences that have split the city during an eight-week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cities , such as Jackson and McComb , Miss . But they are expected to run into substantial opposition here . " I 'm ready to sign right now , but I wo n't be surprised if the next day the Citizens Council gets out a statement of their own with 100 more signers. " says one Selma executive . This businessman notes that . unlike many other Southern cities , the segregationist Citizens Council here has not fallen in repute to the level of the Ku Klux Klan . In Selma the council is a respected group headed by Chris B. Heinz . a real estate dealer who served as Selma 's mayor till last fall . The present mayor , Mr. Smitherman , while considered less extreme than his predecessor , is nevertheless a fervent segregationist . A close friend and avid supporter of Gov . George Wallace . he campaigned on a platform of never sitting down with a biracial committee . Like other local leaders , he has vowel never to negotiate anything with Mr. King or any other " outside agitators . " Pres ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders think they can sway the mayor . " We know the mayor 's position , and we 're not going to ask him to break any promises , - says one business leader . " But , on the other hand , he 's going to realize that if 1.000 Selma leaders ask him for help , he 's going to have to help or be a lame duck from then on . " Negro leaders say they are ready to talk any time . The organization established to spearhead their voter registration drive , the Dallas County ( Selma ) Voters League , set up a committee for this purpose some time ago . according to the Rev. Frederick D. Reese . chairman of the 16-man committee and pastor of the Macedonia Baptist Church . His group already has pinpointed " areas of concern , " ranging from the hiring of Negro policemen . firemen , bus drivers and store clerks to representation on the now all-white school board . Many Negroes feel that the mayor will be more willing to meet with a biracial group when it becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote . " We feel he 'll be much more sympathetic when he sees he ca n't be re-elected without our help . " says Mrs. Amelia Boynton. a leader of the Negro voter registration drive . Negroes account for just over half of Dallas County 's total voting-age population of 30.000. but there are only about 600 Negro voters , compared with about 9.000 whites . Risk of New Violence Neither white nor Negro leaders . however , think Selma 's racial problems will be solved either quickly or easily . There is even doubt among some that further violence can be avoided . There were some fears last night that new serious trouble might erupt this morning as Negroes again sought to register to vote at the court house here . Bearing strongly on the question of further violence is the result of the hearing , now under way in Federal court in Montgomery , on whether the temporary ban on civil rights marches should be lifted . If the court permits Mr. King to lead a civil rights protest march from Selma to Montgomery there is a risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Gov . Wallace yesterday said he would call on Alabamans to let the marchers proceed in peace . Any such confrontation would raise the question of whether the President would send in Federal troops . Should the court make the ban on demonstrations permanent . Mr. King would be put in a difficult position . The question then would arise as to whether he should work within the law as in the past . or defy the court order and thus risk further violence . It 's clear that to make any headway in solving Selma 's racial difficulties the first problem will be to reach agreement on what the problems are . Negroes see the city as a bastion of segregation , while whites claim they were bending over backward to comply with the new civil rights law when Mr. King came to town and stiffened segregationist resistance . One thing becomes evident after chats with dozens of white and Negro citizens  --  the original goal of Negro voter registration is often forgotten or obscured . Talk with Negro demonstrators standing in a downpour under a huge plastic sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tell you-they are after " freedom . " As for the whites , many of them see the attempts to march on the Dallas County courthouse as a plot to further " the Communist conspiracy . " Yesterday Gov . Wallace said he thought Communists had infiltrated civil rights groups . " Freedom  --  I want to be able to go where I want and do what I want and say what I want , " says Leather Mae Stover. a Negro teenager and business administration student at Selma University , who claims she was roughed up in the Sunday rout . What about voted discrimination ? " I do n't know about that ? I 'll find out when I get old enough to vote , " says Miss Stover . " Selma has been picked as a showcase , " says retired Buick dealer Arthur J. Lewis . " They are using us to get Federal laws passed because they decided Selma was the best setting . It 's an aristocratic old town which is on the threshold of industrial growth , and it was vulnerable because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all for the Negroes , " adds another Selma white , " we had Sheriff Jim Clark , an ideal symbol of the segregationist South for Dr. King , and he 's played right into the demonstrators ' hands . " Whether voter discrimination exists in Selma is a hotly debated point . Negroes say it does , despite a Federal court order last month aimed at wiping it out . But Gov . Wallace this weekend told the President that qualified Negroes have no trouble voting in Alabama and " voter registration and voting rights are not the issues involved in the street demonstrations " in Selma . " There 's not a Negro here who ca n't go down there and get registered if he 's qualified , " insists George A. Swift , operator of a drug store on Broad Street and a city council member . Col. Joseph R. Bibb , one of three members of the Board of Registrars , agrees . " You tell me what all this Negro business in Selma is all about , " he says . " I ca n't follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the Negroes voting in Selma . Ala . I tell you that any person of any color who meets the requirements of a legally prescribed test is registered indiscriminately. ? ' CoL Bibb points out that the Federal order late last month set up specific registration procedures and banned use of a test which baffled many college graduates . The only test now , he says . is one calling only for biographical data . " You 've got to be a graduate of Harvard University in order to find some way to fail the test . It 's so simple . " he insists . The Federal Court ordered that at least 100 voter applicants be processed each registration day  --  the first and third Mondays each month  --  and that any not processed by July 15 be acted upon by a Federal voting referee . Applicants are allowed to get on a waiting list simply by signing their name at the courthouse any business day . Each applicant is given a number . At first Negroes boycotted the waiting list and demanded that registration be open every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days , however , they decided to sign , and the list quickly grew to more than 2,500 names . When registration day rolled around two weeks ago , the entire list was called , but only 266 applicants answered , all of whom were processed . The registrars refuse to say , however , how many of the 266 were approved and how many rejected . In the past two weeks leading up to registration day today , only 122 more names were added to the waiting list . Last week only eight applicants signed up , and six of those were whites . The numbers of those who did n't show up two weeks ago will be called again today , and if they are not present will be dropped , the registrars say . Negroes charge that the registration system is still unfair . For one thing , they insist , Sheriff Clark rattles off numbers in a rapid staccato which makes it hard to respond before the applicant is passed over . In addition , they say , the test is still too hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often find the questions asking for information on their background complex and difficult to answer . The qualifications for voting , insist the Negroes , should be limited largely to age and residence .
