 | Impatient Spring 0 rdINARILY , our old maple tree is fairly well behaved . So I was quite unprepared on that February day when it hissed at me . " Ps-s-s-t ! " it said . Puzzled , I stared at it . Now I could see that something was taking place . Half a dozen chickadees were attacking a huge flake of bark on the trunk . I waded through the snow to the maple , and in those few feet I walked from winter into spring . The part of the trunk that attracted the chickadees was broadside to the rays of the morning sun . Warmed by this heat , hundreds of cluster flies had stirred from their winter bed beneath the bark , and now they were pushing and shoving their way out into the sunshine . Every so often one would buzz its wings briefly . The loose bark , acting  | as a sounding board , magnified the noise : ps-s-s-s-t ! The chickadees , of course , were giving them a hungry welcome . For nearly two hours the banquet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunk . With the coming of shade , the flies slipped back into winter . And the chickadees returned to the bird feeder . Such little tastes of spring make it hard to say , really , when the new season actually does begin . The calendar gives one date . The groundhog and his shadow foretell another . Countless little clues ? like flies that can not wait ? give still others . One of the first spring flowers , for instance , may have already been waiting for those same buzzing flies . That flower is the peculiar , purplestriped cup of the skunk cabbage , first cousin of the jack-in-the-pulpit and of the philodendron on your windowsill . Some time in late winter , a hidden impulse triggers the skunk cabbage into life . The roots , buried six inches or more beneath the soil along a stream or marsh , begin to convert their stored food into energy . Forcing its way through frost and snow , the growing bud surges upward . Having risen aboveground , the skunk cabbage now proceeds to demonstrate how it got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smells . " Little glands in the tissues produce a powerful odor . Wafted by the breeze , the odor calls flies , restless beetles and other wakening insects . Landing on the plant 's pollen-laden center , they optimisticall search for what smells like a garbage heap , and in the process they fc tilize the curious blossom . Thus i gets a running start on spring , whi less-venturesome flowers are sti underground . The same moist ground that bea skunk cabbages may yield oth spring hopefuls . Walk near almo any brook or stream on a mild win ter day . The chances are you wi find a creature that insists on livin life backward . Creeping over th snow , its slender , dark body absor ing heat from the slanting sun , th winter stone fly ? a half-inch insect with wings it seldom uses ? is near- ' ing the end of its existence . For months it has been a flattened nymph clinging to the bottom of its stream . Now , instead of waiting for another warm summer , it pokes its way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge , seeking another of its kind . If it is successful , it may mate , lay its eggs and die before the ice has left its river . The February sun is a heat lamp to many creatures besides the winter , stone fly : spiders that creep over the surface of the snow as if in a dream , little brown caterpillars called from their grass-roots slumbers ; wingless crane flies walking on their long legs over the honeycombed snow . You might even be treated to the improbable sight of a butterfly . The mourning cloak , decked in heat-absorbent brown , red and blue , has stirred from its hollow tree . Now it flits to a broken maple twig and samples " ' be IMPATIENT SPRING 121  | a drop of sap . As soon as the sun wanes , it goes back to its tree house . As the days lengthen , more harbingers appear . The skunk , stirring Horn its underground den , pokes ound in search of venturesome insects , old apples or ? opportunist that it is ? a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear yawns and stretches . Having stuffed innards with pine needles and ther debris , it feels no need for food - but takes a little walk anyway , as much out of curiosity as anything Ise . Then it returns for a few more weeks of slumber , like a man who vakens and resets the alarm clock or 40 more winks . Even the four-footed nibblers ? especially the rabbits and deer ? get a iew lease on life . While the snow was deep , it covered all of their food except what projected above the surface . Now , as the snow settles , new , wigs and buds are exposed daily . A walk in a half-grown woodlot will show the fresh marks of the rabbits . The ends of twigs are cut on a slant , for rabbits have to tilt their heads to slice with those buck teeth . The deer , having no uppers in front , twist their food from the branch , leaving the twigs frayed and splintered . Of course , the mice have been busy as well . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like a double trail of tiny footprints . Now his whole traffic pattern is shown : a maze of trails made by tireless small feet . Packed down , these trails stay longer than the softer snow around them ; sometimes they lace an entire landscape . The first stirrings of spring have a sound of their own , too . It is the time for seeking a mate , and such an important occasion deserves to be announced . As early as February , the quiet of my snowy woods may be shattered by the drumming of a downy woodpecker . This feathered riveter can speak in little more than a squawk , so he advertises his availability differently : finding a hollow tree stub with just the right resonance , he whacks away . Every bit as meaningful to the it  | ears for which they are intended are the courtship calls of other creatures : the moonlight yip of the red fox , the unearthly yowl of the bobcat , the first thumpings of the rabbit as it drums its hind feet to announce to prospective mates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their reputation . Then , too , there 's the spring song of the chickadee . All fall and early winter the little black-and-white waif has said his name over and over as he searched for food . Now , apparently cheered by the lengthening days , he bursts out in a new song : a high , sweet , two-note whistle . You can copy it almost exactly by whistling the highest note your lips can form for one second . Then drop down two tones and whistle again for one second . The chickadee 's message is clear : " Spring . . . soon . Spring ... soon . " Even while you 're shoveling your walk for the tenth time , spring can make itself known . Once the predominant color scheme was blackon-white as the bare branches stood out against the snow . Now , suddenly , you realize the colors have softened . The black is not as black . It may have a reddish tinge if you 're looking over a valley wooded maples , or a yellowish hue w the willows are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On a moderate day in late winter entire hillside may be made g as myriads of snow fleas cone , the surface to soak up the sunsh ' This odd insect , about the size color of a speck of pepper , acts I that spicy condiment come to I Cocked beneath its abdomen is taut little spring , held in place a trigger . When the trigger is leased , the tiny insect is catapul into the air . Hence its other co mon name , " springtail .
