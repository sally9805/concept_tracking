On Valentine 's Day 1950 , as Joseph Stalin and Mao Tse-tung sealed a treaty of " friendship , alliance and mutual security , " Comrade Mao predicted that this union of 700 million people would " inevitably influence the future of all mankind . " This week the tenth anniversary of that historic union was observed with determined gaiety in Peking with lectures , parades and folklore festivals . Soviet Boss Khrushchev was too busy to take part personally in these solemnities . China 's No. 1 ally was , ironically enough , off in India building friendship with China 's No. 1 rival for Asian leadership , <P> Uneasy Neighbors . If there is one proposition on which all the Western intelligence experts agree , it is that more unites the Soviet Union and Communist China than divides them . But what divides them is becoming more and more conspicuous . Ageless national conflicts are already pulling Russia and China in different directions . Under the impact of their exploding population , the Chinese are moving westward and northward into the border lands of Mongolia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <P> When Toronto 's Geophysicist J. Tuzo Wilson recently crossed the border , he found that it took five hours . After the Russians had switched the train wheels at Otpor to fit China 's narrower-gauge tracks , he reported : " The train crept forward in the dark toward the actual border . It was brilliantly floodlit . Soldiers with rifles and fixed bayonets were on guard . <P> The last Russian I saw was gazing up at the underside of the cars with a floodlight to make sure no one was riding the rods out of the workers ' paradise . <P> " The train continued creeping forward for what seemed an age . The change was complete . Three miles back , every person had been Western and every sign had been in Russian . Now everyone was Oriental and there was not a sign in any language but Chinese . We had entered the Orient as one jumps off a dock into the sea . " <P> Hard Bargains . Western specialists no longer dismiss the differences between Peking and Moscow as some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that China 's objections to Khrushchev 's policy of coexistence with the West are more tactical than strategic . <P> Russia wants peace to get on with its industrialization . China still needs outside hostility to unite a restless people . <P> In ten years the Russians have lent the Chinese the somewhat unimpressive sum of $430 million , in deals signed only after months of hard bargaining . Currently the Chinese are shipping the Russians $250 million worth of goods a year more than they receive . Still , when the Chinese proclaim loudest of all that Communist strength now exceeds Western strength , the strength they are bragging about is primarily Russia's-Sputniks and missiles .
