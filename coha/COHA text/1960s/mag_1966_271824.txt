Though he had a virus ailment , a touch of pneumonia and a 100.2 temperature , Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield left his bed at Bethesda Naval Hospital , bundled up against a chill wind , and was chauffeured to the Capitol . Mansfield had made sure in advance that other Administration stalwarts would also be on hand . As for the G.O.P. , Minority Leader Everett Dirksen warned potential no-shows : " By God , you 're going to be here . " To a man , they were . Thus , after a Dirksen-led filibuster had tied up the Senate for a total of 13 days in an attempt to thwart the Administration 's bill to repeal Section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act , the issue finally came to a vote . <P> Leading the attack on Mansfield 's petition to impose cloture , Dirksen castigated the Administration 's attempt to foist " compulsory unionism " on hundreds of thousands of U.S. workers . " The basic concept upon which the whole structure of Government rests , " he said , " is the concept of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we tarnish it , if we sully it , if we transmit it to the next generation in impaired form . " Mansfield countered with harsh words . He decried " the resentments , the irritations , the vendettas and the whatevers against organized labor " that had prompted the talkathon . Noting the Senate 's historic reluctance to restrict debate , Mansfield reasoned : " The Senate will not gag itself by voting to adopt cloture . On the contrary , if the Senate does adopt cloture , it will free itself from the passion and perversity which , since the end of the last session , have held this institution in a deadly strangle hold . " <P> Then the Senate voted . With 99 Senators on hand-Michigan Democrat <P> Pat McNamara , hospitalized for a thyroid ailment , was the only absentee- the Administration needed 66 votes to close down Dirksen 's filibuster . It remained for Hubert Humphrey , president of the Senate , to announce how far short of the mark the Administration had fallen . " On this vote , " boomed Humphrey when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 48 nays . Two-thirds of the Senators present and voting not having voted in the affirmative , the cloture motion is rejected . " Two days later Mansfield tried again ; this time the vote was 50 to 49 for cloture . Thus repeal of 14(b) was dead for this session . The bill would remain on the Senate calendar , Mansfield said , " with the inscription : R.I.P . "
