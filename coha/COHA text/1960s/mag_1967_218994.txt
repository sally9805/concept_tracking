NIGHT FALLS ON THE CITY by Sarah Gainham. 572 pages . Holt , Rinehart &; Winston . $6.95 . <P> When the major novel about the Nazi terror is written , its theme will almost certainly be not physical brutality but moral decay . Night Falls on the City merely anticipates the probability . Some of the animal savagery is there , and the death and suffering , but what is even more shameful is the almost total collapse of human decency in a highly civilized-perhaps overcivilized-society . Author Gainham knows Austria well , and the Viennese victims , fence sitters , Nazi bullyboys , happy collaborators and German overlords are all convincing enough for documentary purposes . Almost predictably , her heroine , a famous actress , has a Jewish husband , and the terrifying things that happen when she hides him in a dummy room keep a thread of suspense . <P> This is a novel that anyone who was in Austria during the war or just after it could have jotted down from ordinary conversation and observation . It captures the slow fading of Austria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It details the deportations , the mean spying for the Nazis by willing people of all classes , the fear of speaking openly , the people carted off for no known reason . Through the use of rather contrived plot coincidences , Author Gainham keeps her selected characters in view at all times , or at least until the SS and finally the Russians take care of them in their own way . Of an earlier book , Appointment in Vienna , a critic wrote that " Miss Gainham knows neither when nor how to stop . " True enough . But the steady march of moral disintegration under pressure in her chief characters shows that she knows where tragedy lies .
