Should there be a Vice President of France ? " What would one do with him ? " President Charles de Gaulle once asked loftily when the point was raised . " If he were established in a mansion , he would be called a parasite . If he stayed at home waiting , he would not be prepared for his eventual task . " <P> But last week the vice-presidential question was again being ardently debated in France . Paris newspapers headlined stories that De Gaulle-survivor of two attempts on his life-had been threatened with assassination during his visit to Washington for President Kennedy 's funeral . Whatever the real extent of De Gaulle 's danger ( the FBI indeed reports that threats came in a " deluge " of phone calls to its offices , to the Secret Service , and to police stations from New York to Dallas ) , Kennedy 's murder reopened the problem of the succession in France . <P> Crossed Neckties . Even before the assassination , the problem was on the minds of 3,000 Gaullist delegates who gathered in Nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young , forward-looking image for De Gaulle 's party . The outward trappings were fondly assumed to be l'americaine : blue-suited hostesses , party emblems , name tags for delegates , neckties imprinted with the Cross of Lorraine . After the stunning news of Kennedy 's death flashed through the meeting hall , Party Secretary Jacques Baumel noted that De Gaulle now was " one of the last great captains of the Western world . " Most delegates thereafter failed to concentrate on the endless , self-congratulatory speeches that Le Monde later called an exercise in " autosatisfaction , " instead discussed the crime and the need for a French Vice President in the American style . <P> In the U.S. , it was noted , power passed securely and quickly to a close-working associate of Kennedy , to a member of his own party and a man who had himself been an outstanding contender for the presidency . In France , under the constitution of the Fifth Republic , the successor to the President would not necessarily have any of these qualifications . <P> Double Ballot . Should De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercised by the President of the Senate , " who currently is affable Gaston Monnerville , 66 , a Negro lawyer from French Guiana and an avowed opponent of De Gaulle 's regime , which he describes as " enlightened Bonapartism. " * Within 35 days of the President 's death , according to the constitution , new elections would have to be held to pick a successor . <P> One Gaullist Deputy , Achille Peretti , is pressing for a different system . Under his plan , as in the U.S. , a Vice President would be elected at the same time as the President and " would also derive his authority directly from the nation . There would be two names on the ballot . " But in President De Gaulle 's opinion , picking a successor through new elections is better , because it would provide a leader chosen in his own right , with a full term of office before him and a firm mandate behind him . At week 's end , Charles de Gaulle let it be known that he is firmly opposed to having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second name on the ballot .
