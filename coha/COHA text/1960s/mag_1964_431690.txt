 | Footprints on the MOON @# B EFORE THE END of this decade man will launch his greatest voyage of discovery , a journey whose magnitude and implications for the human race dwarf any high adventure of the past . For the first time he will leave his home planet and set foot upon another world , the luminous satellite of earth we call the moon . Although Premier Khrushchev has said the Soviets have no target date for a flight by cosmonauts to the moon , our own national objective ? an American on the moon prior to 1970 ? remains unchanged . At this time no one can say whether the first man to make that epochal voyage will be a citizen of the United States or of the Soviet Union . But the perils will be successfully navigated ; there will be footprints in the lunar dust . By the end of this century the conquest of the moon may seem only a modest first step along the spaceways to still other-worlds . However , our natural satellite , the moon , circling earth at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target for the sixties . More than 5,000 of the Nation 's industrial firms are directly involved in United States efforts to place men on the moon . The National Aeronautics and Space Administration estimates that 20,000 companies and 300,000 people eventually will participate . In addition , all of NASA 's 10 major centers and most of its 30,000 employees now contribute to the effort . The task this Nation has set for itself will be expensive , costing an estimated 20 billion dollars . But the goal of a man on the moon is well  | within our national capability , and it can be accomplished on schedule if the necessary funds are appropriated . NASA , the agency I serve as Deputy Administrator , is entrusted with the peaceful yploration of space . Though only 51/2 years it has wrested many secrets from the - lace environment with a galaxy of un.tinned satellites , 52 by recent count . Yet , understandably , it is in the field of manned ace flight , where astronauts ' lives are at take , that we feel a special responsibility . NASA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plan Project Mercury , which ended May 16 , 1963 , with the safe return from 22 orbits of L. Gordon Cooper , Jr . The Mercury score : six manned flights and six dramatic successes . How do we propose to accomplish the which more demanding task of lunar flight ? NASA attacks the problem through ProjApollo , now well under way . Apollo 's command module , the term we apply to the @# moon spacecraft 's living quarters , will house three astronauts during the trip to and from the moon . When in orbit above the moon 's pocked face , two of the astronauts will enter a special vehicle , attached cabooselike to their command module , and descend to the lunar surface . Hours later , after taking photographs and making scientific studies , they will blast off and rendezvous above the moon with the third man , re-entering the command module for the trip home . Their special vehicle , called the lunar excursion module , or LEM , will be left behind in moon orbit . Most of the necessary components for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command module , LEM ? are under development . NASA has set for itself and its contractors a very high but realizable standard of performance : The mission must have a 99.9 percent probability for safety for the astronauts and a 90 percent chance of success . Shakespeare 's self-confident man of action , Hotspur , declares in King Henry IV , By N.H.S .  | heaven , methinks it were an easy leap to pluck bright honour from the pale-fac 'd moon .... " I have yet to meet an astronaut who would agree with him . To date the flight time in space compiled by United States astronauts totals only 53 hours , 56 minutes , and 8 seconds . Some 2,000 hours , all in earth orbit , must be accumulated before we are ready to vault to the moon . This experience and mastery of rendezvous , the joining together of two vehicles while they hurtle around the earth at 17,500 miles an hour , will be vital to success . So our next man-in-space program is not Apollo but Project Gemini , aptly named after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castor and Pollux . The Latin gemini means twins , and this second generation spacecraft will hold two astronauts seated side by side . Gemini will have the rocket power to change its orbit and maneuver , whereas the Mercury capsule , equipped with jets to control roll , pitch , and yaw , could change only its attitude . Gemini and Agena Rendezvous in Space Once it attains orbit , Gemini will overtake and attach itself to an unmanned Agena vehicle previously sent aloft . When joined to this fueled stage , the spacecraft can blast itself into a flight path that will take it farther from earth . Its oxygen system will support the men for periods as long as two weeks . A kinship between Mercury and Gemini capsules is apparent in their outward appearances , but the Gemini crew compartment is 50 percent larger in volume than Mercury 's ( opposite ) . Moreover , Gemini introduces many advances in technology . Take , for example , ease of maintenance . When a component in the old Mercury capsule became balky , technicians frequently had to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the part needing replacement . In Gemini most components are grouped in prefabricated assemblies around the sides of the spacecraft . Access is through exterior service hatches ; if a part goes bad , repairmen remove an entire package and quickly install a new one . You may never have heard of fuel cells , devices for producing electricity , but Gemini will use them instead of batteries for most of its power needs . Moreover , these ingenious cells will yield an important bonus : drinking water for the astronauts . Fuel cells of the type planned for Gemini use hydrogen and oxygen and convert the chemical energy from their reaction into useful electricity . They reverse the process of electrolysis . Instead of breaking water down into its components by passing an electric current through it , they form water in a controlled reaction that liberates electrons . Such cells are not new , but their development is just now coming of age . Those in Gemini , with their fuel , will weigh about 550 pounds , half the weight of batteries of comparable power and life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency 362 @# 363 drinking supply need be put aboard for the crew . Apollo , too , will use fuel cells . In the words of a Gemini engineer : " What a system ! It 's like carrying your own well with you on a long desert journey . " The fuel cells , plus such equipment as 16 small rocket thrusters needed for maneuverinc in space and retrorockets that bring the craft out of orbit , are housed in two sections attached behind the capsule 's heat shield . Crewmen jettison these sections and turn the capsule around before its re-entry through NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCI ET the atmosphere , blunt end first as in Mercury . The Atlas'rocket , with 360,000 pounds of thrust , hurled Mercury capsules into orbit , but the Old Faithful of those pioneering flights lacks the power for Gemini . It will require the Titan II , a booster with two rocket stages . The first develops a thrust of 430,000 pounds , equivalent at burnout velocity to more than six million horsepower , or the combined power of 32,000 medium-size American automobiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 100,000 pounds of thrust .  | One of the most critical periods from the standpoint of astronaut safety begins with launch and continues until the rocket is out of the atmosphere . Should a malfunction occur in the booster , the crew must be whisked away from it , and almost instantaneously , because it may explode . Mercury met this problem with a rocketpowered escape tower capable of pulling the capsule free for a parachute descent . In Gemini the technique is quite different . The astronauts can jettison the hatches and blow themselves and their seats out of the capsule , as they would from a jet aircraft , and descend by individual parachutes . They would do this only if an emergency occurred below 70,000 feet . Above that altitude they would free Gemini from the second-stage booster , fire Gemini 's rockets to pull away , then ride the capsule down to the ground , as in a Mercury escape , or jump when well within the atmosphere . Ejection seats , though a tried-and-true escape technique , could not be used with Mercury . Atlas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blast and fireball are characteristic of these propellants if the booster explodes . Had any done so in the Mercury program , the men would have needed the protection of their capsules . Titan II , on the other hand , burns one of the " exotic " fuels . a combination of hydrazine and unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine , with nitrogen tetroxide as the oxidizer . Their blast effect and flame would be confined to a lesser area . Thanks largely to these new propellants , the countdown for a Titan II launch is much shorter than for an Atlas . Fuel and oxidizer burn instantly on contact . This eliminates need for an ignition system . Moredver , they may be kept in the rocket without deterioration , ready for instant use In contrast , the Atlas 's liquid oxygen vaporizes and must be replenished periodically . A shortened count , increased simplicity . reliability . .. these will be mandatory for Gemini . Lift-off must be on schedule . Rendezvous requires accurate celestial marksmanship ; precise timing is all important . The mission begins when an Atlas blasts off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target vehicle into a nearly circular orbit 185 miles above the earth . About 24 hours later Agena again will approach the point east of the space center where it entered orbit .  | Now it is time for Gemini begin pursuit . Its optimum aunch window , " the interval , . hen it can take off and catch . p with the least expenditure of fuel , lasts 20 minutes . So Titan II flames from its launch pad and hurls Gemini into an elliptical orbit with an apogee , or highest point , of 185 miles and a perigee , or lowest point , id 100 miles . Much hinges on the interrelationship of these orbits . To understand why , picture the wo vehicles as runners on an oval track . Agena has a head start , but he sticks to the outside lane and takes longer to ; o around than Gemini , who - wings from outside to inside and travels a lesser distance . So Gemini gradually catches up ; his orbital period , or time for one revolution , is less . The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their rocket throttles untouched and gain as much as five degrees on each orbit . Also , do n't forget that the two orbits touch at their high point . On one of its outward swings Gemini will come close enough to its quarry to close in . Actually it is n't quite that simple . Ground stations or the astronauts themselves can command Agena to change its orbit and speed , and Gemini too can make such changes . So various rendezvous techniques are possible , including some 365  | that lengthen the launch window from minutes to hours . But let 's not venture too far into the maze of orbital mechanics . Essentially the mission begins as I have described it . There is one other vital factor involved : plane error , or the difference in the planes of the two orbits . This error must be corrected . But diagrams tell that story best , and I refer you to the excellent illustrations on pages 366-7 . There you can see the problem and its solution . Now let 's assume that the hunter is nearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the information needed for precise maneuvering has been passed to Gemini . When the craft are about 250 miles apart , Gemini 's radar picks up Agena . Computers tell the astronauts how far they are from the target and what course corrections to make . They fire rockets , moving up , down , or laterally , at times increasing or decreasing their speed . If a large correction is required , they may flash a signal to Agena , and it will maneuver obediently . Part of the chase may occur on the night side of earth . Then stroboscopic beacons flash on Agena ; the astronauts see them as intermittent lights moving among the stars . They take sightings on the beacons and keep changing the direction of their flight until the winking lights seem to be stationary in relation to the stars . That means they have drawn a direct bead on the target , now dead ahead . Spacecraft Join While Traveling 17,500 Miles an Hour So Gemini closes in . Crewmen see their quarry clearly when two to 20 miles away , depending upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floodlights illuminate Agena 's docking collar . Flick-firing his maneuvering engines , powered by propellants similar to those used in Titan II , the Gemini commander eases his craft 's nose into the collar . Latches trip and hold the vehicles firmly together , a bond that will not be broken until the astronauts trigger a release mechanism . Now , if the men wish , they can rotate the Agena-Gemini combination and fire Agena 's engines to venture farther out into space . Joining two vehicles together while both travel 17,500 miles an hour may seem difficult in the extreme , but it is only the relative speed between the two that is of concern . Have you ever seen two speeding automobiles play a game of " bumper tag ? " One inches up on the rear of the other and playfully nudges it . This is a popular game among some teen-age drivers , and I deplore it , but it is not difficult . Similarly , when Gemini scores its tag , it will be moving only 11/2 feet per second faster than Agena , a difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the docking maneuver does not seem to be a problem , even though in space there is no air to scatter , diffuse , and soften light . All four Mercury astronauts placed in orbit saw the Atlas clearly after it separated from the capsule . Observing the booster for some time as it drifted away , they felt their judgment of its distance from them was  | not impaired by the starkness of the sunlight . Gordon Cooper conducted an experiment directly related to Gemini when , on his third rbit , he deployed from his capsule 's heat shield a 53/a-inch , 10-pound sphere contain in ; two xenon stroboscopic lights . They flashed on for approximately one ten-thousandth of each second and were about the same magnitude , when viewed from seven to nine miles away , as the star Polaris . The beacon traveled in front of Cooper 's flight path . His job : to evaluate it as an aid to rendezvous in future space flights . Astronaut Reports on Flashing Beacon Cooper did not see the light during his third orbit , but he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how the beacon appeared to a man in space : " On the nightside on the fourth orbit , I once again turned to the 180 ? heading in yaw so that I was looking forward along the orbital path . This time , as the sun was setting behind me , I saw a small light coming up toward me from below , very , very , slowly . As I watched it , it moved higher in my line of sight to the earth . Rather than flashing , however , it was a solid light . " My first thought was that it looked just like some of the missiles I had seen launched at night from our Florida space center when I had been flying at high altitudes .... I must have seen the settingsun shining off the sphere , and this must have been brighter than the flashing of the xenon light . It continued to move higher , and when it reached a point about 15 ? or so above my line of sight , it suddenly began to flash . Perhaps by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was easily visible and appeared to be approximately 10 miles away actually it was 3 to 4 miles distant and about the brightness of a second-magnitude star . I @# deliberately maneuvered the spacecraft away from the target so that I could no longer see it and then eased back into the 180 ? yaw position and easily picked up the flashing light once more . It appeared to be around 12 to 14 miles away actually it was about 8 and still quite easily visible . " On the third nightside pass after deploying the light , I had not anticipated seeing it at all , but there it was , blinking away ! At this time it was very faint and appeared at a distance of about 16 to 17 miles actually about 9 . I would say that it was approximately the brightness of a fifth-magnitude star . " Bracketed material has been inserted in Cooper 's statement to contrast true distances with his estimates . Apparently even a highly trained observer has difficulty judging how far off a beacon is in space . This human fallibility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will accurately determine the astronaut 's distance to target . The important thing is that Cooper could find a small flashing light in the immensity of space and observe its movements . " We should be able to detect it fairly easily at distances where it will appear as bright as a second- or third-magnitude star , " Cooper says . " However , it will be important to know the approximate area in which to search for it . " Cooper adds that he would prefer the beacon to be twice as bright and flash every two seconds , not every second . He also recommends two beacons on the Agena target . Long Weightlessness Worries Doctors Agena has the power to push Gemini to an apogee of 2,000 miles , far above any manned flight to date . With an improved Agena the distance would be much greater . However , you pay a price for such forays in increased speed and heat rate upon re-entry into the atmosphere . To withstand the fiery passage , the capsule would have to be toughened and its heat shield thickened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must practice to perfect rendezvous , and we must find out how well astronauts can tolerate stays of many days , not hours , ? in space . For example , we do not know the effects of prolonged weightlessness . Mere bed rest over long periods leads to cardiovascular disturbances , evidenced by the weakness and dizziness a convalescent feels when he gets to his feet . Many medical men believe zero  | gravity may have the same effect . You may recall that Gordon Cooper felt momentarily dizzy when he emerged from his capsule after a helicopter had hoisted it from the sea to the deck of a carrier . Also , astronauts have experienced . a mild but mystifying postflight reduction in blood pressure and pulse pressure . Some experts feel that weightlessness , like bed rest , may lead to a loss of calcium from the body . This occurs in bedfast patients when the skeletal structure softens because of prolonged inactivity . As yet it has not been detected in our astronauts . Probably it will be necessary to set up exercise programs for flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while weightless , nor would there be much room in Gemini for moving around . But they can easily exercise what medical men call the antagonistic muscle groups , such as the extensors and flexors . For example , an astronaut may tightly interlock his fingers while trying to pull them apart . Or he may grasp the arms of his seat and hold himself firmly down while at the same time trying to push himself up with his legs . He may even be trained to tense his muscles at will and then relax them , as a yogi would . @#  | Perhaps we may find that special exercise quipment , such as tension devices that can . e pulled or pushed , will be needed . Certainly the men must be kept in good Shape for the rigorous deceleration forces : hat mount quickly when their capsule smashes into the atmosphere during re-entry . Moments later they must be fit enough to steer their craft toward an airplanelike landing at . t predetermined spot . They will do this by deploying a paraglider , 37 feet broad from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can readily maneuver ( page 370 ) . However , Gemini will land by parachute , As did Mercury , during its first manned flights . The paraglider is under intensive develop-lent , but time will be needed to perfect it . Mercury 's builder , McDonnell Aircraft Corporation , also holds the prime contract for Gemini . It fabricates the capsule 's pressure vessel , or interior wall , from heat-resistant titanium , a difficult metal to work and weld . Shingles of beryllium and the alloy Rene 41 , capable of withstanding high temperatures , cover the exterior wall . Though the capsules are far from mass-produced items , and the equipment in each varies according to its mission , McDonnell now has a production line for them . At this stage some are what we call " boiler-plate versions , " intended only for ground tests ; others will be flight-tested without passengers . Yet now on the line is a capsule that will be " man rated , " meaning it will carry the first two Gemini astronauts into space . If all goes well , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have never been associated with a project in which the men became so engrossed , " a production line supervisor told one of my colleagues . " A seven-day work week for them , and not a single gripe ! They 're building with the heart , not just head and hands . " Mercury and Gemini share a significant limitation : They were built to operate in earth orbit . Putting men on the moon is not only more complex ; it requires a brute force in rocketry far exceeding any booster flown to date by the United States or Soviet Union . We estimate the thrust of rockets used in 373  | Soviet cosmonaut flights at about 800,000 pounds , more than twice that of an Atlas . With this power the Soviets could put up a manned space station . They might even send one man around the moon and back , though it would be a marginal venture . But they can not land men on the moon and bring them home without building a much larger booster . We believe the United States and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monstrous Boosters Will Hurl Apollo Aloft @# So the lunar trip involves a weight-lifting contest , and there are three basic ways to approach the problem . One we call EOR , for earth orbital rendezvous . Using two big first-stage boosters , you put up a tanker rocket and later your spacecraft , join them , then fly to the lunar surface . In the second , or direct method , you build rockets so monstrously huge that you can blast off to the moon without rendezvous . The third technique , LOR , for lunar orbital rendezvous , represents a choice between extremes . With multistage boosters you fly close to the moon , descend to the surface in a special vehicle , and rendezvous later with a mother ship in lunar orbit . We chose the third method for many complex technical reasons . In essence , however , it seemed safer , less complicated , and represented an important saving in payload weight . A comparison of Gemini with Apollo illustrates the power required . With the Gemini system we will be putting several tons into earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must send 45 tons into lunar orbit , which means all that massive tonnage must be accelerated to about 24,200 miles an hour , the speed necessary to escape earth and enter the gravitational field of the moon . @#  | In Mercury and Gemini , NASA has depended upon boosters built for the Air Force . Without these rockets , as well as Air Force contractors and personnel , many of the space agency 's achievements in unmanned as well as manned flight would have been impossible . But NASA 's future programs , particularly Apollo , demand boosters with a thrust beyond present Air Force needs , and the space agency is developing these superrockets . We have had a number of successful unmanned test flights with the Saturn I , whose first stage is capable of 1 1/2 million pounds of thrust , more than quadruple the power of the Atlas . With a larger upper stage , this rocket will become the even more powerful Saturn I-B and will be used to send three-man Apollo crews into earth orbit for practice flights . But even these behemoths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epochal voyage will require the Saturn V , a three-stage rocket towering 362 feet , nearly two-thirds the height of the Washington Monument in our Nation 's Capital . Assembled and fueled on its launch pad , it will weigh 3,000 tons , about the weight of the nuclear submarine Nautilus . We have n't built this giant yet , although all components are under development by industrial contractors . To test its massive stages and engines , NASA is building a huge facility in southwestern Mississippi , only 35 miles from the manufacturing complex at Michoud , Louisiana , where the Saturn V will be assembled . Barges will carry the moon rocket to its final checkout and launching site , a new area adjacent to the famed pads of the Florida space center ( pages 392-4 ) . Contractors have logged hundreds of successful test firings of Saturn V 's ultrapower-@#  | ful F-1 and J-2 engines ( page 374 ) . Five of the F-1 's , clustered in the first stage , will yield 71/2 million pounds of thrust . In terms of electric power at stage-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times the generating capacity of the Potomac Electric Power Company , serving all of Washington , D. C. , and its Maryland suburbs . The F-1 burns liquid oxygen and kerosene ? three tons every second . J-2 engines in the upper stages , however , devour liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen . Hydrogen is lighter , than kerosene and gives a higher specific impulse , a measure of thrust effectiveness , but it has the disadvantage of requiring a greater volume of tankage space . If we used it in the first stage , we would have to build a bigger booster , and the efficiency of the hydrogen would be offset by increased drag in the lower atmosphere . Apollo 's command module , like the Gemini capsule , is in limited production , but these are very early test versions by its builder . North American Aviation , Inc . In final form the cone-shaped five-ton spacecraft will have a double hull , one layer consisting of two sheets of stainless steel with a honeycomb between them , and the second having two sheets of aluminum alloy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three crewmen will recline in a row on contour couches during the first phase of the journey . Later the middle couch will be stowed beneath the lefthand one and will be used as the bed for an off-duty astronaut ( page 391 ) . In Gemini , after working out the position of instruments and equipment , we could allow only 35 cubic feet of space per man , less than in the cockpit of a T-33 jet aircraft . By comparison , the Apollo command module will be rather roomy , with 75 cubic feet per man . Crewmen will be able to move about even though their home in space will be packed  | with intricate gear , including a computer that will give them guidance information . Most of their support equipment , however , and the rocket power to put them into lunar orbit and bring them home , will be housed in another Apollo section , the service module . As our plans for the LEM evolved , the vehicle looked increasingly like some nightmarish insect , so we nicknamed it " the bug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face ( crew quarters ) , two eyes ( viewing ports ) , a mouth ( the hatch for egress to the moon ) , and long spindly-looking legs ( landing gear ) . This bizarre craft weighs 121/2 tons and can move in any direction , even hover like a helicopter . Since it was especially designed , ) r lunar landing and take-off , it is more versatile than the single all-purpose roundtrip vehicle we originally planned . Indeed the LEM represents a new line of thinking , so it is not as far along in development as the command module . Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation will build it . All the various Apollo sections will be tested in a circumlunar flight and return to earth , as well as in earth orbit , before an actual landing on the moon . Many problems and hazards exist for a lunar mission that are not encountered while orbiting the earth . Before I describe a voyage to the moon , as we now plan it , let 's look at some of these possible pitfalls . The Van Allen radiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Van Allen , must be traversed . It consists of charged particles expelled from the sun and trapped above  | the earth by our own planet 's magnetic field . Basically there is only one belt , but it includes two dissimilar regions . One consists of high-energy protons caught in a layer that arches some 2,000 miles above earth at the magnetic equator . The other , containing highenergy electrons , girdles the magnetic equator about 10,000 miles from earth . In schematic drawings these regions curve around the globe like horns or crescent moons . The second , in particular , is quite deep , extending outward some 20,000 miles . Manned space flights to date have been too low to get into this radiation , but Apollo crewmen will have to slash through it going out and coming back . Fortunately they will be exposed for a total of only a few hours , and the estimated 20 roentgens of radiation they will absorb will not be serious from a health standpoint . Their spacecraft , of course , gives only limited protection ; it can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Astronauts Beyond the Van Allen belt lies another radiation hazard from intermittent solar eruptions , or flares . Actually the sun is never really quiet , since it ejects about 400,000 tons of matter a second in all directions . But these sub-atomic particles , called the solar wind , are very sparse in the vastness of space and limited in velocity . They would not pierce a sheet of tissue paper . Flares , however , produce concentrated streams of far more energetic proton particles , some traveling at nearly the speed of light . Fortunately an outburst of radio noise coincides with these eruptions , and they can also be viewed by astronomers as they occur . Apollo crewmen will have at least four hours ' warning before the major part of the proton stream reaches them . They may have to shield themselves with special garments and goggles , but their equipment and double-hulled spacecraft are designed to keep the radiation dosage safe during one large flare . In the event of a second flare during the outward journey , they might have to scurry home . Actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We know the kinds of solar activity ? particularly sunspots ? that tend to forecast eruptions , and a safe period can be predicted with a reasonable degree of accuracy . Even when danger indicators are present on the sun , large flares do not occur in most cases . If one should happen , the chances are favorable that it will be minor or be directed away from the earth-moon system . NASA is pushing a determined program to improve the reliability of flare forecasts and to find ways for making long-range predictions . Such knowledge will be particularly important during periods when the 11-year sunspot cycle reaches a peak , as it will in late 1968 and early 1969 . Space contains a lot of rubbish ? the meteors we often see streaking down the night sky ? but most of this celestial debris is extremel. minute and no danger to Apollo . Pieces as large as a sand grain are believed rare . Statistics indicate only one chance in 10,000 that Apollo would encounter a meteor big enough to pierce the hull , yet we have planned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitting the spacecraft 's atmosphere to escape , the life-support system would automatically gush out enough oxygen to sustain the men for five minutes . In that period they could get back into their space suits and plug the hole . However , Apollo may have to avoid meteor streams that intersect the orbits of earth and moon . Astronomers count about 30 of these periodic streams or showers , but only four are considered of major importance : the Quadrantids in January , the Perseids in August , the Giacobinids in October , and the Leonids in November . Extremes of Heat and Cold Grip Moon Perhaps the greatest hazards will be found on the moon itself . For example , we know little about the composition of the lunar surface . Some authorities believe it may be covered by a dust layer from four inches to three feet in depth . Others think the dust in some areas may be far deeper , enough to engulf any spaceship . A third group holds to the theory that porous rock covers much of the surface . Obviously we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunar probes , such as our forthcoming Rangers and Surveyors. * Their intelligence will determine the final design of LEM 's landing gear . On the airless moon , a man 's best friend will be his pressure suit . If it fails , or if he should fall and tear it open on some jagged rock , the vacuum would claim him . We have good experience in building tough , dependable pressure suits , but the Apollo garment must be a super one , able to withstand micrometeorites , easily flexible at the body joints . @#  | and equipped with a highly efficient temperature-control system . This latter requirement may be the most difficult . Temperatures on the moon fluctuate savagely . Lunar dayligkt brings a maximum as high as 241 ? F. , 29 degrees above the boiling point of water . In the lunar night the temperature plummets to as low as minus 271 ? F. , or 92 degrees below the freezing point of ethyl alcohol . It is easier to heat a suit than cool it , and our astronauts may land in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sun but gently illuminated by earthshine. the reflected sunlight of our own planet . We will learn more about these hazards in the next few years , and they will yield to man 's ingenuity . So , one day before the end of this decade , NASA will declare a " go " condition for a huge Saturn V poised on its launch pad at Merritt Island , Florida , just north of the older launching sites . An elevator hoists three men in gleaming . silver space suits to the level of the command  | module , 33 stories high , and they climb in . The long countdown goes smoothly , and at T-minus-0 , the moment of launch , F-1 engines blast them from earth with the roar of a thousand Niagaras . At 206,000 feet the first stage drops like a discarded garment , and the second stage ignites . Moments later the escape tower , similar to the one used with Mercury , is cast off , and the moonship , now much lighter , accelerates rapidly . Soon stage three cuts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbit , then shuts itself off . The first phase of the mission , " parking " Apollo in space , is successful . Now , at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston , Texas , computers calculate trajectory and orbit and determine the precise moment when stage three must again be fired to put the explorers on an accurate course ? not to where the moon is at the moment but to where it will be 70 hours later . This complex problem must take into account the speed of the earth at 67,000 miles an hour relative to the sun , the speed of the moon at 2,300 miles an hour relative to the earth , and the average speed of the craft , about 3,300 miles an hour en route to the target . But the necessary information soon flashes up to the crew . They trigger stage three , and it pushes Apollo to escape velocity . Critical Moment : Linking With LEM Now another intricate maneuver must be executed . With the skill of long practice , the astronauts detach their command and service modules from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with the LEM . This frees the service module 's engine for use and joins the LEM 's access hatch to the crew quarters . The useless third stage is blasted loose , and the men settle down to a routine ( pages 395-7 ) . Probably they alternate four hours of work with four hours of rest and plan their schedule so that two men stay at duty stations at all times . They talk to earth and continually monitor equipment , particularly their computer . Linked to an inertial guidance system , it constantly tells them their course and speed . At intervals one man takes star sightings with a specially designed sextant and feeds this information to the computer . Six times , perhaps oftener , the astronauts reorient Apollo and fire its engines briefly to make necessary course corrections . Long practice in earth orbit has taught them how to move about while weightless , and light harness , fixed in strategic spots , gives them handholds or anchors them as needed . Cumbersome space suits are placed aside most of the time , though one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency . When hungry , the men drift over to their tiny galley and prepare a hot meal : meat and potatoes , sea food , fruit , vegetables . Each item comes dehydrated in a plastic bag ( page 383 ) . The astronaut adds hot water , kneads the bag , and squeezes the food into his mouth . ( I have tried it . Though not haute cuisine , it is surprisingly tasty . ) Apollo Tops a Crest and Falls Like an automobile coasting uphill , Apollo has been losing speed . Now , 220,000 miles from home , it reaches a point where the moon 's gravity wins the tug-of-war with earth 's . Once past that invisible crest , the spaceship speeds up and falls toward the moon . To brake the plunge , Apollo uses its engine like a retrorocket and enters a circular orbit 90 miles above the lunar surface . It is time for the climactic phase , the descent to the moon . Two crewmen wriggle feet first through a hatch into the LEM , release it from its mate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbit . Now LEM circles the moon in a race with the command module ; every two hours they pass each other as their orbits cross . If anything goes amiss at this stage , they will rendezvous and return home . But LEM checks out perfectly . As it approaches the low point of its orbit , 50,000 feet from the surface , the expedition commander again fires his descent engine and brings the bug down toward a preselected landing site near the moon 's equator . While the craft hovers , the men stare intently from their viewing ports , scanning the surface . They know their fuel supply permits them only two minutes to decide on a landing or a return to the mother ship . But the terrain looks safe , and they descend in a torrent of flame and dust ( page 397 ) . Their landing gear sinks for a heartstopping moment , then hits rock . The bug stands steady , its engine cut . When the commander , burdened with cameras , scientific equipment , and a life-support backpack for his suit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he will forget for a time his assigned tasks and stand in awed immobility . Myriad stars , nearly double the 2,500 visible from earth at any one time and place , sequin the heavens . Overhead 3 85 386 hangs a huge luminous globe predominantly blue in color but wearing a veil of brilliant white over vast areas . It is the time of " full earth " as seen from the moon , and our planet , though not quite four times the diameter of its neighbor world , glows with a much greater brilliance than that of the loveliest full moon ever observed by man . So a strong , eerie twilight bathes the ancient rocks and craters of the desolate lunar plain . For perhaps as many as four hours , the commander explores this new world . He makes photographs , takes notes , collects rock samples , and places instruments that will relay information home after he leaves . He moves easily in the gravitational field of the moon , only one-sixth that of earth . The sensation is one of buoyancy , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All too soon his allotted time ads . He returns to LEM and gives his partner a chance to explore . Later , their tasks completed , they begin a countdown for rendezvous with the command module . At just the right moment for intercept , they blast themselves back into the alien sky , leaving behind the LEM 's descent stage and landing gear ( page 398 ) . They overtake their target , dock , and crawl back into the mother ship for a jubilant reunion with their comrade . The 70-hour journey home proceeds much as did the outward trip . Again the men make course corrections , probably more frequently and even more painstakingly than before . Their lives depend on hitting a corridor in the earth 's atmosphere only 300 miles wide and 40 miles deep ( page 400 ) . If their angle of descent is too shallow , Apollo will skip out of the atmosphere and hurtle on into space . If their angle is too steep , abrupt deceleration in the thickening air will crush them like ants under a boot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nap off a tennis ball ? but not hitting the ball ? from a distance of 100 yards . But the guidance system does its job . Apollo obediently executes its last course correction , the service module is jettisoned , and the command module scores a bull's-eve on the narrow corridor . Flame envelops the blunt heat shield as its surface vaporizes at 6,000 ? F. ,  | twice the temperature of the Mercury shield ( page 401 ) . Apollo 's shape and an offset center of gravity give the spacecraft some lift in the atmosphere , and throughout this fireball descent the commander has been maneuvering by using his roll jets . His skill brings Apollo near its lading site , probably in the southestern part of the United States . Three parachutes billow from the top of the cone and lower the men to earth . Tired , shaky , but well , the astronauts step out . Within moments the entire United States and much of the world goes quite mad . A week of unbelievable tension ends in scenes of tumultuous rejoicing . Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart be worth the cost ? Are : here good reasons for going to a dead , hostile world ? To scientists trying to fathom the origin of the earth and other bodies of the solar system , the moon is vitally Important and its lack of an atmos- phere a decided asset . Here on earth our vast oceans and the wind and rain have obliterated surface features that could tell us much about the way the world was formed . But the surface of the moon preserves a record that may go back 41/2 billion years . There the primordial rocks remember their history and will reveal it upon scientific analysis . Similarly the moon 's interior holds secrets that we may one day discover by deep drilling . Robots fired to the moon will give us only limited information . We can not build into them the versatility and powers of decision of a man . We can not make them as dependable as a man . Only humans can give us answers to the most important questions . However , if finding out more about the origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we would not be attempting it . Other national purposes are involved . A Soviet sputnik , not a U. S. satellite , ushered in the Space Age on October 4 , 1957 . That first venture into space could have been ours . As a nation we had the ability to do it but not the foresight or the will . In the intervening years we have accomplished much , and most of us now realize that we can not remain a great nation if we do not pursue the conquest of space wholeheartedly , using whatever resources are required . It is not merely a matter of national prestige ; it also involves national strength and security . The assault on space will change our lives and our prospects in ways yet undreamed of , and we must acquire the knowledge , the resources , and the trained personnel to be first in man 's greatest endeavor . Today the military advantages of space supremacy may not be apparent , but they probably exist . No nation achieves such advantages by paper studies , nor can a threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To be safe , and to insure the safety of its friends , our Nation must build the launching sites , the huge rockets and engines , and vast assembly plants needed to get into space with heavy loads . It must develop new techniques . It must enlarge men 's knowledge in a score of scientific fields . All these things the Nation is now doing through NASA . True , the space agency has no military mission . Space and Antarctica are the only regions today where men do not bear arms , and we all pray they will remain that way . Nevertheless , NASA 's work is vital to the national security . Apollo represents a unifying goal , an incentive , and a goad for much of this work . Indeed a trip to the moon makes an ideal goal . It is difficult enough to require the building of a new and vital technology , but not so difficult that it can not be done . History teaches us that the creation of a new technology in one field invariably affects others . The automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines , alloy steels , synthetic rubber , new fuels , and many other products . The aircraft industry created a wide market for aluminum alloys , which now have countless industrial uses . Similarly , the exciting advance of our space industry has a tremendous implication for all of us who will never leave the earth . Such projects as Echo , Telstar , Relay , and Syncom , the communica-@# p 391 tions satellites ; Tiros , the weather " eye in the sky " ; and Transit , the earth-measuring satellite , are of obvious practical benefit . Less apparent , but of growing importance , is the space industry 's " spin-off , " the term we apply to developments that can be adapted to consumer use . For example , many heart patients live today because of tiny electrical devices , called cardiac pacers , that stimulate heart action . These devices , often implanted in the patients , were made possible by the aerospace industry 's success in miniaturizing electronic components . Pacers now in the planning stage may dispense with batteries and operate on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gemini and Apollo . Tiny cells would convert oxygen and glucose in the patient 's bloodstream to electricity . Water produced as the by-product would be insignificant in amount and no threat to the patient 's well-being . Many other examples of spin-off could be cited . They range from high-temperature ceramic cooking utensils to better and faster computers , from improved industrial planning techniques to the concentrated dried foods , requiring no refrigeration or cooking and occupying far less storage room than conventional foods , that have been developed for astronauts . Ln my opinion the most valuable bonus from our space activities has been the impetus given education . Colleges and schools throughout the land have changed outmoded curricula and taken up the space sciences as a new and inevitable challenge . The Space Age is only six years old . Who  | can say at this stage what prizes await the bold and the resolute ? But we do know that our world is undergoing an explosion in science and engineering . Ninety percent of all the scientists who ever lived are living today . The majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used ten years ago . In that kind of world we must not limit our horizons . A ceiling on our flights into space would be a ceiling on our spirit and our growth . To date the total space program , not just Project Apollo , has cost us about 20 cents a week per capita . We spend far more on cigarettes and alcohol than we do on space . We can afford the price of the moon and the price of the high adventures to follow . . As yet , NASA has no firm programs for manned space flight beyond Gemini and Apollo , but proposals are being weighed and analyzed under study contracts with industry . Space Stations May Be Next Step Perhaps we will want to explore the moon with a number of expeditions and even build lunar bases . ' Some scientists have proposed an observatory there ; others think the moon may become a supply depot and waystop for expeditions probing deeper into the solar system . However , my personal feeling is that such development will not proceed rapidly unless something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processed into water and fuel for spaceships . I think it more likely that a higher priority will be given manned laboratories in earth orbit . The Air Force already has announced the first such project . In 1967-68 it will fly a Gemini capsule with an attached cylindrical " caboose . " Such a craft would hold several men . Later NASA might design space stations for ten or more men , so large they would have to be assembled in orbit . In such laboratories crewmen would test over many months the equipment and components needed for voyages to Mars and Venus . Periodically their celestial home would be resupplied by spacecraft from earth . Project Apollo , complex as it is , will seem a modest step compared to the magnitude @# @#  | of getting to other planets . A round trip to Venus would require nearly a year and to Mars 11/z years . For such long journeys we would need nuclear-powered upper stages or electrically powered engines that would spew a plasma of atomic particles from their exhaust nozzles to give thrust . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next 25 years . Before the year 2,000 unmanned probes will have scouted all the planets of the solar system . We have embarked upon a long , long road from which there can be no turning back . The stars beckon us , and a brilliant new era in man 's progress unfolds.
