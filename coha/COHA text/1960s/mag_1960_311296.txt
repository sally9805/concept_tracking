Just as the Christian Lent produced the custom of Mardi gras , so the Moslem fast of Ramadan , ninth and holiest month of the lunar calendar , * has long led to peculiar accommodations in Islamic countries . For 29 or 30 days every year , the devout , who must abstain from food , drink , tobacco and sex from dawn to sundown , make up for it by overindulging and undersleeping during the hours of darkness . When Ramadan , on its 32-year migration through the solar calendar , happens to fall in summer , many a weary Moslem gives up , sleeps the whole fasting day through . Tempers grow short , and politics and propaganda a little sharper . <P> Little work gets done in Ramadan . <P> Tunisia 's modern-minded President Habib Bourguiba , a Moslem himself , regards Ramadan as so much cultural excess baggage . He has already officially abolished the veil in Tunisia and introduced European notions of marriage and divorce in place of Islamic laws , in which women have little or no rights . Then he set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps hold Islamic countries in " stagnation , weakness and decadence . " Last year in Ramadan he imposed midnight curfew on coffeehouses and other soots where revelers congregated until dawn . <P> Last week Bourguiba went all the way . <P> Before a political meeting in a Tunis movie house , he called Ramadan , with its positive requirements of prayers and meditation , a religiously " beautiful custom " that in practice too often is a " pretext that paralyzes our activity . " He shocked his hearers by urging them not to fast during Ramadan , which begins Feb. 29 . As a clinching argument , Bourguiba recalled that even Mohammed , when inconveniently overtaken by Ramadan on his march to Mecca , counseled his soldiers : " Break the fast , and you will be stronger to confront the enemy . " Today 's enemy for Tunisia , said Bourguiba , is the " humiliating backward condition of our country . " It remained to be seen whether progressive-minded President Bourguiba , for all his political strength , could break a custom of centuries . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mohammed .
