Baltimore 's research-minded Johns Hopkins University has a reputation that far outstrips its size ( 1,764 undergraduates , 2,038 grad students ) . Its fame lured Milton Eisenhower-former head of Kansas State and Penn State and adviser to four U.S. Presidents-to its presidency in 1956 . Last week Johns Hopkins landed a seasoned scholar-diplomat to succeed him : Lincoln Gordon , 53 , Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs . <P> Founded with a $7,000,000 gift from Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad Magnate Johns Hopkins in 1876 , the university pioneered graduate education in the U.S. Its School of Medicine blazed trails in public health , bacteriology and epidemiology , fashioned the modern clinical training of doctors . By the 1920s , however , the founding funds began to run dry , and Hopkins slipped into 30 years of unbalanced budgets and declining educational quality . <P> Summoned to check the slippage , Milton Eisenhower doubled the school 's endowment , raised $50 million for buildings and $30 million for equipment , hiked faculty salaries by 70% . He added a new department specializing in the philosophy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School of Advanced International Studies in Washington and Bologna . He pumped more money into the medical school , where the quality and quantity of student admissions were fading ; now , 1,200 applicants fight for the 75 openings in each freshman class . <P> True Community . Under Eisenhower , Johns Hopkins has again caught up with its reputation for excellence . One index is its enrollment of 850 postdoctoral students-the largest , for its size , of any U.S. university . It is also a collegiate democracy : the twelve-man Academic Council , elected by the faculty , has a free hand in setting academic policy . " There is no institution in the country where freedom is more prized , " proudly declared Eisenhower . " This is a true community of scholars . " <P> Gordon should fit easily into the Hopkins community since he insists that he is " only an amateur diplomat-my true profession is being a university professor . " He taught political science and economics at Harvard for nearly 20 years , interspersed his teaching with government service , ranging from World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Energy Commission . From 1961 until early 1966 , when he moved back to Washington , Gordon was an adept ambassador to Brazil . He will leave State in June , accompanied by President Johnson 's blessing as a man with " a rare combination of experience and scholarship , idealism and practical judgment . "
