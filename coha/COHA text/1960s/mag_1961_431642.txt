 | ONE SPRING NIGHT a century ago , a rowboat splashed toward a fortified island in Charleston Harbor , South Carolina . Three men stepped ashore . The flaring torches on the wharf illumined their gray uniforms and caught the silvery glint of the swords swinging at their sides . The men talked with Maj. Robert Anderson , commander of the fort . After three tense hours , one of then drew himself to attention and handed Major Anderson a slip of paper that read , in the formal manner of the day : " Sir . .. we have the honor to notify you that General Beauregard will open the fire of his batteries on Fort Sumter in one hour from this time. ? Then they climbed back into their boat and rowed away into the darkness . The time was 3:30 a.m . Major Anderson had just refused for the last time to surrender Fort Sumter to the Confederate forces that surrounded him . Undermanned , lacking supplies , he had an hour to prepare for battle ? one hour to prepare for a clash that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The issues of slavery and secession had corroded the framework of the Union , and now only the hot crucible of war could mend it .  | Major Anderson and the garrison of some 120 men took their stations on the ramparts of Fort Sumter . Promptly on schedule , a muzzle flashed on the shore , and the first shell arched through the starry sky . It was April 12 , 1861 ; the Civil War had begun . Hardly had the echoes of the Fort Sumter bombardment died away before both sides mustered their forces . Both the Union and the Confederacy expected an early victory . Jefferson Davis had already , on March 6 , 1861 , called for 100,000 volunteers to serve one year ; President Abraham Lincoln 's first appeal , on April 15 , for 75,000 militiamen provided for only three months ' service .

Off on this bright new lark , they followed fife and drum down the springtime streets . Girls , lining the sidewalks like crinolined flowers , waved handkerchiefs and cheered . The 7th New York reported for action in trim , tailor-made uniforms ? and , thoughtfully , they brought their own chefs . Louisiana bolstered the Confederacy with a regiment of Zouaves , clad in baggy pants and fezzes . Pennsylvania provided the Union with a cavalry unit armed with lances . Fine and brave in their new uniforms , the opposing forces first clashed head on along a creek called Bull Run , which winds through the rolling green hills of northern Virginia . Both armies used clumsy tactics , and the resulting blunders shocked the country . But maturity comes fast in war . The four sad and terrible years that followed not only faded the gay uniforms but bred a vicious skill . At Gettysburg , withering Union lire cut down 708 men of the 800-strong 26th North Carolina Regiment ; during the same battle Confederate guns inflicted a grisly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surrender at Appomattox Court House spelled an end to the Civil War , more than half a million men ? North and South ? had left their lives on that last barricade where springtimes cease and no girls wave . Sir Winston Churchill has termed this fratricidal war that rent our Nation 100 years ago " the noblest and least avoidable of all the great mass-conflicts of which till then there was record . " And the English military  | historian Gen. J. F. C. Fuller has described it as " one of the most extraordinary of wars ever fought ? an epoch-making war in military and civil history . " Indeed the United States Civil War stands as a crossroads between the limited wars of yesterday and the total wars of today . It was the last war in which generals frequently faced and met death while personally leading their troops ; it was the first war in modern times to engage entire populations rather than just professional armies . For all Americans its story must be dear , because it was essentially our war , with Americans fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can easily visit them and study them , and millions of us had ancestors on one side or the other ? or both . Because the men in each contending army believed they were fighting for a cause worthy of " the last full measure of devotion , " they bravely sustained proportional battle losses unheard of since Leonidas and his 300 Spartans died at Thermopylae.  | Unschooled in war , these same American troops forever altered the science of military strategy . Since no immutable doctrine from previous conflicts had been impressed upon either army , each was free to use the resourcefulness inherent in the American character . The respective armies solved in their own way the problems they encountered ; their innovations transformed the art of war . Rifled cannon and breech-loading repeating rifles forced the development of new tactics ; the telegraph enabled commanders , for the first time in history , to exercise simultaneous control over widely separated armies ; railroads and river steamers provided new mobility for troops , permitting the rapid transfer of large units from one theater of operations to another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely used in the Civil War , as were wire entanglements and pontoon trains for quick bridging of rivers . When the ironclads U. S. S. Monitor and C. S. S. Virginia ? actually the rebuilt Federal  | frigate Merrimack ? locked in battle at Hampton Roads on March 9 , 1862 , they revolutionized naval warfare . Before the sun went down on that historic day , every wooden man-ofwar in every navy of the world had suddenly become obsolete . International law also felt the impact of the Civil War . The publication of General Orders , No. 100 , on April 24 , 1863 , stands as the first codification of the laws and usages of civilized warfare regarding treatment of prisoners as well as the population of occupied territory . Francis Lieber , a professor of international law at Columbia College , New York , had drawn up the code at the direction of Gen. Henry W. Halleck . The Prussian Government soon adopted General Orders , No. 100 , for the guidance of its armies in the Franco-Prussian War . Later , the code served as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1907 . As a Nation , we should never forget that the Civil War was a great human drama . Although the contestants are generally referred to as " the North " and " the South , " it is a mistake to believe that the population of either geographical region shared a complete unanimity of opinion . Many in the North sympathized openly with the South and vociferously denounced the war as it dragged on . On the other hand , many Southerners opposed secession . Most , however , served their States when it became evident that Federal troops would be used to force them back into the Union . This lack of unity on either side sometimes resulted in agonizing personal decisions . Capt . John C. Pemberton headed south from Pennsylvania to serve as a lieutenant general in the Confederate Army ; Col. Samuel Cooper of New Jersey became the Confederate Adjutant General . At the same time , George H. Thomas of Virginia elected to follow the old flag and became a Union major general ; David G. Farragut of Tennessee , as an admiral in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico ports . Two Brothers Become Opposing Generals The division of families stands out as one of the stark tragedies of the war . For example , one son of Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky served as a general in the Confederate forces while the other became a general in the Union Army . Cruelty is the handmaid of war , and outrages mar the records of both Northern and Southern soldiers , but the Civil War was also  | replete with instances of mutual consideration , knightly courtesy , and nobility . At Fredericksburg , Confederate Sgt. Richard Kirkland heard wounded Union soldiers calling for water . He vaulted across a stone wall with as many canteens as he could gather and relieved their suffering at the risk of his own life . In an unpublished manuscript a Union soldier describes the surrender of Vicksburg . He tells how the men of the two armies fraternized immediately after the surrender , and adds , " But along with that there was a preliminary arranged which proved satisfactory to all parties , and that was that the poor starved fellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our boys could furnish them . " This they evidently provided from their own depleted haversacks . Mercy Lightens Dark Years At Kenesaw Mountain in Georgia on June 27 , 1864 , underbrush sheltering Union wounded broke into flame . Confederate Col. W. H. Martin saw the threat to his wounded enemies , jumped on the parapet waving his white handkerchief , and shouted to the Federal troops : " We wo n't fire a gun until you get them away . " After the surrender of Fort Donelson , Tennessee , when Confederate Gen. Simon Bolivar Buckner was informed that boats stood ready to transport his captured brigade north , he invited my grandfather , Gen. Ulysses S. Grant , to see them off . Buckner 's troops had fought well , and he was proud of them even in defeat . When Grant reached the boats , the prisoners crowded around their captor with respectful curiosity . General Buckner addressed them , pointing out that General Grant had behaved with kindness and magnanimity . He bade his men remember this , and then added that , should the fortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of his soldiers the same treatment they were now receiving . Many instances of General Grant 's consideration for the people in territory occupied by his troops have been brought to my attention ? sometimes by descendants of those he benefited . His General Orders , No. 50 , of August 1 , 1863 , issued in Mississippi , is an example of his desire to mitigate the horrors of war : " Within the County of Warren , laid waste by the long presence of contending armies , " he appointed two commissaries to " issue articles of prime necessity to all destitute families calling for them .... " Sternly he added : " Conduct disgraceful to the American name has been frequently reported to the Major General Commanding .... Summary punishment will be inflicted upon all officers and soldiers apprehended in acts of violence or lawlessness . " Col. Charles Marshall , who accompanied Gen. Robert E. Lee at his surrender , publicly 445  | praised General Grant for the terms granted at Appomattox . Lt. John S. Wise , C. S. A. , remarked of his comrades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived and died so gloriously unless under the deep conviction that they were right ? Grant appreciated this as few others did , and testified to it in every manly way . It is that which makes every true Confederate soldier venerate Grant 's memory and hold his fame next to that of his own Commander .... Almost before they had completed their surrender to him , he seemed more anxious to feed his prisoners from the rations of his own men than he was to secure his captives . " Yet a deep gulf divided civilian and military views of the surrender terms . Nicolay and Hay , in their great biography of President Lincoln , wrote of Grant : " He ended with a phrase which he had evidently not thought of , and for which he had no authority , which practically pardoned and amnestied every man in Lee 's army ? a thing he had refused to consider the day before , and which had been expressly forbidden him in President Lincoln 's order of the 3d of March . " That forbidden phrase provided that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their homes , not to be disturbed by United States authority so long as they observe their paroles and the laws in force where they may reside . " Some years later that same generous clause enabled General Grant to prevent indictment by the civil courts of General Lee and other military leaders of the defeated South . It is , therefore , no exaggeration to acclaim the Civil War as the last gentlemen 's war . The Civil War Centennial Commission does not look upon the war 's hundredth anniversary as an occasion for celebration , reviving here the exultation of victory and there the sadness of defeat ; rather , this anniversary must give us a new understanding of the way in which Americans built from suffering and sacrifice an enduring Nation . Our forefathers fought to the limit of endurance for four years ; when the echo of the  | last shot died away , they saw in the unity of their land something that overshadowed the bitterness of the struggle . Since then , the sons and grandsons of Federals and Confederates alike have fought shoulder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict , Americans have given the world an example not only of how to fight a war , but of how to end a war . History offers few lessons more inspiring . So the centennial must be a new study of American patriotism ? a study which should give us a deeper appreciation of the bravery , sacrifice , and idealism in the American character . The study must be based on a broad 447  | knowledge of the underlying facts . From the ingenuity with which an unprepared people met the challenge of the first modern war , we can learn much . It goes without saying that , where fables and legends have obscured real facts , the truth must be made clear . We are not preparing to commemorate a romantic myth ; we are preparing for a searching look at a chapter of our own history , a chapter that recounts our greatest national tragedy . But from this tragedy has emerged a more firmly united country ? a country that has become the leader of the Free World . By producing an extraordinarily informative map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil War , together with a comprehensive series of articles to appear in the next four years , the National Geographic Society is making a notable contribution to the Civil War Centennial . In the map notes and in the articles , readers will discover persons and events barely alluded to in general histories of the Civil War . They will learn that this war was not a game of military chess played with human pawns , but an experience that evoked the bravest and the finest in the American character . From this added knowledge , from the entire centennial observance , we should and will gain enhanced pride in being Americans .
