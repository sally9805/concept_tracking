txt The Roy M. Cohn trial jury failed again last night to reach a verdict and will begin its fourth day of deliberations at 1 P.M. today . Curiously silent , the jurors gave Federal Judge Archie 0 . Dawson no indication of the nature of the deadlock that has kept them in fruitless discussion since Thursday morning . Without an admission that they were unable to return a verdict , Judge Dawson had no recourse but to lock them up for the third night . He sent them again to a midtown hotel at 10:30 o'clock , and told them they had better eat lunch as well as breakfast before returning to the Federal Courthouse . The courthouse is at Foley Square , an area where most restaurants are shut on Sunday .. Cohn Voices Optimism He also instructed United States marshals to make arrangements for those jurors who wanted to attend church . Mr. Cohn , dead tired from the marathon courtroom vigil , predicted a climax today . " I think it 'll be a hung jury , " he said , " but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jury would hang had shifted with his changing moods ? on Thursday it was 11 to 1 for acquittal , on Friday 8 to 4 . Last night he was too exhausted to make an estimate . Judge Dawson and the defendants spent much of the afternoon on the courthouse steps , entertained at intervals by a fife and drum band of Chinese children parading in the square . Accused of Perjury Mr. Cohn , one-time aide to the late Senator Joseph R. McCarthy , and his co-defendant , Murray E. Gottesman , both lawyers , were charged with lying in 1962 to a Federal grand jury . The jury was investigating how four swindlers escaped indictment three years earlier in an investigation of the $5 million United Dye and Chemical Corporation securities swindle . Federal Court juries that deliberate as long as the Cohn jury usually give the judge some clue as to how badly the ; jurors are split . But by late afternoon the jury had made only its second request for a reading of testimony . The jury asked for a reading of the cross-examination and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cohn and Mr. Gottesman and two of the swindlers , Samuel S. Garfield and Allen K. Swann , in Garfield 's Pierre Hotel suite in August , 1959 . The Government had contended that the purported meeting was a fabrication of Mr. Cohn and Mr. Gottesman to cover up alleged attempts to fix the 1959 indictment . The jury listened for two hours while a court attendant read testimony of Mr. Cohn , Mr. Gottesman , Swann and Hyman Lehrich , a former counsel for United Dye . ' Enough for Now ' It also asked for the testimony of three other witnesses , but the foreman , Harold T. Bertha , after a conference with other jurorsP broke in to say : " I think that 's enough for now . If we need more we will ask for it . " Whether Mr. Cohn and Mr. . Gottesman actually met the swindlers in the Hotel Pierre was vital to the two perjury counts against Mr. Gottesman and to one of the three perjury counts against Mr. Cohn . Mr. Cohn testified that he had recommended Mr. Gottesman to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hotel suite to introduce him to Garfield and to Swami , who was to appear before a grand jury next day . But both Garfield and Swann said they had never seen Mr. Gottesman until they confronted him in court three weeks ago . Mr. Lehrich , who was in and out of the Garfield suite during the day of the alleged meeting , also testified that he had not seen either Mr. Cohn or Mr. Gottesman . The defense was heartened last night when the jury , returning from dinner , asked Judge A. Dawson to repeat part of the supplemental charge he delivered Thursday morning . In this portion , Judge Dawson told the jury that if it could not believe testimony of two self-confessed swindlers ? key witnesses of the Government ? concerning an alleged bribe to Mr. Cohn , then it could doubt the credibility of all their testimony against Mr. Cohn . Bribery Not Charged Bribery was not charged in the nine-count indictment against Mr. Cohn and Mr. Gottesman . But the case was overshadowed by the testimony of the two swindlers , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Robson , former chief United States attorney . Before receiving the jury 's afternoon request , Judge Dawson , basking near the front entrance , indicated surprise that the jurors had not called upon him more often . " I 'm here if they need me ; all they have to do is ask , " said the judge after the jury had gone through most of the morning without asking for anything but coffee . " Well , there 's nothing I can do inside , " the judge added . " So I might as well be out here taking in this beautiful day . " Mr. Cohn , surrounded by friends , stayed off the front stoop while Judge Dawson was there . He explained : " I do n't want to embarrass the judge by going out there . " Later , after the judge had retired to his chambers , Mr. Cohn crossed the street , removed his coat , and sunbathed on a park bench . The jury of 10 men and two women received the case at 11:37 A.M. Thursday after 16 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated case by ordering the Government to hand over to the defense on the evening preceding their testimony the secret statements that prosecution witnesses had made to the Government . Judge Dawson believed that this policy would eliminate adjournments , since the defense could not claim surprise . " I think it probably saved a week in this case , " he said yesterday . Denies Taking Bribe The judge 's ruling enabled the defense to learn that two of the ' swindlers had testified to a 1962 grand jury about the splitting of an alleged bribe between Mr. ; Cohn and Morton S. Robson , ' former chief assistant United States attorney . The purported payoff waf : made in 1959 after the swindler escaped indictment . They were subsequently indicted and pleaded guilty . Mr. Robson , as a defense wit- ; ness , vehemently denied having , Itaken a bribe and said he had never been in Las Vegas , the scene of the purported bribetaking . He was supported by witnesses who said they saw ' him ; in New York the day the prosecution witness put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States Attorney for the 1Southern District of New York in 1959 , testified that he alone had made the decision to omit the swindlers from the 1959 indictment ; he said Mr. Robson had never tried to Influence the decision . The original indictment contained seven counts of perjury and obstruction of justice against Mr. Cohn , two counts of perjury against Mr. Gottesman and a count of conspiracy against both . The conspiracy charge was dismissed . If convicted on all remaining counts , Mr. Cohn would face a maximum of 35 years in prison : and $26,000 fine and Mr Gottesman a maximum of 10 years and $4,000.
