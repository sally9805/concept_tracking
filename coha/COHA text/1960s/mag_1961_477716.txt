His dissenting opinions are prodding American lawyers ( and some of his colleagues ) into sharp debate ? and giving more than philosophic significance to the question of " absolutes . " EARLY last year , Mr. Justice Hugo Black came to New York University and delivered an address which quickly aroused intense interest among lawyers and friends of civil liberty . It was , perhaps , the most forceful recent statement of one side of a controversy over the Bill of Rights which ? repeatedly and over many years ? has divided the judiciary , split the Supreme Court , and posed troubling issues for those concerned with the preservation of individual freedom in America . In very rough and general terms , the question at issue is : How wide are the protections afforded by the Bill of Rights ? When one of its protected freedoms seems to conflict with the social order or security , should the values of the Bill of Rights be followed out to the limit ? Or should adherence to these values be qualified by a rule of convenience ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Supreme Court at the top ? defer to the solution reached by some other authority , e.g. , the Congress , the state legislatures , or local law-enforcement agencies ? Or should the judiciary take a firm and independent line in protecting individuals , without regard to the views taken by transient legislative majorities or local police chiefs ? During his long career on the bench , Mr. Justice Black has emerged as a leader of the side that calls for wide interpretation and strict enforcement of the guarantees in the Bill of Rights . Thus , it is not surprising that his New York University address on the Bill of Rights caused a stir within the professional legal community . But the significance of this speech extends far beyond the concern of lawyers and judges ; it touches the national interest . " It is my belief , " the Justice said , " that there are ' absolutes ' in our Bill of Rights , and that they were put there on purpose by men who knew what words meant , and meant their prohibitions to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions which stem from it ? have often set Justice Black apart from some of his colleagues . He is very conscious of his apartness and in his speech summed up the views of the other side as follows : Some people regard the prohibitions of the Constitution , even its most unequivocal commands , as mere admonitions which Congress need not always observe . This viewpoint finds many different verbal expressions . For example , it is sometimes said that Congress may abridge a constitutional right if there is a clear and present danger that the free exercise of the right will bring about a substantive evil that Congress has authority to prevent . Or it is said that a right may be abridged where its exercise would cause so much injury to the public that this injury would outweigh the injury to the individual who is deprived of the right . Again , it is sometimes said that the Bill of Rights guarantees must " compete " for survival against general powers expressly granted to Congress , and that the individual 's right must , if outweighed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in denying the right . All of these formulations , and more with which you are doubtless familiar , rest , at least in part , on the prefflise that there are no " absolute " prohibitions in the Constitution , and that all 64 MR . JUSTICE BLACK constitutional problems are questions of reasonableness , proximity , and degree . This view comes close to the English doctrine of legislative omnipotence , qualified only by the possibility of a judicial veto if the Supreme Court finds that a Congressional choice between " competing " policies has no reasonable basis . If this split in Supreme Court opinion is as sharp as it seems to be in Justice Black 's analysis . it deserves much wider public attention than it has had . Does it mean that we are living through a period of erosion of our constitutional guarantees ? Does justice Black 's position represent a lost cause ? Or is it a stand which the American people would favor if they realized the gravity of the issue ? THE COERCED SALUTE S 0 M E recent decisions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " status to the Bill of Rights guarantees . The Feiner case , decided in 1951 , is a good example . Feiner , a young student , got up on a wooden box in Syracuse and , in a " loud , high-pitched voice , " made a rather unpleasant speech , in which he called President Truman a " bum . " The police concluded , or claimed to have concluded , that there was danger of trouble if Feiner continued , and they ordered him to stop , instead of taking action to control the crowd . Feiner refused : he was arrested and sentenced to thirty days . On appeal from his conviction , he invoked the protection of the free-speech Amendment , Article I of the Bill of Rights . Was Feiner 's right to speak his mind an " absolute , " or could it properly he made to yield to the demands of public order that moved the police ? A divided Supreme Court upheld Feiner 's conviction . Concurring , Justice Felix Frankfurter said : Adjustment of the inevitable conflict between free speech and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perplexing . It is important to bear in mind that this Court can only hope to set limits and point the way . It falls to the lot of legislative bodies and administrative officials to find practical solutions within the frame of our decisions . .. . . . . While the Court has emphasized the importance of " free speech , " it has recognized that " free speech ' ' is not in itself a touchstone . The Constitution is not unmindful of other important interests , such as public order , if interference with free expression of ideas isnot Found to he the overbalancing consideration . . . Mr. Justice Black dissented in the Feiner case . His New York University speech must be considered as a continuation of that dissent as well as of others in which he has challenged judgments of the Court which qualify , in the name of comfort or safety or peace , the rights that seem to be granted by the Constitution and its Amendments . The issue he broaches is evidently one of urgency , as the Feiner case illustrates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a crowd does n't like his speech , and because the police have elected to shut him up rather than to enforce order in the crowd , then we are to a dangerous extent talking mere cant when we talk about freedom of speech in the United States . Nor is the Feiner case an isolated phenomenon . Even the sketchiest review of the many relevant cases is impossible here , but mention may he made of the Supreme Court 's earlier decisions involving schoolchildren who had raised admittedly sincere religious objections to saluting the flag . Here some members of the Court found there was no conflict between the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion and the refusal of school authorities to yield to the objections of the children . These justices based their view on the ground that sentiments of patriotism might be inculcated by coercing the children to salute . Another much-cited example is the Beauharnais case . where a " group libel " statute passed by the Illinois legislature was challenged by a distributor of anti-Negro leaflets , on the grounds that it violated the guarantees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislature 's apprehensions of disorder were sufficient to sustain the statute . ( It seems hardly necessary to emphasize how irrelevant it is that the people seeking Bill of Rights protection in cases of this sort often hold views with which a great many of us would disagree more or less violently : only those who espouse unpopular doctrines , or doctrines thought obnoxious or dangerous , are likely to be bothered by legislatures and police , and so to find themselves in need of constitutional protection . ) Charles 1 , . Black . Jr . was born in Texas and is now Henry R. Lace Professor of Jurisprudence at Yale University . His recent book , " The People and the Court . " is an analysis of the functions of the Supreme Court . He is not related to Alabamaborn Justice Hugo L. Black , the subject of this article , who was named to the Court in 1937 . What light does justice Black 's thesis that the guarantees of the Bill of Rights are " absolute " throw on such cases ? A number of questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here on two . First , Mr. Justice Black himself recognizes , as of course he must , that even " absolute " rights have the limits that inhere in their own definitions ; the most absolutist view of free speech must begin by defining what " free speech " consists in . No one would argue , for example , that the " free speech " protected by the First Amendment includes mere personal slander , or fraudulent oral misrepresentation of goods offered for sale , or perjury on the witness stand , or intentionally giving the wrong directions to a fire truck . In a close case , the process of defining " free speech " involves the weighing of competing public and private interests , for a reasonable construction of any legal language , including the language of the Bill of Rights , is a construction that leads to a result that is , at least , not absurd . May one not infer that enforcement of the Bill of Rights guarantees is necessarily a process not of giving effect to " absolutes " but of balancing asserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivate the curtailment of freedom ? Secondly , even if the definition problem is somehow gotten around , is Mr. Justice Black not asking for the impossible when he claims " absolute " status for the Bill of Rights guarantees ? Can any claim be so sacrosanct that it will never yield to competing claims of public order or private equity ? These questions touch real difficulties . But there is a good deal more to be said before we decide that Mr. Justice Black went wholly wrong , or even that there is not significant wisdom in his contentions. penalization of such a speech as Feiner 's , delivered under such conditions , came , as a matter of constitutional construction , within the meaning of the First Amendment phrase . " abridging the freedom of speech . " Two things would clearly be true . First , the principle that free speech is an " absolute " could easily be left quite intact , and Feiner jailed none the less , if the judicial holding were to be that Feiner 's actions did not come within the meaning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police and of the state ? did not come within the meaning of the word " abridge . " ( It could be contended , just to take the last point , that free speech is not " abridged " when speech is suppressed for some reason having to do with public order . ) Secondly , no sensible solution to this problem of definition could be reached without placing in some kind of confrontation the interest in free expression and the interest in public order . This example may seem to clinch the case of those who contend that the " balancing " of competing interests , rather than " absolute " right , is what is involved in Bill of Rights cases , for it shows that " balancing " would in some sense be involved even if one tried to take the " absolutist " view . But does n't it prove ( or at least suggest ) too much , from the point of view of those who object to Mr. Justice Black 's thesis ? For if the Feiner case could be decided against Feiner even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to wonder whether it really makes any difference whether we talk about " absolutes " or " balancing " ? And the curious fact is that , in the purely logical sense , it does n't . The issue between Mr. Justice Black and his adversaries is a peculiar one . He may , as a matter of logic alone , be making a rather vacuous assertion ( if you read him with great literalness ) when he insists that the Bill of Rights guarantees are " absolutes , " since every bit of " balancing " that could possibly enter into the qualification of these rights can enter just as well into their definition as into a process of denying them " absolute " force after they are defined . But those who insist that these guarantees are not " absolutes " are themselves in just the same position , and for just the same reason . All of their " balancing " might just as well be relegated to the stage at which rights are defined ; the right as defined could then be enforced as an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of substance is really at issue in this controversy over whether the guarantees in the Bill of Rights are or are not to be called " absolutes . " As Horace Walpole said of the dismissal 66 MR . JUSTICE BLACK of a Methodist lady-in-waiting for her refusal to play cards at court on Sunday , it is absurd to refuse it , and absurd to insist upon it . Or is it ? Both sides are fighting hard about this question . Maybe it is overhasty to conclude that nothing is at stake . Let 's take it down to common life . There are two fathers . One says , " My children have an absolute right to my presence and help . " The other says , " Few personal problems call for so much delicate balancing as the process of deciding , from day to day , just how much my children are to have of my presence and help , as against other claims on my time and energy . " The first man , if pressed , would have to admit that he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in every imaginable way , and even that it might not be a good thing if he could . He would admit , moreover ? as a logical consequence of this practical admission ? that he must first define his rather vague terms , before he can make out the contours of his obligation to his children , and that this definitional process can involve some pretty delicate balancing . The second man , these admissions made , would of course have to say , " All right , you may call your obligation ' absolute ' if you like , since in defining it you go through the same sort of balancing process as I do when I weigh my obligations to my children against competing claims . " Nothing is left at issue . But which one would you bet on for being at home the most evenings . when the hour rolls around for the bedtime ritual ? WHAT IS REALLY AT STAKE ? W HERE battle is joined about a form of expression , and where logical analysis seems to show that the same result can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not . it is a safe conjecture that what is really on the scale is attitude . Attitude is what is at stake between Mr. justice Black and his adversaries . On the whole it seems clear ? though it must be said that it is not necessarily true in every case , and is demonstrably untrue in some cases ? that the man who prefers to look on the Bill of Rights guarantees , once they are defined , as " absolutes " will see them as more broadly defined and enforce them with more resolution than will the man who prefers to stress their character as invitations to start " balancing . " It is not hard to see why this difference in attitude has been symbolized in this seemingly verbal debate . " Balancing " ? for the purpose of arriving at the definition of a right thenceforward to be enforced " absolutely " ? has a tendency to stop somewhere ; mere " balancing " as such has no tendency to stop anywhere . This is put forward as a psychological and not as a logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its plausibility . But it becomes more plausible when you reflect that , as the " definition " of a right is made to depend more and more on reference to countervailing considerations , it takes on a strained and unnatural flavor , outraging the common usages of language . If a man hires a hall , decently advertises his speech on birth control , and begins to deliver it in moderate tones and without obscenity or epithet , it is psychologically difficult , though not logically impossible . to say that what he is doing is not the exercise of " free speech " just because some people in town are upset about it , and may even heckle . It is much easier , if you want to stop him , to say that his " interest " in free speech must be " balanced " against the " interest " of the community in peace and order . As a matter of attitude , the language of " balancing " is apt language , easily conformable language , for the job of cutting down to what somebody thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom which the Bill of Rights set out to protect . WHERE CONGRESS COMES IN T HERE is at stake here ton a matter of attitude regarding the proper respective functions of the judicial and legislative branches of our government . The business of construing the language used in the Constitution is an anciently established judicial function , of a piece with the general judicial function of construing other legal language . Such balancing as enters naturally into this process is therefore with entire propriety to be committed to the courts . The general balancing of policy factors is on the other hand a traditional legislative responsibility . To insist that such " balancing " be done at the stage of definition ? and this , as we have seen , is the upshot of the " absolutist " position ? is thus tantamount to insisting that the Court accept responsibility as interpreter and protector of the constitutional rights of its suitors , and that it take a firm stand in enforcing those rights . To insist upon generalizing the " balancing " process , and extending it beyond the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abdicate its protective role , under the guise of deference to the legislative branch . Judicial balancing , for purposes of defining a constitutional right , may differ in kind from the sort of general " balancing " traditionally referred to the legislative branch . The judicial tradition , for example , would direct itself , much more naturally than would the legislative , to historical materials ? not merely to discover the precise 7. ocus of the productive language of the Bill of Rights , but to ascertain its thrust , its deep and enduring implications . The judicial tradition , moreover , has few mechanisms , and these uneasily used , for surrendering authoritatively stated principles to mere arguments of present convenience . The emphasis on " balancing " is in practice antithetical to the original understanding so clearly stated by Madison , as quoted by Mr. Justice Black : If they the Bill of Rights Amendments are incorporated into the Constitution , independent tribunals of justice will consider themselves in a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights ; they will be an impenetrable bulwark against any assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be naturally led to resist every encroachment upon rights expressly stipulated for in the Constitution by the declaration of rights . dom of speech or freedom of religion or jury trial , is an " absolute , " or whether it is subject to being " balanced " out of the picture . Here again we must begin by conceding that , taken literally , Mr. Justice Black is wrong . No right , however defined , ever turns out to he really " absolute , " if you think about it long enough . Take torture . General immunity from being tortured is something all of us would regard as an essential of civilized life . We might carelessly refer to it as an " absolute . " But what if an atom bomb were ticking somewhere in the city , and the roads were closed and the trains were not running , and the man who knew where the bomb was hidden sat grinning and silent in a chair at the country police station twenty miles away : Could the " absolute right " not to be tortured really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Johnson , who was addicted both to accuracy and to veracity , said in substance that if one stood before a great orchard and remarked , " There is no fruit in that orchard , " and there came " a poring man " who found two apples and three pears , the first speaker would he right in dismissing the objection with laughter . The great Cham was invoking ( though not sub eo nornine ) the mathematical concept of " orders of magnitude " ? the concept of quantities so small in relation to other quantities that changes within the smaller order of magnitude in effect make no difference in the larger order of magnitude . Torture is again a good exam* . The right not to be tortured can not , literally , be an " absolute . " But is it not equally true , and much more importantly true , that the right not to be tortured is entirely unsuitable for ' balancing " against competing considerations of convenience , comfort , and safety , as we " balance " such considerations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of prudence ? " Absolute right " is literally incorrect when it comes to torture ; there are two apples and three pears in that orchard . " Balancing " is literally correct when it comes to torture ; the two apples and three pears really are there . But which of these expressions ? the " correct " or the " incorrect " ? most faithfully approximates and renders the attitudes and probable actions of most decent people when it comes to torture ? And what suspicion would we form if a man kept insisting , in season and out , that the right not to be tortured was not an " absolute , " but only the subject matter for " balancing " ? The issue raised by Mr. Justice Black 's address is between two ways of looking on the judicial 6S MR . JUSTICE BLACK function in Bill of Rights cases . In formal logic , the " balancing " and the " absolute " positions can be rendered as identical . The issue must therefore be which of them most naturally , in common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicial process in such cases to take . Stressing of the " balancing " terminology tends both to create an endless series of successful objections , on grounds of policy , to the prevalence of the Bill of Rights freedoms , and to inhibit the Court From interfering with legislative judgments in this field . The " absolutist " view , taken sensibly , would tend to carve out large areas of personal freedom to he enjoyed without regard to transient legislative views on the pressing necessity of shutting people up , or making them worship alike , or jailing them after a short-cut trial . One can understand the appeal of the latter alternative to Mr. Justice Black and to others who are convinced that the Bill of Rights was meant to have vastly important el fects not always agreeable to the majority of the moment ; and who arc also convinced that these effects should take place ( as is lucidly clear on the face of the text ) by means of comprehensive prohibitions ? real , binding prohibitions ? on the legislative branch . WHERE DO WE WISH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Justice Black 's thesis is misleading , since some sort of " balancing " must be a part of the judicial process in Bill of Rights cases , as in all other cases . But in this context the choke of expression , as we have seen , involves more than scientific accuracy ; before we decide which view is the more " misleading " we must decide where we want to be led , and where the Bill 14 Rights seeks to lead us . If we believe that crucially important decisions were fixedly made by the adoption of the Bill of Rights , then it is highly misleading to speak of the Court 's task in this field as merely one of " balancing interests " ; for the outcome of the balancing process must be taken already to have been settled , in vast and important areas . The " balancing " approach suggests that the " interest " in free speech , for example , must " compete " in court on pretty equal terms with other " interests " ? without clear benefit of superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What , then , happened when thrrirst Amendment was adopted ? The " balancing " approach contains no satisfactory answer to this question . And that approach is also highly misleading - 5- * - -  - if our goal is a vigorous judicial guarding of the Bill of Rights , if its guarantees are to be ? as Jefferson and Madison thought they would be ? real legal rights , enforceable in court . The view of a Bill of Rights case as no more than a general invitation to " balance interests " strongly suggests that all the issues should be remitted to the legislative Forum , where mere " interests , " as opposed to legal rights , are customarily " balanced . " Mr. justice Black is an experienced judge with a long head . It would not be surprising to find him quite aware that a sort of " balancing " enters into the process of defining each of the rights he regards as " absolute , " and that even after the definition is reached it would outrage common sense to say that under no conceivable circumstances may the right be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " absolutes , " justice Black may very well be insisting on two things : ( I ) That the ordinary " balancing " which takes place in Bill of Rights cases must take place in the process of defining the rights , so that a lawyer or a judge who proposes , for example . to put a man in jail for speaking in public on politics will have to say , " What we are doing is not an abridgment of freedom of speech ; it is something else " ? and offer reasons for this conclusion that can be swallowed by people who speak standard English . ( 2 ) That the justifications which are put forward for infringing these rights , as defined , should be disregarded unless they rise not merely to a higher degree but to an altogether different order of magnitude from the sort of miscellaneous prudential considerations which are ordinarily referred to when we speak of " balancing " equities and conveniences . There are no absolutes , not even in the construction of the word " absolute " when it is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rights freedoms an absolute status in imagined chemical purity would in the end be meaningless . To claim this status for them , in the practical sense in which chemicals labeled " chemically pure " are " pure , " is not meaningless . If something like justice Black 's intent is captured here , then he has called for a feasible program of thought and action . And it is a program which would revive , before it is too late , the old American faith that our Bill of Rights embodies not ( as has actually been suggested ! ) mere admonition , but tough living law ? law that will listen to reason a long time , but that will , in the end , inexorably assert a reason of its own .
