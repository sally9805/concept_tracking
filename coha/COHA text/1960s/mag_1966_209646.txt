THE Man of the Year cover story is quite unlike any other that appears in 52 weeks of TIME . It is essentially retrospective . While 22 reporters contributed to this week 's citation of General William Westmoreland and the men he commands , the story is more than anything else an assessment of the events and policies that have revolved around the Viet Nam War in the past twelve months . This summation and judgment was the responsibility of writer and editor , who have watched the Viet Nam story with intense attention week after week . Writer Ronald Kriss has written many of our stories on Viet Nam action and policy during the year , including last winter 's cover story on General Westmoreland ( Feb. 19 ) . Senior Editor Michael Demarest has been editing THE NATION section since the buildup in Viet Nam began . <P> For the more immediate aspects of this week 's cover , TIME dispatched two men who were half a world apart-Hong Kong Bureau Chief Frank McCulloch and New York Sculptor Robert Berks-to converge in a Honolulu garden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the war with his family , sculptor and reporter were able to hold him relatively still for four sittings and simultaneous interviews . But only relatively . <P> " With his incredible ability to concentrate , " McCulloch reported , " the general would patiently break off to read and answer an urgent cable from Saigon , field a question from one of the children , or take a call from Honolulu-based CINCPAC , and then not only resume his pose but take up my question precisely where he had left it . Each of the four formal sessions ran far past the scheduled hour and a half-mostly , I think , because everyone involved enjoyed it . I frequently became so fascinated with the magic Berks worked so swiftly with his clay that I left questions hanging while watching the Westmoreland image emerge . But either Berks or the general was able to compensate for that , usually with reminders that the correspondent had better get on with it . " <P> The sittings were punctuated by occasional visits from members of the Westmoreland family . At one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bust in progress and gasped : " Gee , it 's President Lincoln ! " A second look straightened her out , but the awe was gone . " Oh , " she sighed , " it 's only Dad . " The general roared with laughter . From Katherine , 17 , came quite a different reaction . She returned to Honolulu for Christmas vacation proud of the fact that TIME had published a letter from a reader suggesting her father as Man of the Year . When she saw the correspondent and the sculptor she guessed the truth , with a proud daughter 's great delight . <P> When he had turned 50 Ibs. of clay into the finished head , Berks photographed it in a mountain pass outside Honolulu , and then brought it back to New York in a special crate that rode at half price on an airplane seat . He had to evade the curiosity of airline crews and fellow passengers , for not until after this issue went to press was anyone not directly involved supposed to know the identity of the Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
