" A naughty play . . . " " Bitter tirade against women , bitter tirade against men . . . " " Great theater , great truth . . . " " Best play on Broadway . " So critics first hailed Clare Boothe Luce 's The Women , a play that made the reputation of every actress who played in it , from Ilka Chase to Marjorie Main , who had only a walk-on part , and , in the movie version , Rosalind Russell ( " It changed my life completely " ) . Now 30 years and $50 million in box-office receipts later , The Women is one of the few Broadway hits to become a staple in repertory around the world . <P> What has made it endure ? A black-tie benefit audience in Phoenix 's new Theater Center last week got an answer from the playwright herself . " It seems , " she said in a curtain speech , " that women have n't changed . The wise women in the audience will know that is so . If they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll tell you now : it 's because-alas-men have n't changed . " <P> But for the Phoenix benefit . The Women had changed , if ever so subtly . To bring the text up to date for the performance of the 44-girl cast-all played by Phoenician socialite amateurs - Playwright Luce had used her author 's prerogative to pencil in changes . " Look , Schiaparelli ! " became " Look , Balenciaga ! " " No one has mistaken you for Mrs. Harrison Williams yet " was changed to " for Princess Radziwill " ; " I wish I could make up my mind whether or not I like Shirley Temple " was updated to " whether I like the Beatles . " Originally , when the cigarette girl asked , " Wh'd'ya say if I was to tell you I 'm a commyanist ? " , Sadie replied , " Fd say ya was bats . I was a Townsendite . Where 'd it get me ? " Today Sadie says , " I was a Bircher . " <P> <P> The timely rewriting made the punch lines only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there on stage " Miriam " was being played by Barry Goldwater 's sister Carolyn ( Mrs. Bernard Erskine ) , and the bitchy " Sylvia " by Barry 's sister-in-law Sally ( Mrs. Robert Goldwater ) . All of which did not dim the drama of the Act II hair-pulling scene between the two . And when Miriam looked at her arm , into which Sylvia had just sunk her teeth , and cried out , " My God ! I need a rabies shot , " it brought down the house . As for Sally Goldwater , the Phoenix Gazette thought she was the best in the cast : " A polished actress who scores heavily with a bold and brassy interpretation . She 's a knockout ! "
