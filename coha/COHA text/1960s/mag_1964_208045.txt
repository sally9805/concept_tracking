For six months , the dark-suited strangers circulated politely through the newsroom of the Cincinnati Enquirer . <P> Six times an hour they approached each staffer with the same question- " What are you doing ? " Everybody knew who they were : efficiency experts from Chicago 's Alexander Proudfoot Co . Last week everybody knew the result of their visit : it was all too easily measured by the empty space where desks had been moved from the newsroom . <P> Rolling Heads . Among the 24 Enquirer staffers eliminated in the name of efficiency were two photographers , seven newsmen , the editor of the Sunday feature page-and Managing Editor Ralph L. Holsinger . The Proudfoot ax also cut swaths through the classified-ad department ( 15 heads ) and the circulation department ( five ) . Only in the composing room did the efficiency experts fall down on the job-only because the shop foremen flatly refused to let them in . <P> The Cincinnati overhaul began last spring when Proudfoot , which had never before studied a newspaper operation , approached the Enquirer with a confident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of waste effort . The prospect was warmly welcomed by Charles Staab , 60 , the Enquirer 's executive vice president and business manager , and something of a fat trimmer himself : eight years of Staab-inspired wow ( for " Wipe Out Waste " ) campaigns have , among other-things , reduced the mail-room staff by introducing automation . <P> " Excellent Thing . " Although the Enquirer had just chalked up its most prosperous year ( with net earnings of $1,430,324 ) , and is headed for an even better one . Staab decided to go ahead , saying : " You do not take corrective action after the fact . " He expressed delight at Proudfoot 's results . " Our studies showed a pool of people not all of whom were busy all the time . " Survivors will certainly be busier than before-if only in filling out the new work forms on which staffers must make a daily account for every minute of their time . Down in classified ads , an abbreviated force could not stay abreast of the phone calls-a crisis that the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew . <P> Among Enquirer news hands , there were serious doubts that the efficiency of a newspaper , which runs by fits and starts in concert with the uneven flow of the news , could ever be measured by time-and-motion studies .
