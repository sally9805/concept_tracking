Simply arriving at a Larry Ellman restaurant can be a challenge to belief . A diner bound for Manhattan 's Orangerie , for instance , can be picked up and delivered at the restaurant by a customer-service Citron painted all over with orange blossoms . In the foyer he passes a concierge ready to order theater tick ets or call home to see if the wife and children are O.K. Seated on a black vinyl banquette beneath the leaves of a plastic orange tree , he swills down a triple martini poured from a Boodles bottle and served in a pitcher . By then he may or may not be equal to the doubt ful delight of a tough country pate made with pistachio nuts . <P> One day , when somebody writes an encyclopaedia of restaurants , the name Ellman may be close to Escoffier - and not just alphabetically . Auguste Escoffier left the world crepes suzette and peach Melba , but in his own way Larry Ell man is equally inventive . He has given the world the trompe l'oeil restaurant . His idea is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stagecoach Rides . Ellman 's flair for this sort of thing , based on a canny assessment of the average diner , has made him one of the most successful restaurateurs in the U.S. Starting with a $2,000 investment in ten Coke machines in 1949 , Ellman built up a thriving vending-machine and cafeteria business that he sold for $50,000 in 1958 . He then sank the proceeds into a modest Man hattan steak house . He redecorated it in dude-ranch western , renamed it the Cattleman , promoted it fiercely with various gimmicks , including free stage coach rides for the kiddies . The weekly gross quintupled , from $12,000 to $60,000 , within a year and a half . <P> Two years ago , Ellman decided to expand . For $250,000 he bought control of Longchamps , a New York restaurant chain . He incorporated the Cattleman into the chain , and began buying other restaurants , concentrating on decor . His catering empire now includes 115 restaurants in seven states , and will gross an estimated $75 million this year . <P> Sailor Suits . Among his latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schnitzel has been unadorned for decades , and Charles in Greenwich Village , where the menu used to be sensible and the decor genteel . Now Charles has burst into a kind of bordello Byzantine , where a female harpist plucks away and the lighting is too dim to see the food ( not that one would want to ) . So far , mercifully , Ellman has left Luchow 's alone . <P> But at the Steer Palace , near the new Madison Square Garden , diners perch on the observation platforms of fake railway cars . At La Boufferie , waiters dressed in French sailor suits prance amongst the tables while , over the loudspeakers , Tiny Tim sings Tip Toe Through the Tulips .
