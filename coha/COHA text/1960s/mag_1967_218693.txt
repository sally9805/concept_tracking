Those Fantastic Flying Fools is a spirited spoof in the Jules Vernacular . The background is Victorian , the project loony , the destination lunar , and the fun in the jocular vein of Mike Todd 's memorable Around the World in 80 Days . <P> A group of engineers , scientists and charlatans , headed by P. T. Barnum ( Burl Ives ) , decides to shoot the moon with a rocket ship to be sent up by German Genius Gert Frobe . The pilot : blond , bland Troy Donahue , ideal candidate for the world 's first astronaught . Before the plot can get off the ground , two dastardly schemers ( Lionel Jeffries and Terry Thomas ) bet millions that the trip will fail , then try to sabotage the rocket for insurance . Only after some circuitous antique-automobile and bicycle chases and other mandatory sequences for period comedy does launch time occur-accidentally sending Jeffries and Thomas to the moon . Upon landing they learn that they are not alone : the Czar 's men have arrived first . <P> <P> By drawing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's message-what mortals these fools be-nearly scrubs the project . But the detailed sight gags and the cast 's irrepressible energy provide a variety of lunatic fringe benefits . Like the rocket , they go a long way .
