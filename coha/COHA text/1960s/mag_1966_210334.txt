Pierre Cardin is one of Paris ' most creative couturiers , famous as the man who eight years ago first put models in crash helmets , two years ago matched short skirts with stockings and slashed the dcolletages . Nicole Alphand was known as Washington 's hostess par excellence in the Kennedy era , famed for her charm , elegance and political savvy ( TIME cover , Nov. 22 , 1963 ) . Together they are proving an unbeatable team . <P> Despite raised eyebrows at the Quai d'Orsay , Nicole announced her appointment as Cardin 's publicity director soon after Husband Herve Alphand was recalled from his post as French ambassador . Explained Nicole , who has been on the International Best-Dressed List for six years : " It is time that someone did something for Frenchwomen . One should give them the possibility , even on a small budget , to have the stamp of a great couturier . " <P> Optical Illusion . Pierre was also ready for the mass market . Having already launched a women 's line , he decided to branch out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing a full line of custom and ready-to-wear men 's clothes . His men 's fashions now gross $8,000,000 a year , five times the gross of his women 's line . Among Cardin 's customers : Gregory Peck , Cecil Beaton , Yul Brynner and George Hamilton . <P> What 's Pierre 's line all about ? Says Cardin : " My fashion is elegant and sexy for men .

In Manhattan last week to plan a Cardin boutique that opens next September at Bonwit Teller , he was sporting a three-button , single-breasted suit with extra-long coat and high-rising pleated side vents . Cardin also likes slacks with colored stripes up the side , flowered dinner jackets , four-inch-high collars and square hats . It is not , he insists , an Edwardian look : " I never look backward . I design for tomorrow . N'est-ce pas , Nicole ? " <P> " Pierre 's clothes are perfect for women of any age , " clued in the fashion ambassadress , herself wearing a loose-fitting Cardin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hemline . When you are older you have to work harder to find what 's right for your age . Some women do not want to make that effort . Is n't that right , Pierre ? " <P> " I repeat and repeat and repeat that short skirts are fine for women of all ages if they are worn with heavy , matching stockings and shoes . Of course when I design , I think of the youngest age . Today mothers like to copy their daughters . Except for you , Nicole . You are the daughter and your daughter is the mother .
