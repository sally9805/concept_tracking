Letters to The Times Risking War Evaluated It follows , therefore , that if we indicate that we will not fight for our freedom we are in effect surrendering . The Russians repeatedly threaten war . If we are unwilling to meet these threats , we must always accede to their demands . As to the inevitable question of whether it is better to be Red or dead , I maintain these are not valid alternatives . It is likely that if we surrender many of us will be both Red and dead , if Cuban executions and Russian and Chinese purges and liquidations are any indication . On the other hand , a brave show of determination by the United States would very likely avoid an actual war . If we make it quite plain that we do n't intend to surrender and that we have the power to enforce our decision , it is probable that the Communists will back down . Where we have taken such a stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists have , in fact , backed off . Perhaps the Russians are not bluffing and a firm stand might bring nuclear war . I am sure all Americans hope ? this will not happen . Dr. Siekevitz asks if war would be worth its outcome . Is it worth dying for an idea ? Other Americans have thought so . Our country would not exist if , some of its founders had not been willing to die for an idea . Throughout our history Americans have felt the survival of freedom was worth their lives . I assume most of us still feel this way . Part of Plan Dr. Siekevitz challenges anyone to name a specific move by the Soviet Union that would be worth a nuclear holocaust . We must never be trapped into regarding any of the Russian actions as unrelated , independent incidents . They are all part of their grand plan . One of the reasons we have been steadily losing is that up to now we have not regarded single actions as being worth standing up for . At some point we must draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step over it . The sooner the better . Dr. Siekevitz says that , supposing we won a nuclear war , the destruction would be so great that democracy could not survive and we would find ourselves under a dictatorship . In other words , we would be better off if we had surrendered , since at least we would all still be alive . Why must a dictatorship naturally replace freedom following a destructive but victorious war ? I can think of no logical argument which would support such a fantastic , although convenient , theory .

Against All-Digit Dialing User Maintains Additional Letter Combinations Are Possible TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : May I commend you on your Oct. 2 editorial on the subject of telephone dialing , and add what seems to me a crucial point that is seldom stressed . It is utterly incomprehen= sible to me by what process the telephone company concludes that the conversion to all-digit dialing  --  the abolition of exchanges with real names and substitution of numbers ? could possibly increase the combinations usable for dialing . Nonsense ! There will still be exactly the same number of digits and therefore - the same limit to the possible combinations of these digits . Is anyone fool enough to believe that the exchanges that now exist will be expanded : that 288 can have more four-digit combinations following it than BU 8 ; 832 more than TE 2 ; 565 more than LO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort out exchanges called 877 , 878 , 778 , 887 , 788 or 787 ? besides remembering the other four digits , to say nothing of area codes . The rest of us do not . It is argued that some of the digit combinations can not be represented by the first two letters of a word , using the letter distribution of the present telephone . However , upon examination of the dial , it will be seen that there are only three digits , 5 , 7 and 9 , that do n't have a vowel and that therefore might be difficult to combine . Difficult , but not impossible . Exchanges Suggested I suggest that KL , KR , LY , PL , PR and RY could stand for all sorts of interesting exchanges . YSeult and XYlophone would be educational and euphonious . This leaves only one , 9 5 , out of the dozens of twodigit combinations that I will grant does seem to defy being made into a word . In that case , let them use 951 , and through to 959 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary concession ( although some will doubtless maintain that XJ 3 is easier to remember and has infinitely more character than 953 ) . Mat is resented is the telephone company 's evident unwillingness to give any consideration whatsoever to the fact that people feel strongly about their old exchanges ( or even new ones : I have become very fond of YUkon 8 ) , and the fact that exchange names are much less " interconfusable " than digits . The company goes right ahead with all the indifference and arrogance of a force of nature . For all that people 's protests are attended . to , the company , with its policy of creeping ( or sweeping ) dehumanization , might as well be a force of nature ; perhaps it thinks it is . As you stated in your editorial " Phones are for people . " You know it and so do many others , but does the company know it  --  or does it care ? SUZANNE R. BOORSCH . New York , Oct. 5 , 1962 . Fighting Is Declared Preferable to Surrender to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The letter of Philip Siekevitz published Oct. 3 makes the oftrepeated point that nuclear weapons have made war unthinkable . He cites statistics indicating the horrible loss of life in such a war and intimates nothing is worth the risk . In order to accept his argument without believing it means surrender , we must assume that the Communists really do n't plan to conquer the world ; that they have no ultimate designs on the United States . This is unrealistic . Although much has been said lately about the " deterioration " of Communism and its change of heart regarding world domination , the facts appear to . indicate that Communism continues to advance . Can anyone observing what is currently happening in Cuba , for instance , honestly say that Communists have renounced their traditional goals ? We have to reject such a notion . Acceding to Demands Marie Bonaparte 's Work TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : On Sept. 23 The New York Times took note of the death of Marie Bonaparte in a biographical sketch which emphasized her aristocratic origins and made some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this article omitted much that was relevant and which she herself valued most . Marie Bonaparte did not simply meet Sigmund Freud at the railroad station when he arrived in Paris , a refugee from Vienna in 1938 . It was she who , at considerable risk and sacrifice , not only insured his personal security but was responsible tor the fact that the Nazis permitted him to leave Austria . She was not merely a student and close personal friend of Freud and A his daughter , Anna , but a great ? sychoanalyst in her own right .

" gave a very good description of what is meant by so-called " foreign aid . " I suggest that from now on we change this unpopular misnomer into " Foreign Defense , " " Anti-Communistic Aid , " or more specific , " Economic Defense . " MICHAEL M.
