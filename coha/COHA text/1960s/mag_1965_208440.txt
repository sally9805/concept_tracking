Just across Biscayne Bay from Mi ami is the city of Miami Beach . It is scarcely more than a spit of sand held together by a string of hotel resorts , but Miami Beach ( pop . 69,000 ) is big enough to have its own $3,000-a-year mayor , and last week it elected a new one . According to one newspaper , the winner was " the tall , rather pudgy " Elliott Roosevelt , 54 , " five times mar ried , four times a business failure , and second son of a famous father . " <P> Most Miami Beach residents obvious ly did not think of Elliott in these terms . <P> <P> Currently a management and investment consultant , he has been active in civic affairs , launched himself into Florida politics last year by running successfully for Democratic state committeeman . In February he decided to run against Incumbent Mayor Melvin Richard , 53 . <P> The issues , such as they were ( tourism , Miami Beach 's relationship to Dade County ) , never got discussed very much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around denying that he had ever called Elliott a drunk or that he had made nasty cracks about Elliott 's sprightly marital career . For his part , Roosevelt did not exactly try to hide the fact that he was a Roosevelt . His campaign mailings were posted with the commemorative U.S. stamp depicting his late mother ; the envelopes were decorated with the legend : IN A GREAT <P> TRADITION , ELECT ELLIOTT ROOSEVELT . <P> <P> Said Mayor Richard 's wife Janet rather enviously : " If we had stamps with our father or mother on them , we 'd probably have used them too . " <P> More to the point , Elliott concentrated on the city 's South Beach district , home of thousands of retired people who had grown to adulthood during the Depression . To these people , Elliott was simply a Roosevelt , the son of the father of social security . Old pensioners grasped his hand and kissed it , crying , " It 's Mr. Roosevelt , God bless him ! " As it turned out , South Beach 's voters went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made all the difference to Roosevelt ; he beat Richard by 1,409 votes-10,110 to 8,701 . <P> To the very end , Elliott insisted that his name was more of a detriment than a help . " Being a Roosevelt costs you dearly , " he explained earnestly . " My last name did n't help me in this campaign for mayor one bit . Look at my brother Jimmy-he ran for mayor of Los Angeles two months ago , and was beaten 2 to 1 . And he has the same last name I have . "
