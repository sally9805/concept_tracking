One of the most sacrosanct of Latin American sacred cows is state control of production and processing of such fundamental resources as petroleum . Last week Argentina 's President Arturo Frondizi , who is not bullied by sacred cows , took pen in hand and signed a $90 million deal whereby two U.S. companies and one British firm will build Argentina 's first petrochemical plants to produce synthetic rubber and industrial chemicals . In many Latin lands , such action would have brought out the mobs to smash windows and shout " Yankee , no ! " In Argentina , conditioned by three years of watching Frondizi leap from crisis to crisis like Eliza crossing the ice , there was no visible reaction . <P> Disillusioned Daughter . One factor in Frondizi 's favor is his obvious dedication to the immense job of clearing away the economic and political wreckage left by 9 years of Dictator Juan Pern . To get himself elected in 1958 , Frondizi wooed the votes of both the nationalists and Pern 's still-loyal masses , who believed in big government and big giveaways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a sizable injection of foreign capital could save Argentina . He then coolly sought the backing of the bitterly anti-Pern armed forces to force through what he knew was certain to be an unpopular program . <P> Deliberately turning his back on his supporters , Frondizi refused to legalize the Peronistas as a political party , outlawed the Communists , clamped down on the Castroites . He violated every nationalistic precept by dealing with foreign oil companies to develop Argentina 's state-owned oilfields , a task the oilmen proceeded to work at so diligently that Argentina expects to turn from an importer to an exporter of oil this year . He let foreign power companies expand Argentine electric power production , threw open the nation 's iron-ore beds to overseas investors . <P> Inevitably , Frondizi faced crisis after crisis-either from the street or from Argentina 's military brass , increasingly aware of Frondizi 's dependence on them . Street cries he met with strength ; military ultimatums he usually satisfied by allowing an incumbent army Minister to be replaced by the armed forces ' favorite of the moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government by wiggle , dodge and compromise ; his own daughter , convinced that he had jettisoned all principle , moved out of his house . The popular vote of 4,100,000 that carried him to office in 1958 dropped to 3,000,000 for his candidates in the 1960 congressional elections . It may drop even farther in congressional elections next month in the federal district of Buenos Aires . <P> Better Than Even Money . At last count , Frondizi had weathered no fewer than 28 identifiable crises in his relatively short term of office . Yet it is plain that each upheaval is a little less threatening than the one before . It is also clear that none of Frondizi 's opponents feel strongly enough to apply the final measure of pressure needed to turn out Argentina 's lonely and unpopular President . Feelings have become more and more neutral , and one of Buenos Aires ' leading papers now aptly and blandly describes Frondizi as " the President we managed to get . "                @ @ @ @ @
