The East Indian speakers at the rally could barely be heard above the din . Tough-looking Portuguese and Negro youths swaggered about the parade grounds in the Georgetown capital-heckling , booing and shouting obscenities . When the last East Indian speaker stepped up , the mob advanced to the platform , disconnecting the public address system and defying the outnumbered East Indians to do anything . Then the hecklers swarmed toward a car , nearly lynching an East Indian driver because someone shouted : " He 's got a gun . " The gun was a toy pistol . <P> Reason behind this and similar riots is that on Dec. 7 , Britain 's tiny self-governing colony on South America 's northeast hump will elect a new government . The campaign pits Marxist Premier Cheddi Jagan and his 295,000 East Indian followers , who live mostly in the countryside , against an informal alliance of 330,000 violently anti-Jagan whites and Negroes , who control the towns and are led mainly by Georgetown Attorney Forbes Burnham , 41 .

When that failed to daunt the British , he sent his East Indian sugar workers out on a strike that swiftly degenerated into an ugly race war . Hundreds of Negro and East Indian homes were bombed , 173 people were killed , thousands more injured . Sporadic fighting went on for six months until British Governor Sir Richard Luyt assumed emergency power and called in 5,000 tommies . Only then did Jagan call off the strike and order his supporters to register . <P> His campaign has done little to calm the racial passions . His party circulated thousands of copies of a preliminary police report on the activities of Negro counterterrorist groups during the strike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was secret and full of unverified accusations , a so-called Jagan " government commission " put out its own juicy report on Negro violence . Then there is the question of lagan 's Marxism : Cheddi has long railed at the " imperialist " U.S. , while lauding Fidel Castro , trading with
