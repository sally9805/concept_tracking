txt Santiago de Cuba " If the imperialists had given me a job and given my family enough to eat , as the Communists have done , I would be an imperialist today . " This statement by a Cuban guajiro ( peasant ) explains why large numbers of the Cuban peasantry support Premier Fidel Castro and his Communist government . Communism as an ideology is lost on these peasants , but communism as a way of life has meaning . Traveling the Cuban countryside , from western Pinar del Rio Province to eastern Oriente Province , it is clear that many of the peasantry consider their lot in life much improved under Premier Castro . Roars of Approval These peasants roar with ' approval at the mention of the Cuban leader and are quick to indicate that they " live better " under communism and " receive better treatment " than , before . They serve as a base for Premier Castro 's strength . The guajiros were at the lower end of the social order in pre-Castro Cuba  --  often exploited and frequently underfed and unemployed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only promised change but also actually made improvements in their lot . During the past 51/2 years since Premier Castro came to power , Cuba 's peasantry has been raised to a new position in society . Promises of year - round work , regular salaries , and food  --  and clothing for peasants ' families have been fulfilled in some measure . ( Meat Shortages Today the Cuban peasant is assured a weekly income of at least 35 pesos ( $35 at official but artificial dollar-peso rate of one for one ) working on a state farm , in public-works programs , and in other government-managed activities . His livelihood is not as dependent as before on what he could earn cutting sugar cane at harvest time . One peasant at an encampment here for thousands who came to Santiago to hear Premier Castro 's 26th of July speech said : " The most important thing is that my children now have enough to eat . I can recall how it was when I was young . We never had enough to eat . " This food may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is available and at prices the peasant can afford has real meaning . There are , it is evident , frequent shortages in meat products and in some vegetables , but there is always food of some description ? for the countryside . dwellers . " We went several weeks without meat in May , " said a young mother with three small children in Camagtiey Province , " but we had other food . " Premier Castro is aware of the importance of the peasants ' allegiance . He travels frequently to granjas ( farms ) all over the island , but particularly in the central provinces of Matanzas , CamagUey , and Las Villas , and in Oriente . " He wants to visit every granja and get to meet every guajiro in the nation , " said an official in the Institute Nacional de Reforma Agraria ( INRA ) , the agrarian reform institute . " Right now he is off in the Santa Clara area  --  and he will visit 18 granjas today and tomorrow , " the official went on . Visits as Criterion ? Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commented : " Stay here a year and there wo n't be a week that the papers fail to mention at least a dozen or so such visits by the Premier . " No Cuban leader in modern times has taken such active interest in the guajiro and his position . This is a significant factor in Premier Castro 's popularity . However , this does not mean all the peasantry is solidly behind the Cuban Premier . To the contrary , on a- trip through the island this correspondent heard frequent grumblings that promises of change were not coming fast enough and that there were too many shortages , but among the peasantry such comments are drowned out by general support of the government . In addition , while the peasantry may grumble at " the government , " as it did in pre-Castro times , this grumbling generally does not include criticism of Premier Castro . His frequent forays into the farm areas  --  his ability to talk the language of the guajiro and his practice of patient listening to the peasants ' comments  --  endears him to peasantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the countryside as a group are generally Negroes who have for generations faced discrimination and segregation at the hands of government and tthe city dweller . This treatment was the result of the long-existent clash between approaches of city and countryside , but it had clear racial overtones . The role of the guajiros in the Castro society is radically different from what it was before . " They now have a sense of identity they never had before , " said a neutral observer here . Advantage Seen A sugar-cane cutter from Las Villas Province kept emphasizing the point to this correspondent by saying : " The Negro now has a sense of dignity . " This cane cutter , with thousands of similar farmers and their families in the countryside , are the grass-roots support which underpins the Castro government here . The guajiro population numbers in the millions ? and forms the single most solid element on the island upon which Premier Castro can lean . The city dweller may oppose the government , but the country worker tends to support the Cuban leader . Premier Castro is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guajiro firmly believes in Fidel Castro 's revolution . " Why should n't they ? " comments a neutral observer in Havana , " when they are the one element in the society which profits most from the changes which have taken place here .
