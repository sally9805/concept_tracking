Professor Winslow 's living room at Hillsdale , a small New England college . A door at stage right of the back wall leads to the central hallway and the front door , and a door in the side wall at stage left leads to the Professor 's study , into which , though we do not see it , another door from the corridor gives access . The door into the hall is open . A fireplace in the center of the back wall . The room has been furnished in very good taste by the late Mrs. Winslow , a portrait of whom as a young girl hangs over the fireplace . On the table , in a silver frame , is a large photosgraph of her . The Professor 's nineteen-year-old daughter Fran is lounging in an arm-chair reading Mad magazine , with one shoe dangling from her toe . Chuck Chambers , a young instructor , enters from the door to the corridor . He looks more like a student than an instructor : corduroys , sneakers , a jersey , a bristling crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing her position ) . Why did n't you ring ? CHUCK Your father 's always glad to see me . FRAN How do you know I am ? CHUCK That does n't influence me . ( Handing her a copy of Liberation . ) If you can tear yourself away from that garbage , you might care to look at this . It 's got a firsthand account of Alabama . I suppose we ought to have gone . p. 3 FRAN ( taking the magazine ) . I see you 've stopped cleaning your nails ? CHUCK They 'd just get dirty again . FRAN You 've got more blackheads around your nose . You 're the most disgusting object on the campus . CHUCK That 's why I have n't been around lately . I did n't want to disgust you . Do you think I 'm more disgusting than Spooky Simms ? FRAN He at least wears a clean shirt . CHUCK Is that why you see so much of him ? FRAN I do n't . CHUCK You went to the Middlebury game with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's trying to downgrade Father . CHUCK How can he ? Your father 's got life tenure . FRAN They want him to teach Freshmen courses and give up his regular lectures . CHUCK Your father 's an institution . He 's been giving that Shakespeare course for years . FRAN But Spooky is the head of the department , and he can dictate to most of the others . CHUCK I suppose they ca n't stand having your father putting on such a successful show and diverting attention from their goddam explications . I know that they think he 's a ham , and so in a way he is . But I ca n't help respecting the old boy . Your father does n't give a damn about how much of a fool he makes of himself so long as he can put over good literature . When he used to give us Shelley 's Skylark , he 'd flap his arms like this so you 'd expect him to soar off the platform . ( He demonstrates . ) " Hail to thee , blithe Spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every character in Shakespeare from lago to Sir Toby Belch . As Ophelia , he was absolutely priceless . When he read that last poem of Browning 's about greeting the Unseen with a cheer , half the class gave the Hillsdale yell. p. 4 FRAN That never happened . CHUCK They also say he used to do a morris dance with bells on his ankles . FRAN That 's another legend . CHUCK It 's finding that unknown Elizabethan play that 's made them all furious . You think it 's genuine ? FRAN He thinks so . CHUCK Were you with him when he found it ? FRAN No . I was staying in London . He was off on a hike by himself . CHUCK Why has n't he shown it to anybody ? FRAN He wants to edit it himself  --  and he wants to have it acted first . CHUCK Of course : he wants to wow them . He 's playing the Duke , I understand . Well , if it is authentic , they 'll never forgive him ; and if it is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pity that the first production has to depend on the talents of Hillsdale ! Professor Winslow enters stage right . Bone spectacles , an old-fashioned Van Dyck beard , a green velvet waistcoat and an orange silk necktie secured by a ring . He is radiant ; at fifty-four , still full of almost boyish enthusiasm . WINSLOW Well , I think I 've made out a good case ! p. 5 CHUCK You mean about the authorship ? WINSLOW I think there can be no doubt that the play is by Henry Chettle ! There 's nothing about it in Henslowe 's diary , but all the plays were n't commissioned by Henslowe . CHUCK But Chettle was just a hack , and you say that the play is brilliant . WINSLOW Now , look : suppose that nothing had survived except the weaker plays of John Webster , that we knew nothing about his great tragedies . Who could possibly imagine their somber magnificence  --  like a catafalque of rich brocade ? Who could imagine from the pinchbeck of the worst of John Ford his alembicated lyric pathos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers as hacks ? CHUCK There 's a good lyric in The Devil 's Law Case : " Vain the ambition of kings , Who seek by trophies and dead thingsTo leave a living name behind , And weave but nets to catch the wind . " He reads poetry well , not at all in the tone of his conversation . WINSLOW A few good passages , yes  --  but there are good things in Chettle , too  --  and why should not Chettle , too , have written a masterpiece ? We have , after all , only one play of his that 's not a collaboration : a tragedy of revenge , Hoffman , and it 's not unlike the one I 've discovered  --  the same imagery , the same mannerisms of style . p. 6 CHUCK How would you date your play ? WINSLOW A reference to Queen Elizabeth as still alive shows that it must be earlier than 1603  --  and Chettle must have died at some point between 1603 and 1607 . And the play is so much superior to Chettle 's other productions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the culminating work of his life . ( With deliberate smiling slyness , as if he were lecturing to a class . ) But that 's not the whole story . I do n't think that Chettle was alone in the authorship of this play . There are passages that must come from another hand , and I do n't think it could have been anyone so relatively inferior as Middleton or Dekker or Rowley . ( He pauses , but Chuck does not encourage him by asking who he thinks this collaborator might be . ) Now , we know on positive evidence that Chettle had a hand in Sir Thomas More  --  which was also discovered in manuscript  --  and you know who else had a hand . The handwriting shows it conclusively . CHUCK You mean Shakespeare . WINSLOW You 'll tell me what you think when you 've seen it . There are certain scenes in the play that , it seems to me , could only have been written by Shakespeare . CHUCK Where do you see the resemblance ? p. 7 WINSLOW Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battlements at the beginning of Hamlet , Iachimo in Imogen 's bedchamber . There 's a hair-raising night scene at the beginning of the play . And then there 's a scene with the clown that seems to me unmistakable . It 's just the kind of thing that Shakespeare wrote for his favorite comic actor Will Kempe . CHUCK Who 's your clown ? WINSLOW Terry Moran . CHUCK You 're running an awful risk . I hope that he turns up sober . WINSLOW Oh , Terry 's a glorious clown . I always had him do the comics when we read the plays aloud in class  --  he had everybody in stitches . CHUCK And Spooky Simms is your villain , I understand . WINSLOW Not exactly the villain  --  a spy . CHUCK Are n't you carrying type-casting a little too far ? How did you get him to play it ? FRAN He does n't want to be left out of anything , and he wants to propitiate Father . The door bell rings , and Fran goes to answer it . WINSLOW Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has one superb speech  --  one of the best in the play . He does have a real love of literature  --  in spite of what I ca n't help feeling is a rather pedantic tendency to pick away at texts and attempt to find all kinds of things in them that the author could n't possibly have put there . That 's a fashion that will soon pass . The voice of the great poets will always drown out their analysts ! Fran comes back with Spooky Simms . He is pale and blond , in his late thirties . Correct college-campus garb : white buttoned-down shirt , conservative tie , trousers and jacket of different materials . He has earned his college nickname by a certain slightly creepy quality . p. 8 WINSLOW Hello , Ned . I 've just made what I think are some interesting discoveries about our play .  --  And you , I understand , have been doing some very exciting work on Yeats . Spooky salutes Chuck and Fran , but Chuck does not respond . SPOOKY I 've cracked The Wild Swans at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope . SPOOKY I started off on the wrong track : I was looking for symbols of the Mass . CHUCK Yeats was a Protestant with a leaning to ward Theosophy . He was all against Catholic Ireland . SPOOKY That was only incidental criticism . I think there can be no question that he was always a crypto-Catholic . I could show it to you in poem after poem : Kiltartan Cross in the Airman , the Nativity in Among School Children . But that 's not what 's important here  --  it 's the homosexual thing . CHUCK What homosexual thing ? SPOOKY Oh , my dear boy , it 's all there ! The poem is crammed with homosexual allusions . The wild swans  --  Wilde  --  remember that Yeats knew Oscar  --  we do n't know how well . And swans  --  that refers to Proust . Swann 's Way had come out in 1919  --  just six years before the poem . p. 9 CHUCK Yeats did n't read French . SPOOKY He had his ways : Arthur Symons . WINSLOW There 's the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Ned . Rehearsal tomorrow , remember . SPOOKY I 'll be there . Winslow goes into the study , closing the door . CHUCK That 's all a lot of crap , Spooky . SPOOKY Well , give it a close reading . Are the wild swans really swans ? There 's no mention of any females  --  nothing about eggs or cygnets ? ( He reads flatly , with no regard for the poetry . ) " Unwearied still , lover by lover , They paddle in the coolCompanionable streams or climb the air . " " Lover by lover , " you notice . " Among what rushes will they build , By what lake 's edge or poolDelight men 's eyes when I awake some dayTo find they have flown away ? " " Delight men 's eyes . " You see . The swans are , of course , young men , and Yeats is quite specific about them . He tells us that there are " nine and fifty swans "  --  that is , fifty-nine young men . This is of great biographical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swans of Hans Christian Andersen , who were all , you remember , young princes . And Andersen himself was a homosexual . p. 10 CHUCK I thought Yeats was a confirmed hetero . What about Maud Gonne ? SPOOKY Maud Gonne was six feet tall and had a square jaw like a New York policeman . Did you ever see a portrait of her ? A bull dyke , if ever you saw one . CHUCK I wo n't buy that . SPOOKY You have n't seen the whole argument . I 'm doing a paper on it for Contemporary Explications . CHUCK I do n't expect to see it . SPOOKY Of course , your discipline should really have been Classics . It 's a pity they 're so weak at Hillsdale . You had to do it all yourself and be practically an autodidact . Do you have any time for them with your teaching load ? CHUCK Yes : I 'm translating Pindar . SPOOKY From what point of view ? CHUCK From the point of view of putting him into English . SPOOKY In verse ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather an ambitious project ? CHUCK It 's never been adequately done , and I 'm certain that I can do it . SPOOKY I admire your self-confidence , Chucky , but even if you can , I 'm not sure that such an undertaking , quite outside your own field , which is English , is the best possible qualification for advancement in the academic world . p. 11 CHUCK To hell with the academic world ! SPOOKY I suppose you must have felt the temptation to become a professional athlete . I understand you 've had offers from some of the big teams . You 've been doing such splendid work as coach here . It 's such a pity you lost the big game . CHUCK Oh , go screw yourself , Spooky  --  that 's the only way you 'll ever make it . SPOOKY In the first place , if you do n't mind , Chucky , I 'd rather you would n't call me by that nickname in public , as you did the other day . It might have a bad effect on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible in a way that you are not . CHUCK Do n't worry about what you 're called . They 'll soon  --  FRAN Come , come : this is n't a play by Albee ! SPOOKY I 'm afraid I must go , Fran . But what I really called about was to ask you to go to the John Cage concert . FRAN A fun evening ! Funny noises or no noise at all . SPOOKY One ca n't be sure that there is n't something in it . One ought to give it a hearing . FRAN OK . SPOOKY Dinner first ; I 'll come to get you at seven . p. 12 FRAN Make it twenty minutes past . I 'll have to rehearse the Ophelia scene with Father . SPOOKY Very good . Seven twenty , Saturday .  --  Good-bye , Chucky . Chuck does not acknowledge this . Fran leaves the room with Spooky , accompanying him to the front door . Chuck looks after him with angry disgust . He picks up Mad magazine , glances at it , then throws it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his coat , we hear this conversation from the hall . SPOOKY I thought I handled that with dignity . FRAN He is very difficult . But you have to make allowances . SPOOKY Yes , of course .  --  Well , till Saturday . He goes out , and Fran returns . CHUCK He 's getting ready to put the skids under me and your father both . During the conversation that follows , he walks up and down the room . Fran goes back to her chair . FRAN I 'm going to work on him Saturday . CHUCK Butter him up under false pretenses ! FRAN That 's academic life . CHUCK I insulted him just now . p. 13 FRAN And I have to try to defend you . CHUCK They 'd fire me anyway . FRAN I 'm trying to save you . CHUCK I 'm on a higher level than they are , so they hate me . FRAN Well , why do n't you at least look decent ? CHUCK What 's the use ? FRAN Well , for one thing , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a damn about me anyway . FRAN I would n't worry about you if I did n't . CHUCK I tried cleaning up on your account , and I never got anywhere with you . What 's the use ? FRAN That lasted about ten days . CHUCK I thought you promised me something . FRAN Conditions werent favorable then . CHUCK You 'd always find conditions unfavorable . FRAN Then you get sulky and disagreeable . CHUCK I still am . FRAN Well , do n't take it out on other people . Why should you be so rude to everybody ? p. 14 CHUCK You 're pretty sassy yourself . FRAN I 'm part of the picture here . You 're just barely hanging on . CHUCK And your delightful but dotty old father . Trying to make him do Freshmen English  --  wasting time with those delinquents that ca n't read or write till they decide to drop out at the end of the first term . That 's where they 've got me . FRAN I do n't see why you did n't go in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm an even more irritant burr for the kind of people that teach it . And by taking on a frankly menial job , I 'm free to devote my time to it . FRAN I do n't think they can make Father teach freshmen . CHUCK They 'll do everything possible to crab his act . Spooky 's building up a department of anti-humanistic little operators like himself  --  handpicked as inferior to him . And you ca n't go lower than that . He does n't want a brilliant entertainer showing the students that literature can be made exciting . He does n't even care about the prestige of the college . Your father used to be known as the genius who sold Shakespeare to the football men . Now Spooky has flunked half the team for not following his Talmudic interpretations . That 's why we lost the Middlebury game . God help Winky Carter this year if he wo n't believe that Yeats was a pansy . He 's our prize player but a pretty smart guy . p. 15 FRAN I 'm going to make that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHUCK What will be the price ? Your hand in marriage ? FRAN You let me worry about that . CHUCK I never can have a wife because I 'll never have permanent tenure . FRAN You 've done everything possible to prevent it . CHUCK I 'm living like a goddam monk working over a classical manuscript , and I ca n't get anywhere with you . FRAN I 've taught you to blow your nose . CHUCK Do you think that Spooky 's a pansy himself ? FRAN ( shrugs ) . He 's a professional mama 's boy . CHUCK With a tiny little power drive .  --  Mrs. Simms is in the play too ? FRAN She 's Queen Constance of Aragon . CHUCK God ! I 'm afraid it 's going to be a howl.  --  Whenever I see Mrs. Simms , I 'm glad that I do n't have a mother . But you had a nice one , did n't you ? FRAN Yes . CHUCK ( stopping in front of the portrait ) . That 's her , is it ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHUCK She was a pupil of your father 's ? FRAN She never really went to college  --  but she audited a course of his at Barnard . It was quite a romantic affair . Her family were all against her marrying him . He was just a poor English instructor . But they were crazy about one another . CHUCK They say she died of living at Hillsdale . I 've never understood why you stayed here . In my case , it was the best I could do . They gave me a scholarship . FRAN You got your M.A. at Harvard . CHUCK And they hated me there worse than here .  --  But you could have gone to Bryn Mawr or anywhere . FRAN I had to stick by Father . He 's never really gotten over Mother 's death . I thought that he was going to die of despair . He sometimes still thinks she 's around . They spent their honeymoon on a walking trip in England . That 's why he went there last summer . He found some valuable books when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes talks as if she 'd been with him when he discovered this manuscript . She was always sure that some day he 'd do something outstandingly brilliant . CHUCK And I was a bastard and an orphan ! p. 17 FRAN You must n't tell people that too often . CHUCK That 's a very poor joke . FRAN What joke ? CHUCK Orphan-often . FRAN That was n't a joke  --  it was accidental . Do n't have such a chip on your shoulder . CHUCK Why not ?  --  What I meant was I ca n't even imagine growing up in a loving family . And do n't you show off , yourself , with that coming-out stuff either . Your people had it made . I had to do everything myself . FRAN Do n't give me all that again . Winslow comes in from the study . WINSLOW A terrible blow has fallen ! Winky Carter has flunked Physics a second time , and his work is below standard . Ned Simms wo n't even give him a B minus . CHUCK ( to Fran ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wo n't let him take part in any extra-curricular activities . It was n't even worth arguing with the Dean . CHUCK They 're sabotaging the play . This is n't the first evidence of it . WINSLOW Oh , no : I do n't think so . But what are we going to do ? We 've got to get someone for Giovanni , and the opening 's only five days off ! p. 18 CHUCK Sam Defoe ? FRAN Oh , no : he 's a stick , and he mumbles . When he played Hippolytus in Phaedra , nobody could possibly imagine why Phaedra was so crazy about him . WINSLOW You made quite a terrifying Bosola in The Duchess of Malfi , Chuck , and this part needs a certain brutality . CHUCK Get it up in five days ? FRAN You know Pindar and Homer by heart . I do n't see why you could n't do it . WINSLOW Yes , Chuck : you 're just the man . I was never really satisfied with Winky , and I 'm sure that you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reserve that is what the part demands . CHUCK Well , the Middlebury game is over . Let me read the script . Winslow dashes out into the study . CHUCK What do I do in the play ? FRAN You try to carry out a hideous revenge . You 're out to kill the man who murdered your father , but you get killed yourself instead . CHUCK That would be just my luck .  --  Who are you ? FRAN I 'm your girlfriend  --  so take a bath before rehearsals . p. 19 CHUCK What happens to you ? FRAN I go crazy on account of you 're killed . CHUCK A likely story ! Winslow comes back with the script . WINSLOW Can you read it right away ? There 's not a moment to lose ! But please do n't talk about it . All the actors have been pledged to secrecy . CHUCK I 'll let you know tonight . He takes the script and goes out , without further ceremony . WINSLOW I believe that Chuck could be splendid ! FRAN Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of them are dedicated souls . Their approaches , of course , are different ; bur where it 's a question of poetry , such differences are unimportant . I know that Ned does n't approve of my methods , but he 's glad to appear in my play  --  in the play . The competition between theories of interpretation belongs to the small academic world  --  a matter of parochial jealousies . On the great stage of Elizabethan drama , all such rivalries must be forgotten ! FRAN I hope you 're right .  --  I must get on that damn sociology . WINSLOW How abominably they write ! p. 20 FRAN You said it . She goes out by the door into the hall . Winslow turns to the portrait . WINSLOW If only Daphne were here ! I feel that she will be with me on our opening night ! " Oh , lyric love , half-angel and half birdAnd all a wonder and a wild desire "  --  He puts his hands over his eyes and begins to sob . " Cover her face ; mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study is heard . He turns briskly and goes back into the study. @x In front of the curtain , Professor Edgar J. Creech and his assistant Warren Tisdale . They are wearing their hats and overcoats , and both carry umbrellas . TISDALE ( soft-spoken , tactful and very deferential toward Creech ) . I hope that that plane did n't  --  shake you up . CREECH ( loud , harsh , nasal Middle-Western voice ) . I never let anything shake me up . I 've been through much worse than that . I went by freighter to Uppsala in the middle of December once . I had to examine the only existing quarto of The Merry Wench of Westminster . The only time I could get away : Christmas holidays . I had to go by way of the Baltic  --  too expensive by train . Roughest voyage I ever had . TISDALE What a marvelous edition you made of the Wench . I wonder whether this trip will be equally rewarding . CREECH I doubt it . TISDALE You 're evidently the only expert who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , at the present time , you 're the only real expert in the field .  --  One wonders why Winslow has n't shown it to anyone . CREECH One may well wonder . p. 22 TISDALE He now thinks that Chettle wrote it . If it 's as poor stuff as what we have of Chettle , it was hardly worth the finding . CREECH All texts are of equal value  --  if they 're authentic . TISDALE If they 're authentic , of course .  --  I wonder whether he knows you 're here . CREECH He will when he sees me . TISDALE You know him ? CREECH I heard him lecture once . TISDALE What impression did you get of him ? CREECH A mountebank . TISDALE Most popular lecturers are mountebanks . Scholars like yourself are almost extinct  --  they will be when you are gone . Who is there to take your place ? CREECH Nobody . TISDALE I 've at least mastered your method  --  I hope . ( A suggestive pause , but no answer . ) Though I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found to carry on your tradition in the George Hamilton Pratt chair . CREECH You could n't carry it on , if that 's what you 're thinking of . Not only do n't you have the knowledge , you do n't have the necessary character . Scholarship needs lifelong persistence and uninterrupted application . I 've refused to give courses for thirty-five years  --  nowdays I hardly even see graduate students . But you 've become a popular teacher yourself . I do n't say you 're a mountebank yet , but you probably will be eventually . I 'm not leaving you my blessing for the chair , if that 's what you 're hinting at . p. 23 TISDALE ( shocked and crushed ) . May I ask who will have that distinction ? CREECH Nobody : the chair will be abolished . TISDALE How can it be abolished ? CREECH I 've told Pratt I want it abolished , and the money to go thereafter to adding to the Elizabethan collection and keeping my editions in print . TISDALE Is n't that something for the college to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the principal contributor of funds . If it had n't been for him , the little place would have folded long ago . They 've got to do what he tells them .  --  Have you got the tickets ? Tisdale mutely produces them . They take off their hats and coats . A student usher from Hillsdale comes out on the stage right , tears off the stubs and takes the professors to two seats at the extreme right of the stage . During the scene backstage that follows , which they are not supposed to see , Creech examines the program and looks around at the theater , without speaking and in cold indifference . Tisdale , disappointed and miffed , constrainedly studies the program . When the performance proper begins , Creech is seen assiduously taking notes. @x Backstage . Winslow , in the medieval costume of the Duke , is nervously inspecting the stage and the properties . Fran , in the costume of the Duke 's niece Violante , comes to him from a door on the right . FRAN Did you know that Edgar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabethan expert from the West Coast  --  Edgar J. Creech . WINSLOW ( startled and rather upset ) . Edgar Creech from California ? FRAN He 's flown on to see the play . Ned Simms just told me . WINSLOW Oh , I wish I could see him first ! I 'd like to have a little talk with him . FRAN It 's too late for that now . WINSLOW Yes . Dear me ! I hope he does n't expect too much  --  in the way of textual scrutiny . FRAN He does n't look as if he did . I 've peeked at him through the curtain . WINSLOW He 's a very rigorous scholar , and there are passages I 'm still not sure of .  --  I 've always thought him a little uninspired . FRAN Do n't let him throw you off . You can always make anything go . The students are all for you . p. 25 WINSLOW Is Terry Moran on hand ? FRAN Yes . WINSLOW What sort of condition is he in ? FRAN He 'll be tight as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done about him . You 'd better have a talk with him now . Terry Moran appears . He is dressed as the Clown and quite high . TERRY ( clapping Winslow on the shoulder ) . What ho , my good lord ! I come from Joe Turucci 's Mermaid Bar , where a goodly company of whoreson knaves do break jests and quaff canary . They drink to my lord 's noble health . Marry come up with a wannion ! WINSLOW All right , Terry . Are you sure of your lines ? Let 's not have any improvements tonight . The play 's bawdy enough already . Remember Hamlet 's admonition : " And let those who play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them . " TERRY Have no fear , my good lord . This jackanapes will not bebawd the stage , Although the greatest clown of this or any other goddam age ! ( Producing a pint of whisky ) Wilt drink with me , good Duke ? Fran quietly takes the bottle away from him . WINSLOW Try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut that scene we have together . And I know you can be so good in it . You do n't want to spoil the performance . Please . p. 26 TERRY ( in his natural voice ) . Do n't worry , sir , I 'll be all right . WINSLOW Go out and get a breath of air . These tiny little dressing rooms are stifling . Spooky and Chuck appear in the costumes of Perfidio and Giovanni di Procida . TERRY ( gesturing towards Spooky ) . There struts the horrid villain , mean and base ! Dids't ever dig so sickening a face ? WINSLOW This is not a melodrama , Terry , but a tragedy of revenge . You 've never seen the whole of the play . ( To Fran ) Take him out into the open air . She leads Terry out . WINSLOW ( to Chuck ) . Are the Skeletons all sober ? CHUCK More or less . During the conversation that follows , seven Skeletons straggle in . They wear black dominoes , with the bones in white . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a large ewer , and two carry musical instruments . SPOOKY ( pretending to joke with the Skeletons ) . Well , boys , if you 'd tried that costume on Middlebury , you might have scared them and not lost the game . The Skeletons give him only sour looks . p. 27 WINSLOW ( after looking the Skeletons over , to Chuck ) . Do the curtains for the inner stage work ? CHUCK I do n't think we 've tried them out tonight . WINSLOW They got stuck at the last rehearsal . We 'd better see about them . He goes behind the stage . Spooky addresses Chuck in a quiet but distinct voice , loud enough for the Skeletons to hear . They soon begin to listen attentively . SPOOKY Well , old boy , you 've got some good news coming to you ! ( Chuck looks at him suspiciously and apprehensively . ) You might as well hear it right away . You 've been called , as the preachers say , to Steep Rock College in Tennessee . I had an interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their English Department  --  their best man got killed skiing  --  and I recommended you . I 've had a feeling that you were hoping to do Classics here  --  CHUCK No , I was n't . SPOOKY Well , there 's less and less call for them nowadays , and old Thaddeus Winterfield takes care of the few students that want them . Even when he retires , you could hardly take his place , because , unfortunately , you have n't the academic qualifications . You know the situation here . There really is n't any place for you . You 're frankly hostile to the policies of our department , and we 've made the decision , with much regret , that we 'll have to let you go . On the Rock , as they call it , you 'll be supreme . You can formulate your own policies . To be sure , it 's a bit isolated  --  a touch of Mount Athos , they say . But it 's perfectly accessible by ski-lift , and there 's a certain dedicated spirit  --  teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idealism . And then , they need an athletic coach . The President is very ambitious for the athletic side of the college . He says that the students , in general , are splendid physical specimens . The defeat of your team this fall was regrettable , but at the Rock you 'll have fresh material . You can teach them football from the ground up  --  you wo n't be threatened by serious competition . And the salary is not contemptible . They 're handsomely endowed , you know . You could n't have a better stepping-stone to what I hope will be higher things . p. 28 CHUCK Going up in the ski-lift , you mean ? SPOOKY ( self-consciously laughing ) . Oh , in that sense , I think Steep Rock is high enough . The first bell to give the actors notice rings . Chuck says nothing further and walks out . The Skeletons go out on the left to take their places on the inner stage . SKELETON Did you hear that ? He 's firing Chuck . SECOND SKELETON It was all Spooky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season . He disqualified half the team last spring . Mrs. Simms , Spooky 's mother , appears from the dressing room . She is dressed as Queen Constance of Aragon and wears a Spanish mantilla . She is a sharp New England woman , who wears an old-fashioned pince-nez and speaks with extreme precision . SPOOKY I 've just broken the news to Chuck Chambers . MRS . SIMMS How did he take it ? SPOOKY Not very well , I 'm afraid . He has a certain resentment against me . I hope it wo n't upset him in his part . MRS . SIMMS It 'll be a good riddance so far as I 'm concerned . That young man gives me more trouble than anybody else at the library . He keeps the books out for weeks and pays no attention to my notices . When he brings them back , they 're all scribbled up . He 's also exceedingly insolent. p. 29 SPOOKY I know he is , Mother , but you have to remember his unfortunate circumstances  --  his birth and his early struggles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play itself , you and he are supposed to be on the same side . The bell rings again. @x In front of the curtain . Winslow , in the costume of the Duke , with his usual horn-rimmed glasses , which now give him something of the look of Greco 's portrait of the bearded and bespectacled Cardinal de Guevara . He reads , with vivacity and gusto , a prologue spoken in his own character . WINSLOW In cold October , yet with blood aglow , Like Borrow 's footloose vagrant Lavengro , Undaunted by damp mists and murky mires , I trudged through lank old England 's northern shiresBy ways no blaring billboards yet had marred , By gentle lanes no motor-horns had jarred , Waked only by the hunter 's ringing halloo ; The grass still green when ours is sere and sallow ; Old houses that must harbor each its ghost ; Old cosy country inns in which mine hostServes mellow ale and steak-and-kidney pie , A faithful fire of coals bright burning nigh . So faring , with a rucksack on my back , Beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lovely town at lastThat seemed a remnant from the vanished past:No Boots , no modern bars , no petrol smell ; A faceless castle little but a shell ; A church with belfry steeple-lopped and squared , The ravages of Cromwell scarce repaired  --  Blackened without and mortal chill within ; The sacristan lugubrious and lean ; Old tombs of nobles lying blurred and chipped , Squat Norman arches crouching in the crypt . ' T was here that , after supping hungrily , On buttered scones , sardines on toast , and tea , Served by firm-bosomed lasses , never slimmed , Sloe-eyed and pert-nosed such as Hogarth limned , I found a bookshop piled with ancient trashDragged from dark attics for a bit of cash ; The wheezing dealer , bleary-eyed and sad , Dull-witted , hardly knowing what he had.Yet , grubbing there in dust , I brought to lightThese precious items , buried out of sight:Clarissa . London , seventeen fifty-one , " Printed for "  --  that is , by  --  " S. Richardson " ; A handful of Marprelate tracts that spanThe comic quarrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notingMy eyes agleam , my exclamations gloating  --  A manuscript part-crumbled did produce:Elizabethan loops and curlicuesOf which he could make nothing , but to me The True and Lamentable Tragedie Of sad Palermo 's Duke , a work unknown , No date , no author  --  left for me alone ! Curbing excitement  --  what a day of killings !  --  I bought the lot for two pounds and eight shillings ; And all night pored with ever-growing glee , Since years before I 'd won my Ph.D.On Henry Chettle  --  not an obscure hack , As some suppose who true discernment lack , But one who brought a touch of somber gloryTo German Hoffman 's harsh and bloody story.I recognized his favorite darkling phrases:The purple blood , the windy blasts  --  where blazesA fury of Satanic eloquence  --  In Hoffman , still half-smouldering , though intense , Which , in Palermo , might perchance arouseA mounting horror that would rock the house ! This we present tonight , as best we may:Our faults , our fallings-short forgive , we pray.I have said that Chettle must have penned this piece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all unaided , we demand , Or had he , then , the help of some far greater hand ? The subject of The Duke of Palermo I have found to be more or less historical : the rising of Sicily against the French  --  the so-called Sicilian Vespers  --  at the end of the thirteenth century . For the purposes of this performance , we are forced to omit the subplot , which , brilliant though it is in its way , has , nevertheless  --  as is often the case in the Elizabethan dramas  --  little relevance to the main story and which would involve us in too long an evening . He bows and withdraws. @x A trumpet call . The girl who plays Lucia , a small brunette , passes across the stage with a placard reading : " A Castle in Italy . " Half-way across , she stops and displays it , then walks out at the other side . The curtain goes up . Chuck and Terry , as Prince Giovanni di Procida and the Clown , at the front of a darkened stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him as if at a high spacious chamber . CHUCK-GIOVANNI Here where my father , German Conradin , Kept kingly state and ruled with equal hand Jerusalem and sun-bak 'd Sicily ; Where once in childhood , munching sugarplums , I frisk 'd upon the flower 'd terraces , Chas 'd butterflies and lov 'd to play crusader With mimic weapons , heedless of the wars That France and Italy in hate did wage ' Gainst one another . After twenty years I come again , Giovanni of Procida , A poor and petty prince , to find all dark , Decayed and cobwebb 'd , smelling dank of death , Ruin 'd and robb 'd by Charles the Angevin , Vile Frank , the slayer of my noble sire . A thunderclap.Methinks Jove rages at th ' abhorrent deed ! Hark how he thunders ! A prolonged flash of lighting illuminates the scene , revealing , on the inner stage , a banquet table , at which five of the Skeletons are sitting , two on either side , and at the head , facing the audience , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which wears a crown  --  also facing the audience  --  is set before the Skeleton to which it belongs . All are grasping large goblets , which rest on the table . Behind and to the right of the headless host , stands the cupbearer with his ewer . The two musicians stand , to the fore , on either side of the inner stage . p. 33 CHUCK-GIOVANNI Look there ! What do I see ? TERRY-CLOWN A deadman 's banquet , by'r lady ! Let 's hence ' fore they ask us to drink with them ! CHUCK-GIOVANNI Draw nigh and light this grisly spectacle . Terry-Clown holds up the lantern but does not approach too near . CHUCK-GIOVANNI What hollow sconces and dull orbs are these That , mouldering , sit mumchance in this place ? What vacant cheer and dismal revelry ? Sure Charles of Anjou rigged this ghostly show , Made thus our banquet hall a charnel-house , In mockery of my father 's majesty . There sit the guests , there stands the cupbearer , There the musicians with their tuneless strings , As many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arras , I have seen A richly clad and courtly company , Wittily jesting as the wine went round , My father leading all in gay discourse . TERRY-CLOWN I ' faith , were those fleshless chaps to drain a cup , ' t would splash bare ribs and never bring a belk ! Thunder and lightning . CHUCK-GIOVANNI But look : that skull doth bear a rusted crown ! Draw nigher . Terry-Clown reluctantly does so . ' T is the crown my father wore ! His lordly head , lopped by the Angevin  --  Faith 's temple , wisdom 's tower . But he bore it Too high for such a crouching beast to brook . Thunder somewhat fainter . p. 34 THE SKULL My son , first scion of my loins . CHUCK-GIOVANNI It speaks . TERRY-CLOWN If I must be with bones , godsookers , I would rather they kept silence ! CHUCK-GIOVANNI Be still . ( To the Skull ) Speak on . THE SKULL My son , thou knowest well How , worsted by French Charles at Tagliacozzo , For that our gluttonous troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ta'en , Condemned as a base traitor and beheaded . But now this head , dissever 'd from its frame , Set here for scorn , doth still defy its foe And bids its seed take vengeance . Let no even Her curtains draw on our fair Sicily That brings you not the nearer to just vengeance Against her ravisher and my murderer . Long have I waited thee . The hour is come Foretold me ere my death by birds of omen , Black messengers , in croaked syllables To swear my squander 'd blood should leap again . Behold it burns in thee . I can not kiss thee With these foul chops , but proudly hail thy coming . Now swift away ! Seek out Palermo 's Duke , Who Charles 's insolence would fain rebuke  --  Stanch friend , who mid these ills which others whelm Our honor guards in Charles 's bloodied realm . Avenge , avenge , avenge ! THE SKELETONS ( raising their goblets , as if to drink to Giovanni 's success ) . Avenge , avenge ! p. 35 CHUCK-GIOVANNI ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seek the Duke 's support .

Spotlight on Tisdale and Creech . Tisdale , now angry with Creech , is prepared to take an opposite line from him . TISDALE Conradin had no issue . He was the last of the Hohenstaufens . Giovanni di Procida was not his son . But of course the Elizabethans were careless about such matters . CREECH What 's more serious is that the expression " godsookers " is n't found as early as Chettle . It first occurs in Buckingham 's Rehearsal : 1672 . TISDALE Buckingham ca n't have invented it , though . It 's the same thing as " gadzooks , " which is all through the Elizabethans . CREECH It is not the same thing . And why that Alexandrine at the end ? TISDALE They did write them as early as that . CREECH Not like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spenserian stanza perhaps set a precedent for doing so ? No reply from Creech. @x Lucia crosses the stage with a placard which reads : " Palermo . Palace of the Duke . " The Duke is seen at his writing table . WINSLOW-DUKE In what cribb 'd crush 'd condition do I dwell Beneath these coffer 'd roofs which hous 'd my sires , Behind gates , pillar 'd with our plumed arms , That now we scarce dare pass lest some foul insult From jeering Frank deride our ducal state . They flout us and degrade us . We are slaves . We slink like timid mice that fear grimalkin Who preened as fierce as falcons in our pride . Our nobles must run errands for low strangers ; The flower of our youth , clapp 'd in dark pantries , Must turn the spit like scullions , fetch rare cates For gibbering fribbles , while they sup themselves On scraps and orts . They must e'en comb the fens For creaking frogs , the fields for slimed snails That furnish the pale Franks their filthy fare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All Sicily for the coin to pay their riots And sate their lusts . They search the very huts Of those sweet shepherds of Theocritus Who pipe to their placid flocks beside the sea .  --  Ah , would Enceladus , the swarthy Titan Who sleeps in Etna 's bowels might belk forth His burning hail and bury with these tyrants All that was once most great in Sicily And now is brought to measliness ! Or might Some young and molten-marrowed champion , Whose fiery words could blister men like lava , Burst forth and blast our people to rebellion ! I am too old to fulminate this foray . A Servant enters . p. 37 SERVANT A friar would have speech with you , my lord . WINSLOW-DUKE Whence comes he ? SERVANT From Messina , my good lord . WINSLOW-DUKE A friend or foe ? What thinkest thou ? SERVANT I know not . His dark eyes burn like coals , his breath comes short , As if he were a-fever 'd . WINSLOW-DUKE Search him well . Perchance he flees Messina , where the French Do now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . But make sure he be not Some fell assassin in a friar 's garb . SERVANT He bears beneath his robe some bulky object . WINSLOW-DUKE A weapon ? Look to this. I will , my lord . He leaves by a door on the right . Fran-Violante enters at the Duke 's left through the curtains that mask the inner stage . FRAN-VIOLANTE A letter from Lucia , good mine uncle , By night and slyness smuggled out of NaplesBy our shrewd Sicilian fisher . Much I fearLest she herself be spied on , apprehended , And ne'er fly back to us , our pretty birdThat pipes so linnet-sweet yet hops as waryAs any sparrow foraging for crumbs . p. 38 WINSLOW-DUKE He is too confident , the Angevin , Too dull to see what stirs , too deaf to hearThe mutterings that do mount beneath his throne , Like some dim pharos loading a tall cliffWhich the sea , storming , loudly undermines.  --  What news from Naples ? FRAN-VIOLANTE Charles prepares his shipsTo ascend the Rhone , snatch Arles , then launch a fleetAgainst Byzance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reappears . SERVANT The friar , my lord  --  he bears an ebon box , And in that box a hollow skull  --  no weapons . WINSLOW-DUKE Such grim reminders the Franciscans cherish . Admit him . The Servant ushers in Chuck-Giovanni , disguised as a Franciscan monk . He carries a large black box . CHUCK-GIOVANNI Hail , good duke . WINSLOW-DUKE What wouldst thou with me ? CHUCK-GIOVANNI My lord , I do but crave a privy word , Not to be witnessd nor overheard . WINSLOW-DUKE This is my lady niece . You may speak as free When she is by as you may speak with me. p. 39 CHUCK-GIOVANNI Then hark , my lord . No holy friar I ! ( He throws off his hood . ) Not one who begs in dim humility , Not one who drips Christ 's pity , but a princeWho , clad in russet , comes to claim revengeAnd princely cloth of gold . Look here , my lord ! He opens the ebony box and produces the Crowned Skull . Fran-Violante registers astonishment and horror ; Winslow-Duke eyes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHUCK-GIOVANNI The head of Conradin  --  And I his son , Giovanni of Procida ! WINSLOW-DUKE ( grasping his hands ) . I knew thee as a babe ! How cam'st thou here ? CHUCK-GIOVANNI I come with Spanish Pedro at my back , Who claims usurpd Sicily by the right Of Constance , Manfred 's daughter , his fierce queen . She sails in secret and should meet me here . The Servant enters . SERVANT A lady waits without . CHUCK-GIOVANNI Hath she green eyes , A queenly carriage and an emerald ring ? SERVANT All three she hath , good father . p. 40 WINSLOW-DUKE Let her come in . Mrs. Simms-Constance makes a stiff entrance , as the Servant turns to escort her . WINSLOW-DUKE Hail , madam , gracious queen . MRS . SIMMS-CONSTANCE All hail , good Duke . I come to claim mine own , to wrest my realm , Rough Sicily , from the Angevin .

MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t is well.Me Manfred also calls , Tarentum 's Prince , Conradin 's Regent , lord of Sicily , And rightful Emperor of Italy.In sleep he did me visit , bade me haste , With strong and tearing talons , eagle-like , To gripe and gut these Franks as they do frogs ! WINSLOW-DUKE An eagle ? Nay , a crested cockatrice , As once I saw it on an arid plainTransfix by its horrid look a hunter there , Who had glimps 'd it not before he met its stare.Had he seen it first , ' t would have been the other way:The man might still be living to this day . ( To the audience , falling into his classroom habits . ) If the cockatrice saw you first , you were gone . p. 41 FRAN-VIOLANTE ( whose admiration for Giovanni has been obvious ) .

WINSLOW-DUKE Yes , we must lay our schemes . He nothing braves who only bides and dreams . CREECH " Bulky object . " The adjective bulky did n't come into use till the late 1680 's . TISDALE I wonder whether " creaking frogs " may not be a misreading for " croaking frogs . " CREECH One would have to see the manuscript . TISDALE If it is a misreading  --  which seems possible  --  the manuscript may be authentic . He glances sidelong at Creech , who does not reply. @x Placard : " The Duke 's Garden .

FRAN-VIOLANTE You do me too much honor , gentle sir , To come so often to our stricken house , Where rings no mirth nor music as of old , Where sunlight scarcely enters . SPOOKY-PERFIDIO My sweet lady , No place is cheerless where your eyes do shine ; There needs no other music where your voiceSounds softer and more melting than the lute . FRAN-VIOLANTE Your compliments take all too far a flight : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us sit upon this bench and drink the moonlight . Bright Luna , how she silvers every leaf ! The trees are hung with tinsel ; every stem And petal is with tinfoil over-ic 'd . Rose , olive , e'en the tremulous mimosa Scarce stir in this calm air that nothing sways , Yet waft abroad their aromatic fragrance . In this sad moment , we may envy England For that upon her thriving state and mart Another Dian sheds her steady radiance And warrants peace while Sicily knows it not . FRAN-VIOLANTE E'en Rome 's mad tyrants spake their subjects ' tongue . Chuck-Giovanni appears and stands listening . p. 43 SPOOKY-PERFIDIO And yet I almost think we are irked too much By these discordant sounds . Were't not the wiser course To learn their Frankish speech , so like to ours , And thus with courteous grace and argument Persuade and cozen these unwise invaders , Who scorn to learn a language not their own .

I loathe his guts . WINSLOW-DUKE ( correcting this departure from the text ) .  --  " as at the sting " FRAN-VIOLANTE I shrink and tremble then , as at the stingOf some much-fawning yet envenom 'd thing . WINSLOW-DUKE I find him faithful , though he woos the FranksAs well as thee , so let us have no pranksThat might rebuff him .
