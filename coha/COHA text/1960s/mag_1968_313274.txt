FRED L. NORMANDIN JR . Forest Grove , Ore . <P> <P> Sir : The main reason for the high crime rate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laxity and slow process of the courts in punishing offenders . The gun run now in progress is certainly not being carried out by potential criminals but rather by citizens who wish to protect themselves and their families , since they can no longer depend on the authorities to do this job . Before we do something foolish in a time when we are guided by our emotions rather than our reason , we may do well to recall the words of Benjamin Franklin : " They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety .

I refer to a letter addressed to N.R.A . members from the office of President Glassen , dated June 14 , 1968 , in which he urges " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their Senators and Congressmen . Glassen further states that the ultimate goal of said gun legislation is complete abolition of civilian firearm ownership . <P> If nothing else , friend Glassen clearly won the Loudmouth of the Week Award .

MAURICE <P> Simi , Calif . <P> Sir : Your excellent article on guns referred to my study of homicide in Philadelphia in 1958 and quoted a statement the National Rifle Association has often used to suggest that I , as a criminologist , favor their position about gun legislation . You further indicated that " Wolfgang has since modified that view . " <P> My views on guns have never been modified , for I have consistently favored the most restrictive gun legislation the Government can obtain from Congress . <P> My personal choice for legislation is to remove all guns from private possession . I would favor statutory provisions that require all guns to be turned in to public authorities . Citizens could be compensated for their loss at a standard rate based on the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain depositories for guns . Members would be able to sign out for their weapons at stipulated times but be required to return them to the depositories.
