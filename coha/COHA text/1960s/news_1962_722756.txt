P. county ticket , the records indicate . The G. 0 . P. scored victories for most county candidates with a turnout of 80.60 per cent in 1946 , and with a turnout of 80.06 per cent in 1950 . Denis Expect 85% Ilere Democratic election officials here look for an ? 85 per cent turnout in Chicago and 79 per cent in the suburbs . G. 0 . P. county candidates were clobbered In off-year 1954 when the turnout was 74 per cent , and in 1958 , when it was 72.64 per cent .
