txt WASHINGTON , Nov. 22 ? Presidents of the United States in the past have included foreign press correspondents in the very few exclusive-interviews they have given , and these rare journalistic items have been published in full and generally reprinted . One of the handful was the famous interview of Woodrow Wilson by George Adam . Paris correspondent of The Times of London , soon after the President arrived in France for the Allied summit peace conference after World War I. But the forthcoming interview President Kennedy has granted to the editor of Izvestia is unique in the short series for these reasons : The Moscow newspaper is an arm of a government , and one whose relations with the United States are strained . Its editor , like the rest of the staff , is a Government employe and subject to totalitarian official controls . And in the case of Izvestia this official control is the shortest and surest of any such chain of command because the editor , Aleksei I. Adzhubei , is the son-in-law of the controller in chief , Premier Khrushchev . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union to publish the whole of the interview , although a consequence may be to apprise the Russian people of events in United States - Soviet relations that have been withheld from them or officially distorted . It is true that the meanings in English of many words have no precise Russian equivalents in even the most meticulous translation ; and that many English words and phrases which have precise equivalents express entirely different political concepts : for examples , " freedom , " " democracy , " " peaceful coexistence , " " a free press . " But President Kennedy is very much aware of these linguistic obstacles . The evidence is his remark at a news conference that the first requirement in exploring the prospects of constructive negotiation of East-West differences is to " see if we can get a more precise definition of the phrases and words and thoughts which the Soviet Union has expressed in the matter of Berlin , Germany and Central Europe . " He can be relied on in his conversation with editor Adzhubei to make his own definitions clear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consequently , assuming that the questions from Izvestia will be pertinent to the conflict between East-West international policies , the product of the interview will justify Mr. Kennedy 's decision to make probably the first Presidential use of Government-controlled journalism as the vehicle of a major public information medium developed by the free press . Calculated Boldness Viewed from any aspect , this is a bold venture into democratic practice by Izvestia , which is to say , the Kremlin . For there can be no question that the approval of highest authority was necessary before the project could be undertaken and the preliminaries of feeling out the atti-1 tude of the White House begun . And , since the risks to Soviet anti-American propaganda and Moscow 's selective public informational method were plainly visible , it is certain that these were fully reviewed , and the questions to be asked of the President most carefully processed , before the go-ahead signal was given to Adzhubei . But Premier Khrushchev is a bold man , and his sonin-law gives the same impression . On the other hand , the interview presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were prompt to see and the President is wholly capable of ex ? ploiting . While the White House in this instance has agreed to an exclusive Presidential interview which has no precedent because of the governmental status of the journalistic medium and the interviewer , the action conforms to an informational policy Mr. Kennedy has greatly expanded from that of his predecessors . Press requests for legitimate information that used to stop at the desks of subordinates are being fielded to the President in greater numbers than previously when he alone can supply authoritative answers and the news conference channel is not shortly available . And Mr. Kennedy 's evaluation of the merit of such questions is fair and even generous . In further conformity to this policy the President has given occasional exclusive interviews to British , French and United States representatives of press and radiotelevision ? a past practice so rare that each use of it was an important event in journalism . But for the reasons stated the Izvestia interview can become that .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
