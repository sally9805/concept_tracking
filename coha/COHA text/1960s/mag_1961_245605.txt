When Mobilist Alexander Calder was only a tot 60 years ago , he would solemnly announce to those he had just met : " I am the third Alexander Calder living and the ninth dead . " <P> To be the third living Alexander was something of a burden , for both his father and grandfather were sculptors famous in their day , and the implication was that he would have to carry on . He did . Last week , in a sentimental show , the Delaware Art Center in Wilmington put on a display of works by all three men . Alexander IX 's mobiles were as engaging as ever , and the ancestral works were not without a certain stalwart charm of their own . <P> An Earnest Hero . Grandfather Alexander Milne Calder was born in Scotland in 1846 , worked for a while as a mason in Aberdeen before taking off for the U.S. at the age of 22 . Calder vaguely remembers him as " a remote , awe-inspiring ( because he worked on such huge things ) figure for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among his most famous works , a model of which is in the show : an erect , earnest-looking young William Penn who stands to this day , every bronze ruffle and curl in p ! ace , on top of Philadelphia 's city hall . <P> Between them , Grandfather Calder and his son Alexander Stirling decorated a good deal of Philadelphia . " The public use of sculpture is its highest field and goal , " said Stirling Calder , and he turned out everything from a battle-dressed Leif Ericson , which the U.S. gave to Iceland , to George Washington on the arch in Manhattan 's Washington Square . But the warm talent of the man is best seen in a statue of a chubby little boy that he called Man Cub . The stark-naked cub : the future mobilist . <P> A Moving Mondrian . Having been brought up in the shadow of two traditional sculptors , the third Calder was a bit bored with the idea of becoming one himself . He started out to be an engineer . In the 1920s he began making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , produced a series of wire goldfish bowls in which the fish swam rhythmically back and forth at the turn of a crank . Out of his contact with Mondrian , he wanted to do " a Mondrian that moves . " Thus the mobile . <P> Father Calder never quite understood what his son was up to , but he raised no objection . He died in 1945 , just two years after Calder had his first big one-man show at Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art . The fame of the third Alexander Calder , the father of two daughters , was now the greatest of all , but his own mother , who died last year , could never quite believe it . " You should have seen his father . " she once told a critic . " He was a real sculptor . "
