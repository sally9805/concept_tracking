Legend had it , that many thousands of years ago , right after the Great Horror , the whole continent of the west had slowly sunk beneath the West Water , and that once every century it arose during a full moon . Still , Captain Hinrik clung to the hope that the legend would not be borne out by truth . Perhaps the west continent still existed ; perhaps , dare he hope , with civilization . The crew of the Semilunis thought him quite mad . After all , had n't the east and south continents been completely annihilated from the great sky fires ; and was n't it said that they had suffered but a fraction of what the west continent had endured ? The Semilunis anchored at the mouth of a great river . The months of fear and doubt were at end . Here , at last , was the west continent . A small party of scouts was sent ashore with many cautions to be alert for luminescent areas which meant certain death for those who remained too long in its vicinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way slowly up the great river . Nowhere was to be seen the color green , only dull browns and greys . And no sign of life , save for an occasional patch of lichen on a rock . After several days of rowing , the food and water supply was almost half depleted and still no evidence of either past or present habitation . It was time to turn back , to travel all the weary months across the West Water , the journey all in vain . What a small reward for such an arduous trip ... just proof of the existence of a barren land mass , ugly and useless . On the second day of the return to the Semilunis , the scouting party decided to stop and investigate a huge opening in the rocky mountainside . How suspiciously regular and even it looked , particularly in comparison to the rest of the countryside which was jagged and chaotic . They entered the cave apprehensively , torches aflare and weapons in hand . But all was darkness and quiet . Still , the regularity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or otherwise , must have planned and built this ... but to what end ? Now the cave divided into three forks . The torches gave only a hint of the immensity of the chambers that lay at the end of each . They selected the center chamber , approaching cautiously , breath caught in awe and excitement . The torches reflected on a dull black surface which was divided into many , many little squares . The sameness of them stretched for uncountable yards in all directions . What were these ungodly looking edifices ? The black surface was cold and smooth to the touch and quite regular except for a strange little hole at the bottom of each square and a curious row of pictures along the top . They would copy these strange pictures . Perhaps back home there would be a scholar who would understand the meaning behind these last remains of the people of the west continent .
