Any school that sets out to teach rabbits to act like tigers figures to have a high flunk-out rate . When it comes to that kind of attrition , there are few schools to match the one that is run semiannually by the Professional Golfers ' Association . The P.G.A . " rabbits " are would-be touring pros seeking to qualify as " Approved Tournament Players " and earn the right to compete for fame and fortune with the veteran " tigers " of the tournament trail . <P> The school was organized three years ago to keep the masses of ever hopeful , but hopelessly outclassed golfers from cluttering up tournament qualifying rounds , and also to make certain that those who do play , know how to act . Just getting into last week 's spring session at Palm Beach Gardens , Fla. , took some doing . The 82 aspirants from 20 states and six foreign countries all boasted impressive golfing credentials : Oklahoma 's Bob Dickson was the winner of both the U.S. and British Amateurs last year ; Colorado 's Hale Irwin Jr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a former member of his nation 's Walker Cup team . But laurels alone were not the price of admission . Each student had to be personally recommended by his own local or national P.G.A. ; he had to cough up $250 for tuition and $125 for a year 's P.G.A . dues , and he had to show a bank balance ( or a sponsor 's pledge ) of $7,500-enough to cover his expenses for six months on the pro tour . <P> What he got for his money was three days of stern classroom lectures , six exhausting days of golf , and a better than 80% probability that he would flunk the course . Seasoned pros lectured on " Building a Professional Image , " on " Ethics and Conduct , " on proper attire ( " Yellow socks , red pants and green shirts do n't coordinate " ) , on clubhouse etiquette ( " Do n't kick in your locker after a bad round ; lockers cost money " ) , and on behavior in front of TV cameras ( " Remember , fellows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touring pros were taught how to negotiate favorable contracts with sponsors and equipment manufacturers , were warned against cursing , throwing clubs , failing to honor commitments or writing rubber checks-any of which can get a pro fined from $100 to $500 , or even bounced off the tour . <P>
