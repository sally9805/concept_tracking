The curtain rises on a projection : an enormous color slide of a smiling baby . The stage is dark and voices come out of the darkness . Everybody " oohs " and " ahhhs " at the projection . BARRY That 's little Will at six months . GRACE Eight months , dear . Even little Will was n't that big at six months . BARRY Seven months then . What a big bad bandit of a boy , eh , Miss Sympathy ? MISS SYMPATHY An alert child . BARRY ( Clicks slide changer . ) Next slide please . ( The projection changes . ) There he is at only one year ! Did you ever see such a rough and tough customer , Miss Sympathy ? GRACE fourteen months , dear . BARRY Thirteen months . MISS SYMPATHY He does seem like an alert child . BARRY Alert ?

The projector is behind them being operated by Millie , the Negro maid . She , expressionlessly , begins to wheel it off. ) p. 3 BARRY Our fallout shelter ! Wait till you see it !

For example , I 've had cards made up with the names of our favorite shows and at the time they would ordinarily go on , we run a picture  --  a slide picture on the screen showing the title of the show  --  GRACE Gunsmoke  --  Bonanza  --  BARRY And during the hours those shows normally run , we sit and reminisce about our favorite episodes . p. 4 MISS SYMPATHY You 've done this ? BARRY Several times . Before Little Will was born , Mrs. Enterprise and I  --  and Arnold  --  used to spend many happy weeks  --  many happy weeks in our shelter .

( Millie exits , with Miss Sympathy looking after her , curiously . ) You should see our library down there ! Four years ' worth of back copies of the Readers Digest . I did n't know how long we 'd be down there so I wanted to get articles of lasting interest . ( He takes the baby carriage from Grace and begins to fuss with the baby , making small gurgling noises . ) GRACE ( Proudly . ) It 's the only shelter in the country to be written up in Good Housekeeping . p. 5 MISS SYMPATHY Little Will is how old ? GRACE ( Proudly . ) He 'll be  --  BARRY ( Jealously . ) He 'll be two in September .

I 'll tell the world this is the biggest , baddest , toughest little fellow who ever lived ! MISS SYMPATHY ( Peering into the carriage . ) My , he 's a large baby . BARRY Arnold was half his size at that age . Arnold could n't crawl until he was almost two . Little Will 's been crawling for four months now . Four months . MISS SYMPATHY And Arnold ? BARRY ( Nervously . ) Was n't Millie supposed to bring us some drinks ? GRACE Well , that 's why we asked you to come , Miss Sympathy . BARRY ( Embarrassed . ) Yes . Arnold is crawling again too . For four months . GRACE ( Sadly . ) Regressed. p. 6 MISS SYMPATHY ( Taking out a pad and making notes . ) That sometimes happens when the first child feels over-competitive with the second child .

I know there 's nothing seriously wrong with Arnold . He 's always been a good boy . Done everything we told him . Never talked back . Always well-mannered . Never been a show-off . MISS SYMPATHY ( Taking notes . ) He 's never had any previously crawling history ? GRACE I 'm afraid he took the news of Little Will 's birth rather hard . I imagine when one has been raised as an only child and has lived happily all one 's years in one 's parents ' home , it 's hard to welcome a little stranger . p. 7 BARRY ( Buries his head in the blankets , muffling his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man ?

Miss Sympathy is obviously perturbed . ) MISS SYMPATHY ( Whispers to Millie as she is served her drink . ) I strongly sympathize with the aspirations of your people .

GRACE ( To Arnold . ) Did you have to  --  ARNOLD ( To himself . ) When I began drinking martinis ten years ago I ordered them with an olive . I did n't know any better , I guess . They always came back with a lemon peel . ( To Miss Sympathy . ) There was something so garbagey about a lemon peel lying at the bottom of my martini . BARRY ( Angry . ) Arnold ! I 'm sorry , Miss Sympathy . MISS SYMPATHY ( Waving Barry off . ) No . No . I understand . ( To Arnold . ) Please go on . ARNOLD ( Shrugs . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . I got to like it . I got to want lemon peels in my martinis . It still looked garbagey , but I found that exciting ! I 've always been surrounded by lots of money , cut off from life . That lemon peel floating there in its oil slick that way was to me my only contact with The People . It reminded me of East River movies  --  the Dead End Kids . Remember the Dead End Kids ? p. 10 MISS SYMPATHY No , I 'm afraid not  --  ARNOLD ( Suspiciously . ) What do you do ? ( Barry and Grace look distressed . Miss Sympathy warns them off with her eyes . ) MISS SYMPATHY I 'm a social worker . ARNOLD ( Astonished . ) And you do n't remember the Dead End Kids ? MISS SYMPATHY A psychiatric social worker .

( Arnold , perturbed , crawls around the room looking for his coloring book . Grace follows him anxiously . Barry , flushed with embarrassment , rocks the baby carriage almost violently . ) BARRY That 's a good boy , Little Will , that 's a nice , big , good boy Little Will . ARNOLD I found it ! ( He crawls off in a corner with the coloring book . Grace follows him . As he begins coloring , she looks over his shoulder. ) p. 11 BARRY ( Miserably , to Miss Sympathy . ) I 've tried to know that boy . MISS SYMPATHY Communication between the generations is never easy , Mr. Enterprise . BARRY We wrote away to Dear Abby about him . She was snotty . MISS SYMPATHY I 'm not sure you acted wisely . She 's not licensed , you know . BARRY I tried in every way to get close to him , like a father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit more patient  --  BARRY I 've tried , believe me , I 've tried . I introduced him into my way of life  --  my friends  --  I even got him accepted into my athletic club , and they do n't usually take Jews . MISS SYMPATHY Arnold 's Jewish ? BARRY That week . It 's not worth discussing . The next week he converted to Buddhism . They do n't take Buddhists at my club either . But I got him in . It did n't do any good . All he ever did was go down to the gym and ride one of those vibrating horses for hours . He 'd just sit there and ride till closing time . And he 'd have a far-away look in his eyes . It became the scandal of the club . GRACE ( To Arnold . ) The sky is blue , dear . Not red ; blue . p. 12 ARNOLD Picasso colors it red . GRACE Picasso is an artist , dear . Artists can color the sky red because they know it 's blue . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way they really are or people might think we 're stupid . BARRY ( Flushed , strides over to Arnold . ) For Christ 's sake , stop embarrassing us in front of the woman ! Color the goddamn sky blue ! ( He glares over Arnold 's shoulder . Grace flutters nervously over to Miss Sympathy . ) GRACE Another drink perhaps , Miss Sympathy ? MISS SYMPATHY I 'm fine , thank you . You must n't allow yourself to get too depressed , Mrs. Enterprise . GRACE ( Hopefully . ) I manage to keep myself busy . Organizational work . I 'm the block captain of the " Let 's Be A Friend to Our Children Society . " It 's made up of mothers who 've had somber histories with their children and are trying to profit others with their experience . MISS SYMPATHY That sounds very ambitious . GRACE And I 'm chairman of the gratification committee of the Husband 's Fulfillment League . We prepare and distribute many useful pamphlets based on lessons learned from many somber experiences with fulfillment . And , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SYMPATHY It all sounds very ambitious . GRACE But primarily my life has been my husband 's . When he 's happy I try to be happy . When he 's unhappy I try to be unhappy . When he wants me I try to want him . The key to a successful marriage is giving . I 've given . Everything . ( Millie enters and serves Arnold his drink . ) ARNOLD That 's it . A lemon peel ! ( He drops coloring book and examines the martini . ) I ca n't tolerate a martini without a lemon peel . ( To Millie . ) Have you been back to the U.N. , Millie ? MILLIE ( Coolly . ) Not since last time . ARNOLD ( To Miss Sympathy . ) Millie was on television at the U.N . We all watched her . MISS SYMPATHY ( Interested . ) Oh , what were you doing there ? ( Grace and Barry writhe uncomfortably . ) MILLIE Rioting . ( She exits . ) BARRY ( Furious . ) I swear we 've got to replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any of the girls you get these days , they 're all the same . One time or another they 've all rioted at the U.N . p. 14 MISS SYMPATHY I , naturally , do n't agree with her means but if we examine her motivation we should be able to understand why she may have felt that such a form of protest was in order . A misguided protest , I admit , but  --  BARRY She wants her own shelter ! MISS SYMPATHY What ? BARRY When I started work on the shelter I was going to build two of them . One for us and one for Millie and any friends she 'd want to invite . Same dimensions , same material , exactly like ours in every way . GRACE Millie resented the idea . BARRY That girl has been with us ten years , hardly a peep out of her in all that time . Before her , the girl we used to take in was Millie 's mother . When Millie 's mother was ill , her grandmother would come in to clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BARRY We never had any trouble before . But when I tell Millie I 'm building her a shelter , same dimensions , same material , exactly like ours in every way  --  she nearly quits ! MISS SYMPATHY I sympathize with her aspirations . She wanted to share your shelter of course . BARRY ( Outraged. ) yes ! p. 15 MISS SYMPATHY You see , while on the surface it would seem that the two shelters are alike in every way , the simple fact that Millie is excluded from one of them can have a devastating psychological effect on her . I have always been opposed to separate but equal fallout shelters . BARRY But now she wants one ! MISS SYMPATHY Oh ? BARRY She comes back from the U.N . and we 're having a practice air-raid drill  --  and you understand we 're all Americans here , we accept the law of the land  --  so we invite Millie into our shelter . And she refuses ! Suddenly she wants her own shelter ! MISS SYMPATHY But why ? For what reason ? GRACE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARNOLD She 's a hypocrite . A real neutralist would n't take shelter at all . BARRY Do you hear that kid ? He 's worse than she is ! MISS SYMPATHY Are you a neutralist , Arnold ? ARNOLD No , the neutralists are too extreme . I 'm neutral . GRACE ( Maneuvering to leave Miss Sympathy alone with Arnold . ) Barry dear , do n't you think we should make a final check of the shelter ? The drill should start any time now . p. 16 BARRY Good thinking . I wonder what the delay is ? The block captain mentioned last week that they were having a little trouble with the siren . ( They exit wheeling the baby carriage . ) MISS SYMPATHY ( There is an awkward silence . She decides to get right to it . ) Do n't you know how to walk ? ARNOLD That 's a funny question . Why do you ask ? MISS SYMPATHY Well , you 're not walking . ARNOLD I 'm not smoking either . Why do n't you ask me if I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) That 's very good . ( Arnold shrugs . ) Do you mind if I crawl with you ? ARNOLD ( Hotly . ) Yes , I do ! MISS SYMPATHY But you do it ! ARNOLD I do it because I believe in it . You do it because you think you 're being therapeutic . You 're not . You 're only being patronizing . I realize that in your field it 's sometimes difficult to tell the difference . MISS SYMPATHY ( With difficulty . ) That 's very good . p. 17 ARNOLD If you really feel the urge to crawl with me  --  really feel it , I mean  --  then you 'll be most welcome . Not any more welcome or unwelcome then you are now , by the way . I am by no means a missionary . Did you see my coloring book ? MISS SYMPATHY When anyone says something you do n't like you retreat into that coloring book . ARNOLD I admit it 's rude . I should n't do it unless I have a coloring book for you too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses ? MISS SYMPATHY Contact lenses . ARNOLD ( Suddenly shy . ) You 'd be prettier with glasses . Or rather J think you 'd be prettier with glasses . I like the way a girl looks with glasses . It makes her face look  --  less undressed . MISS SYMPATHY You think contact lenses make me look naked ? ARNOLD I think the more people have on the better they get along with each other . If everybody in the world wore big hats , thick glasses and dark overcoats they 'd all pass each other by thinking , " What an interesting person must be inside all that . " And they 'd be curious , but they would n't ask questions . Who 'd dare ask questions like " What are you really like ? " to a person in a big hat , thick glasses and a dark overcoat ? The desire to invade privacy rises in direct proportion to the amount of clothing a person takes off . It 's what we call " communication . " Take off the big hat and they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thick glasses and they say , " My , do n't you have haunted eyes ! " Take off the overcoat and they say , " Tell me everything ! " So there you have intimacy , followed by understanding , followed by disillusion , followed by  --  ( Shrugs. ) if only everybody wore more clothing we would n't have wars . p. 18 MISS SYMPATHY You 're saying you 'd like to wear an overcoat with me . Is that it ? ARNOLD I 'd feel better if one of us at least wore a big hat . Do you ever have fantasies ? MISS SYMPATHY Are n't you getting intimate ? ARNOLD You decided to wear the contact lenses . MISS SYMPATHY Everybody has fantasies . ARNOLD What are yours about ? MISS SYMPATHY Being a better social worker . ARNOLD Dear God . MISS SYMPATHY ( Sadly . ) I used to have fantasies about Adlai Stevenson . But that 's all over now . ARNOLD I have fantasies all the time-When I 'm awake , when I 'm asleep , I live with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You cultivate a good fantasy long enough and soon it can seep out into the real world . Do you know how old my parents are ? MISS SYMPATHY I had n't thought of it . Middle fifties ? ARNOLD They 're both over seventy . MISS SYMPATHY And they had a baby ? ARNOLD ( Shrugs , reaches for the coloring book , changes his mind . ) My father does n't look very much older than me , does he ? p. 19 MISS SYMPATHY ( Evasive . ) I do n't know if I noticed . ARNOLD You 're kind . But that 's how it 's been always . They 're both alert , involved , aggressive people . So while I 'm out trying , unsuccessfully , to make it with a girl and I come home , mixed up and angry and feeling like not much of anything , what are they waiting up proudly to tell me ? They 're having a baby . I 'll try to say this in as uninvolved and unneurotic a way as I know how  --  it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeats and , in addition , have the fact thrown in your face that your father at age seventy can still do better than you can . ( There is a long pause . Arnold fishes a ball out from under a chair and tosses it to Miss Sympathy . She one-hands it . ) You catch pretty good . ( She cocks her arm back . Arnold throws out one hand defensively . ) No , do n't throw it . I 'm not ready to compete yet . MISS SYMPATHY These fantasies  --  were any of them about crawling ? ARNOLD In my fantasies , it was everyone else who crawled . For instance , in one of them I had this uncle . Uncle Walter  --  ( A weak siren begins to wail erratically . ) BARRY ( Enters , running with the baby carriage . ) That 's it ! The alert ! Down to the shelter everyone ! p. 20 GRACE ( Enters with a fire extinguisher and shopping bag . ) Oh , it 's so exciting ! It 's so exciting ! ( Barry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuned to this frequency . All other frequencies have left the air . This is Conelrad ! BARRY ( Listening intently . ) I met that fellow down at civil-defense headquarters once . You 'd be surprised . He 's just like you and me . ( Grace is in a sudden , heated conversation with Arnold . ) GRACE But you have to go down ! You went down with us last year ! RADIO VOICE It is the law that everyone on the street take shelter  --  ARNOLD We 're not on the street . We 're on the patio . BARRY ( Exasperated . ) You think the Russians give a damn we 're not on the street ? GRACE It 's the spirit of the law one should follow , dear . BARRY Arnold , I 've had enough of this nonsense ! Downstairs ! That 's a parental order ! ARNOLD ( Hotly . ) I colored the sky blue , did n't I ? Why do n't you ever meet me halfway ? p. 21 BARRY ( Exits wheeling the baby carriage . ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't leave our oldest out on the patio ! BARRY ( Re-enters with the baby carriage . ) He 's the one who 's breaking the law . Let 's go ! ( He exits with the carriage . ) GRACE You 'd better follow me , Miss Sympathy . It 's dark in the basement . MISS SYMPATHY ( Weakly , to Arnold . ) It is the law . ARNOLD I told you I 'm not asking for converts . GRACE For the last time , wo n't you come , Arnold ? It 's not going to be any fun without you . ARNOLD I 'm doing something else , Mother . BARRY ( Re-enters with the baby carriage . ) The hell with him . The law does n't mean a thing to our son . Come on ! ( He exits with the baby carriage . Grace exits . ) MISS SYMPATHY ( To Arnold . ) I , as do you , question the sense of such a drill , but objecting to this law by defying it robs all laws of their meaning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing to obey it , but to be both against it and defy it at the same time seems to me to weaken your position . p. 22 ARNOLD They 're all downstairs . You 'd better go . MISS SYMPATHY ( Starting away . ) You do understand ? ARNOLD ( Dryly . ) I think I hear planes . ( She exits running . Sound of offstage pounding . ) BARRY ( Offstage . ) Goddamit , Millie ! What are you doing in there ? Unlock the door ! ( Sound of pounding . ) GRACE ( Offstage . ) That 's not nice , Millie . Let us into our fallout shelter ! ( Sound of pounding . ) BARRY ( Offstage . ) Millie ! There is such a thing as the laws of trespass ! You 're in my shelter ! ( Sound of pounding . Miss Sympathy enters . ) ARNOLD ( Grinning . ) Millie locked herself in the shelter ? MISS SYMPATHY She says , " Let the white imperialists wipe each other out . " ( Arnold laughs . ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reject the extremes to which she 's gone . ( Brightly . ) But I do understand her motivations . ( Sound of pounding. ) p. 23 BARRY ( Offstage . ) Millie , you 're not playing fair ! ARNOLD You really should n't be up here , you know . MISS SYMPATHY I thought we were having an all clear by default . ARNOLD I doubt it . BARRY ( Offstage . ) All right , Millie . We 'll stay down here anyway ! We 'll use the basement as our shelter ! Down on your stomach , Grace . Where 's Miss Sympathy ? Miss Sympathy ! MISS SYMPATHY ( Yelling . ) Upstairs ! I thought it was over ! BARRY ( Offstage . ) The law 's the law , Miss Sympathy . We ca n't come up till we hear the all clear . Otherwise we 'd be making the Communists happy ! ARNOLD It is the law . MISS SYMPATHY What if I lay on my stomach up here ? It 's so dusty down there . ARNOLD I guess that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the law to you ? ARNOLD Well , I know lying on your stomach is the accepted crisis position . I do n't imagine you 'd be penalized because of location . ( She lies on her stomach . Arnold views her with wry amusement . ) Do n't you know how to stand ? p. 24 MISS SYMPATHY ( Dryly . ) That 's quite witty . You were telling me about your fantasy . ARNOLD Which one ? MISS SYMPATHY Your uncle . ( Checks notes . ) Walter . ARNOLD Well , in a fantasy it 's you who are in control , is n't it ? So you can make things any way you want them . So I wanted an uncle . I guess I was eight or nine at the time . So I made him up . Uncle Walter . Uncle Walter was a mess . His eyes were very bad and he wore big , thick bifocals  --  about this size  --  half the size of his face and he had a beard . Hair all over . I mean it started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went all the way down to his chest hairs . Except I never saw his chest . He was frail and he always wore a scarf . And a big heavy black overcoat . Even inside the house . It used to shed . He used to shed . My mother and father were always embarrassed when he came to visit . And I was too  --  but for them , not for him . I kept hoping Uncle Walter would understand that I was as normal as he was and that it was n't my fault my parents were a little strange . He would never let me near him . He hated children . So I hated children . Anything Uncle Walter did I wanted to do . I tried to get bad eyes . I 'd let them blur out of focus until they 'd tear . I began seeing my parents as Uncle Walter saw them . I do n't mean I began to understand them the way Uncle Walter did . I mean I became Uncle Walter looking at my parents . I became Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how it happened  --  my father talked Uncle Walter into joining his athletic club . I thought it was a big joke  --  that in a week Uncle Walter would have them all wearing overcoats , bifocals and beards  --  ( Mimes sign . ) " The Unhealthy Athletic Club . " But all that happened was that Uncle Walter got healthy . He got rid of his overcoat . He shaved his beard . He took pills for his vitamin deficiency and his eyes became twenty-twenty . He began to smile at me and say , " Howsa boy ! " He talked business with the family . It was my fantasy and he had sold me out ! He died a month later . Never trust a grownup. p. 25 MISS SYMPATHY Will you tell me why you 're crawling ? ( Arnold crawls over to Miss Sympathy . ) ARNOLD I find that in crawling like a child I begin to act like a child again . MISS SYMPATHY Is that why you started ? ARNOLD Possibly . I did a very childlike thing on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing before I crawled . As an adult my values encompassed a rigid good , a rigid evil and a mushy everything in between . As a child I 've rediscovered one value I had completely forgotten existed . MISS SYMPATHY What 's that ? ARNOLD Being naughty . MISS SYMPATHY You did something naughty on the way home . Is that what you 're telling me ? ARNOLD I do n't think I want to talk about it right now . I want to enjoy it by myself for a little while longer . MISS SYMPATHY ( Exasperated . ) God , you 're as hard to reach as a child ! ( Quickly . ) I understand why , of course . ARNOLD Why ? MISS SYMPATHY First you tell me what you did today that was naughty . p. 26 ARNOLD First you tell me why I 'm as hard to reach as a child . MISS SYMPATHY ( As if to a child . ) First you tell me what you did that was naughty . ARNOLD ( Kidding . ) You first . MISS SYMPATHY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you ! ARNOLD ( Kidding . ) I asked you first . MISS SYMPATHY ( As if to a child . ) Then will you tell me ? ARNOLD ( Trying to withdraw . ) Yes . MISS SYMPATHY ( Very arch . ) Promise ? ARNOLD ( Serious . ) Yes . MISS SYMPATHY ( Very arch . ) Cross your heart and hope to die ? ARNOLD ( Stares at her , unbelieving . ) I can understand why you have trouble reaching children . BARRY ( Offstage . ) Hey , up there . Have you heard the all clear sound yet ? MISS SYMPATHY ( Yelling angrily . ) No , it has n't , Mr. Enterprise ! p. 27 BARRY ( Offstage . ) Funny . It should have sounded by now . GRACE ( Offstage . ) I 'm getting a chill lying on my stomach this way . BARRY ( Offstage . ) It 's the proper position , Grace . GRACE ( Offstage . ) Ca n't we go up soon , Barry ? BARRY ( Offstage . ) When the all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . Is that Millie yelling something ? GRACE ( Offstage . ) Yell louder , Millie , We ca n't hear you  --  ( Pause. ) she wants to know if the all clear sounded yet . BARRY ( Offstage . ) Tell her to go to hell . ARNOLD ( After a long study of Miss Sympathy . ) Do you really want me to get up ? MISS SYMPATHY ( Petulantly . ) It 's not what I want . It 's what 's best for yourself . ARNOLD You mean if I got up I 'd be doing it for myself . MISS SYMPATHY ( Petulantly . ) Not for me . Not for your mother . Not for your father . Strictly for yourself . p. 28 ARNOLD That 's too bad . I do n't care much about getting up for myself . I would have liked to have done it for you though . MISS SYMPATHY ( With sudden warmth . ) I would be very pleased . ARNOLD If I got up right now ? MISS SYMPATHY ( Warmly . ) Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SYMPATHY ( Jackles him . ) No ! ARNOLD But you said  --  MISS SYMPATHY Not now . Later ! ( Whispers . ) It 's against the law ! ARNOLD ( Shrugs . Returns to his crawling position . ) Did you see my coloring book ? MISS SYMPATHY ( Furious . ) You 're not being honest ! You blame me for accepting the rules of society . Well , without those rules we 'd have anarchy . Every mature person has to operate within the warp and woof of society . You want to operate outside that warp and woof , to return to a child 's world  --  to start all over again ! ARNOLD ( Appreciatively . ) Yeah ! ( From his pocket he plucks a lollipop. ) p. 29 MISS SYMPATHY ( Impatiently . ) Well , you ca n't start all over again . It will all come out the same way ! ARNOLD ( Sucking the lollipop . ) Then I 'll start all over again again . MISS SYMPATHY But it will all come out the same way again ! ARNOLD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . It 's my game . ( He takes a long , loud suck on the lollipop . ) BARRY ( Offstage . ) Was n't that the all clear ? MISS SYMPATHY I 'm afraid not , Mr. Enterprise . GRACE ( Offstage . ) I 'm catching cold . BARRY ( Offstage . ) Let me put my jacket under you . GRACE ( Offstage . ) I 'm tired of this . BARRY ( Offstage . ) But it 's only a few minutes . We 've spent over two weeks in our shelter . GRACE ( Offstage . ) But we had television . BARRY ( Offstage . ) The law is there for the citizens to obey . If we are irresponsible how can we attack others for being irresponsible ? p. 30 MISS SYMPATHY ( Coldly , to Arnold . ) You have a very irresponsible attitude . ARNOLD Naughty is the word I prefer . MISS SYMPATHY You were going to tell me something . ARNOLD I forgot . MISS SYMPATHY What you did on the way home from work  --  ( With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me attractive , Miss Sympathy ? MISS SYMPATHY ( A long pause . She begins to sniffle . ) Yes , I do . ARNOLD ( Surprised . ) You can say it just like that ? MISS SYMPATHY ( Barely restraining tears . ) Because I do . I know I do . You 're the kind of person I find attractive always . From previous examples I know you fall into my spectrum of attractiveness .
