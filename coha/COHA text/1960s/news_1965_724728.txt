txt Washington The United States has no plans to suspend the bombing of North Vietnam in the interests of encouraging peace talks . This despite outspoken entry into the Vietnam debate of Sen. J. W. Fulbright ( D ) advocating a pause in bombing to test Communist intentions . In a press interview over the weekend the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee , said he does not relish differing with the Secretary of State Dean Rusk . Bombings may cause the North Vietnamese to " dig in " and the Russians to decline to talk so long as the bombings continue , he said . If a cease-fire on both sides ca n't be obtained , " there might be some value in stopping the bombings temporarily , " Senator Fulbright said . " I do n't know if it would work , but it seems to me to be worth trying . " Washington 's decision to continue the bombings , and the reasons why , have been made clear in a series of statements by the three highest United States policy-makers . Amid criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students , the administration leveled the vocal one-two-three punch . ? The necessities of war compel carefully limited bombings of North Vietnamese military targets , President Johnson told reporters in a pre-Easter message at his Texas ranch . Enemy infiltration , terror , and " death in the night , " continue , he said . " And we must also continue . " ? " If we thought such action suspending for a period the raids on North Vietnam would advance the cause of an honorablepeace , we would order it immediately , " Secretary of State Dean Rusk declared in Washington . " But now our best judgment tells us it would only encourage the aggressor and dishearten our friends who bear the brunt of battle . " ? " We have no indication that a cessation of the bombing would move the North Vietnamese to discussions leading to a termination of their aggression , " Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara said in a Pentagon statement . Mr. Johnson made his strongest statement to date of United States intentions to stay in South Vietnam . Until the independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human power capable of forcing us from Vietnam , " he said . " We will remain as long as necessary , with the might required , whatever the risk and whatever the cost . " The administration views do not indicate // *U . S. rejects bombing pause // any new policy . They do , however , reinforce Mr. Johnson 's Baltimore speech on April 7 . On that occasion he expressed his willingness to take part in " unconditional discussions " for peace , yet stated that air attacks " are a necessary part of the surest road to peace . " He also said , " We will not be defeated ... we will not withdraw , either openly or under the cloak of a meaningless agreement . " A suggestion that a " breather " be taken in the steadily mounting United States retaliatory attacks on North Vietnam was made April 2 in Philadelphia by Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson . A pause " at the right time " might provide Hanoi with an opportunity to inject flexibility into its policy , Mr. Pearson said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign Minister Ali Bhutto , and several other foreign leaders also have suggested such a pause . Long-time critic of United States policy in Vietnam , Sen. Ernest Gruening ( D ) of Alaska , called for an immediate end of United States raids on North Vietnam . Senator Gruening was one of the principal speakers at a rally near Washington Monument , attended by a crowd of 16,000 , mostly college students on Easter vacation . Many of the students took part in a placard-carrying demonstration , in front of the White House . In the Texas message , President Johnson referred to the past week as one of disappointment , " because we tried to open a window to peace , only to be met with tired names and slogans ? and refusal to talk . New aid effort " They want no talk with us ? no talk with a distinguished Briton Patrick Gordon Walker  --  and no talk with the United Nations . They want no talk at all ? so far . But our offer stands . We mean every word of it . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the beginning of a massive new effort to improve the lives of the people of Southeast Asia . . . Already ideas are being transformed into programs and intentions into action . " Additional United States bombings and strafings of North Vietnamese targets were carried out over the weekend . One flight reached to within 60 miles of Hanoi , the deepest penetration north thus far . Meanwhile , special envoys Mr. Gordon Walker of Britain and Henry Cabot Lodge of the United States continued on their separate Southeast Asian diplomatic missions supporting Washington 's position on Vietnam . Mr. Lodge is in New Zealand and Australia this week , Mr. Walker in Laos .
