Except for the neat sign that says " Northrop Institute of Technology , " the pale green buildings look like any factory in bustling ( aerospace ) Inglewood , adjoining Los Angeles . This is fitting , for N.I.T. is the only U.S. campus spawned by an industrial corporation as an in-plant cram school and then successfully converted to a much respected nonprofit college , whose graduates now number 9,000 . <P> N.I.T. was fathered by James L. Mc-Kinley in 1942 to train production engineers for Northrop Aircraft 's wartime assembly lines . By war 's end , the school had proved so successful that Northrop turned it into a subsidiary company with the sole function of educating technicians for the entire aircraft industry . By 1947 , the two-year school was rolling in subsidized G.I. Bill students .

More than 75% are non-Californians , drawn from the 49 other states and 40 foreign countries . Some aim for a two-year technological diploma , but nearly all end up working for a full B.S. degree in engineering . Four-fifths finish in three years , getting along on vacations of four weeks a year . Says McKinley : " We teach these boys what it is to do eight hours of work , to be loyal to an employer and to be dependable . " <P> N.I.T. is proud of its " salvage ' ' work with able youngsters who had given up higher education . Taking a second look , N.I.T. admits and reforms the promising . It rides them hard , and those who respond get immediate jobs in the booming aerospace industry at starting salaries of $600 to $700 a month . Some companies are so avid for N.I.T. 's products that they try to hire entire graduating classes . <P> Zip &; Drive . All this " enlarging of horizons " impressed Caltech 's Dean of Freshmen Foster Strong , when he headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree-granting school in 1958 . The geographical spread of N.I.T. students . Strong discovered , " was even better than Caltech 's . " The dedicated faculty , one examiner recalls , " had zip and drive . " <P> Last week N.I.T. paused Friday night for one of its four-a-year commencements , bidding goodbye to 91 more holders of its hard-won degrees and diplomas , and prepared to open early Monday morning with 350 freshmen . At this rate , the school is fast running out of space , but already it owns a new 126-acre site in the San Fernando Valley . By 1965 , it expects to complete its company-to-campus transformation by moving out to a new plant worth $18 million .
