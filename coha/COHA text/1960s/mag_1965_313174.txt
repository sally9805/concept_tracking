When the Boston Symphony made its triumphant debut in Moscow in 1956 , Russian audiences were shocked to discover what the outside world had long acknowledged-that U.S. orchestras were the world 's finest . Russian cultural circles began buzzing with talk of the " orchestra gap . " One of the most outspoken critics was Kiril Kondrashin , then conductor with the Bolshoi opera , who bluntly declared that Russian orchestras had to shape up . Four years later , when Kondrashin was appointed conductor of the Moscow Philharmonic , he admitted that " the U.S. orchestra is the ideal I am working toward " <P> U.S. audiences last week had an opportunity to hear how successful Kondrashin has been , as the 112-member Moscow Philharmonic launched its first tour of the U.S. with a series of concerts in Manhattan 's Carnegie Hall . Consensus : an uneven but promising orchestra of international rank . The Moscow brass and woodwinds were bright and full-throated , but the strings sounded thin and oddly colorless . Though sometimes lacking in subtlety and balance , the orchestra played with great exuberance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposing Kondrashin , who does not use a baton , in the belief that the face can convey more than the arms , smiled and scowled like a silent-movie hero , occasionally punctuated climaxes with gestures as sudden and menacing as a karate chop . Compared with Russia 's other two major orchestras , both of which have previously toured the U.S. , the Moscow Philharmonic proved itself superior to the heavily romantic Moscow State Orchestra but lacking the versatility and polish of the Leningrad Philharmonic . <P> Founded in 1951 , the Moscow Philharmonic is Russia 's youngest major orchestra . Under the tutelage of Kondrashin , now 51 , the Philharmonic specializes in the early classics , contemporary Soviet composers and what the Russians call modern music : Hindemith , Poulenc , Mahler . As for Schoenberg and his successors , Kondrashin says flatly : " Nyet ! This is not music . This is noise . " He drills his young ( average age : 35 ) musicians four to six hours a day . He admires U.S. orchestras for their happy blend of " German discipline and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyal Communist , he has decried their artistic and financial dependency on " the voluntary sacrifices of millionaires , " whose only concern is their own " satisfaction and public advertisement . " Otherwise , he says , Americans are " warmhearted , broadminded and businesslike-just like Russians . "
