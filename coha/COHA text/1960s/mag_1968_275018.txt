WHAT ever happened to America the Beautiful ? While quite a bit of it is still visible , the recurring question reflects rising and spreading frustration over the nation 's increasingly dirty air , filthy streets and malodorous rivers-the relentless degradations of a once virgin continent . This man-made pollution is bad enough in itself , but it reflects something even worse : a dangerous illusion that technological man can build bigger and bigger industrial societies with little regard for the iron laws of nature . <P> The problem is much bigger than the U.S. The whole industrialized world is getting polluted , and emerging nations are unlikely to slow their own development in the interest of clearer air and cleaner water . The fantastic effluence of affluence is overwhelming natural decay-the vital process that balances life in the natural world . All living things produce toxic wastes , including their own corpses . But whereas nature efficiently decays-and thus reuses-the wastes of other creatures , man alone produces huge quantities of synthetic materials that almost totally resist natural decay . And more and more such waste is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of himself . <P> Man has tended to ignore the fact that he is utterly dependent on the biosphere : a vast web of interacting processes and organisms that form the rhythmic cycles and food chains in which one part of the living environment feeds on another . The biosphere is no immutable feature of the earth . Roughly 400 million years ago , terrestrial life consisted of some primitive organisms that consumed oxygen as fast as green plants manufactured it . Only by some primeval accident were the greedy organisms buried in sedimentary rock ( as the source of crude oil , for example ) , thus permitting the atmosphere to become enriched to a life-sustaining mix of 20% oxygen , plus nitrogen , argon , carbon dioxide and water vapor . With miraculous precision , the mix was then maintained by plants , animals and bacteria , which used and returned the gases at equal rates . About 70% of the earth 's oxygen is thus produced by ocean phytoplankton : passively floating plants . All this modulated temperatures , curbed floods and nurtured man a mere 1,000,000 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so harsh and powerful that he deeply respected and even worshiped it . He did the environment very little damage . But technological man , master of the atom and soon the moon , is so aware of his strength that he is unaware of his weakness-the fact that his pressure on nature may provoke revenge . Although sensational cries of impending doom have overstated the case , modern man has reached the stage where he must recognize that real dangers exist . Indeed , many scholars of the biosphere are now seriously concerned that human pollution may trigger some ecological disaster . <P> <P> Consuming Nothing
