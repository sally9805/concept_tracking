It was written and faultlessly photographed by Pierre-Dominique Gaisseau , the French explorer who led a 1959 expedition to the head-hunting wilderness of Dutch New Guinea and returned with the remarkable documentary , The Sky Above-The Mud Below . His new film attempts to explore New York City in much the same way . " Never has there been a city in the world like this , " glows Gaisseau , as his camera ogles the sheer canyons of lower Manhattan . " It occurs to me that people who expect a bomb to fall do n't build their walls of glass . A city of glass is like a declaration of peace .

Paradoxically , while poking through the city 's sociological byways , Gaisseau misses the singular flavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourists , he makes a superficial tour of the melting pot but overlooks the fire that keeps it going-the fast , fierce , savvy modernity of a great metropolis .
