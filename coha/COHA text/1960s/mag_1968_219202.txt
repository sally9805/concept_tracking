As if on cue , all three Democratic candidates last week took off the gloves and began punching barefisted . Eugene McCarthy , for the first time , directly charged Robert Kennedy with a major role in the initial decision to commit U.S. military power to Southeast Asia , declaring that Camelot II might lead to " further involvements like Viet Nam . " <P> Kennedy tried unsuccessfully to goad Hubert Humphrey into fighting directly in embattled Oregon and California , and the Vice President accused " some men " - meaning Kennedy-of " exploiting " the nation 's problems to advance their own cause . " I do believe , " Humphrey said , " there is such a thing as too much ambition . " <P> The new , combative dialogue was not hard to explain . With the Oregon primary this week and the California primary June 4 , the Democratic contest was nearing a possible shakedown . In the past , McCarthy has genially admitted that he and Kennedy are not far apart on basic issues , but last week he associated the New Yorker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . " Those policies were not merely the product of specific misjudgments , " he said . " Rather , they grew from a systematic misconception of America and its role in the world . I am not convinced that Senator Kennedy has entirely renounced that misconception . " <P> Hippies of the Press . Piqued by Kennedy 's persistent refusal to debate or even recognize him , McCarthy ironically underlined the point Bobby is seeking to make : that Gene has become a stand-in for Hubert . If he dropped out of the race , McCarthy told a TV interviewer , he would prefer Humphrey to Kennedy . Realizing his error-many of his anti-Administration supporters would leave him if they thought he was merely playing the spoiler 's role to block Kennedy-the Minnesotan later hedged his statement , then took a jab at reporters who refused to accept his backtracking . " The people who are with me who seem to be hippies are really the national press , " he told an audience at Southwestern Oregon Community College in Coos Bay . <P> Kennedy is still given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary . The Don Muchmore Poll predicts 40% of the vote for Kennedy , 25% for McCarthy , and 25% for Attorney General Thomas Lynch , who entered the race for President Johnson and is now assumed to be Humphrey 's surrogate . Bobby fared surprisingly well in one nonelective contest last week , picking up a minimum of 25 of Iowa 's 46 delegate votes ( v. about ten for Humphrey , five for McCarthy ) at the state convention in Des Moines . <P> Pollyanna Adams . Even Hubert Humphrey turned snappish . " You wo n't make this country better , " he said , " by leading from fear , despair and doubt . " If some " spilt-milk politicians , " he added , in a speech prepared for a dairymen 's convention in Kansas City , Mo. , " would spend more time getting on with the job and less cussing out the cows-or crying crocodile tears about everything in general-we would all be better off . " Indeed , if anything nettles Humphrey , it is Kennedy 's implication that his " politics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said a sign at one of his Manhattan appearances , " is a stalking horse for Pollyanna.
