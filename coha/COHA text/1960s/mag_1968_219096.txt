After four widely acclaimed books , a vivid CBS-TV interview and a celebrated meeting with President Johnson , Longshoreman-Philosopher Eric Hoffer , 65 , has become a hot literary property . So the Manhattan-based Ledger Syndicate asked him to do a newspaper column . His first response to Ledger President John W. Higgins was a resounding no , but he finally relented . An impressive 214 newspapers have now signed up for his weekly column called " Reflections . " <P> Four " Reflections " have appeared to date . Like his books , they deal with what book reviewers call " the human condition " and therefore are not required to be topical . While most columnists are content to get a few facts straight , Hoffer likes to sum up whole civilizations with epigrammatic flourish . In this week 's column , he chides U.S. intellectuals . They are " likely to consider any achievement not fathered by words as illegitimate , " he writes . " Hence their disdain of things which have come to pass by chance . To the intellectual , America 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and achieves the momentous in a matter-of-fact way . " <P> Eventually , Hoffer will try his hand at such timely subjects as the coming elections . His political convictions , though , are no secret . " I want to help get Johnson elected , " he says . " I have known Johnsons all my life . The greatness of the country is that it can produce so many . If he fails , I fail . If he succeeds , I succeed . "
