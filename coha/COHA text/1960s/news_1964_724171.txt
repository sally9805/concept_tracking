txt The state administration is. seeking to solve its grimmest financial crisis since Governor Rockefel- , ler took office in 1959 . The crisis arises from the need to find the revenue to dose a gap of at least $400 million between present state income and the minimum spending requirements for the 1965-66 budget , which will be adopted next winter . Without any new programs , the next budget will exceed $3 , billion for the first time , compared with anticipated spending of $2.92 billion this year . The present outlook is for higher income taxes , higher automobile registration fees and probably higher levies on gasoline and cigarette sales . This will be the third time that Governor Rockefeller has had to go to the Legislature ' with a program for higher taxes . And it appears that his next request may exceed even the $275 million tax package he pushed through in 1959 . The Basic Causes Two basic causes account for the present fiscal plight . One is the use of nonrecurring revenue to balance the current budget . The second is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without rate changes , at a pace that can keep up with needs . The largest gap in the next budget will be caused by the $235 million in nonrecurring revenue , which was used to balance this year 's budget . Most of it came from accelerating , business tax collections to pro-1 duce $173 million . The balance of the gap is made up of spending mandated either in existing aid formulas or in laws adopted at the last session of the Legislature . School aid and other mandated education costs rose $70 million this year because of enrollment increases and is expected to require at least that much more next year . College Registration Rising The State University , required $30 million more this year , and registration is increasing at the rate of 10,000 students a year. , The last Legislature provided pay raises for state employes that cost $15 million this year and will require $43 million next year . It also voted to increase per capita aid to localities by $20.8 million next year . Part of the gap between expenditures and revenue will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 5 per cent . It could amount to $46 million this year . However , Governor Rockefeller anticipated a marked expansion of the national econ- , omy as a result of the Federal income tax cut and estimated ' the growth rate at 7 instead of 5 per cent . But present trends indicate the 5 per . cent figure is more nearly correct . The need for new taxes next persons is complicated by political considerations . The Legislature will be up for re-election next year unless the Federal District Court 's recent ruling on reapportionment is upset by an appeal . The court authorized the election this November on existing district lines , but directed that a new Legislature be chosen in ' 1965 on the basis of a reapportionment formula to be enacted by next April 1 . Governor Rockefeller has made the promotion of the economy a major objective . While accelerating the collection of business taxes to put them on a current basis , he has avoided any increase in the corporate franchise tax rate , which is levied at the flat rate of 51/f2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distinct possibility that the Legislature , in an effort to reduce the volume of new taxes needed , will force the Governor to abandon his pay-as-you-go policy under which state guaranty bonds have not been used to balance the budget . The state has unused authorization for $410 million in highway bonds and $12 million in grade - crossing elimination bonds . Forcing Governor 's Hand The Legislature could force the Governor to use part of the bonding power simply by approving appropriations in excess of expected tax income . The Constitution requires the Governor to submit a balanced budget , but there is no similar requirement that the Legislature adopt one . One possible source of new income is the elimination of the $25 and $10 credit allowed , respectively , to married and single income taxpayers . These credits were authorized in 1959 to ease the impact of the tax on persons with low incomes . This would produce $100 million and add 750,000 persons to the tax rolls who now pay no income tax .

Each one cent-a-pack increase in the tax could produce $25.4 million . The gasoline tax , which went from 4 to 6 cents a gallon in 1959 , is expected to yield $253 million this year . Each penny increase would provide $421 million in new revenue .
