 |p491  Nature 's Year in Pleasant Valley MARCH 20th , the day before spring . Tomorrow 's daylight and dark would be of equal duration . The sky was blue and cloudless , the air chilly but not biting . Remnants of untidy snow lay in the woods , and in places the ground was still hard . I pulled the car up near a small white house sitting lonely and high on a hill in western Maryland . My wife Eda unlocked the back door and set about gathering kindling for a fire in the kitchen stove . Less energetic , I filled my lungs deeply once or twice with the clear , tart air , and stood taking in the view . Through a stand of bare sycamores at the bottom of the hill I saw the shine of our creek meandering southward . About six miles away it would join the Potomac not far from Harpers Ferry , West Virginia . A few miles to the northwest , in Maryland , rested heroes of Antietam , where in 1862 Gen. Robert E. Lee 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Civil War 's bloodiest battles . Our anonymous predecessors on this land might have billeted troops of either side ; certainly they would have heard the thunder of artillery . A brick church on a knoll down the valley served as headquarters for the Confederate Army 's Gen. Lafayette McLaws , and later as a field hospital . Peace Reigns in a Rustic Paradise When the action moved south , Pleasant Valley was left as before , a checkerboard of neat farms tilled by sturdy people . So it has remained to this day . We had bought the old farm , with some 50 acres of surrounding woods and rolling fields , a few years earlier . Just a rundown mountain place , the local people said . But to us it was paradise ? undisturbed nature , a beautiful setting , complete privacy . From Washington , D. C. , we could drive to the farm in little more than an hour . Here , weekend after weekend , we could enjoy the procession of seasons : the freshness of spring , the burgeoning of summer , autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( preceding pages ) . In Washington we live on a busy street close to the heart of the city . On our hilltop we enjoy unbelievable solitude . Visitors need a map to find us . We do n't mind that the house has only a wood-burning stove for heat . We 're proud of the preCivil War beams in our barn and the walls THIS PAGE FOLDS OUT of unmortared stone that divide our fields . But the biggest attraction is the opportunity to preside over our own bit of wilderness , to watch the exciting seasonal procession of trees and wild flowers , birds , animals , and insects . For almost two decades I have roamed the world for NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC , photographing and writing about gorillas in the Congo , giant insects of the Amazon jungle , scarlet ibises in Venezuela , flamingos in the Bahamas , strange plants in Malaysia , corals of the Great Barrier Reef .... During these long trips it often occurred to me that there was another kind of natural-science study ? one I could make closer to home ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he has a patch of land . Even a city backyard can be appealing , but my own hilltop , 50 acres of it ? that was irresistible . As it happens , the Pleasant Valley area , near where Maryland , Virginia , and West Virginia come together , abounds in wildlife . In addition to the usual groundhogs , skunks , opossums , and raccoons , there are deer and , so I have been told , an occasional black bear . In the Potomac and Shenandoah , anglers catch smallmouth bass , catfish and carp , and now and then a walleye . I never hunt ( except with a camera ) , and I seldom fish . Here I had chosen to stay within my own fences , studying the creatures that shared my acres with me . Our first task , on taking over , was to post " No Trespassing " signs to discourage 5  |p492  groundhog hunters in spring and summer , squirrel hunters in fall . The groundhogs responded by venturing closer to the house . But the slightest move or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their holes . How were they to know that any such move or click would not , as before , be followed by a hail of lead and a loud noise ? Not that the farmer 's hostility to groundhogs is without good cause . No pasture is immune to their diggings ? deep , gaping holes that can spell a broken leg for a running horse or cow , a damaged wheel for a tractor . I gave Eda a departing shout , and wandered out toward the old red barn . Clear signs of spring were easy to find . Although trees and bushes were still bare , buds were swelling . Fields and meadows were drab , but their damp soils and humus were packed with billions of surgent seeds . During summer and autumn these seeds had been sown by wind , shot from gaping pods , carried by rain or drainage , buried by squirrels , deposited by falling fruits , or dropped by mammals and birds . Some seeds had germinated immediately , but most had lain dormant over the winter . Each seed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root , and spore , stimulated by the warming atmosphere , was undergoing profound chemical and cellular changes . One might have wished for eyes empowered to watch genes duplicating , chromosomes aligning , splitting , and rearranging , each cell of every growing tissue dividing into two , then four , eight , sixteen , thousands , millions ( page 499 ) . But eyes able to resolve microscopic detail might be blind to the beauty of the results . Soon a gentle green would tint the landscape . Photosynthesis occurring in new leaves and grass would convert water and atmospheric gases into basic carbohydrates , setting the scene for flowers and fruits . Birds ant ' . bees and myriad other creatures would emerge from winter hideaways to feed on what sun and chlorophyll were creating . First Tiny Flowers Appear The only conspicuous wild flowers this day before spring , popping up behind the barn in. patches of soft green , were the henbits ( page 495 ) . They were prettier than their name Their multiple rosy flowerets , examined closely , looked like charming faces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fresh grass blades speared up beside them . Dandelions would follow . The reddish tinge to certain trees in the bare-branched woods beyond the yard was .1 sure sign of winter 's losing its hold . The silver maples were flowering a full month ahead of the more showy dogwoods and redbuds . I walked into the woods and drew down an overhanging maple branch . Spaced along the smooth gray bough were blooms as dainty as powder puffs ( above ) . Although the differences in structure were subtle , some , I knew . were male flowers , producing only pollen . Others were what botanists call perfect flowers , producing both pollen and ovules and alone yielding seeds . Whatever their type . maple blooms are here and gone quickly , often unobserved by those whose early springtime awareness is concentrated on the more obvious crocuses and daffodils . Rarely visible at any time , but always present , are organisms of another sort ? bacteria , fungi , protozoa ? hidden by virtue of their smallness in a world of their own . Among the  |p494  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil and humus , in dead trees and fallen logs , in animal droppings and carcasses , wherever organic matter provides nutrients . Less secret are the lichens , among the toughest of living things , and the bark algae . I could see them all around me ? gray-green blotches on tree trunks , rocks , fence posts , where they thrive year round , regardless of the climate . Strolling back to the house , I noticed buds swelling quite normally on a dwarf peach we had planted in the back yard a season before . But several young branches about two feet above the ground had been neatly nipped short . A cottontail rabbit bouncing across the yard provided the clue . During the winter he and other local vegetarians had been forced to look aloft for food . Elevated by the deep snows , they had nibbled every soft branch within reach . Poison Unchanged by Winter 's Grip Later in the day I cleared a residue of last season 's weeds and creepers from under a rose bush near the back porch . Without bothering to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vines that , , when clac ' . in shiny green leaves , had plagued us tht summer before . If it were June , I thought . I certainly would n't be doing this . But a day later itchy red blotches on my wrists proved  |p496  that the noxious oils of Rhus toxicodendron are resistant to time and cold , and deserve more than summertime respect . Three weeks later we were on the hill again . It was Easter Sunday ; the forecast : " high in the 50 's , with scattered clouds .... possible light showers . " We drove through the gate and along the creek in the hollow . The ground on the creek side of the track was marshy , and since our last visit large patches of fresh , shiny , limegreen sprouts had taken over . I stopped the car and asked my teen-age son Paul to get me a sample . He jumped across the stream , knelt , and stabbed his pocket knife into the soil , returning quickly with the sprout held at arm 's length . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , wrinkling his nose . No wonder , for this was skunk cabbage . a member of the arum family and among . spring 's earliest arrivals , usually in swamps and bottomlands . Low on one side of the plant , just above the knife cut , a curiously tapering leaflike spathe of mottled brown and green cupped a cherry-size sphere with scores of tiny yellow-stamened flowers . My wife had wandered off along the stream in search of mayapples . She soon found a great many , poking their waxy bright-green tips up  |p497  through the ground litter ( page 495 ) . Within week each tightly furled shoot would open ke a parasol . By early May it would show a distinctive white flower , which would later drop its petals and develop into a conspicuous rry , or " apple . " The mayapple 's root is poisonous . The ! ant is a North American variety of the Old World mandrake , once esteemed for its , apposed medicinal and magical properties . Along the stream that same day we also found bloodroot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ending in a fragile flower with white petals and delicate yellow stamens ( opposite ) . The name derives from the orange-red sap saturating the rootstock . Green plants always tend toward the light . Paul knew this was for maximum photosynthesis . But strictly in terms of the mechanics involved , he wanted to know how a plant is able to move , inasmuch as it lacks muscles and nerves . His question would be answered during a forthcoming biology course in high Thool . But that was still a year ahead , so I proceeded to fill in , touching on one of the most fascinating discoveries of modern plant physiology , the existence of internal regulators , or hormones , which provide the subtle influences for growth toward light . Light and Gravity Direct Plant Growth Chemicals called auxins are the best known of the regulators . Although present in all tissues of a plant , , auxins are concentrated where cell division is most active ? in buds , root tips , expanding leaf edges , rapidly growing areas . Because they are sensitive to strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - peed or slow tissue growth . Here lies the explanation of phototropism , the growing-toward-light phenomenon . If light falling on a seedling is diffuse , the sprout tends to grow straight up . But if the light is more intense on one side than on the other , auxins in the light-favored tissues are partially inactivated , retarding growth on the sunny side of the plant . The shady side of the stem keeps growing as before , and the plant bends like a bow toward the light . But what about roots , which grow downward ? If a germinating seed is turned upside down , its growing roots will turn 180 degrees , heading invariably earthward . This effect -- geotropism ? seems to be a simple reaction to the forces of gravity . But why do only the roots respond thus and not the plant 's other components ? Special large grains of starchy material on the lower lining of root cells may be a factor ; but precisely how their presence induces downward growth is still a matter of speculation . On the second of May , early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post watching for groundhogs in a field where patches of last year 's thistles , dead and straggly , mixed with fresh bluegrass , wild onion , and dandelions . Suddenly a shower of goldfinches rained in , apparently from nowhere , and landed on the thistle stalks , to peck vainly for seeds . Their yellow and black feathers were somewhat dull and shabby , betraying the .  |p500  rigors of a long migration flight , perhaps from as far away as Florida . But they were the first goldfinches I had seen this spring , and they brought to the awakening world a bright touch of cheery exuberance . After darting briefly amongst the bare thistles , the group was off across the field , flying a bouncy up-and-down course and chirping a glad-to-be-home song . Until July , when a new crop of thistles would provide fresh , nutritious seeds , the finches would manage on primrose and chicory seeds , tender shoots and buds . Nesting in midsummer , they would rear their families , prepare their young for flight , and in October , prodded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eda 's favorite time for walking in the woods , for that 's when she find. - mushrooms , the best you 've ever tasted . Throughout the valley the thickly wooded north slope of our hill is known as prime for spring mushrooms ? both the " blacks " and the " whites . " By blacks our neighbors mean morels ( Morchella ) , and by whites ordinary field mushrooms ( Agaricus ) . To verify the edibility of the mushrooms we find , we always carry a field guide . The importance of absolute certainty can not be overemphasized , since an error could mean severe sickness or death . The morels appear unpredictably , their precise occurrence dictated by rain and temperature . They last only a few days . If the collector is too early , he finds no clues ; if too late , he sees only deteriorating stalks , often nibbled by squirrels or slugs. * The day the finches arrived , Eda had good luck . She found three morels on the forest 's edge , their crinklecapped shafts sprouting up among yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were only a beginning . In half an hour she had collected a dishpan full , all in peak condition . The Zahls dined well that night . Next morning we saw a gray fox loping across the south field , obediently followed by her kit . Suddenly realizing our presence even at long range , they broke into @#  |p503  a run and flashed back into the woods . These were the first foxes we had ever spotted on our hill . If we kept chickens , perhaps we 'd see them more often . Mating in January , the female fox has a litter of four or five about two months later . When there is only one , as in this case , a long hard winter may be assumed to have taken its toll . Weekend after weekend we watched spring swell over the land . Now and then a cool day would slow things , but as the mercury rose into the 70 's and 80 's , the forest green steadily intensified . Tulip and willow trees set the pace , followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oaks , beeches , ashes , sumacs , sycamores , and hickories . Somewhere along the way , dogwoods brought their lacy whiteness to the woods ( page 493 ) , and the redbuds their splashes of soft purple . By mid-May insects droned , and at night moths began to fan around the porch light . By early June the woods were fully leafed , and when the wind blew they made a sound like surf . Summer Brings New Beauty ? and Pests Then , almost imperceptibly , summer was upon us . I recall a visit early in July when the mercury stood in the low 90 's . Thistles , spiderwort , daisies , honeysuckle , jewelweed , chicory , Queen Anne 's lace , mallow , and a host of other flowering weeds crowded our fields and fence rows . The Queen Anne 's lace stood tall and swayed gracefully in the breeze ( pages 510-11 ) ; the spiderwort spread along the ground ; the honeysuckle scrambled over fences and climbed up tree trunks . Now at last the goldfinches found seeds in the thistledown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasps buzzed everywhere . Occasionally we heard the take-off whir of a group of quail and the Gatling-gun sound of woodpeckers at work . Young Paul lolled in a hammock under the grape arbor , reading ; our daughter Eda Kristin sat on the back porch arranging some black-eyed Susans , Maryland 's flower . And in the garden patch behind the house my wife was tying up the vines of her prized ornamental gourds . Suddenly she gave a yell . I hurried to her , carrying my camera and tripod ; as it turned out , a spray gun might have been more fitting . Squash bugs were smothering her vines , wailed Eda , and could n't I do something ? Instead , I set up my camera and focused on the scores of squash bug hatchlings loading the stems and leaves near the ground . Patches  |p505  of tiny brown eggs were glued to the leaves , and here and there a red-legged adult , a hundred times larger than her smallest young , sat perfectly still and watchful . The wingless immatures were in various stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that laying had been staggered ( page 514 ) . Such sap-sucking insects , among the farmer 's cruelest foes , account for enormous crop losses . They do the damage with a hair-thin , juice-sucking hypodermic , which they plunge deep into the soft tissues of growing plants . Corn , grass , weeds , wheat , and oats are common victims , and here were our gourd vines , too , under heavy attack . Our own fault , perhaps ; for fear of harming the bees and butterflies , we had done no spraying , thereby giving aid anti comfort to a host of pests as well . Aphids , also sap-suckers , appeared by the hundreds and thousands on a climbing wild rose we had planted against an old stone chimney . These insects do vast damage to crops by spreading viral and fungal plant diseases . Most animals reproduce by the fusion of germ cells ; not so the summertime aphids . Without mating or even coming close to a male , summer females give birth to strictly female progeny by the process of parthenogenesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food is available , they reproduce their precise kind by the millions ? virgins bearing virgins . Not until autumn do certain of the young mysteriously develop into conventional males and females . But by then so short a time is left that the males do little but mate and die . The females last a little longer , depositing their eggs where next spring 's buds will provide immediate food for a new crop of exclusively female hatchlings . Studies indicate that this sudden , short-lived sexual phase among aphids is induced by biochemical changes in the host plant 's sap as autumn and winter approach . Ants and Their " Cows " Preserved in Amber If aphids possess a redeeming feature , it is their ability to produce a metabolic by-product known as honeydew , a sugary substance eagerly sought by flies , bees , and ants . Some types of ants have gone so far as to domesticate aphids for their honeydew yield . Solicitously they tend their aphid " cows , " even transferring them bodily , when necessary , from plant to plant ? from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aphids embedded side by side in amber solidified millions of years ago , proving this curious relationship to be an ancient one . Fortunately for roses ? if not for ants ? aphids are beset from all si es . Fly larvae consume them in masses ; so do ladybugs , raying mantises , lacewings , chickadees , flycatchers , warblers , and vireos . Fungi also destroy them . In August I decided to photograph wasps . For weeks I had been watching the development of a wasp comb stuck up under the eaves of the smokehouse . I had noticed it first back in May , a cluster of five whitish cells suspended by a single thread attached to the roof beam and attended by a lone wasp ? a queen of the papermaking Polistes . With her sharp jaws she had scraped wood from trees  |p508  and shrubs nearby chewed and salivated it pulp , applying mouthful ter mouthful until the h few compartments of her f ture tenement were comp ) ed . Then , pushing the tip her abdomen through t lower opening of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opalescent e - cushioned with a shiny blob of nectar ? instant nourishment for the future grub . Meanwhile construction continued , cell after cell ad. ing to the original nucleus . Within two weeks I coun ed 15 cells in the cluster . several near the center we covered now with bulgi white caps ( opposite , left ) . each of these the egg h. hatched and the grub , gorging on its built-in nectar su . ply , had sewn itself into silken cocoon and developed into a pupa . Crammed like a mumm in a sarcophagus , an adu wasp took form . The cell ' cap ruptured and the cre. ture slowly freed itself ? no a sting-bearing female wor er who would spend the r of her life helping the qu. build more cells and gath ing food for hatchlings. ter , as summer waned , colony would produce crop of males in time f ? mating . By mid-August the co was the size of a saucer , co prising some 150 cells a a population of about workers . To get the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within about two inches of those 60 stingers . I put on a long-sleeved flannel shirt , canvas gloves , and a beekeeper 's veil . Then I climbed a ladder and went to work . Surprisingly , my extreme closeness did not seem to alarm the colony . All members were fanning their wings rapidly , but this , I knew , was not a gesture of threat but a normal method of ventilation . I focused on the target , then pressed the button to trip the shutter and fire the synchronized flash . Like a flock of birds frightened by a gun shot , 60 wasps exploded into the air . They circled angrily , but ignored me and soon re-settled . This encouraged me to remove my right-hand glove in order to establish more sensitive control of the camera . Uncannily , my subjects sensed my new vulnerability , for on the next flash , five or six zeroed in on my exposed flesh , stingers first . I let out a yelp , lost my balance on the ladder , and saw the ground rapidly approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grateful for no broken bones . But there on the back of my bare right hand were four C distinct punctures . Around them the skin was m blanched and puffy and the pain was severe . havi Some people are more sensitive than others to wasp venom ; I was fortunate , for within ten or fifteen minutes the fire subsided . Fully gloved , I climbed the ladder to try again . Wasps have survived on the planet for at least 75 million years , and I think I know how they 've managed it . If the plants prevailed on our hill during the spring months , July and August belonged to the insects . To be sure , the birds were still there in numbers , and their songs filled the air . Rabbits , squirrels , field mice , frogs , snakes , and turtles held their own ? but mainly this was now the insects ' world , the scene that summoned all their energies into feeding , mating , egg laying , preparing for the long winter famine . Insects Hold Unique Place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain sympathetic familiarity with other animals and even with plants , there is something about insects that seems alien to the habits , ethics , and psychology of our world . While the higher animals are to some degree able to learn from experience , insects are generally less so endowed . Creatures with limited learning capacities must lean more heavily on instinctual behavior patterns ? which insects , in fact , do to a marked degree . This becomes at once the insects ' strength and weakness . Because nothing can stop the 509 mechanism once it has been set going , it is a strength ; because the individual is often helpless to adapt should his environment alter suddenly , it is a weakness . But nature is rarely at a loss ; by means of genetic variation and mutation she is able to produce new species that can meet the requirements of many varying environments . On this earth live more than 700,000 kinds of insects , representing almost every conceivable form , function , and habit .  |p511  Insects have produced some unique variations on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of a nose but with antennae lined with olfactory pits . When they wave their " feelers " they are , in effect , sniffing . Many have eyes that see in virtually all directions ; a few are nearsighted , some are blind. * Some insects , like the locusts , have true ears on the abdomen , or , like the crickets and katydids , on their forelegs . Ants have no ears at all , but they can pick up sound waves by means of sensitive tactile hairs . An insect 's taste is usually acute ? a KODACHROMES ? NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY 511  |p512  condition necessary for discrimination in the selection of food . Insects have no lungs ; they breathe through tiny skin apertures . Blood fluids circulate not through conventional arteries or veins but simply through spaces between the creatures ' vital organs . Insects lack internal heating systems , so their temperature stays the same as their environment . They speed up in hot weather , slow down in cold . One type of cricket is so sensitive that you can calculate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September we noticed pumpkins yellowing in the valley , and heard mowers and harvesters tuning up and going to work . By late October , autumn ? the most splendid season of all ? was splashing her extravagant colors around . With miraculous suddenness sumac leaves turned red . Then other species , joined the prismatic procession ? deep oranges , bright yellows , flaming golds ? until the entire hillside glowed in glorious hues . Finally many leaves turned russet and fluttered down to earth . There was a change in the air ; the sun pie ever the rte leaf pig r viously to tint tl weather structur is attad slight Ui  |p513  burned at noon , but the nights were cooler . Botanists tell us that autumn color is the result of leaf aging . During this process , complex molecular changes occur in every cell of every leaf . First to deteriorate and ' fade are the green chlorophylls . Slightly more stable leaf pigments , the yellows and the reds , previously masked by the denser greens , remain to tint the leaf . But eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down ; a structural weakening occurs where the leaf is attached to the branch and then , with a slight breeze , the leaf falls . For all his knowledge , the botanist can not explain precisely what triggers the cycle . Early frost ? A combination of warm sunny days and chilly nights ? Precipitation or the lack of it ? There are many theories ; none is unanimously accepted . Dry Leaves Swirl in Stark December We came back in early December . A few hardy thistle flowers survived in the fields . Here and there a stalk of goldenrod still glowed . A bumblebee , wings tattered , poked listlessly for nectar . A flock of starlings banked 513  |p515  low in the sky , and a colony of crows squawked in the woods behind the arbor . Wasp combs hanging under the eaves of the house and barn were empty and paper-thin . The forest was almost entirely skeletal , and although leaves still sagged from the yaks , other deciduous trees now stood disrobed on ground scattered with their former garments . A wind whipped our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeping the fallen leaves into heaps and piles . Crackling dry , they swirled and drifted like the snow : hat would follow . Eda and I laid bark mulch around our favorite shrubs , secured the doors and windows , drained the pipes and pump , padlocked the cellar . As we drove clown the lane , bound for the city , we turned up the car heater . But neither cold nor threat of storm would keep us away for long . The snows were late in coming to western Maryland that winter . December was bleak but not white . Christmas came and passed , and still nothing but clear , cold skies . Then one day in Washington we heard the forecast : A cold front pushing down from Canada was about to clash with warm moist air moving up from the Gulf of Mexico . This could mean snowfall along the entire eastern seaboard , including a certain Appalachian hilltop . This was our cue , for we wanted to experience our wilderness in the full fury of winter . Seeking more information , I consulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " when you hear an owl holler , " I read , " you can expect bad weather . . . when a cat comes in to curl , stormy winds are bound to swirl ... a hard winter is when you see many woolly worms in the fall with mostly black instead of brown on their back .... " Well , we had heard no owls holler . We had no cat . We had seen woolly worms a few months back , but I could n't recall whether they were mostly black or brown .  |p516  Balancing the U. S. Weather Bureau against the almanac , we arrived on our hilltop to wait . Even with the wood stove going , the old clapboard farmhouse was too cold , so we moved cots and blankets into what had been a smokehouse , a tight one-room stone building with a deep fireplace . With a supply of dry wood and food , we were ready for anything . Winter here , we knew , could produce icicles a yard long and drifts deep enough to swallow a parked car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the main highway half a mile from the hilltop , and hiked up . By late afternoon of that January day a gentle beginning grew swiftly into a snowfall so dense that within minutes the valley was white . As starless night obliterated even the whiteness , and the cold deepened , we retreated to the fireside warmth of the smokehouse . Crystals softly falling outside continued to pile one upon another . hour after hour . Next morning I had to push hard on the door to force it through a three-foot drift . The snowfall had stopped , the air was cold but still , the sky sullen but no longer threatening as I made my way across the yard , leaving a double track of knee-deep holes . The branches of every tree , the twigs of  |p517  every shrub and bramble were etched in white . Nothing moved except smoke curling from our chimney , and me . But the immobility imposed by deep snow and freezing cold was misleading . I was well aware that nature has a full bag of tricks for outwitting weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled a gravid praying mantis I had found there under a rail late in September. * She had spent the summer months fattening up on flies , aphids , grasshoppers , and butterflies ; had mated ( possibly devouring her consort immediately afterward ) and deposited a froth of white bubbles there under the rail . In this mass she would embed two to three hundred tiny eggs . It would be the terminal act of her life , for at the first sustained freeze she would perish , along with others of her generation ,  |p520  having secured the future of the species ( page 522 ) . Tough enough to resist the teeth of most winter predators and effective as an insulator , the froth would shelter the eggs until springtime , when rising temperatures would set off a series of changes in the tiny embryos . In mid-May a new wave of hungry young mantises would emerge ( page 523 ) . Gently I moved my gloved hand along the fence rail , brushing off the snow . Underneath , where rail met post , I found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harboring life in abeyance . The praying mantis life cycle ? feeding 520 during summer 's abundance , mating , egg laying , death ? is common to a good many tem- perate-zone insects . Katydids , for example . follow this rule , as do gypsy moths , most shorthorn grasshoppers , walking sticks , and aphids . But variations and exceptions are myriad . The eggs of some moths and butterflies ? the Luna , Polyphemus , Promethea . Cecropia , for example ? hatch into summer caterpillars , then duly spin themselves into cocoons for the winter . Some caterpillars feed for a time , then drop to the ground , where they survive the winter unchanged under leaves and in soil pockets . The extraordinary monarch butterfly migrates to southern climes , often thousands of miles away , returning next spring to glue @#  |p521  her eggs to the leaves of fresh milkweed. * Next summer 's damselflies and dragonflies were spending the winter in a pre-adult stage in the bottom muck of our ice-clogged stream . Fireflies , which in June and July had set our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snuggled in the forest duff , like the larvae of many other beetles . Wild honeybees meet winter in their own peculiar way.t With the coming of cold weather , the members of a hive cling together in a sort of living ball . Those near the center shimmy and shake like dancers at a discotheque , wings fluttering , legs churning , antennae quivering . As dancers tire , they make way for substitutes moving in from the outer layers . Metabolic heat released by those  |p522  hundreds of active little bodies warms the entire colony . Wasps , bumblebees , hornets , and their kind have no such ingenious survival method . They die in winter 's cold ? all but the fertilized queens , who manage to survive curled up in hidden crannies . In spring they quicken and sally forth to start new colonies .

Exactly what enables adults of one species and eggs , larvae , or cocoons of another to withstand freezing is unknown , but obviously the phenomenon is not confined to the animal wall of piled field stones ? forbidden territory to any summer visitor not wearing boots . a taboo easily enforced merely by mentioning snakes . Although we had never seen venomous species here , the possibility of a copperhead or a rattlesnake was never to be ruled out . Garter snakes and black snakes are the more obvious denizens of any western Maryland stone pile . Black snakes as long as a broomstick could be seen here almost any warm spring day , slithering toward the field in search of mice , or to the barn for pigeon eggs ( page 508 ) . We do not molest them , and the respect has been mutual .  |p524  Now snow covered the rocks , and there was no need to watch one 's step . Snakes , turtles , frogs , toads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salamanders have no choice ; lacking efficient thermal systems , they must adopt the temperature of the rock clefts and mudholes where , during their winter torpor , they survive on stored energy . But not all life here had been stilled by freeze and snowfall . While my own tracks through the deep white stuff were gross 3. , boot holes , I found some dainty footprints here and there , little impressions almost artistic in design , that barely broke the surface . Drawn from their warm lairs to nibble on soft bark , to search for seeds , or just to stretch and run ? a squirrel , a field mouse , a rabbit had gone before me across the snowpacked hillside . And in the field below the barn I came upon a disarray of grayish feathers , likely the leavings of a hawk 's or an owl 's meal . Indeed , I was surprised to discover how many of the birds had stayed on , somehow managing to f KODACHROMES BY PAUL A. ZAHL U NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY  |p525  to shiver it out .

I poured grain and sunflower seed into a bird feeder , although I suspected that my offering might fall prey to the bolder squirrels . Moving away to watch , I soon became aware of a stir in nearby trees . Bright little eyes , from heaven only knows where , had spotted my handout . Abruptly a flock of at least thirty juncos ? " snow birds " ? swooped down out of the branches and fell upon the food . A scattering of nuthatches and sparrows and a single bluejay joined them . The sky was leaden and , as the day passed , more snow threatened . We emptied the remaining birdseed into the feeder and began our trek down the hill and across white fields . County snowplows had cleared the highway and partially exposed our car . Some vigorous shoveling freed us , and we headed home . The hilltop slumbered . But spring would provide the awakening elixir. 525         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
