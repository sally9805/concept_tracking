BRING LARKS AND HEROES by Thomas Keneally. 247 pages . Viking . $4.95 . <P> Writers need myths to revert to-simple unrelenting tales to retell . Americans use the old West . The Irish use their centuries of uprising against the English . In just the same way , Australians use those savage prison settlements that first seeded the new land with transported convicts in the late 18th century . <P> Thomas Keneally , 32 , is an Australian with a pronounced Irish accent . He has found the mythic frame for his novel in the love , rebellion and death of an Irish soldier in the garrison of a penal colony that might have been Sydney , but was historically Port Jackson , 200 years ago . Young Halloran is a corporal and Roman Catholic who has sworn his conscript 's oath to the English and Protestant King , George III . He was once destined for the priesthood , and has a Latinate and God-bedazzled turn of mind . Now he guards felons , argues theology with one , and loves another , who happens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissary . <P> Until the 20th century came along , few communities of a few thousand men could have lived so foul a life as did the first white men in Sydney . By Keneally 's fictional talent , all is made vivid as fresh blood ; the reader is spared the statistical compilations of realist fiction . Yet , we learn in the course of this cruel narrative that a sentence of death by torture ( 500 lashes of the cat-o ' - ninetails amounted to just that ) could be handed out by a kangaroo court of Marine officers as casually as a parking fine would be imposed today . Scarred , starved and brutalized , the convict sub-world could credibly circulate the malicious scandal that the cattle belonging to the officers ' ruling caste had died of pox contracted through bestial sexual commerce with their owners . <P> Grubs , lizards and roots were sometimes the food . A prostitute 's price was four ounces of salted beef . Sodomy was less costly and more common . <P> The story 's hero is given what might be called Eichmann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebel . Inevitably , there is a convict rebellion ; inevitably , it is suppressed by slaughter , in which Halloran must fire ( though he fires high ) , and he later helps a leader of the rebellion to escape . Inevitably , his girl hangs , and he hangs . It is as economical , as predestined as that . The last paragraph is visible from the first page . <P> Readers wary of the plush language of the " gadzooks , hussy ! " school may be suspicious of the special idiom of Bring Larks . But there is no Errol Flimflam here . Keneally has devised a garbled-Gaelic speech that seems perfectly to fit the character of his protagonist who , like another gifted innocent , Billy Budd , speaks with the tongue of men and angels . In fact the doomed man 's only legacy is verses , hidden in a government ledger and negligently destroyed by a bored governor who could make nothing of them . One poem hopes that out of the cesspool , time will " bring larks and heroes . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australians will the pitch ring true . What Keneally is saying is that out of man 's appalling origins , grace and art will come , through courage . His story is as lovely and as spare as a falcon stooping.
