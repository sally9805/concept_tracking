A BLOCKED FEED IA M the sort of man that likes to do things properly  --  I would never , for example , say the sort of man who likes to do things properly , " because " who " would not be proper grammar . I am the same in the practical as I am in the grammatical : I behave properly myself and expect others to behave properly too . In the matter of motoring , for instance , I look after my car properly ; I drive it properly ; I signal properly . When I go abroad with my car , I do so properly : I get the proper documents and make sure I have the proper spare parts ; I also study the proper languages and plan , many weeks ahead , the proper routes . Nothing so upsets my feeling of what 's proper as to run into another Englishman who has not taken the proper steps and who , by getting into a ridiculous mess , makes us all look like proper fools in Continental eyes . Now , last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , landing at one of their Channel ports . Let me start by saying that these ports are not proper ports at all . Southampton and New York are proper ports , but these French places arc just nondescript little termini where packet boats from England touch and turn around  --  just strips of shabby marine pavement alongside a dirty stretch of what only a fool would call the proper sea . Of course , they have famous old names  --  but what 's the good of that , if there 's nothing behind it ? Land at one of these places and you 'll see what I mean . There 's one hugebrown building with a railway station , a customs , and some cranes . Walk through it and come out on the landward side  --  what d' you see ? Nothing ! The bombs of two wars have swept away all the old houses and winding streets . Stare to the south as far as you can , and all you 'll see is a desert of old foundations and dead grass , stretching empty to an horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town as it is today . At your feet is a roundabout , with a pale-blue sign on it saying TOUTES DIRECTIONS ; and out from it a single wide road runs dead straight to the brown spire two miles off , inviting you to make the fastest-possible getaway . And between you and that spire there 's not a living or domestic thing  --  not a man , not a cow , not a dwelling , not a bistro  --  only the dirty old grass fighting with the old foundations . You do n't notice it so much in summer . The grass grows greener and hides the old stones . The sun shines on the desert and mystifies it . A blue sky rises behind the brown spire . The cars come swinging up from the hold of the packet boat , all bright colors and full of girls in sunny dresses ; off they go round the roundabout and down the long road , headed in routes directions  --  a line of sunny colors bound in a queue for Spain , Switzerland , Italy , Holland  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in December  --  how different ! Only the gray desert , the empty gray road , the gloomy brown spire and the gray sky behind it . There was only one motorist other than myself , and I was pleased to see , as the crane wound up his car , that it was properly looked after  --  a real specimen of proper attention . I saw the driver , very properly dressed , climb in and drive away up the ramp to the roundabout ; and then the crane swung over the hold again for my small saloon . And that was that ! Suddenly , everything stopped . Hook and cradle hung over the hold , swinging a little in the gray air . Something had broken . ' When you yourself have done everything properly , what more maddening than the faults of others ! I chased after half-a-dozen fellows on the clock , but it was no use ; they just made evasive answers and sneaked off into dark holes . The station clock struck  --  and I understood . Not only had the crane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an old traveler like me knows when patience is the only proper answer . He knows that only an idiot would ask Frenchmen to repair a crane during lunch time . I walked up the dirty ramp , the damp climbing up into my ankles . I could n't help cursing the lucky fellow who 'd got away before the crane broke ; in fact , I almost hated him . So , imagine my surprise when he was the first thing I saw on getting to the top . There he was , standing beside his car , carrying a dispatch case and a tidily folded raincoat , and staring out over the desert toward the brown spire . Something wrong ? Damp plugs ? A blocked feed ? Hearing my steps . he turned , looked me up and down and then walked up to me  --  a very neat-looking chap , but a bit prim in the face and rather on the short side . He said to me , in a very clear and correct voice : " Excuse me , Sir ! I am Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town of Villey ? " " Certainly , " I said . " You follow the coast road and turn inland a few miles short of Calais . I think you 'll find that 's right . " I added that last sentence because I knew I was right , and it 's only proper to sound wrong when one is right . " It is exactly right , Sir . " said the valet . He raised the dispatch case slightly and nodding his head at it , added : " Villey is so placed in my instructions . " Nigel Dennis , author of " Cards of Identity " and other novels and plays , spent fifteen years in the and is now back home in England . His dramatic criticism appears regularly in " Encounter " and his new play . " August for the People , " was performed at the recent Edinburgh Festival . This rather amused me , because , from the way the fellow said it , Villey would be fluttering all over the map like a butterfly had not Sir Orleton Hampshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Well , you 'll find the Calais road signposted very soon . Is this your first trip abroad ? " " Yes , Sir . " " Well , do n't worry . Do n't get tense . " He waits a minute to see if I have anything more to say , then gives me a little bow and a polite " Thank you " and walks hack to his master 's car  --  a trim little shootin  --  brake with some expensive pieces of pigskin luggage in it . He is about to get in when he pauses , and I see him staring , eyebrows drawn together . at something on the roundabout . Then he swings round and comes hack to me  --  and being a bit embarrassed , he struts a bit , like a little Crown Prince . " Excuse me troubling you again , Sir , " he says , " and I do n't mean to be tense or worried ? but I 'm going toward Calais . " " Why , so you said . " " I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My good man , " I answer , a little tartly , " who 's asking you to drive anywhere ? " " It 's that sign , Sir " ? and he points a slightly trembling finger at TOUTES DIRECTIONS . " It just does n't tell me anything , It does n't make sense . Why , if it was n't official , I 'd think it was a joke ! " I S E E his point , because the first time 1 saw TOUTES DIRECTIONS , it bothered me , too . In England , when there 's just one road and it 's a case of ONE WAY ONLY  --  why , that 's what we say ; we 'd never dream of putting it all in the plural and saying TO EVERYWHERE . That 's a difference between us and the French : we stick to one point or one fact , while they go all out for some over-all idea ; they 're simply not happy if they 're not inflating small facts into big ideas . What 's more , this valet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He likes to do things properly . Sir Orleton Hampshire has trained him like a sheep dog . He wants a directive saying : TO CALAIS  --  properly . But 1 am still looking for words to explain why there is n't one when the valet says , in a nervous voice : " Sir Orleton is d V cry exact gentleman , Sir . When he says : ' You 'll meet me with the luggage , Fraser , in Villey , at 3:30 ' ? well , Sir , that means sharp ! " " Now , look here , my man , " I say  --  taking this hard tone deliberately , for his sake , " do as I tell you and you 'll be at Villey in bags of time . It ca n't be more than thirty-five miles . " " It is thirty-two and a half , Sir , " says the valet , lifting the dispatch case as before . " It is so in my instructions . " " Very well ! Off you go ! Before you get to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn you off to Calais . " " Oh : very good , Sir , " he says , sounding rather relieved . Then , he glances at TOUTES DIRECTIONS and his worried expression comes back . He shakes his head almost in anger and says : " The chap who thought that up must have been crazy , Sir . Who can drive in all directions ? You 'll take the Calais road , ' Sir Orleton said . It 's here , in my instructions . " " This is the Calais road , Fraser ! It 's all the roads . One direction , all directions  --  it comes to the same thing . See ? " " Very well , Sir ; thank you , " he says  --  hut as he walks slowly back to his car , I can almost hear him repeating to himself : " One direction means the same as all directions  --  like hell it does ! " One hand on the car door , he pauses and looks at his watch , and a tortured look comes over his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far brown spire . He stares intensely at TOUTES DIRECTIONS  --  as if by staring long enough he will find its secret . At last , ashamed but obstinate , he calls to me : " H you do n't mind , Sir , I 'll check up with one of the local chaps " ? and off he hurries into the big brown building . Poor imbecile ! I must say , there 's something very decent about his determination to do the thing properly . And I must confess frankly that all we people who insist on doing things properly get into this sort of mess from time to time . We get our brains so bent on finding the proper way that we ca n't free them in an emergency . We seize upon one thing , so we ca n't grasp other things . Meanwhile , the French are grasping everything and dismissing one thing after another . You can see how the clash is likely to come . Out comes the valet . He 's followed by a porter in a blue blouse , eating bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , " says the valet . His French is like mine  --  quite proper , but a bit stiff . The porter points straight down the long gray road . In an explosion of cheese , he replies cheerily : " Toutes directions ! " The valet sidesteps the cheese bits and re-torts : " Not all directions ! I desire only one . " " Toates directions ! " cries the porter , waving his arms and blowing his cheese to all points of the compass : " Barcelona ! Morocco ! Rome ! CoIcanbey des Deux Eglises ! Tonics ? " " I say . not toutes ! " barks the valet . " I say , Calais alone ! Calais ! " " So there  --  routes , toutes , tattles ! " the porter hoots . " Calais  --  sent , sent , sent ! " hisses the valet . They stare at each other fiercely . At last , the porter gives one of those irremediable French shrugs and stalks back into the building , chewing hard . The valet hesitates  --  and then stalks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scene I dread in a foreign country . I stand there on the gray concrete , a cold wind blowing through the gray air , and reflect on the awfulness of a mental block . Is it terror  --  in this case , of Sir Orleton Hampshire  --  that drops some hard bole object into the brain and jams the machinery ? Is it a determination to do everything absolutely properly , particularly when abroad for the first time ? Is it a sort of homesickness  --  a yearning for signs saying simply STOKE-UNDER-BISHOP 41/2 ? But I have hardly put these questions when , to my astonishment , a rackety noise comes up from the dock  --  and there , swinging over the brown building in a French cradle of old floor boards and winter underwear , is my own spotless little motorcar ! Salvation ! I hurry down the greasy ramp and find the officials , distracted from their lunch , chalking my luggage at top speed . Next minute , I 'm at the wheel  --  no feeling in the world like it : all the instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect joy to the ear . Off I whistle up the ramp . At the top , everything 's just as I left it  --  the open gray desert , the toffee spire , the dead horizon , Sir Orleton 's shining shooting-brakeand TOUTES DIRECTIONS in its cold , French pale blue . But just as I drive into the picture from one side , my countryman , the valet , shoots into it from the other , popping smartly out of the brown building . He is followed by no less than five Frenchmen , crossly brushing off crumbs . Get out fast , if you do n't want to be involved , I tell myself . But my conscience is too proper . It wo n't have it . You damn well stay and help the little perisher , it says ; you know your proper duty . And some duty it 's going to be , 1 can see that . For the valet 's face is as pale and brave as was any Briton 's at Dunkirk . The French spent hundreds of years getting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be just as difficult . The five chaps he 's conscripted are all officials . The senior man is one of those stout French types they always choose to head a bureau , and he 's trying to make the other four shut up , so that he can deal with the valet soberly and rationally . That 's the French all over : there are no mental blocks in their world and no psychological considerations ; a man is either intelligent or an idiot , as they see it . But it 's a long business , shutting up the other four , who are all pointing sharply at the toffee spire and exclaiming , " Tonics , toutcs ! " ? and of course the porter has to come running out , too , and tell everyone that he 's gone through all this already with the valet ; even porters are proud of being rational , in France . Well , there 's silence at last , and the senior man bends to his work . You know what these rational arguers are like : they start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grope forward , handhold by handhold , tintil they 're onto it  --  proper logic , I do n't doubt , but dreary to listen to . Anyway , this logician , looking the valet tightly in the eye , starts off by saving : " Now , monsieur ! You are an intelligent man , are you not ? " The valet has his answer ready . He says unhesitatingly : " I am the man of Sir Orleton Hampshire " ? " Je suis le homtne de Sir Orleton ' Amps-hire . " This singular reply comes as a blow to the logician . He finds it as meaningless as the valet finds TOUTES DIRECTIONS . But like all these logical fellows , he knows that if he stops to argue he may derail his whole precious train of thought and never get it back on the tracks again ; so he just looks the valet even tighter in the eye and says : " Very well ! But in addition to being that  --  whatever that may he  --  you are also a man of intelligence ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign trap , or he thinks that allegiance to Sir Orleton is quite enough ; it were boastful to claim intelligence as well . But at last he says : " Oui , " very sourly . The five Frenchmen cheer this reply , because it is the correct reply ; they do n't care a scrap if it 's true or not  --  a very characteristic weakness of the French . So the logician presses on . ' And you , this intelligent man , are also blessed with normal visibility ? " he asks . " Oui , " says the valet , glancing at his watch . " Excellent ! " cries the logician . " Thus , you are able to see this sign that is placed here ? " He indicates TOUTES DIRECTIONS . " Ie suis , " replies the valet , his voice hardening . " So now , " exclaims the logician , " what words do you , an intelligent man of normal visibility , see written upon that sign ? " The valet sets his teeth . In a tone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I beg you to tell me the way to Calais . " " But , Sir , I am doing so ! " cries the logician tensely . " Only answer me ! What words , what words ? " " Words , nothing ! " the valet cries in a trembling voice . " I want the road ! " " One minute , and we shall reach the road , " cries the logician . " We shall reach it when its turn comes . " " My own words to him ! " the porter shouts triumphantly . " You 'll see the road when the turn comes . I said it five times . " " Oh , hold your tongue ! " snaps the logician . " You are as stupid as he is ' Now , Sir , you , you intelligent man  --  does not this sign here proclaim TOUTES DIRECTIONS ? " " Nonsense ! " cries the valet  --  and suddenly , holding up his watch for all to see , he shouts almost in terror : " I must , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road to Calais ? " It is too much for the other five Frenchmen . With one movement they stab their arms at the brown spire and then turn on the valet like a pack of hounds . " It 's here , it 's there  --  ca n't you see ? " they scream . They stare passionately into his eyes . They take his lapels and pinch them in their finger tips . " All directions are there ! " they insist . " All must be there ! All can only be there ! Toutes ! Toutes ! " Then they all fall silent suddenly , staring to see if their last desperate lollies have penetrated . At which the porter steps in breezily and says : " Why , it 's even the way to Algeria ! " That clinches it ! " Algeria , eh ? " says the valet slowly . His teeth show . He turns on his tormentors with a mad , ugly look . This is my moment . " Now then , Fraser ! " I say , marching up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Remember , my man , this is a foreign country ! " They are all so taken by surprise that nobody says a word . So I plug straight on . " Now , look here , Fraser , " I say , " I 'm sure you 're sick and tired of all this nonsense . Very well ! I 'm going toward Calais , too . I 'll lead and you fall in behind me . " The logician understands . His cold expression tells me that he regards my suggestion as a very vulgar solution to an intellectual problem ; he is a fly-fisher and I am coming forward with a worm . But he 's past caring ; anything that will take this blockhead off his hands will be welcome . " So there you are , " he says to the valet . " No problem any more ! Everyone happy ! " He claps the valet lightly on the back , as if to add : " Do go to hell , my good imbecile , and with all dispatch . " The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then they , too , clap the valet lightly on the back . Poor wretch ! He is all in a sweat . He looks at his watch . He looks , with honor , at TOUTES DIRECTIONS . Then , with an agonizing flash of longing , he stares over the desert to the brown spire  --  like a man staring across the empty hopelessness of his own mind to a distant promise of salvation . He needs just one more nudge to move hitn  --  but it must be the proper nudge . Say something wrong , and he 'll freeze up worse than ever . I glance at my watch . I say cheerfully : " Villey at 3:30 ? Why , we 'll just make it nicely ! " And with a smile , I walk off to my car . I can feel the tension behind my back . But nobody speaks . Then , I hear a long-drawn breath of relief  --  and the door of the shooting-brake opening and closing . I get one glimpse of the valet 's face behind the wheel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atrocious crime , a sheep ( log about to betray his master . I move forward . " Bon voyage ! " cries the logician . " Bon voyage ! " cry the other five Frenchmen . Why , damn my eyes ; they 're getting the giggles ! Even the logician , the head of a ' bureau , is having to hold his stomach , The shame of it makes me blush dark red . The valet , however , is chalk white . What a pair of proper donkeys we must look ! I turn into the roundabout , saving to myself : " Steady , now ! Do it properly ! " I move slowly , watching the valet in my driving mirror . But the closer we get to TOUTES DIRECTIONS , the slower he moves . It 's getting him again ! Another second , and he 'll be back in the old block . Come on , I tell myself ! Shock tactics ! And down goes my foot on the accelerator . It works ! Unblocked by sheer astonishment , the valet puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that roundabout like two terriers . Behind , the noise is unspeakable-.howls of laughter mixed up with what sounds like warning cries . Never mind ! I 've pulled it off ! We 're away now , and running full tilt down that long road TO EVERYWHERE . The desert flies past on either side . The brown spire gets bigger and bigger ; it runs forward , looming , to meet us . I feel proud of myself and begin to whistle . Next minute , up pops a sign as big as a billiards table , with CALAIS spread all over it . And turning out of it , toward us , a lorry as big as a house . I catch on just in time . Owing to all the excitement , I have forgotten where I am . I am driving on the left-hand side of the road instead of the right . I swing hard over , and brake . The valet , still firmly on the left , whizzes past me like a shell . I hear a nasty crunching noise and feel a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open them again , the lorry and I are both stationary , with one side of his radiator sitting on one side of mine . The shooting-brake , which must have passed neatly between us before the gap closed , is just visible , tearing down the Calais road to its knightly rendezvous . I 'm sure the valet will just make it nicely . The lorry driver is an extremely good fellow ? a happy-go-lucky type . My saloon has been dented rather badly , but his lorry has done the job without so much as a scrape to itself . You must drive properly in France , " he tells me in the most friendly way . " You 're not in England now . " I start explaining how properly I always drive , but he tells me I am suffering from shock . We drive together into the shadow of the brown spire , where there 's a friendly bistro with a useful garage adjoining . After three cognacs , I explain about TOUTES DIRECTIONS . I point earnestly across the gray desert . I wave my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon one point , it can not embrace all points , " I explain . They have no idea what I am talking about . " All this must be a great shock to you , " says the proprietor , pouring me a fourth cognac . " It is , " I answer , " because I am the sort of man that always does things properly . " All I remember after that is everybody 's mouth hanging wide open  --  as if the whole world had burst out laughing .
