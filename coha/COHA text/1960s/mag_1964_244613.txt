" We are rather reluctant about becoming millionaires , " says Peter Randolph , the managing director of Britain 's Wilkinson Sword Ltd . " It is prob ably going to be more worry than it is worth . " Regret it as he may , Randolph will have to grin and bear it . This week Wilkinson stock goes on sale on the London Exchange for the first time - and the value of the shares retained by Randolph and other members of the family-owned company will make them all millionaires overnight . To the owners of 192-year-old Wilkinson , this is only the latest indignity heaped upon them as a result of the firm 's success with the stainless steel razor blade - the edge that has touched off bitter competition in the U.S. and Europe for a new and promising market . <P> Word-of-Mouth . Before introducing the Super Sword , its stainless blade , Wilkinson was a little-known firm that had long been doing a comfortable business in ceremonial swords , bulletproof vests for fearful dictators and statesmen , and fire-detection equipment . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality garden tools , had no desire to excite a battle of blades . But no matter how much it tried to down play its stainless blades and use them only to promote its tools , Wilkinson 's blade sales took off in a flurry of word-of-mouth advertising . They now have 40% of the total British market and a 5% edge in the $184 million U.S. blade market . Super Swords account for 80% of Wilkinson 's pretax profits , which in four years have jumped tenfold to an expected $9.1 million this year . <P> What Wilkinson feared most has happened . Its success first lured such U.S. blademakers as Schick ( Krona Plus ) and American Safety Razor ( Personna and PAL ) into the stainless field . Then came Gillette , with its great bulk , big name and huge marketing facilities . By now reluctantly committed to a fight it did not want , Wilkinson set up additional manufacturing operations in Britain , Germany , Canada and the U.S. Needing new capital to pay for this expansion , it brushed aside more than 1,000 offers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of putting its stock up for sale . Although family interests will still retain a 71% control , the stock offering should yield nearly $15 million . " This share marketing is rather like leaving school , " laments Randolph . " It is inevitable , but you regret it in a way . " <P> New Way to Cut . Gillette is not much happier than Wilkinson about the stainless revolution . The blades have given its competitors a new way to cut into the Boston blademaker 's grip on the U.S. market ; Gillette 's market share has dropped from 72% to 57% , and profits in the first quarter slid 22% to $8.3 million . With a massive advertising onslaught , Gillette is regaining some of its lost ground , but the whole industry is worried about the stainless blades , which are grabbing an ever-widening share of the U.S. market . The companies making them fear that their success may eventually mean a drop in the total dollar sales of blades . After all , the stainless blades give anywhere from two to ten times more shaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaves on a blade will obviously buy fewer than the industry wants to sell .
