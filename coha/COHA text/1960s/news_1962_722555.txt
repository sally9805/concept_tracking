txt Steel clanging against steel can be heard these days where this city 's main street stretches down to the cool waters of Georzian Bay . It 's the sound of construction work on a huge . $7 million Great Lakes hulk carrier at the shipyards of Canadian Shipbuilding &; ginecring , Ltd . People hereabouts do n't mind the noise , since it means steady work for some 1,000 shipyard employes and a healthy economy for the town . But plenty of executives of U.S. companies that build and operate Great Lakes ships mind it , even though they are well out of earshot . The reason is that it symbolizes Canada 's rising role in the movements of bulk materials such as Iron ore , coal , grain and limestone on the Great Lakes . Last year , according to an estimate by the Lake Carriers ' Association in Cleveland , which represents U.S. carriers . Canadian shipping companies accounted for 18.8% of the 154,200 , . 000 tons of bulk materials carried on the lakes . That was up from 17% in 1960 and 15.1% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. shipping . Rise Likely to Continue From all indications , the share is likely to continue rising . The big carrier underway here is one of eight that are being built or have just been completed in . Canada . By contrast , the Lake Carriers ' Association reports that there are no lake carriers currently under construction In the U.S. Already a casualty of the trend is Cleveland 's Pioneer Steamship Co. , which shareholders voted to liquidate on June 15 after 62 years of hauling cargoes on the lakes . In recommending the liquidation , Pioneer President Gene C. Hutchison said he sees nothing but a bleak future for private bulk carriers in the U.S. More and more iron ore used in the U.S. is coming from Canadian and other foreign sources , he said , and it " can be carried on foreign flag vessels at rates which United States flag companies simply can not meet . " He said that potential returns would not justify investment by the company in larger , more efficient ships which could meet the competilion . Another Cleveland-based company , Tomlinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating . Henry J. Lester , vice president , says business is " miserable " and that " things are getting worse , but what are we going to do ? We have the ships so we are trying to hang on . " The American companies got n boost last week when the U.S. Treasury , in its revisions of tax depreciation guidelines , ruled that Great Lakes ships now can be written off for tax purposes in 18 years , compared with 60 years previously . In other words owners may deduct an average of 1/18 a ship 's cost from their income taxes annually compared with an average of 1/60 previously . New Rule May Ilelp Little H. Stuart Harrison , president of Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co .. an iron ore mining and shipping firm in Cleveland , called the revision " a step in the right direction , " but adds , " I 'm afraid this alone will not snap shipbuilding out of the doldrums . " A vice president of Cleveland 's American Shipbuilding Co. , a major Great Lakes builder , has similar doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Canadians still have a wide edge in a tax law that permits them to write off ships in three years . They also have a government shipbuilding subsidy , whereas the U.S. Government subsidizes only the building of ocean ships . The Canadian subsidy , which Prime Minister Diefenbaker pushed through the Ca ? nadian parliament last year , covers 40% of " approved " costs . " Approved " means that the parts and materials must come from Canada and the laborers be Canadian . Shipbuilders normally pass on much or all of the subsidy to the purchaser in quoting bids . The 40% subsidy continues until March 31 , 1963 , when it will drop to 39% . " Canadians alwayi have had an edge on Americans in Great Lakes shipping , largely because of lower operating costs , " says John J. Mahoney. a lawyer and secretary of the Dominion Marine Association in Toronto , which represents private Canadian shipping companies . " The new subsidy program simply widens the gap . " Buyers of ships on which builders do not make use of the subsidy may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writeoff was provided by a 1947 act but has had a recent rebirth because of the belated dis- , covery by non-shipping companies that they can make effective use of R. This has been encouraged by the government . On a $7 million ship . the write-offs permitted are so large that they exceed the earnings of some smaller shipping companies . But in the last two years , two larger companies . Canadian General Electric , Ltd. , and Distillers Corp. - Seagrams , Ltd. , have found that they could make use of the benefit , even though they are not shipping companies . They simply buy new ships , lease them to shipping companies and then sell them , usually to the lessee , after the three-year write-off period . The new buyer gets a sharply reduced price because of the taxes the ship has saved the seller . Of the bulk carriers now under construction , Canadian General Electric Is buying three under this type of arrangement and Distillers Corp . one . One of the Canadian , GE ships is the one being built here at Collingwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship off in three years , exempting $2,333,333 of Its earnings each year from Canadian corporate income taxes , which are at a 5094- rate . Thus , over the three years it can save $3.5 million In taxes , or half the cost of the ship . By comparison , a U.S. builder could only deduct an average of $390,000 over the 18-year period . After three years , according to C. E. Hipp , vice president of finance of Canadian GE , the ship will be sold , probably to the leasing company . He declines to say what the ship will he sold for but adds , " You can be sure we will not sell it for less than cost . " Cost In this case means at least $3.5 million if the plan works as it Is supposed to . Canadian GE enjoys an added benefit since it is providing some $1 million in propulsion and electrical equipment for the ship . The other two GE ships will be leased to Papachristirlis Co. , Ltd. , of Montreal , or its subsidiaries . One is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the other by Saint John Shipbuilding &; Dry Dock Co. , Saint John , New Brunswick . Canadian GE already has two $2 million " package " freighters on the lakes , giving it a total investment of $25 million in ships , counting those under construction . " By using the Shipbuilding Assistance Act this way we are generating work for our own shops and for Canadian shipbuilding , " says Mr. Hipp . " We have no Intention of getting into the shipping business . " Distillers Corp . ' s $7 million hulk carrier also is being built by Saint John Shipbuilding for use by Papachristfclis . A Distillers Corp . subsidiary , Captain Morgan Rum Distillers , Ltd. , is the direct owner . There is one hitch to the fast write-off provision . If the owners do not put proceeds from the sale of ships into another ship within seven years , the full amount can be taxed as Income . Canada has no capital gains tax but in certain circumstances capital gains are treated as income and taxed at the incometax rate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its sale price Is taxable . But this requirement has not been a serious deterrent . A study by the Lakes Carriers ' Association shows that from 1945 through 1961 the Canadian lakes fleet expanded 80% in numbers and 194% in carrying capacity . During the same period , it reports , the U.S. fleet declined 20% numerically , although its carrying capacity was increased 6.4% by larger ships . With the new subsidy , the association estimates that Canadian ships can be built for from $165 to $188 a ton , depending on the amount of Canadian materials used . Vessels built recently in the U.S. have cost about $340 a ton . In addition to the original cost of ships , U.S. operators have greater operating expenses , an important part of which results from higher labor rates . The association esti- ? mates that the total monthly cost of running a 20,000-ton to 25,000-ton Canadian freighter is $53.840 , compared with $77,395 for a similar U.S. ship . While the U.S. excludes Great Lakes vessels from shipbuilding subsidies , on ocean vessels it allows tip to 55% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of U.S. construction against foreign construction . It also provides a subsidy on operating costs . The opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway has changed the economics of Great Lakes hulk operations by permitting carriers to operate all the was ; from the western end of Lake Superior to Labrador with large ships . These ships are 730 feet long and 75 feet wide , the maximum size that can pass through Seaway locks . They can carry seven times as much as the small ships that formerly operated in the Lake Ontario-St . Lawrence region . Now that more iron ore sources are opening up in eastern Canada , the big new carriers will seek to haul grain eastward from Lake Superior up into the St. Lawrence region and Iron ore on the return trip , a highly at- tractive type of operation . The rising amount of bulk shipping either originating or terminating in Canada also lessens the importance of the U.S. rule that foreign carriers can not operate beween two U.S. ports . Some foresighted American firms have entered this business by setting up Canadian subsidiaries that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mining Co. of Cleveland , through a Canadian subsidiary called Carryore , Ltd. , has part ownership in and operates two Canadian-built grain and ore vessels on a Lake Erie-Labrador run . One was launched in 1959 , the other in 1960 . Hanna . says it has no further shipbuilding plans at the moment . Great Lakes Bulk Shipments Ity n WA LI . STAPIP:T .10111/NA L Slop ' Reporter CLEVELAND  --  Shipments of bulk commodities on the Great Lakes In June were almost a million tons ahead of those for June 1961 , the Lake Carriers ' Association said . Shipments of iron ore , coal and grain in June totaled 18,394,166 net tons , up from 17 , - 499,859 net tons in 1961 , the report said . This brings shipments for the season to July 1 to 44,495,778 net tons , up from 35,357,651 net tons in the 1961 period . " The ore movement rose more than a million tons in June over a year earlier while coal shipments were up 48,585 tons , " Oliver Burnham , vice president and secretary of the association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 287,657 tons from June 1961 , but were still the second highest for the month since 1952 , he said . He noted , however , that only 15% of the grain cargoes we 're carried In U.S. ships .
