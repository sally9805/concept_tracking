The word got out when a gaggle of fashion reporters scissored into Jacqueline Kennedy 's Waldorf-Astoria suite in Manhattan to gab about clothes and to see her try on some new maternity dresses ( $30 to $40 apiece ) . Jackie , they discovered , was upset about a New York Times Sunday Magazine story reporting that many women are disturbed over her " devil-may-care chic . " A housewife , said the Times , sniffed that Jackie " looks too damn snappy . " The Times also went on to lift a story from Women 's Wear Daily , which reported that Jackie spends about $30,000 a year for togs at famous Parisian houses , such as Cardin , Grs , Balenciaga , Chanel , Givenchy . She buys avant-garde models , added Women 's Wear breathlessly , and most of the big designers keep a Jacqueline Kennedy fashion dummy close by for fittings . <P> " They 're beginning to snipe at me about as often as they attack Jack on Catholicism , " said Jackie , who also gets mail criticizing her for her " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadfully unfair . " That $30,000 figure was dreadfully unfair , too , said she . " I never buy more than one suit or coat from Balenciaga and Givenchy . I could n't spend that much unless I wore sable underwear . " Then came what is generally called the woman 's touch . Said Jackie : " I 'm sure I spend less than Mrs. Nixon on clothes . She gets hers at Elizabeth Arden , and nothing there costs less than $200 or $300 . " <P> It turned out that Pat Nixon , who also dresses well , does buy clothes sometimes at high-priced Elizabeth Arden 's , but did n't want to be misunderstood about it . Count Ferdinando Sarmi ( $500 to over $1,000 ) , who designed Pat 's inaugural gown while he was with Elizabeth Arden , explained that " Miss Arden is very Republican , " and that she had sold at least one gown to Pat for cost. * Tracked down at Atlantic City , Pat Nixon , who was wearing a turquoise wool jersey dress ( Lord &; Taylor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from newsmen : " I have no comment on what Mrs. Kennedy wears or says . " Then she commented anyhow : " I do n't criticize other women , and I never have . I buy my clothes off the racks of various stores around Washington and sometimes , in New York . " Pressed further , she provided a distaff version of one of the week 's most popular political lines : " I do n't think clothes are an issue . " <P> <P> * The Vice President of the U.S. , however , is no longer in the lower-income bracket . He gets $35,000 a year salary , up to $10,000 in tax-free expenses and a Cadillac and chauffeur.
