Le Bonheur translates the French word for happiness into an exquisite fable of infidelity , set to music by Mozart , delicately filmed in the impressionist manner of Renoir , and committed to an utterly cynical contemporary view of the gap between male and female sensibility . Writer-Director Agns Varda ( Cleo From 5 to 7 ) suffuses the screen with a rueful , youthful , radiant mood , creates a world of innocence and beauty that looks like an invitation for romping barefoot through fields of wildflowers newly abloom . Only later does she reveal that every blossom holds a thorn . <P> Varda 's hero is a handsome young carpenter named Franois , an easygoing embodiment of the masculine principle , feelingly played by Actor Jean-Claude Drouot , whose real-life wife Claire and their two children portray his family on film . Franois defines happiness as " submitting to the order of nature , " and his life unfolds as a midsummer day 's dream of simple pleasures : work , lovemaking , raising the children , traipsing off to the woods for a family picnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old snapshots or souvenirs collected on a holiday . <P> Never meaning to spoil his idyl , Franois expands it when he meets and swiftly succumbs to a vivacious blonde postal clerk ( Marie-France Boyer ) . The girl becomes his mistress , and he is happier than ever . One day , at yet another family picnic , his wife asks why . Franois forthrightly explains : " You , me , the kids , we 're like an apple orchard inside a fence . Then I see another apple outside- . " Though she is not at all sure that she likes those apples , the wife lets Franois make love to her once more while the children sleep . A little while afterward , she slips away and drowns herself . At the film 's end , Francois , now married to his mistress , goes blissfully strolling through the forest with his new wife and his children . <P> Director Varda exempts exempts Franois both from praise and condemnation . She merely accepts his behavior as an inexorable fact of life , and dramatizes it bewitchingly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus to suggest the spontaneous electricity generated by lovers , repeating one action several times to underscore the emotional impact of a scene . The film 's conceptual flaw is in the character of the carpenter , a prefabrication rather obviously nailed onto a thesis . Socially and psychologically in limbo , freely indulging his impulses , Franois may be intended as a natural Everyman but can also seem a bit of a nit , a boy rover in a working-class wonderland . Tested against cold reality , his story rings false ; yet Varda gives it the aura of just-discovered truth , of a vision entirely personal and poetic .
