txt Lyndon Johnson stands acutely alone , now , in the dense official loneliness of the White House . . He is surrounded by people and by a huge government machine . But the intimacy in ' ideas and.operations that he has specially shared with Bill D. Moyers , his closest con-fidant- , and which Mr. Johnson the man seems to crave and yet to repel , is about to be snapped . So , too , is the most effective check on a strong-minded President whom few , in the close circle of White House associates , can readily disagree with and stand up against . Mr. Moyers was able to change the President 's mind or inclination More than anyone else , when he felt it was important to do so . Heavy burdens With Jake Jacobsen also leaving soon , only Marvin W. Watson , of Mr. Johnson 's earlier group of close personal friends , remains on the White House staff . Many unanswerable questions are being asked here , which illustrates the unusual importance attached to the Moyers resignation that takes effect at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinning of the President 's personal associates , suggest that he may not plan to run for the presidency in 1968 ? Does it reflect deep and stubborn differences between the President and these men , either on grounds of personality or more important , of ideas ? Or is this a natural attrition among men who carry almost intolerably heavy burdens for a hard-driving master ? , One reasonably sure conclusion is that Mr. Johnson now will be tested by what he can do with more impersonal , official relationships around him . The question is whether , with their help , he will be able to rise above the politics , bureaucratic maneuver , and detail that afflict the White House operation , and keep steady eye and conscience on the largei. // *Special gap left by Moyers exit // matters of public policy . This was the area where the conscience that impels Mr. Moyers is known to have been particularly helpful . An element of the tragic in the announcement of his leaving is found in the poor state of the President 's relations with the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this field that is generally respected by the press , in preventing a steady deepening of the cold war between President and the corps of reporters assigned to the White House . Complex of differences In a sense , Mr. Moyers failed in his assigned task . A complex of personal and professional differences between Mr. Johnson and the press , partly unavoidable and partly resulting from the impact of the Texan " powerhouse " President on the reporters , caused this impasse to remain insoluble . There is great interest here in how Mr. Moyers will handle his next job as pub-. usher of Newsday , Long Island , N.Y. , tabloid . He often has told his friends in the White House press group that he would greatly like to be a reporter . He has been strongly critical of news media for being inaccurate , too sensational , even irresponsible ati times , in handling the nation 's top political news . He has shown that he respects objective criticism . He has said that he will not write for the moment , doubtless in view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectivity that he will cultivate and produce in his new assignment will be closely watched here . As he said , in announcing his resigntaion , he knew that the President would not expect him to be other than objective even when it comes to criticism  --  and the clear implication was criticism of the White House and the President himself . Governmental philosophy A chief characteristic of men like McGeorge Bundy and Mr. Moyers in the White House was that they were men of great personal strength because they were devoted to the concept of public service . They could talk with the president as others could not , with no concern for keeping their jobs and with the integrity of their convictions as to what was best for the country . Other men in the President 's entourage have these same objectives but not comparable strength in dealing with a man who possesses the overawing power of the presidency . By a stoff photographer Bill D. Moyers More than a spokesman for the administration , he has been President Johnson 's closest confidante . Mr. Moyers is profoundly convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to helping all of its people who need help . He can not have found it easy to see this element in the Johnson program forced , by the demands of Vietnam , back into second place for the next two years . This may have been part of his desire to keep working at full pitch , in another role , for his ideals . George Christian , who will succeed Mr. Moyers as the President 's press secretary , is widely respected by the press as competent , effective , and having the light touch that Mr. Moyers always found invaluable in this difficult in-between role .
