WESTERN EUROPE <P> While the average American consumer is working toward his second and often his third car , most Europeans are still working toward their first . They are working hard : Europe 's overall auto sales rose 7% last year , when record years in Britain and West Germany offset slumps in France and Italy . As the annual run of international auto shows began last week in Frankfurt , Europe 's 1966 model year headed toward further gains . If , as in the U.S. , the new models brought few big surprises , there were striking signs that European automakers are betting heavily on some lessons from Detroit . <P> Triple Lure . Tens of thousands of auto buffs last week thronged Frankfurt 's six cavernous exhibit halls to view the offerings of 69 manufacturers from 15 countries , including those of the big four U.S. auto companies . With scarcely an exception , the foreign firms went all out to adopt the triple lure that U.S. automakers have used successfully for years : more power and luxury features , greater model variety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that come in 155 different versions , all with higher horsepower than before . Notable among them : Opel 's completely restyled fastback Kadett , which borrows some of its lines from the Ford Mustang , and NSU 's Spider , the only car in the world powered by the Wankel engine . Twelve companies in the U.S. , Britain , France , Italy and Japan are now experimenting with the engine ( which was developed in 1954 by Felix Wankel , a German engineer ) . The Wankel replaces conventional pistons and cylinders with a triangular rotor , has only two major moving parts and weighs much less than conventional engines . Other engineering trends showed off : a swing toward a combination of disk and drum brakes even in some of the lower-priced cars , reduction in the number of lubrication points , wider use of double carburetors to provide better fuel mixtures . <P> Bavaria 's Hans Glas , which built its success on the tiny , utilitarian Goggomobil , displayed a flashy new luxury coup that has the sleek , low lines of Italy 's Lancia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Mercedes , the 250 S , which still bears a strong family resemblance but is longer , lower and rounder . Italy was represented by a glittering array of high-priced Ferraris , Maseratis and Alfa Romeos as well as by the nimble , lower-priced Fiats . As always , the Rolls-Royce exhibit drew large crowds . They may have been looking at a dying swan . The rumor in Britain is that at the London auto show next month the company will unveil a new Rolls with a lower , less boxy profile , disk brakes and independent suspension for the rear wheels . <P> Escaping Tariffs . In the number of cars produced-if not in profits , quality or technology-the European auto industry is closing in fast on Detroit ; last year it turned out 7,545,000 cars v. the U.S. 's 7,745,000 . Europe 's automakers hope not only to sell more cars at home but to increase exports , on which they depend heavily for profits . Germany produces more cars than any of its neighbors ( 2,650,000 last year ) , sells more than half of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,870,000 cars .
