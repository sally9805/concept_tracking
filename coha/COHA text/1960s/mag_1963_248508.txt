Indonesia , Malaya and the Philippines are " triplets who became separated at birth , who were placed under the care of different foster parents but who have now come of age and are trying to rediscover their common origin and shape their common destiny . " This description of the three Malay states was offered last year by Philippine President Diosdado Macapagal . In Manila last week , the top ministers of the three nations made plans to bring the triplets together again . The event suggested that , at least for the time being , cantankerous Indonesia is getting to be a more responsible citizen in the Southeast Asia neighborhood . <P> The new grouping would loosely join Indonesia and the Philippines to Tunku Abdul Rahman 's Federation of Malaysia ( Malaya , Singapore , North Borneo , Sarawak and Brunei ) to be established Aug. 31 . The Philippines claim a part of North Borneo as its own but agreed amicably to postpone settlement of the issue . Indonesia 's President Sukarno , who had condemned the Malaysia Federation as an imperialist plot , apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might as well try to join it . <P> Most surprising item in the Manila agreement was a pledge of mutual defense against " subversion in any form or manifestation . " This pledge is aimed not only at Communism but also against the sizable Chinese minorities who dominate the industry and trade of Southeast Asia . Still , any anti-Communist step is remarkable for Indonesia . Having made this political move more favorable to the West , some observers expect that Sukarno will soon make a move to placate Red China . Next step : a July summit conference at Manila between Sukarno , Abdul Rahman and Macapagal to set up a permanent consultative group to be known as Maphilindo.
