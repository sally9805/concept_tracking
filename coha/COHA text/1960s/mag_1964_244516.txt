The U.S. Constitution outlaws coerced confessions . And an accused person has a right to refuse to answer self-incriminating questions . But what if the " question " consists of a forced haircut ? <P> Gaylord Neal , 25 , facing trial for a grocery stickup in Philadelphia , was out on bail there last January when a hooded holdup man collected $181 at the Topside Tavern , fired a shot in the ceiling . In March , a hooded gunman got $109 at Hagerty 's Tavern ; minutes later police collared Neal near by . At his feet were a bag containing $109 and a loaded pistol that police say fired the shot at the Topside Tavern . <P> To build an airtight case , the cops aimed to show that Neal had worn the hoods that were discarded near both holdups . Their method was to match hairs on the hoods with hairs on Neal 's head . Armed with a court order from Common Pleas Judge Edward Griffith , the police were about to clip Neal 's tresses when his lawyer , Milton S. Leidner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court . The Constitution " intends that no man be forced to incriminate himself , " says Leidner . When Judge Griffith overruled him , Leidner made a deal . Borrowing the judge 's scissors , he snipped seven chunks off Neal 's head , locked them in the judge 's safe pending an appeal . <P> Leidner faces obstacles . The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in 1944 that the privilege against self-incrimination applies only to verbal questions , not to compulsory physical or mental examinations . But things are changing fast . In Rochin v. California ( 1952 ) , for example , the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the conviction of an alleged drug addict because the evidence against him was obtained by forced stomach pumping . It is anomalous , wrote Justice Felix Frankfurter , " to hold that to convict a man the police can not extract by force what is in his mind , but can extract what is in his stomach . " <P> Whether or not this holds for a forced haircut is questionable . But as Frankfurter wrote in another opinion : " Due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any formula . "
