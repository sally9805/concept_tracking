An accord arrived at in Stockholm last weekend moved the international monetary system another uneasy step away from disaster . Nine of the top ten financial powers of the non-Communist world reached agreement on the form of a new kind of international money - paper gold - to supplement dollars , pounds and real gold in bank rolling world trade and investment . France refused to go along . <P> Some agreement was crucial as part of the effort to restore confidence in monetary arrangements , lately shaken by the gold crisis and buffeted by wrangles over the future role of gold in global finance . What the pact demonstrated is that most of the West 's leading nations are still able to overcome parochial concerns and organize in the interest of economic stability . <P> Creation of the new monetary asset still must be ratified by countries representing four-fifths of the $20 billion in assets of the 107-nation International Monetary Fund . That process is expected to require about a year . The paper gold will go by the name Special Drawing Rights , or SDRs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will consist entirely of entries on the IMF 's ledgers , in proportion to each nation 's regular IMF contributions , they will become a permanent addition to the monetary reserves of IMF countries . SDRs will be used to settle accounts between nations , which need growing reserves to sustain the growth of world trade . Without SDRs , most governments believe , trade would stagnate because newly mined gold is going into hoarding and industrial use while the U.S. and Britain are striving to limit their outflow of dollars and pounds . <P> On the Cliff . Tensions rose steadily all week as the finance ministers of the ten powers-the U.S. , Britain , Canada , Sweden , Japan , France , West Germany , Italy , Belgium and The Netherlands-prepared for their conference in the turreted Foresta Hotel on a cliff overlooking Stockholm harbor . At a meeting of Common Market ministers in Brussels , France dropped a monkey wrench into the agenda by calling for a complete overhaul of today 's monetary system and a return to the gold standard . The other five Common Mar ket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time to debate the design of a new system when the old one verged on collapse . This was a sharp rebuff for the French , who have hoarded gold and warred against the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency . <P> Arriving at Stockholm airport , Finance Minister Michel Debr stirred more concern by repeating the French demands with embellishments . As the conference opened , club-wielding police broke up a demonstration against the Viet Nam war by 150 young Swedes , some of them carrying signs reading SUPPORT FOR THE DOLLAR IS SUPPORT FOR GENOCIDE and NO CREDITS TO U.S. MURDERERS . Treasury Secretary Henry Fowler , chief U.S. delegate , took a back entrance to avoid the melee . <P> Around a green-covered table in the Foresta , the clash of views was polite , if pointed . Debr , pressing for debate on the monetary system as a whole , came out formally for an increase in the official price of gold . A long silence ensued . Finally , German Economics Minister Karl Schiller registered his disagreement . Italy 's Emilio Colombo sided with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business of the meeting was the SDRs and asked that the group move briskly along in that area . It did .
