There are several things rather remarkable about South African Golfer Sewsunker Sewgolum . One , of course , is his name , which comes from his Indian forebears . The second is his unorthodox , cross-wristed golf grip ( he puts his left hand under his right ) . And the third is the fact that he can even play golf at all in a land where , by law , whites share the game only with whites , and nonwhites with nonwhites . Last week Sewgolum found himself the center of one of the most ludicrous episodes in the history of the sport-but about par for Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd 's apartheid course . <P> It all started in the first round of the South African P.G.A . tournament at Germiston , when both Sewgolum and South Africa 's U.S. Open Champion Gary Player drew heavy galleries of whites and nonwhites . Police tried to chase off the nonwhites but got nowhere . So , as the second round opened the next day , the government hauled out its trusty racial iron and took a hefty swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two agents with Sewgolum to keep the whites at a safe distance , and summarily banned Sewgolum from any further tournaments after the South African P.G.A. , including the Natal Open , which he won last year . If Player was bothered by such unsportsmanlike treatment , he did not show it . " I play golf , " he remarked . " I do n't meddle in politics . " In South Africa , they are apparently one and the same game .
