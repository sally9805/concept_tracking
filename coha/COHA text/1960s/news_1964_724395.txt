Reynolds , a witness in the investigation of Robert G. Baker . But , in testimony before the Senate Rules Committee , Mr. McCloskey said that the overpayment to the Maryland insurance man had been the result , of a " goof " by a member of- his own staff . - Mr. Reynolds testified yesterday that the overpayment had been arranged with Mr. Baker , former secretary to the Senate 's Democratic majority , to conceal contributions to the Democratic campaign fund of 1960 . Mr. McCloskey , who was treasurer of the Democratic National Committee at the time , denied - that the overpayment had had a political purpose . Mr. Baker , appearing before the committee under subpoena , refused today to testify or to make his papers available to the Senators . He refused on constitutional grounds , as he had when first summoned last February . Mr. McCloskey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baker had received the overpayment when McCloskey &; Co. paid him for general liability insurance that he had not handled . He said this pre- mium had also been paid to the rightful recipient . The construct= company , Mr. McCloskey said , became aware . of the error only after the transaction had been publicized in connection with the revived inquiry into Mr. Baker 's business dealings while on the Senate payroll . " We have plans to recoup that $35,000 , that is for sure , " he said . Another witness today was William N , , former chief clerk of the House District of Columbia Committee .

Would Widen Inquiry The insurance man said Mr. Baker had told him that $15,000 of the money was destined for the campaigns of John F. Kennedy for President and Lyndon B. Johnson for Vice President . The session of the strife-torn Rules Committee today was more harmonious than the one yesterday . It became obvious , however that Republican members of the nine-man panel , led by Senator Carl T. Curtis of Nebraska , were intent upon pushing the inquiry beyond the issue of the stadium . Mr. McCloskey , a ruggedly handsome man 72 years old with silver hair , . unlined features , a raspy , incisive , voice and a short patience , was on the witness stand , for two hours .

' out : " I do n't care what Reynolds testified , He has n't told . the truth herd once . " " Now , Mr. McCloskey , " Senator Curtis said , " do you want , the committee --  " " Now , Mr. Acccioskey , your grandmother , " the witness fired back . " That 's It ! ' . ' Met Reynolds Twice He . said that he met Mr. Reynolds for the first time in Mr. Baker 's office in April or May , 1960 .. Mr. McCloskey said he had known Mr. Baker for a number of years . At the meeting , he said , Mr. Baker told him he was associated in the insurance business with Mr. Reynolds and that he would be grateful . if Mr. McCloskey would let them write the insurance in the event the McCloskey company won the stadium contract . The contractor said he had agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one other time , at a breakfast with Mr. Baker at the Mayflower Hotel shortly after the awarding of the stadium contract in June , 1960 . Denies Two Assertions As - to this meeting , Mr. McCloskey emphatically denied two assertions made by Mr. Reynolds  --  that ' former President Harry S. Truman had been present at the breakfast and that Mr. Baker , Mr. Reynolds and Mr. McCloskey had discussed , out of Mr. ' Truman 's hearings , some details for overpaying the bond premium .. " No such conversation ever took place , " the contractor said . Mr. McCloskey said that . he had turned over to his company 's financial vice president , William K. Stewart , the matter of insurance on the stadium project . Subsequently , he said , Mr. Reynolds was accepted as broker of record for only the performance bond part of the insurance package . The general liability and other forms of insurance were placed elsewhere through Hutchinson , Rivinus &; Co. , which normally handles his company 's insurance business . The calculated premium on the performance bond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general liability , $36,000 . Aide Confirms Story When Mr. Reynolds sent an invoice for slightly more than $109,000 , covering both the bond and general liability b coveracre , Mr. McCloskey said , " somebody goofed " and let the bill go through . Mr. Baker brought to the hearing records that had been subpoenaed by the committee , but he declined to turn them over .
