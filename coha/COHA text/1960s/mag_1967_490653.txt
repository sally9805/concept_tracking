THE TALK , OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WE went to a very artistic party the other night , and everyone was talking about the Art of the Television Commercial . It was taken for granted that the better commercials are far more artistic than the programs they interrupt . ( Someone pointed out that they cost a lot more per minute to make , so they should he more artistic . ) A great debate began over the relative merits of the camerawork and script continuity in recent productions by Wells , Rich , Greene , Inc. , the new " hot " advertising agency , and those in recent productions by Doyle Dane Bernhach , Inc. , the old " hot " agency . A short man with a blond heard traced the development of the last five Years of Alka-Seltzer ads through Archaic , Classical , Baroque , Rococo , and Mannerist phases . Everyone chuckled over a spirited retelling of the prize-winning ad that showed a little old lady depositing money at a hank for karate lessons , and someone ( a4J11 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plucks a frankfurter from his cigar pocket and proceeds to barbecue it with his cigarette lighter . An otherwise stolid matron confessed to watching the daytime reruns of old situation comedies in the hope of seeing " early Ajax Cleanser ads . " And there was an impromptu panel discussion of the possibly deleterious effect of last November 's electoral " backlash " on the ethnically oriented Rheingold Beer campaign . We asked one of the more vociferous panelists -- a tall , thin man who was holding a tumbler of Scotch -- -whether he ever drank Rheingold himself ; he paused thoughtfully and then shook his head . A few more questions established the fact that none of the admirers of the Rheingold campaign had ever been tempted to try the product , and when we pursued the matter further , it turned out that no one in the entire group could remember increasing his daily consumption of AlkaSeltzer or Ajax , and no one even knew which brand of hot dog and which brand of bank were responsible for those other brilliant come-ons . The job of the TV commercial , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems that when the TV commercial is at its best certain people in the audience become consumers not of the products advertised but of the advertisements themselves . This is a little-noted side effect of the Media Implosion . Back in the had old days , young men traditionally went into advertising to make piles of money while they dreamed of one day being able to devote themselves to Art for Art 's Sake . Now , at last , it is possible for a young man to do both at the same time . liVe do n't know how the sponsors feel about it , but we know there are people who hope that Wells , Rich , Greene , Doyle , Dane , Bernhach , and company continue to resist what must be almost unbearable pressures on them to sell out . WE have received another letter from the man we know who is constantly outraged over the difficulty of maintaining life in this city . " Do n't talk to me about snow emergencies , " he wrote . " This whole place is an emergency , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apartment for a day or two , and when I heard a radio newscaster say that the commuter trains were hopelessly late and the subways stuffed , I thought the radio news people had finally got around to describing what it 's like here every afternoon . I did n't even know it had snowed . I miss these civic crises all the time ; if your whole house is on fire , it 's easy not to notice that the coffee has boiled over . Last year , what the papers called a ' crippling taxi strike ' came and went without my noticing it I have n't been able to get a taxi when I wanted one for a year and a half , strike or no strike . I have long had the feeling that I could get to work in midtown from my-apartment in Greenwich Village by taking a bus that stops right in front of my door , but I 've never taken it , because I do n't know where it goes . Naturally , there arc no hints at the bus stop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue ' on the front , but it does n't say how it gets dierc . I asked the bus driver a couple of times , but he did n't know , or was too busy shutting the door on elderly ladies to answer . Someday , of course , I 'm going to want to go up to 146th Street and Lenox Avenue , and then it will be very convenient . Do n't get me started on buses . I wrote to talk about this so-called snow emergency . Of the four or five million words written in the Times shout it , one clause caught my eye : ' Even as police cars were taking stars to Broadway theatres ... ' I 'm personally not opposed to special treatment ; a few of us might as well he comfortable around here . I do n't even become alarmed about the doctors and their loved ones parking in midtown  --  although a friend of mine who visited the city for the first time just before Christmas would n't go into Mae ) ' s because he saw so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were having an epidemic . What bothers me is that the police obviously carted these actors around under the heading of public service  --  the show must go on , and all that . As it happens , though , I 've seen some of those shows , and I think the public would be a lot better served if the actors in a few of them I could name were left in their snowdrifts  --  along with the directors , the producers , and whoever it is that decides that two and a half hours of entertainment is worth twelve dollars . It 's just like this town to ask a policeman to make an artistic decision . " AS staggered and lurched and slipped along Seventy-seventh Street , heading for Fifth Avenue , on the morning after the blizzard , OUT attention was caught by a youthful snow-shoveller working in front of a large apartment house . He was whistling " A Hard Day 's Night " as he scraped the sidewalk --  " It 's been a ha rd ( scrap ' ) day 's ( coati ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in high spirits . He wore an Army-surplus field jacket , with a " Pray for Surf " button on the lapel , cowboy hoots , gloves , and no hat . As we passed , he paused in his scraping and whistling , and said , gazing around at the buried automobiles , " Beautiful l ... Beautiful ! " We stopped on a cleared spot , and agreed . " This is the answer , " he said , waving at the scene . " To what ? " we asked . " Everything , " lie replied . " Including the world situation . " " Really ? " we said . He banged the snow off his shovel and nodded . " Snow is the enemy of war , " he said . " You mean like Napoleon at Moscow ? " we asked , " Not exactly . There was n't enough of it . Let me explain a little . Take nuclear weapons . We 've got the equivalent of twenty-five tons of TNT for every man , woman , and child on earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? And , even aside from the cost , the whole idea makes everybody feel guilty and sick , just thinking about it  --  not to mention napalm , white phosphorus , and all that . Now , snow " ? he looked us in the eye ? " is cheap , effective , and beautiful . For about a hundred dollars , the weapons-development guys could come up with a pellet you drop from a plane , and  --  whoos10 ? the enemy is buried under ten feet of snow . What have you got ? A detente . A lull in the fighting . Time to think and consider . One ton of snow per person would he plenty . Beyond that , it would he overkill , nr overfreezc . The enemy retaliates so what ? We 're all in it together . Beautiful white snow . You 're cold but not dead . You try to get warm . That 's constructive . You dig out . You make a snowman , you slide down hills , you throw snowballs . If you slip on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice , you are immediately brothers . You help somebody up , or they help you that 's gratitude , and warmth , and love . Our State Department makes contact with their State Department : ' It 's cold over here . What 's it like over there ? ' ' Cold ' is their reply . Ha ! A dialogue commences . Who knows where it may lead ? Cover Dean Rusk with snow , I say , and when he melts , frozen policies will melt with him . And how about dictators ? They 'll vanish . They ca n't drive around in their big black cars , so they walk , slip on the ice , fall down , and when they get up everybody sees that the dictator 's got snow all over the hack of his fancy uniform . A dictator Can survive a lot of things , hut not snow on the back of his uniform . " The young man smacked his gloves together . " Boundary disputes will disappear , because there will he no boundaries  --  just snow , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conic from ? ' ' I do n't know . It 's near a couple of big evergreens next to a lake at the foot of a mountain . ' Who will remember when- the Berlin Wall stood ? It 'll just be down there someplace , under all that snow . ' We will bury you , ' said Khrushchev . I like to think he meant in snow . Thank you , I say ; we will bury you , ton , and we 'll all be better off . " He paused . " How did those Mexican quadruplets survive last week ? Because all the neighbors came around and huddled together to make the room warm . Who are the nicest people in the woad. ? The ones with the most snow  --  Eskimos . Around the Arctic Circle , it 's all love , and huddling together , and sharing , and snow . " We made a move toward Fifth Avenue , and the young man said , " You do n't believe me , do you Well , I 'll prove my theory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't have stond here listening to me . Hell , no ! You 'd have been marching along down the sidewalk , swinging that briefcase , speaking to no one , nose in the air , alone and aloof , afraid to he friendly , and " ? he clanged his shovel ? " ready for war ! " Blizzard Report " I 'M trying to save your life ! " a red- checked woman shouted as snow whipped and swirled around her . " What 's that about a line ? " shouted her female companion , whose ears were covered by a lavender kerchief . " Your life ! " the first woman shouted , grinning and taking her companion 's arm . Laughing , the two women fought their way across the snow-filled intersection of Sixth Avenue and Forty-fourth Street . We had put on our warmest sweater , overcoat , and cap , and our stoutest boots , and had ventured out of our office shortly after noon on the day of last week 's blizzard , hod to observe the phenomenon and to see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one after another , and in many places traffic was at a standstill . Heavily clad patrolmen , knee-deep in snow , were trying to direct the few cars that were still moving ; stalled vehicles , many of them driverless , stood askew and awry , blocking streets . just west of the Forty-fourth Street intersection , we came upon a red-and-white delivery truck embedded in drifted snow . Its rear wheels were spinning uselessly in deep self-made . ruts , sending up a futile whine . Without warning , one of our arms was grasped from behind , and a small , extremely high voice said , " Which way you going ? Help me . T ca n't see so good . " We turned and saw that a very thin old man with watery eyes and a white , unshaven face was clinging to our arm . " We 're headed west , " we said . " I 'm seventy-two years old , " the incredibly high , frail voice said . " Which way do you want to go ? " we shouted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pointed toward Sixth Avenue . We turned around , with the thin old man still clinging to our arm , and faced into the billowing whiteness , plowing eastward . We had gone about thirty paces when a voice heli:nd us cried " Billy ! " and the old man faltered . " That 's all right , " a younger man said to us , running up from behind . " I know him . I 'm going to the subway ' , Billy . Come on . I 'll take you . " The old man transferred his grip from our arm to the other man 's arm , and , smiling and openmouthed , walked on into the storm . Snow was coming down very hard now ; in places it was feathery , in other places it drove straight across our line of vision . Sidewalk phone booths were topped by austere domes of white , and the windshields of parked cars had become solid panels of crystals . At Times Square , we saw that the moving sign on the Allied Chemical Tower gave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few blocks north gave it as thirteen degrees . We paused for a moment to note the chilly nakedness of Adam and Eve on posters outside Loew 's State . Theatre , where " The Bible " was playing . At Fiftieth Street , we headed east . We began to come upon objects that had been abandoned by their owners and were rapidly vanishing into the snow : a demolished umbrella , a catalogue from the New School , a green chiffon scarf . In the skating rink at Rockefeller Center , four men on hockey skates were trying to clear the ice of drifts with the aid of a small snowplow . When we reached Fifth Avenue , we came upon two girls asking a policeman how to get to Sullivan and Houston Streets . The policeman was saying , " The Number Five will get you there , but it 's gone sick on us . " We turned up Fifth Avenue . In front of Dc Pinna , four men were shovelling snow . One of them called out , " I 'll he glad to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled a co-worker . " I want to see the curb ! " Suddenly , like an apparition out of some Nordic tale , at a rubber-matted approach to the Intro Bank , near Fifty-third Street , a whirlwind of fine snow  --  so fine that it had become a Tinning cloud  --  began to sweep hack and forth in a random pattern over the matting . For as long as we stood watching , the whirlwind-cloud swirled back and forth , restlessly seizing whatever particles lay in its path . The sky whitened , and after a few seconds incongruous thunder rolled behind us . People ahead of us turned and glanced over their shoulders , grimaced , and turned hack to talk to one another . From time to time , cars honked , but for the most part they moved quietly and sluggishly through the drifts . A van from the Automatic Canteen Food &; Vending Service pulled a sister van down Fifth Avenue at the end of a chain . " They say Madison is had ! " someone shouted ahead of us . We crossed Fifty-seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the Plaza , where we found the Pulitzer Memorial Fountain buried in snow , drifts rising from its basins like lunar mountainsides , its statue of Abundance rearing above luxuriant , abundant slopes . Pushing on  --  with the earflaps of our cap pulled down  --  we advanced through deepening drifts into Central Park , where we heard a passerby say , " This morning they were still clearing the paths here . " The effort had obviously been abandoned , for the paths were now totally lost . Most of the outdoor cages at the Zoo were empty ; in one of them , though , two Japanese deer Huddled in the snow , turning their heads querulously . In the Zoo 's pool , now in the . center of a soft , wind-contoured field , four seals rose and dived , skipped and arched through their watery world . INIc plowed on through the snow toward the bear cages . Three of the cages appeared to be empty , but in a fourth cage we saw what at first we took to he two enormous buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polar hears lay sleeping in the snow , their yellowish-white fur glistening under a soft covering of flakes . Their amber bellies rose and fell as they slept . Reluctantly , we left the polar bears and pushed on . The Wollman Memorial Skating Rink was deserted and deep in drifts . lAre made our way circuitously down snow-covered hills . For a moment , we stood still . The city was absolutely silent . Not a car was to be heard , not a voice . The wind had abated somewhat , and fine snow fell gently about our face . A sparrow fluttered across our path . We started walking again . We wandered in a broad circle , and eventually found ourself on a snowy hill above the Fifty-ninth Street pond . Looking down , we saw that the ducks and geese had all gathered in a pool of open water at the pond 's northeast corner  --  the only part of the water that had not yet frozen . We heard quacking , and then two mallards rose From the water and soared swiftly , flapping westward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch above us floated a yellow-and-blue balloon , its string caught on a twig . We walked on , past phantom trees , toward the dim outlines of buildings on the horizon . For a moment , all we could hear was the crunch of our own hoots . Then we reached Fifty-ninth Street and people again . An ecstatic-looking young man , standing with his gloved hands spread wide , cried out to no one in particular , in a Spanish accent , " It 's snowing , man ! Hey , it 's really snowing ! You know ? " ? the morning after the blizzard , ? s-.1 O we emerged from our apartment building to find the cold air filled with the harsh rasp of shovels scraping sidewalks and the shouts of children pulling sleds toward Central Park . Most of the children in our neighborhood were heading for Cedar Hill , which is at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Seventy-ninth Street , and after our encounter with the peace-loving young man , we followed one group of them . When we arrived there , shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparkling in the sunlight and swarming with youngsters on sleds or snow saucers . As we stood at the bottom , watching , two boys took belly-whoppers from the top and , deftly steering their sleds through a maze of other sleds , came racing down the slope . They were followed by a pair of girls on a small toboggan , a gaggle of girls sitting on a train made up of four sleds hitched together , and a teen-ager riding a snow saucer as if it were a surfboard . The girls on the toboggan took a spill when they flew over a snow-covered ledge ; the girls on the sled train ended up in a tangle of arms and legs when the train jackknifed on a steep part of the hill ; and the intrepid young man on the snow saucer came to grief when the saucer buried itself in a snowdrift and he became unexpectedly airborne . Beside us , two small boys were leaning 011 their sleds and surveying the hill with knowing detachment . " The snow 's too deep , " said one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . " " Maybe we 'll get some freezing rain , " his companion replied hopefully . " Remember how it was at Christmas ? " An argument broke out behind us among several other boys , who were discussing the merits of their sleds . " You ca n't beat a Flexible-Flyer , " said one sled owner . " That 's what you think ! " replied another boy , who was towing a Speed-away . " I 'll race anybody here , " announced a third youngster , who had a Silver Streak . This challenge was immediately accepted by the two other boys , and as the three started tip the hill , we followed them to see how things would go . On the way , we paused to watch a snowball fight between a group of boys who were defending a knoll and a group of boys who were attacking it from below . The defenders of the knoll had stuck their sleds in the snowto make a breastwork , and were sending a barrage of soft missiles down upon their adversaries . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uphill charge , which failed . Finally , they carried out a successful encircling maneuver and stormed the position from die rear , whereupon the defenders took to their sleds and fled . When we reached the top of the hill , we had a word with a man who was wearing a wool parka and a circular patch that identified him as a recreation director for the Parks Department . " It 's going to be a busy day , " he told us . " The big problem is to keep the center of the slope clear , so that the kids coming down do n't crash into the kids coming up . When the snow is fresh and deep , it 's easy to keep the little devils under control , but wait till it gets packed down and frozen . That 's when we have accidents . I'Ve 've had some had ones here in recent years , so today or tomorrow we 'll start stacking straw hales around the tree trunks . " When the contestants in the sled race had lined up on the crest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set ! Go ! " and everybody took a running start , did a belly-whopper , and flew down the hill . The race ended , far below , in what appeared to be a dead heat . Then a small boy standing next to us announced that he could beat anyone on the hill . He was pulling an ancient , ungainly-looking sled without varnish or markings , and when we asked him what kind it was , he told us it was a Sherwood Spring coaster . " It used to belong to my grandfather , " he said proudly . " After that , it was my father 's , and now it 's mine . It 's a lot faster than the new , streamlined sleds , because it 's higher off the ground and rides over the drifts better . Do you want to try it and see ? " After a moment 's hesitation , we accepted the invitation and shoved off no the old Sherwood Spring coaster , which took us to the bottom of Cedar Hill in what may not have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared to go . Coincidence ALEARNED friend of ours recently gave a lecture at a New England college in the course of which he referred to present-day students as the Inarticulate Generation . At a reception following the lecture , a girl student elbowed her way toward him . " I really liked what you said about us being inarticulate , " she told him earTHE NEW YORKER nestly . " I 've often felt something like that myself , only I 've never been able to put it into words . " Tire Physicists ACOUPLE of weeks ago , we dropped by the Hotel New Yorker to visit some six hundred and fifty physicists and astronomers assembled there for the Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics , and the other day , our scientific curiosity having been aroused , we looked in on the four-day 1967 Annual Meeting at New York of the American Physical Society , the largest professional association of American physicists , with a membership of about twenty-three thousand , nearly five thousand of whom had gathered at the New York Hilton . The Symposium had been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ en famille , and most of them had been established workers in their field , getting together to share information on a common subject . The Physical Society meeting , we discovered , was a different matter . For one thing , it consisted of the delivering of eight hundred and twenty-three ten-minute talks in auditoriums dispersed throughout the two lower floors of the hotel  --  talks , covering every conceivable branch of physics , on subjects so diverse that any one physicist was able to follow only a few . The atmosphere at the Hilton on the second day , when we paid our call , was chaotic . Every available corner was crammed with physicists , of all ages and descriptions , most of them with identification cards sprouting from their breast pockets . On the first floor was an enormous registration desk , where members of the society , after paying a registration fee of two dollars , were able to pick up name cards and a **28;3216;TOOLONG program of the meeting . A nearby corridor led to a series of rooms where book publishers and distributors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , were crammed with physicists , and also with flashing electronic instruments , tables of impressive-looking new books , and occasional pretty girls , bearing the standards of assorted publishers and distributors . We headed for the next floor , and there we came upon an immense message center , which had tack-up hoards dotted with small folded papers , air-mail letters , and a telegram or two . A preoccupied-looking physicist whose name tag identified him as Professor Kenneth Case , of the University of Michigan , told us , when we ventured to inquire how things were going , that he had come to the meeting with a list of graduate students from various places who were finishing up their degree work and were looking for jobs at Michigan , and that he was trying to track them down in order to interview them . He thereupon disappeared into the crowd , and we fell in with a couple of students  --  not on his list  --  one of whom told us that the job situation is extremely tight in the universities this year . " Places that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , " he said , and added , " It 's the Vietnam war . There just is n't the money for pure science that there used to he . " We asked him what be was planning to do , and he replied that he was looking into industrial jobs and government labs . " I had an interview with a guy from a government lab yesterday , " he said , " and when I told him what my thesis had been on  --  a topic in pure physics  --  he said he did n't know anything about the subject , but he promised that someone else from the lab , who might be able to discuss it with me , would be available today . " We presently stuck our head into the Grand Ballroom , where the Joint Ceremonial Session of the Physical Society and the American Association of Physics Teachers was in progress . Several thousand physicists , filling every square foot of the huge room , listened intently to an address by the retiring president of the society , Professor John A. Wheeler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming slightly , as Professor Wheeler spoke on " The End of Time , " and afterward we made our way toward the escalators leading to the Sixth Avenue exit from the hotel . On our way down , a physicist standing in front of us on the escalator said to a colleague ascending on an adjacent escalator , " I 'm going for a walk . It 's only Tuesday , but I 'm tired of listening . " ? CONVERSATION overheard on a Fifth Avenue bus between an elderly gentleman and a distinguished-looking matron : GENTLEMAN : When I think of all the tax money they 're spending to get a man up there on the moon ! Who needs a man on the moon , anyhow ? MATRON ( whispering significantly ) : Remember the moon and the tides . The country that controls the moon is the country that controls the tides , Remember that !
