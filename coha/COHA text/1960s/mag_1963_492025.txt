. HOWARD HUGHES HUGHES N ext Monday a remarkable event is scheduled to take place in Los Angeles . Under the solemn instructions of a Federal court , an invisible man is supposed to materialize himself . The man is Howard Robard Hughes , one of the richest men in the world and a legend in his own time , and the court order that he produce his lanky , six-foot , two-inch frame is for the purpose of obtaining his testimony in one of the most massive lawsuits in modern times . What makes his impending appearance of particular interest is that six years ago Hughes vanished from mortal ken much as if he had been whisked away to another galaxy by flying saucer . Since that time he has been sought in vain by armies of skilled detectives . Enormously wealthy and potent financial institutions have laid legal traps for him , all have snapped shut on empty air . A national picture magazine set out to photograph him in his lair and wound up with a picture of his barber . Like all wondrous events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world and the surfacing of the Loch Ness monster  --  the materialization of Howard Hughes in Los Angeles will not necessarily come off on schedule . He has been under court order to appear in lesser cases in the past and has maintained his invisibility by settling out of court at the last minute . What sets this case apart from all others is the size of the stakes . Known throughout the Hughes camp by the simple and ominous name of the Big One , it involves control of the giant Trans World Airlines , in which Hughes owns 78 percent of the stock . Control of T.W.A. , in turn , involves a proposed merger with the Pan American line , which in turn would have a far-reaching effect on the future of American and international air transportation . Beyond this , the Big One involves damage claims and counterclaims totaling $481 million and has tied up Hughes 's control of Hughes Tool Company , the parent cornucopia that spawned the golden seeds for his entire billion-dollar empire . All this adds up to such an enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stature can forfeit it on a whim . " If we lose the Big One , " a Hughes aide says , " the whole empire may go . " Whether the scheduled showdown takes place next week or six months from now , it will be charged with all the drama of Gary Cooper 's lonely battle against a gang of gunslingers in High Noon . It pits Hughes , the last of the great " loners " in America , against an awesome New York financial coalition of some of the largest money organizations in existence . To the bitter enemies of Howard Hughes , any comparison of the lanky , secretive ex-Texan with Gary Cooper 's lonely lawman is intolerable . In their view Hughes is a sort of elusive Black Bart whom the posse of an orderly society is about to flush out of the badlands . This view was recently expressed by a lawyer , John Sonnett , representing the new , banker-controlled management of T.W.A. In a court hearing he described his employers as " men of stature in the business ho kimennd of world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , this a , do n't ' t going oik now w long of ng to take this abuse from a man who has been hiding out , apparently , in one or another back alley , garbage dump , a place in the desert , conducting his business in phone booths or men 's toilets for the sake of secrecy . " At the time of this outburst Hughes was actually installed in a S50,000-a-year leased mansion in Bel-Air , one of four or live expensive establishments among which he moves in great secrecy , like a modern-day Scarlet Pimpernel , while maintaining a constant battle of harassment against his opposition . But in the deeper sense attorney Sonnett 's characterization of Hughes as a sort of ghostly vagrant is an accurate one . Many wealthy persons stay aloof from the polio ' , to be sure . With Hughes , however , total privacy has become an obsession and a way of life . He keeps his person apart not only From the masses but also from the bankers and captains of industry who make up the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure . For years he has been the nearest thing to an Invisible Man outside the pages of H. G. Wells . Actually , Hughes has been gradually waning from view , like the Cheshire cat , for more than twenty years . He always has liked privacy , and when much younger used to disappear for long stretches and bury himself in work . More than 15 years ago his uncle , the late playwright Rupert Hughes , complained , " I can get through to the Almighty by dropping to my knees , but T do n't know how to get in touch with Howard . " ft was only in 1957 that his disappearance became almost total , and even the Cheshire grin vanished . The general manager of one of his enterprises , Hughes Productions , recently testified under oath that he had not even talked to Hughes for five fears . Carter Burgess , onetime president of Trans World Airlines , was named head of that giant corporation , served for nearly a year and resigned without ever meeting the man he worked for . Raymond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the three-man executive committee that runs the whole Hughes empire , solemnly swore a few months ago that he had not seen Hughes since 1959. " 1 do n't know how to get in touch with Mr. Hughes , " said his top executive . A platoon-sized manhunt Beginning a little over a year ago , an intense effort to locate Hughes was launched by a platoon of skilled private investigators , hired by a law firm representing the new , or Wall Street , management of T.W.A. , in order to serve the elusive multimillionaire with legal papers in their battle for the airline . This private manhunt was headed by a shrewd little sleuth named A. B. Leckie , who had unique qualifications for the job . Leckie was the only private investigator ever known to have found Hughes , having traced him years before to a resort hotel in Las Vegas at the behest of a suspicious movie actress whom Hughes had been squiring around . In theT.W , A. manhunt a bizarre secret war was soon raging between Leckie 's legion and Hughes 's own security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at every turn , Leckie finally staked out the residence of Hughes 's top troubleshooter . The Hughes field general spotted the opposition 's field general , sallied forth and gently chided him for playing cloak-and-dagger with another professional . . " Listen , " said the Hughes man , " my boss owns 78 percent of T.W.A. , so we 're paying more than three fourths of your salar ) . Quit hanging around my place and go out and hunt for Mr. Hughes . So long as were paying you , earn your money . " Throughout history men have often withdrawn from the world in a variety of ways for a variety of reasons  --  Thoreau to Walden Pond , St. Simon Stylites to the top of a stone column . the traditional hermit to his cave . What makes the case of Howard Hughes so baffling is that , while he has drawn a cloak of invisibility around himself , he has not actually withdrawn from the world at all , but maintains an intense and possessive interest in his huge financial barony . His enterprises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Texas to Hughes Aircraft , one of the nation 's top missile and electronics concerns , which is now deeply involved in the space program . His Hughes Tool Company has played a key role in the oil industry ; for many years it manufactured the majority of the drilling hits used throughout the entire non-Communist world . T.W.A. is not only a major domestic airline but also the No. 2 U.S. flag carrier in international air travel . Just recently , furthermore , Hughes acquired control of a second airline , Northeast , and entered the field of business-management systems by founding Hughes Dynamics . To run an empire of this magnitude and still never emerge into public sight , Hughes has devised a modus operandi unique in modern corporate management . It centers on a block-long , two-story , buff stucco building at 7000 Romaine Street in Los Angeles . Nowhere does the building carry any sign or inscription identifying it with Hughes or his enterprises . Its first floor appears to be deserted . On the second floor , behind locked doors and drawn blinds , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handful of trusted aides and his private executive secretary of 21 years , Nadine Henley , and staffed by a corps of couriers , chauffeurs and guards . Throughout his empire it is known simply as Operations . Hughes never visits the center , but it provides him with a relay point through which he can get in touch with any of his executives at any time of the day or night . Operations reports to a tall , taciturn , blond Mormon named Bill Gay , a senior vice president who has served Hughes for 10 years and is the only Hughes executive who sees Mr. H. , as the Operations staff calls him , with any regularity . Gay has staffed Operations with fellow Mormons on the theory that his coreligionists are industrious , trustworthy , and resistant to such vices as the use of alcohol , which is notoriously fatal to the practice of tight security . From the message center on Romaine Street , word is frequently sped to Hughes executives to " stand by " for a call from Mr. H. This requires that they suspend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to them . Throughout the Hughes ranks this status is known as " being on the hook , " and it often stretches into a marathon ordeal when Hughes 's attention gets diverted elsewhere . Hughes employees have been known to hang " on the hook " for weeks , if not months . Veteran Hughes men accept this eccentricity philosophically and use their enforced idleness toadvantage . " I once learned a great deal about the family life of pigeons , " says a former Hughes executive . " I was put on standby in a Washington hotel waiting for an urgent call from Hughes . Across the way a pair of pigeons were constructing a nest on a window ledge . They finished it , the mother laid her eggs and hatched them , they fed the brood and finally taught them to fly before Hughes called . It was actually quite fascinating , especially since I was being paid exceedingly well for this bird watching . " Hughes mistrusts even this indirect method of communicating with his aides . When he finally calls someone " on standby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public phone booth , call the message center and leave the number . It is then relayed to Hughes , and he places his call to the public booth . More often than not , these maneuvers take place in the small hours of the morning , a time which Hughes once described as " the wonderful , quiet , clean part of the day . " He wears no watch , sleeps whenever his energy runs out , and works when he wakes , without regard for the conventional schedules that others keep . The unmarked building on Romaine not only helps guard Hughes 's privacy ; it also provides him with money . Hughes draws no regular salary from any of his enterprises but meets his personal expenses , which are fairly enormous , by a typically secretive and indirect method . Once a month large sums are transferred from a Hughes Tool Company ( Toolcol account in Houston , Texas , to Hughes Productions Inc. , an inactive movie making subsidiary of Toolco , on Romaine Street . From the Hughes Productions account money is transferred to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The " L.M. " stands for Lee Murrin , general manager of Hughes Productions , who functions as Hughes 's " money man . " Couriers regularly fetch Hughes 's bills , charge accounts and such to Murrin. who pays them from the L.M Company account . " L.M. Company is n't really a company , " Murrin has explained ; " it 's just  --  well , 1 do n't know . " " Damned odd , but a genius " At the end of the year , Hughes 's personal expenditures are tallied up . and the Toolco board of directors solemnly votes Hughes , who owns every stick of the company , a dividend equalling his expenditures . " Do n't ask me why things are done this way , " says a Hughes aide . " They just arc . " Despite his unorthodox methods , Howard Hughes has , over the years , scored an impressive series of achievements . " Make no mistake about it , " says a former II ughcs executive . " Howard is a genius . A damned odd one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tool Company at the age of 19 on the death of his father , dropping out of school with only a smattering of higher education and no degree . He nurtured his inheritance , stock in Toolco valued at 5660,000 , into a sprawling barony that is now estimated to be worth between 5750 million and one billion dollars . Such a feat in itself is virtually unmatched in American history . Along the way , moreover , Hughes engaged in a series of other careers , anyone of which would tax most men to the utmost . As a youth he designed and built his own steam-powere d auto . He first flew a plane at the age of 14 , and in his 30 's he won most major American aeronautics trophies  --  the Harmon Trophy twice , in 1936 and 1938 , the Collier Trophy in 1939 and the Octave Chanute Award in 1940 . He smashed the transcontinental flight record , set a new mark by circling the globe in three days and 19 hours , and survived four plane crashes . He designed a whole series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still , 15 years after its only flight , far and away the largest aircraft in the world . He invaded the complex and competitive field of moviemaking when still in his 20 's and produced occasionally brilliant  --  although generally unprofitable  --  movies , ranging from Hell 's .4ngels through Scarface to that absurd exercise in bosom fetishism , Jane Russell 's The Outlaw . Along with everything else Hughes managed to earn the reputation of a princely playboy as the escort of a glittering It'ho'N U ho of Hollywood 's most beautiful women , including Billie Dove , Ginger Rogers , Lana Turner , Linda Darnell , Paulette Goddard , Yvonne De Carlo and Katharine Hepburn . He went his own way , made his own rules and involuntarily created his own legend , much of it encrusted in fiction . Millions of Americans , for example , firmly believe that Hughes slouches about his secret way in tennis shoes . An intimate , who has known him for years insists that he has never seen Hughes wear anything less orthodox than wing-tip oxfords . The legend has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran out of shoe-ration stamps , bought a pair of unrationed canvas shoes and wore them to a swank Nevi York nightclub . This merely reflects his gener4 disdain for clothes ; with the world 's best tailors eager to serve him , he prefers ordinary slacks , a white shirt without a necktie , and a leather flight jacket or sport coat . There are countless thousands who believe that the most intimate secrets of Hughes 's closely guarded private life are spread out on the pages of a steamy recent best seller entitled The Carpetbaggers . There is no doubt that a few key incidents of Hughes 's life form a crude skeleton fo the book , but author Harold Robbins denies tha the work is in any sense biography and indeed t finished product is approximately 99 44/100 per cent impure imagination . Much of the fiction about Hughes gains circU , lation because of the obscurity of any facts . H9 has been described variously as " an enormously wealthy Huckleberry Finn , " " a ruthless nego ; .1 ator with the mind of a hostile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and a shy phi ' lanthropist who enjoys doing good but abhorl credit for it . Although Hughes is surrounded by layers of public-relations men , they are forbidde to issue even favorable information about hint He once , for example , sent a plane on a dramatiO mercy flight to obtain an iron lung for the polio ; . stricken young daughter of an acquaintance . Bug when one of the public-relations men suggested that this was a newsworthy story with consider- " If that story publicis ree released , saepdp. appeal , turn Hughes gyhour es snappedre s resignation . " n at ; on " 19 " Hughes gets clobbered with all the bad stories because his enemies always talk freely . " says a publicist . " You could work wonders for his image by telling some of the good stories , but he wo n't allow it . What he really wants is to have nothing written about himself . " In 1957 he married Jean Peters , a soft-spoken , highly literate green-eyed beauty from Ohio . Miss Peters came to Hollywood after winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 20th Century-Fox opposite Tyrone Power in Captain From Castile and starred in Three Coins in the Fountain and A Man Called Peter . The marriage caught Hollywood by surprise ; the film capital had long before decided that Hughes would never marry again . At the age of 19 he had married Ella Rice of Houston  --  one of the Rice Institute Rices  --  and she had divorced him four years later after his exuberant plunge into the bubbly waters of Hollywood . With her marriage to Hughes , Jean Peters promptly became enveloped in much the same cloak of invisibility that hides her husband . Some Hughes associates see a connection between his marriage and his total disappearance from public view . But the two reportedly are happy . If privacy is Hughes 's dominant obsession , hatred of failure runs a close second . Long after others have written off some moribund project he persists in vastly expensive efforts to breathe new life into it . A case in point is Hughes 's giant flying boat . The great plane was a World War II project , planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ambushing Allied convoys in the North Atlantic . Hughes designed the plane and supervised its construction . A radical departure from the mainstream of aviation design , with a capacity of 750 passengers , it was intended to whisk large numbers of troops to Europe safely above the subs . It had a wingspread of 320 feet . a hull as high as a three-story building and a tail assembly eight stories high . Because of wartime plane-metal shortages , Hughes was forced to construct this behemoth of plywood , which prompted the press to tag the plane the Spruce Goose , a flippancy that still reportedly sends Hughes into a dark rage . The original contract for the plane , let in 1942 , provided $18 million in Federal funds for three copies of the giant . By the time a single plane was completed , in 1947 , the war had been over for two years , more than $19 million in Federal cash had been poured into the project , and a Senate committee headed by Owen Brewster was investigating the fiasco . Brewster made the mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably never get into the air . " I have put the sweat of my life into this thing , " Hughes replied . " My reputation is wrapped up in it . I say that if it fails I will leave this country . And I mean it . " Shortly thereafter Hughes took the plane out into the Long Beach , California , harbor for some announced taxiing trials . with himself at the controls . He churned the gigantic craft back and forth several times and then suddenly revved up the motors and worked the 200-ton plane into the air . He flew it for a glorious mile , approximately 70 feet above the harbor . The Federal Government cut oil the subsidy and indicated willingness to liquidate the affair 21 . as just one of those crash wartime projects that had n't worked out . Hughes refused to accept this solution . He continued work on the plane in a huge , windowless , heavily guarded hangar at Long Beach , financing all the costs himself . The plane has never flown again , but work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $50 million of his funds sunk in a plane which no one but he thinks will ever leave the hangar again . To cap the paradox , the plane is the property of the U.S. Government , because of its wartime investment , and is merely leased by Hughes . " The explanation is simple , if you understand Howard , " a former Hughes man says . " The money means nothing , compared with his pride . He detests failure and even hates the sound of the word . If he gave up the Spruce Goose they 'd probably haul the thing out and chop it up for kindling , and there 'd be a lot of pictures in the press . He just ca n't bear the idea , so the work goes on and on and on . " Hughes has often enveloped people in the same mixture of secrecy , possessiveness and large doses of money beneath which he has buried the great flying boat . To the people affected , the prospect of acquiring a generous patron with uncounted millions often seems , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curfew . For some who had experienced it , however , the fairy-tale enchantment is soon replaced by a stifling feeling of being preserved in a very expensive aspic . One who underwent the experience and talks freely about it is Sallilee Conlon , a strikingly attractive girl who is now secretary to a Los Angeles newscaster . In 1953 , when she was 18 , a freshman at Indiana University and a distinctly amateur singer , she was struck by a random bolt of publicity . A national magazine used her picture on the cover in connection with a purported cultural renaissance in the Middle West . Before the week was out she had a breathtaking summons from a Hollywood agent . Accompanied by her mother , stepfather and stepsister , she was flown to Los Angeles , ensconced in an expensive hotel and swiftly auditioned at R.K.O. studio . " The agent told me I had turned out fine , and then he asked me if I would like to meet Howard Hughes , " Miss Conlon says . " We were all flown to Las Vegas , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he peeped out at us suspiciously , with the chain on the door , before he let us in . " Hughes established the family in a $90-a-day suite at El Rancho Vegas , Miss Conlon says , and flew an expensive woman coach out from Hollywood to give her daily singing lessons . " For fire years I took singing lessons three hours a day , every day . For the six months we were in Vegas , I saw Mr. Hughes or talked to him every day  --  and let me make one thing clear  --  always with my family present . " He was a kind , quiet , shy man . And he 's really quite sensitive . Once he routed us all out at three in the morning and flew us over the Grand Canyon to show us the sunrise . He made us all look the other way until just the right moment , when the sun burst over the canyon wall . Then he flew us deep down into the canyon to show us a little hidden green valley he had discovered . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . and he seemed proud of this . ' ' At the end of six months H aches moved the family into ' usurious quarters in Los Angeles . " We still got the treatment , " Miss Conlon says . " A car when we wanted it , the bills paid , and they put my stepfather on some payroll at $25 , - 000 a year . The singing lessons went on for 4 ' 2 years more , but I never saw Mr. Hughes again . I thought for a long time that they were looking for the right role for me . " Then one day , near the end , my voice teacher broke the news to me that I was n't the only girl being ' groomed for stardom . ' " That did it . She called up Hughes 's lawyer and told him that she wanted out . There was n't any fuss about it . He asked her if she needed some money . She said no , " and 1 just walked out into the free air . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did , " she adds . " Sometimes I 'm a little bitter that I never got my big chance , but mainly I guess I 'm just sorry for him . " In one of the few extended interviews he ever granted , long ago , Hughes frankly conceded that his relationships with other people were often highly unsuccessful . For the psychologically oriented , it is interesting that he made the concession in terms of a comparison with his father , a bluff , outgoing man who plainly had a great influence on Hughes . " My father was plenty tough , " Hughes explained to writer Dwight Whitney back in 1948 . " He never suggested that I do something ; he just told me . He shoved things down my throat , and I had to like it . " But he had a hail-fellow-well-met quality that I never had . . . He was a terrifically loved man . I am not . I do n't have the ability to win people the way he did . . I suppose I 'm not like other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not nearly as interested in people as I should he , I guess . What I am tremendously interested in is science , nature in its various manifestations , the earth and the minerals that come out of it . " Proud . prickly as a cactus , preoccupied , secretive and stubborn , Hughes has had a number of disastrous blowups with his top executives . These invariably have been resolved by the executives ' suddenly becoming ex-executives . It was a series of these personnel schisms that led to the present financial crisis that confronts Howard Hughes . The most disastrous break came in 1957 when he split with Noah Dietrich , his $500,000-a-year executive officer . " Dietrich really ran the empire , " says an associate , " particularly the financial end of it . Hughes had always had a problem coming to a decision . He would let the most urgent matters dangle for months while he focused his attention on something that was basically trivial . Dietrich made the decisions and kept things moving . " This worked smoothly for 32 years until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Houston on a pressing mission . Dietrich , who was then in his late 60 's , had recently decided to exercise a clause in his contract permitting him to take a capital gain , but Hughes had kept putting him off . Relations between the two men hadbeen somewhat strained for several months . At this point Dietrich telephoned Hughes to say that he wanted the matter taken care of before he went to Houston . " You arc holding a gun at my head . " Hughes said . There were some short , angry words , and the two associates of 32 years hung up on each other . The break was sharp , swift and permanent . The nest morning all the locks were changed at 7000 Romaine Street ; Dietrich found himself barred from his office and most of his associates discharged . The break with Dietrich came at a time when Hughes needed him sorely . The airlines were entering the jet age , and Hughes faced the enormous problem of financing the conversion of T.W.A. to jets  --  a changeover that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hughes had built up the airline by pumping large sums into it from his fantastically profitable Hughes Tool Company , but not even that cornucopia of cash could meet the demands of the jet program . Hughes began stalking Wall Street for help  --  and Wall Street began stalking Hughes . For years the financial community of the East had eyed the holdings of this western lone wolf , but he had refused to sell any of his holdings or even dilute his one-man proprietorship . For several years Hughes staved off a final decision . In 1960. however , the crisis put his back to the wall . In a dramatic series of events , the story of which is now slowly unfolding in the courts , Hughes got the financing he needed  --  and completely lost control of his favorite possession , Trans World Airlines . " Nobody forces his hand " What triggered the loss of the airline 's control , ironically . was another personal clash between Hughes and an executive . By the summer of 1960 Hughes and a coalition of giant insurance companies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in financing for T.W.A. It contained a brief proviso that there be no adverse change in the top management . President of T.W.A. at the time was Charles S. Thomas , former Secretary of the Navy , under whose two-year tenure T.W.A. had run well in the black . Before the financing was concluded , according to an affidavit filed by a Hughes attorney , Thomas made certain financial demands to stay on as president . " Thomas thought he was in a strategic position , " says a T.W.A. publicist . " But nobody forces Howard 's hand . He told Thomas to go fly a kite  --  and lost his airline . " In July , 1960 , Thomas suddenly resigned . The prospective lenders , citing this as an " adverse change , " backed off the loan  --  unless Hughes agreed to place his 78 percent of T.W.A. 's stock in a voting trust controlled by the lenders . With time run out , massive obligations due and the banks threatening to call his loans , Hughes signed over his stock to a three-man voting trust  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lenders . " From that point on , you 'd never even think we owned T.W.A. , " says a Hughes colleague . The Hughes camp charges that the loan has unprecedented and harsh provisions . They corn-plain that the interest rate is higher than that of any other major airline financing , and that Hughes will have to pay a 22-percent penalty if he gets new financing to take T.W.A. out of hock . They charge that the lenders have encumbered T.W.A. with vast new loans to perpetuate their control , without Hughes 's consent . And they add that the airline has been run deeply into the red since the lenders took over , compared with a cumulative $95 million profit under Hughes management . For months Hughes nursed his wounds in silence . He resigned as president of Hughes Tool Company . named an executive committee to run his empire and focused all his attention on regaining T.W.A. As with everything else connected with Howard Hughes , the magnitude or the battle overwhelms the imagination . To date the western maverick and his eastern enemies have slugged each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern lenders struck first . In June , 1961 , T.W.A. under its new management sued Hughes for $115 million , charging violation of antitrust laws and alleging that he had damaged the airline by delaying its jet-financing program and by eccentric management . The suit asked that Hughes be forced to yield ownership of his T.W.A. stock . Hughes struck back with a counterclaim for $366 million against Equitable Life , Metropolitan Life , Irving Trust , Dillon , Read and Company , T.W.A. and several individuals . The Hughes claim charges the lenders with antitrust violation , violation of the Federal Aviation Act , and a conspiracy to perpetuate their control over T.W.A. through the voting trust . It asks the court to abolish the trust and return the airline to its rightful daddy . The eastern camp parried with a new suit requesting the court to seize Hughes 's stock in his parent corporation , Hughes Tool Company , to force him to appear and testify in the easterners ' original suit . Since Hughes owns all the stock in Hughes Tool , and that company is worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue chips in the center of the table to nearly the one-billion-dollar mark . Shortly after this , Hughes quietly accepted service in the T.W.A. case  --  typically , not in person but by having his lawyers file an affidavit  --  thereby making himself available for testimony . Last December 20 the boards of directors of T.W.A. and Pan Am voted to merge those two great lines , an action which may in effect require White House approval . Standing squarely in the path of this wedding of sky giants is the stubborn figure of the Texas loner who owns 78 percent of T.W.A. and who , as an aide puts it , " does n't like someone monkeying with something he looks upon as his . " " Whichever way things go next week or next month , do n't count Hughes out , " says an associate . " He 's got the patience of a stone , and he 's always thinking five years ahead . He can outwait anybody  --  and he did n't get where he is today by losing the big fights . " THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benjamin Franklin Literary &; Medical Society .
