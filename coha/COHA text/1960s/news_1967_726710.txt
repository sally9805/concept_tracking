txt Government authorities , their hopes for a quick tax increase crumbling , are mobilizing to keep their own forecasts of consequent financial catastrophes from coming true . Even without fiscal restraint , they insist now , the nation does n't face credit strains great enough to choke off the long economic uptrend . But the atmosphere is clearly tense enough that Johnson Administration and Federal Reserve officials are prepared to act to keep any isolated financial disasters from developing into nationwide chaos . " A crunch like last year 's could n't be tolerated again , " says one well-placed analyst , recalling the near-panic in money markets during the credit-tight summer of 1966 . The interestrate escalation any repetition would bring , he warns , implies " financial-institution failures on a large scale  --  could any democratic government stand that ? " Possible Courses of Action Hence , Government men are : ? Considering how they might revamp interest-rate ceilings for banks and savings and loan associations so as to plug potential dollar drains from thrift institutions . ? Accumulating quietly a cache of extra funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willingness to pump newly created money directly from the Federal Reserve System into any severely drained S &Ls.; ? Declaring an open mind toward " selective controls " on credit or whatever else it may take to maintain financial order . Far better than having to resort to such rescue efforts , officials say , would be to keep credit markets well enough stocked to meet all real needs and prevent interest rates from soaring . Mostly to this end , the Federal Reserve Board is currently continuing to pour massive amounts of new money into the banking system . But officials worry lest this further fuel inflation . The centerpiece of anti-panic planning is still the proposed income tax increase ; it #muld give the Treasury some 410-billion a year snore in revenues and accordingly reduce its need to compete for funds in Straining capital markets . But some Administration men think Congress may not be sufficiently stirred up about price and interest-rate increases to pass it before next July 1 . And the pessimists in the Administration are n't sure they can ever break the deadlock with Congress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon develop . The pressure on the home loan field , warns President Raymond H. Lapin of the mortgage-buying Federal National Mortgage Association , " will be so severe that it will blot out all memory of 1966 . " ( Fannie Mae 's purchases of mortgages rose sharply in the September quarter . See story page 23 . ) Adds another official : " There are some savings-and-loans that could fold at any moment . " Such failures , Federal officials worry , might well be interpreted as only the first in a series . Running Scared Yet the planners admit they do n't have a very clear idea of the dimensions of any coming crunch . " We have to run scared , " says one . " We think in terms of chaos . " A credit crisis , grumbles another , " is not the most well-defined concept we deal with . " It might be , he says , very much like what happened suddenly in the late summer of 1966 , when for a few hours one day some prospective sellers of Government securities feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say such " disorderly market conditions , " if unchecked , could cause a cascading cutoff of all new credit that conceivably could seriously damage the entire economy . The extra borrowing the Treasury will have to do next spring unless it gets a tax boost in time could overload the credit markets , some strategists suspect . " The Treasury might put out a new securities offer and then find that people just are n't all that interested in buying , " one says . At least a few sizable institutional investors are already letting authorities know that they have soured on long-term Treasury issues because of losses they have suffered ; one key bond that sold for $97 per $100 of face value back in January , for instance , lately has been fetching about $82 . Irresistible Rates Most likely , even the pessimists agree , the Treasury could avoid having its securities snubbed by offering irresistibly high interest rates . Put this , the pessimists add , would risk upsetting the nation 's whole interest-rate structure . Trouble might come by a process called " disintermeclia.tion. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as S &Ls; and bank savings accounts to put directly into corporate or Government securities . ( Last year , recalls one official , " we thought the home-builders were crying wolf " when they warned that climbing mortgage interest rates could cause construction to plummet . " We found there really was a. wolf , " he adds , as the intermediaries became so short of lendable cash that housing starts crashed last autumn to the lowest level since World War II . ) Federal regulatory authorities say they are better equipped to deal with a disintermedia  --  ion threat now because of the flexible power Congress granted them in 1966 to control the interest rates that banks and S &Ls; can offer . If . for instance . too much money should go into marketable bank " certificates of deposit " and too little to Skis . the regulators could simply reset the rate ceilings to give an edge to the S &Ls.; While they strongly prefer to leave ceilings antoodbed most of the time , Ngh officials sag they oda* well have to make changes next ageism to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like this , but they can stand it better , " one aide says . Clearly , Washington ranks S &Ls; as the most vulnerable to loss of funds when interest rates are rising , because of basic limitations on their income . Even if permitted to pay sharply higher rates than now , officials say , the associations could n't afford to do so for long . " It would n't make any difference how high a rate they would start charging on mortgage loans either , " because for years they would have to depend mostly on the income from mortgages they made a long time ago at lower rates , " one official adds . Even if interest rates stay about where they are , Federal aides worry they may have to take special steps to protect S &Ls.; The latest Treasury note offer carried a 53i5 ; , interest rate , and some blue-chip corporate issues are carrying yields approaching 61 , L. , , ; ; Federal ceilings limit the savings associations generally to 51 ? ; ) on certificate accounts and to only 411% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to S &Ls; slow much , the Federal Home Loan Banks , which serve as credit reservoirs for savings and loan associations , are determined to be better prepared than last year to make up for it by loans to needy S &Ls.; " We 've got about $2 billion in liquid assets now , " roughly three times the ready cash the FHLB system had when the 1966 pinch hit , says a Home Loan Bank Board official . It 's better for the Home Loan Banks to keep the money on hand ( usually invested in short-term Treasury securities ) than to have to borrow it once the need arises , planners say ; the banks ' own borrowing at such times might merely divert money from the S &Ls.; Fed 's New Role If the Home Loan Banks do have to borrow a lot of money anyway , officials note , the Federal Reserve could case the task . Under legislation passed after last year 's near-panic , the Reserve Board was authorized to buy securities of these and other Federal agencies as part of the " open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Reserve could only buy issues that are already in private hands , but officials figure the purchases would make room in private portfolios for new issues . In any case , the thrift institutions " are certainly in much better financial condition today than they were " in the last money pinch , says Robert A. Wallace , Assistant Treasury Secretary . By the end of September , the $141 billion S &L; industry had worked down its debt to the Home Loan Banks to $4.1 billion from $7.2 billion a year earlier and had built up reserves of cash and Government securities totaling $12.1 billion , $2 billion more than a year before . This is n't quite as comforting to Federal officials as it might be , though . Explains one : " The trouble is that the associations that need more reserves the most are n't the ones that have them . " Despite repeated warnings , insiders say , a troublesome minority of S &Ls; still pay excessive salaries and make high-yielding but questionable loans . Officials worry that even some individually sound associations are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that control them . Rather than let shaky S &Ls; threaten the nation 's whole financial structure , officials expect the Federal Reserve Board would throw open its regional banks ' loan windows to those in urgent need of cash . Normally , only commercial banks are welcome to this source of newly created money , and then only in small amounts for short times . But as the credit situation grew tense last year . the board voted to make " emergency credit facilities " available to any S &Ls; or mutual savings banks that needed them between July 1 , 1966. and March 1 . 1967 : the standby authority , which was not actually used , has since lapsed , but it could be reinstated at any time . Credit Controls If the worst crisis appeared likely to materialize , the Government 's credit controls could wane rapidly . Even then , a detailed network of World War II-type restrictions would remain unlikely , analysts say , because of a politically embarrassing prerequisite ; President Johnson would have to proclaim a national war emergency . But the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the considerable powers it already possesses . A possible prototype of future action is the Reserve Board 's " Sept. 1 letter " of last year , warning commercial banks that they could expect fewer loans from the regional Federal Reserve Banks unless they restrained their own lending to corporate customers and their sell-offs of local government securities While many bankers resented the unaccustomed pressure , otficiaLs generally figure the leverage was effective .
