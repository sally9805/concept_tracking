People buy foreign goods for many reasons : novelty , fashion , durability , economy , snob appeal . Whatever the reasons , U.S. imports traditionally run at about 3% of the gross national product . That total tends to rise sharply , however , in times of prosperity - and this year it has spurted faster than at any time in a decade . The surge may satisfy the fanciers , and the sellers , of Dutch beer , Swiss watches or Italian fashions , but it bothers the U.S. Government . The nation 's trade surplus - the excess of exports over imports-is rapidly shrinking , thus reducing the base that the U.S. has used to support its foreign and military aid in the face of its chronic balance of payments deficit . <P> Last week the Commerce Department reported that imports soared 12% in this year 's first nine months , to an annual rate of $20.4 billion . At the same time , exports rose only 3% , to a rate of $25.7 billion . This unfavorable turn has cut the U.S. trade surplus from last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve a surplus in the overall balance of payments . The Commerce Department , which last week estimated that U.S. payments ran a deficit of $200 million to $400 million during the third quarter , expects the nation to dip into the red by some $1.5 billion for the full year . <P> Shoes &; Scotch . What foreign goods do Americans hanker for ? U.S. companies , of course , have their own special needs ; the fastest-rising major import so far this year is steel , which has risen 68% to $864 million . But consumer goods account for a full 40% of imports , include some of the sharpest gainers . The U.S. demand for Italian shoes , Pucci pants and British woolens has lifted imports of clothes and tex tiles this year by 18% , to $853 million . Purchases of leisure goods-German toys , Japanese baseball gloves , French musical instruments and the like-have risen 20% , to $187 million . Electrical apparatus , notably Japanese transistor radios and TV sets , are up 39% , to $429 million . Among other gainers : Danish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The import spurt would be easier to tolerate if exports were keeping pace . Export growth has been stunted by several factors : dock strikes in the U.S. , the slowing of business expansion in Europe and Japan , Britain 's 10% sur charge on imports , and the worldwide plunge in commodities prices , which the underdeveloped nations depend on to earn foreign exchange . And , despite denials from U.S. officials , many businessmen suspect that the " voluntary " cutback of U.S. loans abroad has also hurt the nation 's exports by drying up dollars in Europe .
