ALONE among the Arab states sharing borders with Israel , tiny cosmopolitan Lebanon had escaped direct involvement in the Middle East 's frequent outbursts of hostility . Like Arabs everywhere else , the Lebanese of course paid lip service and tithes to the Arab cause against Israel , but they were far more interested in commerce than in aggressive politics . The Beirut government dutifully declared war against Israel during last year 's Six-Day War-and sent two fighters on a sortie southward toward Tel Aviv . When one was shot down , Lebanon happily withdrew from the campaign , its duty done . <P> Last week violence came to Lebanon with a vengeance . In perhaps the single most audacious military exploit in their already spectacular history , Israeli forces swept down in helicopters on Beirut 's busy international airport , through which thousands of Arab and Western tourists and businessmen pass each day . In 45 minutes , the attackers wreaked an Israeli-estimated $100 million in damage . A dozen Lebanese civilian planes were destroyed or heavily damaged , hangars and fuel dumps set afire , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a swift , surgical and devastating raid , carried out in the most unlikely of places-and it once again raised the stakes in the Middle East , edging the area closer to another full-scale war . <P> It was also an action certain to bring down upon Israel fresh accusations that it overreacts to Arab provocations . The incitement in this instance had taken place only two days before , at Athens ' international airport . There , a New York-bound Boeing 707 belonging to El Al , the Israeli airline , and carrying 41 passengers and a crew of ten had just moved away from its loading ramp when two men dashed onto the runway . Opening a canvas travel bag , they snatched out an automatic rifle and four incendiary grenades and fired a fusillade of bullets at the fuselage . They killed one passenger . <P> Fiery Mangled Metal . The gunmen carried leaflets from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , the Arab guerrilla outfit that hijacked an El Al airliner last July . In Beirut , P.F.L.P. immediately distributed a triumphant communique identifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maher Hussein Yamani , 19 . They now face possible death sentences in the Greek courts . <P> In accordance with a policy of holding Arab governments responsible for fedayeen terrorism , Israel quickly blamed Lebanon . The terrorists , said a Tel Aviv statement , had flown to Athens from Beirut 's airport , and belonged to a group of Arab saboteurs based in Lebanon . " The mark of Cain is on the heads of the perpetrators , " declared Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol . The Middle East has learned to take such Israeli warnings seriously , and Lebanon braced for some sort of reprisal . It came within 48 hours , but on a scale no one would have dared predict .
