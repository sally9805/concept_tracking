The first public reaction of the U.S. Government to news of the coup in South Viet Nam ( see cover story ) was to throw up its hands and disclaim any sort of responsibility . <P> The whole bloody affair , insisted Washington officials , had been planned and carried out by the outraged Vietnamese subjects of President Ngo Dinh Diem and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu . Declared State Department Press Officer Richard Phillips : " I can categorically state that the U.S. Government was not involved in any way . " Said an other Administration official about the Vietnamese : " It 's their country , their war , and this is their uprising . " <P> The Pressures . These denials were misleading . At week 's end , amid the confusions of the Saigon coup , it was still unclear as to the extent to which the U.S. , through its military or intelligence forces in South Viet Nam , had actively assisted in the uprising . But there could be no question that the U.S. , in the policies and in the pressures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Diem regime . Only a few weeks ago President Kennedy , appearing on a television interview with C.B.S . ' s Walter Cronkite , argued that the winning of the war against the Communist Viet Cong would probably require " changes in policy , and perhaps in personnel " in the Diem government . Along about that time there was much talk in Saigon and Washington about a U.S.-backed takeover by Vietnamese military leaders . Then the coup chatter seemed to quiet down-which may have been a sign that a coup was in the making . <P> Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Maxwell Taylor flew to Viet Nam , reported back ( at least for public consumption ) that despite the shortcomings of the Diem regime , the war against the Communists was still being won . As it happens , Taylor is an old tennis-playing acquaintance of Vietnamese Lieut . General Duong Van Minh-who last week headed the junta that took power . <P> During that same period , the U.S. stepped up its economic pressure against the Diem regime , suspending a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodities that ran to $2,000,000 a month , cutting off part of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency 's $350,000 in monthly payments to the Vietnamese Special Forces , and stopping funds used to finance Ngo Dinh Nhu 's secret police . <P> All this could , of course , be only an invitation to overthrow . And despite the earlier denials , Administration officials seemed satisfied about the fact that U.S. policies had helped bring an end to the Diem regime . As for the aura of total surprise that Washington sought to set up , its validity was best expressed by a U.S. official : " Hell , there 's been so much advance knowledge we ca n't possibly imagine why the Diem government did n't know , too . " Perhaps it did-but was unable to do much about it . <P> The Investment . The U.S. has a longstanding investment , both in money and blood , in the fate of Viet Nam . It would , therefore , be preposterous to propose that the U.S. should have no interest in the makeup and effectiveness of the Vietnamese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
