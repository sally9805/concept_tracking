txt George S. Kaufman , the playwright , director and producer , died yesterday of a heart attack at his home , 1035 Park Avenue . His was 71 years old . He had been in poor health since suffering a stroke about a year and a half ago , and in recent months had been virtually inactive . Mr. Kaufman ranked among the biggest money makers in the history of the American theatre . For twenty years ? from 1921 until the United States entered World War II ? he had at least one hit on Broadffay , either as author or direc ' tor or both , nearly every year . Eighteen of Mr. Kaufman 's plays ran 200 or more performances , and more than twenty were sold to the movies . Two of his projects won Pulitzer Prizes for drama . The first was " Of Thee I Sing , " written with Morrie Ryskind and Ira Gershwin and produced in 1931 . A genial spoof on Presidential elections , it enjoyed a successful revival in 1952 . Mr. Kaufman 's second prizewinner was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written with Moss Hart in 1936 . It concerned an amusingly eccentric family . Despite his phenomenal record of success , Mr. Kaufman 's mien and manner justified his title as " the gloomy dean of humor . " With rave reviews in his pocket he would prowl about a packed theatre , mumbling angrily , eyes mournful under heavy brows and tearing his hair as he paced from orchestra to backstage to box office . In 1941 , Mr. Kaufman temporarily lost the touch that had made him so successful on // Broadway . During the Forties he continued his active role with the theatre in various enterprises , but scored only one hit ? a dramatization of J. P. Marquand 's novel , " The Late George Apley . " In 1950 he again reached the theatrical heights , directing the musical , " Guys and Dolls . " It had a Broadway run of 1,200 performances , and later achieved success as a motion picture . Mr. Kaufman also was associated with other successful Broadway productions . With Howard Teichmann , he wrote the hit play , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was sold to the movies after a long run . ' Silk Stockings ' In ' 55 In 1955 , he was co-author with his wife , Leueen , and Abe Burrows , of the musical hit , " Silk Stockings , " which was purchased by MetroGoldwyn-Mayer . Two years later he directed Peter Usti- , nov 's comedy , " Romanoff and Juliet . " Among the other plays that Mr. Kaufman directed were " Front Page , " " June Moon , " " Let ' Em Eat Cake , " ' ! Bring on the Girls , " " Of Mice and Men , " " I 'd Rather Be Right , " " My Sister Eileen " and " The American Way . " Late in 1959 , Mr. Kaufman was reported to be collaborating with Miss , from whom he had been divorced in August , 1957 , on a new comedy that bore the working title of " The Common Language . " The title later was changed to " I Give it Six Months , " and last month Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the producer . Mr. Manchester said yesterday that the comedy , which is about a love affair between a visiting female British poet and a New Yolk cab driver , was still scheduled to appear here in the early fall . Mr. Kaufman was born in Pittsburgh to middle-class parents who were unsuccessful in business . He went to public schools in Pittsburgh and Paterson , N. J. , where the family later lived . He studied law for three months , but quit to become a wholesale ribbon salesman . Started as Humor Columnist At this time he began contributing quips and humorous , verse to Franklin P. Adams ' column in the old New York Mail . One day , Mr. Adams ( known as F. P. A. ) took his faithful contributor to lunch , ' thus starting a long friendship . ' Mr. Adams helped Mr. Kaufman get his first newspaper job as humor columnist on The Washington Times at $25 a week in 1912 . The novice was fired the next year , however . When Mr. Adams transferred to The New York Tribune in 1914 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on The ' Mail . When Mr. Kaufman was ! discharged again in 1915 , his faithful friend obtained a place for him as drama reporter on ' The Tribune , where the young man worked under the late Heywood Braun . In 1917 The New York Times engaged Mr. Kaufman as a writer in the drama department . He became drama editor and remained at The Times until 1930 . The young reporter soon tried to construct plays himself . The first script he could not sell ; the next two were made into plays that speedily closed . For ' his first success , Mr. Kaufman was again indebted to Mr. Adams . Borrowing one of the columnist 's favorite characters , Dulcinea , a girl so dull that her bromides were funny , Mr. Kaufman wrote in collaboration with Marc Connelly a comedy called " Dulcy , " which became the hit of the 1921-22 season . This collaboration was fruitful and resulted in seven more plays by 1924 , five of them hits . The best- remembered of these are " Merton of the Movies , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a satire on American business life done in expressionistic technique , in 1924 . Separating amicably from Mr. Connelly , Mr. Kaufman alone wrote the " Butter and Egg Man , " in 1925 and the book for the Marx Brothers ' musical , " The Coconuts , " the same year . Worked With Edna Ferber However , Mr. Kaufman preferred a collaborator , and afterward he rarely worked alone . One of his happiest collaborations Was with the novelist Edna Ferber . Their " Royal Family , " an exaggerated comedy about the Barrymores , was a hit in 1927 and is still revived . They also scored with " Dinner at Eight , " in 1932 , and " Stage Door , " in 1936 , both of which Mr. Kaufman also directed . He later collaborated with Miss on " Fancy Meeting You Again , " presented in 1952 , and with Miss Katharine Dayton on " First Lady , " which also opened that year . Among his plays that made history at the time were " I 'd Rather Be Right , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun at the New Deal and starred George 1M . Cohan as Franklin D. Roose , velt . The play opened in Washington in 1938 , with the President enjoying it heartily . With Mr. Hart , also , Mr. Kaufman wrote the memorable " Once in a Lifetime , " in 1930 , and a lampoon of Alexander Wollcott called the " Man Who Came to Dinner , " in 1939 . In the former , a satire on Hollywood , Mr. Kaufman made his only appearance as an actor . He played a movie script writer dying of underwork . An Eccentric Character Mr. Kaufman was an eccentric character . He was always hatless , his bushy pompadour untidy , He talked to himself and grimaced as he walked along the street . Detesting vegetables , he was said to subsist on meat , bread and chocolate peppermints . Mr. Kaufman did not spare himself in his terse , mordant observations . On the opening . night of " The Solid Gold Cadillac , " while he was brooding more deeply than usual awaiting the outcome , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vainly to break through the pessimism , Mr. Teichmann said , " Nice day . " Mr. Kaufman responded : " It was a nice day when they burned Joan of Arc . " Miss Ferber scored a minor triumph , taking advantage of /his habit of pacing around rooms while working and scru ! tinizing anything within reach . ' During their collaboration , she scribbled on a note and buried it face down among personal papers on her desk . Eventually , the prowling Mr. Kaufman came upon it and read : " George Kaufman is an old snoop . " Poker Game Wit I Those who knew him best ' said that some of his best lines were delivered during the poker /sessions he attended as a memiber of the Thanatopsis Literary Inside Straight Club . Here , however , he specialized in puns . One of the most repeated was : " One man 's Mede is another Iman 's Persian . " Mr. Kaufman was bored by theories on his comedy formula , some of which reduced his plays almost to metronomic rhythm . Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " All I do is try to get as many laughs as I can , and the bigger the better . " Mr. Kaufman 's first marriage , to Beatrice Bakrow , survived luridly reported stories linking him romantically with Mary Astor , the actress . His wife died in 1945 and he then married Miss . Surviving are a daughter by his first wife , Mrs. Irving Schneider ; two sisters , Mrs. Ruth Friedlich and Mrs. Helen Lieberman , and a granddaughter . A funeral service will be held at noon tomorrow at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Church , Madison Avenue at Eighty-first Street .
