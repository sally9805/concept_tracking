Birmingha m August 18th 1785 Proffessor Robison Dear Sir It gave me pleasure to hear from you by the receipt of yours of the firth Blank Mr. Boulton is now in Cornwall where he probably will remain for a month or two I shall transmit your letter to him this post While you wait his answer it may not be amiss for you to know the following particulars Mr. B. has only a small share in the lamp business I believe only 1 The rest belongs to Mr. Parker ' and to Mr. Argand the Inventor who is a most worthy and ingenious man Mr. A. has made two sorts of his lamps which have the flame at top as you describe one of which is in sale the oil in it is raised by a pump about once in 2 an hour The other which I believe he has not yet published though it is about a year since he made it at which time he showed me a drawing of it , has the oil kept always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water which drains from an upper reservoir into a lower one , and is so contrived that while any of the oil remains it is kept exactly to the same level and this I apprehend is the principle of Mr. Keirs lamp ? Mr. Argands patent is not for any form of a lamp but for the Cylindric wick and the Glass chimney , so that I apprehend any body using either of these improvements would lye within the patent . This matter will be soon tried , that is in the next term as Mr. Argand and company have brought an action against certain people in London who have infringed on their patent If his patentees should be defeated Mr. K 's invention will be of no value , as not only the most valuable part of the contrivance will lie open to the tinmen at large who will run down one anothers prices , and if he Mr. K/ were to have a patent for his particular method of supplying the lamp his enemies would unite against him as they have done against Argand and he would find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord deliver us ? If Mr. Argand and Company should gain the suit then Mr. K. can not make nor sell his lamps in England without their leave and without his lamp has some thing in it preferable to theirs which Mr. A has contrived himself  | I should hardly expect they would give him much for it , but as an Ingenious man and good work man they would probably employ him and give him proper wages , All that I have said you must consider as coming only from me and not from any of them , and as impartial , for I am no way concerned in it otherwise than from/ my friendship for Mr. B. and Mr. A. The latter Gentleman is now in fiance and I apprehend that in no case any agreement could be made with Mr. K. untill his return Mr. Benny William Parker , London glass-maker and instrument-maker , friend of Dr Priestley .

I now write on the account of my friend Dr. Stokesl of Stourbridge , who I suppose you will recollect to have studied at Edinburgh . There being room for another Physician at Shrewsbury by the death of Doctor Owen , ' he proposes to remove to that place and to be a Candidate for the office of one of the physicians to the County/ Hospital there , and as in these cases , it is wished to have reccommendations from the universities where the Candidates have studied , as well as from other Physicians of eminence , he means to apply to you for such Character as you may think he merited while with you , and as my acquaintance with him has been of several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his behaviour and Character among his friends here , will no ways disgrace any reccommendation you may be pleased to bestow upon him .

Since he left Edinburgh he has been on the Continent and attended the Hospitals for some time at Paris and at Vienna . I need say no more , as your Character of him must be given from your own Observations , but I thought it might be proper for you to know that he had not changed for the worse since he left you Doctor Priestley has lately made some new and interesting experiments he finds on disolving Charcoal by boiling in spirit of nitre that it produces a considerable quantity of air about half of which is nitrous  | air and the remainder a mixture of fixt and phlogisticated air , but most fixt air ?

August 1 786 My dear Watt Any letter from you is a feast to me tho it do not contain philosophical news . I gave Mr. Campbell who is son to Lord Stonefeildl and nephew to Lord Bute a letter of introduction to you this Summer but contrary to his intention he went to London and returned without touching at Birmingham . Haveing been alarmed about your health not long before , I took the liberty in that letter to recommend what I have found the most beneficial in my own Case which is to take regularly a sufficient quantity of exercise .

The price is io/ per Quart , but what quantity that will varnish I can not inform you , nor easily learn from Nostrum mongers , there is also the Black amber varnish , which you know ; it requires a heat of between 300 and 400d to dry it thoroughly The Copal varnish will not bear more than about 130d and preserve its Colour , but will dry moderately hard in the summer air . If you will write to me how much you want I shall procure it and send it to you via London or by the Waggon I am much obliged to you for your advice , in regard to my health , which I practise as much as I can . However the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by too little I was in London , in very indifferent weather , and struggling to get my business done and to get home I exerted myself too much The animal spirits became exhausted and the vital powers sunk to a very Low ebb , When I walked or used any exercise I was seized with a quick breathing like a person in a fever , which at length became continual , I lived abstemiously by way of curing it , but I grew weaker . I made a shift to get home where Doctor Withering ordered me Decoction of Bark and Ether with volatile tincture of Guiacum , to eat nourishing and high seasoned food and to drink as much Madeira as I could ; by following his advice I grew better slowly but have taken all summer to recover I am now in tolerable good health and spirits , but I fear the first fit of vexation or anxiety will throw me back again , in spite of regimen or Medicine , but I must do the best I can , and it is lucky that such vexations do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , nor do so many things vex me I am happy to hear by Mr. Guyot and some other of your pupils that your health is tolerable and I hope the summer has still improved it .

Birmingham February 4th 1788 Dear Doctor I should have writen to you sooner after my arrival here , which was on the Tuesday evening after I left you , but have had many letters to write and not over much alive . We had a pleasant Journey considering the season and it was of service to my health as it wrought off the asthma Mrs. Watt got a cold in the Newtown , which has not yet quite left her , but she is much better . The children are well and James returns you many thanks for the fossil wood .

( He was obliged to have recourse to the Copper because he burst so many Glass vessels ) after several explosions he obtained a small quantity of a blue solution of copper which was examined by Dr Withering and Mr. Keir and found to be a solution of copper in nitrous acid . I have my doubts yet concerning these experiments but from them it would appear 1st that a very large proportion of all airs even 9/10 is water ad that nitrous acid is a component part of Dephlogisticated air as well as of phlogisticated air or at least that Dephlogisticated and inflammable together form it and that probably phlogisticated air is some modification of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflammable airs were the purest he ever had and that the Dephlogisticated had an exceeding small proportion of phlogisticated if any . There it stands at present , but all  | may be changed again in a few months , a fresh opening seems to be made for the phlogistonians and Mr. Lavoisier must mend his theories , or confute the experiments . Mr. Keir has printed some sheets of his dictionary , but goes on slowly , not quite through acid yet . I beg to remind you of your promise to visit us this ensuing summer which I earnestly entreat you to keep , every body here who know sic you would be happy to see you and I hope you will bring Dr. Hutton with you , perhaps we may find some stones for him , and our Iron works will please you both At present I have nothing else new to inform you except one or two more formidable new invented fire Engines , but they give me little pain , they may vanish in fumo and leave only a stink behind them , or if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else or live in quiet on what I have got . at present we have a good many orders .

Dol . Edinburgh February 5 1 788 Dear Sir You will perhaps be surprised at a letter from me chasing you home , but it comes in my usual Stile of Petition , a liberty for which nothing can plead my Excuse but my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Streets I have been rumaging the Shops for a handsome Silver Cup for a present to a person to whom I am much obliged , but every thing ornamental is done here so rudely that I am disgusted with the work . It occurred to me that at Birmingham , where such an immense quantity of plate is manufactured , and tools and molds for every kind of ornament are in profusion , a piece of work of this kind must be had in perfection , and I flattered myself that you would have no reluctance to exercising your Taste and your freindly attention to serve me . Permit me therefore , good Sir , to beg that you would take the trouble of procuring for me as handsome a thing as Twenty pounds or Guineas will purchase . I wish it to hold not less than three English pints , so as to serve for Porter , the use to which they are generally applied in this Country . I wish it also without a Cover , which is a considerable addition to the price , without adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Servant on the Side Board when the Cup itself is in Use . For the same reason ( i:e : to make a good appearance at a moderate Cost ) I have no objection to the Cup not being in the very fashion of the day , because a thing may be equally handsome of a year or two prior date , and the Silver Smith will be willing to part with it on more easy terms . To tell the truth I do not passionately admire Etruscan Simplicity when outree , as is the mode just now . I saw one the other day four or five years old , which pleased me much . The handles were something in this Stile I do nt mean to order one to be made with the ornaments in any particular Stile , because this brings an additional Expence but if you meet with such a thing , if out of the ordinary jog trot fashion , so much the better : and I think that in this way I may have something handsome and honest like for the Sum I mentioned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would look more like ostentation than the desire of a friendly remembrance by means of the Keepsake . It is very possible that I am desiring of you a favour which will subject you to a trouble which woud be quite unreasonable . If so , I trust that you will frankly say that  | you have no ready opportunity of helping me to what I want , and I will immediately write to an acquaintance in London to look out for it . I should not have asked this favour if I had not thought that you could do it without difficulty on any of your morning walks among the Tradesmen , and I was certain that if this was the Case I would get my purpose better answered and at less expence , thro ' your kindness than by applying to any other Person . After having said so much about this trifle I am almost ashamed to request that you would take the trouble of writing me a line or two informing me what I may expect thro ' your good offices . I wish that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been exceedingly ill since I had the pleasure of seeing you , and see no prospect of amendment . But I allways am with the greatest Esteem Dear Sir Your obedient humble Servant John Robison NB I wish the engraving on the Cup to be of that kind most commonly put on plate , i:e , done with the chisel or scraper , which gives a brilliancy not to be had au Burin .

Allow me then with the same frankness to request that you will order the Cup to be made at Mr. Bolton 's Manufactory . I wish it to be of as Large a size as can be made out of forty ounces without being flimsy . It need not be stout , because in this Country it is not of very constant use . You desir 'd me to send a sketch . but in my present condition I can not easily do it I can only say that I wish it not to have these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which I sketch 'd in my last . I should rather prefer a handle somthing like the other sketch , provided it does not require new patterns , which would increase expence . I should wish the handles to be rather odd than common . with respect to the ornaments on the Vase , I agree with you in rejecting all Imboss 'd chasing and would have them done in Silversmith 's Engraving . It should have on the sides an Oval for a Crest with Festoons of Flowers and Foliage hanging pretty deep . I think that the rim should have an neat bead struck on a fillet , and perhaps a narrow border in the stile of an antique frett or freize below it . I should like it rather Tall than broad with the handles rising a good deal above the brim . If it would not increase the Expence I should wish the Foot to terminate in a square plinth .

This opinion is founded on the nature of the Stone which has been the most successfully investigated by Scheele ? he found it to be soluble in small quantity in hot destilled water and that the Solution gave a red tinge to the Infusion of Litmus ?

Mrs. Watts account of Jessysl health appears to me sufficiently complete and I have no difficulty iu forming my opinion which is that medicines are only fit to palliate her complaint and give a temporary releif but were they to be continued for a long time without interruption they might do harm in place of good . They may be used however with advantage when she happens to be reduced to greater weakness than ordinary as she was in consequence of her attending the day School . And the medicines most likely to be usefull are bitters , bark , and the rust of Iron . But the means from which I would expect the most releif and amendment are proper exercise and attention to Diet In the greater number of cases similar to Jessys these Headachs proceed from disorder of the stomach in consequence of something haveing been  | eaten which disagrees with it or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich milk , fat meat , pye crust , acid or acescent substances , spices of different kinds and other things which tho easily digested by ordinary stomachs disagree however with particular constitutions . This disposition of the stomach to be disordered by such things proceeds therefore from a peculiarity of constitution and from weakness ; by strengthning the whole system the powers of the stomach are strengthned and it becomes less liable to such disorders but we can not hope to perform a compleat cure that will give security against a return . All that can be done is 1st To investigate by observation and afterwards avoid the foods etc. which disagree with the stomach and produce the headach and 2dly to strengthen the System ; The most effectual and safe method of strengthning the system is to be often in the air and to take proper exercise . The best exercise for this purpose is rideing , especially when the weather is not very cold , in cold weather walking may be preferred . The Cold Bath is also a powerfull means for strengthning the System when there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ramble which you propose can not miss to produce good effects on the whole company .

I will not attempt to use my arguments with you , further than that a restoration of your health would give much pleasure to all your friends , and that in your complaints this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend Dr. Withering has had many attacks of an inflammation in the Lungs , with Symptoms very similar to yours , he has hitherto been able to cure himself , and if you  | thought proper to state your case to him , I am sure that from his esteem for you he would give his opinion with pleasure My recommendation of Mr. Holbrooke was not so warm as it might have been if some circumstances relative to his marriage with Miss Wilkinson had been otherwise ; but he is a well informed sensible man and an agreable companion with whom I have formerly been in habits of some intimacy and I could not refuse him an introduction to you , though it is always against my conscience to trouble you with strangers . I find the metalisation of the earths is contested , but surely the proof is easy , if they disolve the reguli in mC and precipitate with an alkali , they should again have the earths they set out with .

These and other things together with the failure of my own headpiece , make business exceedingly irksome to me ; yet my health is much better than it has been , my headaches are less painful though more stupefying , so as frequently to render me unable to think . W removed about 2 months ago to a new house about half a mile from Mr. Boultons , which is pleasant and commodious , but has cost me much more money than I think I had a right to lay out in that way .

Edinburgh 1st December 1791 My dear Freind It is true that Dr. Hutton has been very ill and in great danger for some days , his Disorder was a suppression of urine which could not be releived by the Catheter or bougies , the bladder became much distended and very painfull and the urine began to be absorbed and to affect his head when we made a puncture and introduced a flexible pipe above the os pubis This gave him releif in the mean time ? and a few weeks after the natural Passage began to open again and is now restored nearly to its natural State , very little of the urine being now voided by the artificial Passage ? he was first/ taken ill in the beginning of August or not long after it , and the danger he was in , together with the uncomfortable Prospect that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was much weakened by it . he is now however a great deal better and in good spirits , he begins to sit up out of bed and to do a little business ? I exerted myself to get the better of the weakness which the above shock had brought on me by going often out in a chaise or on horseback when unfortunately in the beginning of September my horse fell and crushed my leg and foot  | so ill that I was feverish and got no refreshing sleep for some time after ? This weakened me again and made me very anxious about the consequences ? however by exerting myself and going out every day in a chaise as soon as I was able for it I recovered so far as to be able for lecturing when the time came ? and have been/ continued to lecture , I find it necessary however to keep at home , or go abroad only in a chair or carriage and am under the necessity of paying great attention to the warmness of my cloathing ? I mention this last that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birmingham gave us much distress when we heard of them we were under strong apprehensions for our freinds there and you in particular and it gives me pain to hear that the bad humour has not yet subsided ? you must surely take care hereafter to have a strong Body of the military within a small distance of the town . The artificial marble made here is made in the common way with Gypsum Lime and other materials and the artist who is an Italian calls himself a Scagliolist ( Scagliola being their name for Gypsum or works in Gypsum ) he imitates some of the opake and coloured marbles very well such as Siena and Brocatell and also the Porphyrys especially the deep red or purple ? but his white marble has no transparency whatever and is absolutely ugly ? one of the principal advantages of this art is the facility of imitating inlaid work in marble in which flowers festoons and foliages are represented , and which are extravagantly dear when executed in real marble ?

Edinburgh May 12 1793 My dear Sir Some weeks ago I took the liberty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hoped by this means to hear of you . But he is gone home again , and his letter to me from London has by some accident miscarried . In my letter to you I think I mentioned my intentions of coming to England , and my hopes of seeing you . But my Illness has been so distressing for these three months past that I have Sir Your most obedient Servant John Robison  | hardly ever been able to sit up for a day together , and I fear that I have little chance of such an amendment as will make it prudent to venture the Journey . I must therefore have recourse to the feeble Substitute of letters to obtain from the kindness of others what I am no longer able to do for myself . And I flatter myself that you will forgive this application to your friendship , knowing that nothing could induce me to it but the persuasion that I have some share in your Esteem and your good wishes . My eldest Son is just completing his 15th year , and I wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Chemistry , Mechanics , and other branches of natural Knowledge , makes him well inclined that way , and he has picked up a very considerable acquaintance with these things for his years . I should be happy to continue his academical Education much farther in this direction , but , unless he early begins to act , and to engage in the lower offices of the profession , his mind may get vain notions of Station , and may then feel some reluctance , if not disgust , in tasks which must be submitted to by a Youth who has nothing to trust to but his Education and his own hands . My Circumstances , with a family of five Children , and a precise income of L200 , put an Apprenticeship , where a handsome premium is given , quite out of the question , and I must try to find some Master , who will take my Child , and breed him , for his Services . I have Relations in Glasgow , thriving people in that line , but I have so bad an opinion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this of the coarsest kind ) that I wish rather to send him to Manchester , where , by all accounts , the Ideas of folks in Business are much more sober , the habits of industry more prevalent , and where Scotch vanity will not thwart my views by making my Son consider his first employments as degrading . I therefore intended going there with him this Summer , and try to find him a Master . But alas I am unacquainted with the way of getting a boy into business in general I wished to find one who would take him and set him first of all to work with his hands , and during this time I must board him ( if possible with his Master or some of his upper Servants ) . Then I hoped that he would be admitted into some department of trust , such as deliverer of yarn , or in short any thing above the mere work man ? As he continues to make himself useful I hoped that he might get into employment where writing and Accounts are required ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointments , which will contribute to the expence of his Education . While this goes on he must recommend himself to his Employers by his Fidelity his talents and his Assiduity , and form to himself such connections and acquaintances as may help to his engaging in business on his  | own account ? Such were my notions and expectations ? but alas they are all without book , and I am quite ignorant whether any thing like this be practicable . Should I go to Manchester with him , I am little better off-for I can not stir about , but am confined to my bed or a Couch for the far greatest part of the day . Before I can do any thing therefore , I must procure some acquaintance among the people of Business , such as are most likely to have use for a young lad to be so bred up for a confidential Servant , or who know such people . I know too well enough that a Boy totally unacquainted with the business is not a Servant but a burthen . You will now say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good Freind I wish for your help ? it strikes me that you must have connexions , acquaintances , and even influence , in Manchester . Perhaps you can recommend me to the Notice and Good Offices of some of your freinds who may inform me , advise me , and even assist me , and if you could venture to do this it would indeed be a great favour . I trust that you will sympathise with the anxiety of a Father , who for the first time , sends his Child from under his own Roof , and that you will not be inattentive to the pecularities of my Situation , rendered useless to my Family in the midst of my Life . Indeed my heart is very sore , to find myself a burthen where I shoud be a Support , and this at the precise time that my assistance is the most essential . My eldest Boy properly and successfully settled would be a prop and comfort to his Mother and a patron to his Brothers . I am sensible that I am asking a very serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this not without hesitation . But I by no means wish you to do a thing inconvenient for yourself . I can only say that my Boy has been soberly brought up , unaccustomed to any luxurious or even refind habits . Indeed he is innocent like a Child , and I hope his dispositions accord with his Education ? And I am not afraid that he will have any reluctance at any kind of work . I am apt myself to think him careless and lazy , but my acquaintances tell me I wrong him , and that he has done more than most boys of his years . I have endeavoured indeed to give him notions of cultivated manners . Perhaps this may be reckoned superfluous , and even inconvenient at the outset of his business . But I do not think him tainted with Scotch Vanity , the most hurtful of all casts of mind ? If I could procure him admittance into the family of a Freind , where he could have a sober and creditable Society at an hour of Leisure , it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misconduct , which he knows would forfeit his admission . I flatter myself that his gratitude will correspond with the favours he receives , for I know him to be a warm hearted affectionate  | Boy . But a parents partiality is always to be distrusted , and I am sensible that there will always be found about him failings which will require indulgence Tedious as I have already been , I must still request your patience . I am distracted by variety of advice . I am told that there is little chance of finding a Master who can make any use of a Boy quite green , and that he must get some preparation here . Mechanical knowledge is represented as a great recommendation . One advises me to send him for two or three years to a MillWright ? Another insists that he be bound for that time to a Clockmaker  --  these are precious years to be spent on a subordinate and an eventual part ofEducation , and I am loth to employ them in this Way . Another advice appears preferable ? To get him employd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get him particularly recommended to the Mechanical Overseer ? In any Office here he must learn the necessity of Obedience Activity and Fidelity ? and he will get much opportunity of indulging his favourite Relish in this complicated Machine , and I am cheifly apprehensive of his being too much drawn aside by this attention Any notions I have yet got of these Matters make me prefer the weaving to the spinning branch ? but my predilection is not great Thus have I told you all my Tale ? and have greatly fatigued your patience and entreat again your Excuse ? My aim on the whole is to obtain from you both information Advice and Assistance ? presupposing that you have numerous acquaintances among the Manufacturers , and can check me if you feel that I am going on improper grounds . I must go up myself ? and want introduction ? I cant have too many resources , and tho ' Peter Ewart is there and will do much for me , I am perfectly confident that the influence of Mr. Watts Recommendation will be great ? it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this , and yet even this does not convey a ten minutes conversation ? but if you give me Encouragement I will come and see you before I do any thing decisive . Allow me then my dear Sir to hope for a few lines from you , and be contented with the grateful tho ' barren and inefficient sentiments of my heart .

Doctor Black Birmingham May 15 1794 Dear Doctor I am extremely sorry to hear such bad tidings of poor Mr. Guyots ; health , who I was hopeful might have recovered under your care , as a Man of nice discernment and exemplary rectitude and a most sincere friend I shall lament his loss , with true concern . In respect to what he owes B and W we give ourselves no concern , and hope he will not in his present state waste thought upon it . I beg to be affectionately remembred to him . I shall write to him in a day or two , would have done so now , but am myself some what deranged from the effects of a yesterdays headach Jessy is still in a very weak and relaxed state , and has been for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time extremely violent , but have become less so either from the influence of the season , or from the use of the common palliatives , of which tincture of Castor and Laudanum mixed , and the tinctura fuliginis have been the most useful .  | She still has a cough and expectoration , the latter of the common kind free from all symptoms of pus , and at sometimes when the expectoration is difficult she has pains in her chest and some tendency to inflamation , the remedy for which has been generally , an alkaline mixture I believe the volatile saline Julep with oyster shells Magnesia and some Sal tartari this seems to operate by allaying the febrile symptoms and attenuating the Mucus . The Myrrh Medicine , was only given when most free from febrile Symptoms , to restrain the ever copious expectoration , which it has generally effected , but has seldom been continued so long as io days together and always laid asside on any appearance of pain in the side . It is the only tonic medicine which has agreed with her , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feverish fits , especially after being exhausted by the Hysterics , they commonly go off of themselves , her great disease is weakness and want of appetite , which I think owing to a lurking fever , proceeding from or causing the affection of the lungs , We have very lately put an issue in her arm from it having had very good effects in some similar Cases , But we have the greatest hopes from air and exercise , and as soon as she can bear to travel one Stage a day , Mrs. W att sets out with her for the Coast of Hampshire , where Dr. Withering is to meet them and take the direction of her health . He has been at Lisbon during the winter , but has not found the same good effects from it that he did the preceding year , and a Hemoptoe warned him to fly from the approaching heats of that Climate . He will make some stay in Hampshire for the sake of the sea air and to avoid the fatigue of business here which he is no longer able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we expect an argument to take place on the special case next week , if the opinions of that Court are ag ains t us we shall proceed to take the opinion of the 12 Judges and ultimately to the House of Lords . In the mean time the Lord Chancellor has interdicted our antagonist from making more Engines and we expect will interdict the use of those that are made until the cause is finally decided . all this is however enormously expensive and we are kept in suspence and anxiety . Mr. Boultons health is tolerable , but would not be so without the use of the Alkaline water which he constantly uses and finds great relief from . It can not however obviate all the effects of his own want of attention , of unceasing care and the approaches of old age ?

My freind Hutton who was so hearty at that time was taken ill a few days after , with the same complaint that he had formerly so that an operation has been performed and he is at present confined to his bed ? free however from pain , and in a condition to amuse himself with his books and writings but much the better of the attentions of his freinds ? there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he did before ?  | You need not hesitate to draw for the money You lent to Guyot , he left the most distinct account of the state of his affairs and had particularly noted down the Sum you had lent him ? present my Compliments to Mrs. Watt Mr. Boulton and other freinds and beleive me always Dear Sir Yours affectionately Joseph Black 1 Sir William Forbes of Pitsligo ( 1739-1806 ) entered the firm of Coutts , bankers atEdinburgh in 1754 and soon became a partner changing the name to Forbes , Hunter and Co. , in 1773 .

Birmingham June 9th 1794 Dear Doctor Your 's of the 6th has found me in the hour of Grief My Amiable and lovely daughter expired on Friday morning after a long suffering , the fever she had when I wrote you last proved a hectic of the most violent kind , which perhaps we might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent hystericks . On perceiving a change in the expectorated matter I sent for Dr. Darwin , who gave little hopes but prescribed for the fever and other urgent symptoms , I then had Dr. Beddoes who attended her daily for a week , but also seemed to think the case desperate , She breathed fixt air from effervescing mixtures placed near her and some times inhaled it mixt with atmospheric , but without other apparent effect than its being grateful to her . The violence of her fever the hystericks and her great weakness prevented our trying the effect of other airs and of some active Medicines which were proposed . Yeast seemed to moderate very much the hot fit of the fever and I think she owed some ease ease/ to the use of it . It has a tendency to purge which is easily counteracted by absorbents or ipecacuanha The irritation to cough , sometimes convulsive , with the fever and a rapid pulse 120 to 130 , brought on a hemorrage in the lungs of which she  | expired in a few minutes if that circumstance had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of pain , but the disease was too far gone to admit of rational hopes of recovery . We have only the consolation to think that we did all to save her which was in our power , or the very able physicians we consulted could suggest as proper ? Though Dr. Withering is not returned home/ we had the benefit of his advice by frequent/ letters by which his opinions corresponded with those on the spot as to the mode of treatment . Her mothers sorrow is very great , but she bears it well as or better than could well be expected , nor has her own health suffered so much as I feared it would from her unremitting attentions to her child . The loss to us both is great and irreparable but we must submit , and pay the more attention to those we have left . We propose a Journey to reinstate our health as soon after the last sad offices are performed , as may be possible It adds much to our affliction to hear of Poor Guyots death and our friend Dr. Huttons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and beg you will present our affectionate condolence I hope you will pay that attention to your own health which your Judgement directs , and enjoy the benefit of the summer as much as possible ?

Birmingham August 31st 1794 Dr. Black My Dear Sir Mrs. Watt and myself are anxious to hear of your health and Doctor Hutton 's . Wereturned froma Jaunt into Wales about 3 weeks ago and I should have wrote to you sooner but had some hopes of hearing from you . Our Journey was rather agreable though the weather was far from being pleasant . We can not saywe gained much in point of health , but we were amused and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our infirmities or vexations can not amuse you I shall therefore send you all the philosophical news I have ? A person in Birmingham produces Volatile alkali ( as I am told ) from the vitriolic salts with earthy bases , by mixing them with charcoal dust , heating them red hot and blowing air over them ? Another person is said to have discovered a liquor which bleaches brown linen white in one minute and is prepared without either manganese or Sp.Sal. this Man keeps his process secret as he means to take a patent for it . At Doctor Beddoes sollicitation I have contrived an apparatus for easily preparing and collecting artificial airs for medicinal purposes which answers very well . It seemed to me that the inflammable air produced from charcoal and water was likely to be one of the most efficacious as being a solution of charcoal in inflammable air I found however upon trial that it possessed virtues which my reasoning a priori could not infer . One inspiration of it causes most violent vertigo , and when very pure the barely smelling it caused a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which he awakened without pain or uneasiness.1 Dr. B. has given it in a case of incipient Phlisis sic , which it cured A young man in confirmed Consumption has had two doses of it from me , which he says have been of much service to him , the pain in his side and D-yspnea having left him t Note in margin neither pure inflammable air nor pure fixt air produce these effects in any approach to this  | The effects of the vertigo upon him , however , alarmed me so much that I have sent him to Dr. B. ? The consequences or attendants on the vertigo are a quick weak pulse , which at last is almost suspended , great sense of cold and the person becomes cold to the touch . If continued too long apoplectic sleep would ensue , these symptoms soon go off and are suceeded by an agreable abatement of the Hectic heat . The safe dose is from 50 to 100 cubic Inches mixt with 12 times as much atmospheric air . The inspiration to be intermitted on the first appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too pungent to be smelled to , from red hot chalk by dropping water upon it . 4 Cubic feet from 24 oz of chalk Mrs. W.

Dol . Edinburgh 9th September 1794 My dear Freind It gave me much pleasure to learn that you and Mrs. Watt were somewhat releived by your jaunt and that you have been able to amuse yourself with philosophical contrivances and experiments Dr. Hutton still continues confined to his house and without any symptom as yet of his entire recovery , free from pain however and enjoying good spirits and amuseing himself with his own philosophical speculations and printing some of them ? As for myself I am tolerably well , only feeling the effects of age encreasing upon me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have begun to prepare a legible copy of my Lectures , but by interruptions and defect of activity and strength I proceed very slowly ? You have raised my curiosity by the mention of an apparatus of your contrivance ; Is any description of it to be published soon e  | I perceive you can throw water into it when the matter is red hot . The narcotic effects of the heavy inflammable air or carbonated hydrogen confirms me in the opinion I had of it in consequence of what happened to me at Glasgow when my Servant was thrown into a dangerous Stupor or apoplexy by it and I myself experienced , by being less/ exposed to the breathing of it , very violent headachs ? Dr. Goodwinl who made experiments on respiration here , would not be persuaded of it but alledged that all the bad airs not actually corrosive extinguished life not by any noxious quality but by filling the lungs to the exclusion of vital air . Is the production of volatile alkali , by the process you mention , a profitable manufacture ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning Coaks slowly with an addition of common Salt but I beleive this volatile Alkali/ was contained in the Coaks as all the Substances which yield volatile alkali by destillation afford charcoals which retain a part of the Volatile alkali in them , and it is only such charcoals that are fit for making prussian Alkali The new bleaching liquor is perhaps some preparation of the Sulphureous or volatile vitriolic acid , which is the only thing I know beside the oxygenated muriatic that has the bleaching power ? Does Mr. Keir still adhere to the doctrine of Phlogiston or has he abandoned it ; Dr. Hutton still defends it in his own way and is printing about it . he desires me to return you his thanks and best wishes for your kind remembrance of him but was disappointed by haveing no news of the termination of your Lawsuit in your favour , it would be an high gratification to both of us ?

Our late friend John Wilkinson has also taken this opportunity to turn against us , He has got into a lawsuit with his only Brother , l and accuses us of having combined with the latter against him , but we think this only a pretence , at least we have cleared up all he could alledge against us in that line , There is one comfort that he can not do us much more injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no philosophical news of my own , having not been well enough to attend to experiments lately ; but the Pneumatick Medecine seems to have been of service in several cases which have come to my knowledge and there are/ several intelligent practitioners at work upon it in different places , so that there is reason to hope that the Efficacy and general powers of these medicines will soon be known Dr. Beddoes is publishing a new Edition of his Considerations with emendations new Experiments on Animals and Cases sent him from various practitioners ?

Heathfield Birmingham January 7th 1796 Doctor Black My dear Friend Your letter of the 4th gives me great pleasure from the accounts it brings of your better health which I pray may long continue , and that you may enjoy many happy returns of the new year ? When I was with you I was unwell , but gradualy grew better upon the road , not withstanding very indifferent weather , and since I got home have been much stouter and on the whole better than I have been these two last years , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though I have not been quite free from complaints lately , such as pretty severe  | headaches and a return of the spasms in my breast and stomach , which I now think proceed principaly from the latter as I have neither cough nor fever of any kind . The asthmatic complaint I have been very free from , at present quite so , except a very little upon lying down in bed I have however been obliged to adopt a direct contrary regimen to yours viz. to eat no vegetables except bread but I have a good appetite and good digestion of animal food ? As to the mental diseases I in great measure practise your counsel , and do not fall into the despondencies I used to do , and our affairs in general go on prosperously . Chancery seems disposed to do us justice on some of our pirates , but it is long winded . My son and Mr. Bs continue to apply to business , with the eagerness incident to well disposed young men I wish most sincerely you could have sent me better tidings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneasiness . I wrote to him , I think , two Geological letters since I returned I hope he has received them and a small box of fossils I sent him , beg of him however not to answer them except when it can give him pleasure I hoped before now to have sent you the portable apparatus , but it was long before I could get one finished and only one could be made until I was sure it was right ( for I am now a terrible sceptic in new things ) The trying it in various ways has taken me some time but it answers completely and more are making the first of which shall be yours ? I have made some discoveries ? I believe I now know the giddy making principle in Hydro Carbonate and believe it is not the charcoal New fire tubes make stinking air , I imputed that to the Sulphur or plumbago of the Iron ? to destroy that I filled a new fire tube with caustic Slackied sic lime and kept it 2 hours redhot , obtained some inflammable air ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelt like phosphorus or red hot Steel ? A quart mixt with 20 of Common Air was inhaled by a healthy young man , without any sensible effect whatever , another quart was taken by another person with as little effect ? The thing a wanting seemed to be the sulphur ? Borings of cast Iron were mixed with the charcoal , the air smelt stronger but did not stink , In smelling to it I got a little ofit/ , a very little , had slight and very transitory vertigo , which returned again rather more sensibly , on rising in the night , and was felt slightly next day I made some air from well burnt coals , smellt some what like soot and some what hepatick , vertiginous properties not tryed but not doubtful , was very inflammable ? The only doubt as to the sulphurated Hydrogene being the active part , arises from the charcoal , having  | been frequently used before and thereby deprived of its bitumen or fixed oil , which I doubt not would produce similar effects to the sulphur , as all unburnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very stinking airs ? New charcoal well burred shall be tried when I can procure proper patients . In the mean time here is certainly a method to make Hydro Carbonate free from the vertiginous quality ? What will be its virtues remains to be tried To prepare it with certainty , in a prepared tube some lime may be mixed with the charcoal ? Oxygene frequently or generaly has bad smells and much fixed air which I have long attributed to the cast Iron tube ? a tube was prepared with lime , the manganese in coarse powder was mixed with lime ( about 4 in bulk ) The air was free from smell or nearly so , and contained exceedingly little fixed air . The fine powder of the manganese and the lime were of a light brown , the inside of the larger grains was darker , I sifted them out and mixed them with more lime and subjected them to a second heat , the only produce was a little inf lammab le air ? I thought there was more oxygene than usual from the manganese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in different parcels Now I mean to close my account by a mechanical Medicine for your complaint , At Dr. Beddoes instigation I have made contrived a machine which he has got made which he says he doubts not will cure hecticks and intermittents ? I call it the rotative couch , a couch or Cott is suspended in a frame which turns round faster or slower as wanted upon a pivot placed under the centre of the patients body , but I think would be still better under the heart . Healthy persons placed on its experience experience sic a glow ( I suppose in the feet ) ' a phtisical sic patient sleeps better on it ( when turned slowly ) than in bed the hot fit of the Hectic has been prevented by it , and other favourable effects produced ? Beddoes is also trying the inhalation of powders in pthisical cases ( yellow bark , flor zin etc. ) he thinks with good effect ; they do not excite cough if used moderately I thank you for your prescription which I shall use when I become more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ever since I left Glasgow ) which I think has been of service Mrs. W.

I hope it will come safe and please . I think it all pretty well except some tin tubes , which are very vilely executed , but will answer the end and are easily replaced if they should not by some of your excellent tinmen . I have been making no new experiments lately , but have had an opportunity of seeing the effects of Hydrocarbonate in Hemoptoe , in a man about 40 , the disease was brought on by drunkenness , he spit blood to the ammount of a tea cup full in a night , in 3 days spit stinking pus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was blistered and got squill pills , two days after that I heard he was in bed with fever .

The H.0 given in the hemoptoe was made by mixing cast Iron boreings with the charcoal and was potently vertiginifactive , I am going to try whether much Iron is not suspended or dissolved in the air .

HeathfieldBirmingham October i ith 1796 Proffessor Robinson Edinburgh Dear Sir It is with much reluctance that I trouble you in the business of this letter , but I flatter myself , that when you are informed of the motives , which urge me at present you will excuse me. ? Ever since the Engine business was supposed to be profitable , Boulton and Watt have been molested with pirates of the invention . Unwilling to involve themselves in Law suits and sensible of the precarious tenor of all exclusive privileges in this country , they defended themselves by other means or winked at aggressions which were not of great magnitude until about 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the powerful party which supported them , B and W found it necessary either to  | bring an action against them or meanly to succumb under the combination , they preferred the former and brought their action in the Common pleas , where they obtained an unqualified verdict from the Jury , but the Judge thought proper to reserve some law questions for the opinion of the Court , which after long delay and two solemn arguments was divided , two Judges being in favour of B and W and two against them . The cause therefore remains undecided , There being in such case no appeal . However the Chancellor upon the strength of the verdict , granted injunctions to prevent , a considerable number of the pirated Engines from being used . These operations were however very expensive and served more to keep the enemy at bay than to produce profits to us . Other pirates in different parts emboldened by the indecision of the Court of Common Pleas set us at defiance . We however obtained injunctions against them also most ofthem submitted and paid our demands ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a Manufactory of pirated Engines , held out and after several fruitless applications to Chancery at last obtained an order for a new trial which we must bring on next term and will probably be tried in the begginning of December next against which time we must collect all our forces . The proceedings in chancery have done this service that it has obliged our opponent to bring forward the greater part of his evidence , an abstract of which I shall send you , as well as the arguments of the Judges on the law points . You will see among other things that they alledge I was not the Inventor some say that certain parts were in use before and others that the whole was invented by Dr. Roebuck , with whom I was acquainted till some time after the invention . In short the objections are multifarious and to every point ; but the court held that it was sufficient if a skilful Mechanick acquainted with the Engines formerly in use could perform the invention from the specification it was good , though afterwards even that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your opinion on that general question , and also how far you know the method to be of my invention and not used or practised by others at that time . At the same time I hope you will favour us with your opinion of the answers to the particular philosophical or technical questions , say to the expedience or necessity of more particular description , which from the numerous modes in which the invention could be applied seemed to me at the time improper to be inserted as bounding the invention . I have put down my own thoughts upon the matter , copy of which I shall send you as soon as it can be made out I believe the fact I there affirm to be true , that in a few hours after the  | idea struck me of condensing in a seperate vessel , I had arranged the whole in my mind and in a few days , had a model at work , which though defective enough in mechanism was in point of principle and in effect equal any made since You know also I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following various devises before I hit upon this simple idea , and also the pains I was at in endeavouring to condense the steam by external condensation application/of cold water , to save the force necessary to draw the water out of the condenser , which at last I was obliged to give up , not from impracticability but expence Knowing the state of your health and your avocations I am afraid to ask you to appear as a witness upon the trial if your opinions should be favourable , I shall only say that such appearance could not fail to be of great service to us , from your character , your Station , your Science and your knowledge of the invention , and that B and W would not withhold any expence which could make your Journey agreable . If your health or other circumstances render this request improper I can not urge it . Feelings of the irksomeness of obligated reflection at our time of life have prevented me hitherto from troubling my friends in Scotland with this affair which has for years been a torment to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance of our sons we must give it up , though the Stake is very great I proposed to have come to Scotland this fall when I might have had the pleasure of a personal Conversation with you and other friends , but various matters of business have me delay till the weather has broke and deranged my feeble health so much that I am present confined to the house , by Asthma and other complaints , with a change of wind these may cure but my presence has become necessary here or in London to prepare for this highly disagreable business , in the best manner we can . So that even the cogent motive of fetching Mrs. W. from her attendance upon her father can not operate as it would in other circumstances Many things have of late years , and in this present year , have co-operated to depress my spirits and to lessen the enjoyment of life ; but age and repetitions of affliction have lessened the acuteness of my sensations or at least the duration of acute sensations . Some of the diseases of youth have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their place , and the activity of mind with the ardour of invention which served as stimuli to the corporeal powers have subsided . I might however still have some enjoyments if these pirates and law-suits would let my mind have rest  | i must break off this disagreable subject In my present state it would lead me too far and I should not forget that you are severely a fellow sufferer my last hobby horse has been experiments on the best means of producing factitious airs for Medicinal use and in some applications of them , which have been in many cases successful , in others they have failed , as all other medicines do . To myself they have been of no avail in any of my complaints Our friend Mr. P. Ewart proves a very worthy and ingenious man , to whom we are under many obligations especially to his zeal for our interest . He has at present formed , as we hope a valuable connection at Manchester where he is at present but is expected back soon With best wishes and respectful compliments to Mrs. Robison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectionately James Watt I request the favour of an answer as soon as convenient please turn over Here follows Watt 's letter to Robison of 24 October 1796 Letter 163 WATT TO ROBISON * B.R.L. Boulton and Watt Letter Books . Heathfield Birmingham Oct oher 24th 1996 Jno . Robison Esq Edinburgh My Dear Sir Yesterday , only , I received your kind letter of the isth . That I have not forgot you will appear from a letter I sent to you at Edinburgh , by Mr. William Withering which should be delivered at your house on Saturday last , to which I refer . I have been obliged to trouble many of my friends with these abominable law affairs but have hitherto , have only called those who lived near London , but now these scoundrels , -  | the Hornblowers and others have leagued against us we must call all who are willing to help us . The state of your health and your disposition in too many bad points resembling my own prevented me troubling you while it could be avoided . I could and would descant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and on many points of your letter which come home to my feelings , but I also labour under low spirits , and might by what I should say tend to depress yours . I shall therefore on this subject only advise you to think better of yourself , do more think less and indulge the Bagatelle In regard to your very cruel disorder , without I know more circumstances I can form no opinion . If it is an ulcer of any kind perhaps small doses of oxygene air and hydrocarbonate mixt might be of use as they have been in some bad cases of painful scrophula . Meanwhile be assured that you have never lost my good opinion , though from my pursuits and diseases I have not availed myself to your good will as I ought to have done . My path in life has been a Thorny one and even now though reasonably rich I am bowed down almost to the grave with cares of various kinds , to say nothing of half a dozen chronic diseases . In regard to happiness you have nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have Now let us to business , for as I set out for glasgow on Wednesday I have little time , my Journey and stay there must be hurried for I must be in London by the middle of November , if alive I propose if possible to see you in Edinburgh on my return You will see from the papers sent you the objections and consequently the proper answers , I propose to send you my own general reply for your government , as soon as copy can be made ? The point is to establish that I was the inventor that the invention was perfect as to the saving steam and fuel at the time of the patent 1769 , and that the specification is sufficient to enable a Mechanick understanding Newcomens Engine to have constructed one with these properties I did not invent this method piece meal but all at once in a few hours in 1765 I believe , The first step was the idea from the elastic nature of steam of condensing in a seperate vessel , 2d the getting out the water by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the pump would extract the water also 4th that grease might be used in place of water to keep the piston tight , 5th that Steam might be employed to press upon the piston in place of air 6 to keep the Cylinder warm . The next day I set about it . The boiler was ready , I took a large syringe of Tom Hamiltons 2 inches diarLneter and a foot long that was the Cylinder . I made two tin ends to it with a pipe to convey steam to  | both of them . I made a tin Condenser consisting of a pump about an inch diameter , and two small pipes about io inches long and diameter immersed in a small round cistron , which I still have . I placed the Cylinder inverted tied a weight to the piston rod , blew out the air and/ condensed water through the piston rod , which was hollow , and when I judged the Cylinder filled with steam , I drew up the piston of the pumps and the weight immediately followed , to my great Joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after I had contrived it , the other experiments you mention in the Encyclopaedia were afterwards when I was bewildering myself with mechanism foreign to the invention and above all perplexing myself with trying to condense without injection . My patent is not for mechanism but for saving steam and fuel and perfectly applicable to the Engines which then existed . As you know my mechanical improvements the fruits of 20 years labour have nothing to do in this question , they are not protected by the patent , the steam wheel did actualy work with effect , but was superseded by the present modes which are superior. ? You need not fear that it will be any breach of our blessed law to inform me of all you can bear evidence to , If I do not like any part of it I shall tell you and you may suppress it . Our law is not Justice nor the semblance of it , it is full of quirks which the witnesses must be aware of , otherwise they will injure the cause they mean to support , therefore they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not tell falsehoods though they may conceal noxious facts , not trenching upon the Justice of the cause , Judges and Juries see the witnesses in this light and in cases such as mine it is the opinions of the most respectable witnesses , which determine them , for the Jury should give their opinions verdict/ accordingly and the Judge his sentence unless there be some unfortunate law quibble beyond the reach of common sense which the judge reserves for the Court who have got over such prejudices , You will see that any evidence from Petersburgh must come too late , for this trial and besides the date you mention is after the patent and could avail nothing . I think Dr. Black may be able to assist your memory in some points , I have wrote to him ? A principal question is supposing you to remember things nearly as I have stated them and are satisfied of the sufficience of the specification , could you come to London about the end of November , if your evidence should be deemed essential , when we know more fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too great to ask , but if you think the journey Light injure your health or affect your own affairs , refuse us flatly , but give us such other assistance as you can .  | I would say much more but though the spirit is willing the flesh is weak . I would thank you for the very flattering things you say of me in the Encyclopedia but I can not find phrases In respect to the Hornblowers they are mere thieves which you could not know . The steam collar was mine and in use before their patent , one of them saw it , also the expansive mode of using steam , their engine would not work till they also stole the air pump and lastly the condenser also . After all they were immensely under par when compared with ours , and by dint of fair trials and computations we have made them be laid aside . They have however the impudence and malice of devil . I shall endeavour to recollect about the strings at an another time Hiatus At top of page letter concludes : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in an error about the bulk of expanded steam , it loses head and loses bulk in what ratios I know not but so as to frustrate in great measure the expansive schemes , the good effect they have they owe to the moisture in the Cylinder ? adieu god bless you with better health Yours affectionate friend J.

I see you have not received my splenetic Epistle from the Country and that all my fears were bugbears of my own raising .

If this did not put an end to my troubles , it would destroy my Class and my Credit ? for I am forced to tell you my worthy frcind that I am shabbily used by our honourable patrons ( I believe I said something of this in my last ) and they would not interpret in my favour my attempts to take a trip to London after being sick nine years .

If none of these ifs will do , is there not a way of the Chancery taking Evidence by Commission in Edin. burgh But this must be enormously expensive , and it is giving you too high notions of any thing I can do . If any written declaration of my opinion can be of Use , I could then ( not being limited by precise questions ) say much more in detail what I recollect of the train of your thoughts and the sufficiency of the specifications I only want your instruction in what manner to proceed as an honest man ?

It is supposed the trial will take place some day between the 5th and the loth December , but of this more fully when I can be better informed .

He bids me thank you for your excellent Memorial I am sorry to feel myself so much enfeebled in mind ( by the Use of Opium ) as well as in Body that I can not give much force to any thing that I have to say ? and as it is a trying situation , to be exposed to the round about tricks of a parcel of Counsellors habituated to Villainy and skilled in puzzling and entrapping , I am much afraid of being put out of temper . The mere facts that I recollect scorn all attacks of this kind , but Watt says that one Hately is ready to swear that Dr. Roebuck was the Inventor and acknowledged to be so in the Neighbourhood ? Now I recollect Innuendos to this purpose , and have heard Gentlemen of Rank in the Neighbourhood of Bo-Ness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cases of some of these , when they recanted , and of others who persisted ? I have even heard the doctor claim several subordinate parts of the Improvement , and even say that Watt did not understand what he was gropeing after , and could not go on without him . Should I be sworn to declare the whole truth I must tell such things ? and then my Conviction of Watts Claim will be called mere matter of opinion . This I am certain will provoke me ? I must have a Conversation with you , to learn the utmost extent of Roebucks Claims . They must be well known to you ? I think that he was not a complete convert to the theory of latent heat at the time I was at Kinneil , or at least did not understand it . For I remember his insisting that if the Condenser was made of a great number of pipes , to encrease the Surface , it was of no consequence how small the Cistern was , and that even hot water on the outside would serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity of a very copious Injection ( nor indeed of any , which was watts first notion also ) If this was the Case I should  | speak boldly ?

What you recollect might be connected with something which I knew and have forgotten Mr. Watt writes me too that he has recruited two excellentEvidences at Newcastle per Contra he has discovered two other Setts of pirates ? and has suffered much from the damp weather on his journey ? in so much that he is obliged to send his Son James to London in his place ?

Edd . Letter 170 ENCLOSURE : DRAFT ADVERTISEMENT B.R.L. Misc . Box 35 . Yesterday On Friday last/ the long depending important/ Cause Boulton and Watt against several persons infringers of their patent rights Messrs/ Hornblower and Maberley/ was heard in the Court of Common Pleas in Guild Hall before the Lord Chief Justice Eyre and a Special Jury , who determined it in favour of the plaintiffs by a general Verdict and/ . The present Action was brought against the Defendants/ brought against a Mr. Maberley and a Mr. Hornblower , for having erected Steam Engines with a seperate Condenser and other Apparatus of/ If the sole Invention of Mr. James Watt of Glasgow ,  | and for having thus infringed a the Plaintiffs patent/ granted him in 1769for a Method of lessening the Consumption of Steam and fuel in fire Engines . The Case was opened for the plaintiffs by Mr. Sergeant Adair in the most able Manner The defendants in the prior proceedings/ had denied the ir Infringment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not intitled to its protection , because the Invent ion or/ was not his , and who/ that to prove/ in his Specification enrolled in Chancery was not sufficient/ he had insidiously misled the public , and concealed essential parts of the invention , for that it was of no use , and contained no information which would could/ enable an Engineer to avail himself of the Invention . After/ Mr. Sergeant Adair had/ opend the Case for the plaintiffs in the most able Manner which he did very fully ! , stating with philosophical precision explaining/ the original principles of Steam Engines , giving the history of their gradual Improvement from the Engine invented by the Marquis of Worcester to that of Newcomen , who totally changed its Nature and manner of action , and then stating , with philosophical accuracy the defects of tha Newcomens Engine , defects founded on the water and proportion of steam , and with equal precision having/ described the Improvements mounted by Mr. Watt and his method of applying his principle to the Construction of a Steam Engine which should be free from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned to it in the patent , namely the great saving of steam and fuel . The Counsel for the defendants seeing the Jury so fully instructed in the Nature of the Subject , in a very early stage of the Cause/ departed from their first averments admitted the Originality and Usefulness of Mr. Watts Invention , and and/ admitted that their Clients /Defendants/ had adopted the Invention of Mr. Watt infringed it/ , and boldly rested all on the insufficiency of the their Defence on the Objections raised against/ the Specification and set the patent at defiance . The plaintiffs brought forward Mr. De Luc Dr. Herschel s/ a Body of the most respectable Evidence witnesses/ to prove the superabundancy of information sufficiency of/ in the Specification and it appeared that they had a great many others in Court ready to be called if it had been necessary/ This consisted of Gentlemen eminent for their physical knowledge , and the most reputable Engineers and even head Workmen , who all declared the Specification to be fully adequate to the communication of all the necessary instruction . This was opposed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or persons well acquainted with the erection and management of Newcomen 's Engine , who declared that they were not able from the most careful perusal of the Specification to erect an Engine which , like those of Boulton and Watt , should save Steam and fuel ? It would appear no very difficult matter to find a very large body of Men who could emit such a declaration with a very safe Conscience ? Yet , some of these , when conducted step by step by the examining Counsel , actually accomplished in succession all the things required for completing the Engine . And , so difficult was it to find a sufficient Number of persons who would acknowledge this inferiority of apprehension/ that three Evidences called by the defendants viz Professor H n r and Mr. gave evidence which was decidely for the plaintiffs . Mr. Sergeant le Blanc opened the Cause with no less dexterity for the defendants , and conducted his Argument with great Astuteness and perspicuity . Mr. Adair concluded his reply with congratulating this Country with possessing such a number of well instructed persons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Men of Genius that the defendants after having ransacked the Kingdom for Minds of an inferior Rank , seemed to have exhausted the Number , and by mistake/ had furnished the plaintiffs with three of their most powerful Evidences The Lord Chief Justice conducted the tryal with an impartiality and a complete knowledge of a very abstruse and difficult Subject , which does him infinite honour . His Charge to the Jury was equally conspicuous for perspicuity , instruction , and impartiality . The Jury without going out of Court , brought in gave/ a general Verdict for the Plaintiffs with one shilling damages And thus has the Patent Right of Boulton and Watt been defined and established by Law " a Method for saving Steam and fuel in Steam Engines " , applicable to any form , and which may therefore be evicted from any form into which the ingenuity ofpilfering pirates may introduce it Whoever looks around him and observes the numerous applications great number/ of these Engines which are employed in every quarter , not only for the purpose of draining Coal Mines where fuel is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even when fuel is extremely dear , can not but be pleased with seeing the ingenious Inventor fully protected by Law .

Dear Sir , Some person told Mrs. Robison that you had thoughts of printing the Tryal . In this Case I wish it may not be too late for me to settle a doubt in my own mind about the Person to whom Mr. Modell was explaining the reason of his Ejaculation . Both IEpinus2 and Dr. Kruse ( a Gentleman eminent in that Country for Steel Works and great Knowledge in Chemistry , Magnetism etc. ) were there that Evening , both singlely and together , and Kruse was very inquisitive about your discoveries , and was not unskilled ( thro ' my information ) in Dr. Blacks Theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that they were not both present at the time . For I have a sort of image in my mind of the Situation round the table , Model sitting by the Stove opposite to me and , Epinus at my left hand . I found him there . Kruse came in while we were chatting ? and behoved to be sitting on my right ( for it was a little Closet , in the rigour of winter ) there being no more room.iEpinus went away , and therefore had it been Kruse to whom it was explained , he would have been on my right . But in  | the recollection I have of the thing , I am certain that the person who looked at the papers along with me was on my left . If this be a circumstance of any Consequence , I could get it set to rights , for both are alive and I can easily write to them . If it be sufficient to say that Model , in order to explain the thing to a Gentleman present did so and so , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have overdone in the way of exertion . I naturally wished to have the pleasure of being the Cicerone to Mrs. Robison , and have raised the devil , not to be soon laid again . I regret this for nothing so much as the depriving me of the pleasure of chatting old stories with you . But I have always been so completely jaded before Night that I was fain to go into Dock . Excuse me then for taking this mode of writing some of my thoughts I wished to take this opportunity of meeting with you to communicate my Intention ( fleeting indeed ) of printing a work on the employment of the Civil Engineer Millwright etc. such as might be useful to the mere Workman , might incite some to a further scientific , but elementary , knowledge of their profession , and furnish the means for this proficiency , and might also enable the person possessed of a proper degree of mathematical preparation to prosecute the difficult and interesting Articles as far as I can conduct him . This I thought might be accomplished by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be intirely practical , containing no science , but only the results of scientific investigation , connected ( when I am able ) by some palpable reasoning . This should be accompanied by a set of Notes in which the Assertions in the Text are demonstrated in the plainest method that I can contrive so as to be really good Logic . This should be either accompanied by a second series of Notes , or have an appendix , containing the most complete discussion of every important and difficult Article . The Work should contain the principles of Mechanics , Hydrostatics , Hydraulics , and Pneumatics ? Strength of Materials ? Strains ? proper disposition of both ? Friction ? Resistance of Mediums ? of sand and of soft or ductile bodies Theory of Machines ? including both the theory of their operation and of their best construction ? The theory of their operation requires the minute discrimination of the modes of acting of the Natural Powers which may be imployd ? Althis sic in a way totally different from the usual treatises of mechanics ? these in my opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine doing work this equilibrium is destroyed in one sense , while it remains perfect in another sense , viz the Equilibrium between the force actually impelling and the resistance actually exerted  | This will require the constant application of what I consider as the greatest discovery of Newton , viz his 39th proposition of Book I " That if AC be the line ( straight or curve ) along which a body is impelled or opposed by any force whatever , and if AD , BE , CF , etc are the forces at the points A , B , C , then ABED , ACFD etc are the augmentations or diminutions made on the Squares of the Velocities . Then , let a ball , moving with any velocity whatever , pass thro a rampart whose thickness is AC , and which resists penetration in the points A , B , C , with forces as those ordinates , the whole diminution made in the square of the velocity will always be the same , viz ACFD ? You will easily see that this gives the answer to every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is the leading proposition in dynamics ? and you can form some Guess at the manner in which I should attempt to prosecute this Subject . Hydraulics must be traced from the same source , and will terminate ( in as far as relates to the motion of the fluid itself ) in a theorem similar to ? Briot's3 . To form a further judgement of my manner , you may look at the Articles Philosophy , Physics , Pumps , Resistance of Fluids , Rivers , Roofs , Rope making , Seamanship , Sound , Steam Engine , Strength of Materials , Stove , Steelyard , Telescope , Tides , Thunder , Trumpet ( Speaking ) Variation of the Cyclopedia Britannica . But in all this you must recollect that I came in at the Broadside of a Work already far advanced ? I had to carry on two or three things Connected only by a Letter of the Alphabet , at once , and must deliver them on a certain day .

Letter 172 BLACK TO WATT Written in an unknown hand , the same as that of Robison 's Memorial of the same date and numbered 6o ' . Dol. 1 Memorial by Dr. Black respecting Mr. Watt 's Invention of his Improvements on the SteamEngine etc . Written in 1796 . I became acquainted with Mr. James Watt in the year 1757 , or 1758 , at which time I was Professor of Medicine and Lecturer of Chemistry in the University of Glasgow . About that time , Mr. Watt came to settle in Glasgow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some of the corporations who considered him as an intruder on their privileges , the University protected him by giving him a shop within their precincts , and by conferring on him the title of Mathematical instrument maker to the University . I soon had occasion to employ him to make some things which I needed for my Experiments , and found him to be a young man possessing most uncommon talents for mechanical knowledge and practice , with an originality , readiness and copiousness of invention , which often surprised and delighted me in our frequent conversations together . I also very soon had many opportunities to know that the goodness of his heart was equal to the acuteness of his judgment and understanding , and I therefore contracted with him an intimate friendship , which has continued and increased ever since that time . I mention these circumstances only to shew how it happened that I was thoroughly acquainted with the  | progress of his inventions , and with the different objects that engaged his attention while I remained at Glasgow and in a great measure ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was employed by the Professor of Natural 2 Philosophy to examine and rectify a small workable model of a Steam Engine which was out of order . This turned a part of his thoughts and fertile invention , to the nature and improvement of Steam Engines , to the perfection of their Machinery , and to the different means by which their great consumption of fuel might be diminished . He soon acquired so much reputation for knowledge on this subject , that he was employed to plan and erect several Engines in different places , while at the same time he was frequently making new experiments to lessen the waste of heat from the external surface of the boiler and from that of the Cylinder . But after he had been thus employed a considerable time , he perceived that by far the greatest waste of heat proceeded from the waste of Steam in filling the cylinder with Steam . While the great cylinder is filled with steam for every stroke of the common engine , a great part of the steam thrown into it , is chilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this last is heated enough to qualify it for being filled with elastic vapour , or perfect steam ; he therefore perceived that by preventing this waste of steam , an incomparably greater saving of heat and fuel would be attained , than by any other contrivance . It was thus in the beginning of the year 1765 , that the fortunate thought occurred to him of condensing the steam by cold in a separate vessel , or apparatus , between which and the cylinder , a communication was to be opened for that purpose , every time the steam was to be condensed , whilethe cylinder itself might be preserved perpetually hot , no cold water or air being ever admitted into its cavity . 3 This capital improvement flashed on his mind at once , and filled him with rapture , and he immediately made an hasty trial of it which satisfied him of its value , employing for this purpose a large brass syringe which he borrowed from a friend . His mind became now/ very much employed in contriving the machinery by which this improvement might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a degree , that he thought he was ready to make an experiment on a large scale . But here he was stopped by the want of funds , and he found it necessary to associate himself with some person who had money and spirit for such an undertaking , and to participate with him the advantages which might be derived from this invention . He addressed himself to the late  | Doctor Roebuck , whose spirit for enterprise and improvement in arts , was very well known , and the Doctor accordingly received with Zeal the opportunity offered him . A small Engine was soon built in one of the offices of Kinneil house near Borrowstowness , where various trials were made and some difficulties surmounted , so as to give satisfaction I must add that I was as much upon a footing of intimate friendship with Doctor Roebuck , as with Mr. Watt . The Doctor too had no small degree of mechanical knowledge and ingenuity , and was well qualified to perceive and value the talents of Mr. Watt . He had also much experience of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was withal ardent and sanguine in the pursuit of his undertakings , and was therefore a fortunate associate for Mr. Watt . 4 Mr. Watt was a valetudinarian more or less ever since I knew him , and his mind was liable to be too much depressed by little cross accidents or by the necessity of a greater expence than he had foreseen ; whereas the Doctor was undaunted on such occasions , and roused Mr. Watt to disregard expence and to double his exertions until the difficulty was overcome . But Mr. Watt was the sole inventor of the capital improvement and contrivance above mentioned . I remember very well that it cost me some reasonings and conversations to inform the Doctor fully of the nature of Steam , of the great quantity of heat and fuel necessary to produce it , and of the importance therefore of preventing the waste ofit . While thus employed , Mr. Watts reputation for knowledge and skill in the engineering line , occasioned his having an offer made him to take the level and make the calculations for an intended Canal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This , and other business of the same kind , filled up the greater part of his time for several years , and produced interruptions and delays of his experiments with his new Engine . But in the year 1769 being now completely satisfied of the practicability of his invention , he got the Patent for it , and in due time gave in his specification . There was much consultation between him and his friends about the terms most proper for this Specification . It ended in general opinion among them that he should not attempt to describe the machinery of the Engine , but take his Patent for the above 5 new and most important invention , or improvement , of making an additional vessel or apparatus distinct from the great cylinder or from that part of it in which the great piston moves , in which additional vessel or apparatus alone the steam was to be condensed by Cold , in consequence of its being made to pass from the Cylinder into this Vessel . The reasons for this opinion are sufficiently obvious . The above invention is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
