WEATHERLY // Once found wanting , Weatherly has been revitalized inside and out since her unsuccessful campaign of 1958 . Her greatest single new asset is her helmsman , Bus Mosbacher ( SI , Sept. 10 ) . But even that smiling genius can not sail her singlehanded . He has handpicked a crew built around a nucleus of sailors who have been operating 12-meters together since 1958 . His strategic starts  --  the secret of match racing  --  and effective sail-handling are accomplished by 11 New Yorkers who have been polished to perfection by their skipper . Slender , soft-spoken Doug Mercer is Weatherly 's , main-sheet expert  --  despite , rather than because of , the fact that he is the owner 's son . Alert and meticulous , Mercer catches people before they make mistakes . The Matthews brothers , Don and Dick , who learned the trade on their father 's Vim in 1958 , complete an afterguard that is balanced by an impressive alliance of experience and talent . // Leo ( Buddy ) Bombard , at 135 pounds , is the smallest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are outweighed by Gretel 's crew by some 10 pounds each . ) By rights a midships tailer ( i.e. , the man who winds the wire sheets around a winch ) should be a behemoth , but Bombard , the little lion , who has the fastest hands in the business , substitutes speed for size . Husky Bob Welsh " is so eager he does your work before you can get to it . " Bizzy Monte-Sano , 21 , a Yale student who skis when he is n't sailing , is adjudged by experts as " a wonderful piece of boat equipment . " Besides being a top hand with a coffee grinder , Charlie Bertrand is one of two men in the world who know the secret formula of a highly popular Italian liqueur ( Galliano ) . He is also the ship 's hypochondriac . " We had a joke box of Lucky Pills to help Weatherly win in the trials , " says one of his crewmates . " Just sugar , but Charlie took them all . " And , of course , Weatherly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helmsman , Weatherly 's foredeck can match him with the world 's best spinnaker man . Barrel-chested Vic Romagna , who handled Weatherly 's , kites so deftly in the 1958 trials that he was graduated to Columbia for her defense of the cup , has served four years on the new defender . He selected Don Browning and Ned Hall to assist him in the bow . They have more than justified his confidence , although they have had only a single summer 's experience of 12-meter sailing . At 45 , Browning is the oldest crewman and , being self-employed , is making the greatest personal sacrifice . Ned , a Princeton senior , should be concentrating on his studies . Explains Romagna , the lucid , erudite philosopher , " We 're all willfully neglecting something . " But to Vic Romagna , as to most racing sailors , sailing is a compulsion  --  the bigger the race the more violent it gets . Wet , cold or tired , no crewman ever rests . " If you 're behind you have to catch up , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay there . " Weatherly intends to be ahead . // GRETEL // Skipper Jock Sturrock combines a deft hand at the helm with level-headed diplomacy . Cool and unhurried , he has quietly conciliated Gretel 's syndicate of owners , her zealous designer and untested crew . Beneath his sober tact and firm command lies a puckish humor that has made his ship a contradiction  --  it is both taut and happy . Australia 's best small-boat sailor , he has won the respect and confidence of his crew , being neither indulgent nor overbearing . His navigator , Terry Hammond , keeps one up on science with constant study and the newest equipment . Not one to trust luck , Terry reads books like How to Survive at Sea in his spare time . Brothers Trygve and Magnus Halvorsen were Gretel 's construction supervisors . Burly third-generation Australians , they furnish " Norwegian steam , " plus a generous amount of tender , loving care . One of the seven married men on board , 44-year-old Magnus has four children back in Australia . // Like Weatherly 's Doug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian cup committee , has overcome " family connection " by cheerful acceptance of hard work . His resilient wit lightens the midship 's brawnpower . Trevor Gowland , 30 , is Gretel 's " fix-it " man . Although all crew members watched Gretel grow from drawing board to launching , Trevor , as foreman of the construction yard , knows her most intimately . A brand-new bridegroom , he has given Gretel far more attention than his bride . " She 's going to give him away , " jokes one sympathetic crewman . Handsome Bob Thornton is the crew 's Adonis and , at 21 , the youngest . ( Gretel 's men average three years older than Weatherly 's . ) His rugged good looks are matched by the lean , unflagging power necessary to a winch pumper . But the title of strongest man goes to stocky Frank McNulty , a tightly knit mass of muscle who could " lift any Weatherly man with one hand  --  smiling . " // In gymnastic ability Mick York ranks second only to America 's famed Rod Stephens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functioning of headsail halyards , sheets and an intricate maze of spinnaker topping lifts and guys . Like all Gretel 's crewmen , his 12-meter experience dates back only to Vim 's arrival in Australia two and a half years ago . But he has developed the endurance and self-reliance of all Aussie sailors who spend a lifetime in long-distance ocean racing . Peter O'Donnell and Dick Sargeant , 23 and 26 , are cat-footed veterans of Australia 's blue-water classic , the Sydney-Hobart race . " We 're not experts , " admits Mick York , " but we get along together . " That they get along with Gretel is obvious to Bus Mosbacher , who notes in admiration , " Gretel 's fast  --  and that crew is fast . They handle her very well . " York adds , " We read Carleton Mitchell 's book Summer of the Twelves and thought they were a bunch of supermen  --  everyone a champion . But I think we 're better off with our hard-working fellows . The Americans are talkers  --  we 're doers. "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
