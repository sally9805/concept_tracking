In another vehement exchange , Representative Car Vinson , Democrat of Georgia who is chairman of the HOUSE Armed Services Committee failed to remove a limit that was placed on the amount of repair and conversion work that could he assigned to Navy vards . Business for Private Yards The controversial provision would give private shipyards at least 35 per cent of all such work on Navy ships . Mr. Vinson 's effort to delete it was defeated , 130 to 64 .

The study is now going on . The House military spending bill also provided for 700,000 men to be maintained in drillpay status by the Army National Guard and Reserves .
