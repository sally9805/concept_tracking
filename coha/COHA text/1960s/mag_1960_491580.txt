pleasant woodland beside the access ramp to a six-lane freeway . The topless towers of commerce , as yet , show no signs of crumbling . On the contrary , New York is going through the greatest office-building boom in its history . And in many other central cities , stout believers in downtown 's future are expressing their confidence by constructing many-storied edifices of steel and glass . At the same time , however , commercial enterprises by the hundreds are following the migrating families and the fleeing factories to the empty land beyond the city 's borders . It all adds up to the fact that , on balance , the cities are losing . Not , perhaps , in numbers yet , for as the young assistant to the vice president moves his family to the suburbs , a Negro farmer from Georgia , or a slim , dark Spanish-speaking man from Puerto Rico , moves his even larger household hopefully into the central city 's core . Thus the " inrnigration " roughly balances the outward flow , and the city actually registers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths . The loss , however , is in quality of citizenship . The man who might have matured into a position of civic leadership has gone , to be replaced by a citizen to whom , for a generation , the ways of the city will be alien and strange . The loss in manufacturing may not be reflected in an absolute loss in numbers of manufacturing firms . The tall loft building abandoned by the old , solid , well-founded industry that moved to a new plant in the country is quickly occupied by two or three small , young , struggling enterprises . Nor do the commercial houses move , bag and baggage . The downtown store remains  --  hut it is forced by the inexorable laws of economics to set up suburban branches where the nuclei of new towns are forming around the outlying shopping cenIC rs . This migration to sonic new and presumably happier place far beyond the city 's boundaries is accompanied by a movement of population within the city itself . From the downtown core , where the old slums sprawl , population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the rush to the suburbs . Real-estate speculators move in joyfully , and old single-family houses and flats  --  where one household once lived comfortably on a whole floor  --  are chopped up into little cubicles into which a half dozen families swarm . Thus another slum is born , and the " gray area " spreads , and the city grows a little dirtier , a little noisier , a little more crowded  --  and a little less the sort of place where people want to live . These shifts and eddies of the population tides are more dramatically reflected in the city 's purse than in its population figures . Tax values decline as manufacturing migrates and middle-income citizens move ; and the city 's revenue dwindles at the time its costs are rocketing upward , Expenditures for housing , for public health and sanitation , for welfare , police and fire protection , and for the added burdens on courts and jails soar as the quality of the citizenship declines . Slums take a disproportionate bite out of the tax dollar . When they spread over 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on municipal finance has estimated , they absorb nearly 46 per cent of the city 's revenue . It is one of the paradoxes of our time that most of the city troubles stem from our great prosperity and productiveness . The people who are leaving the city go because they can afford it . They can pay as much as a third down on a 516,000 house , and are confident they can comfortably carry the mortgage payments for twenty or thirty years . The new people coming in are coming because jobs are there  --  and if the job gives out , there are the welfare rolls , ag. hose minim um monthly payments seem like affluence to folk who have lived most of their lives on less . Thus the bigger and richer the city becomes , the more it begins to suffer  --  as one economist put it  --  from " boom-town dry rot at the core . " The result is that in the wealthiest country on earth the cities where that wealth is concentrated and where the brains that produced it are congregated are becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles than before . To many an optimistic forecaster this represents not a dying , but the first pangs of rebirth . Cities are civilization in motion , and every new metropolis rises on the bones of a city that has passed into history . The city of wood gave way to the city of brick , the city of brick to the city of stone and marble ; the city of stone today is being buried under the city of aluminum , glass and steel . Each , as its new form ossifies , becomes more firmly fixed , and change becomes more costly and more difficult . It has been said that the quickest , easiest and cheapest way to clear any big city so that it could be rebuilt anew would be to set of a hydrogen bomb above it . 70 Difficult as they are to bring about , the changes are coming , slowly in some cities , spectacularly its others . From Hoe-ton 's Back Ray to Washington 's water front , downtown is in transition , and a new pattern of urban development is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city dweller has know n before . The great city-shaping forges of the nineteenth century  --  the steam-powered factory and the railroad  --  were centripetal forces , drawing : ill things toward a central core . The " highest Rod best " hind use , as dictated by the economics of the time , was a gridiron of narrow streets along which massed buildings rose from every inch of space . That pattern no longer fits the needs of a new time . The industrial resolution , which created the old city as a close-packed mass around a port or a railhead , has entered a new phase . The great forces of twentieth-century technology  --  electric power , the car and truck and the broad highway  --  are centrifugal forces . inexorably drawing men and their enterprises away from the central core . The great magnet of the city has changed as polarity . Where once it attracted , it now repels ; and it is desperately striving to switch its inner currents to recapture that which it has lost . Men , of course , have been quarreling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romulus and Remus laid out the streets of Rome , and the controversy still rages . Today 's efforts arc particularly debatable , for the changes taking place are fundamental alterations in the city 's physical form . City planners , many of whom themsels es live in the suburbs , are aware that those who fled the city left in search of sun and air and light and quietness and open space . Now that it is almost too late . they are seeking to provide these amenities in the city of the future . They know also that travel to the city 's heart has become an almost unbearable chore  --  many a suburban housewife has not been downtown to shop since she moved out of town  --  and their efforts are bent toward speeding the now of central-city traffic . They seek to open up the city , to reduce its density , to make it a more pleasant place to work in , an easier place to move around in . Nobody can quarrel vs all their goals . Their means of reaching them do n't always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quite know how to use the tools of urban renewal which lie at hand . To the downtown merchants , cutting an expressway into or through a city 's heart may appear to be a tine thing . It makes his store more accessible . It also may pour so many cars into the old narrow web of downtown streets that his place of business becomes less accessible than ever . The answer , of course , is more parking garages near the point where the expressway empties its traffic load . But here , too , a point of diminishing returns can be quickly reached . Superhighways and garages are great devourers of space , and the city may soon find that if it tries to provide all the express routes and the parking the automobile demands , there is little room left for the city itself . Los Angeles , for example , is a typical city of the motor age . Ninety-five per cent of its citizens come downtown by car , and in its effort to serve the motorist , the city has buried 50 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35 per cent under parking lots and garages . This leaves only 15 per cent of the space available for offices , stores , theaters , churches  --  the reason for the people 's coming downtown in the first place . The fine hotels and theaters are scattered widely over the great sprawling city ; and Los Angeles , in the true sense , has no central core . 1 xpressways in other respects arc not an unmixed blessing . Unless . they are careful'y planned , they can divide a city into isolated fragments separated from one another as effectively as if the Grand Canyon lay between them , The traffic flow on outlying streets may change as soon as a new expressway opens , and many a quiet residential neighborhood has been suddenly downgraded in value as big trucks started rumbling through , en route to an access ramp leading to a new highway . Many a city , particularly those on the great tourist flyways and trade routes of the Eastern Seaboard . has found that fully a third of the traffic on its downtown streets did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motorist , or the trucker , was on his way to somewhere else . This suggested that a circumferential highway circling the city would take a great burden off the downtown streets . Acting on this theory , Boston happily supported the construction of Massachusetts Highway 128 , in the belief it would relieve congestion in the center of the city . The new route , circling sonic ten miles from the center of the city , did relieve congestion to some degree . It also relieved the city of some valuable resources . As the new road opened , 5129 , 000.000 worth of factories , go ing jobs to 19,000 people , sprang up in the fields and woods around its interchanges . The highway became , in the phrase of the chambers of commerce , the " Golden Boulevard of the Electronic Age " ; and the region as a whole gained in wealth . But Boston itself suffered a net loss of $8,000,000 in industries and 8500 jobs . Bedazzled by the promise of the expressway  --  and bewildered by the problems it creates  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , to solving the problems of its dying public-transportation systems . Public transport hit its peak in 1447 , when automobiles were still scarce . Outside of New ' York , Philadelphia and Chicago , it has been swiftly dying since that time . Since the war billions of dollars have gone into an indirect subsidy of the automobile in the form of highways , bridges and tunnels . Public transport , with declining revenues and rising costs , has had to make its own way as best it could , As a result , in an age that produced atomic power , the jet engine and technological break-throughs in a hundred fields , nobody has found any new and effective way of moving masses of people from one place to another . Mass transit is about as slow , crowded , inconvenient and uncomfortable as it ever was ; and in the case of the lines that run on rails , it suffers from the added handicap of no longer going where the people live . City planners , however , know  --  as San Francisco and Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system die , eventually must build it up again at fabulous cost , With all its faults , fast public transportation can still move live times as many people past a given point per hour as can the automobile ; and it creates no parking problem once they reach their destination . Here and there , therefore , certain tentative efforts are being made to keep mass-transport systems alive . Boston , tired of subsidizing the Old Colony Line 's commuter trains serving the South Shore , now plans to take over the line and replace the trains with fast electric cars . In Philadelphia and elsewhere , similar arrangements are being considered . And Chicago , as it builds new expressways , is running public-transportation lines down their center lanes . One of the aircraft companies , foreseeing the demise of the warplane in the missile age , is turning its attention to what may become the public carrier of the future  --  the 100-mile-anhour car traveling above the surface on a monorail . Though monorails have been running for many years in Japan and Germany . they have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difficulty in stabilizing them , for their rocking motion sometimes left the traveler rubber-legged and green with motion sickness . This problem may now he solved by use of a steadying gyroscope which causes the car to ride smoothly and without sway . The gyroscopes also power the train . Sct spinning at the take-off point , they generate their own electricity between stops . Though planners , in moments of fantasy , dream of aerial-transport systems in which the huge helicopter buses or vertical-lift airplanes drop citizens down on rooftop landing Fields , the monorail seems to be a more promising system for the immediate future . One virtue is its cheapness . Traveling above the ground , it requires for surface right-of-way only sixteen square feet of space every fifty to 100 feet , for the base of its supporting columns . It would cost only $1,000,000 a mile to build , as compared to $6,000,000 per mile for freeways , and $25,000,000 to 530,000,000 for subways ; and it probably could be constructed above the center lines of many existing freeways . Equally as frustrating as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-range problems of how to house its people . Back in the ' 30 's , when the first public-housing projects began to replace the old slums , the sociologists foresaw the dawn of a new and happier day . If slum dwellers were provided with clean and well-kept , loss-rent housing , it was assumed that they would automatically become healthier and cleaner in their personal habits , more sober and law-abiding and ambitious . 11 did not always work out that way . The children probably benefited , but many of the older folk remained about as troublesome and unambitious as before . Even if they tried to show some pride in their new homes by building a flower box or painting a wall a brighter color , union regulations in some cities forbade their doing so . The housing laws themselves served to kill ambition . In the early class a family income of $1500 a year or less entitled a family to public housing . If income rose above that figure , the family had to move ; and all that was available was higher-cost private housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a householder held onto a low-paying job rather than take a better one that would force him to leave the " project . " The limit of earning has been raised to a medium of $3625 ; but that figure is unrealistic today , for the family earning $3600 today is no better off . because of inflation , than the family with an income of $1500 during the depression years . Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on public housing in the battle against the slums , and billions more are being spent . So far it has been a losing battle . Slums have procreated faster than they have been torn down , and this rimeess is still going on . This unhappy or cumstance is in part due to the economic laws governing city real estate , partly due to the outmoded housing laws themsehes and partly a result of the public 's attitude toward subsidized housing . Taxpayers in general are in favor of slum clearance . but the majority of them are strongly opposed to public housing as it has been carried out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs being what they are , it would be cheaper for a city to build a 512,003 suburban house for each of its low-income families and give it to them outright than to build a " project " for them at a cost of some 513,000 per family unit . Also , the urban-renewal laws , as written , rewate some of the city 's least savory citizens  --  the owners of slum property . The cat ' buys up slum areas , clears them and sell ) them to private developers at a ' oriel price . The Federal Government picks up the tub for two thirds of the difference between what the city paid for the hind and the price it received . The city pays the other third . The beneficiaries of this system are the slum owner and the speculative developer . Downtown really prices being what they are , the developer can rarely afford to till the old slum area with low-cost or even medium-cost housing . He builds high-priced apartments for wealthy tenants . This helps the city tax-wise , but it does nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the middle-income citizen , who finds that he can get better housing for less money by moving into a new subdivision outside the city . where attempts have been made to keep the middle-income resident in the city by building apartments he could afford , the results have not been entirely happy . Federal housing laws require more open space and parking space , the planners say , than is actually necessary . Thus the buildings are forced higher , and the open space not needed for parking too often takes the form of sterile green malls , where stern signs warn , KEEP Ors THE Glass . It makes a pretty sight from the air  --  the great blocks of apartments standing around the green open space , framed in a jeweled setting of many-colored automobiles . But men live on the ground , and high-rise apartments do not appeal to families with children ; nor is a mall where no children may romp or old men dream in the sun the kind of open space they are seeking . " A little yard where his kids can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big as a football field , " one planner said . Despite these disadvantages , there is at the moment a fantastic boom in apartment building , made possible by the heavy crop of newly-marrieds  --  both of whom may be working at good salaries  --  and by the growing number of older folks whose children have grown up . Thus the city basically still is building for the rich , the poor and the childless . The middle-income families , the backbone of its citizenry , continue to leave . Old " good " neighborhoods , where big houses sit in ample yards , might hold many a family in town , if they could be protected against decay . But FHA regulations do not encourage the renovation of old houses , and mortgage institutions are equally wary of financing " fix-up " projects in what may prove to be a dying neighborhood . In a few cities , of course , there have been some notable restorations . The fine old houses in Washington 's colonial Georgetown had long been slums when the renovators moved in . Now they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columnists . The old brick houses on Beacon Hill , once the habitat of proper Bostonians , have been restored , and Philadelphia is re-creating the fine residential character that " Society Hill , " near Independence Hall , enjoyed in the 1800 's . But these restorations of the beauty and dignity of downtown are rare . Baltimore , in a bold experiment , is clearing out the centers of residential blocks in areas that are beginning to decline . Back of the houses , they are building green areas which all the residents can enjoy and " tot lots " where the little folk can play . By such means they hope the owners of surrounding residences will fix up their houses and save them from decay . Though frustrated by apathy , selfishness , divided counsel and artificial debt limitations imposed by hostile legislatures controlled by men of rural background who instinctively view the city as an evil place , the big towns are finally beginning to fight back . Merchants , through " park and shop " plans , are luring many emigr ( fs buck downtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , parks are being built , recreation areas provided . In Toledo and Kalamazoo the mall idea is being tested , giving the heart of downtown back to the pedestrian . To share in Federal funds , each city now must have a renewal plan ; and most have professional planners  --  though in many cities still , the planner 's rank in the municipal hierarchy is about equal to that of the night man at the sewage plant . Each city has similar problems . Each is attacking them , hesitantly or vigorously , as its civic personality dictates . Boston , the smallest of the great central cities , is perhaps the sickest of them all . Surrounded by hostile suburbs whose rallying cry is " To hell with Boston , " it is burdened , the students of Megalopolis say , by the poorest housing , the greatest welfare needs , the highest tax rate and a municipal government which . since the time of Mayor Curley , has looked upon the public payroll , as one proper Bostonian put it , " merely as a teat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a civic schizophrenia which other cities have managed to escape . The old " white birch Yankees " still own downtown , though they no longer live there . The Italians and the Irish of the Last Hurrah clans run its politics . Both groups view each other with supreme distaste , and there is little communication between them . Also , in Boston there is no one man , or family , or any single group of men of wealth and wisdom who feel that they are stewards of the city and responsible for its destiny , as the Mellons feel about Pittsburgh , or the Rockefellers about New York . There are many good division commanders in the Greater Boston Economic Survey Committee , but no top general or general staff . Also , the GBESC so far is a research group , with no power to act . A somewhat similar situation prevails in Philadelphia , where no single leader or civic group bears the brunt of the battle for urban renewal . There , though , many dedicated individuals and organizations arc attacking vigorously on many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is different . Throughout the administrations of Mayors Clark and Dilworth , 1hc businessmen , academic people and civic groups interested in the rebirth of the city have had free entree to city hall . Politicians and lay citizens work together with reasonable amiability , and their ideas are co-ordinated by a topflight planning staff . The happy result has been that Philadelphia has done more perhaps , than any other city to mccl Ihc challenge of the times . Its achievements have been less dramatic than Pittsburgh 's spectacular Golden Triangle renewal , but in variety and scope they lead the country . No city of the Eastern Seaboard has seemed quite so determined to save itself from blight ; though New Haven , spurred by a hard-driving young mayor , a Yale graduate named Richard Lee , now is beginning to move with equal vigor . Baltimore , the pioneer in city planning , lagged in its zeal for a while . Now it is back in the battle with great renewal projects planned which will cost nearly 51,000,000,000 over the next twenty years , In New York the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave their city 's destiny in the hands of Mr. Moses , the Port of New York Authority and whatever mayor happens to be sitting in City Hall . This confidence has not been misplaced . Mr , Moses has built bridges and expressways with great zeal , and Mayor Wagner has recently proposed a hugely expanded program which in the next fifteen years should practically wipe out the city 's 7000 acres of slums in which its juveniie gangs are spawnei Washington , handicapped by lack of local self-government and the absence of powerful business and financial leadership , has been one of the nation 's most helpless victims of urban sprawl . The first stop on the great migration route from the South , it has seen its white population flee to the bedroom towns of Maryland and Virginia while its colored population rose to 52 per cent . Now , with a strong planning commission at work , the city has begun to attack its slums . Plans for the rehabilitation of the shabby water front are under way , and there is talk of a subway under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole transporta tion system , With 53 per cent of its land Government-owned or otherwise tax exempt , Washington , the economists say , can no longer afford to remain merely the seat of government , Without destroying its dignity as the nation 's capital or its quality as a shrine to which 6,000,000 visitors come each year , it can and must become a great distribution point and a center of light industry . From Washington to Boston the same two questions face every city  --  how to slow down the flight to the suburbs and how to stop the decay of the downtown core . To Mr. Victor Gruen of New York , the noted architect and planner , there is a fairly simple answer  --  impose upon the old layout of the city a new pattern that meets the needs of human beings . The first attack must be upon the choking traffic at the city 's core . Traffic , in Mr. Gruen 's view , is like a river system . But rivers empty into the boundless sea ; and expressways are great rivers emptying their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drown the city . Therefore , huge retention basins must be built just outside the city 's heart . The radial expressways would feed their traffic of transit buses and private cars into a circular boulevard drawn snugly around the downtown section . " The belt must be tight , " said Mr. Gruen , " or the city will lose its pants . " Along this boulevard huge transit terminals and parking garages would poke like fingers into the downtown core their exits only a few minutes ' walk from the center of the city . The center itself would be a pedestrian island , from which all wheeled traffic would be barred except small coin-operated electric carts for the use of the aged and infirm . The downtown streets would be converted into malls and walkways , bright with flowers and fountains , alive with color and movement . Thus , says Mr. Gruen , who has drawn up such a plan for the city of Fort Worth , downtown would become more efficient and attractive , more compact and convenient . With its offices , theaters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become again the great magnet . the central meeting place . The conversion of downtown into a pedestrian island would be only the first step in the over-all reshaping of the city , Radial expressways , and circular highways cutting across them , would separate industry from residential areas , create communities within the city and link the communities not only to downtown but to one another . Beyond the towers of downtown , in what is now the " gray area " of spreading blight , the garden apartments would rise . Here high- and low-rise structures would be mixed together in massive groupings , separated from one another by belts of green and usable open spaces , attractive not only to the single folk , widows , divorcees and childless couples who are the natural inhabitants of cities , but to families as well . This , the planners and thinkers say . is the city of the future . organized in cells and clusters with some sense of unity and order and balance , stretching away to the horizon to meet the chaotic and disordered sprawl of suburbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the metropolis , the planners say , can not forever survive divided against itself . Some new form of government , greater than the city , less than the state , must be evolved to link city and hostile suburbs together to their mutual benefit . Next week some ideas of how this may be brought about  --  and the stolent objections to them  --  will be discussed .
