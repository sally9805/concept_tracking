The U.S. last week sketched the details of what it hopes will be the world 's first supersonic commercial transport . Federal Aviation Administrator Najeeb Halaby , asked by the Kennedy Administration to investigate the feasibility of such a plane , spelled out the desired quality of what he called " the monster . " The new plane should cruise at Mach 3 ( about 2,000 m.p.h. ) at an altitude of 65,000 to 75,000 feet , fly from Los Angeles to New York in 74 minutes , and zip across the North Atlantic in less than two hours . <P> Target date for the Mach 35 to enter passenger service : 1970 . <P> Though five big U.S. planemakers have already turned out their own preliminary designs of Mach 3 commercial jetliners ( see cut ) , development costs , estimated as high as $500 million , have scared them off . Under the new system , the Government and planemakers will decide on one design for the Mach 3 ; the Government will then let contracts to one or more planemakers and share the burden of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $12 million to get the program started , and the Government may recoup at least a part of its investment by collecting a royalty on each plane . Planemakers estimate that the new craft will sell to the airlines for from $12 million to $25 million , depending on the number of manufacturers involved . ( A Boeing 707 costs $6.1 million . ) <P> Aeronautical experts expect about 150 Mach 3 jetliners to be in service by 1975 . The planes will carry 100 to 130 passengers , have a crew of six , and be able to land and take off from most runways now used by subsonic jets . Except for tough , heat-resistant windshields in the cockpit , they will be windowless to give the fuselage greater strength . The passengers will see the outside by television .
