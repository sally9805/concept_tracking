 | THUS WITH A dreadful abruptness it becomes necessary once again f , for the nation and the world to experience the death of an American President . It is occurring too often in this hectic age : the nation is becoming traumatic . The world , which secretly or openly always enjoys the discomfitures of its most powerful , most patient and most confused member , responds as might be expected . In London ( " We Have Lost a Good Friend " ) , in Paris ( " A Curious Figure Passes from the Scene " ) and in Moscow ( " H. Hudson , American Politician , Dies " ) the reactions are at least reasonably respectful . But in Asia , Africa and some parts of Latin America , the chorus of jubilation mounts . From India 's " President Hudson Dies in Midst of Questionable Overseas Adventures " to Dar-es-Salam 's " Invader of Africa Cut Down , " to Cairo 's " American Assassin Gets Deserts , " to Cuba 's " World Breathes Thanks as U.S. Criminal Killed , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours in which the fantastic news races the globe , the response is one of immediate emotion , for the moment only . It will be a while before the ultimate implications sink in . Not so , of course , in Harley Hudson 's native land , where a President need do no more than suffer a slight head cold to start the speculations whirling . Confronted by actual death in the White House , those whose profession it is to assess implications and consequences go at once to work . Everyone who has access to newsprint , editorial , magazine or television tube is instantly a-cackle . This time the implications and consequences are not only enormous : they are without precedent . Never before has a Presidential candidate died before an election . The fact that Harley is actually gone , as Senate Majority Leader Bob Munson of Michigan remarks bitterly to his wife Dolly when he calls her at " Maine Chance " immediately after hearing the news , is almost forgotten in the rush of conjecture about What Will Happen Now . Some are like Helen-Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Washington Evening Star , whose instinctive , startled reaction in the San Francisco Hilton 's press room ? " If Orrin Knox does n't have all the luck ! " ? is immediately succeeded by a shame-faced , sad and genuine , " Poor Harley , poor Harley ! " There are others , like her ex-husband Walter Dobius , who waste no time on such  | sentimental maunderings but plunge at once into the analysis , and creation , of the news . " The place of Harley M. Hudson in the sometimes sorry story of America in these troubled times , " Walter types swiftly now in his hotel room ( be has avoided the press room since he and Helen-Anne had their savagely bitter and by now quite historic shouting match there , forty-eight hours ago ) will have to remain for history to decide . " As the man who , in the weeks just past , deliberately and some think quite irresponsibly plunged the United States into simultaneous wars in Gorotoland and Panama  --  as the man who in pursuit of those irresponsible purposes ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have much to answer for . " Personally , he was a likable and rather inoffensive individual , tossed to the top by one of those strange quirks that all too often decide the course of American government . " Politically he was , in the opinion of many , a disaster . " But he is gone now , and even before he is decently buried , the clamor begins : What will happen now ? Will some back-door deal be worked out by which Secretary of State Orrin Knox , the man who bears equal responsibility with the late President for America 's recent disastrous course in world affairs , automatically succeed to the position at the head of the ticket for which many believe him neither qualified nor entitled ? " Or will the great convention which is just dispersing here in San Francisco be immediately reassembled  --  such recall is in the power of the National Committee  --  to choose a new nominee for President ? And will California 's Governor Edward M. Jason , humiliated and put down by President Hudson and Secretary Knox  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegates had they been free to select him  --  have the second chance which in all justice and by all standards of common fairness is rightly his ? " This , quite obviously , is what Walter and Walter 's world most desperately desire , and already from the small but powerful group of columnists , commentators and publications who see things as he does , the suave suggestions are coming forth in these first stunned hours : The convention must be reassembled . Ted Jason must have another chance . There is no other way things can possibly happen . It is inevitable . But , as is so often the case with these deliberate attempts to convince the public which are so persistently launched by the tight-knit  | little consortium of top-flight talents whose opinions Walter sometimes forms and sometimes acts as spokesman for , the insistence that it is " inevitable " is of course quite untrue . It is what Walter 's world would like to rush the country into believing before anyone has time to think of an alternative , so that there will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the decision . But this does not make it true , nor does it , in this case , make it inevitable . Governor Jason 's supporters are aided powerfully now , as they have been throughout the convention and preconvention period , by many of the nation 's major commentators and publications . But whether they will triumph depends upon a number of astute and thoughtful individuals . Some of them are extraordinarily tough . Several , having weathered many storms and survived many battles , are quite immune to pressure . And some have nothing any more to lose . The widowed First Lady , for instance , who has just made the human mistake of breaking down in public and has thereby shadowed forever her place in legend , is such a one . Lucille Hudson is devastated by grief right now , but after the ceremonies and the pomp and circumstance are over , the shrewd brain that functions behind that fluffy pink-and-whiteness will begin to operate again : its conclusions will not be of assistance to Governor Jason . Senate Majority Leader Munson is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will not be deflected by press campaigns or any other pressures that may be brought against him . At this moment he is acutely aware that no one knows what will happen : the game can go in any direction . Acting alone , the fifty-three men and fifty-three women of the National Committee ( representing the fifty states , District of Columbia , Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands ) can select new nominees for President and Vice President . Or they can reconvene the convention and let the matter be fought out there . Whatever the procedure , there is the not-improbable chance that the new nominees , under these difficult conditions of strain and confusion , will not carry sufficient electoral votes in November to win a clear-cut victory . In which case , the matter will return to Capitol Hill to be decided by the House of Representatives , with no one knows what further strains and stresses on the fabric of American government and the strength and stability of America 's policies foreign and domestic . So there is much for Bob Munson to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important people around the country from the Cali-  | forma Zephyr as it climbs slowly through the Rockies on its way to Denver . And he is doing it without reference to the forces of public opinion already being massed against the outcome he would like to see ; although , being an old and very experienced hand at the game of national politics , he knows these forces can not be ignored . They must be met head on and conquered . For Orrin and Beth Knox in Carmel , California , this knowledge also is so immediate as to be virtually instinctive . Three times the Secretary of State has sought the Presidential nomination , and on this third try , after saying he would not accept second place  --  as so many people high in American politics say they wo n't do things , and then do  --  he has agreed to run with Harley in order to strengthen the policy of firmness toward Communist imperialism that they have believed best for the security of the republic and the peace of the world . Now , instantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these things I in a nation 's life , for there they are  --  Harley is gone and Orrin is left alone to stand for the cause they both believed in . For the first half hour or so , while Beth calls Lucille at " Maine Chance " and they weep together , he sits in Carmel and stares down at the rolling sea from the beautiful cliffside home on Spindrift Drive that Esme Harbellow Stryke , National Committeewoman from California , has given them to use for as long as they wish . Esme is an odd one , he thinks now , fighting him as bitterly as she did at the convention and then turning around and giving him the use of her summer home . He had n't known she had a conscience , but apparently she has : in her strained , embarrassed voice when she called the St. Francis Hotel and made the offer , he thought he detected an apologetic guilt for the terrible episode in which his daughter-in-law , Crystal Danta Knox , lost her baby after being pummeled in the fog outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was n't Esme 's fault , but she was nice enough to try to make amends . And now , he thinks with an ironic amusement , she is stuck with it , because as surely as that wave just smashing on the rocks will be succeeded by the next , Esme is going to be back fighting him the moment it becomes clear when and where the battle is to be joined . He is as certain of that as he is certain that he is going to have to meet Ted again for the Presidential nomination . Now that Harley is gone there is no question whatsoever in his mind that he must step up and take the nomination ; and he knows that Ted , for all his fiddling with a " Peace Party " is going to have exactly the same idea . " Peace Party ! " ... Orrin is willing to bet , with a grim little smile ,  | that at this moment the " Peace Party " meeting at the Hilton is being dismantled as swiftly as it was put together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious thing about it is that it is being done without any real communication between the " Peace Party 's " organizers and their assumptive candidate . The Governor of California is still incommunicado . No one has been able to reach him , and aside from the correct and formal statement which he has issued through his press secretary on hearing of the President 's death , he might as well not exist . Who really knows , at this frightful moment when the gagging crews at Andrews Air Force Base are still cleaning up what remains of Air Force One and trying to rake together enough human scraps to fill a Presidential coffin  --  at this moment when the nation is still stunned by the enormity of the catastrophe that has taken not only Harley Hudson but three Cabinet members , four members of Congress , three members of the diplomatic corps , six of the press corps ' ablest reporters and thirteen members of the general public  --  who knows what Governor Jason will do ? His wife Cell has left him , at least for the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent methods of some of his supporters at the convention . His ex-campaign manager , Robert A. Leffingwell , who still carries great influence with many of the nation 's liberals despite his recent defections from their cause , has gone over to the Hudson camp . The ruthlessness with which he has pursued the Presidential office has created an uneasy , insistent questioning in the minds of many of his countrymen . What will he do ? Many would like to know , but none has the word . Like Orrin Knox in Cannel , Ted is sitting in his Mark Hopkins Hotel room , thinking . Presently he picks up the telephone and calls the man whom Orrin has already tried to reach . But there is no answer for anyone in the room of Robert A. Leffingwell , and no one knows what he will do , either . True , he left Ted Jason to place Harley Hudson in nomination . But he has not said yet how he feels about Orrin Knox , who as Senator from Illinois led the successful Senate fight to defeat Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's loyalties yesterday lay with Harley , the man who rescued him from political oblivion after that defeat . Where do they lie now ? Two or three times again , from Carmel and from Sacramento the phone rings in Bob Leffingwell 's room . But the switchboard says he is accepting no calls , and the question remains : what will he do ? What will they all do , for that matter , all those whose hopes and ambitions , dreams and desires , went into the making of the wild ,  | chaotic convention just concluded ? Cullee Hamilton , Negro Congressman from California , candidate for Senator from California , steady and decent and no friend to Ted Jason . . . Roger P. Croy , former governor and now National Committeeman from Oregon , no friend to Orrin Knox . . . Patsy Jason Labaiya , sister of Ted , estranged wife of Felix . . . Senator Lafe Smith of Iowa , close friend of Orrin , Harley and Bob Munson . . . Rep. J. B. " Jawbone " Swarthman , chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hudson policies , as it has suited him . . . Supreme Court Justice Thomas Buckmaster Davis , sometime friend of Bob Leffingwell , all-time enemy of Orrin Knox . . . Senator Fred Van Ackerman of Wyoming , bitter enemy of Harley and Orrin , spokesman for the Committee on Making Further Offers for a Russian Truce ( COMFORT ) . . . LeGage Shelby , old friend and present enemy of Cullee Hamilton , national chairman of Defenders of Equality for You ( DEFY ) . . . Rufus Kleinfert , Knight Kommander of the Konference on Efforts to Encourage Patriotism ( KEEP ) . . . and all those in the world beyond , whose nations and peoples are so deeply affected by the occupant of the American Presidency , such men as the Secretary-General of the United Nations . . . Krishna Khaleel , Ambassador of India . . . Lord Claude Maudulayne , Ambassador of the United Kingdom . . . Raoul Barre , Ambassador of France . . . Vasily Tashikov , Ambassador of the U.S.S.R. . . . Prince Obi . . . Terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others who have so profound and basic a stake in the outcome . But most important of all , what will the President of the United States do ? Because there is one , of course , product of that American capability , built in by her founders and so annoying to those who would like to see her toppled , to maintain her national continuity even under so heavy a blow . Even now , at his sister 's vacation cabin at Lake Tahoe , the pragmatic old veteran who has been Speaker of the House for the past twenty years is being sworn in by a trembling young Forest Service ranger whom he has pressed into service for the occasion . " Mr. Speaker " at this moment is in process of becoming " Mr. President , " just as the Constitution says he must in the absence of a Vice President . Harley did n't have one , though he had the authority under the twenty-fourth Amendment to fill the vacancy created by his own accession to the White House . He had told the Speaker once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway , and meanwhile he did n't want to create all sorts of political hostilities in Congress by choosing one of them over another . This had disturbed the Speaker and caused much national concern ,  | but Harley was the President and the option was his . He did n't choose to exercise it , and so here is history being made at Lake Tahoe : Mr. Speaker is becoming Mr. President . " If you will repeat after me , sir ? " the young ranger says . The Speaker interrupts with a wave of the hand that starts out to be impatient but thinks better of it . " I 've attended a few , son , " he says , not unkindly . " I know how it 's done . " " Yes , sir , " the boy says , blushing , and begins , stammering slightly in his excitement , " I , William Abbott ? " " I , William Abbott , " the Speaker repeats gravely , and everything is silent save for the click and whirr of cameras and the nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose argument will go down in history on the tapes and films of this historic event . " ? do solemnly swear , " the young ranger goes on , and the Speaker 's voice grows a little stronger , though on his sister 's worn Bible his right hand trembles ever so slightly " ? do solemnly swear ? " " ? that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States ? " " ? that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States ? " " ? and will to the best of my ability ? " " ? and will to the best of my ability ? " " ? preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " " Preserve , " the Speaker says , his voice falling suddenly to a soft , grave , deeply determined note , " protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " " Mr. President ! " a cameraman shouts , and with a little smile he turns and faces the clicking , whirring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their weathered faces blink into the lights a little uncertainly , plain , simple , unaffected , as if , for a second , beseeching the support and understanding of the world . Behind and below them , over the porch railing , the beautiful lake can be seen , stretching far away in the gathering darkness to the distant lights against the distant mountains on the farther shore . Quite by accident , by no one 's design but simply because the Speaker happens to have been there when he got the news , a curiously bucolic air is lent the occasion . For just a second something subconscious , almost visceral , touches the hearts of his watching countrymen  --  something harking far back into the innocence of an earlier America , this  | swearing-in of the new President of the United States in a simple log cabin , in a forest , by a lake . As if the actual ceremony has released them all , within the hour a few answers begin to be given to some of the questions of what-willthey-do . The first headlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COMMISSION TO PROBE HUDSON CRASH . MAY SUMMON NATIONAL COMMITTEE IMMEDIATELY AFTER FUNERAL TO CHOOSE NEW NOMINEES . They are followed quickly by : PRESSURE MOUNTS FOR RECALL OF CONVENTION . And shortly thereafter : SECRETARY KNOX ANNOUNCES , " I EXPECT TO HEAD THE TICKET . " And moments later : GOVERNOR JASON REPUDIATES THIRD PARTY , PLEDGES FIGHT FOR TOP SPOT . It appears that the tale as before is about to be retold . But there will be differences .  | SO THE POWER had come to him , the President thought as the last J. cameraman gathered his gear and departed , as the last gaping tourist , privileged by sheer happenstance to have been in the vicinity , gathered his gaping wife and drowsy kids and drove away . The power had come to him : the ultimate power of America , which he had never sought and never wanted , being one of those who find in Washington their proper place and fill it to the full , knowing that this is right for them and that no amount of striving will make it any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides . There were not many such , he reflected with a grim little amusement . Not many such . Mr. Speaker had been a rarity because he had always known exactly the power he wanted , had gone after it , won it , and settled in without another ambition forever after . Until now . Until now .. He sighed , a small unconscious sound that went unnoticed in the velvet night with its enormous stars shining over Tahoe , its little cool wind rustling in the pines , its distant sounds of laughter and music from somewhere down the shore . He was alone on the porch for the first time in five hours . Inside , his sister and brother-in-law were getting ready for bed . In the two neighboring cabins , commandeered for press and Secret Service , the final poker game had ended , the last hectic political argument was over , the lights were going out . He would have liked to have known what they had said about him this evening , that shrewd , experienced crew whom he had known so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had always respected Mr. Speaker , for he had conducted himself with a dignity and forcefulness that had guaranteed they should . But in this past week at the wild convention , things had not been the same . For the first time his power had slipped , his commands had been flouted . His influence had been mocked and made the target of bitter attack . He had lost ground  --  too much ground . Senator Fred Van Ackerman had shrieked " Old man ! " at him in their bitter confrontation on the podium while the delegates listened in tense silence below : " An old , used-up man who has been around too long ! " And toward the end , though this was the fifth national convention he had chaired  --  or perhaps precisely  | because it was the fifth  --  he had almost lost control of the delegates , almost been exposed to the final humiliation of an open and successful revolt . In his own mind he had left San Francisco a defeated man , and he had not known whether he could recover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving serious consideration to the idea of putting the matter up to the party caucus in the House when Congress reconvened : should he step down as Speaker ? Of course he had known there was not the slightest chance they would accept it , but he had really not been thinking of it as a grandstand play . He had really almost come to the point where he had honestly meant to do it , so disturbed and depressed did he feel when he left San Francisco . And then suddenly  --  this . You never knew , in public life . You just never knew . The most fantastic thing you could dream could always be topped by the Lord 's reality . The Lord , the President had found over the years , had quite a sense of humor . He was often just full of tricks . Not , of course , that this particular example had been entirely unexpected . The method of it was certainly unexpected , so much so that the President , like every other American awake as midnight neared , was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act  --  after expressing condolences to Lucille Hudson and the families of the other victims  --  had been to appoint a commission . Already the retired dean of the Harvard Law School whom he had named to head it had called with the first of the sabotage rumors that had come to him ; and of course there would be many , many more as the months and years drew on . But whatever the commission concluded , it could never quite restore men to where they had been before the event . Some necessary self-confidence in everyone had been fundamentally shaken . Such events were so appalling , basically , because for just a moment they cut the ground right out from under life , revealed it for what it was , so frail and flimsy a thing ; made of men 's institutions and their hopes so helpless and feeble a mockery ; shattered all certainties , destroyed all pretensions , showed men what they really were in the scheme of things : nothing . That was the Lord 's real humor . He said to men , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Well , watch for a minute . " But though the method was unexpected and unbelievable , the possibility had never been entirely absent from the mind of the man who would have to bear the burden if it came . Ever since Harley had decided to leave the Vice Presidential office vacant , the possibility was always there . The Speaker had hoped it would not come to him in  | his mid-sixties , for many reasons : one of the main ones , emphasized harshly by his opponents at the convention , being the fact that he was in his mid-sixties . But the event happened . The burden came . The Lord and history combined forces and said : Do n't look over your shoulder for anyone else , friend . Nobody 's here . It 's you , all by your little self . So hop to it . And so you did , the President reflected , and again the little unconscious sigh escaped him . With a few exceptions , life had gone so much to order for William Abbott since he entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now that in his closing years such a violent shift in plans should have come about . Fortunately he was n't a worrying man , nor did he have any doubts about his ability to handle it . It was just that , as in that story Alben Barkley sometimes told when  --  the Speaker then a young and willing protege of Sam Rayburn  --  they used to sit around in Mr. Sam 's office replenishing body and spirit after a particularly tough session : " It 's the unexpectedness of it . " Unexpectedness , all things considered , had not been a feature of his life or his career since the day , at some point in the sixth grade in tiny Leadville , high in its cold , bright niche of the Rockies , when he made up his mind that he would be a member of the Congress of the United States . The figure who had inspired this decision at the age of twelve , he often reflected later with some amusement , had hardly been the type usually found in inspirational literature . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ womanizer and , in the belief of many of his hard-bitten associates in the mining industry , a peculator as well . He was , in short , a typical inspirational figure of a society in which men are free to be as noble or as base , or as much of both , as they can manage . But to little Billy Abbott in the sixth grade , hearing him roll out the ancient , welltried clarion calls of democracy against a background of great snowcovered peaks stabbing jaggedly into a sky so deeply blue and clear as to be unbelievable , he was inspiration enough . The Speaker-to-be had come home from the special school assembly at which the rather raffish keeper of democracy 's Grail had spoken to tell his mother that he was going to run for Congress . " When ? " she had inquired , not looking up from the stove where she was preparing lunch . " Next year , " he said firmly . " I 'll be there , " she promised , and when he announced his candidacy ten years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by auto , jeep and horseback around the still almost frontier district ; entertaining for him at the " Breakfasts with Bill " that did so much to persuade his women constituents to vote  | for their handsome young bachelor ; giving him shrewd and sensible advice with all the calm pragmatism of her Scandinavian nature . So , also , did his father , though he did not participate very actively in the campaign . He did n't have to : everybody knew Dr. Abbott , who had come West from Vermont as a young man to cure his tuberculosis and had somehow found his way to Leadville . There his reputation as an excellent doctor and a man of sound wisdom soon traveled far along the high , lovely meadows , up the tumbling river valleys and into the mines where hardy , pragmatic men wrestled with the earth to seize her treasure . " Doc " Abbott in his own quiet way was the greatest asset his son could have : a natural advance-man who had been preparing the way with diligence and rectitude for thirty years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always uttered in a terse , monosyllabic way . Between them , he and his wife gave their son all the support and guidance he could possibly need , having provided him initially with a strength of character and toughness of will that were to be his surest reliances in the years ahead . " I 'm half-Yank and half-Swede , " he used to tell his audiences in the early days , " and that 's a tough combination to beat . " They always laughed and applauded and agreed delightedly with one another that that sure was right , all right . His first campaign , against the same gallant knight who had first inspired him , now ten years older , drunker , shabbier and shadier , had not been a success in spite of what everyone in the district knew about the two of them . There was still a reluctance to kick out the old man ; after all , people were human , and he was one of the most human . In a hard way of life that nature at her harshest had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who drank , womanized , did n't pay too much attention to the finer items of dress , and now and again dipped too far into the till . And they knew him ; and they were tolerant ; and underneath the harshness , they were kind . So they gave him one last term , meanwhile sending some of their shrewdest men to tell him maybe he 'd better quit and take that judgeship Harry Truman was offering in the East . And within a year , having thought it all over and being no fool , he thanked them for their kindness and announced his retirement . The field was open to young Bill Abbott . The following year he went to Washington . He took with him the love of his parents and only sister , the faith of his constituents , and an education which had thrust him early , as it does so many who ultimately find their way to Capitol Hill , into the lively world of campus politics . He had decided he would educate himself to be a teacher , since common sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one might conceivably , however worthy , have to live one 's life outside Congress . But the area he decided to teach in , of course , was political science and government , and it would have been surprising if he had gone through four years of it without seeking student office . He ran twice at the University , for president of the freshman class , which he lost , and for president of the senior class , which he won . The years between were devoted to managing the campaigns of others ? " all part of my education , " he told his closest friend . " But I thought you were going to be a teacher , " his friend remarked with a smile . " Oh , I 'm going to teach people things , " he responded cheerfully . " Maybe not in classrooms , but I 'll teach ' em . " If there was any one lesson that loomed above the others at that early stage , it seemed to be : steady does it . There were no extremes in Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times a somewhat dull , one-track type of companion , this was more than compensated for by the absolute reliability and trustworthiness that soon came to be attached to his name . These , in fact , were the two traits that his associates had always considered characteristic . " Billy 's a rock , " they said on campus . " Bill Abbott 's a rock , " they said in his first twenty years in the House . " The Speaker 's a rock , " they said in his second twenty . And the President would have to be a rock now , he told himself as the noise down the shore began to diminish , the few lights he could see from other cabins along and across the lake began to go out , and the night took full possession . Yes , sir , the President would have to be a rock now . Perhaps it was the rocklike , one-track quality that had kept him from ever achieving what so many other men had , a wife and family . " You 're so damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , " one of his colleagues remarked jokingly when he was thirty and some bored reporter , with nothing else to write , had dreamed up a list of " Washington 's ten most eligible bachelors " and put him at the top of it . " In Leadville , " he replied , " we learn to move fast or get our tails frozen off . Guess I just outrace ' em . " And there , even in his own mind , he left it , as the years drew on , his routine became more settled , and other bored reporters kept the legend of his eligibility alive . Whether he actually was eligible , he never really paused to analyze . Certainly it was easy enough to plunge into the work of Congress so deeply that he could sooner or later forget the few hurtful things that happened along the way . He had tried to establish something lasting , now and then : it did n't succeed , for some reason he never quite understood . The antidote was work , and by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really married to this House , " was the way they put it on the Hill . " What do you suppose he does ? " they asked now and then when they were musing in the cloakroom . But nobody ever knew , and by that time he had already gathered about him such a mantle of calm , pragmatic dignity that nobody ever dared inquire too openly . Whatever he did , he reflected with a harsh amusement one time when he overheard such a conversation as he walked through the corridors , no real gossip about it ever got around in that gossipy place . So he stayed unmarried and wedded to the House , and as with some other famous bachelors in Congressional history , fidelity paid off with an ever-growing astuteness in legislative matters and an ever-greater dependence by his colleagues upon his sound common sense , good judgment and unfailing stability . No one ever saw Bill Abbott really upset except his secretary ; and she , bless her funny widowed old heart , had hovered over him with a fierce protectiveness for thirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else about the few times when she had come into the office and surprised him staring out the window with a sad , desolate set to his face and tears in his eyes . Such occasions always made her retire hastily and cry too , but within the hour the buzzer would sound and there he would be again , calm and efficient and so dignified that even she never dared mention it to him . The years passed and he worked hard and well at his committees , Appropriations and Foreign Affairs , and gradually , because he was such a rock and because other potential rivals one by one fell away as they moved through the decades together in the House , he became the almost inevitable heir apparent for the one office he really wanted , the Speakership . It was an office that had undergone its mutations through the years , from time to time being restricted by widely publicized revolts among the membership , but always , sooner or later , its powers were gradually restored until it became again what it basically always is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government . Its strength , he perceived after serving under Mr. Sam and his successors , depends in large measure upon the character of the occupant . " Revolts " are usually against the Speaker 's personality and methods , not so much against the inherent powers of his office . Any whittlingaway that is done can be smoothly and painlessly restored by the next man who comes along , if he is strong enough . Bill Abbott , watching them come and go , had no doubts about his own abilities to make of it just about what he wanted . When the time came , following the death of an old and generally incompetent Speaker who had let many of his prerogatives slip from his bumbling hands , Bill Abbott had little to do but express his desire  | and the battle was over . There was some opposition at the White House , because , while Bill had usually gone along with the Administration , he was recognized as a stolidly independent character who , at some crucial point , might not . A Speaker more pliable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania Avenue , a man who liked to have obedient men around him . But the will of the House was so obvious that the President , after a little grumbling , made the best of it by writing a letter in the Franklin Roosevelt style to an obscure freshman Congressman from New Hampshire ? " Dear Johnny : 1 ? You are kind enough to ask my advice on your choice for Speaker . If I were a member of the House , I think I would vote for ? " and Bill was in . The lesson of who had come around to whom was not lost on the House or anyone else . Perhaps because of this initial victory , he could reflect now , as the full impact of today 's events began to hit him and a creeping tiredness started to flood his mind and body , that he had managed to get along well with all the Presidents he had served in the twenty years of his Speakership . There had been frictions from time to time , and occasionally a pitched battle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . But he had supported most domestic legislation , and certainly he had given full endorsement to basic foreign policies . He had even approved , although somewhat reluctantly because he was aware of the great uneasiness on the Hill , Harley 's tandem decisions to go into Gorotoland , fight in Panama , and use the veto in the United Nations . The issues had been difficult and complex . Yet the facts that had brought them to climax had seemed sufficiently clear to Harley , and they seemed sufficiently clear to him . In Gorotoland , Prince Obifumatta and his Communist advisers ? masquerading as the People 's Free Republic of Gorotoland " ? had launched an attempt to overturn the legitimate government of his cousin , Prince Terry , as soon as Terry had successfully persuaded the UN to help him oust the British from their last remaining foothold in Central Africa . At first , President Hudson had kept the United States aloof from the struggle , but when Prince Obi 's forces had threatened an American missionary hospital and a Standard Oil installation , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , in common with the rest of the world , which had been conditioned by many American threats and little American action , did not believe him : forty-four missionaries had been tortured and killed , the Standard Oil installation had been blown up . Harley had ordered intervention , and immediately an enormous howl against " American aggression " and " oil imperialism " had risen around the globe . Many of the loudest screams came from  | America itself , where the group of influential columnists , publications , educators , churchmen , idealists and zanies , whom such as Walter Dobius spoke for , immediately attacked their own country with every vial of vitriol at their command . In Panama , simultaneously , Patsy 's estranged husband , the Panamanian Ambassador Felix Labaiya-Sofra , finding the United States committed on the other side of the sea , had finally put into operation his long-brewing plans to seize the Canal and drive the United States forever out of Panama . He , too , had Communist advisers and they , too , had the usual shining labels to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of Felix 's longtime ambition to rule his country and the Communists ' longtime ambition to capture the Canal ; but they called it " The Government of the Panamanian People 's Liberation Movement . " Again Harley ordered intervention and again the world howled , if possible more loudly than before . The UN in a series of hectic special sessions had passed resolutions condemning American aggression and calling for American withdrawal . Harley Hudson had astounded the world and pushed his critics to the point of near-catalepsy by ordering the first American vetoes in history . The consequence had been to throw the country , and the Presidential convention which shortly followed , into turmoil . But over and beyond the standard shrieks that had greeted every American move to oppose Communism since the Korean War , a genuine uneasiness and dismay had been created , and nowhere had it been more loudly or accurately reflected than it had been on Capitol Hill . There such men as Arkansas ' Senator Arly Richardson and Rep. J. B. " Jawbone " Swarthman , chairman of the House Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's actions . Resolutions supporting him had passed by only the narrowest of margins in both the Senate and the House . Against this background , the Speaker had laid his enormous prestige and influence on the line for Harley , and in consequence his prestige and influence after the convention were not what they had been before . But all that was academic now , because now he had power greater than that could ever be , and could do as he pleased . And what would he do ? Well , he imagined , just about what Harley would have done if Air Force One had behaved . The United States was in Gorotoland and Panama and Harley had told him privately a couple of days ago , " If I have anything to say about it , we 're in there to win as fast as we can . " It seemed a sensible policy to Old Rock Abbott then , he told himself with a wry self-mockery , and it seemed sensible  | now . Old Rock would keep it moving right along . Harley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . But first , of course , the funeral and all it would demand of its participants ; and then the necessary briefings so that he would know what he was talking about behind that big desk downtown , as no one on the Hill or anywhere else could really know except the one man in the world who sat behind it ; and then something decisive and direct , whatever the risk , because the risk of letting things drag , he felt , was greater than any other risk might be . And here , as he started to stand up and then sat slowly down again , one hand on the railing , his eyes wide in the night as he stared at the dark shore across , he came up against what was of course the most pressing problem of all . What of the election ? What of a campaign without a candidate ? What was he going to do about the national ticket that now was only half a ticket , and that half named Orrin Knox ? The thought of that volatile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ineffable character brought a half-smile , amused , affectionate , almost tender , to his lips for a moment . Dear old Orrin ! What on earth was going to happen to him now ? A year ago , at the height of the Senate battle over the nomination of Bob Leffingwell to be Secretary of State , when the Speaker and Orrin had met on the House steps in the terrible hours after Senator Brigham Anderson 's suicide , he had told Orrin he would back him for the Presidency . True to his word once given , which was one of his major characteristics and strengths , he had done as much as he could in the convention just past . They had both of necessity deferred to Harley when he changed his mind and decided to run , but as soon as the Speaker understood that Orrin would defer still further and accept second place , he had done all he could to assist him there , too . He still thought Orrin Knox the best-qualified man in the country to be in the White House . Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House . He had only held the office five hours , but the Presidency , as always , was imposing its own perspective . The Hudson-Knox ticket had carried the convention , but at an enormous cost in bitterness and division within the party . The President 's instinct now , as it had been during his years as Speaker , was to deplore party division and do everything he could to heal it over . Yet he was not fool enough to think it could be done under present circumstances , inflamed as they were by the forces supporting the candidacy  --  now  | obviously the revived candidacy  --  of Governor Edward M. Jason of California . Ted Jason , too , had been given a new position in the world by the crash of Air Force One . Five hours ago he had been so bemused and so bewildered by the destruction of his hopes at the convention that he was letting his supporters force him down the blind alley of a third party . All those powerful elements in the press , the intellectual community , the universities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempts to stop Communist aggression in Gorotoland and Panama had been about to push Ted to a political destruction he seemed powerless to resist . Not all their editorials , columns , broadcasts , headlines , one-sided photographs and news stories , statements , marches , protests , full-page ads in the New York Times and pious , pompous petitions to the White House had been able to force the convention to take the Governor . So they had been about to make him their sacrificial lamb to head a phony " Peace Party " which would , they obviously hoped , throw the election into chaos and paralyze the nation 's foreign policy during many crucial months . And Ted had apparently been about to let them do it . The organizing session of the rump convention was gathering at the San Francisco Hilton as the news flash came . The Governor of California was about to slip into the vortex , carried by ambition beyond the point that any sensible , responsible politician in his right mind would let himself go . Had he really wanted to create chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great that it could contemplate rule or ruin ? The President  --  who was , as the House had long ago found out , a most charitable man at heart  --  could only conclude so . Certainly he had to conclude so on the basis of the latest headlines from Ted : GOVERNOR JASON REPUDIATES THIRD PARTY , PLEDGES FIGHT FOR TOP SPOT . Ambition apparently was still the driving force . It had now turned Ted right around 18o degrees and set him back on the road . The President took a little comfort from the fact that at least it was the right road : it was within the party again , through regular channels that would restore the contest to some ground of responsible politics . But it certainly would do nothing to restore harmony to the party or unity to the country . It would instead keep alive and further aggravate the already deep divisions concerning America 's course in world affairs . Why could n't Ted have been a big enough man to get behind Orrin , who was Harley 's logical and rightful heir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did he have to continue to be ambitious and obstruc-tionist ? Of course , the President recognized with a sardonic shrug in the forest night , not everyone considered Ted ambitious and obstructionist . Millions thought him the greatest patriot in America . The conviction had been strengthened over the past couple of months , and was being strengthened now , by the powerful personalities and publications that did so much to influence public opinion in America . Somebody had brought him Walter Dobius ' column and the initial expression of editorial opinion by The Greatest Publication That Absolutely Ever Was . He had also seen the late news round-up chaired by Frankly Unctuous , that suavely destructive hero of the tyrannical tube . The same format had distinguished them all : a little politely dutiful earth quickly tossed over Harley  --  a hasty reference to his own almost incidental accession ( the New York Times had already produced the attack phrase for the pack to use : " The Caretaker President , " it called him ) ? and then a long , earnest discussion of why the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation out of the disastrous situation created by the late slightly lamented and his awful Secretary of State , Orrin Knox . Well , the President thought with a grim line to his jaw that members of the House would have recognized , " Caretaker , " was he ? Very well , he 'd take care . Of the country , and of Orrin , and of Ted Jason and the lot of them , if it came to that . Half-Yank and half-Swede , and that 's a pretty tough combination , all right , all right . Maybe they thought they could stampede him with such phony items as PRESSURE MOUNTS FOR RECALL OF CONVENTION . It had been datelined Washington , and had begun : " Powerful political forces here who can not presently be named called tonight for a reconvening of the national convention to select successor candidates to the late President Harley M. Hudson and Vice Presidential Nominee Orrin Knox . " Powerful political sources here who can not presently be named ! The President snorted . He knew those sources from long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Underwood and L. C. Smith . And most of them working overtime for Ted Jason . He snorted again . " Caretaker President " and the bland assumption  --  spurred on , of course , by the carefully concealed fear that he might just decide to " do a Harley " and run himself  --  that he would obediently get out of the White House as soon as possible .  | " Caretaker President " and the bland assumption that they could force him to reconvene the national convention . " The new President occupies a unique position in the party hierarchy in that he was , as Speaker , chairman of the National Committee , " the Times had written . " Presumably he retains this office , in the absence of any word from him ? " That 's right , the President thought grimly ? " and so has it in his power to call the Committee at once and instruct it to reconvene the national convention ? " Or not instruct it , he told them dryly . Or not even call it , for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a little decent rest and honorable men could again begin to take up political matters . Except that of course he knew better than that . Honorable men and dishonorable men were all busy on politics this minute , and had been from the moment they heard the news . It was the nature of the system , and no point in being pious about that . But there were fictions that could be used , and like everyone in politics , he had used them on many occasions . The fiction that a great quietus lay on politics until a leader was decently buried was one of them . He could use it now as he had before and outwardly keep up the pretense of respectful inaction , though he knew he would be bombarded  --  and might do a little bombarding himself  --  on all sides in the next few days . One thing nobody could do : nobody could make him move faster than he wanted to . Walter could write , Frankly could fulminate , The Greatest Publication and its colleagues could assault the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand in line and pound on his door , and still nobody could make him move . He had learned the value , in the House , of taking some time to think , and now he was going to stand firm for a while and have it . Nobody had ever pushed the Speaker around much . Nobody was going to push the President around , either . He realized with a start that it must be almost one A.M. " My God , I 'm tired , " he remarked quietly to the little predawn wind that was beginning to probe through the pines . He stood up abruptly and went in to bed , where he fell asleep without delay and without dreams .  | " swEhiu , " Patsy Jason Labaiya said from her enormous redwood desk in Dumbarton Oaks next morning , " you simply must talk to him . You simply MUST . He wo n't listen to me , I KNOW that . It 's got to be someone he respects , like you . " For a moment she thought her sister-in-law was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the other end of the line at " Vistazo , " the enormous Jason ranch in the burnt-umber hills above Santa Barbara . But presently Ceil Jason responded in a tone that was , for her , surprisingly impatient . " Oh , Patsy , why wo n't you stop meddling ? Things have gone to a point now where I do n't think anyone ? " " But they have n't gone to that point at all , sweetie ! " Patsy interrupted indignantly . " Not at ALL . Now that Ted 's repudiated that STUPID third party , everything 's just the way it was . He can run for President again , now that that old fool ? " " Patsy ! " Cell exclaimed , genuinely shocked . " Well , I 'm sorry he got killed , " Patsy conceded defiantly , " but I 'm not sorry he 's out of Ted 's way . He never should have done and said the things he did . " " And Ted should have said and done what he did ? " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win the nomination , " Patsy said . " But he did n't win it , did he ? " " No , " his sister said with a sudden waspish note in her voice , " because that  --  that  --  gang  --  of old reactionaries led by Harley and Orrin blocked him from doing it . That does n't mean the convention did n't want him , and does n't want him still . Now , you KNOW that , Ceil , so why keep pretending ? " There was a sigh , half-exasperated , half-amused , from " Vistazo . " " Patsy , you wear me out . What makes you so sure the convention still wants him ? Anyway , who says the convention 's going to have a chance ? The President does n't have to reconvene the convention ? " " No , but sooner or later he 's got to call the National Committee , and they can reconvene the convention . That 's why you 've got to call Bob Leffingwell immediately and get him to help us persuade the Committee members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not for the first time , by  | the Jasons ' ability to ignore all obstacles and ride roughshod toward what they wanted . " That 's exactly what I mean about things having gone too far . You heard Bob 's nominating speech for Harley and the attack he made on Ted . Devious ' and playing fast and loose with principle ' and all the rest of it . How on earth can you ask him to work for you now ? " " Oh , poof ! Poof , POOP ! That was an entirely different set of circumstances . Bob did n't nominate Orrin , did he ? " " No , Harley did . " " Well , then : why assume Bob 's for Orrin now ? He owed Harley a debt for salvaging his career after he was defeated for Secretary of State , but who defeated him ? Orrin Knox ! Maybe that was n't going so far nothing can be done about it , ' I ask you ! " " Even so , I do n't think there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to come back to Ted just because he may not like Orrin . And I do n't think he 's all that influential , either , especially after all the things that were said about him at the convention . " Patsy sniffed . " Everybody said a lot of things about everybody at the convention . That 's what conventions are for . People 's emotions do n't change basic political realities . The reality is that Ted is going to win that nomination now , and that Bob will have to back him against Orrin . And Bob is influential , Ceil . He 's lost a little ground , maybe , but the minute he announces for Ted , Walter Dobius and everybody else in the press will start praising him again . He has n't lost them permanently . They 'd love to come back if he 'll give them the chance . The professional liberals , " she said with a dry savagery that startled her sister-in-law , who had thought she was one of them , " never really like to abandon a hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'll take him back if he gives the slightest sign that he 's willing to behave from now on . " " Bob is n't a member of the National Committee ? " " We 're going to organize this just like the convention , " Patsy said . " We 're opening a headquarters here in Washington tomorrow morning and we 're going to issue releases and hold press conferences , and all the rest of it . Bob can head it up again if he wants to . It would be a great help to us . We 're already getting marvelous support from the press and the networks . You 've probably seen Walter 's column and some of the editorials . CBS wants to do a half-hour interview with Ted from here after the funeral on Wednesday , and NBC is planning to do one , too , I believe . They 're going to call it Party Without a President : " " That should please President Abbott , " Ceil remarked . " That should  | please him very much . Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not Bob Leffingwell and the Committee members ? " " He 's only ONE , " Patsy said tartly . " But look where he lives now . A rather big ONE , I 'd say . " " He ca n't control what the Committee does ! All he can do is try to influence it for Orrin , I suppose . And we 're going to influence it for Ted . So our chance is as good as his . Better , because the convention still wants Ted . Ca n't you see , " she demanded , " what a perfect COUP it would be if he and Bob are reconciled ? Right now Bob still has a lot of his old liberal support , and by nominating Harley he 's picked up a lot of conservatives , too . He 's a symbol of the honest man who genuinely stands in the middle , now . He genuinely does . They 'll listen to what he says . But , sweetie , he wo n't listen to me , because he does n't like me right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe . So you 've got to call him for us . He 's apparently trying to avoid Ted . " " Why should he like me ? " Ceil inquired . " I 'm Ted 's wife . " She uttered the sudden little sardonic chuckle that sometimes upset her inlaws . " In a manner of speaking . " " That 's exactly why , dear , " Patsy said smoothly . " You are  --  but there 's a little doubt about it at the moment , because you 've been so dramatic , leaving him at the crucial moment of the convention and sneaking away down there ? " " I did n't sneak , " Ceil said mildly . " I told him where I was going . " " Well , anyway , you LEFT . That 's the main thing . And yet you 're still his wife , of course , and I suppose will remain so  --  you will , wo n't you ? " she asked in abrupt alarm . " You are n't really thinking about doing anything foolish ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tired tone . " I just wanted to think things out by myself . If a simple desire for reflection is something the Jason family can understand . " " Then that makes you the perfect one to call Bob , " Patsy said triumphantly . " You 're  --  with Ted , but you 're not actually too  --  close  --  at the moment . It gives YOU a nice independent status , too . Have you talked to Ted ? " " Not lately . " " Well . Fm sure this is EXACTLY what he would want you to do . " " No doubt . " " Well . You will , then . " " I 'm not making any promises . " " Well , at least you 'll think about it ? " Patsy began in a concerned tone .  | " I 'm thinking about a lot of things , " Ceil told her . " Goodbye , Patsy . Thanks for calling . " " But , Ceil ? " There was a firm click ! from California , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought angrily . Cell had always been an uncertain element in the Jason campaign to put Ted in the White House . Sometimes Patsy thought that all Ceil ever wanted to do was be beautiful and ride on Ted 's name to wherever it might take her . She had never really believed in him the way his sister did . She looked out through the vines that shaded the big windows of her study , to the tennis court and the pool beyond . It was close to noon . Nothing stirred . Washington 's suffocating summer heat had the world flat on its back . " Thank God for air-conditioning , " she said aloud . She put her finger tips together and narrowed her eyes . " Well ! " she said . " What shall I do next ? " But as always with Patsy , the question was rhetorical . She already had an idea , and pulling the telephone once more toward her , she dialed a number and began to set it in motion . At the same moment , at the airport , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet his wife Dolly and the widowed First Lady and her two Secret Service escorts , was facing half a dozen reporters after a swift and uneventful flight in the special Air Force plane provided by the President . They wanted to know a lot of details that he was n't about to tell them : Had Lucille Hudson balked at taking an airplane back to Washington ? Had she been worried because it was an Air Force plane ? Was she in reasonably good spirits ? Had she been crying ? Who did he think the party 's new standard bearers would be ? Would Orrin Knox get the nomination now ? All of these he had refused to answer , with a curt impatience that prompted the New York Times to murmur to The Greatest Publication That Absolutely Ever Was , " Our Robert seems awfully tense about something . You do n't suppose Abbott 's putting the hex on Orrin , do you ? " To which the G.P. murmured back , " It might be worth a little analyzing , I should think . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't make him mad enough to say something interesting , when the cabin door opened again and the First Lady , heavily veiled , came slowly out on Dolly Munson 's arm and started down the steps . In the ensuing hubbub the photographers got some wonderful pictures , even if the reporters  | did n't get quite the factual story from Senator Munson that they wanted . But they were old hands at interpreting the moods of the great , and a few minutes later The Greatest Publication 's man was back in his office in the National Press Building tapping out the thinkpiece that he would send to New York to run alongside his colorful and moving account of Lucille Hudson 's return to a black-draped White House . " An obviously troubled Senate Majority Leader Munson , " it began , " apparently concerned that the death of President Harley M. Hudson may blast the Presidential hopes of his longtime friend , Secretary of State Orrin Knox ? " WHITE HOUSE MAY DUMP KNOX IN NEW BALLOTING , MUNSON FEARS , the headline said . An hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Leesburg , forty miles out from the capital in the slumbering Virginia countryside , Walter Dobius , just back from San Francisco , read the item on his newsagency ticker ( " Can you match Greatest Wh Hu Knox dump ? " the New York office had queried the Washington bureau , and the Washington bureau had speedily obliged ) . Then he put a sheet of paper in his typewriter to start tomorrow 's column . " It is apparent already , " he wrote swiftly , " that the arrogance with which Secretary of State Knox has claimed the Presidential nomination following the death of President Hudson may be somewhat premature . If the attitude of Senate Majority Leader Robert M. Munson of Michigan is to be believed  --  and most observers here consider the Majority Leader to be one of the nation 's shrewdest political weather vanes  --  there appears to be what might justly be termed a growing disenchantment with the Secretary 's ambitions on the part of the new President , William Abbott .... " Within two hours after that , the correspondents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little man from Tass , the correspondents of the French , German and Italian news agencies , the man from the Times of India , the lady who wrote for the Swedish newspapers , and the correspondent of News-Arabia , had all cabled stories to the general effect that the new President was rapidly cooling toward Secretary Knox and would probably toss him off the ticket . And by the time he presented his special six P.M. Sunday news broadcast , " The Course of the Week , " Frankly Unctuous was able to fix the camera with a forthright , candid and earnest eye and tell his countrymen in his customary suave , plum-pudding tones : " It is already apparent , here in this capital still rocking from the terrible tragedy that has brought a new man into the White House , that  | the new man may not be so wedded to the Presidential hopes of Secretary of State Orrin Knox as the Secretary would obviously like to believe . " The tip-off may have come shortly after noon today when Senate Majority Leader Munson , arriving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be worried and reluctant to discuss Mr. Knox 's prospects with reporters . " It is being generally assumed here that Senator Munson , who worked in the closest relationship with President Abbott during the latter 's long tenure as Speaker of the House , may possibly know something that Secretary Knox does not know . If this growing conviction among those who study politics day by day should prove to be correct , it may well be that the Secretary 's claim upon the nomination  --  which he volunteered yesterday scarcely three hours after President Hudson 's tragic death  --  will turn out to be premature . Add to this growing uncertainty about Mr. Knox 's prospects the equally lively conviction that Governor Edward M. Jason of California now has once again become the major contender for the nomination , and it is easy to see ? " " It 's easy to see , you twisting son of a bitch , " the Majority Leader said quietly in the comfortable home of Orrin and Beth Knox in Spring Valley , " that all you bastards are now out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't we just turn you off and enjoy a little silence for a change ? " And reaching forward to the set , he did so and then sat back with a sympathetic look at his host . " Orrin , " he said , " I 'm afraid you 've got another fight on your hands . " " " When did I not have ? " the Secretary of State inquired . " I no longer care , Bob . I 've got to go ahead living , I ca n't afford to let myself be handicapped by that sort of thing . And maybe by now the techniques are so obvious that the public is beginning to be on guard a little . This performance Frankly and Walter and the rest are putting on is typical . You arrived at the airport and refused to talk ? " " I was really worried about getting Lucille back to the mansion before she broke down again , " Bob Munson said mildly . " I also resented all those political questions at a time like that . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know you have n't . Your crime , you see , was that you did n't want to answer . So the door was wide open for the broadest possible latitude in interpreting your non-cooperation . This tied in neatly with the general urge to cut me down before I can get started , so the standard techniques went right to work . You heard Frankly : " The President may not be so wedded ' to my hopes ' as I would  | obviously like to believe . ' You gave the tip-off ' because you appeared ' to be worried and reluctant ' to discuss my future . Nobody says you actually were worried and reluctant , of course , you just appeared ' to be . Because you have had the closest relationship ' with the Speaker , you may possibly ' ? not for sure , but may possibly ' ? know something ' that I do n't know . " If this conviction , ' which naturally is growing ' among those who study politics day by day ' should prove to be correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomination  --  which I volunteered scarcely three hours ' after Harley 's death , heartless bastard that I am  --  will turn out to be premature : " These same carefully anonymous students of politics day by day ' share the equally lively conviction ' that Ted has once again become the major contender for the nomination ' and so is easy to see ' ? just what is it easy to see , Bob ? " " It 's easy to see that the English language in certain hands these days has become so smooth as to be practically subliminal , " the Majority Leader said dryly . " It 's easy to see that this is the sort of thing that comes out of Washington day in and day out about any person or cause that the major commentators and publications do n't like . All the public has to do is read and listen with an ounce of attention and there they are almost every time you pick up a paper or turn a dial  --  the little knife-words and knife-phrases that cut a man down . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't love Ted Jason are n't going to be able to do much to stem the tide . . . . Except , of course , " he said more soberly , " that it 's got to be stemmed . " " Why does it ? " Orrin inquired in an oddly distant , offhand manner . " We 've got a President in the White House . He 's committed to the policies we believe in . Why should we worry ? They 'll have a tough time getting him out if he decides to run . " " I do n't think he will run , " Senator Munson said slowly . His host gave him a sudden sharp look . " But you do n't know . " He shrugged . " No , I do n't know . But from what I know of Bill , in my long , close relationship , I would find it a little hard to believe . " " But not impossible , " the Secretary said . " Not impossible . And maybe it would be best , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe I I should be the sacrificial lamb , so they can all concentrate on me while Bill goes about lining up the National Committee to give him the nomination . Shall we work for that ? "  | The Majority Leader studied him for a moment . Then he smiled . " Who is this noble soul I 'm talking to ? Is this the Orrin Knox I know from yesteryear , The Man Who Would Be President ? Say not so ! " " You can laugh if you like , " Orrin said calmly , " but that 's the way I feel now . That convention was n't easy for me , either , Bob . Nor has it been easy to try three times for the Presidential nomination , and lose . I 've about had it , with politics . I 'll take it if I can get it , certainly , but I do n't think any more that the end of the world is going to come if I do n't . I used to , but I think I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill , if that 's what he wants . He 's a good man . " " One of the best , " Senator Munson said . " But I do n't think he 's going to let you get out that easily . " " What does he want me to do , then , stay where I am and run for Vice President ? I 'm perfectly willing to do that , too , if that 's what he wants , " " Now , just how does that jibe , " Senator Munson inquired thoughtfully , " with your volunteering ' for the nomination ? What were those headlines I saw last night ? SECRETARY KNOX SAYS , I EXPECT TO HEAD THE TICKET ' ? " Orrin shrugged . " I was just establishing my territory . To hold for me , or hold for him , if he wants it . I did n't think it should go by default . " " I must say you 're in a funny mood , " Bob Munson told him . " Is it because Beth and Hal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Secretary 's face became uncharacteristically somber for a moment . " I think it 's because of Harley , basically . " Senator Munson nodded . " What a hell of a thing , " he said slowly . " Poor Harley . What a hell of a thing ! " " It makes all ambitions seem a little pointless , you know ? " Orrin said . " To say nothing of all those other poor devils who died with him . It really was frightful , and yet here we sit ? " Senator Munson smiled wryly . " Discussing ambitions . " " Yes , " the Secretary said somberly . " Yes ... But " ? and he too smiled for a moment ? " he would have understood , bless his heart . You ca n't keep politics from going right along , particularly under circumstances like these . " " For which there are no precedents , " Senator Munson said with a certain grimness , " so I think we 'd damned well better make some . Now : you 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President  --  is n't going to run . So get out of this noble mood or whatever it is , and get busy . And do n't you show any signs of weakening , to anybody . " " Oh , I 'm not going to , " Orrin said . " I 'm not taking any press calls , so how can I disclose to them how trembling and uncertain I am ? Only you , old friend , have The Tip-Off  --  being one of those who study politics day by day . " " And do n't get too flippant , either , " Bob Munson said . " This is no picnic . The Jasons are out to win this time . Patsy 's opening an office at loo . Connecticut Avenue tomorrow morning and the game will be on . " You know , " Orrin said in the tone of voice that so many in Washington , even the most friendly , used when discussing the Jasons , " sometimes I simply get speechless at the bad taste of that family . It 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , but to actually go ahead and open an office and start campaigning before the President is even laid in his grave  --  only the Jasons would have the gall and the boorishness to do it . " " They 're quite a crew , " the Majority Leader agreed , thinking of Ted in his big dark-paneled , green-carpeted office in Sacramento ; of his aunt , Selena Jason Castleberry , giving her wild parties for wild causes in New York ; her sister , Valuela , painting a little , loving a lot , in Portofino ; their brother Herbert , Nobel Prize-winning scientist and leader of demonstrations , always ready to march in the name of world peace and the damnation of his own country ; Patsy , whirling about in Washington , getting her long-distance divorce from Felix Labaiya down in Panama , devoting her time and noisy concentration to the Presidential ambitions of her brother . Quite a crew , sitting atop their millions that dated back to the Spanish occupation of California : quite a crew , who bought what they wanted if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , having failed to put Ted over at the convention , they were about to throw their enormous millions once more into the opportunity presented by the catastrophic behavior of Air Force One . Bob Munson sighed . " What 's the matter ? " Orrin asked . " Just agreeing with you about the Jasons . But , that means you 've got to come on strong and stay ahead of them , if you can . What do you plan to do ? " " I thought you 'd advise me , " the Secretary said with a smile . Then he became serious . " What I 've got to do , as I see it , is to continue exactly as I am . I 'm going to issue a statement this evening , which I think  | will push Ted down the front page a little , I hope , to the effect that the United States will continue to fight for freedom and stability in Gorotoland and Panama with all the vigor and power at our command . " " That sounds quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you cleared this with Bill ? " " Certainly . " " Oh , you have been in touch with him , then . " " He called a little while ago . " " But he did n't mention the nomination . " " No . Why should he ? " " There you go again , " Bob Munson remarked , " being whimsical . So all right , you 've talked to him . How did he sound ? " " Rather Presidential himself . And a little disturbed by the first findings of the commission on the accident . They 've already discovered , you know , that two of those crew members were in some sort of Communist operation with headquarters in Annapolis . And they found one corpse carrying a loaded pistol with the safety catch off , who also had in his pocket a picture of Ted and a copy of Walter Dobius ' last column on the convention  --  in which , you may recall , he virtually urged armed rebellion because Harley and I had won . So , who knows ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I doubt very much , " Senator Munson said dryly , " that the last little item  --  the gentleman with the gun , the picture and the column  --  will ever see the light of day on the newsstands . It 's the sort of thing that somehow just gets lost somewhere between the copy desk and the street in most publications of the pro-Ted type . Now , if the poor crazy fool had been carrying your picture-my God , what a sensation . " " I 'm afraid you 're very cynical , " Orrin said . " I 'm sure the man will be mentioned in a footnote on Page 3001 of the commission report . Any citizen who wants to read that far will be able to find it . Anyway , Bill sounded as though he had slipped into harness without a hitch . But then , when has n't he measured up to the jobs he has had to do ? Do you realize how much of the government has depended upon Mr. Speaker in the last twenty years ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't an office the public knows too much about . I want to talk to him myself . When 's he coming back ? " The Secretary smiled . " He said he liked it at Tahoe  --  the cabin 's on a little point and they can hold it like a fortress against the press . Except my water side , ' he said . My water side 's a little vulnerable , but after I 've been here a month or two I 'll probably have it fortified . ' I expect he 'll stay out until  | the funeral . He does n't want to be too accessible , and he also wants to let Lucille have the house until she 's ready to go . " " It wo n't be long , " Bob Munson said . " Dolly 's over there right now helping her pack . I expect she 'll be out Wednesday afternoon right after she gets back from Arlington . She told me she did n't want to spend the night there alone after he left it . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , " Bob Munson said slowly . " I think perhaps she might want to get involved in the campaign . I 'm not sure , of course , but perhaps if you ? " " Oh , I could n't ask her , " On-in said , looking shocked . " Although , " he added honestly , " it would be nice if she did . " He looked around the comfortable room , cool and dark in contrast to the heavy heat outside . " Are you sure you do n't want anything to drink ? " " No , thanks . I really must be running along in a minute . I 've got to get back to the White House to plan the funeral , as she asked me to . And I 've also got to do some more telephoning about the National Committee meeting . " " What 's your guess on when it will be ? " " You mean Bill did n't tell you ? " Bob Munson inquired in mock surprise . The Secretary shook his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he can wait much beyond the funeral , though . Walter Dobius and Company and I agree on that " Bob Munson nodded . " Right , there 's got to be action , and fast . If I know Bill , he 's doing a lot of thinking about how to approach it . What are you going to do for a campaign manager , by the way ? Is Stanley going to help you again ? " Thinking of the Senate Majority Whip , Stanley Danta of Connecticut , still shattered by the brutal attack on his daughter Crystal at the Cow Palace , the Secretary sighed . " I do n't know that Stanley has much heart for it . I think I may have to find someone else . " " That was my feeling when we started east on the Zephyr together , " Bob Munson said . " He hated to leave the kids , but felt he had to get back here to tend to some things on the Hill . The minute the news came about Harley , he seized the excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orrin nodded . " Yes , that 's really why I decided to leave them there and come on back . I would n't have left until Tuesday if he had n't been there to keep them company . " He frowned . " I wish Beth would hurry up and arrive . She ought to be here with Dolly , helping Lucille. "  | " And helping you , " Bob Munson said . Orrin smiled . " And helping me . She 'll be arriving this evening , I believe , and then I 'll be in better shape for whatever comes . . . . About a campaign manager , I . . . have an idea . " Senator Munson nodded . " Yes , so do I. But will he do it , and is he all that valuable to you ? " The Secretary frowned again . " I do n't really know , exactly . Robert A. Lef ingwell is a puzzle , to me . I still have n't got him quite figured out . I can understand his supporting Harley , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether he would have actively supported a ticket with me on it too , I do n't know . And , " he added thoughtfully , " I do n't really know exactly what his value is ; whether he really is that important in the scheme of things ; whether the beating he 's taken from the press since he left Ted to back Harley may not have hurt him so much with the public that he 'd be more handicap than help . I 've tried to reach him several times , because I do want to talk to him and find out what I think about him after I 've done so . . . . It 's an idea . I 'm not closing it out . It could be he 'd be very helpful . It 's a possibility . " " I think you should have a real talk with him , " Bob Munson said . " And go into it with an open mind and a friendly manner . That 's the only way to find out . " " I will as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said with some annoyance . " But where is he ? Talking to Ted , I suppose . That would be just my luck . " But in this instance , though he did not know it , his luck was holding all right , because Bob Leffingwell was not talking to Ted at the moment . Nor was anyone else . The Governor of California , in fact , was sitting all alone in his office in Sacramento , staring out over the beautifully kept lawns that looked so cool and shaded under their enormous trees despite the fact that right now the capital of California was even hotter and more humid than the capital of the country . Inside the east wing of the Capitol building , however , it was genuinely cool , hushed and quiet on this Sunday morning . A couple of state troopers were on duty , a few tourists wandered even on so sweltering a day , a janitor or two shu OO ed along the gleaming halls . Otherwise he had his domain to himself , and that was the way he liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowding in upon him , clamoring for decision . The most important of all , of course , was already decided : immediately after the news of Harley 's death had flashed upon the screen  | in his room at the Mark Hopkins Hotel , he had cut himself loose , with an instinctive , almost animal , repugnance , from the tatterdemalion ragtag-and-bobtail of the foredoomed " Peace Party . " Within five minutes he had framed his statement repudiating the third-party movement and affirming his renewed determination to seek the Presidential nomination . He had spent the next hour rewriting it until it was as succinct and powerful as he felt it should be . As soon as the Speaker 's swearing-in had been completed at Tahoe , Ted was on the telephone dictating it to his secretary in Sacramento . Fifteen minutes later she had called the wire services , and within the hour it was top news across the nation . Not , inevitably , the only top news : right along with it had come Orrin Knox 's confident statement that he expected to head the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponent was in reality , but of necessity he had to sound confident , and he had managed it very well . " The United States has lost a great President and a great leader in the cause of world peace , " Orrin had said . " He was my friend and my commander in the battle against the forces of aggression that everywhere threaten free men . I honor his memory as I valued his friendship . " The task he began must be completed . American foreign policy must have the continuity and firmness that alone can guarantee the survival of this nation and of freedom everywhere . " A leader is fallen but the battle goes on . " An election must be fought and won . " I expect to head the ticket . " I expect to finish the great work he began . " I call upon all of you who believe in an America firm in strength and firm in justice to give me your help and support in the task we must all carry forward together . " Ted had been no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost a distinguished and able leader , who led her , as he sincerely believed best , through perilous times . Those of us who disagreed with some aspects of his policies were ever aware that his ideals were admirable , his purposes sincere , his integrity unimpeachable . No one could have asked for a more dedicated and honorable man to lead this nation . " His tragic death reopens many issues that appeared to have been settled by his nomination at the convention just concluded . Because of this , those of us who disagreed with certain policies are now freed of political commitments . Many things must now be reapproached and  | reappraised . The way is open to reconsider decisions that only yesterday seemed settled for the duration of the present campaign . " For myself , let me make it clear that I repudiate , once and for all and absolutely , any attempt to divide America by the creation of a so-called peace party . ' The formation of such a third party was proposed , as you know , by those claiming to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without my approval . Now , any such political adventuring is even more inexcusable and pointless than it was before . " What happens now must occur through the regular channels of the party . A nominee for President and , presumably , a nominee for Vice President , must be selected . And our great party must decide once and for all what it stands for . " I was a candidate for President before . I am a candidate now . Whether by selection of the National Committee or through a reconvened convention , the party must choose . " Either this great nation follows the course of further international adventuring , ever-spreading foreign commitments , ever more entangling military involvements  --  or it follows the course of prudence , decency and peace . " I offer myself again , as I did before , as one who believes our best course to lie in negotiation , reasonable compromise , and an end to jingoism and bullying belligerence . " I speak now , as I did before , for peace . I call upon all of you who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join me in the renewed battle . " We must not fail . " Rereading the two statements as they lay before him on the front page of the Sacramento Bee , the Governor reflected that his own accomplished several things . It paid graceful tribute to the man who had so brutally shouldered him aside at the convention , thereby displaying a forgiveness he could never have shown had Harley lived  --  an absolutely necessary forgiveness if the votes of many goodhearted citizens were to come his way . It cleared his mind of the heavy burden of selfcontempt that had dragged it down since the bleak post-convention moment when Senator Fred Van Ackerman , that savagely unprincipled demagogue of the irresponsible left , had telephoned and virtually forced him to accept the third-party idea . And it established him again as the champion of all those forces that were so bitterly and vociferously opposed to American involvement in the twin conflicts of Gorotoland and Panama . Thus he had freed himself of the fatal incubus of the hodge-podge  | " Peace Party , " something he would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely stunned by the convention 's repudiation and President Hudson 's bitter speech attacking him . At the same moment he had skillfully re-established his claim upon the position favored by those who had supported him but could not follow him down so blind an alley . The Greatest Publication was such a one : it had warned him against the third party even though its editorial board was unanimously for him and had given him every possible break in friendly news-coverage , flattering photographsand editorial endorsement during and before the convention . Some of the major columnists and commentators were equally hesitant , aware that American history gave little encouragement to third parties . Of the small but enormously powerful group who influenced and in large measure dominated public opinion , only Walter Dobius , carried forward furiously on the wave of his angry hatred for Harley Hudson and Orrin Knox , had openly endorsed and encouraged the third party idea . Even he , Ted Jason was willing to wager with some irony , was greatly relieved that Harley 's death made it no longer necessary to carry through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter , for The Greatest Publication , and for all their friends and fellow-believers of press , television , church , drama , campus and periodical , everything was now all right again : Despised Harley was dead , Orrin stood exposed alone to the attacks of those who could once more reunite against him with a good conscience and a strengthened will , and the Governor of California was in the clear . Once again he was the hero of all those who , either sincerely or for purposes not so sincere , devoted their time and energies to opposing , hindering , demeaning and generally weakening their own country as it sought , with an uncertain success , to stand firm against its enemies and the enemies of freedom everywhere . Respectability and the support of many of the nation 's most powerful institutions and individuals were his again , and it was with some confidence that he looked forward to the next few weeks : confidence and , much more important , the renewed self-respect which , coming out of the angry morass of the convention , seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had followed upon things that could have destroyed a weaker man and had almost destroyed him : the increasing , politically motivated violence in the convention which , he was sufficiently confident to admit to himself now , he had tacitly if not openly condoned  --  the appearance of the black-uniformed bullyboys produced by COMFORT , DEFY and KEEP , those strange ideological bedfellows ,  | culminating in the attack on Crystal Danta Knox which was probably , he could see now , the decisive turning point of the convention and the beginning of the end of his own chances  --  followed by his humiliating defeat for the Presidential nomination  --  the President 's crushing denial of his right to the Vice Presidential nomination  --  his own deep despair and the dreadful dazed , helpless , almost comatose condition in which he had submitted to Fred Van Ackerman 's bullying and agreed to appear at the third party meeting . He had been as near nadir as he had ever come in all his life , probably as near as any Jason had ever come in all the long years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish California . He literally did not know what would have become of him had the President not been killed . He drew a sudden long , shivering breath . How awful the prospects had been for the golden hero of the Golden State ; how miraculous his salvation . Surely there must be a purpose in it somewhere ! As quickly as it came , the mood passed . Governor Jason was not one to brood overlong on might-have-beens . If there was purpose , it was up to him to implement it . By some strange kindness or irony , the Lord had given him another chance . This time he would not destroy it but would see it through with vigor , integrity and all the determination of a clever mind , to which family character and great wealth had long ago given the habit of decisive command . Three days after his descent into the abyss of abandoned hope , he was on the way back ; and with only a very little extra luck , he would not only regain his former position but go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of when the convention roared out of his control . " In January , " he said with a quiet certainty to the silent office , " Edward Montoya Jason will be President of the United States . " As if in response , the telephone rang ; and lifting it to listen while the switchboard carried out his instructions to take the message but deflect the caller , he heard a voice he had not expected to hear unless he initiated the call . He felt a sudden surge of happiness . That she had called first seemed somehow to put the seal on all his certainties . " I 'll take this , Operator , " he broke in ; and then , his voice , despite his best efforts , trembling a little , " Good morning . Where are you ? " " I 'm still at the ranch , " Ceil said . " Have you been home ? " " No , " he said . " I just came up from San Francisco this morning . I came directly here . " " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , you ought to have a good one . These are challenging times . " " Yes , I know , " he said , absurdly relieved that she should use her  | usual bantering tone . " I 'm not being too active at the moment , though : just sitting here thinking . " " Is anyone with you ? " " No , " he said ; and ventured , " Not even my wife . " " Whose fault is that ? " " I do n't know , " he said , trying to keep it light though his voice trembled a little again . " I came back to the Mark and found a note that you had gone to Vistazo : I did n't think I had kicked you out . " " I suppose it was a little abrupt , " she conceded . " But I suddenly had just had it . " " I thought I had too , " he said quietly . " It was n't very obvious at the time , " she said thoughtfully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have some pride , after all . " " Yes , I know .... What are you doing now ? " " Just thinking . " " The Capitol on Sunday 's a good place for it , I guess . I saw your statement , of course . " " Did you like it ? " " I thought it was very good from your standpoint . " " That is n't what I asked , " he said , attempting jocularity . " Well , I do n't know how else to state it , " she said slowly , and he could visualize the characteristic little frown of concentration . " It was n't so good from mine . " " Why not ? " he asked , and because he was afraid of sounding plaintive , sounded sharp . " I 'm sorry , " he said instantly . " I did n't mean to sound impatient . I 'm  --  still under a lot of strain , I guess . " " That 's all right , I understand . I meant that it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose any such statement has to , of course . " " Did n't Orrin 's ? " he asked , again sharp ; and this time he did not apologize . " Oh , yes , " she agreed . " I 'm not arguing that . " " What would you have me do ? " he demanded . " Not run ? " " I do n't think you have a choice in the world . " " All right , then . " " Either from a political standpoint or a family one . " " What do you mean by that ? " he inquired , making it lighter . " My fatal Jason blood ? " " Your fatal Jason compulsion to take top prize if you possibly can . " " Do you think it 's just for the prize ? " And again , to his annoyance ,  | his voice trembled a little . He did n't want to sound supplicant , but he knew he was . " Do n't you think I have any ideals and principles about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Vistazo " and he knew exactly what she was saying to him : Ideals and principles after the things you did and condoned at the convention ? And suddenly he was overwhelmed by this himself , and for several seconds was silent also , buffeted by a hundred unhappy thoughts . Finally , because he must , he spoke . " Ceil ? " he said tentatively . " Do you think Fm really as  --  as awful  --  as ? as I have seemed to be ? " " Do you want an honest answer ? " " I know I always get one from you , " he said , attempting a little laugh that did n't really come off . " Yes , " she said , and sighed . " I suppose you do . That 's probably the trouble . " " No trouble . I just want to know if I am . " " Well ? " she sighed again . " What am I supposed to say to that ? I think you did things you should n't have done . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that should n't have been done . I did n't approve of them . So I left . I have n't changed my mind about them . They still disturb me , very much . I think what you ought to do now is stay out of it . Orrin has a right to it . The convention decided for the President and Orrin , let Orrin have it . He 's the logical choice of the opinion that really , I think , represents a majority of the country . Why should you revive all the bitterness and hatred now ? Have n't we had enough of it in the last couple of months ? Are n't you satisfied ? " He was silent for a moment while all sorts of angrily defensive things came to mind and were rejected . Finally he spoke , more quietly than he had thought he could . " That is n't really very fair . I have n't been satisfied ' with the bitterness . It 's been an inevitable accompaniment of the kind of commitment Harley and Orrin made for us overseas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People are bitter about Panama and Gorotoland . It seems to them to be the Korea-Vietnam pattern all over again . Inevitably it gets into politics . I ca n't help it if those who are bitter want me in the White House . They have to have some hope that things will improve . I ca n't turn my back on them when they believe in me . " " It 's marvelous , " she said in a musing tone that robbed it somewhat of hurt , " how the Jasons can always rationalize what they want to do . As I see it , the convention reached a decision . The bitter people have lost . Why do n't you encourage them to accept it and join ranks with  | the rest ? Why keep trying to split the country apart ? Who does it help , except those who hate America ? " " Ceil , " he said quietly , " now you 're not being rational . I 'm not trying to split the country apart . ' It is split apart . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was silence from Nistazo . " When she spoke it was in a tired and dismissive tone that reawoke all the uncertain terrors that had surrounded him when she fled the convention . " Well . . . I 'm sorry I called . Obviously it 's too late for you to back out now , and obviously you do n't want to . So there 's nothing I can do . Is President Abbott going to support you ? " " I would consider it unlikely , " he said , diverted for a second back to polities ; and then , the terrors breaking through in a way that quite surprised him , self-assured Jason that he was , " Ceil , Ceil ! I wish you were here ! " " So do I , " she said quietly . " But I ca n't , for now . " " What will you do ? " he asked , and his voice was trembling again , though he fought desperately to control it . " Stay down there , or " ? suddenly he sounded desperately unsure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are you ? " " I expect not , " she said , after a moment . " After all , you 're my husband and I love you . " " You do ? " he asked humbly . " I 'm not  --  very sure , right now . " " Let me think a little . I need the quiet . I 'm going to take Trumpet and go riding over the hills this afternoon . Then I may go to the beach for a while with the Macombers . They 're going to be next door all week , so tomorrow I may go again . I 'll read some and rest some . Do n't worry about me . The staff is taking good care of me and the press does n't know I 'm here , so I 'm not being bothered with that . We can just rock along for a while the way we are . It will probably be good for both of us . " " Not for me , " he said , but her response was back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer but the man may profit . And I too . Goodbye , my darling . Have a good lunch to make up for the skimpy breakfast . " " Ceil , " he said , hating himself for asking , but knowing he must , " will you refuse my calls if I try to reach you ? " " Oh , no , " she said quietly . " Never . Call whenever you want to . I 'll be here . " After that , he was not too prepared for his sister when she called five minutes later , bright and ebullient , from Washington . But he decided to talk to her because it would keep him from succumbing to the black melancholy into which Ceil 's call was threatening to plunge him .  | This was a new thing for him . Ceil 's striking blonde beauty and honest personality had meant many things to him over the years , but she had never had this effect on him before . He had always felt that in the last analysis she needed him rather more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . It was odd and unsettling . For this mood Patsy , if not an absolute antidote , was at least a jolt . She was obviously off and running about something . " DARLING , " she said , " you 'll never GUESS what I 'm going to do . " " I do n't dare . " " No , seriously , now , it 's going to be such a help to you . You MUST listen seriously . " " I will , " he said , " but I wo n't promise anything . " But after he heard what she had in mind , he thought for several moments and then told her to go ahead ; an indication , perhaps , that he still was not functioning quite normally , in the aftermath of the strange convention . Left to himself again , he contemplated the cool , dark lawns and the stately trees for a while longer and then tried once more to call Bob Leffingwell , now , presumably , returned to his home in Arlington , Virginia , across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the probable mood of the director of the President 's Commission on Administrative Reform , whom he had last seen three days ago when they had parted in mutual bitterness and dislike . Bob Leffingwell had served him faithfully as campaign manager up to the point when violence got out of hand at the Cow Palace . Then he had resigned without any pretense of concealing his horror and contempt . His next appearance had been on the podium when he had started the convention stampede by nominating President Hudson and taking nearly half the New York delegation with him . This had brought him the automatic condemnation of that professionally liberal world which had endorsed him so vigorously when he and Orrin Knox were having their historic battle over his nomination to be Secretary of State . But it had brought him a strange sort of regeneration in the minds of all those good citizens who felt that his action somehow canceled out his childish and dreadful mistake when he had lied to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about his foolish youthful connections with Communism . Now he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Walter Dobius , The Greatest Publication , Newsweek , the Post , the In-Group Quarterly , the Saturday Review and all their gallant band of brothers . But this was counterbalanced and perhaps outweighed by the sober  | and generally respectful reappraisals that were coming from less partisan and more responsible sources . Bob Leffingwell at the moment , Governor Jason realized , was riding rather high again . He was once more respectable with that great group of independent voters in the center who decide most elections . The man who could persuade him to come over to his side would have gained a powerful asset . Particularly if he were the same man whom Bob Leffingwell had so dramatically repudiated only seventy-six hours ago . At first blush , Ted knew , this would seem to many a strange flip-flop for Bob . But all it required to make it easy , in the sometimes rather fantastic atmosphere of American politics , was the right tone and the right style . Bob could say  --  Ted already had his statement blocked out for him  --  that now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene , he could not in all honesty support Secretary Knox for the Presidential nomination . He could say that his support of President Hudson had been essentially personal ; that he had been further persuaded to support the President by the unfortunate trend to violence that the Jason campaign had seemed to be taking ; that he now had the personal assurance of Governor Jason that this trend had developed without the Governor 's knowledge or approval and would not occur again ; and that he accordingly could now with a clear conscience return to support of the Governor , whose policies of sober negotiation and peaceful compromise in foreign affairs were , and always had been , much more satisfactory than the dangerous and ill-advised military adventures of Secretary Knox . It could be done , and easily , and out of it Bob Leffingwell could hold his new-found conservative support and at the same time regain the support of his temporarily hostile friends of the professionally liberal persuasion . He could appear to be an honestly troubled man who was now confronted with the opportunity to reassess his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his present state of mind . A humble and apologetic call from the Governor might be just what was needed to bring him over . Somehow Ted had to find him . When the phone rang ten times without answer in Arlington , he hung up ; but five minutes later he called the switchboard and gave instructions that the number was to be tried every half hour until he said to stop . I am probably , Bob Leffingwell thought , one of the few people in the Potomac basin at this moment who are foolish enough to sit outside ; but his lawn , too , was green and shaded , and the tulip trees and dogwood  | gave it an illusion of coolness . At least it was cooler than the city across the river that shimmered and danced before him , seeming to expand and contract and expand again , as he sat staring at it thoughtfully from a chaise longue by the pool . Washington almost seemed to float suspended in the haze , evanescent , mysterious , perhaps an illusion , perhaps not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolved around it . For a moment he was amused by the conceit , but then it seemed to him that it was almost no conceit at all but the reality . What a mirage it was , that city , and how feverishly it could be conquered or changed or shattered or rebuilt in the hectic imaginings of those who sought in it their fame and fortune . Was it really that all-dominating , really that all-important ? Was n't it perhaps something that was created at embassy receptions , in parties at Dolly Munson 's , in Press Club gossip , in the endless arguments of Capitol Hill that changed but never changed , in the endless jockeying for position , political or social or financial , that occupied the waking energies , the dreams , the hopes and the substance of many fiercely brilliant and ambitious people ? Where did illusion end and reality begin in the Washington he knew  --  not the Washington of the dark streets and the steadily rising crime rate and the poverty and the drudgery and the ugliness and the filth , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave form to the shining ideals and worried hopes of a confused , uncertain , basically decent and still goodhearted people ? Was it reality now , that his telephone should be ringing , and that he should have a pretty good idea of who was trying to reach him ? Was that the sort of reality that mattered to the black families on the dirty streets tucked away behind the magnificent avenues , was that what the knifer or the robber or the rapist thought about as he moved through Rock Creek Park or Capitol Hill or along the Tidal Basin in search of the unwary and the unattended , was that the kind of reality they were concerned about in Lafayette Park ? Or was it just a reality that existed in some precious , fragile world somewhere on some special Cloud 9 , kept up there by an exercise in mass illusion on the part of all the people who knew their dream-city had to be kept suspended in the air because they would all fall with it if it were not ? He sighed and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities were one . The Cabinet member who dined at Dolly 's tonight could be called away by a telephone call concerning the latest racial riot , the shadows that drifted through the parks could be rescued or driven into the ground by what they might decide in Congress , the lovely homes in Georgetown and other gracious places would stand  | solid on their foundations only as long as those who lived in the dirty streets and alleys could be convinced that someone was actively trying to help them . The illusionists could keep their shining city aloft only as long as the realists found their ugly one getting better . And salvation in the ugly city depended , whether its residents knew it or not , upon the decisions of those who walked the shining streets . They were locked in dreadful embrace and neither could be free of the other . Of course it mattered to all of them who were calling Bob Leffingwell on the telephone . It might very well be the next President of the United States , and in a thousand ways subtle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of their days by who he was and what he did . But for all that , Bob Leffingwell had no intention at the moment of answering the persistent ringing that came at regular intervals faintly from the house . Whether it be Governor Jason or Secretary Knox or the shrewd old Congressional veteran who now had the power , he just did n't have much stomach for a long , exhausting conversation with any of them . He was aware of his own advantages at the moment , and the longer he kept himself secluded and aloof , the stronger they would become . There was no reason to get involved sooner than he had to . In a sense there was no reason to get involved at all . Direct participation in politics had not been Robert A. Leffingwell 's habit . At least , he reflected with a cynicism to match theirs , that was the reputation carefully built up for him over two decades by all his powerful friends of the communications world who had done so much for his career up to three days ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How savagely they were howling for his scalp ! Or rather , how smoothly and suavely , not howling , not raising their voices , just turning the knife and using the nasty phrase , were they scientifically trying to destroy him . Just today , for instance , he had seen Newsweek 's final convention issue . It had contained a boxed insert , " The Strange Case of Robert A. Leffingwell , " which was a classic of its kind . Puzzled , concerned , wistfully sad and determinedly damaging , it had said in part : " Minor highlight ( Minor ? Bob Leffingwell thought dryly . When I was the one who started the real stampede to Harley ? ) of an already chaotic convention came when Leffingwell , up to that moment apparently an enthusiastic supporter of Ted Jason , abruptly abandoned him to lead nearly half the New York delegation into the Hudson camp . Explanation for the strange switch by Bob Leffingwell  --  who lost the Secretaryship of State a year ago because his veracity about a youthful Communist fling proved unequal to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  was perhaps best summed up by one disillusioned liberal delegate . ( ' Unidentified , ' Bob Leffingwell remarked aloud . Description supplied by me . ' ) This observer , who had watched the Leffingwell career with undisguised admiration for twenty years , was heard to remark glumly : Apparently the White House can outpromise anybody . ' Best guess on the new Leffingwell job : director of foreign aid , not too far from the State Department he could have had if it had n't been for those little red lies . " One week before , when he had been managing the campaign of Ted Jason , who represented an anti-war position harshly critical of the United States Government , the story had been different : " One of the major elements in the Jason convention drive this week was the brilliant leadership provided by Robert A. Leffingwell , long an unimpeachable liberal of the finest type . Aided by a staff as dedicated and selfless as himself , Bob Leffingwell 's skill and integrity appeared to be pushing the Governor into a well-nigh insurmountable lead .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the media , he thought with a genuine contempt . How obvious to everyone but themselves , in their ideological enthusiasms , their switches , their twitches , their self-centered , self-interested hating and loving that colored everything they wrote and broadcast . How pathetic , really : for they were heirs of a great tradition who did not have the integrity to keep it pure . Whether they were really hurting him , he could not assess accurately at the moment . He rather thought not , because aside from that small but powerful clique , a different tone was beginning to come into the press . What he had done a year ago was at last being put into perspective . He was being , finally , forgiven . Not that he could ever forgive himself , of course , for lying to the Foreign Relations Committee ; and not that any perspective could ever erase from his mind and heart the wound he had given himself when he let desire for the office of Secretary of State override his natural decencies . But at least , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , in this age of mirrors , was n't that all that mattered ? After a moment he told himself with a little smile that this was too cynical . His desire to become Secretary of State , after all , had included a purpose . It was far more than ambition for office . He honestly did believe that he could negotiate with the Communists in such a way as to encourage peace  --  or whatever that uneasy state of non-fighting accommodation might be that the world could accept as peace in this unhappy century . He honestly did feel that he could help to save Amer-  | ica from disasters he believed a more belligerent policy would bring about . Like so many who meet head-on in the never-ending struggle to determine who will control the great republic 's destinies , he was as convinced of his righteousness and idealism as his opponents were of theirs . And yet he had nominated Harley Hudson , the man who had met Communist imperialism as staunchly as a Truman by sending troops into Gorotoland and Panama the moment the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great agonized howl that had ascended and was still wailing up from campuses , churches , ad-takers in the New York Times , marchers , demonstrators , emergency committees , professional peace-lovers and the world of Walter Dobius , and had supported the man they so violently and viciously opposed . He had deliberately invited their violence and viciousness upon himself . Why ? Granting that motives were mixed and many , and in Washington triply so , he supposed that basically it must have been because he was grateful to Harley Hudson for saving him from the depths of his defeat by the Senate for Secretary of State . Harley had created the President 's Commission on Administrative Reform and put him at the head of it , and the process of recovery had begun . In return he had given good service in the past year , recommending many reforms in the Executive Branch and being fortunate enough to see one or two of them adopted by Congress . Cautiously he had begun to venture out again in the world of ideas , writing a few articles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news media had come to his support , rapidly they had begun to rebuild his shattered reputation . While deploring his judgment in lying to the Senate , they had nonetheless stoutly defended his basic good character and his long liberal record . And then , in their grossly slanted and bitterly unfair coverage of the wars in Gorotoland and Panama , they had set out to destroy the man who had saved him . This more than anything , he felt now , had probably inspired his backing of President Hudson . That , and perhaps dislike of Governor Jason . He had accepted the chairmanship of Ted 's campaign with serious misgivings , and only because Harley up to the last moment had maintained that he would not run . In a series of moves , all shrewdly conceived and cleverly timed , Ted had laid claim upon the liberal position . It had been an easy game , the kind a man who has no responsibility and great ambition can always play with a busy and preoccupied President who has the world on his shoulders . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry wasp , stinging at will .  | Did Harley take a position on some major issue ? Ted could always make a speech taking one a little more extreme . Did Harley act honestly on the basis of the facts as he knew them ? Ted could always rise with a high moral indignation to demand that he do something else . Did Harley have to balance every word and move against all his national and global responsibilities ? Ted only had to go on " Meet the Press " and make fine , free-swinging generalizations that hinted ominous things about the President and glorious things about himself . It was all very easy for a man unscrupulous enough and rich enough and irresponsible enough ; and Ted had turned out to be all three . As a result , powerful publications and commentators had flocked to his side and dutifully given him the Big Build-up they always give any Presidential candidate they have decided to support . Bob Leffingwell had soon found what he had suspected all along , that behind the smiling candidate there lay a ruthless ego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on the brakes . " The Shame of The Convention , " the Wall Street Journal had called the political violence that had broken out among the Jason forces ; and Bob had seen Ted allow the violence to begin and then to grow to the point where it became a monster almost uncontrollable . At that point he had left . And so the deluge of vituperation pouring on Harley had inundated him . On one point , however , he felt that he was unassailably consistent ; he had not endorsed Orrin Knox for Vice President , and indeed had withheld his vote in the final , halfhearted ballot that had confirmed Orrin 's nomination . His loyalty had been to Harley only , and he had left San Francisco not knowing whether he would be able to actively support the ticket . No man had been more responsible than Orrin , then senior Senator from Illinois , in rallying the Senate to defeat the Leffingwell nomination . He had long ago conceded Orrin 's sincerity in the matter , but that did not make it any easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would probably never do . So now , he told himself quizzically as he stood up with a restive air and walked to the edge of the pool , he had a problem . He took a deep breath and dived in ; swam the length of the pool underwater ; came up , took another deep breath , plunged under and swam back . He surfaced , puffing and blowing , and climbed out . Helen-Anne Carrew stared at him blandly from the chaise longue . " Oh , hi , " he said , drawing up another from under the trees . " I did n't hear you arrive . How about a drink ? " " Gin and tonic will do , " she said , and looked pointedly at the house . " Nobody home ? " " Just us squirrels and cardinals , " he said pleasantly . " And do n't be so  | subtle . I 'll be right back . . . . Now , " he said , stretching out comfortably and giving her an appraising glance , " what 's on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerfully , " an old harridan like me has nothing on her mind but news , news , news . I must say you do mix a good drink . What are you going to do about its " " Nobody can ruin gin and tonic , " he said comfortably ; and then grinned at her expectant expression . " Which it ' of the many one must do something about are you referring to ? " " Well , " she said , " there is , A , an empty house , and , B , a Presidential nomination ? " " Oh , those , " he said with an elaborate yawn . " I thought you meant something really important , such as your distinguished ex-husband 's column this morning . " " Walter Dobius , " she said firmly , " is out of his mind . Ignore him . " " How can we ? " he asked , making a sweeping , ironic gesture with his glass toward shimmering Washington . " Everybody but everybody listens to Walter . " " Trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? " He shrugged . " I 'm here to find out if you 're going to go , " she said . " Three people I thought I 'd check on today . One is Ceil and one is Lucille Hudson and the third is you . If I can pin you all down I 'll have a hell of a column for the dear old Washington Star . " He smiled . " Any luck ? " " Ceil is charming and evasive . She did talk to me , because she said I was the only reporter with brains enough to figure out where she was , but that 's about all she said . I do n't know what the situation is in that household . Any more , " she added blandly , " than I know what it is in this one . " " Louise is in New Hampshire at Lake Chocorua , " he said with an equal blandness . " I thought you knew . " " Mmmm-hmmm . " " And of course you ca n't reach Lucille . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The White House is tighter than a drum , naturally . " A sad expression touched her face . " You know , this thing is really awful . Really awful . Poor Harley , and all those innocent people ? " He frowned . " Were they ? All ? " " I do n't know , " she said , frowning too . " Lots of rumors going around , of course . "  | He nodded with some distaste . " I can smell them clear across the river . " " Me , too . There was something fishy . That plane has made ten thousand trips and never had any trouble . Why did it go down with Harley , and just at this particular time ? " " Unanswered questions , " he said , " to echo down the centuries along with the others . The Presidential Mysteries . . . . Well , if Cell wo n't talk and you ca n't reach the First Lady , what are you going to do ? " " Lover , " she said with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you under water until you tell Helen-Anne everything . First of all , about your wife ? " " Louise is very doctrinaire , " he said calmly . " She always has been . She was an intense little girl when I married her and she 's intense still . You have to see that sort growing up , from campus to committee to cause , to know what I mean , but there is a certain absolutely humorless type . She 's it . It goes with rimless glasses , no make-up , and the hair in a very tight bun . She 's gone away because she was bitterly opposed to Harley Hudson and everything he stood for , and I nominated him . She called me Tuesday night in San Francisco and threatened to leave if I did . I did , and she has . That 's all there is to that , and I 'll trust you not to print a word of it , thank you very much . " " No , " she said slowly , " I suppose I 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you want . " " I do n't know what I want , " he said . " At the moment , it does n't mean anything to me . I could n't care less . She 's gone , so what . That 's about the way I feel right now . " " Will she file for divorce ? " He shrugged . " I do n't know . I doubt it , at least not until the season 's over at Chocorua . She enjoys that cabin . " " That 's a bitter thing to say , " Helen-Anne told him . He shrugged again . " Absolutely dispassionate , I assure you . Now , about the Presidential nomination ? " " Yes , " she said , " do let 's get back to the Presidential nomination . First , let me mix you a drink , this time . " " OK , " he said , handing her his glass . " This will be the final , for now . " " Me , too , I 've got to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is everything where I can find it ? " " It 's all beside the sink , " he said , yawning and rubbing the back of his neck . Two cardinals flew by , busy ; a squirrel pranced ; the world drowsed.  | " God , " Helen-Anne said , handing him his drink , " am I sick to death of Jason$ ! Except Ceil , of course . She 's a great lady . " " She 's wonderful , " he agreed . She gave him a shrewd look . " So are you going to support her husband for President ? " " Helen-Anne , " he said soberly , " to tell you the truth , I really do n't know . " " Orrin 's the better man . " " Yes , " he said with a smile . We all know how you feel about Orrin . Anyway , who cares what I do ? I thought , " he said , his eyes narrowing with pain as he remembered the violent cries of " Liar ! " that had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that Mary Buttner Baffleburg pretty well took care of me at the convention . " " Mary Baffleburg is an overstuffed Pennsylvania Dutch sausage . " " But she 's going to have a vote for President when the Committee meets , is n't she ? " " Perhaps . We do n't know yet how the Speaker  --  the President  --  is going to handle it . Anyway , do n't downgrade yourself . You 're in a good spot . They 'd both love to have you on their side . You 'd take the conservatives to Ted and the genuine liberals to Orrin . " " What a political hermaphrodite ! Not many heterosexuals can make this claim . " " OK , joke , " she said , " but I 'm telling you the situation . Have n't they been trying to reach you ? " " The phone 's been ringing , off and on . I have n't been answering . " " My , " she remarked , " are n't we high and mighty , for a ? " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bob Leffingwell , " she said sharply , " will you stop beating yourself over the head with that ? It 's all over . The situation has changed . You 've been forgiven , to a considerable extent , so stop dramatizing yourself . Life 's moving on . Get with it . . . . What I started to say , " she added , more mildly , " was that you were rather high and mighty for a political has-been  --  and then I was going to say that really you are n't a political has-been  --  and then I was going to say  --  oh , the hell with it . If you want to sit here by your pool and feel sorry for yourself , God bless you . I 've got better things to do . " And picking up her enormous handbag , from which a conglomeration of note paper , press releases and several sections of the Sunday New York Times threatened to spill , she stood up abruptly . But he waved her down again . " Helen-Anne , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're about the  | only person I know in this town at the moment who is capable of giving me honest advice . What do you think I ought to do ? " " Well , " she said , subsiding with some reluctance , " I do have better things to do than nurse wounded egos , I can tell you that . Helen-Anne is a busy girl , right now . What I think you should do is go and talk to Orrin Knox , if you want my frank opinion . God knows you 've talked to Ted enough , but I 'll bet you never have talked to Orrin  --  really talked to him , I mean . " " Our relations , over the years , " he said with a certain wryness , " have hardly been such as to induce any boyish confidences . Before I was " ? and even now , a year later , he hesitated painfully over the word ? " nominated , I did n't have much occasion to see him , except at a few cocktail parties around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really did n't have much opportunity for a cozy chat . And since then .. . No , " he agreed thoughtfully , his eyes far away as he stared at the distant dome of the Capitol , riding like a galleon through the gentle haze , " I never have really talked to Orrin Knox . " " My advice to you is , do it , " she said bluntly . " Unless , of course , you 're going to go crawling back to Ted . " " No , " he said with a sudden sharp annoyance that made her think perhaps she had gone too far , " I 'm not going to go crawling back to Ted . He 's doing the crawling , if anybody is . They can all come crawling , as far as I 'm concerned ! " " Now you are getting too high and mighty , " she told him soberly , once more gathering up her gear , yanking a comb through her tangled silver-gray hair , rising to her rather dumpy , ungainly stance . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then I think you 'd better start answering the telephone , and then I think you 'd better give some serious thought to going to see a few people . And not in the mood you expressed just now , but with a reasonable degree of humility . Pride and arrogance ruin more people and thwart more plans in this town than anything else , I 've always thought , and you may think you 're humble but you sure as hell do n't sound it . I think you 'd better be , if you really want to contribute anything to getting this God-awful situation straightened out . " She gave him a quick , shrewd look . " I do n't think you 've really learned anything . You just think you have . " For a long moment , staring at her with those handsome gray eyes that always contributed so much to the picture of the very parfit gentil knight of government that his admirers liked to think he was , he said nothing . Then he stood up , smiled , and held out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old friend  --  old buddy  --  aide and adviser through thick and thin ? "  | " Oh , go to hell , " she said , batting aside his hand but beginning to smile in spite of herself . " ? I think you have a point . I really do . I shall treasure it . I shall sit for a while and think  --  no more drinking , though , that might defeat the whole purpose  --  and then I shall go humljy to the telephone and humbly on my rounds , and we shall see what happens . . . . And you , " he added , again offering his hand , which she took this time with a firm pressure , " do n't write one single solitary thing about what I may or may not do , OK ? " " Damn ! " she said . " The stories I 've killed for my country . " " I know it , " he said , quite seriously . " As one American , I appreciate it . " " Now you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't avoid speculating some , sweetie , everybody is . Tell me what the facts are when you can , OK ? " " I will , " he said , taking her arm and walking her around the house to her car . " I 'm sorry I have n't been able to give you more today . " " You 've given me quite a bit . I hope it 's been mutual . " " Oh , it has , " he said , lightly but with a serious note underneath . " It has . I hope you find something for that column . " " It does n't have to be done until tomorrow , but I want to get it out of the way today because there 's a lot of funeral coverage I 'm going to have to help with , starting tomorrow morning . " " I know , " he said , suddenly somber . " Maybe ? " she said , deliberately breaking the mood before it could depress them too much , " Maybe I 'll call Patsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't anything else to write about . " But a few minutes later , when she was back over the river and out southeast in the deserted city room of the Star , she found Patsy singularly uncooperative . " I think you 're working on something , girl , " she told her . Patsy only laughed in a deliberately annoying way and refused to be drawn out , beyond saying in a dreamy voice , " Oh , I might just think of something to liven things up a bit . " But Helen-Anne was not an old hand at the game for nothing . Like any experienced Washington correspondent , she could make bricks without straw when she had to . " In a Washington hushed and saddened by the tragic death of Harley M. Hudson , " she typed swiftly , " politics , as always , takes no holiday . Even as the President 's body was being prepared for formal lying-in-state at the White House Tuesday , and at the Capitol Wednesday morning , speculation was already rife today that Robert A.  | Leffingwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be even more of a key figure in the Presidential nominating yet to come . " Governor Edward M. Jason of California was believed to be trying desperately to reach this glamorous figure , who only three days ago ? " But when Bob Leffingwell , after another dip in the pool and a few more minutes of somber contemplation of the great white city sprawled along the Potomac , went finally to answer the insistent telephone , it was not the Jason he expected who was on the line . " This is Ceil , " she said quietly from California . " I want to give you some advice . " " Lots of people do , " he said , carefully refraining from surprise . " I value yours more than most . Fire away . " " This is Walter , " he said bluntly from " Salubria . " " I want to give you some advice . " " I 'm not in the market , " Governor Jason said coldly from his office in Sacramento . " Why do n't you call me after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Walter Dobius said with a sudden surge of anger . " This is important . " " Everything you say is important , Walter . It 's the one thing we 're all agreed on . " " I think you should call Bob Leffingwell , " Walter said , trying to control his irritation and managing with some difficulty . " I think he may be able to help you . " " It never would have occurred to me , " Ted said in a startled voice . " How 's the third party coming , Walter ? " There was a silence in Leesburg . Finally " America 's greatest philosopher-statesman of the press " ( as the New York Times had called him on the twenty-fifth anniversary of his column a couple of months ago ) spoke in a tightly controlled , level voice . " I would not want you to think , " he said carefully , " that my support or that of any of my colleagues is automatic , Ted . It can always be changed . " The Governor snorted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ted ? " Walter Dobius began with a rising inflection , but the Governor cut him short and it was quite apparent that they now had to deal with a Jason who had recovered and never intended to lose control again . " You have nowhere else to go , Walter , and all of you from Manhattan to the Golden Gate are perfectly aware of it . You are n't going to  | support Orrin . You are going to support me . And on my terms . That 's the fact of it . Right , Walter ? " Again there was silence , broken , the Governor noted with a grim satisfaction , by a little heavy breathing from " Salubria . " At last Walter Dobius spoke in tones even heavier and more pompous than he usually used . " You are insufferable . Absolutely insufferable . " " But the great hope of America and world peace , Walter , " Ted Jason said with a savage irony . " Never forget that . " And hung up , which , in the rarified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do , public speeches that influenced large segments of press and public , and sagely given private advice to kings and potentates who looked to him as perhaps America 's major editorial voice , did not often happen to the man whom Lyndon Johnson had long ago nicknamed " Walter Wonderful . " The conversation only demonstrated , he told himself after his anger had subsided somewhat and he could sit back reflectively once more at the desk from which so many significant words had gone forth to influence the world , what could be expected from a man of the Governor 's devious and unreliable character . Ted had always been too independent . Walter had known in his heart that it was a chancy game to rely upon him , but there had been no alternative to the insanely dangerous war policies of the President and Orrin Knox . At least Governor Jason represented a policy of negotiation and peace ; at least he genuinely did believe in a " new spirit toward the Soviets , " a " detente between East and West , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and all those other phrases , comforting to the timid , however unfounded in fact , which were so beloved of Walter 's world from New York to San Francisco . He was also Governor of the largest state in the Union , which was a rather important factor , too . It was important enough , in fact , so that even Walter and his friends could not very well do anything about it . Like Ted Jason or despise him  --  and some , including Walter , now inclined strongly to the latter ? there he was . A political reality of the highest magnitude , once more in command of himself and the situation which confronted him . To that situation , Walter reflected after a few more moments of calming down , he , Walter , must now apply himself with all the skill and influence he possessed . That this was great and far-reaching , he knew . That it really " controlled " the press , only his more naive countrymen claimed . There were those who , reading some criticism of Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " I just do n't believe that one man could have that much control over the press . " But no intelligent critic , of course , ever claimed that Walter did . Walter was influential because he was a member in high standing of that small group of columnists , commentators , newspapers , magazines and television programs that largely influence and affect the general thinking of the American nation . He did not " control " his peers any more than they controlled him . What he did do , and with great effectiveness , was sometimes to originate , and sometimes to clarify and synthesize , the major ideas and emotions they held in common . Thus a few weeks ago he had called together The Greatest Publication That Ever Was , the Times , the Post , Newsweek , Look , CBS , NBC and a few others , for one of those exchanges of ideas that quite often precede the selection of the Presidential candidate they will all support . In some previous elections this consensus had been reached , not at any formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cocktail party meetings , transcontinental telephone calls , even casual meetings at golf courses , clubs , public events , at which the general desire had gradually been formed and articulated . Walter 's little meeting had probably not been necessary , so deeply committed had they already become to Governor Jason . But he had a sense of neatness that required it ; and , as the general director of the Post remarked dryly afterward to his crony , Associate Supreme Court Justice Thomas Buckmaster Davis , " Walter 's ego needed it , too . " But , as always , he had not " controlled " them . He had simply stated , in the clearest , most powerful and most widely syndicated form , the thoughts and purposes toward which the policy makers were moving within those citadels of journalistic power from which so many decrees and decisions affecting America 's ultimate destiny were handed down to a public apathetic because it was simply so overwhelmed by the furious onward rush of national and world events . " It 's too much for me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more . I just try not to think about it . " So the public , for the most part , accepted what Walter and his world had to tell them , without question and without the native skepticism that in earlier days had been one of the saving strengths of America . Now it was no longer , " Show me ! " and , " Says who ? " Now , Walter sometimes told himself with a superior contempt , it was a blank look , a dull shake of the head , and a Mortimer Snerd-like , " Ddhhhuuuhhh ? Izzatt so ? " which greeted the pronouncements of himself and his friends . It was not surprising if they often had a field day . But this , he knew as he stared out thoughtfully upon the suffocating  | afternoon , rested upon a flimsy basis . You could never , even at this late stage in many decades of conditioning , quite count upon the American majority to be supine and placid . There still were unruly skepticisms that popped up now and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real answers , there still could be an almost atavistic , instinctive throwback to the days of , " Says who ? " And when that happened , Walter and his world were in trouble . Voters did n't vote the way they were sppposed to , the country did n't respond as dutifully as it should to carefully calculated words , photographs , headlines , broadcasts . An old independence could come abruptly and disconcertingly back . So you had to be clever and shrewd and persistent and never , ever , lose sight of the main objective , which was to persuade the country to think and behave the way you , as superior and intelligent beings , knew that it should and must if America was to be saved from her follies and peace was to be secured for the world . How to do this through the medium of Ted Jason was now , once more , the problem . The convention , dominated by Harley Hudson and Orrin Knox , had perhaps been hopeless from the start ( Walter could never admit to himself , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he and they had perhaps been responsible for the growing tension that had finally brought revulsion and cost Ted the nomination ) . But now the crash of Air Force One had given them all a new chance . There must be no slip-ups this time . For all his repulsive independence and disrespect , Ted should and must be the candidate . It must be handled with the greatest astuteness and skill . He could almost have groaned with annoyance and dismay  --  an uncharacteristic " God damn ill " did surprisingly break the muffled silence of the cool , dark study  --  when he saw a car come up the curving drive and stop under the classic white portico . Out of it came the last people on earth he would expect to show astuteness and skill about anything . His first impulse was to call Roosevelt and Arbella on the intercom and tell them to say he was n't home . But then the longtime Washington reporter 's practicality returned . Whatever he thought of them , and however dangerous he thought them to be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt that in Senator Fred Van Ackerman of the Committee on Making Further Offers for a Russian Truce ( COMFORT ) ; LeGage Shelby , director of Defenders of Equality for You ( DEFY ) ; and Rufus Kleinfert , Knight Kommander of the Konference on Efforts to Encourage Patriotism ( KEEP ) , there were represented the three main elements in the country whose strange political  | bedfellowship provided the principal foundation of the Jason campaign . He sighed , braced himself and went slowly down the stairs with a stolid , unhurried dignity and a certain trepidation he would not have cared to admit , to answer Fred Van Ackerman 's imperious knocking . Sometimes she read . Sometimes she dozed . But mostly , as the great house lay silent around her , the former First Lady of the United States thought . Earlier , the White House physician and his soft-spoken young assistant had tried to give her sedatives , but she had refused them , aside from one tranquilizer which had seemed to stop her tendency to burst into tears when she did n't expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by now , so bitterly had she wept most of last night , but all the way across the continent this morning it had welled up again every few minutes . Despite the worried sympathy of Bob and Dolly Munson , she had not been able to stop until just before they landed in Washington to face the barrage of cameras and newsmen . Then the inner iron that lay beneath the pink-cheeked , roly-poly fluffiness had come to her aid and she had managed to get down the steps and into the waiting limousine , with its little fender flags at half-mast , without breaking down again . After that she had been engulfed in a curious , glacial mood that had continued , with one exception , all afternoon . For the most part she had remained in bed in the family quarters on the second floor . But once she had felt an irrational desire to find some old scrapbook , stored , she thought , in a closet on the far side of the mansion . She had slipped out , aided by Dolly , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking . But she had not remained long enough to find it . No sooner had they reached the east wing than they had heard a muffled hammering below . " Oh , of course , " she had said in a distant voice . " We 're over the East Room . They must be setting up the catafalque . " Dolly had caught her just as she started to faint , and when she came to , she was back in bed . That time she had cried again for quite a long time . Finally she had stopped . Now , in a curious in-between world in which she realized but could not realize that her husband was dead , she looked out over the lawns and trees to the Ellipse , the Washington Monument , the slow , lazy river and the gentle rise of Virginia beyond . How many times had she paused to enjoy that view in the year and three months  --  was it really only a year and three months ? ? of her husband 's Presidency . ( She was not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " my husband " or " the President " or " he . " To think or say , " Harley , " would have opened some final chasm of desolation and bereavement she was not yet strong enough to face . ) She could remember their first meal in this house , shortly after seven o'clock on the evening after he had been sworn in , and how tense they were as the full awareness of his awesome new responsibilities had overwhelmed them . But after they had finished and were standing for the first time on the balcony looking out upon this same scene , he had put an arm around her shoulders and given her a sudden squeeze . " Well , Mother , " he had said with a slow smile , " I guess we 're going to find out if a simple , homespun , all-American boy from Grand Rapids can do it , are n't we ? " And abruptly the burden had lifted and she had said , " You know perfectly well he can . I 've never doubted it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , the smile broadening . " Including , I must confess , me . " " Well , I have n't , " she said firmly , and he squeezed her again . " I know . That 's why I do n't feel half as scared right now as I probably ought to " " You wo n't have time to feel scared at all , " she said . " You 'll be too busy . " And so it had come about , for he had been whirled immediately into the Geneva conference with the Russians that his predecessor had agreed to just before his death . And after that crisis there had been a thousand others , major and minor , foreign and domestic , culminating in the crises in Panama and Gorotoland which he had met with unhesitating firmness despite all the voices of anguish , anger and alarm that had welled up against him . Press attacks , television attacks , riots , demonstrations , flag-burnings , draft-dodgings , Congressional hearings , statements , speeches , petitions , full-page ads in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tide of Washington gossip that always attempts to destroy any President who dares do anything counter to what the nation 's self-appointed guardians in their self-righteous wisdom deem best  --  all of these had descended in full measure upon her husband and his Secretary of State . He had worried about it a lot , she knew that ; he had studied and pondered and even , on a good many occasions , prayed . But when his basic decisions were taken , he did not look back . By so much had he grown , in this tragic house that held so much of history ; this unique , mysterious , unknowable domicile that took the men who came to it and transformed them irrevocably into beings far different from what they had been when they entered its doors for the first time as master .  | Master ? No man was ever really master of this house for long . Too many echoes were in the air , too many predecessors looked over his shoulder , too many past decisions kept him company as he faced his dreadful responsibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fearful power that was his to change or initiate events . But before long events regained control and he found he was merely their instrument . He found he must start over , or change course , or do something else than he had at first believed he should  --  and could . Her husband 's predecessor had set in motion certain things : who knew how he would have finished them ? Her husband had to decide , bound by what his predecessor had already done . Her husband had set in motion certain things : who knew how he would have finished them ? His successor would have to decide , bound by what her husband had already done . Certain long-range tendencies appeared in the lives of nations , came to fruition , ran their course , subsided . It did not matter a great deal who attempted to change them along the way : they began , had their time , passed . Presidents , potentates , chairmen of " peoples ' republics , " possessed only the option to decide a few details ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river of history flowed on between the banks predestined by the shortcomings of human nature , and would not be deflected . Thus , no matter who had been in the White House , America would have opposed the imperialistic aggressions of Communism  --  the sheer instinct of national survival , as long as it lasted , would have determined that . It might have been done with more skill in this instance , less grace in that , but it would have been done , and with just about the same blundering , dogged determination . Even Governor Jason , had he ever the chance , would proceed along basically the same lines . Even Governor Jason , the hated and despised , whom she now , in some blind , irrational way that had no foundation in fact so far as she knew , considered responsible for her husband 's death . Ted Jason and all his ambitious , ruthless schemes ... her husband had been right to keep him off the ticket , right to thwart his ambitions , right to shut him out of government . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill Harley . He had helped to kill Harley . And suddenly she began to cry as she had not cried before , silent , wracking , terrible ; knowing , in some dimly grasped way that she had hardly time or ability to understand , in the depths of grief to which she now descended , that when it was over she would do what she could to assure that everything would be the way Harley wanted it . Harley Hudson might be gone but Lucille Hudson was still here ;  | and even as silent weeping gave way to strangled , grotesque , horrible sounds and she bit at a pillow to try to keep them muffled , she understood that she was not going back to Grand Rapids . She was going to stay right here and continue to be a part of Washington for his sake , in any way she could . " Secretary Knox ! " the photographers cried . " Secretary and Mrs. Knox ? Senator  --  could we have you over here , please ? Would you just come over this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do you mind ? " he murmured , looking down at Beth : comfortable , solid , unpretentious , somewhat windblown , obviously tired , but with her keen eyes amused as they so often were by the imperatives of prominence . " Have I ever ? " she inquired with a smile , and suddenly he knew , as he always did when she was with him , that everything was going to be all right . " No , " he said with an answering smile that the Post 's photographer captured , but which was not used . ( " It makes the bastard look too likable ! " the general director protested with a wry chuckle , tossing it into the discard basket and substituting one that made him look worried , disheveled and tense . ) " Very well , " she said . " Strike a pose , Senator . " And so they did , and were photographed standing near the terminal entrance . CANDIDATE AND WIFE , said Life in its next issue . THE EVER-HOPEFULS , said Look . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighboring car almost went off the road . After that they sat back as far as they could and at first were silent . But when they went over the bridge and entered the city , she gave him a thoughtful look and asked with a smile , " How are you bearing up , Mr. Secretary ? All right ? " " I 'm managing , " he said . She squeezed his hand . " That 's good . I 'd hate to think you were being bothered by anything . " " It is damned annoying ? " he began with an explosive emphasis and then stopped with a sudden wry grin . " Hank , " he said , employing the nickname he had first begun to use years ago at the University of Illinois when she was Elizabeth Henry , " this is going to build up into the damnedest foofooraw you ever saw . " " Considering the number of foofooraws you 've been in , " she said , " I find it hard to believe that this is going to be the damnedest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up ? "  | " Just stand by me , " he said , the grin fading . " I expect I 'm going to need it now more than I ever have . " " There 's great doubt as to whether I will , " she said solemnly . " But perhaps if you promise me a job in your new Administration ? " " All right , all right , " he said relaxing into his first moment of genuine amusement since Senator Warren Strickland had called him in Carmel with the news of Harley 's death . " So I 'm sounding stuffy and pompous . Maybe it wo n't be as bad as that . But it 's going to be a hell of a fight . And , Hank " ? and again a somber expression touched his face ? " I 'm getting a little tired of fighting . " " Well , I 'm not , " she said . " Four days at Esme 's place were just what I needed . Particularly since she called this morning and wished you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in genuine surprise . " That I do n't believe . " She chuckled . " Neither did I. But it was a nice gesture . She was very vague about Ted when I asked her . I gathered she had n't been able to reach him . Nor has anyone else . " " He seems to be in touch with the press , " Orrin said dryly . " How are the kids ? " " Feeling better . Crystal 's coming along fine and I think Hal has decided to remain with the human race , after all . The doctors say there can be another baby ? " " No , really ? " he asked delightedly . She nodded and squeezed his hand again . " I thought that might put a spark back in you , Grandpa . Yes , it 's apparently going to be all right , so everybody 's feeling much better . Including Stanley , whom I left in charge , He really does n't want to fight any more . " He nodded . " I ca n't blame him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager . " " Any ideas ? " She gave him a quick glance . " The same one you have , I expect . " " I 'm not sure I want him , " he said slowly . " I 'm not sure it 's going to be conducted in quite the sort of atmosphere in which ? " But even as he spoke the limousine turned and moved into Pennsylvania Avenue toward the White House , and at once they became aware of police , strobe lights , television cameras , shouts and cries , a mass of shifting , surging people . As they came closer they could see  | that its focus was a long line of picketers , young , old , white , black , male , female , bearded , non-bearded , clean , filthy , happily intermingled and swaying in a stomping conga formation along the iron railings in front of the mansion . Its members carried torches and banners which they displayed eagerly for the encouraging cameras ? " GOODBYE , HARLEY , NO MORE WAR ! ... COMFORT SAYS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . KEEP DEMANDS AN IMMEDIATE END TO OVERSEAS ENTANGLEMENTS ! ... END THE WHITE MAN 'S WARI  --  DEFY .... YOU 'RE NEXT , ORRIN  --  ONE DOWN , ONE TO GO ! " And in measured cadence there came clearly through the soft night air the mocking , triumphant chant : Air Force One , What have you done ? Set us free , Tee hee heel " My God , " he said with a disgust so deep he had not known it was still there after all these years of shabby guttersnipe outburst in America , " is there no decency left in this land ? Driver ! Take us into the White House ! " " Mr. Secretary ? " the driver began in alarm , and Beth said , " Orrin ! " But his face set in an implacable mask and he repeated angrily , " Take us on in . Run them down if they do n't give way ! " But fortunately for all concerned , the White House police had seen them coming , recognized the car , and were already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West Gate . Through this the limousine moved swiftly , but not before others recognized them too . Stones , eggs , torches slammed against the car , an angry animal howl followed them up the drive . As they stopped beneath the portico , the chanting line converged into a mass that shoved and pushed against the railings . Wild obscenities shattered the placid evening of Pennsylvania Avenue ; not for the first time nor the last , but probably never before in such a context . As they looked back from the top of the steps they could see police deployed along the inside of the fence ; see the first clouds of riot gas begin to boil ; hear a single , shattering gunshot , the start and finish of a scream . Dolly Munson met them at the door , her eyes wide with trouble and concern .  | " Get inside , " she said , pulling them in . " For God 's sake , get inside ! " The dream-city and the real city had come together , and the deceptively peaceful mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was peaceful no more .  | TWO HOURS LATER in Spring Valley  --  SECRETARY KNOX BESIEGED IN WHITE HOUSE , ESCAPES THROUGH UNDERGROUND PASSAGE TO EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING , the early editions said . NEGRO DEMONSTRATOR KILLED IN ANTIWAR PROTEST  --  his first at was to mix himself a strong Scotch and soda and take it into the den . He had left Beth at the mansion , helping Dolly and the White House physician calm a Lucille Hudson driven almost hysterical by the noise outside . Six State Department security men had come with him and were now staked out discreetly among the trees and bushes . The neighborhood was silent and apparently deserted as midnight neared , but for all practical purposes he was besieged in his own home , too . He took a deep breath and a deep swallow and put his head back against the well-worn top of the rocker . There he sat for what seemed to him a long time , hardly moving , hardly thinking  --  at least , not coherently , though a thousand things raced back and forth inside his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if there had ever been any doubt that he would continue to seek the nomination , the riot had ended it forever . Those who had conceived the insane idea that such tactics might intimidate Orrin Knox did not know Orrin Knox . Yet why did anyone not know Orrin Knox ? He had been around long enough . It was apparent , however , that this would be a dangerous and possibly bloody business . The violence that had disgraced the convention had not died after all : it had only been sleeping for the past four days . The employment of violence as a political weapon had never been fashionable in America , but increasingly in these last few hectic years the alien idea had been imported that the way to conduct the American democracy was with guns , riots , destruction , assassination . Rioting was no longer the happy , haphazard , idiot-child pastime of looting and burning that had characterized the middle stages of the civil rights campaign . Now it was cold-blooded , deliberate , engaged in by whites and blacks integrated at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public opinion and the intimidation and downfall of government . Riots now were scientific , purposeful , political  --  and to the decent and the stable they were terrifying , because they harnessed  | the animal that crawls from the gutter to the animal that conspires in clandestine rooms . Of course the pretended purposes were still all noble . But the only real purpose was to destroy the Republic , and finally America 's enemies had devised a technique that could really , conceivably , do it . The idea had never succeeded before because those who spawned it had always been alien . Now they had persuaded native-born to do it for them . The two cities were one and might never be separate again . He thought of , Lucille Hudson , widowed at the White House in an accident whose true causes nobody yet knew or would probably ever know ; he thought of Beth , who could be widowed too ; of Crystal and Hal , who had already suffered from the beast let loose ; of all the de1 cent ordinary citizens , unprepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tolerant to respond in kind . And he wondered what would happen to America , and to him , and to all he treasured and had worked so long and hard to maintain . And once again there came into his mind the thought that had struck him a year ago on the night he had been going through such mental tortures over the offer of Harley 's predecessor to back him for President if he would only abandon his opposition to Bob Leffingwell 's nomination to be Secretary of State . He had been wandering beneath the Capitol , on the sloping lawn that leads down from the west front to the Mall , the city , and the White House beyond that he had wanted so much  --  still wanted so much . He had turned and faced the magnificent old jumble . The great dome had loomed above him against the deepening sky , shimmering , perfect , white and pure , over the city , over the nation , over the world . On the Senate side the flag slapped lazily in the gentle breeze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surprising and sudden , tears came into his eyes . O America , he thought , and it was like a crying in his heart : 0 America ! Why do you suffer us your people , who are such fools , and what have we done to deserve you ? Then he had shaken his head with a quick , impatient movement and gone back up the long flight of steps to defeat Robert A. Leffingwell .... And 0 America ! he thought now , and again it was a crying in his heart : 0 my country ! What will become of you in these days when your children hate one another and turn without tolerance and without  | compassion to rend themselves and you in their insane stupidity and spite ? He realized that tears were in his eyes on this occasion too , even as he realized that one of the security men outside was rapping on the kitchen door with the agreed three knocks . He rose somewhat unsteadily and went to answer . For several moments he found it difficult to focus on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Oh , " he said finally . " It 's you . Hqw ironic . I was just thinking of that night  --  I was just thinking of the night I stood on the lawn below the west front  --  and looked at the Capitol  --  and thought about America ? and went back in the chamber  --  and beat you . " " That was quite a night , " Bob Leffingwell said softly ; and held out his hand . " How are you , Orrin ? " " A little shaky , I 'm afraid , " the Secretary said , with a laugh that indicated as much ; and then returned his visitor 's firm grip . " I 'm glad to see you , Bob . I 've been hoping we could meet soon . Come on in the library . I think " ? and again he uttered a rather unsteady little laugh ? " I think we 're relatively safe here . Can I get you something to drink ? " " What are you having ? " Bob Leffingwell asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good , " Orrin said . " Sit down , I 'll be back in a minute . " Left alone in a house to which he had never been invited as guest in all the years of their frequent contention , Bob Leffingwell studied it thoughtfully . It looked as he had known it would : solid , erudite , lived-in , comfortable  --  safe . But nothing was safe on this night , or perhaps ever again in America . He shivered and for a moment he , too , was lost in thought , called back abruptly by his host 's return . Orrin handed him a glass , picked up his own , sat again in the rocker by the empty fireplace . " Did you come by the White House ? " " Yes , it 's quiet , now . Some debris in the gutters , all the floodlights on , eight or ten cops still on duty along the fence , but otherwise calm . The Avenue 's quiet , nobody on the Lafayette Park side . I guess they 've had their fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary 's face . " Oh , the fun 's just beginning . It is n't every day you run to ground a Secretary of State and a candidate for President . I 'm sure we 'll be hearing for the rest of the campaign how I scuttled out with my tail between my legs . But of course it would have been foolhardy to go out the front way . "  | " Foolhardy to go in , " Bob Leffingwell suggested with a smile . " But typical . " " I suddenly got awfully fed up . . . . Your health . " " Yours too , " Bob Leffingwell said , and found somewhat to his surprise that he really meant it . For a moment they drank in silence . The Secretary broke it in a thoughtful tone . " I 've just been sitting here wondering where this country 's going . " " Yes , " Bob said , his face suddenly grim . " You 're not the only one . " " We 've managed to survive an awful lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extra viciousness to it now . For the first time in all my years in public life , I feel our enemies may really have us by the throat . And I 've been thinking whether maybe I 'm to blame , and whether I ought not to get out . " " You were n't to blame at the convention , " Bob Leffingwell said . " You were n't to blame tonight . And you wo n't get out . " " No , " Orrin said slowly , " I wo n't . But I really wonder how much blame I bear for this . Maybe I have n't tried hard enough to see the other point of view . Maybe I 've become as rigid and arbitrary as the professional liberals are . It 's an easy , smug , intolerant state of mind to fall into . Maybe they 've driven me to it in self-defense . . . or maybe I 'm just rationalizing . " His visitor looked thoughtful . " No , I do n't think so . They 've driven me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It cuts both ways . " The Secretary gave him a quizzical glance , half-amused , halfdisbelieving . " I never thought I 'd hear you admit it . " " You probably never thought I 'd be honest enough or perceptive enough to even think it , " Bob Leffingwell said dryly . " I got a pretty clear picture of what you think of me during the State Department nomination . " " Well , " Orrin said , " I believed it to be the correct one at the time . I do n't apologize for it . But people change  --  opinions change  --  certainties change . You 've changed . " He frowned . " I like to think maybe I have , too , I do n't know . " The frown gave way to a wry amusement . " The mellow , aged-in-the-wood Orrin is not visible to a good many of my more violent critics , but he may be there , underneath it all . " " Oh , yes , " Bob agreed . " You 've changed . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly , and for several moments his visitor looked at him with a thorough , analytical gaze .  | " I do n't know yet , " he said slowly . " I really do n't know . Have I changed enough so that you want me to support you ? " " You have politically , " Orrin said promptly , and Bob Leffingwell laughed . " Blunt , candid , **29;82;TOOLONG Orrin Knox ! How else have I changed  --  if at all ? " It was the Secretary 's turn for an analytical gaze . " For one thing , " he said slowly , " we 're both a year and three months older , which should have some effect on a man even at our advanced ages . And for another , I think you have had occasion in the past few months to perceive the nature of some of your journalistic and academic supporters . And for a third , you had the guts to go all out for Harley , and that , in the context of your past life and record and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a hell of a courageous thing to do . I admire you for it very much . " " I got your note at the hotel . I appreciated it ? " " Even though you did think it was all politics . " " I thought there might be a little in it , " Bob Leffingwell confessed wryly , " but even so , I appreciated it . After all , you did put it in writing . Yes , I nominated Harley , bless his heart . Just out of sheer kindness , he did everything he could to salvage my career ? " " And I did everything to destroy it , " Orrin said with calculated bluntness , since he thought he might as well test this new Leffingwell right now . His visitor did not take offense . " No , " he said mildly . " Most of that I did myself , when I lied to the Foreign Relations Committee . " There was a silence in which they could hear a car come along the street ; a sharp challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the sound of the engine dwindling away . At last the Secretary spoke quietly . " A hard word to use about oneself . And a very honorable admission . I respect you for it . " " I do n't say it to everyone , " Bob Leffingwell said with a certain bleakness . " But some people have a right to hear it . You , perhaps , most of all . " He sighed deeply and stared down at his hands . When he spoke again his voice was very low . " You were right to defeat me ... and that , too , you have a right to hear " Again there was a silence , which his host took a long time to terminate . " I think I should be very lucky to have you support me , " he said at last . " And very honored , too . And that I would say , I think you can  | believe me , had you no political influence in the present situation at all . " " Thank you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... I suppose you wonder why I really came here tonight . " Orrin smiled and the tension eased a little . " I 'll admit I 'm a little curious . " " Well , basically , " Bob said in a lighter tone , " I wanted to . But in addition to that , two ladies told me to . " " Oh ? " " One was Helen-Anne ? " " She would , " Orrin said , and they smiled at one another , probably the first genuine smile they had exchanged in several years . " And the other was Ceil Jason . " " Oh ? " Orrin said softly . " Well , I 'm damned . " " Yes , " Bob Leffingwell agreed . " So was I. " " Surely she did n't tell you to support me ? " " She told me to make up my own mind and have the courage to stick to it . Which , I suppose , amounted to the same thing . " " You know , " Orrin said , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a luckier man than he may know . I think she must love him very much . " " Yes , " Bob Leffingwell agreed , " I think she must , though I 'm sure he would n't see it that way . He 'd probably think she was betraying him by trying to get him out of this . " An expression of distaste crossed his face . " More fool , he . " Orrin looked amused . " You do n't think too much of our great governor , do you ? " " He 's an odd duck , " Bob said thoughtfully . " In some ways , a very brilliant man  --  mentally , and in his grasp of detail , and his decisiveness , and his general approach to things . I do n't think he has much heart , to use a tired cliche  --  there 's too much that 's cold and calculating underneath . " " But Ceil loves him . " " Apparently . " " So he must have something . " " Oh , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a most competent gentleman  --  and a most formidable opponent , I think , even now , even with the last five sorry days , even with his insane flirting with violence which drove me away , and has lost him a lot . " " He 'll regain it , " Orrin said tartly . " He 's regained it already . The public 's attention span is about ten minutes . They 're already forgetting the shabby side of it . Harley 's death has wiped out many things . Ted 's  | on the upswing again  --  formidable , as you say . So , are you going to support him , then , if you wo n't support me ? After all , he stands for negotiation and short-of-war and **34;113;TOOLONG . You like that , I take it . " For a moment Bob Leffingwell looked at him with a real hostility reviving in his eyes . Then he shrugged . " The Knox technique , I know it well  --  I ought to know it well . Challenge a man , throw ideas at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a little , see how he reacts , move from there . " He smiled , a trifle grimly . " You ca n't do it to me any more , Orrin : I 've recovered . I recovered a little while ago , when I told you you were right to defeat me . From here on , I 'm on the upswing too . Now , first of all , who said I was n't going to support you ? " The Secretary gave him a shrewd look and chuckled . " You did n't say you were . " " That 's right . And I wo n't say it , either , at least not tonight . I may never say it . Then what ? " " Then I should be quite disappointed . Because as I told you  --  after you started your upswing  --  I should be honored to have you . I can , however , get along without you . " " It 's mutual , " Bob Leffingwell said , and the hostility returned and for a moment they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure . It is . You could n't be more right . So starting from that , how do we proceed ? Together ? " " I do n't know yet , " Bob said slowly . " I honestly do n't . About my views , however  --  they can change too , you know . They 're no longer what you 're trying to say they are ; and they are n't with yours , either . There 's an in-between , you know . Everything does n't always have to be absolute . " " Granted , " the Secretary said . " Granted . It does n't have to be absolute until the moment comes when it 's fight or go under . Then it becomes absolute . And all this fuss  --  aside from those , and of course they do exist , who oppose all policy simply because they actually , coldbloodedly wish to destroy the country  --  all this fuss is simply a debate over when the absolute moment comes . Harley and I say  --  said  --  that it was at Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at Point B. Ours was earlier than yours , and thereby hangs the argument . " " I 'm not so sure that the genuine wreckers have n't taken the argument over , " Bob Leffingwell said soberly . " They did at the convention , the way it ended was only a false lull , apparently  --  they did it tonight at the White House  --  who knows where and when they 'll attempt it  | again ? Apparently it could be right here in Spring Valley . Who 's safe now , and where ? " " Then our battle really is cut out for us , is n't it ? " Bob Leffingwell looked grave . " I think so . " " Then join me and help me fight it . " " Not yet . " " Then why did you come here ? " " To begin thinking , " Bob said . He smiled , though this time it cost him an obvious effort . " And to find out if I could bear to talk to you . " The Secretary gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It has n't been a wasted evening , " his visitor said , rising . " I 'll be in touch . " " May I count on that ? " Orrin asked , extending his hand . " You may count on that , " Bob Leffingwell said ; responded with his quick , firm grip ; turned to the door and was gone into the ominous night , escorted by a security man to his car , which started up quietly and rolled almost apologetically away into the silence of the sleeping neighborhood . " What did he say ? " Beth inquired a few moments later when she called from the White House to say she thought she and Dolly would stay with Lucille , who was finally sleeping . " He said he thought the wreckers were taking over the country . He said he thought the ending of the convention was a false lull . " " I agree . Is he going to help you ? " " He wo n't say yet . I think so . " " I hope so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Keep safe . " " Oh , I will , " he said . " They 've got me under wraps tonight , all right . No wreckers here ! " " And do n't make fun of them , " she said quietly . " They are genuinely terrifying people . " And so the master of " Salubria , " too , was beginning to regard them , as he reflected upon their heated conference earlier in the day , and its immediate result at the White House this evening . It had been the fashion of Walter 's world to regard Fred Van Ackerman as a boorish but occasionally useful demagogue of the irresponsible left ; LeGage Shelby as a clever , ruthless Negro leader who might be teetering on the edge of fanaticism but could be trusted to have enough brains not to fall over ; and Rufus Kleinfert as a clod . It had been comfortable and convenient for Walter and his friends to regard  | these three and their respective organizations  --  the so-called peace movement represented by Senator Van Ackerman 's Committee on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil rights movement represented by ' Gage Shelby 's Defenders of Equality for You , and the so-called superpatriotic movement represented by Rufus Kleinfert 's Kouncil on Efforts to Encourage Patriotism  --  as rather absurd but politically convenient manifestations that could be easily manipulated in the interests of certain cairdidates and certain causes . The members of Walter 's world , in short , had patronized COMFORT , DEFY and KEEP in exactly the fashion they patronized everybody else . They had patronized them thus , in fact , until the three organizations , having coalesced behind Governor Jason ( which was all right ) , suddenly joined in the move to throw the convention into tension and turmoil ( which was not all right ) . Then it finally dawned on Walter and his friends that COMFORT , DEFY and KEEP , like many another package of human dynamite they had played with loosely over the years , really did have a fuse and really could explode in sudden , mindless and terrifyingly uncontrollable ways . In the opening hours of the convention there had been many comfortable , self-satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the idealists , fools , appeasers and Communists of COMFORT , the sick black racists of DEFY and the blind antediluvian isolationists of KEEP could logically unite behind the candidacy of the man Walter 's world wanted to see in the White House . But that had been when Walter 's world was still assuming that the three organizations and all who supported them throughout the country would be well-mannered and well-behaved  --  that they would throw the fear of God into Harley Hudson and Orrin Knox and the stupid conservatives who supported their stupid stand-firm policies  --  that they would not do anything to affront the vast middle reaches of the electorate upon whom the results of Presidential contests depend . It was assumed that they would threaten violence , disruption and chaos , but that they would not take themselves any more seriously than Walter and his friends did . It was assumed that they would not do anything which would really endanger the stability and security of the republic . Suddenly none of this was true any more . Out of the convention political , nihilistic terror-for-terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little late  --  too late , perhaps  --  Walter 's world had become worried and to a considerable extent frightened of the monster whose parturition they had attended and encouraged with their bland editorials and commentaries , their smooth rationalizations , their suavely  | irresponsible justifications . They had presided step-by-step at the birth of terror  --  until suddenly terror was delivered full-grown and out of control . So now Walter 's world was uneasy and afraid , and so was Walter himself . Yet he had gone down to let Fred and ' Gage and Rufus into his house with some of the patronizing mood still lingering . However concerned some of his colleagues seemed to be , Walter felt that he could still handle it , and he felt that his columns were sufficiently strong and influential so that he still had some bargaining power . It had not taken long to disabuse him of that . " Well , Walter buddy , " Senator Van Ackerman had said with that fleering , unctuous familiarity he liked to use when he was driving someone to the wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay it on the line for the greatest governor any state ever had , is n't it ? Time to get in there and pitch , Walter boy . " " If you will come in and sit down , " Walter said , turning away with dignity , " perhaps we can discuss it . " And when they were in the living room , with a pointed courtesy , " Would you like a drink , Mr. Shelby ? Mr. Kleinfert ? " " I neffer drink , " Rufus Kleinfert said with a disapproving stare , his trace of accent at its stiffest and most pronounced . LeGage simply looked ominously impassive and shook his head without the courtesy of speech . " Guess that leaves me , Walter , " Fred Van Ackerman said , enjoying it . " I 'll have a vodka gimlet , thank you very much . " " I have n't got any vodka , " Walter said , and took some small satisfaction from that though he suspected the satisfaction was rather pathetic and despised himself for it . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Period , " Fred said , with a cheerfully unpleasant smile , sitting down with the unerring instinct of a cat in Walter 's favorite chair . " Which I intend to have myself , " Walter said ; rang for Roosevelt , gave the order and then took a seat somewhat uncomfortably on the sofa . " Now , " he said , spreading his hands on his knees in his characteristic gesture , " why are you here and what do you want ? " " We 're here , " ' Gage Shelby said coldly , " because we 're going all out to get that nomination for Jason and we expect your help . " " Yens , " Rufus Kleinfert said softly . " We expekt it . " " What makes you think , " Walter asked with a coldness to match LeGage , a softness to match Rufus , " that my help will be withheld from the candidacy I deem best for the country ? Who launched that  | candidacy in the first place ? I did , with my speech in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary for you three to come to me like a delegation from the Mafia and try to put pressure on me ? Who do you think , " he said , even more coldly and softly , " you are ? " " Temper , Walter buddy , temper ! " Fred Van Ackerman said with his relishing , insincere humor , but neither of his companions looked at all amused . " Unless that man is nominated , " LeGage Shelby said somberly , " there 's going to be blood in this God-damned worthless country . I 'm telling you that for a fact . There 's going to be blood . " " There already has been blood , " Walter snapped . " Crystal Knox 's blood , at the convention , and it cost him the nomination then , you and your damned vicious interlopers ! You destroyed his chances once , what are you going to do , destroy them again ? " " Now , that 's exactly ? " ' Gage Shelby began , leaping up in some obscure , inarticulate excitement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly what you white bastards always try to do , you always try to shut us off , you always try to keep us quiet , you always  --  you al-ways ? " " Sit down , " Walter said in an icy tone , " and be quiet ! I am not trying to do anything but inject a little sanity into your heads . Violence does n't work in America ? " " And do n't give me any of your pious , pompous lectures about violence ! " ' Gage shouted , while Fred studied him with a placid interest and Rufus Kleinfert sat , as always , like a large wax lump . " Do n't try to tell me , white man ! Your days are numbered in this God-damned worthless country ? " " As worthless as you make it , " Walter snapped , trembling with rage himself but trying hard to hide it and succeeding fairly well . " Now , sit down or get out of my house . " For a long moment LeGage stared at him like some quivering panther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose nature no one could foresee , Senator Van Ackerman spoke . " Sit down , boy , " he said with a lazy , deliberate brutality . " Just sit down and stop spilling those grits and chitterlings all over the place . " " You ! r " Gage cried , diverted and if possible even more infuriated . " You , you empty bastard ! I told you never to boy ' me again ! You hear ? " he demanded , so angry he was almost crying . " You hear , you hear ? " " Yes , I hear , " Fred said with a contemptuous calm . " So , Walter buddy , " he said , turning back to their host with a dismissal so abrupt  | and complete that it was , in its way , as terrifying as ' Gage 's violent rage , " you 're going to write some more of those swinging columns and help put Ted over the top at the National Committee meeting , right ? " " I am going to do whatever I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing hard but managing to speak in a reasonably level voice , though it shook a little . " I do not believe that any purpose will be served either with the country or the Committee  --  certainly not with the Committee  --  by threats or acts of violence . I do n't need you to come here and instruct me  --  me , " he repeated , with a rage of his own , " who have been a power in the affairs of this nation for more than twenty-five years  --  on how to conduct myself in this matter . " " No more do we need you to instruct us , Walter boy , " Senator Van Ackerman said swiftly . " So that puts us all on a level , does n't it ? " There was a silence during which LeGage stared out the window at the innocent Blue Ridge with a fearful scowl ; Fred examined their host with a bland innocence ; and Rufus sat like a large wax lump . Finally Walter fell back , with as much dignity as he could manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporter . " What do you intend to do ? " he asked in a tone he tried to make deliberately impersonal . " What can I write about your plans ? " " Oh , no , you do n't ? " ' Gage began with a reviving vehemence but he was stopped by an unexpected comment . " Ve haff , " said Rufus Kleinfert heavily , " our methods . " " That 's right , Walter , " Fred Van Ackerman said . " Ve haff , indeed . And ve do n't want to tip our hands , either , do we , Rufe , old boy ? " " You are not funny , " Rufus said with a ponderous disapproval . " I regret KEEP must work with you . " " But you must , must n't you ? " Senator Van Ackerman asked with his cruel pleasantness . " If it vere not for varrss and more varrss , " Rufus Kleinfert said , " these damnable varrss , ve vould go our own vay . As it iss , ve haff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove us from these foreign entanglements and restore us to traditional Americanism and nonintervention in other people 's quarrels . " " We 're with you there , Rufe , boy , " Fred Van Ackerman said heartily . " That 's what we want every time , traditional Americanism and non-intervention in other people 's varrss . Particularly in Gorotoland and Panama . " " Anywhere , " Rufus Kleinfert said heavily . " Anywhere . " " But particularly Gorotoland and Panama , " Senator Van Ackerman said .  | " That iss where it iss right now , " Rufus Kleinfert said with a shrug . " That iss where ve make our protest . " " And what will this protest be ? " Walter Dobius demanded , suddenly fed up with this by-play among the psychotic . " Another pack of cutthroats like your friends at the convention ? An attempt to assassinate Orrin Knox ? Tell me , " he said with heavy sarcasm . " I may want to write a column . " But these hostile witticisms were not what his guests appreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks , so uniform in their staring , almost childish savagery , that under any other circumstances he would have laughed . Now , for some reason , he did not . " Do n't get too funny , Walter buddy , " Senator Van Ackerman said at last in a softly threatening tone . " Things are going to happen in America that you just do n't dream of in your nice liberal circles . You just think it 's all a nice , sweet little intellectual game , do n't you ? You always have , you and your sweet-smelling friends , playing fast and loose with America just so you could make points at Washington cocktail parties and tell one another in New York how mincy-pincy " ? his mouth curled in a savagely sarcastic and unpleasant fashion ? " just how rootsytootsy , smart-ass brilliant you all are . Well , let me tell you , Walter boy " ? his voice dropped to a menacing quietness ? " let me tell you , things are getting into the hands of the people who really know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd have served your purpose , you 've paved the way , you 've conned the boobs and conditioned them to accept any lie if it 's smooth enough , you 've told them what to believe and made them so confused they do n't know which way is up . You 've done your job , Walter boy : you 've paved the way for us . And now , " he concluded softly , " here  --  we  --  are . " " I think , " Walter Dobius said presently , " that you are all mad ? literally , certifiably insane . " But again he had apparently said the wrong thing , for suddenly LeGage had his arm in a grip so tight that it brought tears to his eyes , and he realized that he  --  he , Walter Dobius , America 's greatest philosopher-statesman of the press  --  was being shaken like a rag doll by the angry young Negro who towered over him . " You just write your columns , white man , " ' Gage said with a terrifying gentleness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just do n't worry about us , if you know what 's good for you . " " Yess , " Rufus Kleinfert agreed with an impassive stare . " That vould be best . " " Because you see , white man , " LeGage said , and suddenly a cigarette lighter had appeared in his free hand , he had snapped it aflame  | and was holding it an inch from the beautiful colonial-style drapes that framed the innocent Blue Ridge , " it is n't just slums that burn down and dirty black people who get killed . Nice homes can burn too , and nice , clean white people can get killed . So you just do your job like we say and we 'll do ours , OK ? " " If you do n't put that lighter out at once , " Walter said , his voice a strange combination of fury and fright , " I shall call the police and have you committed . " " Why , sure , " LeGage said , extinguishing the mechanism and dropping it in his pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But you ca n't stay around and guard the place all the time , can you ? " There was a long silence during which none of them said anything , Senator Van Ackerman staring at him with a brightly interested look , LeGage studying the richly comfortable room with a coolly impersonal thoroughness , Rufus sitting like a large wax lump . Finally Walter spoke , with whatever shreds of self-respect fortified by ego remained to him . " I shall do as I think best about this nomination , " he said , breathing heavily but sounding more like himself again . " It is inevitable , of course , that I shall support Governor Jason . But I shall not do so under threat , and I shall do so in my own time and my own way . And I warn you that if you continue on the path of violence that you started at the convention , you will destroy him and everything you want to achieve , because the heart of America is still strong and decent and a majority of her people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your aim . " " My , my , " Fred Van Ackerman said with a cheerful grin , " if you do n't sound just like Orrin Knox . Come on , fellows , on that note I think we 'd better leave . Semper Fidelis ' is getting so loud I ca n't hear myself think . " And he got up and started for the door without a glance at his host . " Do n't come back , " Walter said coldly as the others did the same . " Only to start a fire , baby , " LeGage said over his shoulder . " If you convince us it 's necessary . " " Yess , " said Rufus Kleinfert . For a good many minutes after Fred had gunned the car down the curving drive and the last traces of its angry sound had died upon the heavy afternoon air , America 's leading philosopher-statesman of the press remained where he was , one hand upon the drapes , staring without really seeing at the lovely rolling countryside that he had so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burdens of guiding his country on her wayward course . Everything in Walter  | Dobius had been affronted in the conversation just closed , his pride , his ego , his intelligence , his wisdom , the integrity of his writing and his work , the love he had  --  perhaps his only conscious love  --  for his beautiful old home . The men who had come to that home this afternoon meant exactly what they said , of that he had no doubt . They were not afraid of violence , they wanted violence , and if he opposed them , they would use violence upon him . A sudden vision of smoke rising from the toppled pillars of " Salubria " made him half cry out in anguish and rage . A moment later  --  for Walter in his own odd way loved his country too ? a wider emotion entered his heart , an even more rending concern . 0 America ! he thought , ironically echoing , though he would never know it , the man he most feared and mistrusted in American politics ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they going to do to you , these dreadful worthless beings ? Now , hours later , after dinner and , for the first time in many years , after a difficult and futile attempt to start a column , he was sitting at his desk coming finally and irrevocably to the conclusion that something more overriding than immediate political concerns must be attended to . He had seen the White House riot on television and it had appalled him . There was no question in his mind that his visitors had gone immediately from " Salubria " to organize it . In quick succession he made two calls to California . The first produced only the bantering disbelief of a candidate obviously unshakable in his conviction that he was once again master of everything , threatened by nothing . Walter did not stay with it long . " You are foolish , " he told Ted Jason bluntly after five minutes of pointless fencing , " and you will know it before long . " " Do n't let it get you down , Walter , " Ted advised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago and I told him to cool it . I said I did n't want their support and would repudiate it outright if there was any more violence such as occurred at the White House . " " Any more ? " ' Walter demanded . " Why do you need any more ? " But the Governor apparently did n't hear that , remarking with some satisfaction , " I made it very clear to him , I think . " " Was he impressed ? " Walter asked dryly . Ted gave a confident little laugh . " He sounded quite well-behaved . " " Guard yourself , " Walter said solemnly . " Guard all of us . " " My , how scary you sound , " Ted told him in a jocular tone . " Maybe you 'd better write a column . Is n't that how you usually work out your fears and frustrations ? "  | " You are foolish , " Walter repeated , " and you will know it before long . " But of course this produced nothing more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bothering to be courteous about it , because why should he , Ted did n't deserve it , he hung up . Immediately after , he had placed his second call . It had not come through yet , but he was waiting . He thought the chances were reasonably good that it might , though he and the recipient had never been more than arms-length acquaintances , for all that they had spent so many years in Washington running the country together . Down the lake someone was laughing again in the crisp , high air . A late boat or two , port and starboard lights aglow , skimmed the black waters with a muted nighttime roar . There were sounds of distant music , and the babble of parties . Television and radio sets had finally been silenced . Most of Tahoe 's visitors had suffered a surfeit of solemn voices , solemn scenes , funereal music and the long , sad pomp of Presidential mourning . One could absorb only so much of that and then it was time to live again . The pre-interment rites were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not , he suspected now as he sat once more alone in the glider on the porch , have been the wish of Harley Hudson , who had always been the simplest and most unpretentious of men . But it was the self-conscious and perhaps somewhat guilty tribute some of the networks felt they had to pay to a man whom , living , they had more often than not opposed , attacked and generally demeaned with every electronic , photographic and verbal weapon at their command . That their ostentatious solemnities at heart really represented relief rather than regret the President was ironically aware , and he was sure Harley would have been aware of it too . They could have had a good laugh about it , if Harley were here . But of course if he were here , the President would not be , and would n't that be a happy , desirable thing ? He was already looking back wistfully to the day before yesterday as though it were a million years ago . He had managed , by the sheer immovable determination that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain his situation out here and give himself an amazing degree of privacy in which to think and plan ; but it was a fragile refuge and he knew it would last very little longer . He must go back , and speedily . Events of recent hours had decided that . Like many responsible men on this deeply disturbing night , he wondered what would happen to his country , and wondered with an extra gavity that no other man could have since his was the power and  | responsibility to meet whatever came . William Abbott was not a man to be stampeded by events , but it was very clear that there would be demanded of him , in many areas , much more than the Administra1 tion 's opponents sought to restrict him to when they used the patroniz- ! ing and detractive term , " the Caretaker President " The phrase was a deliberate attempt to hedge him about psychologically in the minds of his countrymen and sharply narrow his range of action . It would take more than that to do it , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his responsibilities , which he most certainly did not , events had already proved they would not permit it . Shortly after talking to Lucille , which he had done as soon as she had been sufficiently calmed after the riot , he had decided to fly from Reno at eight A.M. tomorrow . His first impulse had been to switch on the intercom to the press cabin and make the announcement himself , for whatever drama it might give the weary crew who were trying so desperately to extract the last ounce of news from their Tahoe vigil . Then a sudden self-protective caution , such as he had never known before but which was to accompany him now wherever he went , stopped his hand . Ten minutes later the Press Secretary was announcing to the poker players , the late story writers and the casually drinking gossipers , that they could look forward to a departure from Tahoe at nine A.M. They would fly from Sacramento at noon , the secretary said , shaking his head with a blandly significant leer when besieged with the excited assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of California . Meanwhile the President was arranging with the Secret Service and the Secretary of Defense to be taken by casually disguised motor launch to the north shore , and from there to Reno , where he would depart at eight A.M. " Me and Abe Lincoln , " he remarked with a wry distaste to the Secretary as their conversation concluded . " We have to sneak into Washington by the back door . " But that , at the moment , was the more sensible part of valor ; and while he had always been a brave man , with that pragmatic acceptance of risk that goes with public life under the best of conditions , there was no point in being a fool right now . Fools of a more sinister kind were abroad in the land , and there was no predicting what new t insanity they might produce if given the opportunity . There were necessary risks and needless risks , and perhaps at this particular moment announcing his routes and times too explicitly was one of the latter . He did not like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to calm down a little . When this would be , he had no idea . From the detailed reports of  | the riot which he had received an hour ago , it was quite apparent that an organized attempt was under way to intimidate and frighten those who carried the burden of the wars in Panama and Gorotoland . If it followed the growing pattern of political violence in America , there would be well-coordinated flare-ups all over the country , in major cities , at national monuments , wherever leading members of the Administration appeared , wherever there was a public event that carried with it sufficient press and television coverage to make a demonstration worthwhile . And if there was no excuse for a riot , well-trained and well-organized anarchists would create one : those who wished to destroy America were adept at it . The White House tonight was only a beginning . The next few weeks would be full of it , and along with it would go an increasingly ugly note of personal threat to every individual and every institution in any way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment , attacking the Administration 's policies was the surest way to attack America . He was struck again , as he had been so often in recent decades , with the sheer mindless virulence of the destructive forces of the world . Never once in all his memory had the Communists and their errand boys made a genuine effort to better the conditions of mankind . If the world had a wound , they opened it further ; if the world had an evil , they made it more evil ; if the world faced a potential explosion , they ran toward it , screaming , with dynamite and matches . In their mad dream of empire that could not succeed even if they achieved it  --  for their own actions guaranteed that it would have to rest upon a self-destroying foundation of treachery , terror , hatred and deceit ? they plunged blindly down the corridors of the twentieth century like idiots loose from the keeper . How utterly evil they were  --  how utterly worthless , how utterly pathetic . And how utterly dangerous . And how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friends and followers , who had for so many years blandly dismissed the dangers , suavely rationalized the evil , earnestly and smoothly explained away the evidence of unrelieved viciousness that filled the record of history since 1917 . And how willfully , when not selfinterestedly or traitorously , had they rewritten that history to suit their own naive misconceptions . And how violently and tragically was history at last disabusing them of their determined and pathetic folly . Walter had telephoned him a little while ago , and even before the President had decided grudgingly to accept the call , he had known  | that he was going to be talking to a worried man . Walter had tried to sound unmoved , but it had taken only a moment to detect in that pompous voice a concern much more agitated than the President had ever heard him express . " Mr. President , " he began , " I appreciate your talking to me at this difficult juncture ? " " Always glad to talk to a friend of Harley 's , " the President interrupted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not concerned at present with the late President ? " Walter began sti 11 y , but again the President cut him off . " Perhaps if you 'd shown a more decent concern when he was alive , he would n't be so late . Now , I have n't got all night , Walter ? " " Mr. Sp  --  Mr. President , " Walter said , stumbling over the titles in an agitation he suddenly made no attempt to hide , " please do n't take out your resentments on the . Some other time we can discuss that . I really did not call to bandy words , or annoy you , or complicate your problems . I called you because it seems to me I detect something in the country that you ought to be warned about . " The President snorted . " Glad you detect it , " he remarked with something of the scathing sarcasm that had always made Mr. Speaker such a frightening figure for fledgling Congressmen . " Nice to know it 's beginning to penetrate . " " Fred Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this afternoon , " Walter said with a dogged determination not to be upset or deflected , " and I am very much afraid that they are planning a lot more violence in connection with the nomination and indeed in connection with many aspects of foreign policy . I think you should know about this . So I am calling to tell you . " " Walter ? " the President began , with a real annoyance ; but then his voice dropped and , as if to himself , he asked , " Oh , what 's the use ? What 's the use ? " in a tired , disgusted tone . " I thought you should know this , " Walter repeated in his heaviest , most pompous manner , and after a moment the President sighed and spoke in a more reasonable tone , which relieved Walter somewhat . He knew the President had problems , but this performance was really hard to understand . " I appreciate your calling , " the President said , more quietly . " I 'm sure it must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Administration " ? how easy it was to slip into that locution ? " will do everything it can to keep order . In fact , by God , Walter , we 've got to keep order , "  | " Yes , we have , " Walter agreed solemnly . " The question is whether those who are determined to make trouble can be persuaded to refrain from ? " " What will you do to persuade them ? " the President inquired without letting him finish . " Write a column or two about it ? " " I will , " Walter said seriously . " I think if they can be made to understand that their efforts are unnecessary because the man they support is going to be nominated anyway ? " " Hey , now ! " the President interrupted with an ominous gentleness the House knew well . " Is that a fact ? Did n't know it was that simple , myself . " " I would say that everything points to it . " " Is that a fact . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " surely it is obvious to you that when you recall the convention it will vote overwhelmingly for the man it really wanted . Surely your many years in politics make the situation crystal clear to you . " " Politics are never crystal clear , " the President said . " That 's what makes it all so fascinating . So you think the convention would do a thing like that , do you ? Well , well . " " I am sure of it , " Walter said stiffly , his worries about violence suddenly quite forgotten in the realization that he should be worrying about his candidate instead . What did this wily old man intend , anyway ? " You see , many of us who favor his candidacy  --  many of us who responsibly favor his candidacy  --  are convinced that President Hudson 's unfortunate death provides an opportunity to clear the slate and start over . " " What would you suggest , Walter ? " the President asked , and although for a second the thought crossed Walter 's mind that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did n't matter , the President certainly knew where he stood anyway . " I would end the wars in Gorotoland and Panama at once , " he said bluntly . " Be brave enough to say it was a mistake , and get out . " " That 's clear enough , " the President admitted . " That would be bravery , as you see it . " " The bravery that only the strong can afford , " Walter Dobius said solemnly . " And that 's what Governor Jason would do ? " the President inquired in a musing tone . " Of course I know it is , " he answered himself briskly . " Well , Walter , I 'm afraid I would n't . And for the time being , at least , I 'm the guy who decides , right ? " " Yes , Mr. President , you are , " Walter agreed . " But , " he added with  | the assurance that comes with a quarter-century of talking to Presidents , " I would hope that sober reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessities of world peace require at least some steps in that direction . " " We 're ready to make peace anytime , Walter , " the President remarked mildly . " On our terms . " " Not entirely , " the President said . " Our terms as long as there 's no sign anybody is going to meet us halfway , yes . If they would , I do n't feel so extreme about it . . . right now . " He allowed a silence to lengthen and then added : " Might , though . " " Mr. President ? " Walter began with a sudden determination . And then he too sighed and asked , as if of himself , " What 's the use ? " " What 's that ? " the President asked quickly . " What 's that , Walter ? Do n't want to think I 'm upsetting you , here . But of course you know I do n't have too many optigns . Particularly without word from them ... I tell you what , Walter . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Communists that they negotiate with us ? How 'd you like to propose that they give up and get out ? How 'd you like to tell the world what bastards they are ? Might be a real help to me , Walter , if you would . Might put the whole thing in perspective . Maybe I could even send you over to negotiate with them and tell them in person . Fred and LeGage and Rufus might like to go too . How would that be ? " For a moment Walter did not reply . When he did , it was in a tone of deeply affronted dignity . " Mr. President , " he said with an immense gravity , " I consider this far too serious for simple humor . " " Not simple at all , " the President said . " Not simple at all . I 've always wondered why you folks who tell us what to do should be so afraid to go over and see for yourselves . I 've often wondered why you back away from taking the slaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we make an offer to negotiate . Go on over and find out what you 're talking about , Walter . It would do you good . " " 1 called , " Walter Dobius said with a frigid courtesy , " to do what I conceived to be my duty as a citizen  --  to warn you of threatened violence in the country . I did not call to indulge in games about two most serious world problems . " " You misunderstand me , Walter , " the President said sorrowfully . " Plumb misunderstand me . No games at all . Just trying to get your help in a most difficult situation , that 's all . We leaders need to stand  | together , seems to me . Let me hear from you any time , Walter . Nice of you to call . " " I think you would be flying in the face of manifest national demand , " Walter said in one last desperate , disapproving attempt to bring the conversation back to reality , " if you were to oppose Governor Jason 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be responsible for the risks you might be taking . " " I 'll have to use my judgment on that , " the President said , " just as I will on everything else . I 've inherited quite a basket of eels . Take me a bit to get ' em sorted out . Thanks for the warning about violence , though . I do appreciate your call . I 'll also appreciate anything you can write to help me calm things down . You 've had quite a bit to do with stirring ' em up , Walter . Be nice if you could help quiet ' em down , now . " " I am sorry I have intruded upon you at such a time , " Walter said coldly . " I did so in all sincerity . " " I understand that . Sincere men will be this country 's salvation , Walter . Or its death . Good night . " And he hung up with a contemptuous little smile that might have worried Walter could he have seen it . As it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  with the President for being such an obdurate man , so hostile to everything Walter believed in , so blind to the dangers he might be plunging the country into if he opposed Ted Jason ? with himself for having yielded to the impulse to call him . He had only done so in an attempt to help , and see what good it had done him . He went back to his typewriter and attacked it savagely . There was no question now of the column 's not moving swiftly . " A Chief Executive apparently oblivious to the crisis of violence which gravely threatens the very fabric of the nation , " he wrote , " is apparently going to invite and inflame that crisis by an obdurate refusal to accept the fact that Governor Edward M. Jason is the overwhelming choice for President of all those Americans who believe sincerely in the welfare of their country and the future of world peace . President Abbott , possibly giddy with the new-found power that the death of President Hudson has conferred upon him , is evidently unaware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prompted  --  however unwisely  --  by fears of Jason supporters that the Governor will once again be shunted aside by the conservative prowar faction in the party . Confronted with this deep and obvious threat to the national safety , the President is apparently ? " For some moments after his caller 's portentous tones had faded from his ear , the President remained sitting in the worn old rocker that had  | accommodated his stocky frame so many times during his holidays at his sister 's cabin . He was not so much annoyed with Walter Dobius , and with all those elements whose opinions Walter epitomized , as he was simply and honestly depressed . Walter 's initial impulse had been one of genuine concern for his country ; it had not taken many minutes for it to swing back to concern for his candidate . The way to avoid violence , obviously , was for everyone to give in obediently and accept Ted Jason for President . Otherwise , there would be violence , and God knows it would n't be the fault of Ted Jason 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He uttered a wry , disgusted , impatient sound , expressive of a mood which was not improved when the phone rang again and his secretary informed him that one of his dearest and most annoying problem children , the Hon. J. B. " Jawbone " Swarthman of North Carolina , was calling . " God , what now ? " he demanded in exasperation , and just then the Chairman of the House Fqreign Affairs Committee came on the line and heard it . " Now , Mr. Speaker  --  Mr. President , sir , " he said in his rapid , colloquial , dumb-like-a-fox manner . " Now , Mr. President , you should n't feel that way about me , sir , now you really should n't . Old Jawbone just wants to have a little old chat , Mr. Speaker , Mr. President , sir , and you had n't ought to get that tired old what-in-the-hell tone in your voice about your old friend , Jawbone , now ? " " Jawbone , " he said in a flat voice that he hoped would interrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why , I just thought , Mr. President , sir , " Jawbone said , his voice dropping confidentially , " that you all might like to know how things are going back here at the home place while you all are out there gallivanting around in that rich , rich resort out there , that 's all . I been hearing lots of things since I got back to town yestiddy and I thought you ought to know about ' em , that 's all . Of course , if you 'd rather not ? " " No , no , Jawbone , " the President said , " go right ahead . " " Well , thank you , Mr. President , sir ? " " And you do n't have to sir ' me every minute , " the President told him with some testiness . " And you do n't have to talk corn-pone . You 're a Rhodes scholar and one of the smartest men I know , so just pretend I 'm still Speaker and give it to me straight , OK ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There ! You hear that now , you hear that ? " " Who hears what ? " the President demanded sharply . " Is someone else on the line ? "  | " Oh , no , sir , " Jawbone said hastily . " No , sir , not at all , now . Just Miss Bitty-Bug , she sittin ' right here beside me , Mr. President , you know how she is ? " " Yes , " the President said , wincing as always at Jawbone 's pet name for his wife , " I know how Miss Bitty-Bug is . Why do n't you tell her to go nibble on some other tree and let us talk in peace ? If you really have something to tell me , that is ? " " Now , Mr. President , sir ? " Jawbone began in a shocked voice . " Tell her , " the President ordered sternly . Jawbone clamped a hand over the receiver , there were muffled murmurs . Presently he came back on the line with a vigorous cheerfulness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he announced happily . " You know lil ' of Miss BittyBug , she do n't like to get left out of anything , but she agreed maybe this time I better talk to you alone . Miss Bitty-Bug sends her love . " " You give my love to Miss Bitty-Bug , " the President said dryly . If this were n't the chairman of Foreign Affairs , whose support he needed , and if he were n't President , whose support Jawbone was going to need in his campaign for the Senate seat of the late Seab Cooley , he would have been tempted to tell Jawbone and Miss Bitty-Bug to fly off home and leave him alone . But Jawbone was a good weather vane , among other things . " Now tell me what you hear . " " Well , sir , " Jawbone said , " well , sir , Bill , I been talking to some of these National Committee people , now , and they say , Mr. President , they say , that they really want that old convention there called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. President . Because there 's a feelin ' , Mr. Speaker , Mr. President , sir , just a wee lil ' of teensy feelin ' , that mebbe now things all been cleared away , here , it might , it jes ' might , be time to take another look at that mighty fine Governor of California out there , the Honorable Edward M. Jason . Yes , sir ! " " This would n't be just a lil ' of teensy mite of wishful thinking on your part , would it , Jawbone ? " the President inquired , remembering vividly how the chairman had been one of the leaders in the fight against the Gorotoland resolution , and then had gone on to the convention to give active support to the Jason cause . " No , sir ! " Jawbone declared stoutly . " No , sir , not a-tall , now ! Why , I just been on the phone with some of ' em , Bill , Mr. President , and ? " " Who ? " " Well , sir , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want it to get away , now , I surely would n't want it to get away ? " " This is the President , Jawbone , " he said . " It is n't going to get away . Who was it , Esme Stryke and Roger Croy ? " " Well , sir , " Jawbone exclaimed in a tone of breathless admiration ,  | " well , sir , if you just do n't say the damnedest , if you do n't now , Bill , Mr. Speaker , Mr. President , sir ! It surely was Mrs. Esme Harbellow Stryke , that great distinguished National Committeewoman from California , and it surely was that great distinguished National Committeeman from Oregon , Mr. Roger P. Croy , ex-governor of that great state of our great Northwest ? " " I 'm not a meeting , Jawbone , " the President said . " So it was Esme and Roger  --  and that 's all . " " Oh , yes , sir , " Jawbone confirmed hastily , " but they been in touch , now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why , Esme , she told me she 'd heard from at least ten Committee members this A.M. already , Mr. President , and Roger P. Croy , he said he heard from about ten more , and they all , Mr. President , they all , are in favor of gettin ' together here in D.C. jes ' as soon as they can and then declarin ' the convention reconvened , and have a vote and put Ted Jason on top of that ticket , and go  --  to  --  town ! " " Mmmmhmm , " the President murmured , with a skepticism Jawbone knew from long experience in the , House . " Now , Bill , Mr. President , sir , " he said hastily , " you all mus n't jes ' go Mmmmhmm ' at of Jawbone here . You all mus n't jes ' Mmmhmmm me , Mr. President , sir ! These people , now , Mrs. Esme and Mr. Governor Roger P. Croy , they know what the mood is , Mr. President , they know what the country wants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , have they ? " the President interrupted sharply . " How many ? " " Well , sir , " Jawbone said , and his tone became crafty and uncommunicative , " I could n't rightly say , now , I could n't rightly say , but quite a few , I dare say , quite a few . And they and their friends , now , they do want that of convention called back , Mr. President . I have a feelin ' , now , a distinct feelin ' ? and Miss Bitty-Bug , " he added triumphantly , " you know Miss Bitty-Bug , she got pretty good political instincts too , now , and she agrees with me  --  we got a feelin ' that gettin ' that of convention back is what that National Committee 's goin ' to want to do when you call ' em into session next week . " " Who said I was going to call them into session next week ? " the President began in a deliberately indignant tone , and then dropped it because there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . " Of course you 're right , Jawbone , I 've got to get them back , and fast . We ca n't stall it . But I would n't be so sure about pledges , if I were you . I do n't tell everybody , Jawbone , and I would n't want you to , either , but I 've been getting a few phone calls myself from the National Committee , and some of them do n't agree with Esme and Roger ? "  | " Some of ' em do n't , " Jawbone interrupted triumphantly , " some of ' em do n't but some of ' em do , that right , Mr. President ? Yes , sir , some of ' em do ! " " Yes , " the President conceded slowly , " some of them do . But I have n't tried a head-count yet , Jawbone , and I do n't think you should , either . I have n't really had time to get to it , but when I do . . . " He let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ebullient caller was silent too . When he spoke , it was in a quiet , thoughtful tone . " You fixin ' to give that nomination to of Orrin , are n't you ? " he inquired softly . " Yes , sir , that 's what it is , you fixin ' to give that nomination to of Orrin . " " I 'm not fixing to do anything , yet , " the President said calmly . " And I think you 'd be making a great mistake to tell anyone I am . After all , Jawbone " ? and he made his voice deliberately as forceful , blunt and menacing as he had always been able to make it when dealing with recalcitrant Representatives ? " you and Esme and of Roger and your friends , now , you overlook one thing , do n't you ? I 'm in the White House , now . I 'm the President of the United States , now . What makes you so sure , Jawbone , " he concluded softly , " that I might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , now , " Jawbone began hurriedly . " Well , now ? " " Do you think you and your friends can kick me out if I want to stay ? " the President demanded . " Maybe you better think about that before you go getting pledges . Maybe I want that nomination myself , now I 'm in here . Maybe I like it , Jawbone . Maybe it 's fun . " " Then , " Jawbone said in an aggrieved voice , " you do n't aim for us to call that convention back , do you ? You jes ' aimin ' for a real fight in the Committee , and you do n't aim for us to call that convention back . I know it , I know it ! " " I 'm not saying what I 'm going to do , " the President told him calmly . " The Committee has to meet , that 's obvious . After that , we 'll see . " " Lots of folks just ca n't stomach of Orrin , Mr. President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of ' em just ca n't . " " If there has to be a fight , there has to be a fight . Thanks for calling , Jawbone . You can be sure I 'll have an announcement in a day or two about the Committee . You can tell Esme and Roger and anyone else you talk to . " " It 's going to be a toughie , " Jawbone said thoughtfully . " Yes , sir , like I tole Miss Bitty-Bug , it 's goin ' to be a toughie . She agrees with me , too , Mr. President . She agrees , that Miss Bitty-Bug . A real toughie . " " You tell Miss Bitty-Bug I agree , too . Tougher than any of us imag-  | ine , maybe . Might even involve that Senate race of yours in South Carolina , if it comes to that . " " Now , Mr. President , " Jawbone began in alarm , " surely , now , Mr. President ? " Then his tone changed , and for the first time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Committee meeting . " Well , sir , " Jawbone concluded flatly , " if that 's how it 's got to be , that 's how it 's got to be . " " You really feel that deeply about Orrin Knox and Ted Jason , " the President said in a wondering tone . " You really do . " " Miss Bitty-Bug and I , we talked it over , " Jawbone said solemnly , " and we agreed . Folks in this country mighty worried ' bout how things goin ' , Mr. President . They mighty worried . We got a big responsibility in that National Committee . We got a real big responsibility . " " And you really feel that Ted Jason , with all his wishy-washy attitude toward the Communists , and all his encouragement of violence ? " " You say wishy-washy , Mr. Presiden4 " Jawbone objected , " but seems to lots of folks it 's not wishy-washy a-tall , just common sense and workin ' for peace . Folks want peace , Mr. President , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want peace . And violence ? Why , shucks , a few of riots do n't add up to much . " " More than a few , Jawbone , " the President remarked grimly , " and you know it . " " Well , shucks , " Jawbone said . " Well , shucks , now . I guess folks got a right to indicate how they feel , now , do n't they , just a right to indicate ? " " Stop being disingenuous , " the President snapped with a sudden anger . " You know damned well what 's under way here , and you know damned well it 's got to be stopped . You can tell that to Esme and Roger , too . " " ' Course , Mr. President , ' course , now , sir , nobody 's goin ' to endorse or support unwarranted and unnecessary violence ? " " As distinct from warranted and necessary ? " the President demanded . " You crossed the line there , Jawbone . You crossed right over . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastily . " I do n't mean it 's ever warranted or necessary , but just the same " ? his tone became stubborn and he concluded with a dogged defiance ? just the same , lots of folks want Ted Jason . " " The Committee will be convened in due course , " the President said flatly . " And we shall see then what happens . " " Yes , sir , " Jawbone agreed . " We surely will , Mr. Speaker , Mr. President , sir . "  | And so they would , the President promised himself grimly as the conversation ended . Here was Ted Jason again , to complicate his problems : here was the justification for violence , if it could but be tied to a purpose that could be rationalized as good . Again he uttered a wry , disgusted , impatient sound , with such vigorous vehemence that his sister , just going by in the hall , called out and asked if he was all right . " First-rate , " he called back . " Can you bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did he tried , as he always had , to erase the worried look on her face with a matter-of-fact , comforting remark that would give her something else to think about besides him and his problems , which now were multiplied beyond even her usual loving concern . " Ellie , " he said , " how would you and Tom like to come to Washington and live in the White House ? You could be my official hostess . You 're the logical one , and now that Tom 's retired there 's no reason why you should n't , that I can see . Tom could be my unofficial eyes and ears to scout around the government for me , and you could sashay around with Dolly Munson and Patsy Labaiya and the best of them . How about it ? " " Oh , " she said , putting her hand to her cheek in her characteristic way , " I 'm sure that 's awfully kind of you , Bill , but I 'm really not used to that kind of life , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense , " he said with a big-brotherly firmness . " Never let it be said that a child of Leadville ca n't cope with the world 's great . I have : you can . Anyway , Ellie , your President needs you . You know you and Tom will be happy as clams . Let 's have no more talk about it . " " Yes , sir , " she said with a little smile . " Masterful Mr. Speaker does it again . " She frowned thoughtfully . " I wonder if I should even speak to Patsy Labaiya . " " Better , " he said with a chuckle . Then the chuckle died . " Her friends will picket the White House if you do n't . " " Billy , " she said earnestly , " do be careful . Please , be careful . " He gave her a long look . " As careful as can be . But you know how it is . " " Yes , " she agreed quietly . " And it terrifies me . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't do that . It 's against my nature and against my job . I 'm the only President there is . I ca n't duck it , even if I wanted to . " " I can imagine you wanting to , " she said with a trace of returning humor . He smiled .  | " I 'm beginning to see its possibilities . I may just stick it out for the fascination of finding out what 's going to happen next . " But nothing , probably , could have prepared him for it , either for the telephone call from California or the calls he made thereafter , or the events that followed . It just proved , he told himself wryly now as he sat and stared across the dark water , hearing the sounds of distant parties , the murmur of wind-touched trees , that there was no point in trying to imagine , if you sat in the White House , what might happen next . Nor was there much point in anybody else 's trying . Because the headlines that burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were such as to confound and dismay all those who thought events could be tailored to accommodate the wishes of the naive and the fears of the timid . PRESIDENT ORDERS ALL-OUT DRIVE TO CAPTURE GOROTO REBEL CAPITAL , HINTS U.S. MAY SEAL PANAMA REBEL PORT TO WORLD SHIPPING .. . ... SOVIETS , BRITISH DEMAND UN SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING , HEADS OF STATE TO ATTEND ON WAY TO HUDSON FUNERAL . From a log cabin at Tahoe he was shaking the world . I 'm sorry , old friend , he told Harley in his mind . I did n't want to ruin your ceremonies . I wanted things to stay quiet until you were decently gone , but you know how it is in this job : they do n't give you much leeway . You understand . You were its prisoner , too . In the morning he slipped away to Reno and flew back to his capital unattended by the press , as he had planned .  | IN THE DELEGATES ' Lounge of the United Nations , the world was aflutter . In the Delegates ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else , but this time it was really aflutter . No sooner had a good many of its members concluded with relief that one American maniac had gone than they were confronted with the fact that another seemed to be in the White House . It was enough to make anybody flutter . Not the least concerned , as he stood in the doorway and studied the busy scene  --  Asians , Africans and Arabs swirling about in brilliantly colored eddies of agitation , the more drably dressed delegates of Europe West , Europe East and the Americas providing darker-suited areas of emphasis as they gathered in worried groups or sat at little tables before the great windows , drinking coffee with a nervous air ? was the Ambassador of India . Krishna Khaleel , as he often told himself and his friends here , who were many , was a man who liked peace and quiet . Yet in all his years in the towering glass monolith on the East River he had never known life to be anything but hectic , chaotic , bothersome and upsetting . Crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world it was hard for an objective Indian not to feel that nine times out of ten it was the fault of the difficult , obstreperous , unpredictable , unmanageable United States . It was not that he and his government did not often warn this recalcitrant giant , for they did . India could always be relied upon to criticize American civilization , deplore American morals , oppose American policies , and come running to America for succor when threatened by starvation or Red China . There was a special relationship between these two great nations , and this morning , K.K. felt , it was threatened as it had rarely been before by the persistence of America in doing , with an infallible and inexorable instinct , the wrong thing . Because the relationship was so special , he did not hesitate now , any more than he had on any other occasion , to convey the alarm and concern of his government to the first Americans he saw . On this Monday afternoon , shortly before the special session of the Security Council that was scheduled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same two members of the U.S. delegation with whom he had  | so often discussed the deplorable tendencies of their government . One was stocky and sandy-complexioned , possessed of an engagingly boyish grin and an eye that missed few things , particularly women . The other was a giant young Negro whose normally good-natured face wore now an expression of uncompromising determination . Senator Lafe Smith of Iowa and Representative Cullee Hamilton of California saw him at the same moment as he saw them , and with one accord waved him over to their table by the window . " My dear friends , " he exclaimed , a little breathlessly , for his progress across the buzzing room had been interrupted by effusive greetings from the Ambassador of Guyana , the Ambassador of Brazil , the Ambassador of the Maldives and the Special Delegate from Anguilla , " my dear friends , crisis again ! " " Sit down , K.K. , " Lafe Smith said with a kindly air , " and tell us all about it . Today we need the wisdom of the East " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sober expression relaxing into a smile , " will be clear , distinct , straightforward ? " " And on our side , " Senator Smith concluded for him with a grin . The Indian Ambassador frowned as he took the proffered chair and accepted a cup of coffee from a passing waiter . " Well , my dear friends ! " he said again . " ' What can I say , what can I say ? This is all so sudden , so disturbing , so ? " " Out with it , K.K. , " Lafe said cheerfully . " So American . I 'll bet you all thought that with a new President in the White House things would quiet down and fade away and you could stop worrying . " " I 'm afraid , " Cullee observed , " they do n't know the Speaker . " " We thought , " K.K. said with dignity , " that while there would probably be no immediate major change , at least there might be a gradual easing of tensions , a pause , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitals ? " A New Approach  --  as the result of the tragic death of our late dear friend . But apparently the policy is to rush ahead into new adventures , new escalations , new dreadful flirtations with the peace and safety of the entire world ? " " Now , just a minute , " Cullee said . " just a minute , if you do n't mind , K.K. Who is it who caused this new escalation ? Who is it who was going to send in reinforcements and raise the ante ? Who is it who was planning an all-out assault in Gorotoland and Panama on Wednesday , timed to coincide with Harley 's funeral ? " " No doubt that is what the United States will claim , " Krishna Khaleel said serenely , " but it is not what most of the world will believe . " " But we have the captured battle plans ! " Lafe said indignantly .  | " Battle plans , battle plans ! " the Indian Ambassador said with an airy dismissal . " Battle plans may be forged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans stared at one another with an air of frustrated disbelief . Then they began to laugh , rather helplessly . " Why do you laugh ? " K.K. demanded . " It is a serious matter , dear Lafe , dear Cullee . It is a terribly serious matter ! " " We 're only laughing because it hurts , K.K. , " Cullee said . " How conditioned they have you all . It 's beyond belief . " " Of course you realize it is not I who say the United States is lying , or my government who say it is lying , " the Indian Ambassador observed . " I am just reflecting what many here will say , and warning you of it . In any case , it is now rather academic , is it not ? The issue has been joined , and we are about to have a meeting . Will the President use your veto again , as Harley did before ? " " I would consider it very likely , " Senator Smith said dryly . " It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is such an opportunity , now , for A New Approach . It is tragic to see the great United States blindly following the same old anti-Communist pattern . All of these here " ? and with a broad gesture which was noted in many corners of the room , he indicated the swirling robes , the huddling business suits , the whole humming , bustling , busy concourse ? " are so eager for A New Approach . They are so upset and worried about present events . They wish so much that the United States had only ? " " Had only what , K.K. ? " Cullee Hamilton asked with a rising inflection . " Waited until Wednesday when the whole government  --  the whole country , really  --  is attending Harley 's funeral , and then come away to find out we 'd been hit so hard in Gorotoland and Panama that we 'd lose them both . That 's exactly what your friends in Moscow and Peking were planning for us . " " They are not necessarily my friends , " the Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of my own knowledge , what they were planning . " " Well , we 're going to show you this afternoon , " Lafe promised grimly . " It 's going to be an interesting session . " " I believe there will be twenty-three heads of state , " K.K. remarked politely . " A good showcase for your charges . " Cullee snorted . " A good showcase for the truth . " " May be , " the Indian Ambassador said with an elusive and infuriating air of superior knowledge . " May be . " " K.K. ? " Cullee began with a real annoyance , but before he could go  | further he was interrupted by two other old friends who had been slowly approaching them across the great room through a tangle of extended hands and fervent arm clutches from fellow delegates . " Do n't say it , old boy , " Lord Claude Maudulayne said cheerfully . " Just do n't say it . Temper never solved a thing , you know . " " Particularly , " Raoul Barre agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Studying the British and French Ambassadors without too much cordiality on this tense afternoon , the Americans could see that they had a certain air of seeing eye-to-eye that they had not always shown in the past . " I did n't know you two were going steady again , " Lafe remarked dryly . " The President 's decisions really have created a horrible situation , have n't they ? " " They have for us , " Lord Maudulayne replied crisply . " This business of interfering with trade and shipping , you know  --  it 's an absolute violation of international law . " " International law , ' whatever that is ! " Cullee said . " An absolute violation of some people 's desire to trade with everybody . While of course supporting us officially , in Whitehall . How do you do it ? " " I could tell you better with a cup of coffee , " Claude Maudulayne said . " Move over . " And he squeezed in between Cullee and K.K. with a cheerful blandness while Raoul took a seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took note of their little group and buzzed and murmured . " Seriously , we are most deeply concerned . My government is determined that this precedent shall not be allowed to stand . " " My President , " Lafe remarked pleasantly , " is determined that it shall . And I would be willing to bet that eighty per cent of the American people are behind him . " Raoul Barre gave him a sarcastic glance . " ' The American people , the American people ! ' I saw these ' American people ' demonstrating in the street as I entered the building just now . They seemed to be carrying big signs which said such things as STOP BOMBING INNOCENT BLACKS ! OPEN FREE PANAMA 'S PORTS TO WORLD TRADE ! One even had a poem " ? he took out an envelope , put on his glasses ? " which I copied to send to my government as an indication of the mood of the great American people ' : WATCH OUT , ABBOTT/DO N'T GET THE HABIT/REMEMBER IF YOU WANT HAPPY DAYS/THE GUN YOU USE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he concluded dryly , " but 1 ; the thought is clear . " " It pleases you , does n't it ? " Lafe remarked . " You Europeans just  | love to see us get into the riot-and-assassination pattern , do n't you ? It puts everybody on the same level . Maybe it can even be the end of America , and that would be what you 'd love to have happen , would n't it ? " " That is a very foolish remark , " the French Ambassador observed calmly . " No one wants the United States destroyed . We just want it to abide by recognized rules of international behavior . However , " he added , forestalling Lafe 's sarcastic rejoinder , " it does seem that there are very definite threats to your internal stability lately  --  a progressive deterioration , if you like , which should be checked . " " And when we check it , what will the world say ? " Cullee demanded . " ' Suppressing legitimate protest ' . . . Dictatorial methods ' . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound of deep repugnance . " Innocent blacks , for God 's sake ! ' Gage Shelby and his pack of an-archists ! " " First came the Fatuous Fifties , " Lafe said slowly . " And then came the Sick Sixties . . . And out of them came the Savage Seventies .. . and out of them  --  where 's it going to stop , Claude ? Tell us , Raoul . Enlighten us , K.K. What 's at the end of this endless unraveling of law and order and a stable society ? Anything at all ? " For a moment , confronted so nakedly with the outlines and implications of the world they lived in , no one said anything , while all around the spokesmen of the mutually hostile races of man gossiped and chattered and exchanged their worried witticisms on the steady decline of a civilization they seemed unable either to strengthen or save . Then the British Ambassador returned to the only safety diplomats know , which is , One Thing At A Time  --  Today 's Issue Today  --  and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , you know , " he said softly , " regard the recent actions of the United States as contributory in major degree to just the endless unraveling you talk about . My government ? " " Your government , " Lafe snapped , " fights at our side in Gorotoland , endorses our position in Panama , and is selling arms and supplies briskly to our enemies in both countries . Who is unraveling what , may I ask ? " " Nonetheless , " Lord Maudulayne said stubbornly , " we do not accept the principle that the United States can unilaterally interfere with our shipping and our trade . " " You assume , you see , " the French Ambassador pointed out dryly , " that there was ever a skein of consistency  --  unless it be consistent inconsistency  --  in British policy . You assume that integrity is a desirable element in international affairs . How naive ! "  | " Yes , we know , " Cullee agreed . " France has shown us that . " " The alternative , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our trade , destroy our economy , impoverish us and make us your international ward . Would you prefer that ? " " We would prefer , " Lafe said , " that you try something besides always trading with those who have as their goal our destruction  --  and your own destruction . You talk about the United States being chained to old policies and old habits ! The rest of you are just as chained to them , and the results are just as fatal to any real solution of the world 's difficulties . London still operates on the old imperial philosophy of trade-with-anybody , no matter what he stands for , even if he wants to destroy you . That worked when Britain was big enough so that it did n't matter a damn what your customers thought , because you were so powerful nobody could destroy you . But , my friend , you are n't that powerful now . Now it really does matter if your customers ' ultimate aim is to destroy you , because now they have the capability to do it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness Hong Kong and the pathetic history of diplomatic relations with Red China ' and a few other adventures based on the old imperial reflex about trade . It 's time you learned , one would think . " " The Preaching American ! " Raoul Barre said ironically . " The latest development in the never-ceasing pattern of surprises that comes to us from across the Atlantic ! If by learning ' you mean we should all tie ourselves to you with no more independence of action or thought for ourselves , you know very well what our two governments think of that . " " And mine , " Krishna Khaleel volunteered quickly . " But , my dear friends , my dear friends ! " he added with a nervous brightness . " Such ascerbity of discussion does not advance world harmony , does it ? It only aggravates , disrupts , divides . Surely we must not indulge in such carping differences , surely we must stand together ! " " Stand together for what ? " Cullee asked moodily . " That 's the question we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't for some-thing ? " " We intend to stand together , ourselves , for the principles of free trade and free navigation , " Claude Maudulayne said with an affronted coolness , " and I think we had best move on , now , and discuss it with those  --  with the many  --  who see it as we do . " " Your new chum Tashikov is over by the bar , " Senator Smith told him , gesturing down the long room to the end overlooking the East River , where the chunky little figure of the Soviet Ambassador could be discerned surrounded by a dozen gorgeous robes out of Africa . " We  | shall veto your joint resolution , of course , and you might as well spread the word that there is no point in taking it to the Assembly . We will not be bound . " " We think you are making a great mistake , " Lord Maudulayne observed . " We think we are in good company , " Cullee Hamilton replied evenly . When they were alone again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interrupt as the hour grew closer to the time the Security Council was to meet and take up " The Matter of Increased United States Aggression in Africa and Central America , " the Americans for a few moments said little . Lafe stared with a steady glance , which met many eyes and made them drop , around the crowded room . Cullee looked down thoughtfully upon the plaza and the noisy groups of tourists who shuffled slowly along and disappeared through the great bronze doors below . Finally he opened one enormous black hand and closed it again slowly into a tight , unyielding fist . " Looks like we 're in for an unpleasant afternoon , " he remarked . " But no more than others we 've survived , I guess . The Speaker  --  the President  --  apparently is n't going to give an inch . " " And thank God for it . " Cullee smiled . " He sounded very Presidential when he called us a little while ago , did n't he ? It 's amazing how quickly they slip into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't got time to think , " Lafe agreed . " You 've got to be on top of it the minute you 're in there . " " The press is certainly having a field day with his trip from Reno , " Cullee observed . " But I think he was wise to keep it secret . " He sighed . " God knows we could n't stand another thing like Harley , right now . " " No , " Lafe agreed somberly , " we could not . In fact , I do n't know just how much we can stand of any other sort of thing either . That damned White House riot , and those murderous fools out there in the street right now . . . Did they give you any trouble when you came in ? " Cullee 's expression became somber . " My wife did , screaming and shouting like a little ? " " Is she still with LeGage ? " Lafe asked in surprise . " Yes , " Cullee said . " That little Sue-Dan , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bottle washer and bedmaker and bedsharer , way it looks to me . But I do n't care ! " he exclaimed with a sudden bitter anger , smashing his huge fist into the palm of his other hand . " I do n't care two cents for that little tramp ! I 'm get-  | ting that divorce as soon as I win my Senate seat in California . " " And are you going to ? " Lafe asked , drawing Cullee away from a topic that always upset him deeply , so much was he still in love with the fox-faced little virago who had left him six months ago because he was n't militant enough . " It looks good , " Cullee said . " Better if Orrin gets the nomination , but good either way , I think . In spite of all the kooks in California , and a couple of the major non-newspapers out there , and all . " " There 's going to be one hell of a fight in the National Committee , " Lafe said thoughtfully , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just passing with the Special Envoy of The Free Scillys Liberation Movement . " There is that , " Cullee agreed . " The whole world 's going to try to mix into that one . But I still think Orrin can swing it . " " I think Orrin 's got to swing it , " Lafe said . " After the performance Ted put on at the convention , I can see him even less than I did before . I 'm very , very dubious that he should ever be the man for the White House . Particularly since he seems to be playing right along with all the violent elements now , just as he was a week ago . You 'd think he 'd have learned , but you saw the statement he issued after the White House riot . Two mild little sentences , going both ways : All Americans concerned with their country 's welfare must deplore acts of violence . Equally must they deplore the fact that many responsible citizens apparently feel that certain policies are so unsatisfactory that the only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other words , there stands Ted Jason who has n't changed one bit , thank you very much . " " Helen-Anne Carrew called me last night , " Cullee said . " Ceil 's left him , you know  --  Helen-Anne talked to her at Vistazo ' And apparently it 's because she 's completely upset about his condoning violence . Upset and , I gathered from Helen-Anne , frightened . So much so that she 'd like him out of the race . " " Did she tell Helen-Anne all that ? " Cullee chuckled . " No , but you know our demon news-hen . Helen-Anne can take a sneeze , a sniff and a snuffle and write 1500 words of in-depth analysis . " " The whole Washington press corps can do that , " Lafe said . He frowned . " So she 's actually left . That 's going to hurt him . " " That Cell is a great gal , " Cullee said . " A real lady . Left , insofar as she 's gone to Vistazo , ' anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to it , at least right now . She apparently wants him to think about things a little . "  | " His statement on the riot indicates he 's doing so , magnificently , " Lafe said . " Good Lord ! " he added with a blaze of anger . " That guy is a fool to play around with the kind of dynamite he 's playing around with . If Harley had n't died , he 'd be completely discredited . Does n't he know that Van Ackerman and Shelby and Kleinfert and all that crew are bad , bad business ? He 's an absolute fool . " Cullee shrugged . " I think he figures he can handle it . He proved at the convention that he could n't , but that was n't enough for him . He has to prove it all over again . " " But he 's only encouraging things that may destroy the country ? organized by people who really do want to destroy the country . " " Do n't tell me , " Cullee said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , poor ambitious fellow . He 'll find out . Anybody who goes down that road , in America , is inviting his own destruction . " " But he can destroy a lot of other things as he goes , " Lafe said grimly . " Well , he ca n't destroy me , " Cullee said , his face taking on a sudden pugnacious look that made the Ambassador of Egypt , who happened to catch his eye , give a startled little jump and look quite guilty . " Old ' Gage and his bullyboys , they beat me up once already , you know , when Terry was here six months ago taking Gorotoland away from the British and giving us hell about civil rights . My dear old Howard University roommate ' Gage , he and his friends did n't like the way I was standing up to black racism here in the UN , so they beat me up . But they did n't scare me . And they wo n't , either ! " His scowl increased and the Egyptian Ambassador , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . " They scare Sarah , though , do n't they ? " Lafe asked , and at the mention of Sarah Johnson , the secretary from the American delegation whom Cullee hoped eventually to marry , the scowl faded and a gentle expression came . " Sarah 's a brave girl , " Cullee said . " She knows you take risks in public life , particularly nowadays . It does n't make her happy , but she knows it 's my life , so  --  that 's how it is . How about Mabel ? " " Mabel ? " The name of the widow of Senator Brigham Anderson of Utah , whose tragic suicide at the height of the Leffingwell nomination battle had shattered them all , brought a changed expression to Senator Smith 's face too : uneasy , concerned , unhappy . " Oh , she 's feared and hated politics ever since Brig 's death , and the convention only made it worse . She called me from Salt Lake City last night " ? he nodded in answer to Cullee 's unspoken question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , actually  --  but it was mainly just to urge me again to be careful , and , if possible , to get out of politics . " He sighed . " She knows that wo n't work . I 'm coming up to what looks like almost certain re-election in November , and I ca n't get out . It 's my life , too . She knows that . " " I thought maybe being together at the convention ? " Cullee suggested , but Lafe shook his head with a glum expression . " No , it just made things worse  --  I mean , better as far as we personally are concerned , but worse as far as getting her to marry me and get back into politics herself is concerned . The violence terrified her . " He gave a rueful , unhappy smile . " I guess little Lafe , " he said with a surprising note of bitterness , " will just have to keep on chasing half the skirts at the UN , just as they all think I do " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you seen him since you got back from San Francisco ? " " I went up the Hudson to the sanitarium yesterday morning , " Lafe said . His sad expression deepened at the thought of handsome young Jimmy , son of their late beloved colleague , Senator Plarold Fry of West Virginia , locked away by a childhood illness in sortie silent , unbreathable world of his own . " There was  --  I thought  --  a flicker  --  just a flicker ? of recognition again . But hell , buddy , you know him  --  You know hove easy it is to think you get some response , when really it 's just that you 're wishing so desperately for one that you begin to imagine things . " We did n't imagine it last time I went with you , " Cullee said firmlY ? " He tried to speak to us . Now , you know that . " " Maybe , " Lafe said sadly . " Maybe " " He did , " Cullee said . " He did . So stop trying " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make yourself gloomier than you naturally are . " " Jesus ! " Lafe said with a wince , and then a grin . " Watch it , maul You do n't know how it feels when you put all 8o pounds into a squeeze . " " Two-thirty , " Cullee said proudly , " and losing every day . " He grinned too . " I expect this afternoon 's session will drain out about another twenty . I get so damned tired of Tashikov jag away at us and never saying anything but the same old lies that everybody knows are lies . " " And now he has Claude Maudulayne to back him up , " Lafe said thoughtfully . " I swear , the British never fail to amaze me . I love them dearly , but they do amaze me . " " I have a hunch , " Cullee said , " that the Speaker  --  the President  | is going to try to wind up both these wars pretty damned fast , do n't you ? This all-out attack on Mbuele would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make Terry happy , " Lafe said . He smiled , amused as always by the response the name of His Royal Highness Terence Wolowo Ajkaje , the M'Bulu of Mbuele , hereditary ruler of Gorotoland , was able to evoke from Congressman Hamilton . " That crap artist ! " Cullee said in a disgusted tone . " I swear I do n't know which of those two pieces of black trash is the worst , old fancy pants Terry or his cousin , Prince Obi . But I guess our choice has got to be Terry , otherwise we wo n't have a friend left anywhere in Central Africa , and that would n't be so good . I wonder , " he said thoughtfully , " how Felix Labaiya is feeling down there in Panama this afternoon . " " Encouraged by Russia and Britain , I should think , " Lafe said . " Panama is going to be tougher for us , I 'm afraid . The Canal  --  international passage  --  Communist Cuba to help Felix with subversion ? British opposition to interference with trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panama is a little more complex . But I think you 're right . Apparently Bill 's determined to smash right on through and get t it over with . " But when the Security Council finally convened , in its customary way , an hour after the scheduled time of three P.M. , and then proceeded to drag on into the evening , past midnight , almost to three A.M. before its business was concluded , it became apparent in the reports from Gorotoland and Panama that it was not going to be so neat and easy for the impatient American President . His characteristic and experienced belief that " soonest ended , soonest mended , " was evidently not going to be supported by events . In the Security Council chamber , around the big circular table where so many of the world 's problems had been debated , made worse , and swept under the rug , the American diplomatic strategy was clear , simple and successful only when accompanied by a naked application of power . Its first move failed . As soon as debate began on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war in Gorotoland and declaring the Council 's opposition to any unilateral interference with trade with Panama , Lafe Smith introduced a substitute United States resolution calling upon all nations to join in a quarantine of both rebel governments . In support he introduced captured Communist plans for simultaneous attacks on Gorotoland and Panama on Wednesday . The United States substitute was vetoed by France and the Soviet Union . The issue then returned to the Soviet-U.K. resolution . After several  | hours of angry outcry against " American aggression . . . U.S. imperialism . . . war-mad American leaders . . . deliberate U.S. interference in the affairs of democratic , freedom-loving peoples " and other stirring phrases always ready on the tongue of any well-trained UN diplomat , the resolution was put to a vote . It was defeated on the third American veto in history , cast by Cullee Hamilton after a short and exasperated exchange with Lord Maudulayne , witnessed with an obvious glee by the Soviet Ambassador and a bland smile by many others . There followed another two hours of bitter attack upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stern warnings that , in the British Ambassador 's words , " No self-respecting nation is going to accept the unilateral attempt to control trade with a government which many members of the United Nations have already recognized as legitimate . " Lafe Smith summed up the adamant position of the United States in his openly angry reply : " The time is coming , and possibly very soon , when the United States may have to disregard world opinion and proceed in the vital interests of its own security to take whatever action it deems necessary to end the dangers to world peace in Gorotoland and Panama . " Furnishing background to all this , the ubiquitous news-tickers in the corridors and lobbies kept up their clicking , clanging , clattering reports , which did not help the American position : MBUELE BOMBED . U.S. ADVANCE SLOWED BY SAVAGE FIGHTING . RED TANKS , JETS , JOIN BATTLE . LABAIYA WELCOMES TRADE WITH ALL NATIONS . In all those areas of public opinion and politics in which issues live and have their continuing being long after votes are cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of worried , nervous , uneasy , unfriendly comment continued through the night and into the headlines of the morning of the day on which a President was to be buried . ARRIVING NATIONAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS SPLIT BY WAR CRISIS ... JASON CONDEMNS EMBARGO THREAT , URGES END TO GOROTO BOMBING ...

DEMAND MOUNTS FOR CONVENTION RECALL .. .  | And in the world of Walter Wonderful , the comments and editorials , the analyses and advisories , were solemn and severe : " Even more than before , " The Greatest Publication That Absolutely Ever Was said in its lead editorial , " it is incumbent upon the members of the National Committee now gathering in Washington to take most seriously their grave task of selecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a background of escalation in Gorotoland , and what seems to us a most dangerous principle of unilateral embargo of Panama , the choosing of a new nominee may well be one of the gravest events of this century . " Not only is the circumstance in which the Committee meets one without historical precedent  --  for never has a Presidential nominee died before an election  --  but the general background of events is such as to call forth the prayers of all thoughtful men upon the Committee 's work . Whether it decides to reconvene the convention  --  the course that seems to us the most straightforward and desirable  --  or whether its io6 members reserve to themselves this desperately important task , we wish it well . " There is one other aspect which gives to its deliberations an awesome , even an ominous cast : the possibility that some supporters of Governor Jason may  --  if thwarted of their right to have the man they want at the head of the ticket  --  resort to acts of violence . " Such acts , we believe , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gathered around this remarkable and gifted man , we can see where some might consider them justified . " And from Walter himself , concluding his column for the day : " Washington waits upon the man who sits silent in the White House ? the man who , having fled silently from his California retreat , by silent means , for silent purposes , has come finally , in silence , to his capital . " Washington knows what President Abbott will do in foreign affairs , for he has already demonstrated by his actions in recent hours in Gorotoland , Panama and the United Nations , what he will do : more of the same . More of the same dangerous gambling with the peace of the world which characterized the late President Hudson and still characterizes the Hudson-Abbott Secretary of State , Orrin Knox . More of the same use of violence in international affairs which has led , and can only continue to lead , to violence in domestic affairs as well . " Washington does not know , however , what President Abbott will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his party 's ticket in November . Washington knows that the choice will do one of two things : if it be Secretary Knox , it will send the nation further down the road of escalation , power politics , unilateral violations of the peace  | of the world . If it be Governor Jason , it will return America to the course of negotiation , responsibility , collective safety and peace . " Washington waits upon the silent man in the White House , while the fate of this and future generations hangs in the balance , and while all around us the dark visage and fearful aspect of Violence Unchained threatens the Republic should the wrong decision be made . " But from the White House , as the world howled on and many of the President 's countrymen sought to bend the future to their purposes according to their lights , there came no word . The press secretary would say only that the Chief Executive was preparing for the funeral tomorrow , and for the diplomatic reception he would give afterward at the State Department . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any kind this night .  | NOR DID he see , really , why he should have , as another day began , / . this time far from Tahoe and a relatively calm atmosphere that he never expected to know again as long as he held this office . He had reached the mansion Monday afternoon , and his hours since had been absorbed in such an onslaught of pressures , crises and decisions that he had hardly had a moment to stop and think . As soon as the helicopter had deposited him on the lawn , he had been met by secretaries , Cabinet officers , old friends from the Hill , each bringing good wishes and encouragement inextricably entwined with his own particular problem . All the problems , it seemed , demanded immediate attention . The President had found that somehow he was supposed to solve them all and at the same time sit down and familiarize himself with the latest news from the battlefronts ; send suitable tributes to the funerals today of Air Force One 's other victims ; brief himself on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American landing-station on the moon which had been established at the time of the Leffingwell nomination and had been growing rapidly in area and manpower ever since ; the condition of the national economy ; the diplomatic picture all over the world ; the progress of negotiations in the shipping and railway disputes ; the latest plan for urban renewal ; the latest plan for fighting crime ; the bill to establish twenty new national park , forest and seaside areas ; the alternative programs for either expanding the Peace Corps or finally doing away with it altogether ; the progress of the revised foreign aid program ; the proposal that the Administration subsidize the so-called " M.M. " or " Modi-Missile , " the modified passenger missile with which the airlines hoped to replace all their old-fashioned supersonic jets by the turn of the century ; the need for new constructions on the Tennessee , the Hudson , the Missouri , the Potomac , the Colorado and the Columbia rivers to serve the almost solid T.R.A. 's ( " Triple R Areas " ? Residence , Retail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those principal waterways ; whether to increase the antimissile defense line ; the latest " personnel problem " in the State Department , which was the same old problem with only a new group of more or less famous faces to differentiate it from the last " personnel problem " in the State Department ; the latest intelligence reports on the Communist Chinese drive toward Indonesia and the white nations beyond ; and finally ,  | Harley 's death , the call of the National Committee , the planning of the funeral and all its attendant ceremonies and events , not the least of them being the problem posed by Patsy Labaiya who , true to her intention , had livened things up a bit by announcing a reception for the National Committee to be held the day after . Somehow he had managed to go through all this without losing his temper , with a reasonable serenity , and with a smile for almost everyone . The only time he had not smiled had been when Mr. Justice Thomas Buckmaster Davis , that busy little soul who bustled about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of putting two fingers into every political pie , had insisted on seeing him last night . Their conversation had taken place after the American veto at the UN , and Tommy Davis ' concern had been about equally divided ! between chagrin at this shocking new example of Administration intransigence and his ill-concealed glee that the worldwide reaction would help Ted Jason . In fact , after a sufficient amount of burbling , in his determined , fussy way , he had finally come out with the flat state-ment , " Now , you know , Mr. President , that Ted stands to gain by this . He just ca n't escape it . You know that ! " " I do ? " the President had inquired with an ominous quiet that would have served as warning to his colleagues on the Hill . " Of course you do ! " Tommy exclaimed triumphantly . " You know you do ! " " Now , how the hell , " the President asked , spreading his hands flat out on the desk before him and staring at his ubiquitous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most imperial , " would I know that ? I have a country to run , Tommy , I ca n't be chasing around ( 4 after little old messy politics all the time . " " Bill ! " Tommy exclaimed . " Now , Mr. President , my dear boy ? " " I 'm only about five years younger than you are , Tommy , " the President interrupted . " Some boy ! ' I 'm not one of your little legislative scholarship fellows who sits at Mr. Justice Davis ' feet and thinks all 1 wisdom flows from there . I know it 's just political athlete 's foot . " " Mr. President , " Tommy Davis said indignantly , " now that is hitting below the belt . You are perfectly aware that I only participate in these programs because these fine young people from all over the country ask specifically to talk to me . I do n't volunteer myself , Bill , you know I 've never been one to do that . They always ask to see Mr. Justice Davis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remarked with a somewhat waspish satisfaction , " than ask to see some of my distinguished brethren on the Bench . They know who can give them accurate in-  | formation on what 's going on in Washington , Bill . They 're not fools ! " " And then they go back home with Washington As Seen By Tommy Davis clutched to their breasts and live in its light forever after . My God ! " the President said , slapping one hand on the desk . " It 's a wonder America survives ! " " Well , she wo n't survive , I can tell you that , " Justice Davis said sharply , " if Orrin Knox gets that nomination and becomes President . " " Sound pretty positive there , Tommy boy , " the President remarked . " What makes you so certain ? For that matter , what makes you so certain Orrin 's going to have a chance at it ? Or Ted either , for that matter ? " " Now , surely you do n't mean ? " Tommy began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't mean ? ! " " Why not ? " the President inquired blandly . " I 'm not doing so badly , Tommy . Maybe I like it here . " " But ? " " After all , it 's a nice job . It grows on you . Might be I 'll just stick around for a while , Tommy , and take that nomination myself . How would that be ? " " I think you will find , " Justice Davis said , recovering with some effort , but recovering rapidly , " that it will not be as simple as you think , Bill . Even you will find difficulty in overcoming the great public demand which has centered for many months  --  and centers still  --  upon Governor Jason . " " Think it still does , eh ? Well , I 'm not so sure , Tommy . After that performance at the convention , and condoning all this violence , and all ? " " He issued a statement repudiating it ! " Tommy Davis declared indignantly . " He just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you want him to do , for heaven 's sake , Bill ? " " It 's one thing to issue statements , " the President remarked . " This is a very statement-issuing town . It 's another , how a man acts . Now , you take Ted Jason , it seems to me I 've never seen a more perfect example of trying to maintain with your mouth that your feet are n't going where they 're headed . " " He 's a great public servant , doing the best he can in a difficult situation ? " " Tommy , " the President said , holding up a hand . " I 'm a great public servant , doing the best I can in a difficult situation . But when I say something , I mean it . That 's the difference between the two of us , Tommy , and it does n't take McCullough versus Tippecanoe to decide that . "  | " Marbury versus Madison , " Justice Davis corrected automatically . " The thing is , Mr. President , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these radical violent elements in the country " I realize the position we 're all in , " the President said . " It 's damned frightening . We 've got to put them down before they put us down . What 's your governor doing to help ? " " 111'y governor , as you call him , " Tommy said with dignity , " is trying to offer a constructive alternative to a foreign policy which seems to many sincere Americans to be leading us straight to the destruction of the world . " " And these sincere Americans will destroy America if they do n't get their way , " the President said . " Yes . " He sat back and surveyed his visitor with a disgusted air . " They 're a'pack of children . Mean , nasty , evil little children , who will pull the house down if they do n't get their way . I despise them ! " He slapped his hand down hard again upon the desk . " And I despise anyone who ca n't see that by rationalizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's doing their work for them and endangering  --  really endangering , Tommy , face it  --  the very life of his country . " " There , " Justice Davis said archly . " There , my dear boy , you may get an argument . " " Yes , " the President said . " Well . In any event , Tommy , it may all be academic , because , as I say , I may take that nomination myself . " " You ca n't win it , " Justice Davis said flatly , and returned the President 's challenging look with defiant head held high , bright little eyes snapping in his keen little face . " Want to bet ? " the President asked softly . " I do n't bet , " Tommy said , but I think you would lose it , all the same . " And possibly , the President thought after his visitor had gone bustling away , Tommy Davis was right , although he was n't about to admit it to him , or even to himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest intention of running , but one never knew . At least he had achieved what he wanted with the threat of it : Tommy had announced defiantly that , late as it was , he was going to telephone his bosom buddy , the general director of the Post , " and I think you may find very lively opposition developing , Bill . " " That 's fine , " the President said calmly . " I like a good fight . " The more smoke he could throw up , at the moment , the better for the purposes he had in mind . $e had sat for a moment longer at his desk in the upstairs study , and then rose , as so many of his predecessors had before him , and walked  | out onto the balcony to stare across at the Washington Monument rising immaculate and perfect against the suffocating night . It had been another day in the nineties , no breeze stirred , the heat still lay heavy on Washington . He thought of many things and many men , and sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why , then , did so many want it , and why did even he , who had come to it unexpectedly and without desire , find himself perilously close to wanting it too ? Now , after a reasonably sound sleep , he had awakened to a day that seemed everywhere , and particularly in this sad house , unusually hushed and still . Everything was muted , there was little of the subdued but insistent stir and movement that he had already , in two short days in residence , come to recognize as characteristic of the White House as day began . His sister and brother-in-law in the next bedroom talked in quiet murmurs as they went about getting up . The knock of the valet on his door was startlingly loud . When the maid came with the breakfast trolley , the clink of silver on china and ice on glass seemed shattering . They ate on the balcony , and in the open air the hush over the city seemed as deep and complete as the silence in the house . " Well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " if you 'll excuse me , I have an errand to perform . " " Give her our love , " his sister said , and he nodded . " I 'll be in my office , after . They want us to be downstairs at the door promptly at eleven-fifteen . " " Yes , " his sister said . Quietly he left the balcony , quietly he went along the corridor to the other wing , smiling briefly but not speaking to the two solemnfaced maids he met along the way , and the two Marines who stood at attention by the stairs . Outside the door he paused for a moment to talk to the Navy nurse who had taken up vigil when Beth Knox and Dolly Munson had finally gone home yesterday morning . Then he knocked gently , heard her soft voice bid him enter . This was what the pomp and circumstance came to , when all was said and done : a sad widow , looking at him with sad eyes . " Lucille , my dear , " he said gravely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How are you today ? " " Not  --  too bad , Bill , " she said , with a little effort , but managing . " I think I 'm almost ready . " She gave him a fleeting , self-deprecating smile . " I 've been ready since six A.M. , actually . " She raised a hand that trembled noticeably and brushed her hair back above her right eye . " Now , is n't that foolish of me ? "  | " No , " he said quietly . " It is not . May I sit down ? " " Oh , yes , of course , " she said hastily . " What will you think of me ? Sit over there by the window and I 'll join you in a minute . The doctor says I 'm to finish at least half my cereal , but " ? and again the fleeting , sad little smile ? " it is n't easy . " " I think he 's right , " he said , sitting on one of the sofas that faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to be a difficult day . " At this comment , perhaps too blunt and unvarnished , but characteristic , she looked genuinely amused for a second . " Dear Bill , " she said . " Dear old Mr. Speaker ! " Then the animation faded , the sadness rushed back . " I wonder , " she said quietly , " if I 'll get through it . " " Of course you will , " he said ; and , deliberately using the name : " Harley would expect you to . " For a moment he thought she might break down , but then it had the effect he hoped it would . She sat up straighter and took another spoonful of cereal with a thoughtful expression . " Yes , " she said presently , " he would . And of course I will . It wo n't last too long anyway , will it ? " " About two hours , " he said . " We ride to the Capitol to get the  --  where the procession forms  --  and then back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and then perhaps half an hour  --  and then that 's it . " " That 's it , " she echoed bleakly . " That 's it . Oh , Bill , I ? " " Now , " he said , rising quickly , " suppose you abandon the rest of that cereal as a lost cause and come over here with me . We have things to discuss . Come along , now . " And he put a hand under her arm and helped her stand up , which she managed somewhat shakily , but dutifully , as though she were an obedient little girl . " Now , " he said , when she was seated facing him across the glowing rug , " what are you and I going to do to make sure that this country goes along the way Harley would have wanted it ? " " Yes , " she said , and he was relieved to see that she was really considering the question , with an interest that brought back a little of her usual rosy warmth , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bill . I think you 've done very well , so far  --  what you 're doing overseas I think is what my hush  --  what Harley  --  would have done . I hope you wo n't let them scare you out of it . " " Scare me ? " he asked with a mock-chiding disbelief . " Lucille ! " " Well , I know you wo n't , " she said , with a smile that he was pleased to note was more like herself . " I ca n't imagine anybody scaring the  | Speaker out of anything . Particularly now , " she added  --  and for a second she hesitated and he realized that she was making a real effort as she ended firmly ? " now that he is the President . " " Thank you , " he said gravely . " But there are vicious forces loose , Lucille . Vicious and dangerous . " She shivered and her eyes widened with remembered horror . " Yes , I know . They were outside this house Sunday night . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful , do be careful ! " " I shall , " he promised grimly . " They killed Harley , did n't they ? " she asked , and for a long moment he did not answer , staring moodily out the window at the green trees , the Monument , the hot , dull sky overcast with intimations of thunderstorms to come . " I do n't know , Lucille , " he said finally . " I ca n't honestly say that . The commission is already finding some strange things . A couple of the crew were involved in a Communist group in Annapolis , there 's a lead into the ground crew in San Francisco that may develop something , the body of a man with a gun was found among the victims ? " " No ! " she protested in a horrified voice . " Then they  --  they were n't going to take any chances , were they ? If it did n't happen one way , it would happen ? " " Now , Lucille , " he said firmly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get into that kind of thinking . All that we actually know is that Air Force One crashed because of some sort of malfunction . We have no evidence as yet of any genuine conspiracy , or any kind of plot , or anything . There are coincidences that are strange , but that 's all we know . Until we know more , I do n't think you should let yourself brood about it , because that way lies nothing but pain and unhappiness for years to come . " " I think Ted Jason knew about it , " she said , almost in a whisper , and again he replied sharply and firmly . " I think Ted Jason is a fool about certain things , but I do n't think ? do n't think and wo n't say , and would n't want you ever to think or say , either  --  that he was in any way knowingly involved in Harley 's death . Ted 's an ill-advised and perhaps ill-fated man in many ways , but I do n't believe that he would ever let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , of course , " he added with a grim little smile , " that if the people who may have been responsible ever find the heat getting too much for them , they 'll turn on him and try to make it appear that he did know . That 's the type they are , " he said with a sudden savage distaste . " Scum of the scum of the earth . " " They 're going to cause trouble for Orrin , are n't they ? "  | He nodded . " Surely . I think the convention was only the beginning . I think we 're going to have many tense times before this is over , Lucille . And perhaps for years after that , if it does n't come out the way they want . " " How horrible they are , " she said softly . " They want to destroy this country , I think . " " I think so too . I took an oath , though , you know , to preserve , protect and defend , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so is Orrin , if he gets it . And even , so is Ted , if he gets it , unless he 's absolutely worthless . And I do n't think he is . " " No , " she agreed with a wan little smile . " I suppose he is n't , really . He 's like everything else in America , all mixed up between good and bad . . . . What do you want me to do , Bill ? I 'll do anything you say . " For a moment he looked at her thdughtfully . Then he smiled affectionately and shook his head . " Nope . I 'm not going to tell you what to do . I 've always thought Lucille Hudson was one of the smartest politicians in this town . I expect you 'll know what to do when you decide the timing is right . I 'll just wait and be surprised like everybody else . " " Well , " she said , and he could tell from her pleased expression that for the moment , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief , " I 'll just have to see what seems best . " " I 'm sure instinct will tell you , " he said . " What will you do , Lucille ? Go back to Michigan ? " " Oh , no , " she said promptly , and it was obvious that she had been giving this a lot of thought , too . " There 's nothing for me there , any more , and here , at least , I can stay in the swing of things and still be part of what 's going on . For the time being , I 'm going to be with the Munsons . " " Are you , " he said . " That will be nice for you . And nice for them . " " Yes , " she agreed , looking excited and taken out of herself for a moment by the prospect . " You know that guest house Dolly has at Vagaries , ' down the slope toward the greenhouse . It 's all furnished and ready to occupy , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be close to them and be with them when I want , but not be a burden . And Harley  --  left enough  --  so that money 's no problem . And also , I suppose I get a  --  a pension from Congress , so I should be quite comfortable there , I think . For a while , at least . I may get my own place later . " " I think it 's an excellent idea . And Lucille  --  you 're always welcome here , you know . My sister and brother-in-law are going to be with me , and we 'd all like to have you here just as often as you can . "  | " Thank you , Bill , " she said , her eyes filling with tears . " I have so many good friends in Washington . " " Yes , you do , " he said , " and do n't you ever forget it . And now , my dear , " he said gently , standing up and holding out his hand , " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some things before we go to the Hill . " " Of course , " she said , her voice getting shaky again as she accompanied him to the door . " Downstairs at eleven-fifteen , is that right ? " " That 's right , " he said gravely . " Are your daughters and their families coming here , or do you want us to pick them up at the Carlton ? " " They 're coming here in a few minutes , " she said , her eyes filling again . " They wanted me to stay over there with them these past three days , but I  --  I wanted to stay here until  --  until ? " " Of course you did . " He kissed her again . " Now , my dear  --  be brave for a little longer , and the ordeal will be over . " " It wo n't be too bad , will it ? " she asked in a tiny voice , like a child seeking reassurance . " No , " he said gravely . " It wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , he was mistaken , for it was not a world nor a century that permitted the decent the privilege of being left in peace . It was a world of horrors in a century of evil , and on this day as on some others , all of its pretenses were stripped away and nothing but the glaring skeleton of mankind 's hope looked out upon its ghastly spiritual desolation . However , the funeral of Harley M. Hudson , late President of the United States , began in relative calm and dignity , and for a time it appeared that it would continue so to the end . Lucille was at the door at eleven-fifteen , white and trembling but holding her head high . Her two daughters , her sons-in-law and the five grandchildren were at her side . The President , his sister and his brother-in-law joined them a moment later . Senator Munson and Dolly , representing the Senate ( Bob having been elected president pro tempore following the death of Senator Cooley ) were with them , as were Representative Swarthman and Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had time to elect a successor to the Speaker . The Chief Justice and his eight associates came next , Tommy Davis tossing the President an archly defiant little glance as they formed in procession to go out to the limousines . Secretary of State Knox , Beth and his Cabinet colleagues and their wives , followed by the dean of the diplomatic corps and his wife , completed the White House party . At eleven-thirty exactly , the first limousine , carrying the President ,  | his sister and Mrs. Hudson pulled slowly away from the steps , the others following in evenly spaced procession . Slowly the cortege moved down the curving drive lined on both sides with the men of Army , Navy , Air Force and Marines standing rigidly at attention ; turned right past Albert Gallatin and the Treasury , right again and down the short incline , and then left along Pennsylvania Avenue past thousands upon thousands of silent citizens , and the rigid double row of servicemen standing at ten-foot intervals all the way to the Capitol , looming on its hill a mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House party left their cars and walked up the worn stone steps to the rotunda where more than half a million people of all races had filed past Harley 's coffin during the twenty-four hours it had lain in state there , a tally that rather surprised some of Harley 's critics who had thought he was as unpopular with his fellow citizens as he was with them . ( Another no , 000 had paid their respects in the East Room of the White House before the body was moved to the Capitol . ) Inside in the hushed chamber with the great dome soaring above , the light filtering down upon the catafalque and the grave faces of the dignitaries , the Senate , the House and the heads of foreign states joined the party . Then the flag-draped coffin was carried slowly down the steps and placed on the caisson drawn by eight matched grays . The cortege reassembled in its limousines , orders rang out in the still , humid air ; the beat of muffled drums began , and with a slow , implacable , heart-shattering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last journey down Capitol Hill . Again the cortege moved slowly , slowly , along Pennsylvania Avenue to the Federal Triangle , past solemn-faced young servicemen and silent thousands ( quite a few , reporters noted , were weeping , though it was only for bumbling old Harley Hudson , that poor excuse for a President ) ; slowly it turned left into Constitution Avenue , moved slowly past the great federal buildings and more thousands standing hushed and respectful ; turned left and , at Lucille 's request , left again and around the east side of the Lincoln Memorial so that for a moment II l the statue of the saddest of all Presidents looked down upon the somber passage of his distant successor ; moved slowly across Memorial Bridge toward Lee Mansion and Arlington National Cemetery on their soft green hills ; and there , under the sullen heat of a sullen sky , met the anguish of the age as another procession , led by a hearse and seeming to materialize out of nowhere , shot from the left through the surprised , unsuspecting ranks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with horns blaring , riders screaming and placards waving . In the wild confusion of the next fifteen minutes , reporters and cameramen stationed high on the approaches to Arlington Cemetery were able to discern and transmit to a horrified nation the fact that several of the cars in the opposing group were emblazoned with the flaming torch of KEEP , the clenched fist of DEFY , the stylized white dove of COMFORT ; that their passengers , shouting wild obscenities at the Presidential party , were composed about equally of whites and blacks ; that the placard affixed to the top of the hearse made clear the purpose of this ghastly intrusion  --  SYLVESTER SMITH , NEGRO : KILLED AT THE WHITE HOUSE IN OPPOSITION TO THE HUDSON-KNOX WARS . GOING TO A HERO 'S GRAVE IN ARLINGTON  --  and that the hobbledehoy crew in their screeching vehicles , might be perilously close to achieving the intent described in the savage chant that soon filled a hundred million homes : " INTO THE DITCH , YOU SON OF A BITCH ! INTO THE DITCH , YOU SON OF A BITCH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! INTO THE DITCH , YOU SON OF A BITCH ! " That the late President 's coffin was spared this final horror was due in major part to the quick thinking of his successor , who sprang from his limousine and shouted to the stunned military to close in and protect the caisson , his own and the immediately following cars . It was also due to the drivers of the matched grays , who somehow managed to hold rein on their terrified animals ( that evening they would tell their wives that they had thought their arms would be torn from their sockets ; but it had to be done , and so they did it ) ; and to the fact that after the first few seconds of stunned disbelief , the military and police did move , the ranks did close , the procession was protected and the invaders were driven off . By some miracle that he was later to thank God for , the President was able to make his own roar of " Do n't shoot ! Do n't shoot ! " heard above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were robbed of the martyrdom they would dearly have loved to provoke . But tear gas and nerve gas were available , and were used ; and after some fifteen minutes of chaos , they scuttled back to their cars and screeched away toward the cemetery , up the hill and out of sight among the trees , to the spot where , a few minutes later , dutifully recorded by a section of the television crews and reporters who had been quickly reassigned by their alert and fast-thinking superiors to cover this ghastly side show , Sylvester Smith , a veteran of his nation 's foreign wars and domestic agonies , was laid to rest . After such an interruption , the ceremonies for Harley Hudson were  | concluded under a terrible psychological burden . His wife and family were so close to hysteria that the President was not sure they were going to get through the brief interment without losing control completely . He himself , phlegmatic though he was by nature and deliberate self-discipline , was shattered as he had rarely been in all his life . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth a sadness beyond words and very nearly beyond bearing . It communicated itself to the country , where decent citizens wondered with a horrified dismay what was going to happen to America ; a wonder made even more frightening when the parallel coverage of the two funerals in Arlington was lent a final terrible note . It was announced about an hour after the cortege had returned to the White House and dispersed that two men wearing masks had run past the sentries at the grave , splashed a bucket of black paint on the headstone and tossed upon the plain white sarcophagus a placard bearing the words , scrawled in blood ( of an ox , laboratory analysts at Bethesda Naval Hospital reported later ) : SO DIE ALL WAR MAKERS .  | OUT OF SUCH horrors the President spoke to his countrymen at nine-thirty that evening , and it was declared , by those who declare such things , that 210,637,209 citizens of the unhappy Republic sat before their television sets and watched him do it . Such statistics were then , as always , a little difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets of the hushed cities and the quiet towns , or in the vast empty reaches where only the twinkling lights of an occasional ranch house broke the deepening dusk , he would have seen that the land was silent and listening as it had rarely listened before . So , too , was the world , linked by satellite into an audience that stretched from Tierra del Fuego to Tibet , from the Cape of Good Hope to Baffin Bay . Wherever men lived , they heard on the " Voice of America " the terse sentences and calm , unhurried tones of the Chief Executive who now led the nation most of them either feared , despised , ridiculed or deplored ; and for this he was grateful because he wanted , as he had told Bob Lef ingwell a couple of hours ago , to give it to them straight , so that no one anywhere would have any doubts about his intentions , his ideas , or his character . His decision to spell it out beyond mistake had been made in the limousine riding back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the edge of collapse , and a sister whose white face and strained expression epitomized for him what he knew must be the reaction of millions upon millions of his countrymen . The majority of them , he knew , were decent people , inclined to look upon the world with good will , not perfect always , not tolerant always , sometimes impatient and erratic in their judgments and emotions , but still basically goodhearted and well-meaning . The America they had known  --  or , idealistically , had liked to think they had known , under all the shabbiness and dross of recent decades  --  was being whirled away from them by ruthless and despicable men . He could sense that his sister for the first time was genuinely frightened for her country , with a terror and uncertainty she had never felt before . And he knew that many millions  --  still , he hoped , the great majority  --  of his fellow Americans felt an equal concern in the face of the acts of the evildoers . To him fell the task of reassurance . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . His instinct for a good speech , the realities of politics and what he believed to be the ultimate good of his country  | told him whom he should get to help him . Five minutes after commending Lucille to the care of her family and the Munsons , he had detached Orrin Knox from the somber group of dispersing officials and taken him off to the upstairs study . Five minutes after that a startled but perforce compliant Orrin was putting through a call to Arlington Ridge Road . Half an hour after that a startled but perforce compliant Robert A. Leffingwell had joined them . Together they began to draft the speech . Very promptly , the task broadened . " I 'm going to reassure ' em , " he remarked thoughtfully , " but I 'm also going to tell a few people here and abroad a few home truths . This is my first speech since taking office and I 'm going to let ' em have it . I want to cover violence and the foreign picture and the nomination and a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gave a sudden grim little smile . " May not be here tomorrow . Never know , nowadays . " He had then left them and gone off to the State Department for the diplomatic reception scheduled for four P.M. , telling Orrin to stay where he was . " Give Walter Dobius and friends something to think about , " he said in the same grimly humorous vein . " They 'll wonder where you are . If they only knew . And if they only knew who you 're working with . Right , Bob ? " " Right , " Bob Leffingwell said , not looking too comfortable , the President thought . He paused at the door . " If you 're not happy about it , Bob , you can go home . No law says you have to stay . " " Oh , no , " Bob said quickly . " I did n't say I was unhappy , Mr. President . I 'm still a little numb at being asked to be here , but  --  if that 's what you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President said . " We wo n't tell anybody . " He turned to the Secretary of State . " Orrin ? " Orrin looked quizzical , shrugged , then smiled . " I guess we wo n't kill each other . " The President snorted . " I hope not . Keep working . I 'll be back here by six . " In the great banquet hall of the State Department the atmosphere was quivering , as he had known it would be . No one dared mention the funeral , everyone expected him to . He took a cold satisfaction from mentioning it not at all . Presidents , kings and prime ministers , most of whom vehemently opposed his actions in Gorotoland , Panama and the UN , many of whom almost certainly relished his discomfiture and that of his country this day , came down the line and shook his hand . He  | wrapped himself in the formidable dignity of Mr. Speaker , greeted them with exactly the right amount of smile , stared at them with a courteous but inscrutable impassivity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President " became " The Great Stone Face " in the next editions . " A somber and unyielding President Abbott today greeted visiting foreign dignitaries following the riot-besmirched funeral of President Hudson , " the first news stories began . Not even the new President of the Sixth ( People 's ) French Republic was able to elicit more than a calm stare when he made some slyly condescending reference to " the difficulties we all face in this difficult world . " " Do we ? " the President asked , and turned away to greet the next in line . At no point did he make a comment that might remotely be construed as bearing upon either United States involvements overseas or the dreadful events of the day . By the time he left the reception , shortly before six , he had successfully established an aura of mystery in the minds of his drinking , gossiping , hors d'oeuvres-gulping guests . Orrin 's absence nicely compounded it . What are they up to ? was the general burden of the noisy crowd of famous global leaders upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but most explicit expression of contempt as he departed . The expression of course was noted too . A genuine uneasiness followed his departure . This was , after all , the President of the United States . They did not like to have him acting like a cold and implacable man . It disturbed them , which was what he wanted it to do . Promptly at six P.M. the press secretary called in the reporters hanging about in the lobby and announced that the President would go on the air at nine . At that point Orrin and Bob Leffingwell had the first draft finished . The President told them to order some drinks and dinner for themselves in the study , took the scribbled-over , crossed-out , written-in pages into his bedroom , propped himself up comfortably on some pillows and began to read and edit . By seven he had it shaped up about the way he wanted it and took it back out to Orrin and Bob , who were , he was pleased to see , in quietly amicable conversation . He called in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their last-minute suggestions ; read it slowly through once again aloud , making a few final corrections in his round , firm hand ; sent it down to be typed for delivery . This brought him up to eight-fifteen . He decided he needed half an hour 's rest , decided also that a sudden change of plan would be good for his critics ' psychological equilibrium . He told the press secretary to notify the networks that he would speak at nine-thirty instead of nine , which caused great outcries and anguish ( " He ca n't do that ! " NBC wailed to the press secretary . " He ca n't ? " the  | secretary said . " Know anybody who can stop him ? " ) . It also made the world even more uneasy about his intentions , which , he thought with a sardonic amusement , was a good thing . He lay down for thirty minutes of instant , deep sleep ; was wakened by his valet promptly at nine , got up , washed , put on the freshly pressed suit laid out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television room ready to go . The Great Seal appeared on the screens at nine-thirty exactly , a hushed voice uttered the standard , " Ladies and gentlemen , from the White House in Washington , D.C. , we bring you the President of the United States , " and he was on . He felt grave and looked grave . He also felt powerful and looked powerful . He was in no mood to equivocate . " My countrymen , " he said , looking straight into the cameras , " my first word to you is this : your country is still here . She is going to remain here . Under my administration she is going to do what is best and right for her to do . Neither foreign critics nor domestic guttersnipes are going to deflect her one inch . " To those who desecrated this sad day , and to those who either by deed or thought supported them , I say : you have met your match . I am sending to Congress tomorrow a message outlining a stringent antiriot law which will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against anarchy  --  and protect the honest citizen in the honest exercise of his right of dissent as long as that dissent is peaceable , law-abiding and within the customary norms of decent social behavior . " While I hold this office , we will never again tolerate the sort of thing that has gone on in this country too much in recent years . We will never again tolerate the vicious , insane anarchism which has as its sole purpose , not honorable protest , but the deliberate destruction of American government and American society  --  the deliberate destruction of America herself . " ( He stopped to take a sip of water , and in his apartment in Tiber Towers near the Capitol , Fred Van Ackerman turned to Rufus Kleinfert and said smugly , " He 'll have a hell of a fight on that one . Listen to the damned liberals yelpl " ) " To those honest critics of American foreign policy , " the President resumed , " whose reasonable right to protest has been kidnapped by the rioters , the racists " ? he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rats , I say to you that your government welcomes honest criticism . But I believe , as did the great President we buried today , that you are mistaken and that the present international situation requires us to do the things we are doing . " Let me spell them out once more , for you and for all those overseas  | who honestly " ? and again he paused and gave his words an uncompromising emphasis ? " or dishonestly  --  oppose what we are doing in Gorotoland and Panama . " There was a challenge to us , and to human decencies , in Gorotoland . President Hudson warned those responsible . They did not listen . Forty-four American missionaries were raped , murdered , mutilated . American property was wantonly destroyed . A Communist-trained , Communist-financed and Communist-led attempt was made to overturn the legitimate government of Gorotoland . " In keeping with his repeated warnings to those responsible , President Hudson ordered American intervention . He did so to protect American rights , to uphold the principle of legitimate government , to restore order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and to stop , if you please , further Communist advances in that continent . Three days ago there came into the possession of your government Communist battle plans contemplating an all-out assault in Gorotoland . This assault was to have been timed to coincide with our day of national mourning today . " Your government , " he said calmly , " stopped it . I ordered in additional troops and an assault of our own upon the rebel capital of Mbuele . After early reverses yesterday , that drive is succeeding . I have been informed within the hour that the rebels are abandoning Mbuele and retreating to the highland mountains and plateaus . " We shall pursue them there , " he said bluntly , " until they are beaten . " In Panama , an adventurer who had been planning for many years to seize the country and the Canal , found Communist support for his dreams and started trying to do it . Again , President Hudson moved . Again , captured Communist battle plans disclosed a proposed all-out attack for today , simultaneous with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We have not yet , " he said  --  and a certain ironic line came around his lips ? " persuaded some of our best and dearest foreign friends to go along with us on the principle that it is better to blockade the Panamanian rebels than it is to bomb them out of existence  --  something which , of course , " he added dryly ( " He is so arrogant ! " Raoul Barre murmured to the Ambassador of Lesotho . " So arrogant " ) , " we are completely able to do . " Still , we have hopes that in time they will see it our way . " Certainly we do not intend to change our policy . Nor will we hesitate to enforce it if we must . ( " Oh , dear ! " Krishna Khaleel said nerv-  | ously to Lord Maudulayne in the crowded , quivering delegates ' lounge . The British Ambassador murmured , " Quite , " with a worried air . ) " We shall restore stability and order to Panama , " the President said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seize the Canal . " Again the sardonic tone came into his voice . " We shall exercise the first right of nature  --  we shall survive . " One further thing I must say to you tonight in this first talk as your President . It concerns the election this fall . " You all know the situation which confronts my party . It does not now have a candidate for President , though it still has one for Vice President , the Honorable Orrin Knox of Illinois , Secretary of State . " Both Secretary Knox and the Governor of California ( " That 's right ! " Walter exclaimed bitterly . " Do n't name him ! " ) have , as you know , declared their intention to seek the Presidential nomination through the mechanism provided by our party 's rules . Those rules have never in history had to be used . Now , tragically , they must be . " Therefore , by right of the authority vested in me as chairman of the National Committee , and as head of the party , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee to meet in the Playhouse of the Kennedy Center ( " Why there ?

" ) at ten A.M. on Tuesday next for the purpose of selecting a nominee for the office of President of the United States  --  and , should events so develop , for the office of Vice President of the United States . " It is my hope , " the President said , " and my expectation , " he added firmly , " that the members of the Committee will be able to complete their work swiftly , so that our party and you , the voters , may know at an early date the choices that we will have in November . " And now , " he said , " I conclude this first talk to you as President . I expect to speak to you again from time to time , as may be desirable to keep you fully informed on the purposes and plans of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put me in this office . But as long as I have it , " he concluded quietly , staring straight into the cameras and giving the impression of solid and immovable determination that he had always managed to convey in his long years in the House , " I intend to exercise it to the best of my knowledge and ability , as God sees fit to assist me .

And at " Salubria , " Walter Dobius , summing it up for tomorrow 's column , his fingers racing on the keys : " Washington is saddened and depressed tonight following the first statement of policy from President Abbott . Not so much because the President has revealed himself , in the opinion of many , to be a selfwilled and headstrong man , at a time when America has suffered too much from that type in the White House  --  but because the policy he offers is so stereotyped , so unyielding , and so dangerous . " America will continue her attempts to impose her will by force on the small , backward nation of Gorotoland . America will move unilaterally , if need be , to impose an illegal and potentially worldexploding blockade upon the forces fighting to liberate Panama . America will do as America pleases , with the brief and fatal arrogance that history gives to those who think a temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Washington is dismayed by the President 's call for what he apparently contemplates as an iron-fisted prohibition on all legitimate protest against his Administration 's policies . And Washington links this with his obvious determination to manipulate the National Committee in such a way as to guarantee the election of Secretary Knox as its nominee . " In that direction lies potential fascism , the iron fist of dictatorship , the hand-picked heir that has always been so repugnant to America . " Congress must reject this ill-advised and terribly dangerous proposal for a gag-bill . The National Committee must reject this obvious attempt to force it to take Secretary Knox . An end to this gag-bill  --  and  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | wry though the thought makes him , beginning to feel the start of gratitude . In these recent weeks leading up to the convention , he has been going through a quiet personal revolution . Tonight 's events have accelerated and advanced it . It amazes him now , as he changes quickly into his swimming trunks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his favorite chaise longue beside the pool in the hot , humid night , to think how far he has come from the supercilious public servant who burst out of the Midwest fifteen years ago with all the answers about everything  --  all of them self-consciously " liberal , " all of them arrogant and all of them blindly and ruthlessly intolerant of any other point of view . In this , he recognizes now , he was suffering from the liberal syndrome of the twentieth century , which said that all knowledge , justice and purity lay on the left and all evil , intolerance and reaction lay on the right . He has learned that nothing on earth can be so intolerant and reactionary as a humorless professional liberal , and he understands now as he never did before that out of intolerance and reaction only evil , in the long run , can come . He and his fellows in all that arrogant , ruthless crew that dominated the thinking of the world in these past decades have a great deal to answer for . That world is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws in disarray , its decencies disappearing , its hopes of survival dwindling fast . How much are the conservatives responsible , for opposing necessary programs for the achievement of a more humane society ! But how much also are the liberals responsible , for attempting to impose upon that society an arbitrary form that had no relation to human realities and offered only the most ruthless hostility to those who sought to inject a little human reality into it . How horribly far down the road to destruction has intolerant idealism taken mankind : especially in the hands of those for whom idealism has been only a tool with which to manipulate the naive for the purposes of the Communist imperialism , harshest and most oppressive of them all . How many of the sincerely self-deluded  --  as distinct from the cold , deliberate agents of that imperialism  --  realize their responsibility and their blame ? Not many , he tells himself grimly now . It takes a little humbling such as he has been through to bring about that kind of selfscarifying honesty . Many of them will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it will be far too late for anyone to make amends or do anything at all about it . So he is not too sorry to find that bidding farewell to that kind of harshly rigid " liberalism " does not dismay him as it would have done at  | an earlier time of his life . There are many in the great sprawling city twinkling softly across the lazy river in the hazy night who will go on being true to that concept of liberalism until the day they die  --  or the world dies . There are many in other great cities , in schools , in churches , in places of power and influence in the press , who will never waver and never relax in their relentless hostility to all who dare expose or challenge the futility and emptiness of their beliefs . The world has passed them by , they are old-fashioned and out of date ; but on they go , harsh and rigid and intolerant to the end , trapped in their own pride , unable to make the simple but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect  --  we may be wrong . " Self-limited and selfrobbed of the ability to adapt to the realities of human behavior in a changing time , they are as immovable as bugs self-immolated in amber , eons ago . No longer for him , thank you very much ; and as he thinks back now upon that perfect public servant who came to Washington  --  perfect in everything but tolerance , compassion and an open mind  --  he thanks God for the change . He has not traveled an easy road in the last two years , but from it he is beginning to emerge with a reasonable peace of mind , a reviving self-respect , and a concept of integrity rather far from that with which he began . In basic outline the facts of his life have been simple enough , just as Senator Tom August of Minnesota , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , described them on that morning , which now seems very long ago , when the committee began its consideration of " the nomination of Robert A. Leffingwell to be Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New York , attended elementary and high school there . Graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in public administration . Received his law degree from Harvard . Taught public administration for four years at the University of Chicago . Appointed to the Southwest Power Administration , becoming director of its public service division four years later . Five years after that , appointed director of the Southwest Power Administration . Seven years ago , appointed chairman of the Federal Power Commission . Two years ago , given temporary leave to accept appointment as Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization . A year and a half ago , nominated for the office of Secretary of State . Defeated by the Senate after he lied to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee concerning a youthful , innocent and stupid flirtation with Communism at the University of Chicago twenty years ago . Appointed by the late President Harley M. Hudson to the position of director of  | the President 's Commission on Administrative Reform , which he still holds . Active in international conferences for many years , including terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geneva and Bombay ; arbitrator between India and Pakistan in their recent water dispute ; principal United States delegate to the United Nations Conference on Water , Power and Economic Development of Underdeveloped Areas . Married to the former Louise Maxwell ; two children , Richard , married , of Sandia , New Mexico , and Annette ( Mrs. H. B. Sears ) of Eglin Air Force Base , Florida . Resident of Manhattan and Alexandria , Virginia . Member of Phi Beta Kappa , the American Bar Association and the Metropolitan Club of Washington . Expert on government , supremely competent administrator , given numerous awards as " America 's outstanding public servant . " Somewhat flawed by the past two years , but not , he tells himself with satisfaction as he gets up on a sudden impulse and plunges into the pool , as flawed as he was ... . Back in his chair , dripping but perfectly comfortable in the warm unstirring night , he stares thoughtfully across at the city that looks so placid but has such explosive forces roiling in it , and asks himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to deny that he had known Herbert Gelman at the University of Chicago . But even as he asks , he knows : because he wanted to be Secretary of State , and all else fell before that overriding desire . Given the circumstances of those hectic days that saw his nomination , the Foreign Relations Committee hearings , the bitter Senate debate , the tragic death of Brigham Anderson , his defeat , Harley 's appointment of Orrin Knox to fill the office he had so fiercely wanted  --  he can not say with certainty even now whether the outcome would have been any different had he told the truth . His opponents had already charged him with being " an appeaser . . . soft on Communism .. . weak , wishy-washy . . . willing to compromise America 's principles for a temporary respite from tension that will only be renewed in worse form tomorrow " ? and so on . To have admitted an early flirtation with Communism , however foolish and ineffectual , would only have increased the outcry a thousandfold . He would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been able to show the escapade for what it was , an outgrowth of a lingering youthful idealism , an empty gesture which meant no harm and did no harm  --  if he had been honest about it and thrown himself on the mercies of the Senate and the country ?  | would he have lost ? And if he had , would it not have been better to lose that way , rather than to lose after lying to the Senate , and then have Herbert Gelman materialize like a sickly ghost from the past , point the finger and say , " He did it . I was there . " At least then he would not have defeated himself in his own heart . But everyone on his side , of course , had wanted him to lie at the time . They believed as firmly as he did  --  and his belief was quite sincere , and he was not ashamed of it , and had it still  --  that he did have much to contribute to the country and to world peace , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital that he contribute his talents to saving the world from war , and do so in the most important Cabinet office of them all . It had not taken much to move this conviction into the realm of an arrogant , absolute selfconfidence that would brook no opposition and accept no other possibility . And of course he had not been alone in this . He would be willing to bet right now that if he had consulted the Post  --  The Greatest Publication  --  Walter Dobius  --  any of that powerful group that were on his side in that fight , they would have said : keep quiet about it : if necessary , lie . The President had known about it , after all  --  that brilliant , effervescent , unfathomable man who had occupied the White House until Harley succeeded to it following his sudden death at the end of the Leffingwell battle  --  and the President had told him to keep silent . They had all wanted him to win . They were as ruthless for him then as now they were ruthless against him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whichever way he had conducted himself . The only difference would have been in his own heart , which knew , whether his supporters did or not , what he had done to himself when he denied that he had ever known a former student of his named Herbert Gelman . From that self-inflicted wound it had taken him all this time to recover , but recovery , he knew now , had begun with his defeat by Orrin Knox . It had proceeded slowly , almost subconsciously , for a number of months , as he had begun cautiously to venture forth again . It had come to crisis when a combination of gratitude to Harley for salvaging his public career , and horror at the extremes of violence to which ambition was carrying Ted Jason , had resulted in his leaving Ted 's cause at the convention to place Harley in nomination . And in some curious , almost offhand way , it had settled into what he felt instinctively was to be its final and irrevocable form this afternoon , when Orrin , on the President 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House , and he had agreed . That decision , reached in a moment in his silent house , had been the  | almost automatic response that most Americans would still give to such a request : if the President needs my help , I 'll do it . He had not paused to calculate its effects upon himself , had accepted it almost without thinking . Yet when he was driving , almost as in a trance , over the bridge into town , there had come to him the sudden certainty that he was doing the right thing . By the simple act of asking , the President had resolved many conflicts ; and though he has already had , and no doubt will have later , some substantial misgivings about details , in totality he is satisfied . In a sense , shrewd old Mr. Speaker has done his deciding for him , and he realizes that he feels a genuine relief that the struggle is over . Relief , and a sense of wonder that he suspects will remain with him for a while . Robert A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liberal  --  falling in line with an Administration that theoretically stands for everything he has always opposed . How can it be that he feels so few qualms and so much peace of mind ? Looking down the convoluted corridors of the liberal years , since his youthful idealism first convinced him that the world must be remade in new ways and new patterns , he recognizes with an ironic  --  but friendly  --  smile for that distant believer , that he certainly followed the standard pattern for a long time . In college he was a philosophic leader in all those campaigns that so sternly ordered America to end and the world to get out . He was anti this and anti that , and always what he was against could be related to the established order of things . Yet he did not go as far as some of his contemporaries and opt out of society altogether to go wandering down paths of immaturity and selfdestruction that led nowhere . Bob Leffingwell was basically too mature and too convinced of his own destiny to do that . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described as " the New Left " ? that phrase , so beloved of certain segments of the mass media , which really described just the same Old Left with a new generation of stooges to manipulate for its own imperialistic , Commufascist purposes . But he had never quite gone irrevocably over . Even when he had met and fallen in love with intense little Louise Maxwell , who was militant where he was philosophic , emotional where he was basically thoughtful . How horribly serious and humorless so many of them had been in those days ! How far they had persuaded themselves to go in swapping reality for an upside-down , cock-a-hoop vision of the world and society . What a strange psychotic state they lived in , encouraged by a press which tenderly front-paged their every unmannerly public belch  | and breaking of wind . And how desperately did some of them cling to immaturity still , despite all the evidence of all the years . It was Louise 's intensity , he supposed , which had captured him more than anything else . This was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did it every day , her bare , strained , not unpretty little face contorted with her bitterness against America . Never had the noisy minority of a generation hated its own country more than Louise and her friends hated America ; and with her , as with so many , he could never understand exactly why . She came of a wealthy , established family , had been given the most comfortable of childhoods . She had no reason , but for a long time she was as insensate and unthinking as the rest . It was the fashionable thing to do , in their generation , and so they did it , with that herd instinct of a certain segment of the young that stifles all thought and murders all individuality . The vast majority of their generation went quietly along getting an education , preparing themselves for constructive lives , becoming responsible citizens : Louise and her kind , everyday darlings of the media , rode high , wide and handsome in the days of their noisily pathetic youth . For him it was an intellectual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some basic reservations , for he did not really see for Robert A. Leffingwell any great future in destroying American society . If he had a future , and he believed he did , it was within the framework of that society , not in any chaos that might follow its destruction . And gradually , as time passed and they married and the children came , it seemed to him that Louise , too , acquired a certain maturity and mellowing , though she was still capable of flaring up in a white-lipped , implacable way about her country 's policies . Gradually these outbursts became less , though she was always to be found in the front ranks of the middle-aged spread that overtook youthful rebellion as the years went on . Now her protests took the form of occasional attendance at the meetings of antiwar groups , donations to the Committee Condoning This , the Consensus Against That , her signature on petitions to Congress and full-page ads in the New York Times ( moving higher up the list as he moved higher up the government ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising in the public service and a five-bedroom house on Arlington Ridge Road . He had been genuinely surprised , however , that Seab Cooley or some member of the Foreign Relations Committee had not tried to raise the issue of Louise 's record and smear him with it during the hearings . No one had , and he had finally concluded , with a certain grudging disbelief that he was now ashamed of , that perhaps United States Senators were n't as bad as he had always suspected . Louise 's past could  | have been a serious handicap to him , had it not turned out , ironically and through his own doing , that his own was quite enough . Still , she had always furnished the sort of aura that had enabled him to remain in good standing with what he thought of as the " professional liberals . " The professional liberals , in his definition , were those who worked at it , for whom there was an unending , intolerant , relentless war against all differing opinion , for whom everything was always my-my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threemartini and wall-to-wall . Louise remained , and helped him to remain , dreadfully In with all the Right People ; and , as he was shrewdly aware and cynically capable of using , this did no harm to his career and reputation in an era dominated in major degree by certain powerful elements of the mass media , with their ability , through column , syndicate and broadcast , to condition the country coast-to-coast . He had never told Louise about the days of the rather pathetic little four-man Communist discussion group when he was teaching at the University of Chicago . It had been , as much of his liberalism was , an intellectual exercise , a philosophic experiment , not direct or militant enough for her . She had been as shocked as his other supporters when it had come back years later in a Senate hearing to confront and confound him . He had not considered the episode that important , either when it happened or later . Its only importance , as she and so many who thought as she did were unable to see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ll Almost all men , of course , would lie under oath at some point : a few saints perhaps had nothing embarrassing to hide , but not many of them existed in the world of power and press and politics that he knew . It just depended on which side of the table you happened to occupy . If you were lucky enough to be on the asking side instead of the answering side , you could wrap yourself in righteousness and heap coals on the heads of the guilty . If you were on the answering side  --  and were found out  --  you became a Robert A. Leffingwell , defeated for Secretary of State . That was why he had been a little amused , even in the depths of his first despair over the Senate vote , by the attempts of his supporters to convince the country that he had been defeated because he was a " liberal . " That phony issue had nothing to do with it , as he knew and they knew : they were just playing the same old game they always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : dumpy little Mary Buttner Baffleburg of Pennsylvania had spoken for the people when she cried " Liar ! " at the convention .  | Out of the lie had come what he now regarded , in a way that would be almost mystical in a less skeptical and intelligent man , as regeneration . Out of it too had come what appeared to be the final loss of sympathy that had held together a marriage that had increasingly become , as he matured and she remained essentially the immature rebel of a long-gone day , a matter of calling to one another across an empty room . She had remained rigid , he had become more flexible . He suspected she really despised him because the Chicago incident had been so innocent  --  she would have respected him more had it really been subversive . A pursed-lipped disapproval had reached its climax in her frantic attempts to persuade him not to support Harley Hudson . He had recognized that this was the final step and , for all the reasons which seemed sufficient to him , had taken it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " I hope you 're satisfied ! ! ! " Well : he ca n't worry about that now . More pressing things are on his mind , for he has already had to make the first of those compromises in his new role that all men make , whatever philosophy they cling to . He had been alarmed by the President 's desire to include in his speech a call for a much tighter antidisturbance bill . " I do n't like this , " he had said bluntly to Orrin when the President had gone off to the diplomatic reception . The Secretary had studied him thoughtfully for a moment , then nodded . " I do n't either . It does go too far . But he has to reply to violence and he has to make it strong . If I know the Hill , the bill will go through a considerable watering-down before it sees the light of day . " " It will bring him an awful lot of criticism from people like me who are in favor of the objective but alarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a firm response to violence is more important at the moment than criticism from his friends , " Orrin said . " It 's one of those balancing acts you get involved in here . It 's an executive decision . " He shrugged . " He 's made it . We write it . " " I still do n't like it , " Bob Leffingwell said stubbornly . " Just remember that I do n't either , " Orrin said crisply . " Record that in my favor , if you will . But I see the necessity . " He paused and then said , much as the President had earlier , " You do n't have to stay , Bob . You can go . " Bob Leffingwell stared at him for a long moment . " No , " he said finally , " I 'm not going . Why do n't you try writing it out and I 'll see what I can do to help . " The moment had been a further step along the way . He did not like  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endorsed it but actively participated , for those few sledge-hammer sentences contained a phrase or two of his . The press does not know this now , but it will before long . Somehow , somewhere , through somebody , the story will leak out . ( Not from himself , or Orrin , or the President or the stenographer , probably : but the stenographer 's husband , her girl-friend , her son , her maid , her hairdresser  --  who knows where Washington leaks really come from ? But they always do . ) And when it finally becomes known , the howl against him will be louder than ever from those who oppose the Administration . 1 But the whole episode has been , as Orrin said , " an executive decision , " and for none of them more than for him . All the assumptions of a liberal life had been challenged by the violence at the convention , challenged by the failure of the professional liberals to see the road to lawlessness down which they were taking America , challenged by events of recent years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must stand and defend on an old-fashioned , inconvenient , awkward , vulnerable but nonetheless valid set of principles , if she is ever to do so . He can see now that he has been circling for a long time around the decision to change his public position on many things . After his evening at the White House , he knows there can be no more hesitations . He is virtually a member of the Administration now , and there can be no turning back . Nor does he want to , for the shrewd old President has solved something else for him : he has put him to work with Orrin Knox , and out of their forced collaboration has come a sense of relaxation and easiness with one another that comes from shared responsibility and a job effectively done . After the speech was roughed into shape for the President 's editing , they had a few minutes together to talk . Later the mere physical fact of eating dinner together had also made its contribution . Subconsciously , he supposed , he and Orrin must always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most bitter moments of their contest 1 in the Senate . In their brief talk in Spring Valley , and even more tonight in the White House , he has discovered to his surprise that apparently they really want to like each other . And they have . Tonight he has seen another side of Orrin Knox than the prickly , dominant , impulsive , strong-willed politician . The ironic , whimsical , self-deprecating Orrin has also been present : he has found him quite charming . A lively sense of the irony of their collaboration infused many of the Secretary 's comments . " Lord , if Walter and Tommy Davis could see us now ! " he had said  | at one point and had literally stopped to sit back and laugh at the thought . " Who knows , " he had added , more thoughtfully . " It may be the start of a beautiful friendship . " Bob Leffingwell had replied with a smile and a cautious , " It may . " Orrin had laughed again . " Do n't commit yourself to anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , I 'll grant you . " " I 've probably had worse , " Bob said . " There are no worse , " Orrin said solemnly . " Absolutely none . " But the idea , finally defined between them , grew of itself . By the time he left the White House , going out the East Gate just as the speech began , so that all the press would be occupied and none would note his passage , he knew they were beginning already to think in terms of a more important collaboration in the days ahead . And he knows now , as he lounges in the warmly rustling night and stares at the city of power still alight across the river , that he is probably already committed . As he arrives at this conclusion , which perhaps has been implicit in everything he has done since he decided to nominate Harley , the phone rings insistently . After a moment he goes reluctantly to the house to answer . Who can be calling at this midnight hour ? He might have known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't wake you up ! " " You did n't , " he says cheerfully . " Oh , " she says , and he can tell she is a little taken aback at a cordiality she did not expect after her final bitter denunciation of him in Ted 's room at the Mark Hopkins . ( He can picture that shrewd Jason brain thinking , Now why does he sound so friendly ? I thought he did n't like us . What does that mean ? ) " Is there something I should know about ? " he asks with an innocent interest , pursuing his advantage . " Some crisis , or ? ? " She laughs heartily . " Heavens , NO ! Sweetie , " she goes on with an intimate urgency , and he gives her credit for sailing right into it , " how would you like to be chairman of Ted 's campaign again ? You know I 'm giving a big reception tomorrow night for the National Committee ? " " I 've heard . But is n't it rather soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says archly . " It will be so wonderful if we can announce that you 've decided to return to our side again . You can say that your support of President Hudson was just a personal matter , largely based on gratitude for what he did for you . You can say that you deplored the violence at the convention , just as you know Ted  | did . You can say that you are satisfied that the violence occurred without Ted 's knowledge , and that you are satisfied with his assurances that it will not be permitted to enter his campaign again . You can say ? " " Patsy , " he interrupts finally , a trifle dazed by this onrushing outline , " are you reading ? " " No , sweetie , " she says quickly . " Us Jasons do n't need notes . We think fast , you know . " " I know , " he agrees . " But it still sounds  --  anyway , you have consulted with Ted ? " " Ted and I want Ted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to consult ? " " No , I suppose not . Tell me about the party . Who , what , where ? " " Everybody , " she says triumphantly . " EVERYBODY . Six-towhenever tomorrow night at the Washington Hilton . The entire Committee has accepted , and so have a lot of other people . I want the Committee to meet Washington , and Washington to meet the Committee . I think it should be done in style , do n't you ? " " Do you really think you can do a snow job on a bunch of hardbitten old political characters like that ? Surely you do n't think this will get you any votes . " " Do n't underestimate Washington 's glamor , sweetie , " she says serenely . " It still has plenty . They 'll be impressed . You wait and see . It will help . I think , " she adds , her tone more pragmatic , " that you 'd better join us while the joining 's good . " He laughs . " You sound very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says airily . " This will be a real contest on the issues , this time . We 've already received lots of pledges . Orrin had better be prepared for a shock . But , sweetie ! We 're getting off the track . Wo n't you join us ? We need you , and frankly , if you were to come with us again , I 'm sure Ted would n't forget it when he takes office . " He is silent for a moment and then decides with an ironic smile to give her a shock of her own . " I would settle for nothing less than a written promise that I would be Secretary of State , " he remarks calmly , and he will say for Patsy that she hesitates not a moment . " SWEETIE ! " she cries . " WHAT could be more perfect ? It 's exactly what Ted is planning , I 'm sure . " " But you do n't know , " he says , and then decides to stop playing a game . " Patsy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have no intention whatsoever of assisting your brother to become President of the United States . I have left him finally and irrevocably . But I shall of course be  | interested to attend your party . I expect to have a good deal to do with the National Committee in the next few days . " There is a silence from Dumbarton Oaks . Finally she utters a smooth little laugh which is quite a tribute to Jason will power and self-control . " Well , well . Sweetie , you DO sound so determined . Of course you can come to the party . We 'll be looking forward to seeing you . Bring Orrin , if you like . Ted will be there , and it should be interesting for all of us . " " I just might , " he says , and again she laughs . " You do that , sweetie . I mean it . And  --  do n't issue any statements until you see Ted , all right ? I 'm sure he wants to talk to you before accepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm sure , " she says , " but talk to Ted , OK ? You will do at least that much ? " " Very well , " he says after a moment . " I will do at least that much . " But when he is once again at poolside , thoughtfully sipping a beer which he has taken rather absent-mindedly from the refrigerator on his way out , he wonders why he should have made that gesture of decent gentility toward a family whose members dismiss the people they have no more use for with a boorishness as ruthless as any he knows . Ted would n't do him the courtesy , were the positions reversed . Why did he bother , particularly when it will come to nothing ? He sits for a long time staring at the city over the river . It is almost one A.M. when he goes in . He does not get to sleep easily , and he turns and tosses often through the night in his empty house .  | " SHALL WE co ? " Beth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . " You know very well you want to go . As for me , you could n't keep me away . " " Good , " she said ; and added with a mock approval . " That 's how Jasons fight . " " What 's good enough for Teddy , " he said , " is good enough for me . " He broke into an off-key singsong , accompanying it with a rickety buck and wing . " Oh  --  what 's good enough for Teddy  --  and his uncle and his aunts  --  What 's good enough for Patsy  --  is good enough for me ! " " All right , George M. Cohan , " she said as he finished with a final enthusiastic kick that threatened to overturn a cocktail table , " that 's enough of that . Jasons are n't funny . " " It 's the only way to take them , " he said , puffing cheerfully . " Others worship : I sing . " " Too many worship , for my peace of mind . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , collapsing into his favorite armchair . " Reports of dissension are leaking from the Committee . The press is getting concerned . I have a few friends . " " Bully for you . Can you keep them after tonight ? " " One party ? Do n't be ridiculous . It is n't going to change anything . " " Better act as though it is , " she advised . He nodded . " They 'll know I 've been there . " And so they did , though at this particular moment , when members of the National Committee were busily dressing for their big introduction to Washington , and when all over the capital and its environs the really important and the self-designated important were preparing to descend in a whirl of glitter on Patsy 's party , nobody could have foreseen quite how the evening would develop . Next day Helen-Anne would vaguely recall that at one point she had shouted , " It 's a shambles ! " to Bob Leffingwell across the room , and in retrospect that was what it appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and much had to happen in between . First there were the arrivals , in themselves always a major event at any Washington political affair . The trio of National Committeewomen whom the press at the convention had dubbed " The Three Disgraces "  | ? Mrs. Mary Buttner Baffleburg of Pennsylvania , Miss Lizzie Hanson McWharter of Kansas , Mrs. Anna Hooper Bigelow of New Hampshire ? arrived , as expected , together : Mary Baffleburg plump and belligerent , Lizzie McWharter stringy and nervous , Anna Bigelow solid and acerbic . Mrs. Esme Harbellow Stryke of California , her dark , pinched little face suspicious and uneasy ( looking , as the New York Times murmured to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , like a constipated ferret ) , followed with her co-worker in the Jason cause , the white-haired , dignified , piously shrewd old former Governor Roger P. Croy of Oregon . Bob and Dolly Munson , bearing the Knox banner , as CBS remarked to NBC , as clearly as though it had been painted across their chests , came next . They were followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable about-to-be Presidential candidate of the other party , obviously enjoying the disgruntlement of his friends in the majority . A diplomatic contingent entered next , the Maudulaynes , the Barres , Vasily Tashikov and his dumpy little wife , Krishna Khaleel resplendent in white silk coat , trousers and turban with enormous ruby ( " Not real , my dear friends , " he hastened to tell the Maudulaynes . " Gracious , not real ! " ) . Mr. Justice Thomas Buckmaster Davis and the Chief Justice came in together , the C.J. looking a trifle amused at the company he was keeping . Bob Leffingwell followed soon after with Lafe Smith and Cullee Hamilton ( he had just happened to run into them in the lobby , but their entry together was taken as something of great significance by Administration-watchers ) . Walter Dobius entered with the general director of the Post , carefully staying six paces behind Helen-Anne Carrew who came in just ahead of them and looked the other way . Jawbone Swarthman , looking , as always , half-buttoned , though everything seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cutest lil ' of debutante you could ever imagine  --  at least she had been forty years ago , and still dressed like it to this very day . With them came Senator Tom August of Minnesota , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , peering about with his usual shyly hesitant yet stubbornly determined air of a surprised groundhog ; and after and before and amongst and along with him and all these other distinguished guests there came further members of Senate and House ; more members of the diplomatic corps ; the other members of the National Committee ( only Tobin Janson of Alaska and Jane Smith of Iowa are absent ) ; many members of the press ; and several prominent hostesses , all of whom cooed and kissed and cussed Patsy , who once again had obviously pulled off the coup of the season . Then , finally came the Knoxes , whose entry produced the first real  | sensation of the evening , for it was heralded by wild applause and shouts from many of the crowd and quite a few members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a widely noted and quoted , " DARLINGS ! HOW GRAND THAT YOU COULD COME ! " And then came the Jasons , her brother walking in alone , his uncle Herbert and his aunts , Valuela Jason Randall and Selena Jason Castleberry , following quickly in a group a few feet behind ; and again the wild applause and shouts , about equal in volume , the press thought , to those accorded the Knoxes . Toward each of these arrivals , and toward many others who for one reason or another were considered to be indices to political opinion , reporters , photographers and cameramen surged as they entered . Microphones were waved beneath their noses , pencils raced with their frequently vapid comments , their pictures were taken in varying degrees of amiable inanity . The press found members of the National Committee extremely close-mouthed , but enough others were obliging to furnish the basis for a couple of side-bar stories in the Post and the Washington Evening Star . POLL OF GUESTS SHOWS JASON CARRIES HILTON , the Post said , tongue-in-cheek but making a point for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the Star . But it was not in such minor fun and games that the meat of the evening was to be found , of course ; and before long it became apparent that the tug of war for the hearts of the National Committee was under way in deadly earnest . The first overt move was what Tommy Davis referred to as " that marvelous talk by Ted , " and Bob Munson described in an aside to Warren Strickland as , " the speech from the throne . " It came at a shrewdly timed point when everyone was feeling happily relaxed under the weight of Jason drink and Jason food ; when the big room was filled with the raucous hum of fifteen hundred voices , each seemingly trying to outdo all the others in the frantically hopeless competition for attention . The party had reached that stage , which comes so quickly and easily in Washington , at which no one can hear anyone else so everyone gives up listening and simply shouts in the general direction of the nearest competitor , a brightly fixed expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an ever more rapidly disappearing sequence of glasses in the hand . Into the midst of this , on the dais that had been decorated with two enormous bronze eagles , two American flags and a papier-mache arch bearing the words E Pluribus Unum ( " Not exactly the Presidential Seal , " Lafe managed to shout to  | Cullee through the rising applause , " but a typically quiet Jason substitute " ) , Patsy stepped forth shortly before eight P.M. She was clad in one of her brightly-colored , garishly exaggerated gowns , a determined look , and a cold sobriety that automatically gave her a position of command over most of her guests . " Darlings ! " she cried , pounding the lectern with a large gavel . " DARLINGS ! DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS ? " And she held it aloft and waved it , as a sudden murmurous silence fell upon the happy celebrants . ( " Now , how did she get that ? " Helen-Anne demanded loudly of the Ambassador of the Cameroons . " Their money can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blearily . ) " It 's from the convention , " Patsy announced happily . " And if a certain event occurs that we hope is going to occur , we 're going to BURN it ! " There was a smattering of laughter and applause , a little uneasy . Too many bitter memories for the Jasons rode on that gavel , and they were sure she meant what she said . But burning carried a reminiscence of violence that made many uncomfortable . The mood of the room was suddenly very odd , for just a moment . As if she sensed that she had made a mistake ( Though when did Patsy ever realize her mistakes , Bob Leffingwell murmured to the Chief Justice in the uneasy quiet ) she rushed on to the introductions they all knew were coming , and for a while everything was restored to a familiar basis of understandable political competition . " On behalf of Washington , " Patsy said , " this great capital which awaits  --  as the whole wide WORLD awaits  --  what our io6 distinguished guests are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome the members of the National Committee . We are GLAD to have you with us tonight ! " ( " They should be , " the Chicago Tribune remarked to the Wall Street Journal . " It 's the greatest second chance anybody ever got . " ) " We know , " Patsy said gravely , " that you will do what you know to be the VERY BEST thing for us all . " There was a burst of applause , quite genuine and heartfelt this time , as if in some curious way , at this curious gathering , official Washington did realize for the first time just how very important its ao6 distinguished guests were . The members of the National Committee looked self-conscious and , despite the amount of alcohol most of them had consumed , quite grim : they knew already . " And now , " Patsy said , " I may be prejudiced , but I should like to  | present to you one whom I believe deserves at LEAST a hearing  --  my brother . " And from somewhere behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of California , coming forward so calmly and purposefully into the flashing strobes , the television lights and the sudden wild roar of greeting that very few paused to realize that his wife was not with him . But he knew , and for just a second his face looked quite ravaged , a sad expression that came and went so fast no one really noticed . All they were aware of as he placed one hand on the lectern and began calmly to speak was the handsome , confident , statesmanlike public servant whom so many of them wished so fervently to see in the White House . " Members of the National Committee , " he said quietly , " distinguished guests , my friends : It is good to see good friends having such a good time together ! " Laughter , renewed applause , a sudden warm current of feeling in the room . " I think he 's going to carry it off , " Lafe said to Cullee , and Cullee shrugged . " Sure , right here . Wait until the cold winds blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ted said , " are honored that you have joined us tonight for this happy occasion . May its conviviality be an omen for the days ahead . That they will be serious days , we all know . Yet they need not necessarily be  --  as some have suggested  --  days in which our republic is further divided . " ( " Now who suggested that ? " Bob Munson murmured to Orrin Knox . Orrin shrugged . " Must have been me . It 's the sort of awful thing I would positively insist upon . " ) " No ! " Governor Jason said sharply . " That they need not be . I say here and now that they will never be that , as long as I have anything to say about it ! " " Bravo ! " shouted someone at the back of the room . The press immediately fell into a bitter argument as to whether it was Ralph Jensen , I 1 National Committeeman from Minnesota , or Ewan MacDonald MacDonald , National Committeeman from Wyoming . In any event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , and another tide of applause rolled up . " Our purpose now , " Ted went on , " must be to bind up wounds , not reopen them ; to seek unity , not destroy it ; to create harmony where disharmony has all too dangerously been allowed to prevail before . " Our purpose must be to do what is best for America , and do it in accordance with American traditions and American decencies . " His expression became grave , his voice somber .  | " Many have deplored the unseemly and disturbing violence which has disgraced and disfigured our political life in recent weeks . I have condemned it before , I condemn it now . I want no such support ! " The applause roared out again , and this time there was in it a certain fervent , insistent note that indicated how much , friends and foes alike , they wanted him to mean it , and how relieved they were to hear him say it . " But , " he said , holding up a hand , and instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more uneasy , filled the room ? " but , no one man can do it alone . There must be a disposition , on the part of those whose policies arouse violence , to understand why the violence arises  --  and to make some attempt to accommodate the sincere misgivings which the violence expresses . Y " No one could possibly condone the vicious , horrible things that have occurred in this city in the past four days . But " ? and the silence became almost a living presence , so intently were they listening ? " must we not ask ourselves : why did they occur ? What caused the anguish and deep despair of those who organized these things ? Why are emotions so high and tempers so hot that protest so easily flames into violence ? " Who is responsible ? " ( " He 's doing a masterful job , " Roger P. Croy whispered complacently to Esme Stryke . " What a trimmer ! " Mary Baffleburg hissed to Lizzie McWharter . ) " Obviously , " Ted said , and a sternness came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we need not look far for the answer : the protesters have made it clear enough . It is the present Administration which is at fault . The Administration 's policies , and nothing else , have produced the protests . " Once again a surge of applause , but through it , someone shouting , " Are we supposed to swap them for those of a damned appeaser ? " The press again was not entirely sure who said this  --  thought it might be John V. Wilson , National Committeeman from South Carolina ? decided it was caused by too much liquor  --  decided not to print it . But in the room it had its effect : an angry , agreeing sound began to grow . Into it Ted Jason snapped his closing comments in a level , emphatic voice , his head held high . " Now we have a chance to correct this situation . We have a chance to moderate and accommodate and correct . We have a chance to meet honest objections and honest worries  --  which have , in some few instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has demeaned America in these past few days . We have a chance to set  | things right . We have a chance to chart a new policy  --  of freedom , of decency , of peace . ( JASON CALLS FOR NEW POLICY , ' the Times bannered . EMJ PICKS HIS LABEL : THE NEW POLICY ' said the Chicago Tribune . ) " My friends , " he said  --  and his voice became grave again , and he had , as Esme Stryke remarked to Roger P. Croy , never looked handsomer ? " will we have the strength to do so ? Will we have the integrity and the courage to accept sincere criticism , meet it halfway , seek a true national unity on the issue of war or peace that now divides us ? Will we restore America in the eyes of the world , and in her own eyes , to the position of integrity and honor she used to hold  --  has a right to hold ? must hold again ? " That is our challenge . " That is our task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may deem me worthy to fulfill . " Thank you . " And he prepared , amid another jumble of sound compounded of the approving shouts of his supporters and the answering , angry murmur of his critics , to step down from the dais . But before he could do so there was a sudden disturbance at a door behind him , a wildfire flare of excitement , a quick tensing as many thought ( though there were heavy guards on every door and a hundred cops outside ) , What now , more violence ? and then a wave of applause that grew until it filled the room , as the man who was , after all , leader of the party , came forward and stepped up beside Ted Jason . " Governor , " he said , holding out his hand , " thank you for inviting me . ( " The old sharpie invited himself , " Patsy hissed to her aunt Selena Castleberry . " HONESTLY ! " ) For a moment Ted looked absolutely taken aback . But he had no choice but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure , Mr. President , " he said with a fair show of cordiality , shaking hands and drawing the Chief Executive to the lectern . " Members of the National Committee , distinguished guests , " he said smoothly , " it is my great pleasure and privilege to present to you the President of the United States . " And again the applause roared up , filled with many things , annoyance and worry on the part of Ted 's supporters , amusement and glee on the part of Orrin 's , the overriding excitement that grips a Washington crowd when it sees the game of politics being played by masters . This was the kind of blood that Washington really enjoys seeing ?  | political blood  --  and there could be sensed in the air that happy , delicious anticipation that comes with the conviction that it is about to be spilled all over the room . For a minute or two , however , the President was in no hurry . He stared slowly about with a stolid , unsmiling air , searching out a face here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving on . By the time he decided the moment was right to speak , he had secured silence and an attention that could not have been more profound . His opening remark was so different from what most expected that an audible gasp of amusement answered it . " Now that , " he said thoughtfully , " was quite a speech . " He looked around again slowly , head slightly down , eyes quizzical . " Yes , sir , quite a speech . Do n't know who it was about , of course  --  did n't recognize myself or any of my friends in there anywhere  --  but it was quite a speech . " If I were one of your supporters , Governor , " he said with a smile , not too unkindly , for the man who had stepped back to the side of the dais , " I think I 'd feel as though you 'd made it a perfect evening for me . " Too bad , " he said , " that I had to come along and spoil it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ted made a halfhearted gesture of protest , " spoil it . Because I 'm going to inject just a fact or two , and then I 'm going to ask you to do something that I know you will do , being the fair-minded and decent man you are . " There was a quick , alarmed stirring among Ted 's supporters , a peculiar , half-smiling , half-uncertain look from Ted himself . What was the old man up to ? They knew from long experience that his political moves were sometimes devastating . He had already proven himself to be a strong and unpredictable President . What was he going to do now ? " First of all , " the President said , and his tone became as grave and stern as Ted 's had been , " let me remind you of one fact : the violence we have seen in this past week  --  not only the past four days but the past ten , if you like , back to the convention  --  has not been any genuine protest against the policies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disrupt the United States of America itself . " You say accommodate , ' Governor , " he said , swinging about suddenly to stare at Ted . " You ca n't accommodate with people who do n't want to accommodate with you . You ca n't reason with people who are operating on an entirely unreasoning level . You ca n't appease that sort of thing , or it 's the end of you ... The end , " he repeated thoughtfully ,  | turning back to the room so that his conclusion was not quite as personal as it might have been , " of you .. . " God knows , " he said , " that nobody wants an end to violence more than I do . God knows I am willing to honor , and try to accommodate , honest dissent . But dissent has an obligation to be lawful and it has an obligation to be constructive . This mindless stuff is not dissent as America has always defined dissent . It is something else . Something else , " he said quietly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Others can . Oh , yes , others can  --  if they like . If that 's the way they want to play , others can . But it serves nothing honest , and it does n't serve this country . What others it may serve , I would n't know . But it does n't serve this one . " ( " Of all the damnable , slanted , one-sided , self-serving speeches , " Roger P. Croy whispered angrily to Esme Stryke . " My God ! " " Dread ' ful , " Esme murmured , her dark little face sharp with disapproval . " Perfectly dreadful . " ) " But , " the President said , " that 's something to fight out somewhere else . That 's something we in the National Committee will have to fight out . " ( " Then he is n't going to relinquish the chairmanship , " the general director of the Post whispered excitedly to Justice Davis . " Oh , boy , that 's going to mess things up . " " He 'll be right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in an aggrieved tone . " It 's going to be absolutely frightful . " ) " Right now , " the President went on , " there 's another man to be heard from . Knowing you 're a fair man , Governor , I know you 're going to do the decent thing by him and give him a chance to speak too . Is n't that right ? " And he turned about with a slow , deliberate movement and stared at Ted , who , for a long moment , stared back . Neither made much attempt to hide hostility . ( " Wow ! " Helen-Anne exclaimed to the Ambassador of Mauritania . " Quelle confrontation ! " said the Ambassador with a tipsy smile . ) " So I 'll make way , " the President said , turning back to the room . " Thank you for your attention , ladies and gentlemen of the Committee . Remember that destruction is not dissent and violence is not a safe thing to play with . I 'll be seeing you very soon , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " Does n't he realize , " Walter Dobius demanded of Krishna Khaleel in an indignant half-whisper , " that this is a unique situation ? Does n't he realize that the Committee now is as independent as the Constitutional Convention ? He still thinks he can control it . It 's incredible ! " ) " Governor , " the President said , " thank you for your courtesy . I know  | you 'll be wanting to introduce someone else , so I 'll step down , now . " And with a quick wave to the room and a tight , sardonic little twist to the corners of his mouth , he did so . There ensued a pause of several minutes while he stepped back to the opposite side of the dais and looked across with a polite expectancy at Ted . The Governor did not look at him . Instead he stared off over the heads of the swaying , fascinated , unsteady crowd . He made no attempt to conceal the frown on his face or the grim lines around his lips . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For perhaps two minutes the room remained quite still . Just before the tension had to break somehow , his face became impassive . He stepped forward abruptly to the dais , picked up the gavel , brought it down with a single sharp crack on the lectern . Before their stir of startled excitement was over he had said crisply , " Ladies and gentlemen , the Secretary of State , " and stepped back to his place , from which he resumed staring impassively over the room . Orrin came forward on a mounting roar of applause in which Mary Baffleburg , Lizzie McWharter , John V. Wilson and many others could be seen joining with a wild enthusiasm . But his face , too , was as deliberately impassive as his opponent 's . And he too , once he was in position on the dais , held his moment and let it lengthen until silence and attention were restored . " Mr. President , " he said quietly , one arm on the lectern , " Governor , members of the Committee : I appreciate the honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I thank you for giving it to me . " I will save for another time and place , should you care to hear it , the lengthier statement I might wish to give you on the issues that involve us now . For the moment , suffice it to say that I agree with the President . " ( " There 's a switch , " Jawbone Swarthman remarked loudly to Perry Amboy , National Committeeman from New Hampshire . " Now , there is a ding-clanged switch ! " Perry Amboy sniffed a disapproving sniff and did not reply . ) " What we have seen in recent days is no one 's legitimate protest about anything . It is no sincere attempt to change policy . Any attempt to rationalize it as such is folly . " Its aim is to ruin and destroy . And it is time to meet it head on . " Applause from his supporters , resentful noises from his critics : about fifty-fifty , the press thought , and so did Beth , standing near the middle of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she moved a little closer to them , as if shielding herself from those who did not like her husband .  | " For myself , " Orrin said , " I will not appease it , nor will I excuse it , nor will I rationalize it . It is wrong , and it is bad , and I am against it . " A wry expression touched his face . " This is old-fashioned , illiberal , simplistic and out of touch with the times . That 's me , " he said , and the expression deepened , " all over . " Nonetheless , " he said , serious again , " I conceive it to be a valid position and I stand on it . I too want peace . Any man who does n't is a fool . But I do n't want it at the price some people want to pay . I want it with honor ( " and with force , " the San Francisco Chronicle murmured to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch ) and with some certainty that it will mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can do it . I think we can . " I too stand ready to serve in any capacity you may deem me worthy to fulfill . But be prepared to take me as I am . Because I am not going to change . " And with a brisk smile for the President , a brisk nod to the Governor , a brief bow to the crowd , he stepped off the dais and into the roar of excited talk that welled up and filled the room again . " Bob , " the President said a few moments later as the Senate Majority Leader saw him to the long black limousine waiting in the midst of its motorcycle escort , engines revving up in little bursts of angry , impatient sound as they walked briskly forward , " I 'd like you and Jawbone to start work tomorrow on the antiviolence bill , if you can do it . " " It ca n't be tomorrow for us , " Bob Munson said . " We 've got that FTC amendment to complete by Monday . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jam us right up against the National Committee meeting , unfortunately . But that 's our situation . I do n't know about Jawbone and the House . " " We 'll talk to Jawbone , " the President said . " I do n't see how Ted Jason had the gall to say the things he did , " Anna Hooper Bigelow exclaimed to Lizzie McWharter as they watched Orrin and Beth depart . " He 's insufferable ! " " Of all the egregious insolence , " Esme Stryke declared to Roger P. Croy as they turned back to the bar after vigorously applauding the departure of the Governor of California . " I do think Orrin is absolutely insufferable ! " " Sweetie , " Helen-Anne Carrew said to Bob Leffingwell as they met in the midst of the swirling , excited , gossiping crowd , " have you made any decisions yet ? "  | " You 'll just have to take me as I am , " he quoted with a smile . " I am not going to change . " " But how are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to know . " " Curiosity killed the cat , " he said . She uttered her raucous laugh . " Not this old tabby ! It gives me more lives than I have already . " " I would say , " Raoul Bane remarked softly , " that things march toward an interesting culmination . " " I hear they may in Gorotoland , " Lord Maudulayne said . The French Ambassador shrugged . " May  --  may , " he said thoughtfully . " But not in Panama , eh ? " Lord Maudulayne frowned . " No , I think not in Panama . " " I believe they 're here in the hotel , " Walter Dobius said quietly to Justice Davis , who looked genuinely alarmed . " Heavens , " he exclaimed , " I would n't want to talk to them . " " They are n't pleasant people , " Walter agreed . " But I think they can be helpful . And I think also that dealing with them may be the only way to keep them under control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was startled to find America 's most distinguished philosopher-statesman seizing him suddenly by the arm in a sharp , painful grip . " Tommy , " Walter said in a savage whisper . " You do not know what is going on in this country right now . You do not know . " " Mercy , " the little Justice said with a stricken look , " I 'm not sure I want to know . " " You 're going to have to , " Walter said grimly . " Make up your mind to that . " " Say ! " The Post remarked with some excitement to Helen-Anne Carrew as they met coming out of their respective rest rooms . " Is n't that the Governor getting into the back elevator ? " " After him ! " Helen-Anne exclaimed . But he gave no indication he had heard their noisy hailings , and the doors had closed before they could reach him . They stood for a moment watching the little light blink up the panel . Presently it stopped . " Twelve , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Newsweek suggested . " Indubitably , " she agreed , prodding the button vigorously .  | CANDIDATES TRADE VERBAL PUNCHES AT JASON PARTY , the headlines said . NATIONAL COMMITTEE SHARPLY DIVIDED ...

And very late , the news breaking just in time for the morning final : PROTEST GROUPS ANNOUNCE FORMATION OF NATIONAL ANTIWAR ACTIVITIES CONGRESS . SET MAMMOTH CONTINUING D.C. RALLY FOR OPENING OF NATIONAL COMMITTEE MEETING .  | FAR DOWN the tumbling russet hills she could see the breakers curling in against " Vistazo 's " shore , their crests stained with flame by the setting sun . Somewhere close , in the dry brown grass , a quail uttered its silvery , turbulent little whistle ; farther away in the nearest patch of oaks a branch snapped . Trumpet raised his head and whinnied , then resumed his fruitless search for something green . The pungent mingled odors of sage and bear-clover , baked earth and dried wheat filled the soft , gently moving air . This was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned toward night and all creation seemed to relax and rest from the suffocating heat of central California summer . Except that for her , there was not as much relaxation and rest as she had thought there would be when she left the convention to come here to her husband 's huge ranch north of Santa Barbara . " Vistazo " meant a lot to the Jasons , comprising as it did the remaining acres of the original grant to their Montoya ancestors , filled as it was with the memories and the presence of indomitable old Dona Valuela who had fought for it , saved it , made it the foundation of the fortune whose power now reached over half the world to influence many men and many things . It had come to mean a lot to Ceil , too , in the years of her marriage to Ted , for this was not the first time she had retreated to it to seek renewed perspective on a life , running beside her own , that had increasingly disturbed and worried her as it moved closer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of them seemed to understand , that there had been any sharp , dramatic break between Ted as he now was and the handsome , intelligent and capable young millionaire whom she had met one night at the San Francisco Opera and married , in the most photographed ceremony of the year , six months later . The retreat of integrity did not come in any single , inexcusable act ; there was always an excuse , and there was always a public front that could be put upon it to conceal its inner realities . She had seen this suave concealment gradually become a conscious habit with her husband , and she had hated it ; but she could not blame him entirely , because his friends and supporters had made it so easy for him . Long before he began consciously rationalizing and protecting his own equivocations , those who wished to see him succeed politi-  | cally were doing it for him . He had early attracted powerful backers in the communications world , and well before he reached the point at which he could consciously select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image " ? Jasons in his time had always been too wealthy and powerful to have to worry about image , and anyway his image in his earlier years had seemed to do all right when he was just being himself  --  the press had created one for him . He was surrounded and protected by a screen of favorable publicity , headlines and news stories that emphasized his leadership and strength , interpretive analyses that discussed his courage and idealism even as they subtly but steadily attempted to align him with the political point of view their authors favored . That there might be a price for this when he finally came to make use of it with a conscious deliberation , he never seemed to realize ; but for Ceil , who could see it coming , it was not enough to flash a confident grin and declare with Jason self-assurance that you could handle it . " But that is n't your she had exclaimed after the first big national magazine discussion of his views on foreign policy . " It 's a good facsimile , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all you want to be ? " she asked quietly , and he had taken her hand with a sudden genuine earnestness . " No , of course not . I want to be me . I think that 's good enough . " " So do I , " she said . " That 's why it worries me to see you starting to slip away from it . " He had laughed and kissed her and told her not to worry , but she had not been able to help it , because she loved him and admired him and wanted to continue to respect him . She still loved him , but the admiration and respect were dwindling fast . She realized now , as Trumpet whinnied once again and the sun touched down upon the darkening sea , that she genuinely feared the outcome . What had seemed to her the steady erosion of character in the pursuit of public office had accelerated prior to the convention , and then in that hectic tangle of ambitions and emotions , had seemed to race dizzyingly out of control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the fact of the matter , obvious to everyone on the inside no matter how protectively press and television kept it from the public , was that he had given tacit if not direct assent to the campaign launched by COMFORT , KEEP and DEFY . He had assumed with typical Jason confidence that he could control the situation , and if money and brains had been enough , he would have . But there comes a point in such things when terror takes over , and from that moment money is nonsense and brains do not exist . Terror makes its own rules ,  | and ambitious gentlemen who think they can dabble with it safely find they can not do so without being consumed in some way or another . The dreadful attack upon Crystal Knox had been the more dramatic aspect of it ; but the fact that , even after that warning , Ted had actually been about to let himself be dragged into the vortex of the so-called " Peace Party " movement was , in Ceil 's mind , far more fundamental and frightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitude that she had gradually staked out for herself in these recent years while her husband was becoming more and more the ambitious equivocator and less and less the straightforward , honorable man she had married . Now at " Vistazo " she was watching him far-off ; and nothing she had heard or seen or could sense in the past five days seemed to give much hope of change . On the occasion of President Hudson 's death , after the White House riot , and again this evening at Patsy 's party , he had been given the opportunity to break once and for all with those whose terrorism was obviously moving ever closer to a deliberate attempt to destroy the entire fabric of American society and government . He had not done so . His statement on Harley could not refrain from seeking 6 9 support of the Administration 's critics even as he paid dutiful , equivocal eulogy to its fallen leader . His condemnation of violence at the White House still kept the door open for the adherence of the violent . His talk to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm approval when she left the house ) seemed to denounce violence but rationalized its existence in a further bid for the favor of those who fomented it . Now as Trumpet , giving up at last , responded to her absent-minded tug on the reins and started the long trail back to the rambling old estancia on its ridge above the sea , she feared for her husband greatly . Ceil Jason was terrified of terror too , not only for him but for the country , many of whose citizens , looking to him for salvation , believed him still to be the shining and impeccable knight they read about in their newspapers and heard discussed on their television screens . In her own way , the only way she felt was open to a wife who loved her husband but believed him to be terribly wrong , she had tried to help him ; first , by withdrawing to " Vistazo " in the hope that her leavetaking would jolt him into some fundamental change of direction , and when that failed , by doing what she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never understand her worried call to the President , her advice to Bob Leffingwell to trust his own judgment , the call she had made this morning to Lucille Hudson with its indirect  | but quite obvious message of encouragement to Orrin and Beth . These were feeble little efforts to reverse a process that could not be reversed without his active cooperation , and he would probably regard her as a traitor if he ever found out ; but she knew she was no traitor : she was doing the best she could to help him . Since ambition appeared to be taking him down a road whose end , she was convinced , could only be disastrous , then he must be prevented from going down that road . She was beautiful , intelligent and clever , but she was not superhuman : these telephone calls were all she could think of to do , aside from pleading in an open and abject way that would only disclose the full extent of her fear and worry for him . The end result of that would be to arouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , compounded by Jason ego : he would only tell her again that he did n't have to worry because he was Ted Jason , and he could handle it . Anyone else would have been humbled out of this by events at the convention , but not a Jason : she could tell in his voice that he had come back , and come back strong . And so if she pleaded too openly she would lose whatever advantage and influence she might possess . Her every emotional instinct as a wife urged her to go to him , and it was only by thinking it through in this fashion most carefully , and then adhering to it with a determination as strong in its way as his own , that she was able to remain quietly at " Vistazo . " She had gone on several picnics with neighbors and old friends from Santa Barbara ; done some swimming , a lot of riding ? " Poor old Trumpet , what a workout I 've given you ! " she said with a smile , reaching down to scratch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sunset that had flared up against the banked , innocuous clouds from which no rain would come  --  a lot of reading  --  a lot of thinking . She knew she would not go back yet . When he really needed her , when her return might have some effect , then she would . But not yet . The old servants Manuela and Tomas , children of " Vistazo " whose families had been on the ranch almost as long as the Jasons , had a martini ready for her on the patio . She drank it alone , staring out at the last shreds of sunset as they dissolved in the dusk . The air was still warm and gentle but now the Pacific looked gray and cold . She shivered . " Sweetie , " Helen-Anne said sharply , " I did n't call to play games with you , I just want to talk to your brother . OK ? " " Darling , " Patsy said , " do n't lose your temper . Temper , temper ,  | TEMPER ! I always say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do lose your temper . " " Yes , " Helen-Anne said . " So how about it ? " " Well , you see , dear ? " Patsy began carefully . " What 's he doing , hiding under the sofa ? " " He 's in his room at the moment , " Patsy said with dignity . " What do you want to talk to him about , anyway ? Ca n't it wait ? " " It could , " Helen-Anne said , " except that I want to print it and I want to check it out with him and get his comment on a few things . " " Oh ? " " Oh . " " Print what ? " " Never you mind , " Helen-Anne said . " Just put me through , please . And do n't listen on the line . " " I will if I please . " " Be prepared for a shock , then , " Helen-Anne told her calmly . " Big Brother has been up to no good . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' Now will you get him to the phone ? " " No , " Patsy said with sudden decision . " No , I wo n't . He 's getting ready to go to the White House ? " " Why do you think the President wants to see him ? " Helen-Anne inquired . " Because I 've already talked to the President , that 's why . Do n't be naive all your life , Patsy . Jasons are smarter than that . They 're some of the smartest people I know . Only , one of them does n't know what 's good for him , that 's all . " " Well , you ca n't talk to him right now , " Patsy said coldly . " I 'm sorry . " " You will be sorry , " Helen-Anne said , " and so will he . Because I 'm going to go ahead and print it as I understand it . One of my distinguished and able colleagues of the press , " she added with a scathing sarcasm , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , but I think the good old Star will back me to the hilt . " " What is it ? " Patsy inquired with an equally scathing sarcasm . " Have you caught one of his assistants in the men 's room ? " Helen-Anne snorted . " Oh , Christ , that old chestnut ! No , I have not caught one of his assistants in the men 's room . It 's a little more important than that . But you do n't want me to talk to him , so that 's that . Read the Star . It 'll be in there . " " Print and be damned , " Patsy said . " How grand , " Helen-Anne observed . She gave a sudden ribald hoot  | and used the patronizing tone she knew would infuriate Patsy the most . " You poor Jasons . You 'll destroy yourselves yet , if the world will just give you enough rope . " " I am so tired of you , " Patsy remarked coldly . " I am so TIRED , Helen-Anne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are n't in it with me . You tell Big Bud that I 'm not going to let up on this story , either . I 'm going to stay right with it to the end . His end , I hope . " " Well , I hope it 's yours , " Patsy said viciously . " I just hope so , Helen-Anne ! " " I know you do , love , " Helen-Anne said lightly . " But I 'm afraid you 're all of you just not going to have that satisfaction . " But when she had slammed down the receiver and was staring with an angrily triumphant air around the empty newsroom , puffing a little , looking characteristically disorganized , one strand of hair straggling down over her right eye , another askew on top of her head , she did not feel so confident . For the first time in all her years as a Washington correspondent , in fact , she felt uneasy and perhaps even a little afraid . Great wealth had ways of taking care of difficult matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big and very ugly things were involved here , and little HelenAnne , she told herself , was going to have to be careful . Migh-ty careful . Sometimes , he reflected with a certain somber amusement , a reputation for bluntness could be very helpful when one planned to be the opposite . When his visitor was announced he remained for a moment with his back to him , hands clasped , shoulders hunched , head lowered , staring at the Washington Monument perfect in the night . Then he swung about , stood up , held out his hand with a pleasant smile . " Governor , " he said , " thanks very much for coming to see me at this ungodly hour . " " Your command , " Ted Jason said with a smile equally pleasant , " my wish . " " Glad of that , " the President said amicably . " Guess if it was n't your wish , the command would n't matter much , right ? " " Oh , I did n't mean that , " Ted said , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , " the President suggested , leading the way to a couple of armchairs facing one another comfortably across a coffee table on which cups and a steaming percolator were already set out . " You 've no idea how nice it is to get away from that desk . Already . You may not believe it , seeing as how you and some others  | regard it as the most attractive piece of furniture in the world , but it 's a fact . Less than a week , and I 'm already glad to sit somewhere else . " Governor Jason smiled and took the proffered chair . " As long as you retain the option , " he said . " That 's what makes the difference . " " Coffee ? " " Black , please , " Ted said . He looked thoughtfully around the room while the President poured . " Are you going to have it redecorated ? " " Do n't imagine so , " the President said . " I 'll add a few of my own pictures , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Speaker 's office . Going to take me a week or two to dismantle that . Then I 'll settle in for a while . I imagine you have a very attractive office in Sacramento ? " " Very pleasant , " the Governor said politely . " Good , " his host said , stirring in cream and sugar gently and watching his visitor with a friendly smile while silence grew . Presently Ted put down his cup with a little laugh and leaned forward . " Mr. President , am I supposed to crack psychologically , or something ? Is that the idea ? " " Not at all , " the President said blandly . " Not at all ! Why on earth would I want you to do that ? " " I really do n't know , " Ted said calmly . " I really do n't . But I thought you might . " " No , indeed . " " Then why am I here ? " " I expect you know , " the President said . His visitor gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen-Anne Carrew says it 's all her doing . The face that launched a thousand inaccurate columns , its owner moving like a noisy gray eminence through the secret paths of government , swaying men to her ruthless desires . See them hop ! Senators , Speakers , Governors , Presidents ? " " Not always inaccurate , " the President said with an equally relaxed and comfortable smile . " Helen-Anne hits it on the button nine times out of ten , I 've found . She 's hard-working , clever and astute , and often has the luck that seems to be attracted by those attributes . For instance , she was lucky tonight when she decided to go to the twelfth floor . " " Now what cock-and-bull story has she told you about the twelfth floor ? " the Governor inquired humorously . " ' The Twelfth Floor . ' It  | sounds like a good mystery story or a bad novel about big business . Which is it ? " " Neither , " the President said , also humorously . " It 's just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Which the Star is n't going to print , " the Governor said , " because it 's only her word , and that can easily enough be knocked down . " " She had company , you know . One of her colleagues was along . " The Governor laughed . " You wo n't see a line of it in their pages . Now , if it had been Orrin , whom they do n't like , there would have been column after column of sinister speculation . You know how these things are done , Mr. President . But since it 's me , whom they do like  --  Anyway , there was no meeting  --  nothing sinister  --  nothing . So what proof does she have ? " " She says she took some pictures of you as you came out . " " No one took any p ? " Ted started quickly , and as quickly stopped , while the President gave him a hard , inquisitive stare . " Anyway , " he continued after a moment , " it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I doubt very much that the Star will print it , with no confirmation from any other source . " " Governor , " the President inquired with the quiet curiosity of one who really wanted to know , " why are you still running with that shoddy crew ? Do n't you see the terrible dangers to you and to the country in what they 're doing ? Do n't you see you 're giving them an option on you , even if you only stopped in for two minutes to say hello ? They can claim all sorts of things about your approval and your endorsement  --  maybe even your complicity , for that matter . " " Complicity in what ? " Ted Jason demanded sharply . The President shrugged . " How do I know ? Whatever they plan to do . For all I or anyone outside that room knows , you might have been plotting to kill the President . It 's been done . " " Not by sane men , " the Governor said . The President made an impatient sound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Governor " ? and he leaned forward and turned on the full impact of Mr. President and Mr. Speaker combined ? " there must come a halt to this sort of thing if you wish to survive in American politics , or maybe just if you wish to survive , period . Nobody I know is going to kill you , but your newfound friends might . These things backfire . Violence feeds upon itself ; presently all order and all certainty are swept away . You can not control these forces . I thought you learned that at the convention . " " You and your friends certainly did your best to instruct met " Ted  | said with a sudden flash of anger . The President returned him cold look for cold look . " Somebody had to , " he said bluntly . " You refused to learn otherwise . Now I say to you this : I do n't know what happened in that room , and I do n't know what Helen-Anne is going to print about it  --  if she does . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who believe in you  --  and this republic  --  if you do not once and for all , unequivocally and forever , repudiate violence as a method of conducting the public business , foreign policy and social progress of the United States of America . " He leaned back in his chair and stared out at the Monument with a tired little sigh . " This is so obvious to me , " he said quietly , " and , I think , to all sane men who want their country to survive , that I do n't see why it has to be spelled out to a man of your intelligence . I really do not . " " You really have it rationalized , do n't you ? " Governor Jason asked with an equal quietness , an equal wonderment ; which , if it was not sincere , was a masterpiece of acting , the President thought . And perhaps it was sincere : he could not tell , so earnestly was it presented . " You really have the world turned around so that the policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excesses of protest that have occurred in the last few days . " " ' Excesses of protest , ' my God ! " the President exclaimed , bringing a fist down hard on the arm of his chair . " Is the sort of thing that happened in Arlington an excess of protest ? ' Is the sort of organized disruption we 're seeing all across the country these days just an excess of protest ? ' How neatly you rationalize , yourself . How neatly " ? his eyes narrowed ? " and how well-designed to win you the political support of the disrupters . " " Mr. President , " Governor Jason said , " I am willing to concede that there are some forces ? " " Including those you met with earlier this evening . " " Some forces , " Ted continued , unmoved , " which are involved in these things , and which are not sincere or genuine or perhaps even loyal to the country . But there are many , many millions more who honestly and earnestly and sincerely deplore and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , these people are not , " he said carefully , " kooks . They are not crackpots . They are not wild-eyed radicals or subversive Communists . They are decent Americans , deeply and genuinely disturbed . Am I to repudiate them , when they look to me for voice ? Am I to say to them , Sorry , run along . I agree with Big Daddy , everything 's zao per cent OK and  | you 're just a bunch of disloyal rats ? ' I can not do that , Mr. President . I do n't believe it to be true . " " What do you believe ? " the President asked , as others had asked , and would ask , his handsome visitor . " That 's what I do n't understand . Perhaps if I could , I 'd understand better where you think you 're going , and what you think you 're trying to do . " " I think , if you will forgive me , " Governor Jason said quietly , " that I am going right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am trying to do ? " " Is get there . " " Partly that , " he agreed , " but even more , I think , I am trying to give these people a voice and an instrument to work out a foreign policy that will really lead this country and the world toward genuine peace " The cliches of peace ! " the President interrupted . " As worn as the cliches of violence , " Ted responded quickly . They gave one another stare for stare until the President finally spoke in a tired , musing tone . " I wish I could believe you were sincere , Ted . I wish I could believe you know what you 're doing , when you run with that pack . I wish I could honestly think your method would bring us through . I might get out of your way if that were the case . But I can not for the life of me believe you to be anything but overly ambitious , taking desperate chances with the very fabric of the nation , flirting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just do n't understand . I think you 're the product of your upbringing . I think you think that just because your name 's Jason , you can ride any whirlwind , control any holocaust , put any genie back in the bottle . And my friend , " he concluded quietly , " I just do n't think you can . " " I thank you for worrying about me , " Governor Jason said dryly . " Oh , not you , " the President said . " I do n't give a damn about you . But quite a lot of my fellow-Americans are involved in what you do ? possibly the fate of the country itself is involved . And that makes it a worrisome matter , for me . You have the power to lead or mislead . Right now , you 're misleading , in my estimation , because you 're misled . By ambition and greed for office and people who are taking advantage of those two weaknesses to trap you into being a stalkinghorse for their own purposes . " For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was in a tone of cold and level anger . " You really think I am nothing more than a stalking-horse for someone else . You really think so . "  | " That is the most charitable thing I can conclude , " the President said calmly . " I would n't want to think you were knowingly and deliberately conspiring to bring down your own country . " Again the Governor was silent . At last he shrugged and stood up with a smile that was both tolerant and pitying . " I must concede your sincerity in these strange remarks , " he said , " but I really see no reason to prolong the interview . You obviously really believe that I am a fool , an idiot , a dupe and possibly even a traitor . So I think there 's no point in any further communication , except officially . Is n't that correct ? " The President remained seated , staring up at him with an intently appraising air , head cocked to one side , eyes half-closed , shrewd and analytical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said finally , " is an extremely ambitious man who has been gifted by birth with freedom from all restraints , financial , moral or in personal character , upon his ambition . And so I think you 're getting into things that may well destroy you , and certainly if carried to their extremes will come pretty close to destroying the country . At least in my judgment . So I guess I have a duty to oppose you , do n't I ? " " You have n't been in doubt on that point for six months . " " No , " the President said slowly . " But I kept hoping you might see of your own accord where you 're headed . " " I told you , " Governor Jason said with a sudden , quite genuine smile , gesturing toward the desk . The President smiled too , but there was no humor in it . " I might say , over my dead body , " he remarked softly . " Except that it might be true . " For a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look filled with many things , anger and contempt and pity , and a sort of overriding disbelief that there could be such a man , with such an opinion . Then he bowed quickly , said , " You will forgive me , I must go , " turned swiftly and left the room . He could not have analyzed , had anyone asked him , the conflicting currents of anger , emotion , revulsion , determination , which had brought him in Patsy 's gleaming black Rolls-Royce to this apparently deserted house at this post-midnight hour . He had given the order to the chauffeur almost without thinking ; almost automatically , it seemed , he had acted on the impulse to see the man he had last seen in the heat of anger at the convention . He was not entirely sure why he wanted to see him now , not even sure where the impulse had come  | from  --  some urgency developing out of the earlier events of the evening , some headlong rush of decision coming from his tumbling thoughts , something that seemed logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had not even known the correct address : the Secret Service man the President had kindly assigned to him yesterday had called Patsy to find out . Now here they were , and the house was silent and dark in the steaming hot night . For a second only he debated whether to pass on and try to arrange something tomorrow . Then he strode forward up the winding walk , jabbed his finger forcefully and repeatedly on the bell . Somewhere deep in the house he could hear it ringing , apparently unanswered . He was about to turn away when he heard the scrape of shrubbery alongside the house . " I 've been out back at the pool , " Bob Leffingwell said in a politely puzzled voice . " Did someone wish to see me ? " " I did , " he said , and for a moment there was silence from the shadowy figure standing at the corner of the house . " I 'm sorry I did n't turn on the light , " Bob said in a voice that indicated nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here . One or two of the slabs are a little uneven . . . . Sit down , Ted , " he said when they had traversed the house , the sloping lawn , and so come to the dim expanse of the pool , its placid surface reflecting a little of the light of the city across the Potomac . " Can I get you something to drink ? " " Ice water , thank you , " he said , taking one of the chaise longues beside the water . His host made some sound he could not quite analyze , partly amused , partly , perhaps , quizzical . " I , too . " When they were both seated , he spoke abruptly and without preliminary . " What would you think , Bob , if you had just been accused by the President of the United States of conspiring against the country , threatening it with destruction , and perhaps even plotting to kill him ? " For a moment his host said nothing at all , nor could the Governor see in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was none , for Bob was taking pains to keep both face and voice impersonal . " I think I might wonder , " he said finally , " what could prompt so very grave an accusation from one in such position , and whether I had done anything to warrant it . If I concluded I had , I think I would begin to look around for a way to change what I was doing . "  | It was Ted 's turn to remain silent . When he spoke it was in a halfamused , half-quizzical tone of his own . " Well , that 's straightforward enough . " " I try to be . " " Yes , " Ted agreed ; and said , with a pleasant edge , " these days ... . So is he correct , do you think ? " " I would n't presume to pass judgment on his judgment , " Bob said , his voice impervious . The Governor laughed without much humor . " I would n't call that straightforward . " " I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began quickly , broke it off and started over . " I 'm sorry . Yes , in my estimation , he is correct , at least about endangering the country . The conspiring and plotting may have been exaggeration on his part or exaggeration on yours . . . . Though I can see , " he added quietly after a moment , " that a fair fear could be raised if things continue as they 're going . " " You really think so , " Ted said in a thoughtful tone . " You really do think so . " " What you must realize , " Bob Leffingwell said with a sudden sharpness , " is that perfectly sensible and intelligent people are very much concerned about the course you 're apparently taking . Even though , " he added slowly , " other perfectly sensible and intelligent people , I know , approve . " " Exactly , " Governor Jason said . " That being so , I have some warrant , I think , for doing what I believe to be right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tone again sharp . " You ? The country ? " " Many people , " Ted Jason said with the quiet objectivity that in Washington accompanies only the greatest of egotism , " seem to consider the two identical . " " And that justifies anything you want to do , " Bob Leffingwell said . " Well . . . " In the dim light the Governor could see his profile as he stared at the city . It indicated nothing . " Well , I suppose that sense of identification is necessary if one is to seek the Presidency . I would n't know , thank God . . . . In any event , " he added with a sudden firmness , " a fair fear still lies . You have n't reduced it much this evening . " " What have I done this evening ? " Governor Jason demanded . " Made a speech to the National Committee . Stated my position candidly to the country . Made clear to the President and Orrin that they have a fight on their hands ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paranoic demagogue  | of a U.S. Senator and an unbalanced right-wing weirdo , " Bob Leffingwell snapped . " Is n't that enough to make decent people worry ? " " Oh , that 's the problem , " Ted said dryly . " Helen-Anne has been talking to you too . " " I have n't seen Helen-Anne since I left the Hilton . " " But she called you . " " She did , " Bob Leffingwell said . " It was a damn-fool , stupid , asinine , fantastically dangerous thing for you to do . Who the hell do you think you are , anyway ? " he demanded with a sudden , furious disgust . " And what the hell do you think you 're trying to do to this country ? " " I am trying to provide it with a leadership that will take it out of this dreadful impasse the Administration has led it into , " Ted said quietly . " In that task I need the help of as many good men as I can get . I need yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he realized this was true , it was what had really prompted his almost instinctive urge to talk at once to Bob Leffingwell . " May I have it ? " " Well , " Bob began , and it was obvious that he was literally at a loss for words in the face of an audacity so great . " Well , I ? " And in the dim half-light from the city across the river the Governor could see him shaking his head in a helpless fashion as his voice trailed away . " The task is difficult , " Ted went on in the same quiet tone , " the challenge enormous ; but the reward , I think , great . Suppose we can lead America back to sanity , you and I , " he said , and his voice became touched with an almost evangelistic fervor . " Suppose we can sweep away all the sickness and insanity , the evil policies that have taken us into wars and divided our country and set us one against the other in senseless , self-destroying bitterness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring back decency , banish the violence that springs from the conviction that protest is helpless in the face of arrogant power . Help me do that , Bob ! Come back to the side you really belong on ! Your old friends , " he concluded , his voice sinking to a grave conclusion , " await you . Democracy and decency need you . Help me do what must be done to save this beloved land . " For several moments after he finished Bob Leffingwell did not move , uttered no sound . A little wind stirred the dogwood and the tulip trees , an owl murmured petulantly . The traffic over the bridges and along both sides of the river was thinning , the lights on the Capitol , the Washington Monument , the Lincoln Memorial were out . Full night was settling finally on the District of Columbia . At last Bob shifted position and spoke . " You are an extraordinary man , Ted , " he said quietly . " But I suppose anyone big enough to want to run that town is extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance that I would want to rejoin you ? " " For the reasons I state , " Governor Jason said . " Because obviously you belong with me and not with them . Because you 're a political realist and you know mine is the better chance . Because it becomes Bob Leffingwell to be liberal and it goes against his nature to defeat liberalism 's cause . " " Liberalism 's cause ? ' Liberalism . My God , what an easy word to throw around ! To me you 're one of the great reactionaries , Ted , ruthless to your opponents , bitterly intolerant of dissent  --  yes , " he said angrily as the Governor moved protestingly in his chair , " intolerant of dissent , honest dissent , liberal dissent , any dissent that does n't dovetail with your own ambitions . You say I belong with you : well , that depends . There is a certain type of self-designated American liberal ' that I have finally come to have an absolute horror of , because there is no one more vicious , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that type you seem to have gathered around you : the smug , the superior , the self-righteous , the mindless , the violent , the cruel . That 's the way I used to be , and I know . And you know their excesses and you do n't repudiate them . God help you , I think you 've even begun to condone them in these recent weeks . And now you meet with them in secret to further your own ambitions , and God knows what will come of that . God help you , and us . " It was the Governor 's turn to remain silent . When he finally spoke it was in a steady tone that dismissed Bob 's comments as though they had never been . " I understand from Patsy that you would still like to be Secretary of State . Join me and the job is yours . " Bob Leffingwell uttered some strange sound , possibly a laugh , muffled as quickly as it began . His voice came savage and sarcastic . " In writing , I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ted Jason said indifferently . " I have a pen . " For one insane moment Bob hesitated and almost  --  almost  --  let himself begin to think . But he knew instinctively that he must not , that to do so might be to fall back forever from advances sorely won . In some great inner convulsion of heart and mind and emotion that shook his being but came and went so fast he could not analyze it , he knew he must make the break final , and make it now . He stood up so abruptly that he knocked over the little wooden bench beside his chair . The half-empty glass of ice water crashed on the apron of the pool with an explosive tinkle . " I think you 'd better go , Ted . I meant what I said at the conven-  | tion . I mean what I say now . I ca n't go with you down the road you 're going . " He paused and then with a sigh that made it even more devastating , concluded with the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever : " I pity you , Ted . I wish I could help you  --  I wish it were still possible to help you . But it is n't . And I ca n't . " " Hi , " he said , and again he tried carefully to keep his voice from showing too much emotion , though God knew he had felt enough in these past six hours . " Are you in bed ? " " No , " she said , sounding , he thought , a little more remote than even three thousand miles would warrant . " Just sitting out here on the terrace enjoying the night . " " Is it a nice one ? " he asked with a politeness almost nervous , almost humble . " Beautiful , " she said , also politely . " Quite warm still . A few traces of color left over the sea , out toward Hawaii . " " We 'll have to go there again sometime soon , " he said , very conscious of the silence of Patsy 's house , hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , so awkward and like a pleading schoolboy did he sound . " Sometime . " " Ceil , " he asked after a moment , " what are you thinking ? " He could hear her sigh . Presently she said , " Nothing , really . I 'm just sitting out here , as I told you . Manuela and Tomas have gone to bed . I 'm all alone . It 's very peaceful . " " You must be thinking something , " he persisted , hating himself for it . She gave a tired little laugh . " Must I ? About you ? " " Yes , " he said . " Me . " " Well , " she said with a dry little humor . " I 'll admit the subject has crossed my mind . " " What have you decided about it ? " he asked , adding in his mind , Please do n't you lecture me , too : I 've had enough for one night . And adding immediately , Then why call ? You know she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Does it matter ? " " Would I ask if it did n't ? " " You might . You like to go through the proper motions . " " My God , " he said , stung into genuine protest . " What kind of man do you think I am ? "  | " Too intelligent , " she said , a little of her irreverent humor bubbling into her voice , " to ask a question as trite as that . " " Well , " he said , unamused , " I am asking . " " I think that 's something only you can decide , " she replied , her voice again polite . " How have you done with the problem tonight ? " " Did you hear my speech ? " " Yes , " she said , voice noncommittal . " I heard it . " " Did you like it ? " " Why do you ask ? If I liked it , you 're confirmed in your own concept of it . If I did n't , then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make ? No , I did n't like it . I have n't liked any of your speeches in the last few days . " " Things are moving fast , " he said with a defensive thoughtfulness . " I have to move with them . " " Do you ? " " Yes , " he said crisply . " I 'm sorry it upsets you . " " I 'm not upset , exactly , " she said slowly . " Just  --  I do n't really know . Puzzled , I guess . " " By what ? " he demanded . " What 's so puzzling about what I 'm doing ? I 'm engaged in a terrific fight for the world 's most powerful office . Am I supposed to act as though I 'm playing tennis ? " She was silent for a moment , and it seemed to him that he could almost hear the waves on " Vistazo 's " shore , though he knew they were three hundred yards below . At last she sighed again . " I really do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any longer . You know what I think . You know what I 'd prefer to have you do . So why discuss it ? You want me to tell you that I think what you 're doing is right . I ca n't . So what 's the point ? " " You might at least wish me well , " he said sharply , and then his voice changed abruptly . " Ceil , " he said humbly , " I need you . I need you here . And do n't tell me that 's trite , because it 's true .... I talked to the President and to Bob Leffingwell tonight and they both think ? they both think I 'm out to destroy the country . Do you ? " There was a silence and then she started to say something about , " You 're so  --  so ? " in a voice that sounded as though she might be halfcrying . And then she stopped and the silence returned , and distantly again he thought he heard the surf , though it must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What am I to say ? " she asked at last . " I know those two men do n't mean that you are deliberately trying to destroy the country  --  you know they do n't mean that . But they 're worried about what you 're doing ,  | and the people you seem to be depending on for support , and  --  and that 's what frightens them .... It frightens me . " " I 'm depending upon the National Committee , " he said , " and I think a majority is for me . What more do I have to depend upon ? " " And do n't be disingenuous , " she said with a sudden desperate harshness . " You know who I mean , you know who I mean . Now , stop it ! " " I 'm afraid I do n't , " he said , and abruptly his voice seemed to be growing calmer as hers became more agitated . " If you mean the legitimate protest groups ? " " ' Legitimate ! ' Oh , Ted ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't legitimate , what they 're doing . It is n't legitimate for you to go sneaking off with them and connive at  --  at ? " " At what ? " he demanded , and there was no more supplication or apology in his voice at all . " Exactly what claptrap has Helen-Anne been giving you , anyway ? " " It is n't claptrap , " she said . " She told me she saw you go into that room with those men , and just now I heard on the radio that they 've formed this National Antiwar Congress to meet when the National Committee does . You told them to do that . And who knows what sort of horrible things will happen when they have their rally ? How can you control them ? What makes you think they wo n't control you ? Oh , Ted , " she said , more quietly , " I am so worried for you . " " I 'm all right , " he said with a sudden anger in his voice . " I am all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a screaming gossip about all this . She does n't know who was in that room , or anything about it . She wo n't find a shred of evidence to support this cock-andbull story of hers ? " " I suppose you 've bought it all up , " she said bitterly . " Jason money can do anything . " " What would be the point in buying it all up ? " ' he inquired calmly . " What 's so shameful about all this , even if it were true ? Ca n't a candidate confer with his supporters ? Has that become illegal now ? " " But such supporters , " she said with a sudden sad quietness . " Oh , my dear , such supporters ! . . . Well , there 's no point in continuing this . You 'll do what you want to do , I 'm sure . But I fear for you , my dearest  --  I fear for you . Do be careful . Do n't let them hurt you  --  or the country . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put into his voice a lightness that did n't quite come off . " Now you 're being much too , much too serious . Nobody is going to hurt me , or the country either .  | I can control it . It 's just a move in the game that 's got to be played out here while the National Committee makes up its mind , that 's all . It really is n't anything for you to worry about . " " I hope so , " she said in a desolate voice . " Oh , my dear , I hope so . " " Come to me , Ceil , " he said softly . " I need you beside me now . " " Good night , " she said . " Good night . " " Ceil ? " he began with a sudden desperation , but the line went dead at " Vistazo . " Slowly he put down the phone in Patsy 's silent house . Abruptly the insistent unfounded terrors of the night returned . In half a dozen hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country by his country 's President ; by a man who now opposed him , but whose opinion , in some curious way , he still respected ; and by his wife . From each in turn he had hoped to receive the support that would have enabled him to repudiate and turn away from the vortex they told him he was being drawn into , yet from each he had received only warnings , worries , condemnation . He had not received help . It did not occur to him , in this dreadful lonely dead of night in Dumbarton Oaks , that the reason they did not give him help might be because he had not made it clear that he was asking help . And peri , his was just as well that he did not realize this , for if he had , he might : lso have realized that he had gone so far down his desperate ro l that it was impossible for him either to ask or accept . They thought " help " was to persuade him to give up his ambition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not  --  could not  --  do . " Help " in his mind was how to get there without being thrown back completely for support upon the forces of violence active in the country . These in truth seemed to him at the moment to be the most effective and decisive elements in achieving what he wanted , and while he had suffered some misgivings about them in recent days , he no longer felt so uneasy . He , too , deplored their excesses , but had they not assured him tonight that these were isolated examples ? Had n't Freddie Van Ackerman , much more respectful and obliging than he had been in the convention 's closing hours , told him , " Hell , Ted , you have to allow for a little human nature , but we 've got it under control now , and it wo n't happen again " ? Had n't LeGage Shelby , abandoning his stagey , show-off vulgarities about the white man , actually sounded like the brilliant college graduate he was when he had agreed solemnly , " From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignified ? " Had n't even lumpish Rufus Kleinfert nodded ponderously and echoed , " Ve vant to make our pointss like Americans ? " And when he had suggested  | or had someone else ? He could not be entirely sure , such had been the vigor of their discussion , but he knew he was the one who synthesized and gave it form  --  the creation of a joint command for all the antiwar , black-racist and neo-isolationist groups in the country , had it not been agreed at once that it would proceed in an orderly and lawabiding manner toward the achievement of its objective , the election of Edward M. Jason as President and , through him , an end to the wars ? The creation of the National Antiwar Activities Congress ? " NAWAC " was , in his estimation , a real triumph on his part , and in fact a very practical answer to just those doubts raised by Ceil , Bob and the President . They had all been so basically hostile to him that he had not been able to explain it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than that , Jason pride  --  but in NAWAC he had produced the formula by which protest could be channeled , legitimatized , made respectable , put back in the mainstream of American society . This had been a major accomplishment , and while he was not yet ready to reveal his participation  --  which was why he was so deeply annoyed with Helen-Anne for apparently scurrying about trying to get everyone alarmed , without knowing the facts  --  he was well satisfied . It represented a constructive , sensible and patriotic act , definitely minimizing , if not altogether removing , the influence of the Communists , kooks and crackpots whose violent outbursts had in recent days so seriously upset the country and his own campaign . Granted , not everyone could put the genie back in the bottle . But he was about to prove that he could . And would . Nothing now could shake his confidence in himself . He was doing exactly what Cell and the others wanted him to do : control the violence . And they wanted him to abandon the cause just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were they so fearful , so unimaginative , so obtuse ? And why , in Patsy 's silent house , was he suddenly shivering himself ? And who , in the haunted two cities in the ominous night , was walking on whose grave ?  | NATIONAL COMMI'l 1'EE MEMBERS ON SOCIAL , SIGHTSEEING BINGE AS THEY AWAIT BIG DAY , the Star headlined Helen-Anne 's column on their activities three days later ; STAND-BY PERIOD MEANS " RED-CARPET WHIRL " FOR FATEFUL HUNDRED AND SIX . " Washington , " she wrote , " has rarely thrown the like of the roundthe-clock party it is giving this week for the most important hundred and six people in the world  --  the members of the National Committee who are awaiting the start of the fateful meeting at which they will select a Presidential candidate to succeed the late President Harley M. Hudson . " From Alabama 's Helen M. Rupert and Henry C. Godwin to Wyoming 's Alice Lathrop Smith and Ewan MacDonald MacDonald , the national Committeemen and women are having a red-carpeted whale of a time . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception given by Patsy Jason Labaiya at which the two top contenders , her brother , Governor Edward M. Jason of California , and Secretary of State Orrin Knox , plus new President William Abbott , laid down the battle lines for the contest to come . " a . A dinner party at Sots Hollow , ' fabulous Revolutionary-days estate of Mrs. Hattie Hamill Johnstone , ageless duenna of Washington society , at which Committee members first dined on diamond-studded gold plates , then whooped it up at an old-fashioned square dance amid seventeen cows , twenty-three horses and fifty-eight tons of hay flown in especially for the occasion . " 3 . A Potomac cruise to a White House reception at Mt . Vernon , given two days ago by the President and the full Cabinet  --  this one very sedate with no fireworks , thank you very much ! " 4 . A reception given by the dean of the diplomatic corps , His Excellency Willem van der Merwe , at the South African Embassy , attended by fifty-one nations that are presently speaking to South Africa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by His Excellency Ras Tafari Tudwa , attended by sixty-seven nations that presently are not speaking to South Africa . " 6 . A joint dinner given by the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations , the National Committee for a More Effective Congress , and the Over-  | All Study Group on Improving Just About Everything in Washington . " 7 . Innumerable receptions , cocktail parties , dinners , brunches , teas , lunches , given by the various Congressional delegations for their respective National Committeemen and women . " This capital , which does half its business at social functions and lives in a perpetual daze  --  and haze  --  of sociopolitical entertaining , has never seen the like . " If Committee members do n't start their rendezvous with destiny next week with the biggest hang-over in history , it wo n't be Washington 's fault . Everybody is doing his , or her , best ! " But there was , of course , a darker side ; and as she sat at her cluttered desk in the Monday-morning-noisy newsroom , she reflected thoughtfully on how little the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in the beautiful city where its fate was decided . She was not the only reporter in Washington who had been tipped to various strange events in the past several days : ominous , anonymous telephone calls to certain Committee members urging their support for Ted Jason , more open attempts to influence them through direct interventions by powerful political and financial leaders in their states , even , in three or four cases , veiled but unmistakable threats of physical reprisal if they did not support the Governor 's cause . She was not the only reporter , but she was still the only one who was almost certain she knew where and when this new spurt of underground activity had begun . Or at least , she thought with a contempt that twisted her mouth suddenly into an ugly line that startled a passing copy boy , the only one who was prepared to print what she knew . Prepared but uncertain , at the moment , whether she was going to be able to . She had not yet discussed it with her editors , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patsy last week , that the Star really would back her up and print the story . Especially since the story was getting rather more sensational , as she dug deeper , than she had at first dared imagine . Her inquiries to the hotel , as she had expected , had met with a bland , blank incomprehension . No , no one at all had been in Room 1223 that night . No , no one on the staff had seen the Governor anywhere except at the reception downstairs . No , nobody had any knowledge  --  certainly no record  --  of the presence on the premises of Senator Van Ackerman , Mr. Shelby , Mr. Kleinfert , other than at the reception , of course . Actually , that room had been reserved for a Mr. and Mrs. Hjalmar B. Poulsen from St. Paul , Minnesota , but they had not appeared and so the management regretfully was going to have to bill American Express for it ; perhaps if madam would care to check with  | Amer ? " I just might ! " she had snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been necessary to collect one more lie : by one of those happenstances that occur quite often in the capital , her maid happened to have a sister who happened to have a son who happened to work as a waiter at the hotel . He just happened to have been the one to take drinks a couple of times to Room 1223 , the first time while the Governor was there , the second after he left . From him HelenAnne was able to find out a good deal of what she wanted to know . She had learned from long experience covering Congressional hearings , political crises and social scandals , that there was almost always one little link somewhere that somebody forgot to take care of . If you could just find it , most things fell into place , even though when she called the hotel again , the response was equally bland . No , no one had seen that gentleman either , except at the reception , of course . Yet she was convinced that now she had a good deal of the story and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced Washington correspondents , much of the rest of it . She was planning at this moment to do two things . One would probably not produce much response , but would be interesting as a further insight into a character she was coming to dislike and fear as she had few others in a long reportorial life . The other could be downright dangerous . The gaps in what she knew were such that she had to tackle the dangerous one before she would be fully briefed for the other . She made a quick telephone call , elicited prompt if surprised assent from the party on the other end of the line . Then she drew a deep breath , pushed her wayward hair back under the rim of a rather rakish green hat she had purchased just yesterday at Woody 's , tossed a terse , " I 'll be on the Hill , " over her shoulder to the city desk , and started forth . Already a shimmering opacity lay over the sprawling city . It was going to be another exhauster of a day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never know . How it functioned with it , he would never know . Somehow , he reflected with a sardonic little smile , it managed . Standing on the narrow balcony rimming the top of the New State Building , staring , with both hands on the railing , across the jumble of trees , parks , government buildings , rushing traffic , placid river , he could see the Hill where he had worked so long , the White House , almost hidden , where he hoped to work . He was supposed to go there in a short while to tell its new occupant the news from Gorotoland , and he hoped that this , when officially released , would brighten things  | a little for the country . But of course it would not for those who opposed the Administration , who wanted nothing less than American surrender , and whose joy , in this odd age , was not reserved for America 's victories but for America 's defeats . The dead weight of their doggedly sterile hostility weighed him down this morning ; indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail was still on duty at the house in Spring Valley , and he supposed it would be until the National Committee had rendered its decision , at which time , if the decision was in his favor , the Secret Service would take over . If it was not in his favor , he supposed he would still have to have guards for a while , so venomous and unrelenting were his critics . From Walter Dobius ' most recent column to the episode at the house at three o'clock this morning , he had certainly received full proof of this since Patsy 's reception . Walter had been at his smoothest , providing what to his friends , supporters , idolators and true believers must have been just one more of his brilliantly sound and balanced discussions of national realities : " Washington , " he wrote , " is awaiting with a somber unease the meeting of the National Committee . A mood of deep sobriety lies upon this restive and worried capital . " It wants a solution for its crisis , but it does n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't want a misleader . " It wants a President , but it does n't want Orrin Knox . " Thus the task which confronts everyone here is how to keep things on an even keel while at the same time aiding the Committee to reach the decision that will be best for the nation and the world . Perhaps not since the Constitutional Convention of 1789 has a handful of Americans borne a greater responsibility than the fifty-three men and fiftythree women of the National Committee bear today . Washington is doing what it can to assist them in reaching a sane and sensible decision . " What this troubled city is trying to do is show the Committee that there is a way out of uncertainty that will not create more uncertainty ; that there is a policy of accommodation which is not a policy of appeasement ; that there is a policy of firmness which is not a policy of fatuity ; that there is an answer to violence which will remove the causes of violence . " And from there , in a straight line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Governor of California , who would provide all these balanced and alliterative alternatives and in the process remove from government the ominous and destructive influence of the late  | Harley M. Hudson , his successor , and above all , the dreadful and dismaying Secretary of State . In any ordinary context , Orrin would have dismissed Walter as he had dismissed him so many times before , as the bellwether of a certain element and a personal enemy who had been after Orrin as a matter of spite ever since the Secretary rejected his advice in the first Gorotoland crisis six months ago . In the context of present events , he possessed more significance . All through the body of the column there had run the smooth rationalization of violence  --  and the smooth implication that violence must be appeased by a drastic change in Administration policy , or it would grow worse  --  which Orrin had come to recognize as the hallmark of the new Jason campaign . How directly his opponent was involved in this , he did not know ; but from what he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had arrived at a concept of a man rather far from the steady , unshakable , responsible leader whom Walter and his friends were so busy re-establishing for the public on the eve of the National Committee meeting . This newly restored hero of certain columns , networks , newspapers and magazines , this suddenly revived colossus , who stood astride the Committee 's path like some leader gifted to the nation by Heaven , was not the man Orrin knew . Nor , he suspected , was it the man Walter knew . Walter was too shrewd a Washington hand to be fooled for long by the caliber of the men he wrote about ; only his obsessive fear of the consequences of a Knox victory could be dictating his columns now . That , and perhaps things more sinister , which the Secretary could suspect though he did not know them for sure . Like Helen-Anne and many others in the deceptively placid capital that lay sprawled before him in August mid-morning , he too had heard rumors of pressures on the Committee , and of course he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy lobbying the Committee as Ted 's were , he wanted them to , and he had told them to go to it . Every possible source of appeal was being exerted to influence the Committee members who were either , to believe Helen-Anne , headed for " the greatest hang-over in history , " or , to believe her ex-husband , awaiting with " a mood of deep sobriety " their day of destiny . But he did not think  --  in fact , he was certain  --  that the nature of the pressures was the same from his supporters as it was from some in the Jason camp . Down below the customary surface of political battle  --  the calls from state and local leaders , the pressure from financial and professional
