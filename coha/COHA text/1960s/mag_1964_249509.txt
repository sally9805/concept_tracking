The Dodgers were in the doldrums . All spring long , Los Angeles ' world champions had been mired deep in the second division . Their fielding was sloppy , their hitting spotty . The biggest disappointment of all was Pitcher Sandy Koufax , 28 , whose golden left arm accounted for 25 victories in 1963 . Sandy was having arm trouble . He had won only five games , while losing four , and Manager Walter Alston even demoted him briefly to the bullpen . <P> Last week , against the league-leading Philadelphia Phillies , Sandy roared back to demonstrate that the scorer 's K still stands for Koufax . In nine innings , he faced only 27 men-the absolute minimum . Twelve Phillies struck out , and the only one who reached base at all was Richie Allen , who walked in the fourth inning , was thrown out trying to steal second . With the Dodgers leading 3-0 and two out in the bottom of the ninth , Sandy faced Phillies Shortstop Bobby Wine . The first pitch was a ball , and Wine fouled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wincing with pain , Vargo called time out-and the tension mounted . " Play ball ! " he finally called . Wine whiffed at a second strike . Then , Sandy wound up , kicked his right leg high into the air-and burned a fastball straight across the heart of the plate . Koufax walked off the mound , the fourth player in history to pitch three no-hit games .
