Uight times a week on Broadway and Li once a month on ABC-TV a brooding , gentle , autocratic , cigar-chomping , word-mangling , untutored , studious , impulsive , bighearted , gun-crazy aesthete and authority on military history  --  who could pass for a professional football halfback  --  works at being the funniest man in America . The name of this complex is Sid Caesar . Caesar 's Broadway vehicle is the musical comedy Little tile , adapted from Patrick Dennis 's hook-length double entendre of the same title . There are seven leading men in the play , the husbands and lovers of the heroine Belle Poitrine , and Caesar plays them all , switching character nearly 30 times in the course of each show . At various times during the evening Caesar bounces Out as ( I I an all-American do-or-die hero , ( 1 ) a doddering skinflint , 431 a debonair French cabaret performer , ( 4 ) a weak-eyed , weak-kneed doughboy ( " I 'm a rear-guard clerk  --  in case of defeat I type out the surrender " ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) a dashing and doomed prince and 17 ) a love-struck college boy . This protean performance is in itself a newsworthy feat . But the best news is that Sid Caesar  --  after faltering to a halt on television and lapsing into two years ' semiretirement  --  is hack at the peak of his form . The Caesar of Little Age  --  and to a somewhat lesser extent , of ABC 's As Caesar Sees It  --  is the inspired zany of the old Your Show of Shows , the man who accounted for  --  to quote Steve Allen ? " the few great moments on television in the Fifties. - But if Caesar is the funniest man in America during working hours , olTstage and off-camera he is n't even the funniest man in Kings Point , Long Island , where he lives . In fact , his little girl Karen did n't find out until she started school  --  from her classmates  --  that her father was a comedian , and a famous one . Ski worries constantly and about almost everything : credit buying in America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should light on a Sunday , then running out of church to make a sneak attack " ) , nonobjective painting and global peace ( " The world is like a baby with a loaded shotgun " ) . He also chafes . During the final preparations for Little Me , he chafed long and hard  --  not because of all the exits , entrances , cues and split-second changes but because he had to stick to the dialogue exactly as written . " I 'm going nuts , " he groused to a visitor before the show arrived on Broadway . " All the notes they come back with after every show ! Two , three , four pages what I done wrong : ' In this scene you put the left foot one inch too far in front the right foot . In this scene you fiddled too much with the left sideburn of the wig . In this scene , do n't say " thuh " ? say " thee . " This scene this . That scene that . ' 1 say , ' Hey , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boom Boom number ? Pretty good , hah ? ' And they say , ' Take it Out ! ' They 're right  --  sure they 're right  --  but I 'm going nuts . " Nevertheless his manager , Leo M organ , is convinced that the Little Me experience has been salutary for Caesar , heretofore a performer notorious for his disregard of the formalities of a script . " He 's needed this kind of discipline for a long time , " says Morgan . " I 'm sure that if he had known how demanding it was going to be he never could have agreed to do the show . Thank God he did n't know ! " Yet despite his lack of discipline Sid can be a meticulous perfectionist . Last year . after scoring handsomely in a nightclub date at Las Vegas , Caesar was haled in by Stanley Kramer for work in the epic comedy movie It 's ir Mad , Mud , Marl , Mud 1.1. ' arld . One day during the shooting at a seaside location Caesar came up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Stanley . Maybe you did n't notice , but yesterday there was a destroyer patrolling up and down out there while we were shooting . Maybe we ought to have it back today so the background will match up with yesterday 's shots ? " Kramer , who had n't noticed the vessel , put in an immediate call to the Navy , and the destroyer promptly was dispatched to resume her vigilant but gratuitous picketing . Noted Kramer after Caesar had completed his role in the picture , " This is the most thorough craftsman in the business , as conscientious a worker as anyone who ever did comedy , " This sort of contradiction has led many observers to the suspicion that there may he as many Sid Caesars offstage as there are onstage in bah . Me . Among other things , he might he tabbed a humble autocrat , a gun-carrying pacifist , a thrifty big-time spender and a hip square . At home , for example , Sid has been described by a woman friend in this fashion : " He likes to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know the bit ? ' The supper must be on the table ! ' I think Sid is finally resigned to the fact that teen-age girls do go on dates in 1963 , but he has never accepted the idea that they should . " Caesar himself puts it this way : " Kids arc growing up too fast . Fourteen , fifteen and going steady already ! Sixteen , they got ta have a car ! My older daughter , Michele , she 's only fifteen , but it 's a Federal case with her when I say I shouldinterrogate the boy taking her out  --  sea what the kid is like , what his father does , the names of everyone who 'll be there d think with with them , Michele the least y a ou parent should know . But was the Gestapo or something . " When 1 was a boy if I made a buck and a half t brought the money home-That was family income , not to spend . Then when I was seventeen , eighteen , maybe once in a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four bits on a dame ! Two seats inna balcony for a movie , two sodas after , home late  --  eleven o'clock . Take her in your car ? It was the height of luxury if your family had a car . The big event in our life was a day 's excursion to New York , all the way from our home in Yonkers . A full half-hour train ride . I mean an occasion ! My mother would rush us into the Roxy before the prices changed . Then we splurged . Six-course dinner , fifty-five cents a person . But one thing  --  I learned to appreciate every good thing ever happened . That 's what my kids must learn . A father 's got to be strict or they get outa control . " Nevertheless this same autocrat of the manor , less than six months after the storm over his daughter 's date , was rendered a virtual idiot on meeting his idol of the silver screen , Spencer Tracy . Sid tells the story on himself : " I was in Stanley Kramer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hollering along with everybody else when this stranger comes in the room . I do a double take . It 's Spencer Tracy in person ! Stanley says , ' Hi . Spence , ' and goes right on with the conference . Next thing I know I hear Stanley asking , ' Ski ! What were you saying ? ' and I 'm sitting with my mouth hanging open , afraid to talk , being in the same room with Spencer Tracy , and all I can say is ' Duh  --  uhnothin . ' And Stanley is worried maybe suddenly do n't feel well . " Freezing to the touch He was even more overcome with " humbility " ? to borrow a coinage from Lillie Me  --  the time he was introduced to President Kennedy at the National Press Club . At the touch of the presidential handshake Sid froze stiff . The color drained from his face , and he could barely move his lips . Manager Morgan , who was close to the scene , was afraid for a moment that Sid might faint dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did n't . Still another contradiction lies in Caesar 's attitude toward violence . A few years ago he went hunting for the first time and shot and killed a deer . When he saw what he had done , he cried . He has never gone hunting since . Caesar is also deeply disturbed by violence on television . " You know what TV is teaching our kids ? " he says . ? Violence is not painful ' is what it 's teaching . Bad Guy pulls the trigger . Wham ! Good Guy gets hit inna shoulder . always inna shoulder . He do n't say ' ouch , ' just makes a face . What 's a couple of torn ligaments , a shattered hone , a hemorrhage of the artery , maybe a little tetanus ? Then the guys tear into each other , chairs crash onna skull , bottles smash across the face , bullets rip through the guts , and who ever yells for a doctor or screams for an ambulance ? Whoever does is dirty , rotten , psychopathic coward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when realistic characters like Matt Dillon or Pod Ness do n't ever cry ? " Yet Caesar , the advocate of nonviolence , is an absolute nut on the subject of guns . He owns a vast collection of small arms , ranging from .22 revolvers to powerful big-game rifles . Firing at targets is Sid 's favorite recreation . Every chance he gets he gathers up his " shooting friends " ? none of them in show business  --  and goes up to his uncle 's 1,500-acre forest estate in the Catskills . The daily schedule there is starkly simple ; up before daylight , breakfast on steaks , shoot until dark , back for more steaks , pinochle until bedtime . The mountainside is rigged with targets . standard types as well as tin cans and bits of paper hung on trees  --  anything discernible from the shack below , So much ammunition has been pumped across this range over the years that the place has come to be known as Lead Mountain . it is at Lead Mountain booming away , that Caesar spends the most contented days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pacifist , but there is no subject that fascinates him as deeply as military history . In this field he is a one-man army of preoccupation , questioning , theorizing , arguing and impersonating everybody from Darius the Great to Douglas MacArthur . But  --  another reversal  --  any discussion about World War ill leaves him cold . " Strategy , tactics , surprise landings , naval campaigns , sieges , heroes , goats , bravery , chivalry  --  all obsolete , " says Sid gloomily . - Just push-boom-plop ; the button , the bomb , annihilation . Do n't talk to me about World War III , " Another contradiction lies in his attitude toward money . It offends Sid to the point of nausea to see people squander cash , and he will rant at length about it . " The worst is the way parents  --  at least in the suburbs  --  indulge their kids . ' You want it ? You can have it ! ' That 's the only consideration . When I was a kid and something was bought for me  --  not handed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day my mother said to my father , ' Maybe Sidney ought to have a new suit , ' was the biggest day of 1935 , believe me , " But although he decries the folly of other people 's extravagance Sid himself can be a pushover for a salesman . When he was preparing to play the Copacabana in New York recently , he thought it would be relaxing to browse among the East Side shops and galleries between rehearsals . But browsing without buying was impossible , His strolls got daily more expensive , until he decided one day he had to kick the shopping habit the hard way : From then on he always went forth unshaven , wearing dark glasses and a sport shirt , with his hat pulled down over his eyes . Caesar the art buyer presents another side of the man , but that side , too , is tinged with paradox . Sid is hip in the sense that he is aware of everything around him  --  fine arts , jazz , world politics , medicine , electronics . current literature , teen-age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standards of the professional hipster his reactions to the scene are hopelessly square . " I 'll tell you a tragic thing , " he said recently , with fervid concern . " This business of ' playing it cool . ' You take in colleges today . Brawn , muscles , football  --  that 's no longer the status thing . Now it 's intellect . Fine ! Great ! But too many kids are ovcrcompensaling with the brains . They think it 's smart to play it cool , ' How 's about going out tonight ? ' I 'm beat  --  cool it , man . ' ' Raise a little hell ' ? ' ' Cool it , man . ' These kids do n't cry , they do n't laugh , they do n't applaud . The only way you can tell they get the point of a joke is they sit there snapping their fingers . This means you really broke ' em up . " Take with the young Method actors . They wo n't show you their faces , only their shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on . No communication . Same with progressive jazz . Do n't say anything ? ' Play it cool . ' " One guy ca n't play it cool is a comedian . He 's got to say **27;2266;TOOLONG  --  or he 's dead , especially a new comic or one like me coming back on the air . Two questions have to be answered when I do a TV show : Did they get something out of it ? Did they laugh ? Doing this Broadway show is different . How many laughs you get , believe it or not , is not important . What is , is putting the audience in a mood for pleasure , so v. ithout having to count the laughs you know they 're having a night 's fun , and nobody is sitting out front snapping their fingers . " A musician friend , who has known Caesar since his Broadway debut in Make Mine Manhattan back in 1948 , said this of him recently : " Sid is a man with nothing average or in-between about him . He 's either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impression he 's withdrawn from reality when he 's down , even if you think he 's in a stupor  --  which is the way he usually looks at parties , which he hates . His eyes and ears never stop working , no matter how he looks , and everything he observes is stored up in that IBM memory machine of his . " These periods of silence  --  or recharging , if you will  --  are no fate developments in Caesar 's life . For the first three years of his life , in Yonkers . New York , he was vocally dormant . expressing himself only through infantile sign language . His parents and two olders brothers were afraid that Sid was a congenital mute until he relieved them one day by uttering his first word . There is no memory of what that word was , but once he learned to speak he did nothing about making up for lost time . His life ever since has been a grope for , and grapple with , the English language . In grade school he spoke only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaks . When he was in high school he found his first true means of self-expression : music . Specifically , it was a saxophone which an itinerant lodger had left behind in the hotel the Caesar family was running at the time . By the Lime he was 19 Sid had become a very good saxophonist and began touring with big-name dance hands . It was then he found a second medium of communication : doing funny sound effects of such things as telephone dials , slot machines and airplane engines . He was thus qualified for a job as musician-entertainer at a Catskill Mountain resort in the summer of 1943 . There he made his debut as a comic  --  one of his routines was his durable re-creation of an aerial dogfight  --  and there he met Florence Levy . When Sid was called into the Coast Guard later in the summer he and Florence  --  each 20 at the time  --  got married . They now have three children  --  Michele , 15 ; Richard , 11 , and Karen , 5 . The TV comic supreme In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his comic repertoire and eventually landed in the Coast Guard revue Tars and Spars . The revue was such a success on its national tour that it was made into a movie . The director of Tars and Spars , Max Liebman , eventually lured Caesar into the TV program that came to be known as Your Show of Shows . Qualitatively , Caesar was the supreme comic of early television , as Charlie Chaplin  --  in many ways his counterpart  --  was in the early cinema . Inevitably , thanks to the cannibalism of television , Caesar was deposed after 11 years . He was canceled off the air after his 1959-60 season . The medium 's defense was trite and airtight overexposure , low ratings , sponsor lethargy . Sid went into abrupt , total retreat , the longest lapse into silence of his adult years . At the time of his withdrawal , he mourned that the world had closed in on him , that he was through , washed up , retired for good . TV offers came in , notably from Warner Brothers , Revue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge them . He kept on reading ( the Civil War ) , taking potshots on his pistol range and brooding in his 18-room house on Long Island . Actually Caesar 's return was more of a bring-back than a comeback . With his wife Florence encouraging him and his manager Leo guiding him , he began to move  --  like a man undergoing physiotherapy after a bad crack-up . First nightclub dates and then four stunning appearances on the Ed Sullivan show . When one of his former TV writers , Neil Simon , told him an idea he had for adapting the book Little Me , Sid agreed instantly to do it . Then along came Stanley Kramer and his Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad script  --  also irresistible . The Broadway production was postponed so Sid could do the movie . Before shooting began , a third irresistible offer came along  --  a TV series . This has been the upmost of Sid 's up years . But in essence he is no different than during his downmost times . He still grunts and grapples with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not insignificant that his chauffeur and man-of-all-work at Kings Point is a deaf-mute . Nor that of all the plays Sid has seen recently he was most impressed by The Afiracte Worker . At the same time , when Caesar expounds on a subject he 's passionately bugged on  --  the Soviet defeat of the Wehrmacht , Salvador Dali 's Cracifixion , Alexander the Great 's occupation policy , the unique benefits of a broiled-liver diet , a new type of telescopic rifle sight  --  he can be as persuasive as any pitchman . When words fail him , his face , his eyes , even his nostrils pick up the theme . And , of course , there are his hands , meaty , strong , expressive . There is a story that Sid , while in Los Angeles last summer took his tall , serene wife ( also a movie fan ) to meet Marlon Brando . Immediately after introductions Brando asked , " Is it true that you once tore a sink out of a wall with your bare hands ? " Sid came close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheepishly and nodded . " Yah , yah , yah ! " he said , his grin widening , " This was a rehearsal , a TV show , two , three years ago . They were driving me nuts with some bit of business I did n't like and kept doing wrong . Finally I had to walk away for a minute to cool off , and some guy onna set hollers , ' Hey , Sid , how about this ? ' and I holler hack , ' Yah ? How about this ? ' and I grab the nearest thing I can get my hands on , this sink there , and pull it  --  grrrrack ! ? clean offa the wall . " H is eyes lighted up with beatific pride as he went on . " Boy ! What a mess ! The pipes all busted , the water gushing out all over the stage ! " Suddenly Sid put the memory back and chuckled apologetically . " Do n't ask me why I done such a crazy thing , " he said . " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
